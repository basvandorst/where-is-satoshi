Your analysis is compelling, but you miss that crypto sold for Tether is effectively destroyed. Price is stabilized by destroying surplus supply. We have not seen Tether supply going down yet. Tether exchanges would blow up if speculators would simultaneously attempt to exchange their tether holdings for crypto that also have USD exchanges. In this sense aggregate Tether is also a short position in (mostly) Bitcoin, begging for a squeeze.

Although the short(s) would default rather quickly.

I agree with you that there is some value at the moment in Tether created by its utility. That is likely far less below the assumed parity with USD and goes to zero as soon as majority of the speculators decide to sell crypto, for whatever reason. Here is why:
Some crypto, let's call them shitcoins, are only traded on exchanges that support Tether. Some coins have working USD exchanges, lets call them simply coins.
People imply shitcoin USD value (and market cap) using:
step 1: 1 shitcoin = x Tether (on a Tether exchange)
step 2: x Tether = y coin (on a Tether exchange)
step 3: y coin = y USD (on a regulated exchange)
therefore, they think: 1 shitcoin = y USD. 
The problem is with step 2. Imagine how people have to run Tether exchanges: Only coins can cover real world operating cost, since they have a pathway to USD. Operators likely also prefer to store some of their profit outside of crypto or at least in coins. Therefore they sell or store away coins sold on their exchange for Tether. This means they will not have enough coins, should people prefer selling shitcoins for Tether and Tether for coins. They will unlikely use their profits to buy coins back at USD exchanges to support Tether. Rather they will let Tether default which sets the value of shitcoins and coins sold for Tether to the value of that: zero, since in such a scenario also Tethers utility value is also destroyed. You are right, me saying that crypto sold for Tether is destroyed was not precise. Actually: Crypto sold for Tether is not gone, but someone else will have them and not those believe to hold them on a Tether exchange.
I meant with short squeeze: Should speculators anticipate that Tether falters, they will scramble to buy and withdraw coins on Tether exchanges, which will drive up prices for coins.  The effect will however be limited to the extent Tether exchanges are willing to support Tether. As already said, I guess they rather default quickly and disappear with their profits stored in coins and USDs.

You seem to be ignorant of the well established research that people are unable to come up with sufficient entropy for a bitcoin key. Many bitcoins changed hands already because of this.
I am sure nearly every text ever appeared on the internet is unusable for this purpose as people precomputed lookup tables for them. If you add a new hashing algo that delays this only for a short time it. Maybe you did it and wait for idiots storing funds this way?

How much money private banks can create is a function of the reserve requirement and the rate they have to pay for central bank funds. The central bank can move those parameters at will, hence it does indirectly manage money supply created by other private banks. A central bank can also buy and sell securities on the market (since QE) and those actions directly and immediately change money supply. The Government appoints the central bank's decision makers and the central bank delivers the profit out of QE to the government which helps to disguise some of government's deficit spending. In result government's desire of easy money is implemented through alignment of incentives through private institutions. See how proudly Ben Bernanke offers QE profits to Government, here: [

The weak point is not the length of the key or the hashing algo, but that the input is chosen by a human. Humans are unable to come up with a text they can memorize but was not said by someone somewhere. 
The cost of precomputing and hashing probable keys (let's take the content of the internet) is manageable and storing a fingerprint of many pre computations is also manageable, so a probable hit can be calculated cheaply then verified even cheaper. The input set to observe is only the unspent UTXO of bitcoin which is magnitudes less than the blockchain.  You could come with calculations showing that pre computation is not manageable after a given length and uniqueness, but you can not enforce people actually using that length and coming up with unique sentences. They will either do simpler or reject your service. You are either incompetent or malicious advertising memory wallet to user.

actually you might be even screwed by the user who pretends the robbery after deliberately choosing a weak key. Thereby adding some legal remedy upside to his theft from other innocents. And you will ask yourself who was dumb then who was mean to you telling you all this without a filter.

BTW good hardware wallets generate entropy and optionally merge with user entropy. The word list is not chosen by the user. Look up TREZOR or Ledger in case of TREZOR also its source code.

You should not build Bitcoin software that assumes intelligent user. Since you are selling this on appstore be sure that you get sued, by some user that used a too trivial key and got robbed. They might be dumb now but they will find a lawyer that points the judge to a large evidence of security research advising against what you sold. Better accept my harsh advice and build and sell something else.

Erik made an error supporting Segwit2X and I am sure he learned from it. 
Besides that, he is an exceptional business talent who knows how to communicate Bitcoin's strengths such that traditional media and business people keeps listening. In net his contribution to Bitcoin was positive. SatoshiDice forced optimizations and I recall him  funding research on UTXO commitments. ShapeShift made alt-coins practically a side-chain to Bitcoin thereby  proving the concept.

Those bearer notes are still  more worth than an address without its key.

I am wrong if he repeats. He was wrong and that would not be changed with an apology. Let's rather judge his next actions than his inability to apologize.

Yes a full node is always better and a must for a service provider or a merchant. But one would also want to use Lightning on a mobile phone and embedded into resource constrained devices with least compromise on security and privacy.
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:02:04
The last one is a library like others on the list, they will be all needed to build a standalone Lightning Node. This is a more modular approach than others. Eclair and C-Lightning need a full node running next to them, the Go lnd has a similar SPV plan with neutrino.

Rust implementation is on the way. Probably combining below projects:
* [Rust language bindings for Bitcoin secp256k1 library.](
* [Rust Bitcoin library](
* [Bitcoin's libbitcoinconsenus.a with Rust binding.](
* [Bitcoin SPV](
* [Rust-Lightning, not Rusty's Lightning](

What PGP key? Satoshi never claimed to own a particular key.
@_date: 2018-07-01 16:09:08
To my knowledge Satoshi never PGP signed a message. Why do you think some PGP key is his?

You could have made a small fortune with Bitcoin in 2018, provided you had a big fortune to start with.

A miner can include high fee self dealing transaction into the block candidate at no cost, if the mempool is empty. It would be in the block if the miner wins the block, but since the self dealing transaction is not broadcasted, no other miner could include it and grab the fee. Doing this is rational whenever the mempool is empty, as it drives up fee estimators at no cost. It could be rational even at a nonzero fee of available mempool choices. I would do the math if I was a miner.

Anything technically feasible can be and will be tried including bribes for re-org. Arguing against them with reference to politics or community violates the value proposition of Bitcoin, that there are no rules above the rules of the executable code. 
In reality the hacker would not be able to use the stolen funds to outbid the bribe as taking the hacker's offer would result in legal actions against known miner who take it. Even anonymous miner would be vary of those hot coins as they could not be sold in short term to pay for electricity.
