Buy high, sell low 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:39:48
Well done!
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:36:41
The commenters really helped to keep it going 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:45:54
What happens to the BCH that was created from BTC's held on Coinbase? Does coinbase keep them or someone else?
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:27:00
Welcome to the world of speculating. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:24:05
Well that's shitty

Is that Shirley Temple?

It can’t really rule if hardly anyone uses it. It’s only bought by speculators. Not trying to troll, just looking at the facts.

You never wrong to take gainz. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:45:59
Sorry to be a downer, but this person is obviously a big gambler, so even though this paid out they will probably have a hard time shutting the urge off, gambling in other ways and possibly losing it down the road to something else.

We've gone back down to...Monday's levels. Hold and don't panic sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:19
I'm guessing people are locking in their gainz
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:17:32
True, it's just one piece of information that is morally neutral, not good or bad. To me it provides support to the bubble argument, but who knows. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:24:33
Yes it does matter. I think it gives Bitcoin less credibility that we don't know who started this, and also that person owns lots of coins. If they ever dumped them it would kill the value. Now if they cared so much to start this they probably wouldn't dot that, but there is some risk there. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:40:37
Explain why it doesn’t matter. I don’t think humans are very good at keeping secrets, especially forever. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:42:03
I understand why it’s like that but if it’s going to go mainstream people need to trust it. Maybe they will like we do, but I don’t think it helps having mysterious beginnings. Let’s see though.

Guess it's time to short BTC :0

FT said the crowded trade doesn't usually do so well

The amount of circle jerking on here scares me 
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:15:30
haha, nice catch 
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:56:21
Welcome to the Wild West! I hope you have a strong stomach. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:41:30
It's great, especially if you like steak and Malbec. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:06:18
Yeah the level of confirmation bias on here is incredible. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:10:18
Just a number? It's not a 40th bday party, we be trying to make some dough here. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:50:17
Anyone else think he's Satoshi?
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:34:25
Do you spend bitcoin?
