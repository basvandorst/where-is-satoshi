I sent this Segwit transaction to another Segwit address more than 2 hours ago for $10.08 and it is not confirmed.

No upgrade will ever retain "every single user".  The bar cannot be set at every single person who holds a satoshi plus every full node runner.  The truth is that users do not need to run a node or do anything special.  Regardless of the node software you run on your home pc, at the 2x upgrade block you will still own BTC on the winning chain.
The compromise and the timeline has been set.  u/evoorhees is doing his best here to point out we have full consensus if Core jumps in feet first, but this upgrade will happen with or without Core.  2MB is not worth splitting the network over and Core has to show compromise to retain in good standing with the rest of the economic community (exchanges, miners, merchants).  Imagine the price jump we could have with full participation.

Bitcoin Unlimited is compatible with Segwit2x.  I am taking a calculated risk, buy up my tokens if LOL to you.

Also not seeing the correlation to the altcoin.  The upgrade block height is written into the code, failure will be decided within hours to days after that block.  Premature eblockulation.

Replay protection will be ignored on this upgrade, even if optionally added.  Either the three repo's my link above win or the Core chain will, and that is the purpose of the chain split tokens.

I think I am going to take the 12:1 odds on the Bitfinex BCU token.  The counter party risk is worth the extra 10 coins above your 2:1 offer IMO.  If anyone wants to take the other side of this order, you will find 26.8 coin buy order waiting for a seller at $350.

I think BIP91 was 80%.  Not sure where I got the 75% number from, but it was in my head that the miners needed to retain 75% NYA approval or there would be no action taken to fork.

Right or wrong, the hard fork code requires 75%.  The repo has been frozen and they will not up it to a 90% requirement.  If not below 75%, then the minority hash rate will just give you the estimated amount of time it will take to mine a block.

I am pretty sure both sides have already agreed to disagree.  One side believes 2x will not even be attempted or it will fail.  The other side will absolutely upgrade in 45 days.  Bets are being made, no one is going to back down.
It is in the best interest of Bitcoin for Core to defend themselves.   If a block on the Core chain is found every 1-2 hours on average post-fork with no replay protection, what will Core do specifically to defend themselves?
The miners and the NYA signers are going to be ready for the upgrade.  Image a scenario where half the exchanges halt BTC trading to let this play out.  The other half are NYA signers or quiet 2x supporting merchants and exchanges behind the scenes running btc1.  What will Core do if the exchanges that were waiting it out slowly start coming online with the chain that is 10x longer?
Most importantly, how to "defend ourselves" if the minority chain is going to be exposed to 51% attacks running Core software to maliciously jack up the transaction chain.  What is the plan to defend against this?  What if Slush pool is DDOS'ed right at the fork block?

What corporation is taking over Bitcoin?
