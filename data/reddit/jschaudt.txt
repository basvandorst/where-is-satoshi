There is a roadblock of 1000 bitcoin right now sitting at $699 on the asking price. I say do nothing as they dump their coins. Don't sell and make it more profitable for the person or people. Just sit, wait and BUY when the time comes.

Is that listed on the meetup website domain?

Broker's make you just that.... Broke(r). It is a tech geek's dream, which should be a wall street mogul's nightmare. We all can do it ourselves. Everyone takes fees, but if you found someone to help you out, and they didn't come from your local computer repair shop, then they are just there to take your mBTC.  The security factor isn't a problem. It is a blessing. It makes you wiser.

However much I'd love to have my retirement taken care of by my kid, can this wait at least until he is in his teens?

I've set up a wallet, and given them enough info to track it, and know who I am. With the price of bitcoin going down, I'm going to be sure to track the worth at the time of deposit, and be nice enough to give the higher amount, not the actual worth if it is still down. However, if it goes up, more power to them, and they get the higher dollar value either way.

I read my post to him before sending it out. I'm hoping it will be a lesson in learning about investing and relaxing, and it seems to be working. 
And yes, letting him know that 2 other people don't like the idea of $3 bitcoin is helping. I don't want to see it tank so far that it would mean the system is broken, and the world is full of fleeting investors.

OMG. Yes, I know that story, but on a smaller minimum in a credit union. I should say, you deposit 1045, wait a while more, and take the 1000 out. He'd truly stare at me thinking I'm a total moron.

It is easy enough to sell to be used. I'm hoping more science charities/ fundraisers will give it a try from the beginning of the fund raising drive. Now to continue hoping my image gets seen and shared on the Book of Face sometime.

Oh she'd like you. She's a better grammer nazi than me.
However, if anyone would like to work with a small, certified Minority Owned Business that accepts bitcoin, she can help with that.

A touch of the attention deficit for him wanting it to hit $3. Trust me, I'm doing the best I can with a kid who is 100% to the Moon in daily life without knowing SQUARE ONE about bitcoin until now. He understand that the $3 per 1BTC investors who have held on are in a good purchasing position right now for physical goods and gift cards.
At least he gets it as an investment towards the upcoming holiday or birthday, not a buy and sell today thing.  Heck, I can't even get my USD into bitcoin in less than 5 days anyways. So it could be up, or it could be down by the time the goods buying power arrives.
