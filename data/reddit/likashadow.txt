Just paid for my hotel reservation.  It cost me more than using my Amex which gives me insurance and cashback.  On top of that I paid coinbase commission to get my bitcoin.  Still worth it! Doing my best to suck $ out of the FED system.

Explain how you lost them.  You got felt and then multiple transactions  where created; and just how did that turned into a loss of 3coins? 
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:11:02
don't buy more than you can lose and absorb the loss as tuition expense.

In mycelium, I believe you could have a combination of  regular keys and HD wallet. When they changed it to HD they kept the option to import single keys.  Maybe you had coins on both the HD wallet and some other address you imported. Good luck

Yet somehow buyers acquired those coins.  They either bought them with $ or earned them.  As BTC grows, using earned coins will grow but for now it is a simple $=&gt; i/o.  Closing exits for BTCs is not important.  Augmenting the ability to earn coins is where the health of Bitcoin lies.  Look for ways to use your coin so that they're recycled, meanwhile, reward those who accept it even if it's just an $ exit door.  There are unintended consequences that can only appear through the higher transaction volume created by BitPay.

This report probably ended up costing 100,000 usd of VIP hourly rates. Anyone with a few hours of bitcointalk.org light reading could have given them the same conclusion for free!

Because the Brits already took a hit. 1.49 - 1.37 drop in the $/£. They're not going to assume the loss and switch now after the drop.

Coinbase! can't you see? Solve your issues in house and this bad karma doesn't have to keep spilling onto everyone's view. maybe lying for all I know, but, seeing how you frequently put off fires here on reddit, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and chalk one up against you. Sadly, because I loved the fact that you guys where one of the first painless exchanges.
Sore Coinbase user

Try support
Is not until you build up a nice discussion here on reddit that they'll take care of you like they should.
I'm documenting my issue step by step just in case I need to beg for support on r/bitcoin. 
Hint to Coinbase is about the inability to close the account and withdraw my coins.
@_date: 2016-05-10 02:52:14
Ha! good one. They parrot their TOS without giving your reasons any weight. I closed mine after I gave up trying to reason with them. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 12:20:17
I know reddit has become Coinbase's users forum of last recourse. Think about it, a company that has a help system, a support email, and the only way to get to them is presenting your case to the world at large. They know bitcoin lives amongst subreddits &amp; forums and their reputation would pay a price in this arena. I documented my case well enough to shame them here in to submission but decided against it. I'm not sure why I did though...Never got my issue resolved.

For every reddit/twitter complaint there are multiple in-house ones. It's probable that and issue unanswered  becomes answered  I can't fathom why you would continue such image damaging M.O. unless you have no control. 
Coinbase has been an important entry point to the cryptocoin superhighway from the beginning and that's why I prefer not to bash them more.

The question is how much more than we think it's possible. Going extreme do you think they set up honeypot stores to tie the loose knots of scattered info p2public.key or their own exchanges to monitor flow of capital? We all know that you can't trade btc on craigslist without them treating you like you're dealing illegal substances. 
What other ways do you think they datamine the bitcoin world? Is r/bitcoin one of their mines for info?
@_date: 2016-07-13 22:33:01
IMHO, Laundering is legal because it's only the process to clean dirty money. What's not legal is the method used to obtain dirty money. 
If you're emulating the process you may become the target of law enforcement agencies in search of dirty money. Even if you're "laundering" clean money.
Anonymizing money is not illegal; it's severing ties to previous transactions and it's participants. Such action with bitcoin it's becoming increasingly difficult to achieve.
