Could you tell me what's 0.16 or where can I read about it? I'm trying to educate myself more.

Stop sell % of what you own, hodl the rest. With futures coming and the price going up so fast it would be smart thing to do imo. At least that's what I am gonna do.

@_date: 2017-12-18 23:13:39

It really depends on how much you believe it's gonna crash, how badly it crashes if so, and how long it stays low if so. Assuming you figured all of those 3 out you should probably have a good idea of how safe you feel and how much you'd rather cash out at X prices. Keep in mind I'm just some random newbie on reddit like most people on this sub, so definitely don't take anything what I'm saying for granted. It's just what I think it's reasonable thing to do.

Hello, I have few questions.  
1. Could someone explaing to me in a simple way what are Segwit and Lightning Network and what is their solution to scaling ?  
2. Do the Dev team have any solution to scaling that they are working on, or are they hoping community will come up with 2nd layer solutions ( off chain) like Lightning Network to update to it accordingly?  
3. Could you list other things that thee Dev team is working on at the moment?  
4. What is the difference between a miner and a node?  
5. Does Bitcoin have any other problems than scaling? For me personally, for Bitcoin to succeed as currency we need these four things to be maintained or improved on: security, decentralization, low fees and quick transactions. Do you think that I am mossing something important? And how are we doing  in terms of security and staying decentralized?

It's abbreviation that I use for Bitcoin Cash, other abbreviations that I use in crypto would be: Bitcoin - btc, Ethereum - eth.

Hey! That's me too!

Lighting will be optonal same as Segwit is no? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:10:36
Why excatly have you put (deployed) after Bitstamp exchange, what excatly does it mean? On website it says it is deployed as well, while with others it says ready. Does it mean Bitstamp's Segwit isn't ready yet or the other exchanges are ready to deploy Segwit but haven't done that yet? I know it's probably due to my poor english but I wanna understand it properly. Thanks for any help and this thread.

Everyone would buy more at 8 or 9k. I doubt it would go lower than that. I'm a noob tho so don't listen to me.

When do you think it's gonna drop?

Fuck, I bought my Ledger from Amazon month ago. I've just sent them an email asking if there is any way for them to check if the device hasn't been compromised. Hopefully, I will hear back from them soon. I'm not sure whether I should move my coins to exchange or Electrum wallet until they reply. It worked fine so far but still can have some malware on it.

Bought 0.41btc at 4600$, 0.07btc in altcoin ( ltc, xrp, eth) back then as well. Yesterday I've got myself 0.7BTC which comes up to 1.1BTC. Planning on HODLing for a while now.

I didn't understand it 7 days ago when I started. Now I do more or less ( obviously less but I do get it). Why do you think someone shouldn't be in Bitcoin? Can't people start somewhere? Why not in Bitcoin?

So if someone has bitcoin on his Ledger wallet he still has to split them after the fork? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:59:33
So you won't lose in case it crashes to 0 (it won't but if it does you get some money back, at least that how people explained it to me)
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:36:32
But the split is only for exchanges not for Desktop wallets (I'm using Electrum) or hardware wallets ( planning on buying Ledger)? You won't have both 10 segwit2x and 10 Bitcoin if you use one of those wallets, will you?
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:40:07
Say someone has btc on his Ledger wallet, can he access the wallet through Electrum, would that work? 
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:10:33
4$ away. You might be right :). It's seems normal that people sell right before round numbers though. Should be tomorrow imo.
