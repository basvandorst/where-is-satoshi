While your statement isn't entirely off target, that's definitely not what a zero sum game means.

I have a slightly different theory.  The investing base driving the price of bitcoin is tiny compared to that of a stable stock.  It's also generally speaking young, and likely not terribly educated in investment theory.  
Feel free to point out the exceptions; I can take it...but my point stands.  This is a non-standard investment and there are no big hitters backing it yet.  
From my point of view...hold a bit of it and see what happens. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:52:26
I would posit that a $500 commodity crashing to $10, for any reason, would seriously destroy the faith people have been slowly building in it as a store of value.  Recovery would be, at best, *very* slow. 
That said, there are enough bitcoins out there at this point that I doubt any single holder has enough to crash it that low.  Even if they did, it would be pretty poor game theory to crash a commodity of which you hold so much - he'd be far better off selling off slowly and maintaining the faith &amp; value so that his last 500,000 coins are worth as much as the first 500,000.

A $20 swing on a $400 commodity is only a 5% swing.  Not "stable" per se in standard terms if it's a constant fluctuation, but certainly not the same as the $20 swings we saw at a $100 price point, resolving to a 20% fluctuation.

Here's the deal, economically speaking: 
Bitcoins are experiencing a potential bubble as interest rises, but in reality it's a supply and demand reaction at its most basic.  Bitcoin generation isn't speeding up and there's nothing anyone can do about it (which is the beauty of the system in the first place), and media coverage is very rapidly expanding the number of people interested in the currency.  
This is compounded by the exact scenario you've described:  Suddenly *lots* of people want a piece of Bitcoin, and equally suddenly *no one* is terribly interested in selling it.  
Simultaneously, as the value of the coins goes up, the interest in mining follows it.  The relationship frankly seems very closely tied together (though a bit lagged) - if your mining rig made you $10/day in December, it probably still does...albeit at a much lower actual bitcoin rate.  
Since the coins are divisible down to 8 decimal places, this isn't a problem...but the value of investment holdings is going to skyrocket for a while.  I wouldn't be surprised if the "bubble" actually solidified; the only real questions are how high it's going to go before that happens, and what happens when someone tries to liquefy some serious multi-million $fiat holdings. 
EDIT: 
I wanted to add...only a few million accounts actually hold Bitcoin right now.  Suppose it's 4 million; this is probably high.  There are 2+ billion internet users.  If everyone wants to hold the same average value of bitcoin that current users hold, you've got to multiply that value out to 2 billion. 
This is wildly theoretical, but that could increase the value of the coin by a factor of 500, simply due to demand, over the course of the next few years as existing Bitcoin is diluted into more and more accounts. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:33:09
Which is your choice.  The coins themselves are still safe if you hold them yourself.  It's like trading gold on the market:  You can trade a lot of gold without holding any in your hand, or you can work a little harder and pay a little more to actually secure the coins themselves. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 17:41:18
There are a couple of basic tennets involved.  First off, there are only a few existing currencies with similar scarcity; gold is the most obvious.  It has held value through the years in spite of its limited utility simply *because* it is both rare and durable.  
Secondly, there has never been a widely accepted and easy-to-move currency with a limited supply.  Try buying a cup of coffee with gold - it's nearly impossible.  People aren't equipped to accept most commodities for small transactions, so it simply doesn't work.  Technology resolves this limitation for Bitcoin - you just initiate a transfer, confirm it, and off you go.  
So why keep it deflationary, or at least firmly limited?  As some other folks have said, the point is (as much as anything) "just to see what happens".   Changing the plan would change the results; consider Bitcoin to be a grand and well defined experiment with an unknowable outcome.  You wouldn't want to mess up the experiment to try to extract desired results when the whole point was to see what would happen in the first place.

actually one of the purposes of the fee is to be mined.  The fees go back into circulation via mining, so as the currency influx (block value) goes down over time and the number of transactions goes up, mining will remain profitable but the proceeds will be from recycled fees rather than from new coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:44:47
That's counting on the realization being stronger than the pressure from the recent, massive, positive exposure the currency  has just been given.  
Look at it this way:  Everyone knows about the US dollar and the Chinese Yuan.  There's no discovery going on and if you want one of those, you just check on the market value and go buy it with your currency.  
The same is true of gold, Amazon stock, and rock salt.  There's no discovery process going on:  No one's reading the news in the morning and thinking "Hmm, rock salt.  Never heard of it, but I'd like to know more and maybe get some."
Bitcoin is quite different in this respect.  The pool of potential investors is growing massively at this point in the adoption process.  Every day, a million more people literally say, "How do I get some bitcoin?"
 
This fact alone sets it apart from most of the commodities and currencies out there, and it destroys the standard "rational behavior" expectations that we would normally see in a currency. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:45:26
So, it looks like Amazon has decided to start up their own little currency.  It has none of the decentralization that gives real value to Bitcoin, but at the same time, the average idiot can use it.  Honestly it looks more like store credit than a currency to me but they're trying to steal a little bit of thunder.

It's not broken from a usability standpoint.  The faults in it are related to hash collisions:  It's theoretically possible for two different passwords to generate the same hash, even within the constraints the algorithm expects.  
It's also a very fast algorithm, meaning  you can generate the hash very quickly.  Useful for some things, bad for others.  If someone has a sha1 hash of your password, they're going to make five times as much progress with the same hardware and time constraints towards cracking that password as compared to a SHA256 hash.

It's a hard concept to pitch on Reddit, but I assure you - you don't actually want to solve that problem.  Even if you could securely count each citizen's vote on each issue, by eliminating things like the *oh so evil* electoral college, you're opening up some serious mob power.  
Imagine the aftermath of a school shooting:  The mobs will ban *anything* in the weeks following an event like that, lead around by the nose by the media.  Imagine the foreign policy fiascos when folks with no idea who the prime minister of a country is vote to instigate an embargo against it.  
Whether or not the system is currently working, it's very important to remember why it was designed as it was.  The goal is to have the public elect intelligent leaders to make educate decisions for them.  This is called a democratic republic.  When you start true majority rule in true democracy, the lowest common denominators start showing up quickly.

Well, he's saying a "fake" currency will someday achieve 100x its current face value, when most ideas like this flop completely and never reach such a landmark.  
So, I'd say...eventually is good enough!

He's not ignorant; he's spot on.  People divide by 100 because they grew up doing it; asking them to start dividing by 1000 or 100000 causes more problems than you're giving credit for.

It'll net you about $4 per day, too.  Wow.

You can specify the fee on your client.  The higher you set the fee, generally, the better the chance your transaction will be processed in the next block.
The idea is that in 100 years, the fees will fund mining completely due to the sheer volume of transactions.  
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:41:31
You'd have to change the very nature of the voting system.  People already vote early and often; they're only caught or restricted because of the difficulty in and risk of showing up in person to do so.  In order to let people vote from their living room in *any* way, you have to register them.  This is your first hurdle.  
The next trick is to keep their vote secure.  How do they log in?  SS?  Some account?  How do they authenticate?  Can you manage passwords for that many people?  In companies of 100,000 people, there are staffs in the hundreds dedicated to securing information and managing access.  The bureaucracy involved in managing user access on a government scale is chilling to consider.

This sounds like a good argument for a "savings" wallet from which you never make a withdrawal (and replace completely if you ever do make a withdrawal).

As an interesting aside, I think if BTC becomes a real transaction currency, you're going to see it move like "real" money moves today.  Banks will hold reserves and your transfers will be done on paper, but not on the block chain.  This resolves a lot of the scaling issues. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:03:37
No, but that's an interesting thing in this case.  He said the price should immediately go up to that value, but since our actors are not fully rational, they hold on to the old value and drag on the price until the correction is finally accepted.  
I'm not saying BTC has a knowable inherent value, but a price jump as rapid as the one we're seeing right now could actually indicate a more rational behavior than it would initially suggest.  
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:45:43
Totally depends on your tech level and already-available equipment.  You can grab a nice 7850 for $150-200 depending on the heatsink, overclock it a little bit to 1150 mhz or so, and crank out 320 MHash/s :  This gets you approximately .015 BTC per day for around 100 watts of power consumption.  This is still profitable. 
If you have an existing computer with a good power supply and available some PCIe slots available, you can just slap a few of those cards in (1x to 16x converter cables work if you have 1x slots open).  If you want to build a computer, the rest of the components will run you a bit of money as well.  
It's not unreasonable to jump in if you want to gamble a bit.  Suppose you wanted to build a 4 card rig; that would cost you about $1200.  You could either buy 10 BTC today or run the rig for a year and mine approximately 18 BTC over the next year (assuming ASICs don't suddenly blow the difficulty rating out of the water; the sky has been falling for a year now and it hasn't happened).  
Bonus:  If you have 18 BTC and a mining rig in April 2014, you can sell the video cards and keep the nice computer, quit mining, and sell a couple BTC to cover your incidental costs:  Free BTC.  Assuming, of course, things go as predicted. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:46:39
No bonus, but the mining pool I used let you know if you actually found the block....which of course makes you kick yourself for not just mining on your own.
@_date: 2013-05-07 11:54:58
Yes. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:38:08
Call me crazy, but couldn't anyone who managed to snap a photo of that card then import the private key?
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:53:06
Could go either way.  I found a block a few weeks ago (in a pool, unfortunately) with about that much power.  Fortune favors the bold!
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:35:37
You're missing the point.  Fractional reserve banking isn't just something that the government allows - I can do it for my friends if I like, and a bank can certainly do it with BTC.  
Look at it this way:  When you swipe a credit card, do you have to wait for the "real world blockchain" of cash changing hands from your bank to your vendor?  Nope, the bank is trusted by the vendor to make good at a later date so the card is accepted "off the blockchain". 
That's actually the direction bitcoin *must* go if it's going to become a well accepted transaction currency.  You can't have millions of transactions per second posted to the blockchain; most of them will eventually happen off the record in third party systems with total corrections being posted in chunks. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:27:59
Fair enough. 
From a feasibility point of view, I'd say that any system implemented would be complicated at best (such as to be prohibitive for voters of low savvy) and fallible at worst.  Furthermore, people can wrap their heads around punching chads and counting ballots...can you even imagine the conspiracy theories that will take wing if pieces of an invisible imaginary coin are passed around as voting tokens?
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:49:47
I completely agree.  I guess what I'm saying is that there isn't going to be a lot of personal choice in the matter.  I can't see a lot of retail companies agreeing to the transaction delays and double spend inherent to Bitcoin by accepting it for instant transactions, just as I can't see all those companies waiting an hour after each transaction to make sure they're not falling victim to those issues.  
Bitcoin is a perfectly secure way to transfer ownership but it's got some serious drawbacks as a day to day transaction currency.  Operating on a trust system with mediators makes a lot of sense, and unfortunately I'm quite certain they'll try to implement fractional reserve when it starts to make sense to them.  
@_date: 2013-08-14 14:29:14
You have to look at the cost of the unit though.  If it was $4 per day for free, that's one thing - of course anyone would take that.  However, people are currently paying $300 for that unit.  At current difficulty, yielding $4/day, that means 75 days before it even breaks even.  With the difficulty increasing exponentially, I'd be willing to wager it will never break even as the profits will drop to $2, $1, and eventually the cost of electricity again.
It's too little too late from BFL. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:16:27
I don't think your getting it. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 16:25:01
I fail to feel sympathy for anyone who didn't see this coming.  The comments on that thread cover it already:  Why wouldn't they delay shipment, abuse the current difficulty level and the crowd-funded hardware they built with your money, and grab coins with the ASICs until the profitability fades?  
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:26:26
It just seems like a way to destroy the currency.  If you're collecting a percentage of transactions de facto, then you gain the ability to stockpile the currency.  Of course the gov't has little interest in actively destroying the dollar even though they hold the ability, but in the case of BTC, it seems they might be interested in doing so. 
So, they collect tax and hold the currency until they own perhaps 25% of it.  At that point, there's legitimate fear in the community of users that the price could crash at any time if the government decides to flood the market.   
Perhaps insolvent is the incorrect word; I was going for the idea that the currency becomes clouded by the fact that an entity could willfully crash it at any time. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 19:39:47

It's worth noting that that was the point where a *lot* of GPU hardware becomes nonprofitable.  Therefore, anyone running a significant GPU farm probably pulled the plug right at that point, knowing the ASICs had won the battle and weren't going away. 
This is pretty far away from the doomsday scenario where people "just stop mining", considering that there was a lot of underlying information spelling out the end of GPU mining. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 17:00:48
You didn't ask if it was profitable in the long run, only how to do it...so here you go.  Hop on Ebay, or buy new if you like, and get whatever you need to run several AMD 7850 or 7870 cards.  They're low wattage, give 300-450 MHashes each, and are easy to install.  If you are building a dedicated mining rig, just pick up a motherboard with four PCIe slots and extenders / 1x-&gt;16x cables for your cards (two of each for four cards).  Plug'em in, install an OS, and install a miner.  
OS doesn't really matter.  If you use Windows, just install GUIMiner.  Slush's pool is fine (mining.bitcoin.cz).  Set up an account.  Open a tab in GUIMiner for each graphics card, put in your account info, tell it to start mining.  
Put a copy of the shortcut to GUIminer in your startup folder and set the GUIMiner options to automatically start each mining process so if your box reboots, your mining resumes.  
Disclaimer:  Four 7850s gets you about 1300 MHashes at this point.  That's about four bitcents per day, or about $7, before electricity costs. Each card eats about 80 watts.  At the rate the difficulty is currently increasing, you'll never recoup your investment if you don't already own some efficient hardware.   Building a dedicated rig for four cards costs about $1200, so it would take you 171 days at the current difficulty and bitcoin value to pay that off.  Since the difficulty seems to be rising exponentially over the last couple of months, expect it to take a lot longer than that if the price of bitcoin doesn't rise significantly.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:07:55
Exactly; this is necessary to the spread of the currency.  Most would-be billionaires will diversify out of bitcoin well before that eventual worth is reached.  There's nothing wrong with some selloffs. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 13:57:25
This is a good question, actually.  It comes down to modern efficiency.  Quantum computing isn't magic; it's just another way of doing mathematics.  It doesn't immediately resolve a SHA256 hash, but it does move it down into approximately SHA128 runtime.  This, along with some significant computing speed, is no longer secure.  
The simplest solution is to migrate to SHA512.  This means QC takes us down to SHA256 runtime, which is still largely unsolvable using the residual heat of the universe (i.e., not possible).  
Why not implement SHA512, since we already have it and we see the need for it coming?  Well, it takes up a lot more space.  The blockchain is already 8+GB, it would be 16+ if all transactions were recorded in SHA512.  That's a technological barrier which should alleviate itself in the coming years:  Basically, by the time QC is mainstream enough to be a threat, bandwidth will have improved to the point that larger transaction record sizes are not a problem. 
That's one take on it, at least.
