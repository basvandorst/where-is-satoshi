Oh hello again...from that other thread...from before...
Seeing as I've just started in BTC and was very recently approved to buy/sell on coinbase, I'll be buying my first few mBTC today when I feel the market hits a nice low I'm comfortable with buying at. (That tip from earlier was from a mBTC I received as a tip a few days ago).
Can you elaborate on what you mean here? Do you mean hold LTC until a BTC price drop, then trade to BTC (and reverse on LTC drops)?
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:23:05
Well, you're wrong. More people buying = higher demand = higher price, generally.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:56:27
You won't make anything by mining.
As for "how to do it": SIDEBAR.

Sean is a really good dude. Before I ever heard about bitcointip, he played in a city I founded on a fairly popular MC server. He was helpful in our city and an all aroung good dude to talk to, then he vanished. I then found and realised why he disappeared.

I really wish I had bought in when I could afford it, I just didn't know enough about it and thought "why would I pay 7 bucks for a digital currency?".
Then yesterday I see a guy tip someone more in dollar value than the amount of my remaining school debt...fml. If I had just put $100 into it a year ago, I'd be completely debt free and able to build up a nice savings.
If it drops to $70ish again, I'll buy in. Make it happen please.

I've known multiple chantix users and a common theme seems to be "extremely vivid dreams and an inability to distinguish dream from reality". I had fairly vivid dreams when I used the patch once and it was fucking awesome. But I couldn't handle living in a Queen song, so no chantix for me. 
The great thing about bitcoin is you can't say "if I put the money I'd pay for smokes in BTC, I have x at the end of the year". You could only say you invested x. Your actual return could be wildly higher or lower than your investment. I'm betting in bitcoin doing well. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:10:02
I tossed in my first $50 yesterday when the price was at $850/BTC. I can look at that and say "Well, fuck, I've lost $x so far". Instead I say, "I've got .06BTC/60mBTC".
Everyone says "don't invest more than you can afford to lose", which I think is great advice and we'd all do well to heed it. But I look at this as a purchase rather than an investment; that $50 no longer exists for me.

The whole point is to *not* tie BTC to fiat.

I would like to know moar.^TM
Do you just make the trades without concern for the price, or do you wait for specific price points before each trade?
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:10:15
I see what you did there...
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:36:23
My advice would be to go with both gold and BTC. Gold for what you can't afford to lose and BTC for what you can.
1.75% doesn't even keep up with the ROI depending on where you are.

Gold is relatively stable, so you may not see much return other than a store of wealth that *should* keep up with the rate of inflation.
BTC is unstable, so you could make boatloads of money, or lose your shirt. The key is to not invest more than you can afford to lose.
You mention accessing the money on "short-ish term notice". If you're holding physical gold, you'll have to sell to someone and will most likely take a loss. If it's not physical, you may have a wait time to sell your gold. I'm not too current on buying/selling gold. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:12:43
If only I could be bit-rich. Unfortunately, I didn't opt-in early enough. I have a full .0015604 BTC to my name. I'm currently waiting for coinbase to verify my bank, then I'll be buying a set amount every two weeks without regard for price. Even thought I'm not bit-rich, I believe in BTC and I'm in it for the long haul.
That being said, those who want to sell out (which I think is a wholly appropriate term) because they've made veritable fortunes, we shouldn't pretend we don't know what they are asking just because we don't agree with their choices.
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:22:32
Cool, bro.
I bought at $850.
If you're actually upset about losing money, you shouldn't have jumped in in the first place. 
Never put in more than you can afford to lose. I don't mean just financially, I mean emotionally too.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:58:07
I can lose the $180/month because, well, I'm already doing it. :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:51:59
I haven't purchased any bitcoins yet, but I plan to. I was looking into different companies and you just won my business.

BTC is very high risk. You can get very big rewards and just as easily get very big losses.
Once you throw some USD (or whatever your local fiat is) into BTC, consider it gone. That fiat no longer exists and you now own some BTC.
Most people expect the price to continue to rise and if it does, depending on what you've put in, you could withdraw that amount after BTC appreciates so that you're investing "for free".
For example, say the price of BTC is $100, so I buy 1 BTC. When the price hits $200, I sell .5 BTC for $100 to gain back my initial investment, and now I've got .5 BTC that doesn't and hasn't cost me anything other than lost opportunity cost of the original $100 while it was invested. Make sense?

I've been researching like a madman. I have been experimenting with the tips I've received and figured it was time to try out tipping someone else.
My plan, once I receive my first order from coinbase, is to move those coins to a paperwallet and do the same with all future orders, then just sit on 'em.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:26:29
Nice piece man.
I haven't started using BTC yet, but I plan to. I currently smoke and I really want to quit. The plan is to link my bank account to coinbase and anytime I want to smoke, put the cost of a pack of cigarettes into bitcoin.
On another note, my birthday was 2 days ago and christmas is just around the corner. My present for both from my mother is to put some money towards my student loan debt. I make payments regularly, but she wants to help me knock the principal down which I really appreciate. I talked to her about BTC last night and asked if she'd be willing to give me the money she intends to put towards my debt so I can invest it in BTC, then cash it out in a few months so I can pay more against my debt, or cash out at the value she gave me if a crash happens. She wasn't going for it, but I tried.
Either way, I'll be hopping in soon (once christmas presents are bought) *and then I'll show her!*

Just the tip.
Just for a second.

@_date: 2013-12-01 17:37:18
You mean so you can buy in at a good price?
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:31:38
But I didn't just get tipped...
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:39:38
But what can be done with that info?
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:33:54
I'd assume those who are investing in LTC now will switch to other altcoins because they seem to have a preference for "whole coins" rather than fractions of a coin.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:48:11
Well, I just go approved on coinbase and I've got some pretty decent overtime paychecks about to come in. I'm hoping for a somewhat steep drop so I can get as much as possible for my USD.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:52:23
You don't have to buy a full coin on your first transaction, or any transaction.

They give away microbits, not millibits. So about $.03.
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:24:26
It's not so much an experiment as it is me believing in the currency and it's goals. I'll be buying even if the price goes through the moon. Only reason I waited until yesterday is because I had to wait for approval on coinbase and I wanted to purchase my first mBTC at a low price.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:06:36
Goddamnit. Beat me by 1 second.

3D printing a reliable firearm that has quality comparable to currently mass produced firearms is not possible with today's technology. I agree that "printing" a firearm would be extremely expensive and an exercise in futility with the current maturity of the tech. 
My issue with the statement was that 3D printing is "one-off". Given a good enough printer and materials, you can create nearly identical copies of whatever it is you're fabricating. Obviously we haven't reached this point with metal fabrication, but we're certainly there with plastics.

I agree that buying and holding isn't necessarily beneficial to the market, and it may not be beneficial to the individual. But those who are holding perceive greater value in bitcoins held than spent (a penny saved is a penny earned). The individual works for himself, not the market. You can't predict human behavior, and what may seem logical to you (spending BTC to propagate the market) sound asinine to someone else (who would rather buy and hold).
Let's say I buy an ounce of gold for $1000. If the price drops to $900, I would be insane to even consider asking the seller to send me $100.
If you intend to use bitcoins as currency rather than a store of wealth, starting thinking in BTC and stop thinking in USD.

Oh, come on. You know what he means.
While I believe in BTC and hope that the goals of it being the future of currency come to fruition, it's asinine for us to say "what means 'cash out'?" You know exactly what he fucking means.

Hey, I'm fairly new here. Can you link me to the charts you use?
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:05:05
I'm not speaking strictly about fabricating a firearm. My point is that you can create nearly identical copies of whatever it is you're fabricating, rather than "one-off". 
For example, say I want to make a plastic brush handle. I can create as many as I have material for and they will be effectively identical. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:48:59
While that's true, 3D printing isn't "one off". You make a template in something like auto cad, then you fabricate as many of the items as you want as long as you have the fabrication material for it.

I quit really easily when my wife was pregnant with our son. He's now 2 and I picked it back up at work. I *never* smoke around him because I don't want to be like my dad was in that respect.
I know I can overcome the cravings, I just need a couple days off of work to change the routine. I've been picking up crazy amount of OT lately.
