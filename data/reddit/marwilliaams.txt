Great work, great schedule on things
@_date: 2016-04-18 16:46:08
So  you're searching for a service that will provide you to send 1 USD in bitcoin with less fee right?
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:02:14
Well buy it on circle or coinbase, or maybe earn it
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:17:56
Great video, you make a point here, humans become credit card's slavers
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:08:36
 take a look on this
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:51:29
It's not a great service anymore, use circle or other
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:39:18
Is safe, tested and used really long time and no problems so far.
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:47:53
It's good wallet but circle is better option
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:52:48
Haha, great movie part makes me laugh 
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:28:03
 maybe you will find in here what you looking for.
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:47:25
It too small amount you have in there
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:13:49
Switch to localbitcoins or mycelium
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:44:37
Great show, worth buying it, thanks for the offer.
@_date: 2016-04-18 16:44:06
So this will provide machine controlled world right, terminator will become reality 
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:19:30
Use MultiBit wallet, it's secure and save and will provide you backup your bitcoins locally
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:44:02
Maybe it is good service but the fee is too much
@_date: 2016-04-15 16:20:42
This is awesome, hope I'll catch up.
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:03:55

Such a great thing, nice approach 
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:12:03
Openbazaar is you best option
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:21:53
Don't even think about, there were times when this worked, now more you lose than you gain 
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:32:07
this make me laugh a lot, hilarious!
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:38:27
Bernie Sanders seems is the best option, but unfortunately he'll never get chance to release his ideas. 
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:11:10
It's so wrong idea, mining with GPU is not a option anymore. Simply buy some from some bitcoin service, there's bitcoin guide post in bitcoin section on first page. read it more about it 
@_date: 2016-04-18 16:58:03
Nice option, but there're  other better ways to do this
@_date: 2016-04-18 16:51:09
Oh god, this is bizarre and ugly as well
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:33:52
Great to hear that you resolved this problem
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:31:02
Well if price go up, then reward for miners will be half then now so the answer to you question is probably no
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:50:51
Try circle, it secure and easy service for you to start with bitcoin, they have support too and it's online 24/7 to help you with all your needs

@_date: 2016-04-18 17:15:53

@_date: 2016-04-18 17:54:00
