Got an email from them (because I used to be on CAVirtex.)
Something seemed off in that email: they're allowing deposits, but not withdrawals.  So it's like, "You can send us money, but we won't send you money."  (Money being a generic term, here, referring to both fiat and cryptocurrency.)
Am I the only one who thinks that's kind of suspect?
Here's a quote from the email:

By the way, I do check this subreddit multiple times per day, but there's lots of discussion on other bitcoin-related topics (which is a good thing) and I don't always see any posts on the subject that interests me.  I also don't want to post a new topic each time I see a fluctuation, asking the same question every time.

I just have this aversion to the whole freemium concept in general.  Recent South Park and Simpsons episodes only solidified my resolve.
I've actually tested a couple freemium mobile games.  The amount of cynicism required by the designers to actually produce these games is pretty damn high!
Just say NO to freemium games!

I generally agree with you, except on the point where "traditional payment services are trying to provide the best service they can".  That's just not true.
They're trying to provide the level of service necessary for people to use them (and not alternatives) and make the most profits.
Now that bitcoin is here, they might have to revise what they think is acceptable (such as transaction costs, response/processing times, etc.) in order to be more competitive.
That's why Paypal's CEO is allegedly looking seriously at bitcoin -- it's a real threat to his bottom line.  If Paypal were really out to provide the best service they can, they would have been investigating bitcoin long ago, instead of banning all cryptocoin-related transactions as a matter of course.

Kind of reminds me of this story:
Back in the mid-60's Gene Roddenberry was trying to sell his concept for Star Trek to skeptical TV executives.  He'd give this big presentation, showing how he'd make it possible to do this ambitious Science Fiction TV show for a reasonable budget, coming up with ideas such as the Transporter, which was a way to get people on and off planets without having to land the spaceship every week.  Many other ideas were presented, and the execs listened with rapt attention.
One such group of execs worked at CBS.  They listened intently, then ultimately, rejected the project.  Then they turned around, and made Lost In Space, instead, "stealing" many of the ideas Roddenberry had included in his presentation.
In the end, we all know that Star Trek was the superior show, and became a much more lucrative and culturally-significant franchise, so Roddenberry won in the end.
But the fact is, the "dinosaurs" at CBS did have a go at building a competing show, choosing to steal ideas, rather than hire the originator of the ideas.  If their competing show had happened upon a better team of writers, producers, etc., and if the execs hadn't been burdened with outmoded ideas on how a wide-appeal show should be constructed, they might have succeeded.
My point is, I'm not sure it's a good thing to evangelize Bitcoin in places such as Goldman Sachs.  I see one of three possible outcomes:
1- They laugh it off and miss the boat (no real damage for us there, but no benefit either)
2- They buy into it, and eventually assimilate it and take over, like what's happening with wealth in general around the world (definitely a bad thing)
3- They attempt to build a competing "product", which either fails miserably (no real benefit to us, and might actually damage bitcoin by association) or succeeds (replaces bitcoin, and we're back to outcome 
I can't see any good coming from this.

Here's my suggestion: 20% of the transaction fees that currently go to miners should be diverted and shared equally between all individual nodes.
That's still a very small amount, but it's an incentive.  Plus, afaik, when you run a node, you have a wallet, so it should be easy to just send BTC to each of those wallets (I don't know enough about the implementation to be certain of the feasibility of this, however.)
Miners who don't run a full node will get a little less, though that amount is currently negligible.
One alternative would be a special address where BTC can be sent to, which would then split whatever amounts it receives (perhaps on a daily or weekly basis) between all the nodes that are up at that moment.  The moment would be randomized to avoid people going online just for the payments.

If the majority of coins are being hoarded, leaving only a relatively small amount for day-to-day transactions, and (I would assume) day-to-day transactions keep increasing, doesn't that mean there will gradually be a shortage of liquid coins for the day-to-day transactions, leading to an increase in bitcoin's price?
I mean, if more people are trying to buy coins for transactions, and the supply remains small-ish, I would think that would drive the price up.
I think that was the initial idea with having a finite amount that can be mined, as well as reward halving, etc.
One of two things can happen: 
1- demand will keep increasing, hopefully faster than supply (which will increase more and more slowly)
2- liquid bitcoins will become so hard to come by that more and more people will give up trying to buy some for their transactions, and move on to something else, crashing bitcoin's value.
I don't think 2 is all that likely, due to bitcoin's existing momentum, but it's still a possibility.

I know I posted this separately, about a week ago, but I didn't get a lot of responses, so I'll ask here: 
Are there any remaining trustworthy mining hardware manufacturers that make hardware worth purchasing?
I keep hearing about the bad ones, and yet, bitcoins are still being mined, and difficulty keeps increasing, so there must be vendors who sell worthwhile hardware, right?

I was expecting the Russian ruble situation to push up the price of bitcoin, due to Russians buying up bitcoin, rather than watch their rubles depreciate.
Maybe it'll take a few more days for this to happen, but it seems bound to happen, considering that even their heavy-handed interest rate increase doesn't appear to have stopped the rampant loss of value of the ruble, and nearby Forex markets and some online stores have already stopped accepting the ruble.

Miners: how much do you pay per kWh?
I'm not a miner (I mined about 3 BTC about 2.5 years ago with my laptop's video card, but I haven't mined since) but I'm wondering if the low cost of electricity here in Québec (due to our nationalized power infrastructure, and most of power coming from hydro-electricity) might make mining closer to profitable here.
Looking at my last electricity bill, I pay about $0.0859 (Canadian dollars) per kWh.  It's possible that if I started mining, some of my consumption might fall into a higher bracket which could cost a cent or two more per kWh...  but how does that compare with miners in other countries?

I'm from Canada, so I don't know how things might be different here, but I've also been wondering about the tax situation.
I've never purchased BTC, but I have mined.
The way I see it, if BTC is to be considered a commodity, if I mine, and then just keep it in a wallet, they can't tax it: I just produced something that's not money, and kept it as not money.  
Now, if I sell it, I might be taxed on capital gains, at the moment of the sale.
To make a parallel: let's say you do some work for someone, and in lieu of paying you, they give you stock options.  As-is, the stock options are essentially worthless -- they become worth something at the moment they are exercised, and that worth is evaluated at that moment.  So the government can't tax you until you exercise the stock options.
Does any of what I wrote make sense?  Did I get anything wrong?  Am I missing anything important?

cavirtex.com was recommended on another forum I was visiting a few weeks ago when I was looking to sell some BTC I'd mined over a year ago.
I was able to sell easily, but I've only been able to get part of my CAD balance transferred, due to various issues (the main one being that an unverified account can only withdraw up to $3000 per month via Direct Deposit, but they have a bug where even failed transactions count towards that total, so my failed first attempt at about $1800 meant that until that month elapses, I can only withdraw about $1200.)
Also, due to the recent bubble (and subsequent and ongoing crash) they've been swamped and are more than 2 weeks behind in their security verifications and answering support tickets.  I created a ticket around Dec. 1st, and I still haven't heard back.
On the plus side, I was able to withdraw some money, and once I figured out what I did wrong the first time, the transaction went through within less than 2 days, and was quite simple (all you need is the info at the bottom of a check from the account you want to transfer money to.)  Buying will probably require verification, though, which could take longer.

In any case, I'm not planning on using any of my "real" money.
I had about 3BTC that I mined around the time when 1BTC was worth between $3 and $12 (I'm only quoting those numbers because I remember seeing them when I was trying to figure out "how much I really had".)
I sold 2BTC at $900, and I'm keeping the remaining 1BTC for the time being.  I want to see if there's another, higher bubble.  If not, I've already made a nice, tidy sum, so I have no complaints.
My plan is actually to see if the price ever reaches around $2000, at which point I'd sell 0.5BTC, and keep the other 0.5...  And keep halving like that as long as there are more, higher bubbles.  If the bubbles stop or stabilize, I still have some BTC left over to buy stuff.
Since I didn't invest any real money, I can keep treating this like a game where I might make more money, but right now, I don't even consider my remaining 1BTC as being worth $500 to $600.
