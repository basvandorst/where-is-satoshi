Transfer funds... to it yes, exactly like the bitcoin wallet address.
You can’t transfer funds out of an account that you only know the account number for...

That’s not why. Transfers occur instantly in the UK/Europe so that doesn’t make a difference, they’re also free??
You could have another guess or just admit you don’t know?

What backward country do you live in fella?

Lol there’s no need to pay me anything, but if you insist - PM’d
Go crazy kid.

I see no reason to post personal information on a public forum, only you asked for it so I only sent it to you.
It may not give you the ability to transfer funds away, but if you gathered enough personal information then sure you could use that to gain access to an account that could then be used to send funds. A bank account number alone is worthless.

UK. Here you have to apply for a provisional driving licence that lets you learn to drive with an instructor, but it serves as official ID.

You’re oversimplifying this significantly. There’s a lot more required for a payment to actually clear.
If what you’re saying was true, if I gave someone my account number and sort code (assume this is your routing number) so they could pay me some money, they would also be able to send themselves all of my money. Which isn’t the case.

How do you set up your own node? And do you profit from running one?

I bought €15 worth the other day as a tester to make sure I could do it properly without getting a fee and it went through perfectly, GDAX is pretty nice to use.

Apply for a provisional/learner driving licence and use that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:05:00
Maybe, but also perhaps.

Download Revolut and open an account, one in GBP and one in EUR. Send verification payment of €10 to Coinbase/GDAX.. 3 days-ish.
Move bitcoin to GDAX, sell limit order to avoid any fees in EUR! Withdraw to revolut EUR Account, exchange for £ and withdraw to normal bank account...
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:52:03
Yes you can?
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:25:38
Me too please...
