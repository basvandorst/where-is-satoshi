I did it.  It's the easiest way to do it without a bank account or credit card...and it's instantaneous (unlike coinbase)...and no need to meet up with a random stranger (localbitcoins).
I saw it as another form of gambling: instead of burning a $100 bill on blackjack or roulette, I dumped it into bitcoin.  The price was about $700 at the time, so I've lost about 65% since then.  Not sure if I would have had better or worse luck at the tables. haha

Dude, from one app developer to another: don't take out your jailbreak detection.  The *main* reason people jailbreak their phones is so that they can figure out how to scam devs.  If having the jailbreak detection in means that you can prevent some of the scamming, then leave it in, man.

here's the rub: that "infrastructure" is the mining rigs.  the ones that become obsolete in a matter of months.  miners are in an arms race that nobody wins (except the folks that sell the mining rigs).

That doesn't stop the bots.  It just means more instances of the bots get instantiated.
