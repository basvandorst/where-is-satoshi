So many scams in this space. I guess it's cause it's so incredibly easy to steal funds. All you literally need is their private key...

Thanks for the feedback, I agree there were some parts that were sloppy :(

Why are people telling me to zoom out? When was the last time bitcoin's price stayed the same for the entirety of 15 minutes?

First the meteoric rise for about half an hour, and then it just flat lines instead of a healthy pullback?
