Just wait till you can't buy or sell or your money becomes frozen because you don't hold your own keys. Not your keys not your coins bro Robinhood is completely unable to buy cryptocurrency's. I remember the times were you were unable to sell your cryptocurrency's. Just think about what you're saying. I'm here to help

Buy This Dip 
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:18:23
So to clarify I have a bunch of lazy Friends/acquaintances/people that have never yet gotten involved with bitcoin they have money and are offering to pay me to help them start up accounts become more familiar with bitcoin and help answer any questions they may have along the way.
Also I come from New York sosaying middleman is pretty much a way of saying helping someone and getting paid 
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:16:35
It's all good Bitcoin swings a few K up and down and it's all good 
And as far as your coinbase question I always before buying see what they are charging for one Bitcoin... gives u a closer idea to what ur actually going to have to pay in the end
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:01:18

@_date: 2018-03-01 08:23:14
My friends asked me to set it up for them they offered to pay for my help... honestly I'll probably just help them set up an account or something and have them do it themselves... 
I'll probably just offer to take what they have and then buy it for them and afterwards just give them 
     .9 out of 1 or something...
just looking for a few more ideas on this topic would help

Ok so I speak weak noob bitcoin...there is talk of a dip in the value over all of Bitcoin here soon...  we're currently at a value of 11.3k  per 1 bitcoin... if ur looking to get in to bitcoin from a never before bitcoin holder, just keep watching the current price of Bitcoin through google... aka all u do is just Google Bitcoin price and wait till it hits prices below 10k ... that's par bitcoin price to me... if u see bitcoin dip under 10k your going to make money on it in the future... but we must create hype and business for bitcoin... because Bitcoin works on people actually using it and stuff happening with it... if it sits still or gets stale prices drop ... tell people use it and spread the word and the only possible outcome for bitcoin is upwards growth and there's so much more I got help for those looking 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:08:27
Thank u for your sacrifice 
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:40:53

@_date: 2018-03-01 19:08:20
Everyone seems to be misunderstanding I should edit my post and make it a little bit more clear... people that have no bitcoins that are my friends know that I have bitcoin and that I'm always doing research and getting new information and trying to stay current with Bitcoin they are offering to pay me for my time and trouble's 
 The exact things they want my help with are 
1. Starting up a bitcoin account to where they can buy and sell and store bitcoins
2. If they have any questions or need any information I provides it to them ...I do whatever researching and digging I have to find what they're looking for
3.  Pretty much doing all the work for them so that they can just pay for it and kind of be involved but have me do all the work
