That's just another $10B and another year for the Fed to accumulate enough GPUs for another long-range attack. The trust would be lost. I'd say PoW after the first attack is not a solution anymore.

I guess you havent read the scenario above. The attack would last for a year before announcing the reorg for everyone. So any (or even all) transactions from the last year would be reversed? All bitcoins you acquired in the last 12 months would disappear from your wallet. Would you be buying Bitcoin again?  
In case of somehow abandoning the attackers branch and sticking with the shorter original version, it would still use the same equipment to mine, and the attacker would still have the 51% of hashing power.   
Change the algo, and no original miners can mine it, so you would need to start building hashing power from scratch, which would make it trivial to attack.
@_date: 2019-03-05 06:30:44
Let me be more clear, the goal of the attack is to keep the USD as the only global currency.
@_date: 2019-03-05 06:28:13
Only in this case the hash rate is very low and it is even cheaper to attack the new network. The end of PoW. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 18:29:30
You have a few interesting points. 
Miners will only join the network when it is profitable. They wont altruistically burn their money to protect the network (maybe someone will). Ask yourself, will you be transacting on Bitcoin and voluntarily paying $1000 per transaction to save the network? That would attract the miners, since now there are incentives.
Litecoin, ETH or any PoW for that matter are subjects to the same attack. Spend another $10B and you are the biggest GPU miner. Feds can print money on the same machine to which Bitcoin is a threat. So no price is too much.
Of course, governments will offer a "safer version" of Bitcoin - Fedcoin with inflation and transparency (censorship).

Banning exchanges is not the same as attacking the nature of the consensus, when all of a sudden you can't ever be sure if you transaction is confirmed.
If your money printing machine is at stake, no price is too high to pay. Switch to a new PoW algo, and everyone will have to acquire new miners, and the government will always win.
@_date: 2019-03-05 05:09:18
So it would be the end of Bitcoin and return to the USD standard?
@_date: 2019-03-05 06:00:48
You wouldn't know there is an attack until after the attack which can be a year long. The only solution is a fork, then again, how do you keep the attacker from attacking the new branch? Switching to Proof-of-Stake?
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:00:33
If you lost all your bitcoins from the past 12 months, would you buy again? Maybe CPU or mining on a smartphone would be a solution, since everyone already has it and building more CPU power would be problematic. If a billion smartphones start mining - it is a yearly supply of smartphones, might be an inconvenience and would postpone another similar attack, but it wont stop the attack. What do you think is the value of money that can disappear from your wallet at any time?
@_date: 2019-03-06 08:53:08
thats where I got the idea
@_date: 2019-03-13 08:13:58
How do you think money is created? Or how it should be created? 
@_date: 2019-03-06 09:03:07
change the algo, and you have to change the mining equipment, and the government has more resources to acquire more hashing power. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:04:22
I also hope that the involvement of large institutions and big money in Bitcoin will prevent the government attack. However, IF the Fed money printing machine is in danger (meaning the US cannot just print money, but have to work and collect taxes if they want to spend) and the entire government structure of the US as we know it is in danger, then nothing is a too big price to pay. Especially, if it other countries who are losing money.
As per different PoW. All miners will have to switch to new hardware in case of changing the PoW algo. Technically, there are ASICs (maybe a few kinds, but bitcoin is the main), and GPUs. So the govt only need to accumulate those at first (which is a huge task, but compare it to Moon landing or a nuclear bomb production, and it seems trivial). The point is, the govt will always have more money to buy equipment, together with restrictive regulation to help. 
As per altruistic mining, maybe, also the users can start paying higher fees to compensate. Bitcoin is based on economic incentives and game theory, so altruism is not sustainable. Will you pay $1000 per transaction to fight the govt attack? 
@_date: 2019-03-06 09:18:42
Great resources. He is not addressing the scenario I described, though.  
The fees are only relevant when the government is competing with other miners and announcing their mined blocks. However, if they only announce their branch once a month or even a year, who would want to take risks of transacting. Introducing checkpoints maybe a solution that would make this type of attack impossible. Then we have the dynamics of real time mining.
I sort of have a picture of bitcoin surviving now:  
After the massive reorg:  
Introduce checkpoints
Compete with fees
@_date: 2019-03-05 05:22:41
I see there was a lot of discussion on that topic. Antanopoulos doesn't address this particular scenario. Lots of text on reddit. What's the consensus on what would happen or why it wouldnt happen?
@_date: 2019-03-05 07:10:15
Do you have any ideas for the post 51% attack solution?
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:35:00
Who tried to kill bitcoin and how they tried to do it? Has anyone built 51% hash rate facility and run it for a year to reorg the blockchain? Not to my knowledge?  
If you fork, there are 2 options: stay with the same hashing algorithm, and the government can attack it again; switch to a different algo, which would mean governments cannot mine it, but the other miners cannot mine it either, which means deployment of new hardware and a very low hash rate, which makes even cheaper to attack bitcoin again.
BitTorrent doesn't threaten existence of USD, and doesn't use PoW.
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:57:36
If bitcoin is a threat to the USD, $10B is not a big price to kill it. Even $10 trillion for the Fed is doable to save 100 trillion USD worldwide.   
Why is everyone so certain in the censorship resistance?
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:56:32
Well I posted in r/Samourai, maybe they will reply over there. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 06:26:20
Which is a smaller network and is cheaper to attack. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:08:31
It's set for segwit. Weird part, the samourai address calculater shows the addresses that are in the ledger, but doesnt show the balances.
@_date: 2019-03-05 06:19:39
I have the same concern. Everyone seems too arrogant here to actually think of the solutions. Involvement of the big USD money in bitcoin is sort of a safety net, since it controls the government. 
The only post attack solution I can think of is forking and switching to PoS of some sort. But it seems like there is no proven reliable PoS algorithm. 
The attack is definitely possible. Really, what's $10B for the Fed? Russia just gave Venezuela $17B, so even the bankrupt country can do it (though it wouldn't really make sense for them).
We should have a contingency plan, and before we have it, stop being arrogant and poking the USD bear.
