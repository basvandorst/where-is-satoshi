How easy is it to transfer my current wallet on Electrum to this new released version? 
Is it simple?

I have the same message, and account limitation but they want me to provide information on my 'Recent Sales'. I got this message yesterday, randomly.
I've got a 7 year old business account with over 15-19k in and out of the account over the years. It has to be linked with Localbitcoins, i have no other ideas.
I will call them shortly and see whats going on. Fuck them anyways, hate them. However, it's such a popular payment processor, i kinda need it. (Ebay, etc)

Haha what a noob, go away and play in traffic

Ps. I also traded on LBC with Paypal. Always bought though, never took payments from others.

Yeah unable to get my account back but ok as I got another.
Was you a business seller?
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:12:42
7-8 Years as personal, under 1 year business. Over 15k come through my account over the years..
EDIT: They emailed - with the header: "PayPal appeal refused". 
Fuck you Paypal

I think that was my failure there. I had opened a brand new barclay's current account, and within the week i had multiple payments from different people totalling around £1,700. Never banked with them before, but heard they were good! I was lucky to get my money back, i've seen a large amount of people who are unable to get into the bank and get their money back.
I was thinking just to go into the bank with a brief proposal of another business idea, and use that for doing my trading. 
Can i ask, are you involved with btc trading in the UK?
Thanks for your reply.

When he wins. I will give you my BTC address. Thank you and good luck hahha

I'll try my personal bank first, and let them know bitcoin. If they say no, i'll just try another bank with a different business plan.

Firstly, thank you for time and replying with some great information.
I opened Lloyd's yesterday just for a normal current account - i will look into their business accounts shortly. I'm stuck to whether to tell the truth and explain to them it works around bitcoin use, or go for something business tech related.
Funny enough, i registered for Coinfloor yesterday and got confirmed this morning.
