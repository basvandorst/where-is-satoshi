I've never had a problem with nitrogensports, however i only use it for small bets (10$-40$) so i'm not sure how it is for larger amounts. But they pay out at midnight everynight i believe

yeah they should be just fine. If it takes a little longer then 24 hours, don't freak out. I think it took my first failed transaction 26 hours or so. 
I wish they would fix the problem. Extremely annoying.

no they do not. They just sit pending on coinbase for 24 hours and then are returned to my coinbase account. Been having this problem for 5 days now. Still waitin on my ticket for an answer.

Sorry buddy, i believe coinbase is having trouble communcating with the block chain. I don't believe anybody can send out bitcoin from coinbase right now or atleast a lot of people are having issues. 
Me and another person are both having problems. I can't even make a paper wallet right now. If you are having these problems, your coins are essentially not transferable (unless u sell them) untill they fix the issue
