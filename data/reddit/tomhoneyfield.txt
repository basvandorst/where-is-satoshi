Hi, Just thought I'd drop you a reply because there has been some movement on this. I was about to log back into my wallet and attempt a "child pays for parent" transaction, as I'd found that this was a solid way of dealing with an old school wallet transaction in Electrum. I logged in and to my surprise the transaction has actually been processed, so despite the low fee, someone actually mined it eventually at some point in the past month. 
You've had one in limbo since December 12 though, so my guess is that every time you launch Electrum it re-broadcasts the transaction and no amount of leaving it will work, the fee must be too small or non existent. Are you still having problems getting it confirmed? I will post everything I found on the internet regarding child pays for parent transactions in the hope that if someone has this problem and ends up here, they find something that helps;
Obviously google will help but if google brings people here they might find this useful;
This link contains a user who has had the same problem as us, and the instructions given here are quite comprehensive. Hopefully this will help people with unconfirmed bitcoin transactions.

So essentially if I leave it long enough, it will "forget" the unconfirmed transaction? I'm worried that when I open the wallet again in 2 weeks from now the first thing it'll do is re-broadcast the unconfirmed tran, adding it to everyone's mem block again (I barely know when I'm talking about here).

Ok cool, so if I update the electrum wallet it will allow the RBF? I was worried that because the transaction occurred on 2.6.2 that I wouldn't be able to upgrade and do RBF. Again, just noobness on my part in understanding the block chain.

I am thoroughly entertained.
