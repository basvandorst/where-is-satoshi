is absolutely correct when he says you can't bring up fabrication regarding something you aren't being charged with. Courts are extremely specific in how cases are tried and what is allowed to be said. This is why the whole "objection your honor, the defense/prosecution (fill in blank)"; "sustained, the jury will disregard (fill in blank)" is done. That said, one can't entirely blame individual human beings for falling prey to such tactics by not actually "disregarding" such statements, one way or the other; it's just how we are.
So, "if the judge was able to consider the accusation of him attempting to solicit 6 murders for hire AS IF IT WERE FACT, without having to prove a damn thing" and Ross couldn't raise the point that it was a fabrication due to the limits in place in a trial, then certainly this could be considered as a reason for the judge's harsh sentence.

Indeed, and more than most seem to realize. Take a look at the one thing done by the federal government in the last 15 years that caused Americans to actually respond to something the government was trying to do. The reaction to the bank bailout was pretty strong, as was the SOPA/PIPA, but neither were as loud and forceful as the pushback against attempts to reign in the 2nd Amendment. 
I think many here in America have given up on fixing the system. We vote and protest and grumble amongst family and friends in an attempt to stave off what we see coming on the horizon, but people realize that the system is broken, the powerful too entrenched. So they wait and bide their time, hoping that enough wake up in time. 
Is this the best strategy? I don't think so, but I can't blame folks for not wanting to be the next Timothy McVeigh or Chris Dorner, trying to do *something* to fight back, and being painted as a demon by the media, while your brothers and sisters sit by and say nothing. Note: I'm not supporting their actions, just empathizing with what drove them to it.
