Yeah, right, they would have never seen it coming.  
  
Banks are where the money is at. Money rules the world. The richest and smartest people in the world are involved in layers of banking we can't even dream of. They're already prepared for things that no one has thought of. Bitcoin isn't going to unseat shit.

Bitcoin is a company that makes space cookies.

I wasn't looking at it as a way to make a quick buck. I was looking at it as a long term thing, but the more I've studied it, the more I'm convinced it's not going to work out in the long run, and there is no further need for me to be involved. Good luck to all those who venture on.

non-standardized  
difficult/slow to work with at the personal level  
hackable/too many mistakes  
not enough liquid cash to facilitate its already priced in value at the barely existent retail level  
big "power" bootstomps   
other stuff I'm not aware of/can't conceive of    
maybe I'm wrong, but I think i'll just invest in a stock until it sorts out to a reliable system if ever, then I will use it for what it is.

I'm out. Lost 15% from initial buys. Too much of an uncertain emotional roller coaster for a possible 500% gain. I don't see it working out in the long term.
