As said in the book "The Intelligent Investor": "Obvious prospects for physical growth do not translate into obvious prospects for monetary growth."

I mean you do have a point. Cant think of another currency even worth 1,000x the us dollar.

I'd love to use linux but that would pretty much fuck me in terms of whenever I wanted to download something being that most things only have downloads for microsoft and apple.

What are the best alternatives to Coinbase?

We've never had an issue with people robbing banks and getting away with tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars, and even if it were so, there are FAAAAARRRR more USD out there than the same worth in BTC.

I wonder why they dont trust it though.....

The thing about this guy is he gets money from preying on stupid people who deserve to have their money taken away. I'm sorry but I just dont feel bad for the people he's scamming because they're all too stupid to just google the shit he's teaching them.
You may have noticed after his original ad which became a meme, theres now a LOT of others doing the same exact shit. I say they should keep doing it.

People get hacked by stupidity? Then how do all of these institutions keep getting hacked with entire teams of people with college degrees for security decisions? I'm guessing they're just all stupid...

I was copy/pasting another question and forgot that was the most recent thing I copied. The question was what do you recommend as a coinbase alternative?
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:46:05
Thats why you transfer your shit to GDAX. Yes, it's owned by coinbase, but circumvents a lot of the problems.

I know all I need to know. And that is, everyone claims to know the future but nobody actually does.

The exact same thing can be said about metals like gold and silver but people hodl it as a form of investing too.

People who frequent snapchat are the same trend chasing hipsters lat listen to imagine dragons on their $1,100 Iphone X. If there's one thing you can learn from the target audience of that article, its that they don't know anything about anything.

I would have rather seen a screenshot of someone screaming about the bitcoin bubble while the price is only like 1k or something.
