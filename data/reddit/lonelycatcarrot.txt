When people buy a lot. It's very simple.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:40:35
I've already added my coins to the wallet. Is there anyway to test the  passpharase?
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:57:35
Hold it then fees don’t matter

Trezor is Don. open source code too. Nano isn't. god knows what some rogue dev has put in there
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:31:04
People misinterpreted his post. He loves BTC
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:32:25
Buy Trezor 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:39:38
You will regret it 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:31:06
In what sense?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:48:20
Bitcoin will rise to about 14.5K USD.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:55:14
I have btc to invest

Big Whales doing a sell and buy
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:36:55
Good concept, works well, styling is off under iPad Pro however.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:13:22
Don’t worry about the high transaction fees and scalability issues of Bitcoin. That’s what I’ve created Bitcache for. You store your value in Bitcoin and transact lightning fast and cheap via Bitcache. It’s like turning your gold into cash and back into gold, whenever you want.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:27:41
Lovely post
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:55:34
you are another Don who understands.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:20:45
What do you think Is going on here? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:18:42
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:16:48
Thoughts? How could this affect the price? Positive or negative or Whatever?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:54:19
How much did you transfer? and did you set it high priority?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:37:59
TREZOR or nothing 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:40:25
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:43:48
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:39:03
You’re a mug then.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:40:08
How many coins did he sell?
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:59:08
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:21:43
December 18th 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:42:22
That's a great idea. Quite expensive though. Could be worth it.
But then, where do you hide it?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:27:12
Can anyone create a million pound sell ?
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:20:23
Nah, this is for real. If you don’t know who Kim Dot Com is, the guy created megaupload. He’s also a super whale
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:35:18
It’s going to be fine
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:16:22
Sorry to hear about this. I hope you will still have a nice Christmas. Even little things like painting on a Walnut can be a nice present.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:33:57
Care to break down what we are witnessing?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:39:49
Amen bro. There is only so much WhatsAPp whale group coordinated manipulation. Just the same as the November one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:38:29
Of course it does. BTC will be over 50k by May 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:37:21
Can you update us when it arrives?
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:10:01
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:45:21
he should be in prison. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:31:20
How are they achieving this?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:38:21
Dear The Whales.
It is time. Buy 3000 BTC and let us kill BCASH!!! forever!!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:31:18
TREZOR. END. OF.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:00:33
Send me an address and I’ll credit you the btc. We can do a contract by email even you get the coin. Does that work?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:36:54
how do you know that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:22:11
WOW GDAX IS DOWN!
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:13:34
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:34:49
Any confirmations yet?
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:27:33
I’m not a newbie, but you’re right, this must be pre cme jitters.post cme to Saturn right?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:30:15
Why is that?
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:13:21
WE DESTROY THE WALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:39:08
did the guy have lots of feedback?
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:12:26
He had a few. Why didn't you pick someone with hundreds of good feedback? The scam is they do 20 good transactions then fuck the last person over.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:34:28
They maybe lost forever.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:57:03
Hold and get a Trezor. 2020 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:12:48
We scale the wall!
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:40:00
Trezor. No question. The Firmware is open source. Nano S is not. Who could tell if some Dev has put a dodgy line of code in there.
TREZOR. END. OF.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:42:23
You Sir are the don.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:34:43
Give 90% away to charity. Think of the life after death.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:47:42
Great post!
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:17:07
I feel bad for you. Was it all the money you had?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:44:48
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:04:13
You can almost taste the bitterness that seeps out of this 'article'. For someone with two PHD's and sounds like he actually has half a brain, this is an embarrassment to writing.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:00:08
Trezor every time
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:30:04
How is that done?? Or even allowed. Bet it’s roger 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:38:55
How does one go about seeing this HUGE Sell wall at 17.250?
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:20:39
I DONT THINK SO!!!! WE ARE GOING UP MY FRIEND
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:31:10
I pray for you
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:35:48
Do you know if it's possible to sell? I remember reading on the GDAX site that it's opening in 'Post only' mode 9am PST
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:14:17
Have you tried blowing on it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:13:44
LOL, NEVER SELL. EVER
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:11:33
big news
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:11:33
I thought begging was not allowed?
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:20:28
Was this really written 26 weeks ago?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:58:50
how low will we go?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:45:06
Bitcoin cash crew are getting ready for another coordinated weekend attack. Spam mem pool, multi whale pump and dump
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:02:35
Can someone with the knowledge explain to me why Bithumb is down?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:30:11
It sure looks like pure manipulation
I’ve heard there are some bitcoin whales the likes of which no bitcoin cash man has ever considered
Men with 200k bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:09:40
Someone sold their cash at peak.  And the punchline is?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:30:57
Where have they gone?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:28:02
I’m up for it
