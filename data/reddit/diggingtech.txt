Try summoning my ZEC, when it's worth 3 BTC each in 2025

I've been all-in for quite some time, nothing new here, you made a great choice and timed it perfectly!
@_date: 2019-10-10 09:28:00

It is simple, Libra is not going to happen in the first place hah
@_date: 2019-10-11 21:37:29

@_date: 2019-09-19 09:26:50
