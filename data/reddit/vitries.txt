Yes the network does use more energy than some nations however that argument only indicates usage rather than efficiency. My neighborhood uses more energy than some nations because we’re simply larger than some but it’s the type of energy consumed that matters.

If you like to tinker with older hardware, might I suggest getting a older android phone that’s supports lineage OS. My personal wallet setup is that I have an Moto G 2015 flashed with lineage OS w/o G-apps and bitcoin core installed on it from f-droid marketplace. That’s my EDC wallet and keep a minimal amount on it. My larger storage is at home in a Linux box running a full node, then my cold storage is the stamped steel plate from another full node that was ran prior to my newer node. A tad unorthodox but it satisfies my threat levels.

Running a node doesn’t reward you with transaction fees or validation fees; you would need separate mining software in order to collect those rewards. Also because of the difficulty it’s not really worth mining with consumer grade components since most mining is now ASIC miners. It’d be nice if we could got back to the days of mining at home but them days are long gone.

It’s to prevent someone being able to scan the QR code once the paper is folded. I would also HIGHLY suggest not storing any coins on keys produced by online services since they also would have possession of the keys either directly or indirectly. Run a full and if you insist on a paper wallet download a blank pdf and manually write in the keys after printing.

No, no, you’re fine! Yes, running a full node does make a difference in security since it’s connected to the local and wide area networks. I follow the philosophy of “if you don’t own your keys, you don’t own your bitcoin” I run and keep funds on a full node because I want to support the community in keeping a ledger of all the transactions and I don’t want to generate keys from other sources. If you wanted to use Armory on a Linux box at home and only connect it to make transactions you may not need to look into as much of a security setup as running a full node with bitcoin core.

Some people will disagree but in my opinion I’d say that’d be alright. Personally, I’m not in favor of having a paper wallet for long term, cold storage since it can be burned or shredded by accident. I’d get a Trezor and steel stamp for cold storage.

It’s out of convenience and confident. If I don’t spend what I’ve moved to the mobile wallet I can easily move it back or hodl it in cold storage. Also I’m confident that I’ve made all of the necessary changes to prevent a malware attack or compromise to the system to get the keys.

Trezor is a manufacturer of a hardware wallet. Sometimes, because of Murphy’s law, generating keys or the longevity of the product does not go as planned and your get corrupt or unusable keys, worse yet exposed keys, or the circuit components may fail rendering the unit unusable. 
There are pros and cons for every method of wallet out there and which one you use is based off your threat level. The steel dye I was referring to is a piece of steel and you will get number and letter dyes to hammer into that sheet of steel as a means to protect your 20 word/phrase backup.
