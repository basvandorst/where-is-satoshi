Bravo kid! Will support you and hope you will release an Android version.  From experience, I truly believe Android will take half the time.  Being a sole developer and having multiple codebase (iOS and Android) is tough! Gl

Well unfortunately the most complete app I create was for internal company use only for Ford Motor Co..  App that helped checked customers in when their Work laptop broke, created them a ticket number, queue screen, avg wait time and customer satisfaction.   I'll never be able to show that off to the world.
But with my current company, I'm the sole Mobile engineer and I just rolled out our first iteration couple weeks back.  Unfortunately again, this is an enterprise app and is no good to anyone unless your a paid IQS customer.  
IQS Mobile on both iOS and Android.  But if you ever need any advise moving forward, I'd be happy help out with whatever.

Also, it would be nice to add an asset.  Or maybe i'm just a retard.

What exactly would you like me to share?

If you have confidence in your app, there is no need for the guilt trip description for the thread.  Just promote it and let the codebase speak for itself.  If the app sucks, then prepare for negative feedback and downsides.  I don't care what your age is, I just want a functional app that works and fits in my lifestyle. 
On that note, good job.  The app is very UI friendly.  I will give a more formal descriptive feedback after using it for a bit.

Obviously all the Death Stars will have a single point of vulnerability.  Not even worried..
