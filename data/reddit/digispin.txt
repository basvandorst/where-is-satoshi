Yes.  The issue is not with Coinme.  It's the way BTC works (the fee issue has become well-known recently to non-techies).  On top of the normal issue with BTC transaction fees, a wallet that has been used for many transactions (inputs/outputs) will create a larger transaction size (in bytes) which drives up the fees.
By issuing a new wallet, the tx fee was a few dollars.

The problem is that I have a lot to learn :)  Thanks for the replies.

I sent a PM. The ATM timed out after I inserted my cash. It may have reset my password even though I already set that up on your new website.

You're saying the average fee is $24?  I know you don't mean that.  I understand about fees, but couldn't they figure out something close to an actual fee?

I tried to use your machine a week ago and I could log in and select "Buy Bitcoin" but the thing that pulls in the paper money (what do you call that?) wasn't working.  I called the phone number on the flyer where you mentioned the need to withdraw your coins but I just got a generic number out of service.  I assumed the kiosk was there to let people cash out their coins and then was going to be taken away.
I did just now go to your website coinmewallet and I was in your system.  So I assume the next time I go there I'll be able to buy.

Thanks, I t got a hold of tech support and they said they issued me a new wallet:
"estimated network fees: 0.0023025 BTC $10.70"  (used to be $24)
