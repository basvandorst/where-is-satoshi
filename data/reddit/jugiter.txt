Very negative piece - the comments support the "bitcoin promotes criminal activity and has no legitimate use" meme.
Please link the other post - I could not find it and would like to be part of that discussion if there is one.

Take a look at XDN (digitalnote.org). Encrypted messaging built into the Blockchain. Messaging is part of the gui wallet.

interesting, that is not mentioned here either  (that I saw).
i edited the config file to txindex=1. core is reindexing the blockchain as I type

It wasn't that bad. I figured it out but needs to be more intuitive next time.

The article is conflating cash tipping used in the food services industry with digital tipping. Cash tipping serves the employer (ha ha) by subsidizing low wages.  Bitcoin tipping is a way to pay for  digital content independent of advertisers. 
Digital tipping  allows independent content creators (comments all the way to journalists and artists) to be paid by those that consume and appreciate. It can allow more creative and independent content since it is not driven by the current need for click count. If click count is the only thing valued, the content stoops to that.

I am hoping this is what happened so there is a chance it can be brute forced. Unfortunately, I may have make a copy paste mistake. In that case it can not be recovered. 
I just find it odd that I would do that twice to two wallets.

A screen grab from here  showing my old core version was also set to receive connections.

Thanks. No virus my software can find. I have been thinking about a blockchain.info wallet.
I'll try that next. I appreciate any and all ideas.

No, different pass-phrases. They are 20 char randomly generated by LastPass. I tried 500 iterations of each with expected typos manually. Brute forcing is possible I have been told if you start with the expected passphrase.
I am suspicious it is something other than a mistype.  I am wondering why would I have this problem on both of my offline wallets I created the same day and not any of my encrypted on-line wallets?

I wish the tutorial I followed had a step for printing private keys. Seems like a good backup to f'ing up the pass-phrase as apparently I did.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:30:32
That's a possibility. Will do some searches. Thanks for helping me think this through.

As a follow up I was able to discover the actual passphrase by using the ruby script from this thread  
Much thanks to all who helped. It was a stressful and frustrating experience - from which I learned a lot. :)

At the time I created the offline wallets I did not understand about private keys and did not print them.
I am assuming I can not retrieve the private keys now without the passphrase. Correct?
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:18:07
I think I figured out I may have done.
1) encrypted wallet
2) copy wallet.dat
3) change passphrase
4) did not make new copy of wallet.dat
First encrypted copy would not decrypt with the new passphrase. Unfortunately, at that time I would not have grasped the consequence of resetting the passkey (ie re-encrypting the wallet.dat) and not creating a new backup of wallet.dat. 
Live and learn.
