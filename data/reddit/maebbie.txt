what use does it have to remove them from a chart site. If owners of chart websites would obliged to removing mtgox it would be close to censoring.
I liked when it stopped becoming the default choice on bitcoinity, although the mtgox chart still has its relevance.
Every day I wake up and check their chart I am happy and think "haha finally".

I trust btc-e a lot. It is not about having some legal documents, but the reputation. A good reputation is the most important thing for any kind of trader. Since you can store coins in your own wallet anyway you can move them out anyway.

I believe that there will be many crypto currencies for different uses in the future. You can see it today already. Litecoin, for people who do not liek the attention bitcoin is getting. Namecoin which is theoretically for purchasing domains, due to its extra functionality.
Whoever is running exchanges of a wide range of different crypto currencies, will make a lot of money.
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:08:24
the idea is to make a bit profit during the day and sell for a bit higher. You would still need to buy in higher if unlucky.
@_date: 2013-07-14 16:54:40

well sepa transfer, for europeans. International transfers are working too i think, but cost a fee.
Just sign up with some random name and take a look yourself. You can change everything later if you want to use it. You only need verification to deposit and if you do a small deposit it might not be necessary.

@_date: 2013-03-30 16:58:30
COMIC SANS!
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:59:38
1. buy buy buy
2. mtgox lags
3. panic
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:18:05
let's do this. But now need to sleep first.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:54:12
how can i mine dollars?
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:03:39
just panic hold, until the widespread adoption of Bitcoin. Oh, don't forget to cash out your initial investment.
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:49:34
damn, I tried. Seemed so easy.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:18:36
i dunno lol
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:49:22
what means not significant? I think even 10 percent can make a difference.
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:08:48
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:06:42
If it will not crash before 1000 dollar, I will never sell mine. I think when 1000 is broken it has the respect to be accepted by bigger merchants.
@_date: 2013-10-06 12:20:25
epic troll XD
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:31:23
that is because it is person to person trading. And bitcoin.de takes a day to do a trade. I did my first trades on Bitcoin.de and was satisfied, but it is no real exchange where you can trade instantly.
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:47:53
NSA-Coin would be fun
@_date: 2013-05-27 22:30:46
i have like 250k of them, i will take 5 then.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:48:24
what is the site called?
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:07:23
being passive aggressive is bad for your health. I used to do that friendly shit, too.
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:39:23
it still kind of sounds like a pyramid sheme and at the end viral marketing is exactly that. But it is not like you promise them something.
I never saw someone saying "yo dude check out Bitcoin, if you buy now you will double your money in a week". Besides that chatbox on btc-e that is.
@_date: 2013-06-18 02:57:11
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:31:14
What I also worry about is the spread of 10 to 20% between exchanges. Something tells me it will take a few more years before Bitcoin usage will be widespread.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:09:01
same old shit
@_date: 2013-10-04 22:37:33
there is that one rule, since i learned about it i always think "no" and move on without reading.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:19:30
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:24:23
Compared to the last major crash, there is a lot of media attention. And many merchants are starting to accept Bitcoin, because of that Inflation.
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:41:59
just cause.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:22:45
let's do a @_date: 2013-04-07 15:47:42
what?, that gold thing is just a bubble, it will pop soon.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:12:53
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:06:19
Story of the people who held.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:45:14
no plz not satoshis, that word is so stupid it hurts
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:44:10
damn right, 3 backups, 2 medias, 1 out of the house.
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:46:26
do all that after you invested.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:45:46
do you honestly think, the people waiting in the queue decide to no buy bitcoins afterall? There is so much media attention at the moment and the media is reporting about Bitcoin more and more.
@_date: 2013-08-07 21:41:45
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:25:10
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:06:28
it never falls, always buybuybuy.
j/k. It is good to buy some after a flash crash, that bubble is gonna burst as soon as the mainstream is fully aware of Bitcoin and that is Months or even a year ahead.
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:13:47
go to bistamp, verfication was done in like an hour after they requested it.
@_date: 2013-05-27 02:22:59
yeah they should take devcoins, lol
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:34:27


lol, isen't that the same
@_date: 2013-07-20 01:05:23
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:10:26
lol, that analogy. But yeah, wait for the mainstream to get in fully.
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:07:59
sounds more like deflationary spiral for me.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:42:07
wow many tip
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:36:39
that is the pussy strategy btw. I took my profit when my coins hit 15 times the investment. Before that it was too expensive.
Dunno, just cash out when you made 10 times your investment and then keep the rest for the day Bitcoins are widely accepted.
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:23:45
Heil Hitler.

Please remove that stupid alien.

Thank you based Colas
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:46:59
I lost 1000 bitcoins, because of you.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:20:35
i would have kept 90%, never understood why someone would donate 1 year worth of paying for living expenses. Good for SO though.
@_date: 2013-03-22 15:26:07
buy him a wallet with physical bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:10:29
Please remove that shitty lien from the Logo. Why does every subreddit have to include that shitty alien?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:53:49
It's fuck
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:23:39
rofl, you won.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:55:25
noob down
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:59:56
they will consider it once the price breaks 500. You cannot ignore Bitcoin for much longer.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:19:04
many worth
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:53:43
"bat coin" is a new cryptocurrency by Bruce Wayne.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:09:50
litecoin is here to stay, welcome to the future.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:17:48
I see, so all adresses with the fraction of the shown one are not found? How do you search addresses?
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:24:00
propably the ones with tons of bitcoins. But that is good, that way bitcoin will be spread among more people instead of one holding a lot.
@_date: 2013-10-25 14:11:11
he should turn around, take a picture of you and complain about a bad joke you made. Then post it on twitter to get you exmatriculated.
@_date: 2013-06-23 13:33:55
it still sucks though.
@_date: 2013-10-27 15:28:17
how about kyle creates another cryptocurrency, which will succeed over cartmans bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:24:07

@_date: 2013-04-10 01:10:51
I only post here to influence the market. My post will drive up the price for another dollar for sure.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:21:21
"What is that B?"
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:44:04

Panic Hold
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:11:49
dont forget the time it was at 200+ before and crashed.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:59:19
not before 2000. look at the trends, subredditsubscriptions and mtgox queue
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:00:43
oh man, i guess it is time to sell now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:06:37

you win until you loose.
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:01:59
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:11:35
1. buy
2. panic hold
@_date: 2013-06-23 10:37:32
It is a different story, if parents pay for your expenses and your start "investing" your spare money. Sure it is nice when you make profit, but if you loose you also waste money you could only save, because your parents pay for your expenses.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:56:43
Maybe he changed something in this Worldline, which resulted in that breakout to 100.
Another possibility is, that the time traveler mixes true and false predictions in order to raise less attention. A technique John Titor used in 2000s of this Worldline.
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:25:52
Nice use of Bitcointip :). Makes you thank the person who developed the bot, doesn't it?
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:48:59
haha bitcoiners are mad about ltc again. just wait for it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:17:22
maybe that day you will be happy to not have recovered it now.
@_date: 2013-09-14 21:40:04
then you take out your cash, the other person grabs it and runs.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:23:59
yep 1000 in a few weeks for sure. I am skeptical about 10000, but I never thought of 1000 a few weeks ago as well. I guess the only data, would be google trend graphs and the general media attention.
@_date: 2013-09-22 12:21:45
have fun with feminists complaining haha
