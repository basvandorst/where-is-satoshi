No comma after "No" and no end punctuation, just to use your last reply as an example; in this one, no comma after "school."  It really explains the paper.

This, a lot.  For anyone not familiar, isn't even that it is bad for non-porn searches.  It simply doesn't know what non-porn searches are.  Bing is if a browser were rule 34 incarnate.

And if they are telling the truth, refuting it should be no problem.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.

He never said there was anything special, he was saying you're trying to be an internet tough guy and impress people with your weirdness, and you're the one who seems to think you're special.  Everyone knows someone who would fuck someone up for money and/or free.  It doesn't help finding the person or getting the coins back.

A better analogy would be to say that some people pretend to be homeless to get free money. However, while the majority of people who appear to be homeless really are, the majority of people who claim to be new and want to know how this dang changetip think works and isn't bitcoin great because the government can't control it and other pandering statements somehow take everyone in.  In any case, I feel the same about giving money to the homeless after having been homeless myself for some time. If you just want to get out of homeless, there are resources. If you are interested in bitcoin, there are resources. Panhandling in either case is low.

A student once said "all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing." Telling people to just walk on by when they smell something fishy is tantamount to saying "might as well let people get away with it." Individual tips are so small that simply withholding your own is not enough; you need to speak up and make sure others aren't suckered when you suspect a scam. If a person is legit and not just trying to get free money, then they won't be bothered by people claiming they are scanners. For instance, in a recent thread mocking cyanidemadness, someone received tips and said "I don't want these" and actually tipped them back to the community (whereas most scammers will claim not to want money but then not return it when they get it, usuLly saying they'll give it to charity or their kid.)
Being savvy to a scam and not speaking up is being a huge dick to the entire community, whereas speaking up us only being a dick to the person who deserves it.

Because one person can make a bunch of scammy accounts and collect a dozen "little" tips, which adds up to a lot. All scams are bad not just for the money they sucker out of people, but also because it makes the community less likely to support people who actually need or deserve help.

I'm not talking about speculative trading, I'm talking about a longterm investment.  The price of bitcoin is up 200% from 18 months ago, and over 2000% from 24 months ago.  I think the spike in the last year was just following all of the mainstream adoption, not an indication of a bubble bursting.

I couldn't remember who the voice actress was.
