I don't laugh at people when they are unlucky.
I laugh at people when they are told 1,000,000,000,000,000 times NOT to leave money in an exchange or a place where you DON'T control the private keys, and people KEEP DOING IT. At this point, it's like watching idiot lemmings walk off a cliff.
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:38:40
Being homeless isn't a choice in many, many cases.
But CHOOSING to leave money in an exchange WITHOUT the control of private keys is 100% your choice.
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:08:46
Why? Because I think freedom means accountability?
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:49:25
Of course. Again, they had direct control. Ample warning. More than ample warning. At what point do we keep feeling sorry for people who refuse to listen?
Look, I won't laugh if they clearly have some kind of mental disadvantage but I don't think if that were the case, they would even be able to sign up for bitfinex and use it at all.
These are people smart enough to figure that out, yet REFUSE to listen. I feel like at this point, they are just being blinded by greed and laziness.
If they LOST their private key or did some technically challenging thing and made a mistake, I wouldn't laugh. That's a usability problem. Not everything is easy. But KNOWING that you - and only you - have the PRIVATE key, is certainly do-able. Especially for people who are trying to use a cryptocurrency where the PRIVATE vs PUBLIC key is kind of the whole thing it's based on.

WHY did you leave so much coin on an exchange? Have you never heard of MtGox?
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:55:30
I mean what's wrong with starting to give people accountability for the security of their coins, instead of feeling sorry for them or trying to bail them out every time?
It's only a matter of time before sympathy becomes a bail-out.
It's time to become anti-fragile as a community of cryptocurrency users.
I don't want people to lose their bitcoins anymore.
And being nice and sending out PSAs repeatedly isn't working.
I think we have to let things fail, and fail hard. And keep failing hard, until the community of users are hardened.
Way to wishy-washy on security.

Exchanges are also vulnerable to immoral or unjust government intervention. We've seen this with Coinbase and the summons which attacks users of nascent Bitcoin unfairly while things like the Panama and billions laundered by Banks go completely ignored.
Anti regulation is where Bitcoin shines, not for malicious people to commit crimes but to exercise your right to financial privacy and security.
I encourage people to think twice about creating chains of tainted coins. Once there is a physical link, you give away one of the strengths of Bitcoin as a weapon against financial corruption.

Good job. Are you also tracking your transactions? Do you make everyday purchases with your coins?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:49:40
If you spent the time to become educated on the matter, you would understand that pretty much all well-decentralized cryptocurrencies suffer from high fees and a slow network once they've achieved such a high amount of demand and usage.
Of course, if you take a coin that nobody uses, it can have low fees.
But my point is, we don't really have to debate. We both can speak with our money, and the winner will be known long-term. People like you are really the point of the post: worth ignoring!

@_date: 2017-12-02 03:32:47
The biggest problem I see is that we don't have mature anonymization. That means when you use your bitcoins, the way it's designed today, it's possible that an agent requires you to have traceable coins that originate from coins associated with a person's name and address.
This means that you could get potentially excluded from the system for trying to keep your money anonymous.
Since coinbase is handing over details to the IRS, it's a matter of time before there's a huge database that links addresses to real people. And that is a serious problem.
I hope that LN helps with this. But it's my biggest worry that Bitcoin becomes the AOL of the internet. Highly supervised. And privacy invasive.

This is hardly a failure point. In fact, any country NOT accepting cryptocurrency for taxes is basically saying, "we'll accept this worthless depreciating asset called Dollars/Euros/etc. that we invented instead of real money (Crypto)". And people with crypto will HAPPILY convert their crypto to the depreciating asset to hand over to the tax collectors.
A country that accepts their worthless tokens/shitcoins instead of real money is just screwing themselves. And cryptocurrency holders don't have to care about that problem at all.

Bitcoin was born from resistance.
Now, sure, people want to make it legitimate, taxed properly, and surely that will make it more widespread. But what's the point of it growing, if it loses it's soul?
There is a kind of irony in talking about "following the rules" when buying into a system designed to "break all the rules" (or at least test all of it's boundaries to the extreme).
Because if you are talking about using Bitcoin legitimately, you could at least explain that this advice is meant for people who don't care at all about WHY Bitcoin has any value.

If anyone, other than you, has access to the box, then it's not a safe deposit box at all. That being said, you can improve the security a bit by distributing the seed.
Divide your seed words into 3 chunks (A, B, and C). Have 3 safe deposit boxes in 3 separate geographic locations. In each location would have 2 of the three chunks: AB, BC, and AC.
Even if one location, someone opens the box and looks at it they would be missing the other chunk of the seed.
The reason for doing this in 3 places is that you can re-construct the seed if one of the 3 places gets burned down, by collecting the whole seed from the other two places.
Of course, knowing 66% of the seed phrase makes it easier to brute force. So you might choose to use a 2-of-3 multi-signature wallet. That will be far more secure, especially if you're storing a serious amount of funds.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:18:59
Tax collection should be changed to be usage-based fees and tolls. That way, there is no honesty needed. If you use a road, you need to pay a toll. If the military needs money, the government can sell bonds. And with more people saving their own money, there just needs to be sufficient education around saving for a rainy day or private health insurance.
Also, there may be decentralized smart-contract health insurance in the future.
With zero operating costs, such a system would be practically free of corruption and profiteering. A decentralized health insurance plan would basically have contracts where you pay an amount that is calculated to be feasible to support the level of expected payouts on claims, and when medical services are rendered, hospitals would verify usage and close the smart contract for that person.
In other words, we're only at the tip of the iceberg and the world  of how we buy and sell goods and what a "company" even means will be changing. Imagine a world full of autonomous corporations that serve nobody, and we're free to enjoy our lives without being enslaved by our governments.

Nobody needs to "earn a right" to invest in anything. Bitcoin proves itself by ensuring that it maintains it's value by collecting a foundation of people who believe in decentralization and deflationary (in the future) money. All the price noise above this foundation is meaningless in my mind. It's like customers racing in and out of a store without buying anything. It just makes the store look more busy than it actually is. The real store's business comes from people who stay and buy stuff. The rest is noise.

Don't confuse being law abiding with being law touting.
There's no need to break the law, but there's no reason to show support for immoral or unjust laws in the form of repeating them to everyone over and over.
This is what makes posts like these seem like they were written by the government or mindless bootlicking robots.
If you want to follow the tax laws, go ahead. But if something is immoral, even if it was the law, don't be surprised when people start looking at you like one of Hitler's henchmen.

There was a time a few years ago when being subservient to a king or dictator was normal, and everyone who wanted to change that was told "that's the way things are, we're way past freedom".
But not everyone was satisfied with that. And revolutions happened.
Bitcoin is a tool for the privacy revolution. It's not perfect (yet) but it certainly helps against Visa, Google/Apple Pay, and PayPal REFUSING to even take your business because of something they don't like, or the government confiscating all the money in your bank because of something they don't like. 
Bitcoin prevents all of that BECAUSE of anonymity. 
Bitcoin doesn't force you to associate your name or heritage or credit history or criminal history to your bitcoin (unless you accidentally reveal it).
And that's the power of the anonymity of decentralization. No central power putting the pieces together and denying you your freedom to make transactions.
So why do we care? Because we don't think it's anyone's business what we're transacting, especially if their goal is to prevent or deny a transaction because they don't feel like it meets their criteria of a "good" transaction or a "good" person.

I think you're missing what value Bitcoin actually brings to the table. Bitcoin wasn't invented to make you rich or to transfer money cheaply to save you money.
Although it isn't written directly into the code or mathematics, it's mechanics and structure as described in the white paper speak louder than words. That is, what is implied cannot be understated.
Bitcoin's unique property comes from decentralization. You've heard that before, but why do we care about such a thing? Because we've seen what centralization does. The abuse of power that comes from centralization is documented throughout history. And it hasn't been stopped by democratic government. Net neutrality? Trashed. Temporary "Patriot Act" to infringe on all your constitutional rights in the name of security? Yeah, that's permanent. Big bank bailouts? Sure. National ID (Papers)? Coming soon.
So how does Bitcoin fit into solving this? It's really three ways in my mind:
1. By stopping the government from being able to print/create infinite amounts of dollars and thus creating an insidious and immoral tax on your savings in order to fund endless wars and unjustified/illegal abuses of money and power around the world.
2. A brilliant seed of intellectualism that can begin to spread into the rest of the world that desperately needs it. That is, a system of mathematical certainty (in the form of cryptography) to back economic principles guided by logic and non-aggression rather than political motivations. This has the potential to undo the damage done by "every stupid voter's voice still counts". In Bitcoin, everything is a meritocracy. There are consequences to stupidity on many levels. From rash/buggy/incorrect decision-making on the protocol level to the rash/idiotic decision-making in terms of over-investing or buying/selling improperly. This system has the potential to start educating people, brilliantly disguised as a get-rich scheme. We've learned in 2017 that attacks like BCash and Miner's Voice are not significant. And those who thought incorrectly were burned. We witness attempts to attack Bitcoin on many fronts, with the conjuring of conspiracy theories and non-intellectual discussions which is resisted by those who can make better intellectual decisions. Propaganda systems are actually weak against Bitcoin, because mathematical truth cuts through the noise like butane flames through butter.
3. Redistribution of wealth which will free many minds from government slavery. Imagine what would happen if massive numbers of people who owned Bitcoin grew large, and those people no longer needed to work? Some would retire, live a life of luxury, or whatever their "affluenza" disease makes them do. But those people are pretty much lottery ticket winners. These are pure speculative investors, and they don't control Bitcoin or will be part of creating a new future. Then there are those who save their wealth in Bitcoin (notice, I didn't say invest). These people believe that the government has gone too far, it's destroying the planet and humanitarianism of civilized people. When you take people with such a mindset, and empower them with the ability to quit their meaningless job and start to poke and prod at government, this is a huge and healthy threat to government. What happens when 10%, 20%, 50% of the population simply doesn't have to work as much because the value of Bitcoin can sustain them? Well, the government will likely step in before their own currency implodes with rules attempting to ban Bitcoin or even taxing Bitcoin at 50% or emergency Bitcoin tax at 90% in order to "save the economy". And these people, who don't have to work, will have plenty of time to counter the government in all directions - legal, political, and in extreme cases physical.
Will there be a 2nd American Revolution? I don't know for sure. 
But what Bitcoin has planted here, is an opportunity for non-aggression principles to spread to rid the disease of corrupt governments, endless war, environmental destruction, extreme poverty, global inequalities, anti-intellectualism (in turn creating stupid voters), immoral greed and capitalist problems, and finally take a step towards peace.
So if you're feeling uneasy about Bitcoin, you're probably still in it for the quick gains. Which is fine, and I hope you do make a lot of money. If you do, spend the new free time you have to learn about the bigger implications. But if you're in Bitcoin for these reasons that I described above, the price doesn't matter, "HODL" never-ever needs to be repeated, and it is almost unconscionable to perpetuate earth's destruction by doing otherwise.
I'm uneasy about everything happening in the world today. But I'm not uneasy with Bitcoin.

There's no reason to dump all BTC for fiat money.
If I had thousands of bitcoin, I would just hold it and spend on bare minimum necessities.
And if I had any fiat money, I'd spend that first. Or just use it to buy more bitcoin.
Bitcoin is real money in my mind. Everything else is a shitcoin.

I think the message should be:
"If you knew Bitcoin would go down by 10% in value every year for the next 100 years. Would you still buy?"
If they answer "no" then they are not ready.
If they answer "yes" then they are crazy.
If they ask "why" they are ready to learn about Bitcoin and what value is brings to the table that has absolutely nothing to do with it's price.

If you care about new tax laws, I personally don't think you should be invested in Bitcoin. The second you buy Bitcoin, you're painting a target on your back to the government saying, "HERE I AM TRYING TO DESTROY THE DOLLAR".
Now, if you're prepared to respond to that, great! Welcome to the crypto currency revolution!
If you're not, and you don't know how to adequately protect yourself from audit, then you're putting yourself at way more risk than I could ever advise anyone.
You're treading into dangerous waters, because the government hates Bitcoin (and if it seems like they don't yet, it's because they are still confused about it).
I suggest putting $500 USD in some no-load mutual funds instead.

Moon is not defined by market price for me.
How do you define "hard fork of bitcoin will succeed"? If this hard fork is created by Apple or PayPal, and everyone starts using it, and it's completely centralized, do you define it as success? By all financial measures, it would be. But that is HARDLY a success in MY mind.
Because what makes Bitcoin a success to me, is the fact that it continues to exist while being decentralized. It would be an even greater success, if it is widely adopted and the price is higher, but that's not a requirement at all. Too many people are out there with the goal of global domination or becoming filthy rich. I don't understand this unnecessary pull of power.
Bitcoin is successful when it acts as a safe haven from government inflation. By all measures, Bitcoin is very successful in Venezuela in my mind. Does everyone use it there? No. But does it function to protect against stupid and corrupt government regulatory policies? Absolutely.
Go ahead, keep using Paypal or Bcash or whatever other alternative payment system you can come up with. But it's not Bitcoin if it no longer makes any sense to me.
I have no interest in discussing the success of Bitcoin with people who merely want to attract every person in the world to it so they can get rich.
And nobody says Bitcoin isn't being constantly improved. But improved properly, with testing, and no stupid and short-sighted changes often proposed by Bcash fools. Bitcoin is technical rigor, and they don't belong.
What does OVERTAKEN even mean in a world where the vast majority of people's finances and currencies exist in a NON-BITCOIN form? Bitcoin was BORN already OVERTAKEN by the existing world of finance.
It slowly but surely grows in acceptance. The establishment will try to slow it down by creating "blockchain" technologies and alternatives like "Google Pay" or "Apple Pay" or "BCash" but all these are just more stupid stuff that conceptually existed BEFORE Bitcoin was ever created. It's more centralized garbage, and there is nothing to OVERTAKE.
Now, could Bitcoin be replaced in popularity by an equally decentralized and equally expert technical team? Maybe! But it still wouldn't be Bitcoin. Bitcoin will still exist, even if not every cent in the financial world gravitates towards it.
I think you need to stop worrying so much about more of the same centralized garbage being spammed everywhere (fiat, Bcash, eth, etc.) and don't lump such garbage in the same space as Bitcoin.
It's like we're in a shuttle headed for the moon, and you're worried that a race car manufacturer will build a new race car that is super fast. It's NOT related! Different destination! I don't care about cars, when I'm heading to the moon.

I think that is your _personal_ interpretation, unless you can provide me with some proof that FACTA doesn't apply.
An IRS agent could easily conclude that since Bitcoin is NOT US-specific and it can be used in multiple foreign governments, that a Bitcoin address is by default foreign, and FACTA would therefore be applied.
And the money transmission also is clearly shown to be that way as well, since Bitcoin is NOT a currency per the IRS. Therefore, several REAL LIFE cases have concluded in state courts that people have used Bitcoin without a license and those people are currently IN JAIL.
So I don't know why you're so sure about this. If you're going the legal route, why be picky and choosy between following only the capital gains rule, and not ALL RULES?

If they have visibility into your bank accounts and statements, they can compare the price at date of "transfer" and see if you moved an equivalent amount of USD into your bank. That would be pretty convincing association that would make it seem like moving the funds is a sale.
If you didn't sell, then your bank accounts should not have any surprise deposits.
Plus, you can prove that you own the private keys for the funds. Which also proves that you didn't sell.

Again, not worried. There are a lot of people like you, accusing Bitcoin users of investing in tulips or bogus conspiracy theories around the massive amount of open, top-notch, decentralized development of Bitcoin. There are people who believe Bitcoin will fail because it has no regulatory body. I clump all these naysayers into the same group of uneducated people.
You can say delusional, but almost the entire cypherpunk universe thought Satoshi was delusional and such a system would never work. Except a few. But over time, education spreads itself. Non-believers get burned. Fundamentals matter, and that means quality of development team matters.
You have to understand, even if Bcash becomes $1,000,000 per coin due to hype and Bitcoin is "still" only $15,000 I don't treat that as a failure in any sense. This is because Bitcoin achieves it's intended purpose as a decentralized store of value, even if it is unpopular. When you think about it, millions of dollars pour into various currencies, stocks, houses, bonds, etc. every day. All alternative "investments" to Bitcoin. But none of that activity means Bitcoin is any worse. It's really not related in my mind.
Bitcoin users have always been an exception to the rule in the world of establishment systems. Bcash wants to be centralized and has support of centralized and regulated banks like Coinbase. This is just more of the same, and worth ignoring.

What part of this is FUD?
There are millions of people who are incorrectly or illegally filing their tax returns every year, but the IRS decides that they want to put an non-proportional amount of time and energy on people specifically in Bitcoin?
There are so many UNRESOLVED questions around money laundering and licensing that can get the average person seriously screwed, and all I'm advocating is that if you're like the person posting and have absolutely no preparation for the implications around this investment, they are GOING TO HAVE A BAD TIME.
If, like the rest of us, they put the time in to understand the legal implications and risks, I think there wouldn't be any problem.
If you're a noob day trader, signing up with Coinbase with your SSN, Address, etc. and you're basically saying to the IRS, "look at me! i'm in Bitcoin, the infamous cryptocurrency used to launder money and buy drugs!" you're drawing extra attention to yourself. Even if YOU and I both agree that Bitcoin is NOT those things primarily, the government agencies can simply FEEL otherwise, and start investigations. Making yourself miserable, even if they find absolutely no wrongdoing.
So I don't think it's FUD to say that you should be aware of what you're doing, and stop messing with Bitcoin blindly, because you can get BURNED big time.
Tax evasion and money laundering is no joke.

Leave the wallet seed in a safe deposit box at a bank, and then make sure access to the box is clearly stated in your will. This also acts as a backup in case your house burns down.
You should also be able to store the seed of a wallet in the safe deposit box, and that you keep a read-only version on your home computer/phone. This means you can send money securely to it, but no funds can be extracted even if a home invasion happens and they steal/hack your devices.

It's a good piece of temporary transition technology.
It has a very "weird" sort of place in Bitcoin, but it's certainly not where we want to be in the end-game. Otherwise, why use Bitcoin at all?
But just like Coinbase itself, which is a stepping-stone company to help with adoption, the Shift card is a stepping-stone product to help ease the transition into a world where we don't need Fiat.
And once we don't need Fiat, because everyone accepts Bitcoin directly, is the same day we don't need Coinbase or a Shift debit card.
But we can't get there in one giant leap, so these stepping-stone products are cool to help a pool of people who want to use Bitcoin a bit more, but at hindered by a lack of full Bitcoin acceptance.
That being said, if merchants say "oh I don't even have to bother adopting Bitcoin because people can get a card" then we'd be slowing them down. But it will take time for merchants to realize that it's much, much better for them to take Bitcoin with no chargebacks, almost no fees, etc. So for now, there's this.

The difference in my mind, is the difference between a good plan for launching a shuttle to land on the moon, from a bad plan for launching a shuttle to land on the moon.
And as a hint, that has nothing to do with speculation. In fact, any speculation or guess-work puts the entire plan at risk.

My point is that you should NEVER be concerned about a fork.
The value in Bitcoin should be based on technical superiority of the technology, goals, and the team behind the coin.
No fork has derailed BTC.
The "market price" of Bitcoin has nothing to do with the actual fundamental value of Bitcoin. Markets move based on a mixture of those who buy Bitcoin because it is technically a superior decentralized currency, and those who buy it because they don't give a damn about the technical details and just want to ride the wave to profits.
Let's say the price is at $10,000. And then a bunch of uneducated people jump in and push the price to $20,000. Does that mean Bitcoin is suddenly technically improved? No. The software is exactly the same. And if those people jump ship foolishly, does that mean Bitcoin is suddenly technically inferior? No. Again, the software has NOT changed.
You have to understand that perhaps economically there is no difference between value and market price.
But in my mind, there's a huge difference. And that is, a fork can pull PRICE down from Bitcoin, but a fork can NEVER pull VALUE down from Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin's capabilities and future are what I really value and the software is a static, defined thing.

Oh yeah, and since we're trying to be compliant. Since undocumented holdings of money may become illegal and cash may become illegal (see recent bills being proposed by congress), simply owning Bitcoin might put you into serious consequences.
And reporting your transactions will reveal that you own Bitcoin, which may become a crime in the near future (depending on if the bills pass and become law).
So, to be safe, don't just report your Bitcoin gains, you should sell all your Bitcoins and be ready to prove that you don't own any Bitcoins at all anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:13:51
Don't forget reporting FBAR and FACTA to the IRS!


Also, don't forget that you are REQUIRED to have a money transmitter license - and there is absolutely NO MINIMUM threshold. If you are transmitting Bitcoins, you are a party in a sequence of transactions. Bitcoin does not work like cash, in that, the record of moving cash is associated to previous movement. While you might personally think spending coins is like spending cash, it is not. You are associating an additional transaction to an existing recorded transaction chain, and this means you become a party to money transmission.
Also, be sure to pick up all of your licenses per state. California license costs $500,000+ or so for money transmission (e.g. surety bonds).
Anyways, good luck being 100% compliant with IRS and FinCEN!

Miners are like minions that get paid by the users in the peer-to-peer network for their hard work in validating the blockchain. You don't need to care about mining, anymore than you care about Visa's credit card database technology.
The users (peers) run independent nodes and listen for new, validated blocks. These nodes are capable of sending and receiving transactions. That's what matters in the end.

There are people who define "success" in terms of getting as rich as possible, as fast as possible. In such terms, there are people who think that a faster more centralized Bcash is going to "win the war". The reality is, Bitcoin isn't even participating in that "war" because the goal of Bitcoin is to remain the best possible decentralized cryptocurrency, not the next Apple Pay.
People need to calm down, and know what they are investing in.

I think it depends on your definition of safe.
Be careful about:
1. Associating your personal information with Coinbase which will likely be shared with authorities - creating a traceable trail connected to your coins. Even if doing 100% legal things, you can be harassed by agents looking to investigate a trail that someone you exchanged who eventually committed a crime. Not to mention get audited by the IRS even if you filed all your paperwork correctly. The hassle of organizing a bunch of tax records from 4 years ago can be a serious pain in the ass.
2. Coinbase can get hacked or find itself without enough coins to pay off balances particularly if the price of Bitcoin drops very rapidly. That means, you probably want to store your coins outside of Coinbase. But only do this once you actually know how to safeguard your coins responsibly on your own.
Are they trustworthy? Seems like it so far, although they have a lot of suspicious connections to the fraudulent Bitcoin.com camp, I haven't yet seen them doing anything outright wrong.
Good luck!

They can just ask you. It's difficult to lie, if you said, "I didn't sell - I transferred them" while at the same time you have a bank statement that is adding that same exact value of those coins into USD into your account shortly thereafter. Very suspicious.

It doesn't need to. By mining the block, they are able to add a transaction to it that sends itself the reward. Nobody else can just copy that, because the hash would be different. Another person could solve that block later, but other miners will already be starting to build upon the earlier one. And so, someone trying to play catch-up on an older block is just going to fall behind and be at a disadvantage. It's best if they just start working from on top of the latest solved block instead.

Does it really count as "costing" when a lot of that electricity is by miners who are looking to the future? I mean, I think we can handle just as many transactions per second if all mining was cut by 95%. I mean, the total hash rate was exponentially lower just 2 years ago. I don't think it's fair to say all the investment-oriented millions of dollars into mining into Bitcoin is what it costs to support it.

How can we get what you just described into some digestible educational format for the average person? Maybe in layers? Basic security? Then more advanced security, such as what types of vulnerabilities are protected by hardware wallets, etc?
Maybe some video tutorials? 
In the end, it seems like quite a massive amount of education. But, imagine how Bitcoin can really start exploding if somehow we made this education extremely accessible and do-able for busy people who don't have a lot of time or patience.

Depends on why you are buying.
If it's because you believe the technology is useful and have a use for it now or the near future (as in, making some kind of purchase) or you simply want a place to store some value in a way nobody can confiscate, then yeah, grab a little and see how it goes! I definitely encourage you.
However, if it's because you want to make more money by selling it later at a higher price, I would advise you to invest in Apple or Google instead. These places actually have a goal of making investors more money. Bitcoin's goal is not to make investors rich, at least, in my opinion. You'd be throwing your money away, and you'd be relying on "future suckers" and I don't want Bitcoin to be like that. It's too important a technology to be all about the price.

How do I make sure my information is secure? I generally assume everyone can see what I'm doing - Google can read all my emails, browser cookies are sending a list of all the sites I'm visiting to some shady marketing group, my ISP sees pretty much *everything* I transmit over the network - hell, seems like they could just swap the address I'm trying to send money to in-flight over the network. Even as someone who's been using computers for decades, I see vulnerabilities *everywhere* and I can only imagine how insanely complicated it would feel for a layman to try to secure their information. How secure is WiFi anyways? What if you're using a public access point with a compromised DNS server that is rerouting your traffic to a "pseudo Bitcoin node" to handle your "transaction" while rewriting it to pay to their own wallet instead. I'm guessing it's not possible... or is it? If not, why not? 
So there's just a lot of questions. And it's not to say Bitcoin isn't secure. It's more to say, what will it take to be able to explain how Bitcoin is secure when done right, and how to do it right.

I always wondered about how mixing could be anonymous.
If I had one wallet with public addresses A and B, with coins in A, and sent them to a mixer which pushed them into intermediary addresses C, D, E, F and I wanted the coins back in my control, they could go into address B. However, as soon as I spend something that combines A and B, it can all be traced in a way such that there is a loop. And it seems like the mixing effort would fail. It seems like no matter how much you "mix" things, there will always be a trail, and if that trail re-connects with your original wallet for spending on an item that is larger than one address, people can see that it went through this loop.
Is this accurate?

Bitcoin without this ideology is a worthless technology, because then it already exists. Not only that, but it's widespread. We already have a corrupt system, so why bother building another corrupt one?
I say Bitcoin is 100% worth only because of the ideology. I know people are trying to separate Bitcoin from the politics, but I think it must be embraced for Bitcoin to actually have a difference. Bitcoin's ultimate strength is it's potential to drive a more peaceful healthy and free planet, not to save 1-2% when you buy a pair of shoes online.

It's not just supply and demand.
If I privately owned 1 million shares of my own company, which had a valuation of $1 million at current profit, revenue, size, etc. then the stock would be $1 per share. Now, without anyone buying any more shares, the company can internally increase it's valuation by generating bigger profits next quarter, putting that profit into more employees, etc. and growing to then have a valuation of $2 million. Now, the stock is $2 per share. And not a single person bought a new share of the stock. It went up, without *requiring* the next person.
Bitcoin doesn't have the same mechanisms of an operating business. It is much more like a commodity or collectible.

There should be another Bitcoin subreddit dedicated to how to evade taxes, FinCEN, and other laws successfully. This is pretty close to a federal ban on Bitcoin as far as I'm concerned, and one of my favorite strengths of Bitcoin is that regardless of "regulation" imposed, it has the powerful ability to undermine it (aka, the Freedom aspect of it).
If anyone is in Bitcoin for political and economic reasons, and understands how corrupt the government and Federal Reserve system are, there would be very little interest in then following a bunch of "rules" voluntarily when it cannot be enforced in any reasonable way.
I think Bitcoin has been splitting, and is already been split in terms of political approach. There should be a that we can discuss how to do things without giving in to the exact same corruption led a large number of us to Bitcoin in the first place.

I think the double drop in difficulty is a clear sign that the miner's willingness to mine for new coins is starting to exhaust. It's baked into the balancing formula that if mining grows while the price does not, then either mining needs to slow down (and it didn't at all until nearly the end of the year) or the price needs to rise to follow (which it did not, as the mood was somber and uncertain with the great goxxing of 2014). Continued mining drove down the price even further, making it less profitable to mine. Despite this, we definitely survived a huge hurdle. But like every other "doomsday crash" in the past, Bitcoin survives.
I don't know if we've reached a "miner's bottom" yet. However, I do know that natural market corrections are healthy in Bitcoin (something that the good old Fed doesn't understand). And I have a lot more faith that the price of Bitcoin actually reflects the right balance of current value and expectations for future value because it isn't regulated. And just like high stock prices trading at 10X or 15X EPS (i.e., price at a future EPS), the outlook of Bitcoin is also baked into the price at any given time.
Will it rise even further? Maybe. But that will depend on an _unexpected_ increase in adoption. I think people holding on to their bitcoin along with whatever blend of expected price increases they have in mind will average out to something close to where bitcoin might go. And as long as excessive hype or excessive panic does not hit, the price should follow adoption slowly. Mining is also stabilizing, as it's become very hard to be a single major player influencing the total hash rate.
The reality is that while we may have more individuals using bitcoin, more places to spend it, more ways to use it, all these wallets don't add up to a lot of coins in comparison to 1) total goxxed coins, 2) total institutional coins (grabbed by US govt auctions). We're talking many millions of dollars just right there. Even an influx of another 100,000 people getting bitcoin wallet and putting $10 on it for each of them doesn't add up to the massive buys or lost coins. Which means to me that we're in such a young phase, and we have a long time before adoption will really begin to start to have an effect on the price. I don't think the average person is trying out bitcoin with $1000's. They will put in a few bucks just to try it. Also, people don't have a ton of money in general to put into bitcoin. The whole 99% thing means a lot of people are living paycheck-to-paycheck and basically very poor.
By the end of 2015, I'm looking for a stable price similar to the current price now +/- 15%. This would be an ideal because a stable price means more people can trust keeping their money in it, and also it means that we're avoiding ridiculous hype cycles which only make it difficult to use as an everyday currency. I'm hoping for the end of hype, and just a comfortable, natural growth curve that matches the difficulty line plus the natural difference in the inflationary currency practices and it's global effect on commodity values such as gold and bitcoin. Any kind of fiat currency crisis would throw this projection off, but I don't think the majority of bitcoiners are targeting such a thing happening in 2015. It's hard to predict such things. As much as I do think the Fed is destroying the dollar (and other countries gov't doing the same to their currencies), it seems like it will be more of the same gradually destruction that has been going on for the last century. Which is fine by me, since I'm protecting my money in non-fiat storage (gold, silver, real-estate, and bitcoin).
Have we reached the bottom of the price? Perhaps, but only because it seems like mining has had it's first bit of corrections in a long time plus the timing of it seems to reflect the idea that the slower, less efficient miners need to re-balance their sheets (cash out on profits and shut down operations). Until now, many of these may have been mining at a marginal loss (sunk-cost mining) creating an imbalance. I think the end of the year is where we'll see the tail end of the pressure for mining. If we're balanced again now, then I see no reason for the price to fall due to mining anymore. At least, not until closer to the end of the 2015 when miners will again reflect on and cash out as appropriate. Not to mention people who are cashing out gains and losses for tax purposes which can have an effect on price.
Here's to a stable 2015! Cheers.

That's circular reasoning. 
The savings dramatically rising and falling is being caused by people NOT using it as a long-term store of substantial savings.

Instead, it's being speculated to all hell. And makes it a HORRIBLE vehicle for long-term savings.

The way we use technology is key. We used email for good things. We didn't spam it much, particularly if we liked email and what it could do.
I hope that we don't spam Bitcoin with speculation of it's units, particularly if we like Bitcoin and what it could do.

Yes, you are right. But I'd say it's not a close, direct relationship with the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. Perhaps a relationship with transaction growth (frequency + size). But if someone starts a new Bitcoin business, and nobody knows about it, the price doesn't automatically increase. Someone has to buy more.
With a stock, even if nobody bought 1 more unit, the value of a stock does increase as it represents a "share" of a company which may become larger simply because of increased company revenues/profits. It doesn't really require the next person to buy more stock for the price to go up. Though it does happen a lot with stocks as well, if not the majority of the reason for price increases.

I don't think we really need to ban banks.
We just need to make them play with fair rules.
Having them use Bitcoin will mean that they can't create money out of thin air.
And if there were also reasonable rules about fractional reserve banking, things would be better as well.
But even if there were no rules, banks that are too risky with their reserves will naturally default from any sort of bank run. And when that happens, again, they wouldn't be able to magically bail-out the banks on Bitcoin. At the very least, a bunch of political hand-forcing would happen and a direct tax on the people would have to be applied. And that might, at the very least, wake up some people.
Instead of the usual, sneaky inflation that the government loves to inflict on the virtual currency (I'm speaking fiat).
We have to get the cheaters out of the system.
Abuse of power is a story repeated in all of human history.
Diligence and the power of an idea is what we need to restore balance and end the suffering.

* Bitcoin has no CEO. It is not related to any single company. 
* It's a kind of technology. Email is technology that replaces paper letters, and Bitcoin is technology that replaces paper money. 
* Just like people buy both good things and bad things with cash, there are people who buy good things and bad things with Bitcoin. It doesn't mean cash is bad, or Bitcoin is bad. 
* And since you can instantly transfer money person-to-person with Bitcoin without any bank middlemen, you avoid any nonsense or fees. 
* Therefore, it's money freedom.

This type of experience is exactly what I wanted to avoid by preaching that Bitcoin Price != Bitcoin Success. I am only mocked and ignored. :-(
The power of Bitcoin is it's technology. You win when you gain all the benefits of it. We've unfortunately somehow associated a high price with the success of Bitcoin and to many people the purpose of Bitcoin is as an investment vehicle - a way of getting rich.
That is absurd and I wish that your experience was different here and that you could see there are benefits to having freedom and privacy with your money. That libertarianism is good. But unfortunately, greed is a separate issue.

It's good to remember that it's only scarce because the adopters of this currency (in particular, all the people running the software) agree upon that rule of scarcity.
If, at some point, there was a large consensus to change a rule - that change would either be applied (software would change), or this large group would switch to a different digital currency with different rules.
Luckily, people see that the scarcity is a good thing and have widely adopted Bitcoin as their choice of money more than many competing digital currencies.

What's fascinating about this is that the concept of "clean coins" versus "unclean coins" gets kind of blurry here. Will these coins be worth less than typical value because of it's history and ties to illegal operations? I don't think the government will want to make a distinction anymore, because then they will have auctioned off completely worthless coins. But that in fact legitimizes the completely agnostic view - that every coin is as good as another coin, regardless of history.
The selling of these coins is a legitimization of the currency. It's a great thing.
It would be pure evil if they were to auction it, and then later make it illegal to have coins connected to illegal activity.

Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, my point has not come across if this is a statement you make.
This is the precise statement that I wish that newcomers to Bitcoin would *NOT* adopt and rather embrace Bitcoin as their own. Nobody is responsible for selling you or improving Bitcoin for your sake. It is not you vs Bitcoin, it is your technology. You can do with it what you like. Complaining about it is like painting a picture yourself and then complaining to everyone that the picture isn't good. Nobody is really going to help you there. It's your picture. 
I'm not sure how else to explain it.
There are many people unhappy with the way things are and are seeking an alternative. If you are not that person, then by all means, you don't have to be interested in it. If you aren't convinced after you've looked at everything Bitcoin offers, then fair enough.

* Ridiculous IRS ruling that every bubble gum purchase using Bitcoin needs to be reported as capital gain/loss
* Insane mining hash rate bleeding profitability, particularly when prices are low
* Offloading of coins with increasingly new ways to spend it
* Burned out speculators who bought in at $1000
I think it's no surprise that there is little buy pressure. Although I personally think there is optimism to be had, a LOT of people have been burned mightily by Bitcoin, unfortunately.
Hopefully, time will heal these wounds.

Put $50k into part of the Bitcoin ecosystem - invest in some of the projects that make Bitcoin a better technology for everyone. Bitcoin isn't better when it's worth $10,000 per coin. It's exactly the same except more volatile which I would argue is even worse. :-(

For people in the U.S. and other developed countries, there is almost no reason to use Bitcoin right now.
It's still a growing technology. There are enthusiasts in the field, but it's mostly just a hobby. If the technology or implications don't interest you, then there's no reason for you to use it.
In countries where government currency is failing or there is simply no digital banking option, Bitcoin can really be useful as a matter of their own survival.
It will gain mainstream traction once it's advantages simply clearly outweigh the other options. For example, if every merchant offered a 10% discount when paying for Bitcoin, more and more people will switch.
Today, however, it's still just too new. I don't suggest wasting time with Bitcoin if you are not interested in either the technology or the implications. You won't save money, there are a TON of Bitcoin scams out there, and it's a complex mess to secure properly.
I love it though.

It's an OK documentary from my perspective.
I would have focused less on startups and more on why people really should care about Bitcoin.
I think there is a rising tide of news that consistently shows how the government is out of control with its power and spending.
And in the history of money, there has never been anything like Bitcoin.
I wish it really talked more about the incredible engineering problem it solves. It's not just some "nifty idea" that anyone could say, "I wish I thought of that." because I think there are maybe a few dozen people in the entire world who could have.
The breakthrough is nobel prize winning level spectacular.
I wish it talked more about the fundamental challenges facing Bitcoin in a more abstract term.
What rights do people have of their use of money? How much power should the government really have?
I think there are issues far more important going on, and this documentary only shows some surface-level nonsense going on with MtGox, Tradehill, and other businesses trying to reap profits. And traders trying to reap profits.
I would say there is a tremendous dedicated contingency of people who do not give a damn about the price or how many jobs it creates or how rich someone can get building something related to Bitcoin. There is a core group of people who believe in what Bitcoin means from a much deeper, philosophical point of view.
I think it would help people to really understand the implications of Bitcoin.
Oh well... anyways, nobody cares about my opinion but just wanted to rant.

Dear mattmiller1973/Bloomberg TV,
Please ensure that your news stories make it abundantly clear that the price of Bitcoin is not directly related to the ability of Bitcoin to function.
The greatest story of Bitcoin will always be the disruptive capabilities regardless of it's price. When there is too much focus on price, we invite speculators which in turn cause volatility, which in turn actually makes Bitcoin a little less functional.
We can't change what people will do, but I think we can at least make sure they are properly informed on the difference between Bitcoin the technology and Bitcoin as a unit of cryptocurrency.

First, this assumes all these entities working together to decipher your history. This is not a trivial task.
Second, this assumes that you're not mixing your coins at all.
Third, "your history" is different from the coin history. As coins go from one wallet to another, you as a person may or may not have any relationship or association to those wallets.
There are ways to improve Bitcoin from a privacy perspective, but they are in the process of being addressed.
And it's still so much better in my opinion than *blatantly* handing over all your personal info to companies and banks. And when transacting, way better than handing over a "credit card" which they can use to pull more money than I allow them to. Even with fraud protection, it's an unnecessary risk and the protection comes out of the pockets of others like insurance.
Anyways, the point I was making with the original response was exactly that there are people who complain about things like this and do nothing else. They make no effort to do anything and feel like they are expected to only receive the benefits.
Bitcoin is NOT a corporation. It's something that people need to get involved in for it to be understood and function and grow. People who sit around waiting for it to be perfect like some food critic at a restaurant are simply insulting the food being cooked voluntarily and given voluntarily. And I wish people would first understand that, and bring something more than just criticism. Bring solutions.
There is no central body corporation benefiting from you using Bitcoin, which means that any problem you have with it, should also include some solutions or at least interest in helping yourself by helping Bitcoin.

Because the primary reason Bitcoin grew so fast was due to a massive introduction of "investor"-type people when the hype train was rolling at full force last year in the run up to $1000. Every news agency was covering it and had a story, which perpetuated the run up in price itself. This was (and is) unsustainable.
Eventually, when the growth stopped, the same "investor"-types all started to leave. Some have held on, but ultimately, if they don't see a future higher price, they will leave at a different rate. It all depends on how stubborn they are as an investor. But eventually, if they don't see the price going up, they will all leave.
What the "investor"-types don't understand is that Bitcoin, although designed to combat losses through government inflation and counterfeiting, is that it is meant to be a stable currency. This is stabilized by the demand for coins with demand for mining. Investors HATE stable. They don't make money buying a $600 Bitcoin and selling it 2 years later at $600.
And so, the "investor"-type begins to cause ripples - panic, highs, and lows, mostly unintentionally, by their fear and greed. Volatility comes from them. And they all watch the prices fall, fear further fall, and cause other investors to make the price fall, and so on. Cascading rollercoaster ride.
Eventually, though, many of these "investors" give up. They leave the market place. The market stabilizes again. And normal growth continues at a normal pace again (based on higher adoption, and more people using it for long-term storage rather than investment). But these long-term holders won't jump in until they see a "stable" price.
Which brings me to the 2nd group of people, the mirror image of the "investor". There are "fundamentalists" who actually believe in Bitcoin's technology and usability. These people love what Bitcoin is, regardless of price. Some people think they are idiots, but they are foward-thinkers. They see the future and the benefit to Bitcoin. It's undeniable to them. They are not rocked by the heavy ocean tides. They are almost bulletproof to the degree that they are dissatisfied with the current financial system and world problems.
Ultimately the price will stabilize when the investors all leave and what remains are fundamentalists. And then, we can again begin the slope of steady growth.
Not all the investors have left, so expect more bloodshed here on the price. The only way to prevent it at this point would be an artificial hype bubble perpetuated by the news outlets. But, given the recent memory of the $1000-crash it is unlikely that the hype news would be good anyways. It's much more likely that the hype would only crash it faster if they report on the crash.
Personally, I am OK with "investors" leaving. They don't contribute to Bitcoin as much. They waste everyone's time on the price and this is a time when we still need more focus on the technology rather than the price.
But there will always be investors, the greedy ones. And expect them to cause ripples (or tsunamis) and I simply steer clear of them. I don't jump in when I see a wave coming. Every time I bought into Bitcoin it was when I was sure that a majority of crazy investors have left, and Bitcoin seemed stable again (for several months in a row).

Seems like there are just so many moving parts when it comes to the infrastructure underpinning Bitcoin.
And maybe that's where Bitcoin education needs to begin: in a course in fundamental computer and internet security. Then, secondly, a primer in cryptography. And finally, the Bitcoin protocol itself.
How can we wrap all these topics into an easily digestible form for my grandma who regularly downloads viruses, uncle who knows the basics of email and buying things online, sister who works in fashion/design and doesn't have a really huge interest in "techy" things beyond their utility, etc.?
We know we should pitch the utility value of Bitcoin first, but once they like what they hear about it - the next step of trying to understand how it is safe is quite difficult without a lot of fundamentals.
What can we do to provide the fundamental education to the average user? I mean, is it sufficient to direct them to some Khan Academy course on computer security? Is that overkill? Should we build something more targeted - a course on end-to-end security for Bitcoin users?

Hopefully some people will have lost so much money in this crash that they won't think of Bitcoin as an investment anymore.
Unfortunately, there will be more hype cycles in the future. The best we can do is educate people that speculation only hurts Bitcoin due to the volatility and that buying Bitcoin is *NOT* the same as investing in the future of Bitcoin adoption and technology. And that NOBODY should expect to make a ton of money buying Bitcoin. That's not the point of Bitcoin. If that were, then I'd say Bitcoin was a total scam. But I BELIEVE in Bitcoin as a goddamn ground-breaking awesome technology. I do believe in it. But screw the price rollercoaster.

The problem is that nature does not care about political fairness. In nature, there are some who are unfit to survive. When we try to artificially prop up such people (which is appropriately humanitarian), there are many natural forces which will try to undo what has gone against nature. For example, if people are guaranteed basic income, then people will undoubtedly stop working to produce their fair share.
I am not particularly in favor of harshly letting those who are unable to help themselves die. That is cruel and inhumane. And however we have attempt to "defy nature" with complex political constructs, they undoubtedly become corrupt or loopholes render the system unsustainable.
One of the best mechanisms has been to apply humanitarian sacrifice voluntarily rather than forcefully by political or even technological means. If said humanitarianism is sufficiently important to all people, then there will always be sufficient money being distributed to all (for basic income). If it is not sufficiently important, we simply create 1) resentment among those who do not wish to participate through force, 2) natural forces breaking down and people producing less in the world than they consume - subsequently, running out of resources.
And the best way to achieve humanitarian practices, to provide basic income for all, would be to change the mindset of people - to inspire them to have heart and to give. To teach them empathy, sacrifice, and sympathy.
And it will be shown, through the rise of Bitcoin, that when people's hard-earned Bitcoin isn't destroyed through the corrupt bailouts of rich crook bankers and through unforgivable wars, and people have sufficient wealth for themselves, that those people will give. Perhaps the 1% won't give, but if we had a large Bitcoin middle-class, we wouldn't need anything like basic income because humanitarianism can flourish. Greed has its limits, particularly in a society with an evolved social conscience.

Bitcoin isn't ready for everyone. And it's not a good currency yet.
The person needs to be (at least sufficiently one or more of the following):
* Patient with new, "beta" technologies
* Intelligent (crosses out 80% of people)
* Generally curious about things
* Privacy-minded
* Freedom-minded (wants full ownership of their money)
* Understands media manipulation and propaganda; knows how to separate BS from truth
* Is more than just about saving or profiting a few $$$
There will be a time, someday, when Bitcoin will be much easier to use and will be easy to convince people to use it.
But we have to be really honest with ourselves about the general user who doesn't care about the philosophy or principles behind Bitcoin. When you strip those pieces out, and you try to pitch Bitcoin on % savings on fees alone, it becomes a weak argument.
The volatility and complexity and required payment processor fees make it a very hard sell from a pure apples-to-apples business standpoint. 
It takes a lot of time and effort to learn and understand and properly integrate and secure Bitcoin. All for what? To do something that credit cards already do?
It's not enough to compare Bitcoin by the metrics of the existing payment space, such as fees. Bitcoin's most awesome features have nothing to do with lower fees. It has more to do with the spectacular principles of human rights, privacy, security, sovereignty, property rights, free markets, and honest governance. Visa and Mastercard simple pale in comparison when they go head-to-head against these killer features.
There will be a time when the mainstream will start converting in droves, but now isn't it. When it starts happening, nobody will need to be convinced. They will use it because it's easy and better. Just like the telephone. Just like the internet. Just like e-mail. Just like the web.
Bitcoin still needs to grow more. It hasn't been heard enough by the intellectual community yet. Once it's understood and accepted by the most likely subset of intellectual adopters, I think it will make sense to move to the broad range of intellectual adopters. Then, the mainstream will simply adopt it because they depend on trusted intellectuals to make decisions for them. Trying to pitch directly to the mainstream will not work.
We need more intellectuals. Academics. Professors. Professionals. Doctors. Political scientists. Libertarians. Free market capitalists. Unbanked societies. Desperate 3rd world countries. Government officials. These are the ones that will take Bitcoin from being a geeky tool in a geek's basement to the second stage and provide a real solid foundation for Bitcoin support. Even if we convince some mainstream people to use it, their support will be fragile at best if they use it only because it saves a few dollars on fees. 
The road ahead is tough, but it will happen eventually. I have to believe it will.
However, I applaud your efforts. It is the effort of enthusiasts trying to find the right audience that will help it grow, more so than just sitting around hoping for something to happen. We're learning what works and what doesn't work. The only way to do that is to fail sometimes. I think we have to accept that Bitcoin growth and adoption will be one hell of a tough road, filled with difficulties. But luckily, unlike Bitcoin mining difficulty, I think Bitcoin understanding difficulty will decrease over time.

Maybe they are buying their coins at $301.50, that's fine. But if they are actually being shady, why shouldn't I be annoyed by that?

Why should I not be joyful in that what I have been trying to say for YEARS (even back in 2010) and have been ignored is now clearly biting everyone?
People speculate in Bitcoin because they believe there is some kind of tremendous association between the price of Bitcoin and the success of Bitcoin.
Yes, there is *SOME* association. As Bitcoin is more adopted, there is simply more money in the market cap of standard daily use + typical cold storage and savings. But it's not "the investment opportunity of a lifetime" of course not. It's hopefully simply going to RETAIN it's value long-term.
Apple is an investment. Ford is an investment.
Gold is not an investment. Bitcoin is not an investment.
And I believe if there were fewer speculators and more users, there would be the stability which would increase the public trust.
I do feel bad for people who lose money because they were misinformed about what Bitcoin is. But how bad should I feel about people who are more greedy than are caring about what Bitcoin truly offers as a technology?

If we translate it to today, people wouldn't think it's remarkable to own $10,000 or even $100,000. Maybe $1 million, but even that buys you an ugly house in some prime real estate markets.
So, what is worthy of a whoa? I would say $1 billion. And by the time 1 BTC = $1 billion, Bitcoin will be ubiquitous. 
Given the rising technology adoption speed, comparing with internet adoption, subtracting the much more controversial nature, I think that will happen in 20-25 years. This also aligns with my theory that it only takes one generation to adopt something as the norm.

Dear CNBC, 
Speculative investment into Bitcoin units is not the same as faith in Bitcoin technology. Please don't act like it's the same thing. A falling price may actually indicate that some of the greedier folks are abandoning Bitcoin unit as a vehicle for getting rich, which is something Bitcoin never claimed to do to begin with.
Bitcoin still does many things it intended to do when it was invented very, very well. It allows people to transact globally, cheaply, quickly, without being tied to any 3rd parties. It is still revolutionary, regardless of speculators who may be pumping up or pumping down the price of Bitcoin units.
Bitcoin still has a HUGE future, even if the price of a Bitcoin unit is $0.01. The price is irrelevant, even though there will be some natural correlation to that great future and the price of a unit. But don't assume the reverse is true. A poor price of the unit does not mean it does not have a great future or that it isn't working.
@_date: 2014-10-06 08:56:27
100% agreed with you.
I'm just saying that it's not the high price that allows Bitcoin to be used widely. It's that when it's used widely, it will come with a high price. And that's the *kind* of high price that would be such a great success. Not a hyped-up version of speculative cash that artificially pumps up the price of Bitcoin, only to have the bottom drop out when someone gets panicked.
I want confidence in Bitcoin, but I hope it grows through real usage-based adoption and not speculation.
I hope you see that this is in agreement with everything you're saying, just a matter of how to get to that point.
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:33:45

I think people are unfortunately misinformed when being taught about Bitcoin for the first time.
Somehow, too many people are getting into the idea that the success of Bitcoin depends on "new suckers" buying Bitcoin and pumping the price of Bitcoin "to the moon". If that's all Bitcoin is, then hell yes, it's a scam. It's a horrible, nasty scam that I wouldn't be a part of.
However, I don't believe that's what Bitcoin ACTUALLY is. People are using it in a scam-like manner when they hype it up so people buy it like some investment vehicle. But the actual awesomeness of Bitcoin is it's utility. It's ability to transfer quickly cheaply globally. It's amazing. And it keeps the power in your hands. Nobody can control your money but you.
Unfortunately, so many people are getting sucked into Bitcoin's price nonsense. There might be a "correction" going on with miners who have overextended themselves. But that's going to be a normal part of the marketplace. And an educational experience for people who invested in mining. They hopefully learned their expensive lessons.

You cannot "invest" in unit Bitcoin anymore than "invest" in any country's currency. Dumping loads of money into Bitcoin is fine, but Bitcoin isn't designed to earn you a return on it's units. It will not pay out a dividend or even interest. Unlike a company, it is not a business that is trying to earn a profit and thus grow more value for shareholders. The only way you make money when buying Bitcoin units, is if more people after you pour money into it, and that has historically been called "pump-and-dump" or "greater fool theory". Buying more units does not make the Bitcoin technology better. You can only speculate/gamble on Bitcoin units: I would never call it "investing". You are placing a bet that there will be more adopters/savers using Bitcoin or more people betting on it for other future betters. None of this really helps Bitcoin.
These investors would be better off actually investing on Bitcoin infrastructure, services, and the ecosystem as a whole. There are huge opportunities better than letting wealth sit around waiting for more people to buy units.

Communism doesn't work. It only sounds great in theory. I'd rather people aspire to work hard, get educated, and behave like responsible adults. Volunteer and give as intelligent adults. If people cared about the South Side of Chicago, they can do things about it without getting the government involved. 
Stealing from others isn't a solution. Having the government get involved is a cop-out from actually doing anything and taking personal responsibility. If the majority of the people wanted to help, they can and should go ahead and do it, without making it some legal mandate. If the majority of people don't give a rats ass about the poor, then making it a legal mandate means the government no longer represents the people. In either case, the government doesn't need to be involved in this problem.
The root cause of poverty isn't a lack of handouts from government. It's much deeper than that. If anything, government handouts have only made things worse. It's created huge populations of people who depend on it.
Nobody is arguing that people don't need some kind of assistance. But time and time again, the government has proven to be completely awful at providing it. It becomes political. Why let it? The US didn't even have an income tax until recently and economically flourished before that time. It didn't lack the money to function. It did lack the money to engage in unnecessary departments. The US had the highest young education ranks in the whole world until public education was introduced, and subsequently pulled the rank down to among the worst in the developed world.
When we take our ability to help the poor or educate our children and give it to the government, we forfeit some of the greatest opportunities for advancement and improvement. We let bureaucracy take over leading to waste, ignorance, and politics. Look at how technology has improved with every new generation of computers and smartphones. A competitive market to deliver faster, better results. Imagine that in education. You have schools competing to educate children better. To provide them with MORE resources and MORE effective ways, rather than following some "government-mandated" policy of what is supposed to be the "correct curriculum" and "method of teaching" and "standardized testing". Private schools destroy public education in most instances, because they have to deliver competitively. There are some public schools that do well, but that does NOT mean things couldn't be even better. Imagine if government got involved in regulating and standardizing mobile phones. We'd be using 1980's technology at best. Just the same, educational technology is decades if not a century behind. And we're suffering big time from it.
The country is a disaster and needs to be rebuilt with the principles that allowed it to flourish. Real money (like Bitcoin), real education (competitive private education only), real income (no income tax), real charity (not welfare), real savings (self-directed retirement, not ponzi-social-security, not war-mongering inflation), and real freedom.
Perhaps you're right, a temporary band-aid is to just keep redistributing the money by taking it from the rich, more and more. But at some point, the rich will say, "fuck this, im leaving the country for one that isn't so decrepit that the millions of poor people chase me around with pitchforks". And once they leave, there will be nobody left to finance the welfare. And they ARE LEAVING, believe it or not. More and more businesses are moving to other countries. Wealth is leaving America. Nothing is solved. We need to change the fundamental design, which isn't hard, it's what the founding fathers revolutionized. It's written into the constitution and the origins of the country.
Unless we tackle the root of this problem with education and real money, we're just going to be shoving issues left and right, robbing peter to pay paul, and in the end the same issue will crop up again in a different way.

I think it's more subtle. They treat us like children. Children who need to be protected from others and ourselves. In order to do that, we need more rules, restrictions, and laws. We are unable to be responsible for ourselves and we constantly look to them to solve our issues. We need government for things never dictated in the constitution now, such as "providing a retirement plan" and "maintaining a healthy economy" and "providing health care to all". We are all too stupid to handle these things on our own like adults. We need the government to be our parents, so that we can rid ourselves of the responsibility. They are protecting the ignorant majority. We give them all the power on a silver platter because we think they can solve all our problems, but instead they are simply taking away freedoms for the sake of the ignorant - all while the problems remain.

I'm always for open-source. If it's a wallet that you control completely and no company or person can deny you access to it (can Apple do it? I hope not) then it sounds good to me.
When I think of Bitcoin, I think of owning your own garden to provide food for yourself. With your own garden, it's exactly as you want it and you're more self-sufficient. Nobody can tell you what to do with your garden. But, it's definitely more work to maintain a garden. It requires skills. But once you have a garden, there's no farm or grocery that can try to rip you off with overpriced food or with whatever chemicals they try to put into it. It's food, the way you want it. But imagine if everyone, particularly the poor, were able to feed themselves? That would go a long ways towards solving hunger and hopelessness.
With the right tools, right education, and right mindset, I think people can definitely maintain their own Bitcoin garden. Secure, safe, and yet usable.
But, there will always be a demand for moving some trust to others to simplify the work of maintaining a garden. And so, for these people, I think it's fine for a more traditional "bank" like corporation to manage their wallet, but it's a risk. Being able to fall back to your own personal wallet will be around forever.
When you think about why Bitcoin was created, I think the idealistic goal would for every single person to manage and use their own wallet, as they do manage their own computer, house, car, etc. It takes some work and occasional help from trusted experts, but it would move power back to the people.

Transaction volume isn't very good I think, because sometimes I'll move coins between my own wallets several times a day. And, a ton of transactions are just tiny gambling amounts on SatoshiDice spamming the whole system.

The media covers what is sensational. Incumbent players have always fought technology that threatens to make them obsolete. The financial players will strive to work with media to make Bitcoin look bad.
But we should work to clarify that any tool can be used for good or bad. The hunting knife quickly became a weapon. The internet. Email.
I love the stories people share about how Bitcoin made their lives so much better and easier. Stories about how their financial lives are better without being tied to 3rd parties. All the good that can be done with Bitcoin, and specifically because of what Bitcoin brings to the table. A charity that uses Bitcoin in itself is great, but doesn't highlight the strengths of Bitcoin. They could have done the same charity using credit cards probably. So what I like are stories about Bitcoin remittances and how they saved their families lives. Or stories about getting blocked out of the traditional banking system and using Bitcoin independently in order to work successfully. Or a small merchant who kept themselves from going bankrupt by accepting Bitcoin, gaining a competitive edge from their competitors on fees, and going global with it.
When we fix the perception, the benefits of Bitcoin simply do their own marketing. At least, that's what I think.

Volatility. How to keep speculators out of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency so that the price is stabilized. Or perhaps, some other solution to high volatility. And no, a higher price doesn't mean more stability. It was in fact, more volatile at $1000 than ever. It dropped a huge % amount in a matter of days. Major adoption may help for volatility, but we need stability before major adoption. Chicken-or-the-egg problem here.

I think this is good news.
If a layer based on Visa (or Visa-like technology) is on top of Bitcoin, that's a huge leap up from what we have today with Bitcoin.
Even if widespread adoption is for this Visa-like layer:
* It might provide chargeback or insurance protection for consumers that is desperately needed given the number of Bitcoin-company scams
* It might provide a lending layer for consumers that is desperately needed (for some people who live paycheck to paycheck and need to buy groceries before their next paycheck and ran low due to some emergencies).
* It will be based off a real currency, not government fiat. That alone is a huge win.
* Merchants may eventually realize it's not worth paying the Visa-like fees, and will have a MUCH easier time switching to pure-Bitcoin transactions, if they are already on Bitnet.
* Bitcoin will grow from it.
I don't mind any of it, even if it's Visa-like. I want Bitcoin to be the underlying currency for everything. I don't care how much crap is built on top of it, as long as no government can create or control it arbitrarily.

Once a store owner sees this happening a bunch of times with different customers (who may happen to be your friends you put up to it as well), they will start literally seeing the losses.
Oh, and might not make a difference if it's some low wage cashier who doesn't care. So try to figure out when the manager or store owner is actually around to witness the event.

You don't need anyone's permission to use Bitcoin. Not the government. Not even some NY regulator. You can pay for things and get paid for things without *anyone* getting in your way. Even with cash, you sort of have to accept what the government says about it. And nobody wants to carry around gold coins.
And so, MtGox is a great (and quite unfortunate) lesson in what the true nature of Bitcoin really is and to understand that line between what is under your control, and what is under the control of others.
Trustless systems are superior to prevent frauds like MtGox. I wouldn't keep any significant amount of Bitcoin in Coinbase, or MtGox, or any Bitcoin Mining Pool. However, people *can* and *will* do that, which is fine, but it's so important to understand where the trust line is drawn. It's a new kind of responsibility that comes with the freedom of Bitcoin.
What I hope, however, is that long term people value the true free nature of Bitcoin and continue to get better at securing their Bitcoins themselves, rather than rely on 3rd party "security". I really like the thought of people who are empowered, rather than babied (like the government tends to do).
Again, this is all much *harder* than traditional systems because the responsibility is fundamentally bigger. I say it is worth it when you really consider the bigger picture.

There's no reason to get the government involved to provide the basics of living if that's what most people want.
Before big government, most people did receive a lot of help from charities and churches and neighbors. As responsible, intelligent adults, we can organize institutions for the homeless and poor. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor as well as the number of people who are considered poor has grown immensely since the government began playing a role in "solving poverty". Government does what people could do themselves, except 100X less efficiently. Particularly, when our money isn't being burned for wars that we don't need to be involved in.
I think the advancement came when we were originally instituted as a free country, and have been falling behind more and more as we became less responsible and a country of helpless children rather than adults.

Perhaps I'm thinking about this in the wrong way - in terms of trying to educate people on the security of Bitcoin (and the entire infrastructure).
Let's take a car as an example.
I don't "know" all the physical mechanics that make my car secure or safe to drive. I know I have brakes and they stop my car and I have brakepads and somehow the system gets the wheels to stop turning. But there's a lot of stuff in between that is just a big mystery. But I'm still pretty confident in my car, mostly because of all the years of successfully working brakes in most cars and inspections/certifications. It gives me a level of trust that hopefully isn't completely ignorant that lets me drive my car.
And there are a ton of other parts in my car that "could go wrong" - bolts on the tire, fuel tank, engine, who knows. And I don't know all the ways in which every part could go wrong.
And so with Bitcoin, and the computers we use, a bunch of stuff could go wrong. 
But what if computers had 5-start "vulnerability-testing" certification by security professionals, and consumers bought their computers based on such things? Well, we sort of do that now already. But maybe something more obvious, or made specifically for Bitcoin users?
The tricky part about computers is that software often needs to be patched for vulnerabilities. So the ratings would probably need to be tied to the software versions. Perhaps some software that could tell you the an approximate system risk level for handling Bitcoins safetly given your current setup? Maybe it could detect when you're on an unencrypted WiFi network and immediately "go red" indicating your system is not secure. And also there's quite a big incentive to break in to computers for monetary gain, versus "basic physical vehicular failure" which isn't really incentivized.
Then there's that whole ugly part of patching an vulnerable system doesn't guarantee that someone didn't already use the vulnerability and set up everything they need to do to make sure they can continue to exploit your system. A patch can protect against future break-ins, but won't stop the burglars who already got in.
Anyways, computer security (or information security) doesn't seem like a ho-hum easy topic to me or for average users.

Bitcoin is a miracle for people who do care. And I think that's the user base we want, at least for now.

When a lot of people think of "ponzi" they are thinking of a scam where one person makes money only because of the next sucker in line. 
That might not be an accurate description of "ponzi" but there is that type of speculation in a non-business investment of any scarce collectible such as Bitcoin.
Bitcoin prices only go up because the next person is willing to buy some at a higher price. There is NO other reason for the price to go up. In that way, it feels like, and maybe is a scam. Things like stocks actually have earnings and business models that help them grow internally, but a Bitcoin unit is just a unit. There is only an indirect relationship between the adoption and growth of the technology, with the price of a unit.
With that said, I wish fewer people treated it like a stock or speculative commodity and more like a very simple long-term store of wealth. Unfortunately, there's people who think it's the ticket to the moon which is just hype and causes volatility spikes.

There is hope if we can correct the misinformation.
There are people who believe that the success of Bitcoin is the price. That if Bitcoin was worth $10,000 per coin, then Bitcoin has somehow "won" the game. And that to invest in Bitcoin means to buy Bitcoin. Well, investing in Bitcoin-the-currency is actually quite different from investing in Bitcoin-the-technology. And speculators are best to speculate on the technology, and not the idea that some other people will buy coins after you did. That's pretty scammy. I could achive the same speculative investing with tulips and baseball cards and beanie babies.
There are a lot of people who believe in the wrong thing, such as the idea that Marijuana is a dangerous drug and should be illegal. However, with education, real facts and data, we can enlighten those people. I think people are just misinformed about Bitcoin and think that believing in Bitcoin means buying more BTC. We can help spread the right message and prevent unnecessary buying, and thus get towards a steady market.
It will never be perfect, there will always be misinformed people, but I have faith that as a community, if we work together, we can get people to understand the difference between investing in the Bitcoin technology and throwing money at the Bitcoin currency in hope of riches.

You are right. If more people use Bitcoin, the price will go higher.
But there's another group of people who don't use Bitcoin at all, and all they do is speculate on the price. When they dump money into the Bitcoin units only for the sole purpose of "cashing out" later with some big win, the price will also get higher and higher, but not necessarily because it's being adopted more and more.
And so, that secondary audience is quite scam-like to me. 
I think we should encourage the first group, and actively discourage the second group (if they truly believe in Bitcoin as a technology, they can help by NOT dumping their money into it for the sake of turning some big profit in the future).
We won't be able to stop all speculation, but at least we can help prevent some misinformed speculation - people who honestly believe that they are somehow helping Bitcoin by dumping tons of money into units of it.

Because it doesn't affect Bitcoin as a store of value. Inflation scares people, and that would cause people to flock to Bitcoin as a store of value.
Even if every merchant in the world used Bitcoin, there's no reason for the price of Bitcoin to change. It could just as easily cost 50000 BTC to sell an item as it costs 0.00005 BTC to sell an item. 
The only thing that really changes it is when fundamentally people move away from one or the other.

The problem is we keep poorly informing people that the benefit of Bitcoin is the growing price of Bitcoin.
In every way, that sounds like a scam.
We need to get people to stop throwing money at Bitcoin and get these news outlets to stop talking about the "price of Bitcoin" as if it was some stock and as if Bitcoin was somehow better or showing success if it had a higher price. (Or conversely, failing if it had a lower price)
This association is nonsense. Bitcoin works 100% as-is regardless of price, and if anything, works even BETTER when it's market value is stable.
I wish people would stop thinking that they are helping Bitcoin by dumping tons of money into it. The only people they are helping are people who bought earlier coins. And that's not the point of Bitcoin.
Only we can fix this reputation and image of Bitcoin. We need to educate people, but it's very understandable. Even within the Bitcoin community itself, we can't agree on this. It's somehow too controversial and there are really people who think that hyping Bitcoin "to the moon" is a good thing. That kind of unfounded price jerking isn't at all useful or helpful to Bitcoin and, as far as I'm concerned, 100% valid to say it's like tulip mania in it's psychology.

What if the bug is that they can create coins? They can create 2000, nobody knows about them. Then slowly sell them. Doesn't have to come from active addresses. If you can reverse the theoretically irreversible, to any outsider, it would just seem like they were really lucky. They successfully found a 25 BTC block using a 1 MH miner about 100 times within the span of a week. Sure, raises some flags. But they can do it slowly, without anyone noticing maybe. I'm certainly not looking for some magic miner out there who is finding blocks while the bigger pools are getting all the major attention.

And I would argue that gold speculation is just as shady as Bitcoin speculation. Gold's prices wouldn't increase outside of higher demand. It doesn't create new products and services and grow internally. It doesn't report earnings or do research for market opportunities. It is a piece of metal. And anyone buying Gold is just hoping that more people buy Gold after they do. And that's it. It's a very simple game of greed and speculation, not investment.

On volatility:
* 
Here's an article on currency speculation: 
From 


Some regulatory attempts:
From: 


There are a couple concepts to understand:
* 
* 
Here is a question: Could we self-regulate the exchange markets?
Let's suppose each of the major exchanges voluntarily implements a system that prevents wide swings in market price - and there are fairly easy ways of doing that. A "throttling" mechanism for traders can slow down what could potentially be a big spike. Would there be enough agreement between the large exchanges to implement it? The smaller exchanges may not, but since the volume there is small anyways, they may not impact the volatility.
Second question: Could we design a mechanism directly into the Bitcoin protocol that could help prevent rapid speculative bubbles? Since speculation is a function of fiat currency (or quite frankly, anything acting as a base of value), perhaps not.
From my perspective, speculation is equivalent of email spam. It's more of an attack on Bitcoin than a function of it. There are heuristic mechanisms to help prevent spam, various detection methods.
How could we prevent Bitcoin spam? We need to be able to differentiate between valid exchange and speculative exchange, just like separating real email from spam email.
But the ultimate gatekeeper here are the exchanges.
There have been discussions about distributed exchanges or decentralized exchanges. And perhaps in such a system, we could have a bit more control over tracking and throttling exchange - but it seems unlikely.
It's a tough problem, but I think worth solving if we do want Bitcoin to be stable and used as a currency, store of value, and unit of account.
Edit: Another idea that came to my mind is as follows.
Price stabilization pools.
Imagine an exchange such as Bitstamp introducing a single price stabilization pool in which users can join. This is a special pool of funds dedicated to price stabilization. Users who are Bitcoin advocates and desire price stability can voluntarily enter this pool with some amount of money, which collectively, can provide a large amount of weight. 
Now, when there is a price move, the exchange automatically puts in the reverse order from the pool account that counters the move. This effectively returns the price to what it was before automatically.
In order to work properly against normal growth and corrections, the pool will operate on a formula that calculates volume, typical order sizes, as well as a normalized "pool vote" of how much movement is acceptable. Also, there would be a cutoff if a pattern is appearing that cannot be controlled by the pool. This is to protect the pool from a major shift in valuation (such as large players attempting to move the markets).
If this pool is large enough that collectively it easily encompasses the size of even the largest typical traders easily, perhaps it can act to help stabilize the volatility. Imagine a $200m stabilization pool of 200,000 users who each put in an average of $1,000. Now, a large $10m player can try to swing the market, but the stabilization pool would activate and act against it. It sort of "locks-in" the price. 
Maybe this is just crazy thinking, but I'm just brainstorming on the fly.

There are too many people living on welfare, medicare, social security, lack valuable skills/education in order to earn a valuable wage for me to think that *most* people can take care of themselves.
Just look at the Ebola crisis. Everyone is looking to the government, criticizing Obama. When did the government become "Ebola management handlers?" Where in the constitution is that?
What if, instead, we had a responsible, adult society that institutionalized a health organization that would work together with private hospitals and private transportation agencies? What if the airlines, in order to provide a safe and secure product for it's customers, worked very closely with this organization? It could ground flights or check passenger histories themselves, because they need to produce a high quality safe product for their customers. Or else, their customers will leave or sue them.
But instead, we keep asking government to take responsibility for us, so that we don't have to act like adults. We ask the government to shut down the flights, to regulate the spread, to do all this nonsense. And they are failing so bad at it, that I don't see why anyone in their right mind would trust the same people who gave us the "DMV" to also deal with a highly dangerous epidemic. You're basically asking for failure.
Will people take care of themselves someday? I hope so, or else we're pretty doomed as a species. We're approaching an unprecedented energy crisis, a global pandemic, deteriorating global war situations, a looming financial crisis, exponential population growth with dwindling resources, global warming. There is no government in the world that is going to save the planet. People need to step up in an unprecedented way, because the bureaucracy will fail us. Every time.

I don't deny it's optimistic. And I've all but lost any hope of reigning in an out-of-control government that spies on it's citizens, tosses out habeas corpus, steals money from unborn children, destroys people's ability to save money from inflation, forcing unnecessary consumerism to destroy our planet with waste products (mountains of plastic trash and useless toys and gas guzzling and junk).
I am a huge fan of government. When operating with ideal restrictions, they provide useful functions - building roads, providing police, infrastructure, etc. But when turned into the nanny-state welfare-warfare state, and given a blank check to steal from those who never authorized the destruction of their money - living citizens and unborn children, it is simply broken and will come to terms via total bankruptcy like Rome or revolution/uprising. If everyone is either poor or in jail (or both), people will become willing - as a matter of survival - to start risking their life in order to save it.
I used to think voting, political activism, etc. had hope - but unfortunately I'm one of those burnt-out people who have tried to rally for change and all the efforts simply don't even make a dent. Want to vote non-democrat non-republican? Forget it. Waste. Of. Your. Time.
Nobody in power is going to authorize you to make the change in the world that is necessary. In fact, they will fight you at every step.
Bitcoin is a weapon of mass peace that cannot be denied. You need no one's permission to start using it, and rather than "hoping for change" - or "rallying for change", using Bitcoin is actual change. On a very individual level, it's changing the world without having to wait for it.

How do you think the government does these things? Uncontrolled access to money.
What does Bitcoin do? Control that access.
I don't think "massive income inequality" will be an issue. It will either not exist, or if it does, not affect anyone at all. If everyone could afford a more-than-sufficient lifestyle to feed themselves, their family, have health insurance, etc. why would they care that a handful of some have way more money? That is none of their business. I say poverty does not come from capitalism, but rather from a government and monetary system that is fundamentally corrupt. And a government, as corrupt as it may want to be, will be absolutely restricted (hands tied) with a budget of money it cannot create at a whim.
Why would anyone bother adopting bitcoin if it wasn't for political reasons? Just for random fun?
Money is what makes the world go around. It's the cornerstone of what things are going on, and if you can't see that, I don't know what else to say.

Not in the long term. If he's just in it for some gains, he'll just dump it when it's convenient. All this becomes noise and unnecessary volatility. All the people selling were itching to sell it. For some reason. And adding more people who are going to be itching to sell it doesn't help.
You are right, he might make it a bit less volatile now, balancing things out. But there's a difference between something that goes up and down 20% every day and averages to $100, and something that barely moves every day and averages to $100. 
Both are the same price, but I would argue the first is more volatile regardless of final price.

Well, I meant in the form of government inflation. These miners are investing and possibly NOT going to get much from it. But at the same time, the risk they are making has due rewards.
I think the worst kind of inflation (theft) happens when a magical entity is allowed to take money out of your pocket.
So the bank gives you 1% interest while the "main bank" creates another trillion dollars out of thin air thus stealing 5-10% (or maybe more?) out of your wallet every year. But at least you're getting that 1% from the bank and also that 2-4% from your credit card, right?
Your purchasing power with dollars has overall declined in the last 20 years significantly. I hope that in 20 years, it will be clear that the purchasing power of Bitcoin has maintained (or even improved).
It's possible that it will collapse, but it won't be because some bureaucrats decided on a whim to print some more money to engage in some unprovoked world policing.

Why would that be?
If Bitcoin had a ton of attention from large fund managers and the likes, certainly some bad news can tank a huge market cap stock sometimes 20-30% in a day.
For me, it depends on HOW we get to 10k per coin.
If it's because simply millions of people are using it with very few speculators, and that's simply how much it needs to be worth for people to hold a little in their wallet and do their daily transactions, excellent!
But if it's because a small number of people have put a ton of speculative dough into it for the sake of making a few bucks on the upturn, then we're going to be talking about a very volatile $10k coin maybe moving many % every day or week.

You seem to lack basic understanding and importance of capitalism, competition, and education. If you don't understand that people will move businesses if the regulatory or economic environment is better in a different country, you are unrealistic. But there's no point in arguing, because the proof is in the pudding. Every damn day, we see the government failing the people.


You think low income inequality comes from taxation policies and not from the fact that the population is grossly undereducated? And the fact that we have a monetary policy that destroys savings - which impacts the poor the most?
Of course businesses do best in an environment of low income inequality, which is exactly why so many are going to leave. Our government programs are creating so much inequality, that it's becoming the worst environment for businesses.


which corresponds nicely to the growth of the size of government over the last 50 years


it's dangerous to measure "business prospering" by looking at the overall economy, particularly if it's only the top businesses succeeding which brings the average up, while the majority of businesses are struggling
As the government has grown, the country has eroded. By every possible constitutional measurement.
If you don't think that is true, you will see how much worse things are in 5 years and in 10 years. I don't need to convince you, it will happen and you will see it for yourself.
Privacy gone, education levels worse, poverty levels worse, health care in worse shambles than ever, ... you cannot expect bureaucrats to solve these problems.
You think adding a capital gains tax of 5% is going to solve the poverty problem? It won't. And then people will ask for 15%. Then 35%. Then 50%. Then 90%. At what point do you think these companies are going to leave? You think they will stay no matter what? There is a breaking point to every business. And that breaking point is much lower in threshold than it takes to solve the poverty problem. Because they shouldn't be connected.
More freedom = Less bureaucracy = more competition = Better education = less poverty.
I'm not saying it's an overnight fix. And social programs will help with the transition. But there's no way a 5% hike is a permanent fix to poverty.

Let's say Bob sells his home for 100 BTC to Alice.
Alice gets a 100 BTC mortgage loan from Bits Fargo.
However, since Bob also uses BF for his checkings/savings, the BTC never moves out of the bank. It would just go in a circle.
On a larger scale, if tons of people stored their money like this, BF could just keep an internal ledger and give out "loans" for BTC that doesn't even exist. Money out of thin air, and fractional reserves.
Second example.
Let's say Bob buys a new computer from Oldegg Computers.
And OC uses Coinboss for payment processing.
But Bob also uses Coinboss for a wallet.
So rather than having money move in a circle yet again, the payment is simply recorded in an internal ledger.
And so, let's say Coinboss now allows BTC loans up to a credit limit (like 2.5 BTC). They can do this without actually owning the BTC when you buy from Oldegg, since they just keep track of the ledger.
In both examples, both Coinboss and BF falls apart if someone tries to pull all their money out (bankrun) just like the current banking system would.
The way this should be prevented is proof-of-reserves and decent decentralization of all these services. Also, demanding that funds transfer in BTC in all cases, rather than just ledger magic.
Also, a watchful eye on government policies on what ledger practices are considered "as good as BTC". Government-backed BTC "notes" would become trash if the goverment became unable to pay (or people tried to redeem all their notes out of the system).
Federal reserve is a scam that a lot of people have fallen for. Just got to watch out for such scams.

Ideally, it would constrain the government to make hard choices about spending and taxation. It would require people to voluntarily contribute to projects, rather than force them to. And ideally, the government would not fund any project that it simply cannot afford.
Many projects are simply designed to fix a system that the government broke in the first place. We strip the people of their wealth, then provide a service to help the poor. The government's role is severely diminished when people are empowered. Imagine if people owned their money - and they could afford to do things without help from the government.
The world has limited resources. It doesn't make sense to have an infinite currency when we don't have infinite resources.
Everything the government puts it's hands into is proven to be less efficient than a free market alternative. Now, there are some things that should be handled by a government - such as police, fire, and even national military is not unreasonable. But things like education, health care, etc. functions far better when there's competition for higher quality and more effective service. If you look at things such as computer technology, every year, things get faster and cheaper. But you look at the medical world, and things are getting less affordable and slower.
Why do we need public education? The obvious answer is that not everyone can afford private education. Why can't they? Well, when the government keeps taking money out of the pockets of everyone - not only do people have their own money stolen, but people have even less to give for charitable purposes (like families who would need money to pay for private education). 
If we have public education because we need to help the poor, then we should have a voice to that effect rather than have it forced upon us by wasteful legislation. If we truly feel the need to be charitable, then we should simply -be- charitable. No public education is necessary. Give money directly to charities and groups that help provide money to people who struggle to pay for education. 
If people as a whole, believe that the poor should get educated, then that will be the effect. If people as a whole don't believe it, then that too will be the effect. Either way, it's more efficient than having a 3rd party (the government) intrude and require all sorts of mechanisms that only slow down the system and make it pretty much impossible to compete and improve the technologies required for better education. Competition forces bad schools out. We want better performance, and parents (and students) should demand it. Right now, they can't demand it - they get public education - they pay for it through taxes, and there is pretty much no choice. No freedom, no quality, just a stinky system that is producing some of the least educated youth in the entire world.
So, long story short, the government will be able to fund as much as the people are willing for it to fund, and nothing more. The government will not have ZERO. It will have funds, from many sources. But the more the money goes back into the hands of the people, the more effectively it will be used. We strip out the third party, we re-introduce competition, and a whole new world opens up. Every "problem" we face today due to poverty is improved if we remove poverty.
Will there still be poor people? Of course. But when the general public is more wealthy and not frantically afraid of losing it with 40% in taxes and then another 20% in inflation every 10 years, then there's a better chance they will help out impoverished people. And if they don't, then certainly, it does not make sense to build a system that doesn't reflect what the people want to do. And anyways, that's sort of the point of a representative government - to help not allow 51% ruling over 49%.
Containment is not a bad thing. Governments should fear the people, not the other way around. And what Bitcoin introduces is a system that has *reasonable* constraints. If we can't fund projects with all the money we've got, then perhaps that project really doesn't make any sense.
Gold and silver is good, but extremely inconvenient. Which opened the doors to representative money, which then transformed into infinitely producible debt notes. With Bitcoin, now we have the benefits of gold and silver, but actually very convenient (and sometimes even more convenient) than debt notes. For example, counterfeiting is a nightmare. In fact, I don't even know how to personally verify when someone gives me dollars or even a gold bar, that it is real.
But with Bitcoin, knowing the source code, having mathematics and cryptology PROVIDE a well-known verification, that gives me huge confidence in any money I get.
It's better than gold and silver, and it limits government to doing only what it can afford as provisioned by the say of the people. And the government can no longer rob people indirectly. They can still do it directly, through taxation and sorts, but people will (and should) revolt against a 95% income tax.
And that's almost the effective amount we're being taxed now if you consider all the variables - stealing from the next generation, inflation, creating waste, losing out on technology, losing out on education, actual taxes, unnecessary services, corruption, counterfeiting, war, etc. etc. Earning $1000 meant a big deal in 1950. Why should it mean that 64 years later, as a person saved it and is retiring, that the $1000 is absolutely not a big deal in 2014? It makes no sense. We're all getting robbed - it's just not everyone realizes it.

I am not a fan of this idea that if the chance of it happening is rare, then we shouldn't care. If we go by that rule, maybe we shouldn't care if 99% of children don't get molested or 99% of people don't get murdered. Who cares?
Also, the implications of this are much larger than "closing an account". You won't care until it happens to you, and they can do things far more insidious (read "bail-ins").


This is the focus on the wrong thing that I am trying to say. Things have to be looked at on a whole, not a microcosm of tiny benefits. And the attitude that, "if it's not saving me my (fake) money, then I don't like it" without understanding that Bitcoin is an open, free, shared technology that you can own with other people. 
What are you contributing to Bitcoin to making it better than your credit card?


Not necessarily. They can track where the money went, and just because it went to some person X who then spent *their* money on something else, doesn't mean that is *your* spending habit. You don't have to have 1 wallet. And again, the point is not these things.


Understandable, but again, Bitcoin is your currency as much as it is mine. What are you doing to solve this?
Looking at Bitcoin as a completely new technology and then comparing it to the enormity that is say government currency, of course there is volatility. The point is that despite that, it's worth it for the principles.


I would disagree with this. I think just because people have given up on a 2-party system that bickers about non-issues all day and generally has the same horrible solutions doesn't mean there are not a huge number of libertarian-focused people. If anything, economically libertarian.
I have no idea what a felony has to do with anything. Nobody is asking you to commit a crime.


Again, it's not fair to compare this nascent technology today.
But regardless of my opinion of these things, I am not going to try to convince you if you've already made your mind up. Unfortunately, when your dearly-loved government system falls apart in bankruptcy, I won't have much sympathy either.
But my point wasn't that I think Bitcoin is superior to everyone and anyone in the short-term. My point was that there are people with the attitude that "Bitcoin" is supposed to fix these things or perform something for them - but there is no entity called "Bitcoin, Inc." that is responsible for that.
Most issues and complaints go into the wind. If you want to improve your situation, the long-term health of the world, and Bitcoin, it's up to you to do it. And me. And all of us. Not the government, not a corporation.
Anyways, just my "biased opinion" I guess.

Bitcoin is the Linux of money. It's fucking amazing and kicks ass when you know what you're doing. It's light-years better than the alternatives if you're a computer expert. But if you're expected to be spoon-fed (like average consumers), you'll have one hell of a nightmare.
We need something to bridge the gap. Like Android did for Linux and what Apple Mac OS X did for FreeBSD. They provided consumer support and consumer-oriented focus.
It would be cool if there was a company like RedHat for Bitcoin that provided professional-grade sales and support for the Bitcoin platform for anyone who wanted to use it. Consulting, 24/7 help-line, and some place where people can get cordial help without praying for the good-will of some volunteer on a random web forum to give assistance. As much as Reddit is awesome and everyone here is super helpful, sometimes it makes sense for customer support to be commercialized for the sake of everyone.
Consumers don't wants to hear RTFM when they have questions. As much as we want them to spend the time, get educated, etc. they won't. All we can hope for is that they follow the intelligent early adopters (us) into the light. And I am sure they will, because that's the definition of what it means to be an average consumer today.

If Coinbase is smart, it will change to serve it's customers needs. As a customer, if we demand that the regulations change, we can both go directly to the regulation, but also we can influence Coinbase to help make the same changes though their reach, through lobbying, through whatever is necessary for them to keep their customers happy. In fact, they might be able to make a big impact, if they grow large enough and their customer base hinges on the fact that customer privacy is more important than KYC/AML.

I would say yes, but I would also say it's ridiculous that mathematics could be banned. If you're banning the illegal behavior and not the constituents of that behavior, then really they should make it clear that they are banning "any mechanism or process that competes with the central bank" and not just Bitcoin per say. In other words, you don't get to have things of value and the government owns your soul.

100% agreed. Total B.S. and it's not robocoin's fault either.
I wish I could say I had faith in our democratic system and that people will claim their freedom over their security, but unfortunately I don't think that is the case. Because if it was, people would be in an uproar already. Unfortunately, people are as afraid of terrorism as they are about Ebola, some hypothetical "Devil" who exists in the afterlife, and the boogey monster.
There's the long road of campaigning, education, political change. Won't happen. People don't care enough.
There's the medium road of protesting, rioting, revolution, overthrowing the government. Won't happen. People don't care enough.
And then there's the short road of claiming your privacy rights and avoid using any system that does not respect them. Hold on until one of two inevitable things happen:
* Complete bankruptcy of the nation
* A tipping point where people actually start to do something
I used to think that things could turn around, that we can fix things before it all falls apart and goes to hell. But every day I see things not getting better on a whole, and time running out, so now I believe something crazy has to happen for there to be any real change.
I believe that when the dust settles after the great collapse, people will look to rebuilding the economics which led to this chaos by using Bitcoin or at the very least, gold-backed currency.
And I hate to see people suffer, but I think the sooner we let it go to crap, the sooner we can get on to fixing things. And the longer we postpone it, the more horrible it will be. We are on the verge of an economic meltdown not seen since the Roman era.
Our rights as human beings must be violated to enough people to an extreme point at which they will begin to act.
Unfortunately, the flame is not hot enough right now for anyone to care, just as we don't care about falling off a cliff - as we feel like we're on solid ground, until we actually are. It will come, and when it does, it will be fast. Faster than the government can react. Faster than most people can get into Bitcoin to save themselves. It will be simply financial carnage.
I think it will begin when enough countries become sick of being ruled by the U.S. (which they are) and the atrocious war-mongering and complete disrespect of the U.N. where they all begin to reject this fake funny money being printed out.
As wealth in the U.S. diminishes, so will the power.
This will take time. But when it does happen, it will happen quickly. We're still a ways from it, as most countries respect the U.S. (for whatever reason) but that will change. And when it starts happening, brace yourselves.
Anyways, I sort went off-topic on a rant here.
My point is, I suggest you don't use robocoin for now, while all that ID-stuff is still required.

If you think of bitcoin as a currency, you can think to exchange one currency for another.
For example, you might exchange US dollars for Euros.
But that's only one way to acquire bitcoins. You can also get bitcoins from just selling something.
Let's say you have an old lamp that's worth $5.00. And you sell it on ebay for m฿8.29. You can get bitcoins that way too.
Another way is, let's say you mow your neighbor's lawn for $10.00. And she pays you m฿17.40 for your work. That's another way to get bitcoins.
Directly converting US dollars to bitcoin is certainly possible, but if you plan on using bitcoin as your primary currency in the digital world, then you'll want to think less about "buying bitcoin" and more about "earning bitcoin and spending bitcoin" instead. Then, you would have no need or use for US dollars at all.

Depends how far it collapses. I'm not talking about Armageddon. Just something closer to the collapse of the USSR when fiat became worthless. Or like the collapse of the Roman Empire. Or every other economic collapse. I don't think it will reach such a horrible point where even gold is worthless and people just want food or guns. There will still be people with skills who want to trade - farmers, craftsmen, teachers, carpenters, gunsmiths, even if the money is inflated to worthlessness. And bartering will still suck the same. So gold and bitcoin will be great.

The closest I could get to this was with joinsnapcard.com and ordering a $200 Visa card on giftcardmall. 
Unfortunately, after adding up all the fees on both giftcardmall, snapcard, shipping, etc. it's like a 10-20% overhead. So you end up paying like $230 for a $200 card.
If you don't mind the huge fees, it is a viable route.
It might be cheaper to convert your bitcoin to cash and use the cash to buy a visa gift card at a store like CVS or Target. They block visa gift card purchases via CVS/Target gift cards at the register, so you will have to use cash.
BTC and Visa don't mix well in my opinion. It's a huge waste of money trying to convert between them.

I meant it in the gold-like sense.
Even gold gets mined by the tons every single year.
Market price wise, I think Bitcoin is due for a correction when a bunch of miners experience too much pressure between a low Bitcoin price and their expensive costs of mining. They will be forced to take a loss. Bitcoin prices may drop as they dump what they have, but at the same time, the ridiculous mining rate might actually calm down a tad.
Regardless, I was just talking about the arbitrary money printing by the government, not the process of mining like there is with gold.

Bitcoin is democratic money. 
It's the best, most secure engineering solution to transferring money over the internet, as voted by it's acceptance by millions of other engineers, volunteers, and users. It offers an engineering breakthrough, decentralization technology used in a way never seen before.
Traditional, government-based money such as dollars are manipulated and counterfeit in many ways. It is money declared as such by the barrel of a gun. In contrast, Bitcoin is community-powered, openly-developed money: that is, honest money.
Ultimately, Bitcoin serves to protect the unalienable rights of the people - that your property cannot be stolen by force either through unjust laws such as civil forfeiture or through authoritarian government inflation.
Bitcoin is live, and flourishing, and growing. It is currently having the greatest impact in countries with troubled economies such as Venezuela and Cyprus.
It is literally saving the lives of hundreds, if not thousands of people every single day. It gives hope to the impoverished, strength to the oppressed, protection to the destitute, and accountability to the corrupt.
@_date: 2014-01-01 05:46:58
I think you're thinking in terms of complex traditional systems.
You can "transfer" money just by loading the same digital wallet you loaded money into while in AUS, when you are in the US. Bitcoin doesn't care where you are physically. A digital wallet is a digital wallet.
You don't need to move anything. Not even a computer. You don't need accounts anywhere.
Here are the steps:
1. Buy some BTC with AUD at some exchange.
2. Sell your BTC for USD at some exchange.
3. Do a wire transfer from the exchange to move the USD into a US bank account.
I believe the wire transfer costs will be pretty low and fixed. And you'll skip any kind of currency conversion fees. The only fees you'll pay are for the exchanges which are anywhere from 0.3% to 1%.
You can try eliminating that fee by using local bitcoin exchanges, but they can be more risky (due to scammers) and in the end, the fluctuating value of bitcoin may wipe out any 1% you were trying to save anyways.
The tricky part is getting a US bank account. I believe they ask for a US social security number and such.

Can we just put the blockchain on some CDN like akamai? Or at least, the first 20 GB of it or something?
Then it would be fast for anyone who wants to download it.
I don't know how the client works, but if there was an API that requested chunks of the file (perhaps using one of the existing HTTP ranged request protocols) on an as-needed basis, you could have clients utilizing the blockchain on a CDN (or any network source). I don't know if this is a bizarre construction, given the whole peer-to-peer nature of Bitcoin and the distributed nature of things. But if it adds a bunch of performance and we can switch out the hosting CDN to anyone else, then we can have pure data nodes and wallet network nodes separated. Which, I suppose is a lot like the existing thin-clients (Electrum, etc) anyways. I'm not sure where I'm going with this weird question.

I'm not saying you can't make tons of money trading Bitcoin. Sure, you can. If enough people jump in after you, you can get rich. But I don't think it helps Bitcoin as much as you think. And I can't say that is the primary goal of Bitcoin - a scheme to make people rich.
Consider the Winklevii. Have they helped Bitcoin as much as say the community of developers who built tools, such as mobile wallets and online exchanges?
If your only goal is to get rich, you can pretty much hype up any penny stock or unknown collectible and try to do it. And you can with Bitcoin, too. But I would say that's missing the point - the magic and awesomeness of what is Bitcoin. Becoming filthy rich with it was never my goal, personally. I care more about the technology.

I would say that maybe not all, but quite a few people replenish their bitcoin accounts after spending it. That should balance it out to some degree.
Selling and not replenishing is the same as selling bitcoin completely for USD (then buying something with USD). It's basically dumping bitcoin. Those people may be doing it inadvertently, but otherwise they've lost faith in bitcoin if they are not replenishing.
There are some long-term investors, but in the end, they are investors. I want bitcoin's price to stay stable for years, like I prefer $100 BTC for 5 years rather than $101 - $2000 range all over the place for 5 years which is technically still higher than $100. When bitcoin is stable, even the "long-term" investors are still investors, and so if theres no profit to be made, they will simply exit - move to an investment that has better returns than 0.0000001% per year.
I want technologists and gold-like savers and inflation hedgers into Bitcoin and get volatile investors out of it.
People think Bitcoin will be "successful" if it reaches $10,000 per Bitcoin. To me, that is an illusion of success if it's not backed up by REAL users (not investors) pulling the price up to $10,000 simply due to the fact that they need to keep a small amount in their wallet in order for Bitcoin to be used. That's real usage, and not hype. We're far away from that still.

I'm just saying that promotional gimmicks like these, at least for me, creates an impression that BTC is not valued by SOME people (the ones giving it away) even if there is still some market value for them.

I've been working on a project to [decentralize government]( that depends on Bitcoin to work but might be too ambitious. But I like the idea of replacing all the bad politicians with incorruptible software. What do you think? I guess it wouldn't make any money, so it's not worth investing.
I've had this other idea for a long time, which was to build out a service that would help physical retailers become Bitcoin exchanges on the spot. The retailers would earn a % of the fees, and people would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin at any retail store that has a cash register. Essentially Bitcoin "ATMs" everywhere, without any actual machine. The service would provide any licensing and legal framework necessary to support it, so the retailer wouldn't have to worry about that stuff.
Another Bitcoin idea I had was an app that ran a decentralized real-world service marketplace. People who wanted to earn money would sign up to provide helpful services (like giving people a ride in their car, running an errand, walk their dog, etc) and the app would help find these people via proximity. This basically would compete with or replace services like TaskRabbit and Uber, with a decentralized version of them that run on Bitcoin.
I have like 100 other ideas. It's kind of endless.
But I'm only one web developer, and I never have the time to really get these projects off the ground.

People are mining Bitcoin like crazy. They are investing huge amounts of money, and as the difficulty keeps rising, any hope of them making back their investment keeps going down. It's easy to be completely disadvantaged when you compare investing in mining and investing in Bitcoin directly. Any mining done with a future expectation of rise in value will be less than simply putting that amount of money into buying bitcoins directly.
So, unless a miner is making a profit right now, they should shut down. However, I believe there are people who heavily "invested" in mining, which makes no sense, because time is the greatest enemy to mining. If you don't immediately make money with it, it's a poor proposition to make money with it in the future.
And so, as the electricity bills come in and the realization that you are being squeezed out of the market, the mining has to slow or shut down. With that comes the sales of bitcoins, because, if not for anything else, they invested for the goal of making money. They don't want bitcoins, they want ROI. And as there is no ROI, they dump whatever they can get for their coins, to mitigate the loss.
A healthy slowdown of bitcoin price due to hyperbolic mining market is a good thing. It will settle down more, as more miners wake up and leave, while only a few are left able to compete and stay profitable at all times. It's also possible that the only people left mining are people who do it at a fully negative ROI, and purely because they love bitcoin and want to support it.
Then all the giant investment server farms all leave, because these server farms were built for the sole purpose of making their investor filthy rich. They are not doing it for charity.
The beauty of it is, once everyone is just doing it for charity, it all balances out, takes greed out of the equation, and bitcoin becomes a nice, distributed system (in terms of mining) again without a few big players at the top.
I hope that bitcoin prices continue to stabilize, and if that means it needs to go down due to over-mining, then so be it. I don't care about miners and their profits.

It will probably be one of the most difficult fights that mankind has faced simply because the odds are so much against one side.
In the American Revolution (which was also triggered over money, tax law, etc.), there was a chance to actually win against the British because the weapons were primitive enough. 
The importance of decentralized and non-counterfeitable money is at the core of democracy and the will of the people. Corporations and government (which are the same thing most of the time) will fight for their own survival.
And while there are enthusiasts and passionate activists who can help us, there is also a problem of massive fear and ignorance on the public side. This weakens the side even further.
In many ways, I feel like the government has already dealt a powerful blow that has people reeling back. Bitcoin is scary to most people, because it's a direct opposition to a government to which most people are afraid to go against. And they have good reason. It is horrifyingly scary to go against the current government. The fact that you cannot use Bitcoin as a currency under IRS tax rules, and rather have to treat it like a commodity to which you have to track every coffee, bagel, and gum purchase for capital gain or loss makes it completely absurd. And every time someone uses Bitcoin and forgets to do it, they risk possible prison time and extraordinarily high financial penalties for tax evasion. It's a huge risk to use Bitcoin. To use Bitcoin, you need the courage to stand up against unjust laws. And it's a very rare breed who has both the passion and good in their heart to do what is right and the courage to do it. The average person is not only disinterested in politics, but they are perhaps even more afraid of being convicted by the justice system.
Some say Bitcoin is unstoppable, and in a way it is. People who want to defy the system can do so. But without the proper legal framework to support it, it will always remain a niche technology of criminals (like torrents) and never become a part of the mainstream. And unlike torrents, Bitcoin's greatest potential begins when it becomes widely adopted. It's great as a niche technology, but it can do so much more.
This fight is as important, if not more so, than our rights to information and information property. It is a fight against something that not just impacts the MPAA and Hollywood, but impacts every single corporate banking interest which has been carefully built and fortified for the last 100 years.
And as much as I have admiration and respect for civilized process for reform, I'm not sure this fight will be won on a civilized battlefield. This truly cuts to the core and livelihood of the corrupt incumbents in a way that cannot be reversed and they will use every mechanism in their power to survive. They have far more tools of funding, media, police. 
Our tools are the internet and Bitcoin and the few rights we still have left.
It truly is a long shot.

While I agree with you, it doesn't go down easy for people who don't share the same views as you.
I think the goal is to ignite curiosity in them so that they feel the desire to learn more. They need to know that at its core is a group of volunteers and idealists, not companies and profits.
I feel like the average person isn't ready. I feel like that we need to target a very specific type of person to adopt BTC - one who is open-minded and also sick of economic abuses. Targeting the wrong person only causes problems.
And Bitcoin isn't ready for everyone because there is so much gray area. Taxation on Bitcoin is currently so convoluted that you need to report every little purchase you make, even if it's a cup of coffee you drank 11 months ago that nobody has the time or care to record correctly. And using Bitcoin then becomes criminal activity.
The right people to use Bitcoin are those who believe that such laws are immoral and want to help and learn more. The wrong people are those who feel the government is right, all crime is moral, and have a decided lack of interest unless something is pitched to them the right away.
In other words, like in the Matrix, some people are so consumed and integrated into their fantasy world that they will fight to keep it. They will consider you an enemy, a freak, or a villain if you say anything contrary to their view. You may want to help them, but they don't want to be helped.
We need to target people who want to be helped.

Speculating on Bitcoin units is like speculating on US pennies. Why would the value of a penny go up? It's a currency. Maybe it will be a prized penny later on, but that's not the point of the penny. The point is that it will be used for spending on something at some point. Bitcoin units are not baseball cards, tulips, stocks, or bonds. They are just units that, for the most part, only go up when other people buy them. And if that's ALL Bitcoin was, that sounds more like a scam than anything. It makes it LOOK like Bitcoin only has value because newcomers are being piled on and fooled. And I don't think that's right. Bitcoin is *so much more than the price*.

Having 1 person to trust is of course ideal. That isnt what decentralization of power tries to solve. The problem is what do you do when you can't trust one person? Absolute power corrupts absolutely. In the case of governments and banks, it's been shown that they are not trustable. And we can limit their ability to cheat people by making the system decentralized and accountable.

I think the difference reminds me of back when I was using Slackware Linux and the help I got was cold and rude and lots of RTFMs. It was frustrating and depressing. I then checked out Debian Linux which named their releases after characters from the movie Toy Story and everyone was super insanely friendly and helpful and I loved the distro!!!! I got very excited about it. And it grew and grew really fast.
Eventually it became a very legit, solid distro if not one of the best ones in the world. All because of the community.
And when we're talking about open source or cryptocurrency if the most important thing is the community, then the one with the most attractive, friendliest, open community will grow to become only stronger and more popular.
Bitcoin isn't really in danger because it's not like one group controls Bitcoin and one group controls Dogecoin. Bitcoin can be successful, if the community surrounding it is willing to support each other. And these communities are built by each person in it, and can change when the majority of users change.

Personally, I am not a fan of taxes on Bitcoin at all. I think the government should keep the tax laws much simpler. And if the government didn't waste so much money on needless wars and failing programs like the war on drugs, they wouldn't need to collect so much taxes anymore.

I would, but I'd want to know that the goals were aligned with what I think really helps Bitcoin.
For example, part of the marketing needs to counter the negative branding Bitcoin keeps getting. Everyday I hear people say Bitcoin is about illegal drugs and ponzi schemes. It's sort of frustrating.
At the same time, I think we need to be strategic. If we address it, then we put that discussion into the spotlight. Even if we're right, we end up making the focus being the argument of if it's illegal or legal and people will generally not understand the argument and throw it in the "gray area". And now, forever, Bitcoin is sort of in the gray area of being legal or illegal. That's not good for Bitcoin.
So maybe the best way to address it is to constantly focus on how much better it is to do X through Bitcoin. Whether it's global remittances or paying for a beer or lending money to a friend. And when someone brings up illegal drugs, just tell them, "Yeah, just like cash. I wouldn't blame the cash though."
I wouldn't want to be a part of something that tried to market investing into buying a ton of Bitcoins. In fact, I would have to say that I want the marketing campaign to say that is generally nonsensical since it's more a medium of transmitting value and there's no reason for the price to go higher other than more people buying it later. If that's what everyone does, it becomes this MLM-like scheme. It could be done with envelopes with $1 in it or with penny stocks. That isn't what Bitcoin is about, nor does it help Bitcoin at all.
In other words, I really want the message to be clear and agreeable to me before I would finance part of this marketing team.
But if the message is right, I would be fairly interested. I think Bitcoin needs a good advocate voice to help set records straight about it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:53:05

I am hoping that the leading Bitcoin businesses will help the rally, as it seems like government representatives enjoy being swayed by money. Although the banks are quite large and have a ton of "donations" to give, I think the collection of all non-banking companies/industries who instead would benefit from free use of Bitcoin could together have a big impact on legislators.

Bitcoin is freedom. Freedom doesn't care who you are biologically. I sort of want to keep it that way.
I don't know why people seem to attach importance to grouping people by one or two characteristics and then figuring out if the under-representation is some kind of problem. It's usually not a deliberate conspiracy. And unless there's an outright prohibition or unfairness about it (which is rare), why draw unnecessary relationships to it?

I think it's a pretty good defense.
I question the validity of money (property) laundering itself. Making it illegal to be an intermediary hurts those who may not have asked all the relevant questions to buyers and sellers about their motives. That's not really fair to anyone and I don't think constitutionally it's right according to personal privacy to ask about whether a given purchase is being performed to hide the source of money.
I may launder money for legitimate reasons, such simple privacy - not because I'm doing anything illegal. To make it a crime means privacy is a crime. Which I guess it is illegal today in our great surveillance security check-point everywhere state.

For some people, it is black and white. I'm saying there are people who don't give a damn about Bitcoin technology, they just see Bitcoin plastered all over CNN and CNBC and think, "I want to get rich off this thing - whatever it is I don't care". These people, in my opinion, simply are not the greatest asset to Bitcoin in the world.
And obviously I can't stop anyone from speculating in Bitcoin.
But, what I think is that there are people who are new to Bitcoin who are ALSO very NEW to investing and speculating. I know this, because of the number of people getting "burned in Bitcoin market trading". And this makes me sad. These new users don't deserve to get burned.
So I hope to help them by steering them away from this idea that Bitcoin is all about market trading and trying to get rich off the units. Sure, buy Bitcoin but with the expectation of using it or keeping it long-term, and not be so concerned about the up and down of the price. That is simply my advice for newcomers.
I am not targeting experienced speculators. I have no advice for them and they wouldn't listen to me anyways.

I'm just saying, I prefer high adoption causing high price, than high price causing high adoption. I feel like it's more sound, and feels less like Bitcoin is a scheme to get filthy rich. The media really makes it sound like that is all Bitcoin is, and the general population when it hears that you can get rich buying Bitcoin as long as more people buy it after you do, it just sounds really scammy.
Of course the price of Bitcoin units will increase as more people use it. I am just not a huge fan of the price of Bitcoin units skyrocketing because a few guys think they can make mad money from it. And as soon as there is a big buy for the purpose of a large transaction, they tank the price by "cashing out", leaving the person who bought the Bitcoin for the purpose of a transaction left in the dust losing most of their value. Essentially, the transactor got ripped off by the speculator. If this is done enough times in various sizes causing all kinds of volatility, fewer people will even want to transact in such an unstable system where you buy 5000 BTC and when you go to send it to someone a couple weeks later, you are sad because some people wanting to "take a bit of profit" ends up tanking the price.
But regardless, I can't stop speculators. All I'm trying to point out is that, for those people who actually care about Bitcoin as a technology and want it to become a ubiquitous currency, looking for strategies buy low and sell high to "cash out big" doesn't help Bitcoin as much as you might think.

I would say real users were using Bitcoin just fine even at a lower price. Remember, the infamous Bitcoin pizza? It really does work at practically any price. Really well.
And I agree if someone wants to flow large amounts of money, they WILL buy large amounts of Bitcoin thus pushing up the price, but that's because they want to make that kind of transfer. That is user adoption to me and a good reason to buy Bitcoin. What I am saying is that people who just buy Bitcoin to "cash out" later at a higher price (pure speculation), it's not helpful, adds volatility, and very different than buying for the purpose of transfer or long-term storage of value.
I'm not saying people shouldn't buy Bitcoin. I'm just saying let's be honest, if you're just hoping more people buy it later so you can cash out rich, that's not my dream of what Bitcoin can be.

It's like mixing two colors of paint like red and blue to make purple. 
How hard would it be to decrypt the purple back into two buckets of red and blue paint?
It's insanely hard. Many magnitudes harder than the effort to mix the two paints.
Brute-force methods to decrypt your bitcoin public key would take more attempts than there are atoms in the universe.
That being said, you're more likely to lose your bitcoin due to:
1) Human error - oops I left it on a computer and a hacker grabbed it
2) Poor encryption - oops, I generated my key using a NSA-backdoored random number generator
To avoid getting Gox'ed don't trust anyone who "holds your coins on your behalf". If you don't hold the private key to the coins yourself, then you're at a huge risk. Most exchanges and coin storages are risky. Don't store any coins with them. This includes coinbase, circle, bitstamp, btce, etc. - Pretty much ALL of them hold coins on "your behalf". Don't let them.

I want to take this time to reflect on this:
We as a Bitcoin community, if we truly want Bitcoin to succeed, should aim to actively discourage speculation of buying Bitcoin units. Speculation of Bitcoin units hurts key value propositions of Bitcoin such as their store of value and unit of account. An increasing price of Bitcoin does nothing for adoption, transaction, or the technology in general.
Speculation of Bitcoin units is a psychological enemy, just as much as governments telling us that Bitcoin is dangerous. We need to look beyond such things and help newcomers to Bitcoin also understand these things.
We don't need a gigantic Bitcoin price. Yes, mainstream adoption may cause a gigantic price, but we're not going to get the mainstream adoption by  causing the price to fly all over the place, and  by focusing too much on the price rather than it's usability.
I want Bitcoin to succeed, even if it means the price being exactly the same as it is today. The implications to our freedom, privacy, security, and power are too important.
Please, I gently implore you to join me in this new way of thinking about Bitcoin. We can do a lot of good.
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:56:07
Cool. I kindly implore you to consider the possibility that the price will go DOWN and that if you're just going to sell it when it does, then you'll be contributing in a small way to undesirable volatility. So, I really hope that you are in it for the long-haul and that recommend that you don't put in more than you can afford to lose.
With that said, I think if you want to avoid verification you should go with a local trade. Paypal will be tough, because it's easy to scam people (with a chargeback). I personally use Mycelium because it's private, no verification, and easy to buy BTC with it using cash.
Oh, and also, even as a long-term storage of your hard-earned money, I don't really recommend it in the current environment. It's highly volatile right now, and it might be a good idea to wait until more speculators abandon it. The price of Bitcoin is a real mess, falling over 30% in the last 30 days.
I recommend to jump in when Bitcoin has stabilized to a steady range for at least a month.

I can't argue that greed isn't attractive. I'm simply saying let's recognize it for what it is, and that is greed.

Don't you want to know the basis for Bitcoin to be a "excellent or shitty medium to store your value" before you put money into it? What would cause it to be either?
Depending on your time span, I think gold and silver might be a better store of value; maybe for 3+ years. For less than 3 years, I would stick to government-backed for stability, like treasuries/bonds or maybe CDs or something. I'm only comfortable in Bitcoin in holding value a 10+ year timespan because it's still very small and volatile.
However, I do put my money into Bitcoin because of my ideology first, and everything else comes second. Because if the ideology isn't there, there won't be a store of value. Luckily I think it is, because anytime someone brings up a hard-fork of changing Bitcoin to be created to an indefinite number rather than the ~21 million, it's rapidly shut-down (phew!).
Bitcoin was born out of ideology, is sustained by ideology, and will only grow by ideology. There will be those who will jump on the bandwagon simply because it's popular, which is fine. We only need a small percentage of core adoption before mass adoption becomes inevitable (because people will just use it regardless of ideology when it's the de facto payment system).
An interesting question is, can Bitcoin become the de facto payment system in the future as in mass adoption, if there is no mass conversion to the concepts of the ideology as well?
Probably yes, I think. Look at the web for example.
Tim Berners Lee invented the web on a foundation of principles or an ideology of a free/liberal and interconnected web of information and believed in some heavy concepts that most people (average consumer) did not give a damn about.
But eventually, it hooked onto the core early adopters. And it blossomed. It's kind of ugly now, with all the corporate nonsense piled on it, and now they're talking about net neutrality issues. But at least the web is pretty much the exact same technology that was born. And the same principles live on Google and Wikipedia and so on.
I believe in a similar future for Bitcoin.
What you say makes sense, and it helps me understand the whole context of things. It's useful to me to know what you think.
Perhaps you are a secondary level adopter. And you seem to be very early to the game here. You don't care about the originating principles, but you still want to use it. That is fair, and that is cool. And maybe what I am hoping for is that, since Bitcoin is still so new, that people will stay focused on the ideology - that it would be better for the world to have something like Bitcoin become dominant, just like Tim Berners Lee felt the world would be better with the World Wide Web.

Steve Job's goal of making a computer as common in the household as a toaster has its merits.
I think there are plenty of incentives to building an accessible system for Bitcoin and with the next generation of VCs funding all sort of things Bitcoin, I believe it is bound to happen. When Bitcoin becomes boring and commonplace, we've won.

Yes, you can run a full node without opening ports.
If you want to contribute to the network as well, you can do this without opening up a port on your home router, and instead, open a port on a separate server. How you do this will vary in cost depending on what you have access to. 
The idea, though, is a simple SSH tunnel that will push traffic that comes in on the external server's port 8333 to your server.
You can read more about it on the web, just search for SSH tunneling (and reverse tunnels).

This isn't related, but something I wish existed was a place where we could discuss World Events and News in relation to Bitcoin.
For example, if a country like Argentina has a new article about it's currency falling apart, I can't discuss that on r/Bitcoin because the article doesn't mention Bitcoin.
But I would like to discuss how Bitcoin can affect them and various ways Bitcoin users in Argentina are reacting to the news.
Or another example, the US Federal Reserve decides to increase interest rates by 0.50 points. That article again doesn't mention Bitcoin, but it would be cool to discuss that in relation to Bitcoin.
Basically, there are tons of things that I would love to discuss and it's relationship to Bitcoin, but there's no good place for it. If I bring up Bitcoin on other news sites, I get yelled at for trying to discuss an underground drug currency, and if I bring up the news on r/Bitcoin then I get yelled at for trying to discuss an article that doesn't mention Bitcoin.
Can we make a cool place to discuss stuff like this?

Democracy 2.0.
The original version got a lot of things right, but some things wrong as well. The idea of small government is great. Also, need to formally declare the boundaries of monetary powers. The government should not have the power to create money, but rather, bonds could be sold and taxes raised in case it becomes necessary to do so. Make it explicitly clear that no entity like the Fed can operate and mess with the money supply. Allow open, competing currencies. A couple things with voting, I think we should ensure that the way congress votes should be private rather than public, to prevent being pressured by big money lobbyists. Also, voting should be cryptographically verifiable, ensuring that there was no fraud involved. It might be a good idea to think about how to balance voting rights with intelligence somehow, but that is a tricky one. The problem with equal voting rights is that one person's complete ignorance counts just as much as another person's deep intelligence. That is unfortunate. I'm sure there is some solution though, that isn't perfect, but a little more ideal.
Education is a big one, and I believe it's the foundation of a working democracy (2.0) that has degraded to garbage levels ever since public education was invented. It worked a little bit at the beginning (just like socialism can work at the beginning) but long term, it degrades. Private education is key, as competition drives higher quality with cheaper/fewer resources, as every other highly improved industry operates (think: computer industry's spectacular advances, cheaper and higher quality products every year). So it needs to be made spectacularly and explicitly clear in the constitution that the government cannot get involved in education.
Also, term limits for congress. Hmm... I think this response is getting too long. I guess I'm saying that I was being sarcastic that democracy sucks, but it's this version 1.0 of democracy that sucks. Which is actually democracy 1.5 or so because it's nothing like the original democracy built by the founding fathers. So it's time for a rewrite, and make it bad-ass from everything we've learned and all the bugs we've found.

Some people say fiat is "backed by the government" but what is government? A collection of people who (ideally) are representing the people and serving the people. So it's backed by ourselves?
Or are we saying it's backed by the barrel of a gun? So if you don't accept it's value, you will have a metaphorical gun pointed at your face or accept jail time? So it's backed by brute force?
Either way, Bitcoin seems like a simpler, more trustworthy, more peaceful solution for money.

Remember, bitcoin is a protocol. It is defined by mathematics. You cannot ban mathematics any more than you can ban the law of physics.
Unfortunately, if a bunch of idiot lawmakers don't understand it and determine that playing with numbers is "black magic" that is only for witches and decide to burn you at the stake, well then it would be effective in making everyone fear it and avoid it out in public.
The unfortunate social behaviors of human beings are such that the total collective intelligence is so low that a self-governed people is destined to be idiotic. When we rely on others, we tend to do less for ourselves. And when everyone is relying on everyone else, nobody ends up doing anything.
Eventually, though, the idiotocracy reaches such a mind-numbingly horrible low that even the idiots see how idiotic the system is, at which point society bounces back in a new found "enlightenment". Things get better again, but the cycle repeats itself.
And this continues until human beings have absorbed every last resource on earth and dies from destroying the planet. At which point, an alien race stops by and realizes the gold mine of bitcoins left behind by humans, and they take them all away to their moon.

Yes that is fair enough. Needed to start somewhere. But do we still need people pumping up and hyping the price now? I feel like all the speculation does is attract people who are looking to make a quick profit, and end up crashing the whole thing before the system becomes useful for those "use cases for which we're still undervalued".
We went to $1000+, then crashed down to $300. I almost feel like it would have been cooler if we just stayed at $300 the whole time to begin with. Maybe then the news would have focused more on growing adoption and use, rather than growing price.
I dunno, you are probably right so don't take me too seriously here.

The price of Bitcoin units is not the same or as interesting as the technology of Bitcoin. Speculation about Bitcoins being worth $4 million only serves to draw in more gamblers rather than true enthusiasts. If the price grows to $4 million due to *real* user-adoption then it's a mere side-effect of something far more important going on.
I don't want Bitcoin to be all about scamming the next guy to buy some more, hyping up the price, and getting rich on that. I want it to be about real legitimate growth - true consumer and merchant adoption. True acceptance by everyone as a day-to-day currency and store-of-value.
If you're buying Bitcoins because you think you're going to be rich later, you're seriously missing the point - and try to be honest with yourself. Greed is natural, but know you're not really helping Bitcoin growth (technology, adoption, usability) all that much when you merely buy Bitcoin units.
When you think about it, who has helped Bitcoin more? The Winklevii or the various enthusiasts who brought you Blockchain.Info, Coinbase, or Mycellium?
And I would like to think that if you put that same money you would have spent speculating on Bitcoin units and rather put it in some solid potential Bitcoin ventures/startups, your upside might be even bigger than any profit in Bitcoin units could ever bring.

According to [bitnodes]( there are currently about 6400 global nodes. That is, people running full clients.
I would say that's roughly how many people hold bitcoins. There are some people who might use a web wallet or thin client, but this should give you an idea of how many computers are running the client. It could be 2x or 3x that number, but I wouldn't think it's 10x. That would be a bit extreme. So maybe 64,000 unique bitcoin holders. 
I know there's 149,000+ readers on here, but I think that's mostly just people who are curious but haven't bought any yet. I know a lot of people who are very unsure about bitcoin.

There is a saying that even if you reset the wealth of everyone in the world back to 0, the same people would eventually become rich again.
It's what the rich know, and their ability to make money. That keeps them powerful and that keeps them staying the 1%.
So if you want to change that, you will want to not worry so much about having Bitcoin, but start thinking about what it takes to earn Bitcoin.
As a hint, let me tell you that one thing that many rich people know how to do is invest in the right technologies at the right time.
I agree, you should hold your Bitcoins. But I ask two things from you:
* 1. Consider that it's not the number of Bitcoins you have but rather how you can invest and grow any Bitcoins you have.
* 2. Consider that it's not the biased accumulation of wealth that hurts the poor people, but rather the ability to corruptly manipulate money (or create money in the case of the Federal Reserve and Bank Bail-Outs) that hurts the poor people the most.
In an honest economy, real innovation and hard work will be rewarded, not lobbying, scheming, and counterfeiting.

If the SEC sites uncertainty around hardforks, they don't understand what kind of significant lead Bitcoin has over all other altcoins which have popped up throughout it's history.
The threat of hardforks is precisely what makes Bitcoin stronger. Currently, though, the threat is massively overstated (probably because of financial incentives of owning an altcoin like BU).
I hope the SEC can see right through nonsense like that.

Bitpay probably has the liquid balance of BTC to be able to handle large merchant purchases without dealing with volatility.
I don't know if the UK has it, but circle or coinbase would work well for the customer.
Once they have their Bitcoins, they can use either their laptop or their cellphone to transfer the BTC.
It would be good to have a trusted, experienced friend help you and the customer in this process. Last thing you want is to mess up a big transaction. There are probably many good people at a UK Bitcoin meetup who might even volunteer to do this for you free, for the sake of the community. However, once you get the hang of it, transferring $1 isn't that much different from $100,000. It's all just BTC.

Settlement network
It will always take more effort, hashing power, machines, electricity to secure by means of distributed trust.
Centralized trust is super fast, but exploitable.
Centralization fees are high because of market dominance, greed, and capability. But they can be lowered and still function. Decentralization fees are high because mining is high and demand for security is high. It can't be lowered so gracefully. Need significant engineering efforts.

A decentralized payments solution will NEVER be as efficient and cost-effective as a centralized payments solution (e.g. VISA). I don't think "wide acceptance" is really an interesting goal, at all.
If Bitcoin is meant instead to replace government currency, it could become the backbone of financial transactions. It could also become one of the best asset classes for long-term savings, like gold and silver. But even these historically valued assets are not "widely adopted" by the public. The public is either:
1. Too poor to own gold, silver, or bitcoin.
2. Too short-sighted to consider long-term appreciation.
3. Prefer fiat because it's spendable - where gold, silver, and bitcoin are very difficult to spend.
I think a successful bitcoin is one where it does become $200,000 per bitcoin but the "average joe" simply doesn't care or use it directly. It backs all the major financial transactions and banks, and "non-average jane" who actually cares about long-term savings.
I'm happy with Bitcoin, the progress it's making. I'm not worried about high fees (in fact, maybe that is a good thing -- we can stop "dice" spam -- and encourage side chaining). I don't need a VISA replacement because I never had an issue with payments.
But I've ALWAYS had an issue with money that is not truly my own. The US dollar, is the US Government's dollar, which is loaned to me, and taken away at their whim. That is a real problem, that Bitcoin solves.

I think even if the money can be withdrawn at all times, that doesn't really prove that some fake "trades" were not made to pump the system. Those fake trades don't affect the balance sheet.
Would it be possible to audit an exchange by having the exchange publish each trade to a 3rd party auditor which has stores all trades and trader profiles independently?
So let's say in order to use a hypothetical exchange "Bitstump" there would be an independent 3rd party auditing service "Checkstump" (could be more than one, for even more protection) linked to account registration and exchanges. This would be done via secure API.
This auditing service wouldn't be able to control anything, but can take the complete history of exchange for all users and determine if the daily published price by the exchange was indeed accurate based on the trades being made. And not some funky monkey number made up out of thin air.
Every user on Bitstump could authenticate and login to Checkstump and see their own transactions being listed as part of the calculations. If a Bitstump user sees a discrepancy in what they traded on Bitstump and what Checkstump shows, that could raise a red flag in potential Bitstump price reporting fraud.
Problem with this I see off the bat is that not all users will bother going in and verifying that the Checkstump report matches up with their Bitstump trades.
Second problem is, Bitstump could create a fake buyer and fake seller on Bitstump who trade BTC for a fake price say $999 and that would still be verified on Checkstump without any red flags. And their balance sheet and withdrawal liquidity would remain exactly the same. The only thing that changed was the perceived price.
The identity problem is an old one though, and Google has been trying to solve that one for years. How can we verify that someone is a real person and not a duplicate or a fake? And do it in a way that preserves their privacy? (I don't like the idea of doing this with Government Issued IDs).

Until Bitcoin becomes a defacto currency for common transactions, I hold my value in Bitcoin until it's time to make a purchase. Then, I convert at that moment, and buy something.
You can think of that as "buying, holding, and taking profit in terms of a purchase" but I think that's a very old-fashioned way of looking at it.
For me, fiat dollars are basically coupons that expire over time. I don't want to risk buying a bunch of coupons that I may not use, and in fact, become riskier since they lose value.
Eventually, if enough people are seeing it the same way, then the person receiving the money also then converts it back to Bitcoin. And then the two parties say, "hey we don't need to use these coupons as an intermediary - let's just exchange Bitcoin directly" and that's when the coupons really start to become meaningless.
So it might feel like people are just "buying, holding, and taking profit" but what's actually happening is, they are completing one side of the gradual conversion to fully use Bitcoin as a defacto currency. When it tips, and Bitcoin is the standard currency of the world, and we don't need coupons, then you'll probably stop thinking of "buying and holding Bitcoin as investing" just like you probably don't think of "buying and holding Dollars as investing" right now.

Speculation leads to disaster. Success would depend on perception of Bitcoin. A gamble.
Bitcoin is a liquid hedge against inflation - which it accomplishes the very second you own some by the nature of the current protocol. That part is not a gamble, but a mathematical fact. Mining is cryptographically secure and cannot be fraudulently changed by people.
Of course, the value could still go down if there really is a flaw in the protocol. And the value can go down due to other people speculating on it (and dumping it). But other people can't change the protocol. And if they did change a really important part of it, you should probably stop using Bitcoin.
Speculators want Bitcoin to reach $100k per coin from how "popular" it will get from things like ease-of-use and global acceptance. It is meant to "get rich".
Non-speculators are protecting themselves when Bitcoin reaches $100k per coin from the simple fact that $100k becomes worthless. It is meant to "retain wealth".
Personally, I don't care if it's popular or mainstream. In fact, the more mainstream it gets due to hype and greed - the more volatile and annoying Bitcoin becomes.
In other words, I think that if Bitcoin does become mainstream, it will do so out of necessity, not out of choice. When the only way to preserve your hard earned money is to use Bitcoin, and every other alternative means possibly not being able to buy groceries next week or next month, everyone will have to use Bitcoin otherwise starve to death. This might sound like an extreme "only-in-socialist-Venezuela" type of situation you can't fathom in the U.S. but history will unfold itself and doesn't care whether something is fathomable or not. In hindsight, after the shit hits the fan, it will seem as obvious as the factors leading up to the "subprime mortgage crash". That nightmare situation seems perfectly predictable - of course people who can't afford to be buying a house shouldn't be buying a house! Was it really a surprise?
So if the government keeps inflating the dollar, will it really be a surprise that it eventually becomes completely worthless? Does it really take a economic PhD to figure that out?
I think it's great to keep educating people about it and explaining to people the value of saving money. But that's not easy because we've had several generations of people seeing their savings disappear due to inflation and it's not an easily correctable habit. We've had so much unbridled spending and excessive waste and bubble-causing mentalities that it's really going to take a lot of time.
But when the dollar really starts falling apart, people will be begging you to teach them about Bitcoin. And the education and popularization of Bitcoin becomes ridiculously easy and fast. The more people are desperate to need the features of Bitcoin, the more they will want it.
Currently, some areas around the world actually need it more desperately than others. China with currency controls and Venezuela with hyperinflation. These places need it way more than some girl in New York buying a Starbucks with a Visa credit card that works 100% perfectly fine.
We'll see what happens.

Yeah exactly.
So why do people trust any of this? Especially with zero regulation (which I'm not a fan of necessarily). I think a lot of the reason the price is what it is, is because people who bought at any any given price has decided to be a long term holder and refuse to back down from it. Not that they are "certain" it's worth the price they bought it at. If we have enough people like that, it creates a price bottom in the market. But it's kind of built on nothing. On top of that, if we have manipulation and spoofed trades, the price really seems kind of nonsensical.
Is this the problem that decentralized exchanges attempt to solve?

When you say exchanges don't report the price, people are not trading blindly, making up a random value to trade at. They look at what the majority of trades at happening at and then decide if they want to participate by making an offer relative to overall market pricing.
Willingness to trade at a given price has a LOT to do with what other people are trading at. Maybe I think the value should be $260 right now. But my offer to buy at that price will largely be ignored when sellers can presumably get $600 for it now due to "reported exchange prices". 
It does not matter how many news agencies or aggregate averages we have repeating an illegitimate price - it doesn't magically make it more legitimate.
I'm not saying any given price isn't accurately depicting what some people might think is a fair market value. I'm saying that what protections do we have that those people are not simply being manipulated to make those real trades by false prices.

Average person has a terrible sense of what is expensive or not.
What makes anyone think $500 or $5000 or $50000 expensive? Is it purely based on what your income and budget is for investing?
It's the same reason people think GOOG is too expensive, when in fact, they simply choose not to do as many stock splits. It confuses people, which is kind of sad.
The value of the Bitcoin is almost immeasurable because we don't have anything that even comes close. If you wanted to hold some value, that cannot be confiscated by government, either by force or inflation, and cannot be counterfeited, what options do you really have? ZERO. Except a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.
For me, that can't even be measured in dollars. And measured in work-effort, I would simply say it's worth 100% of all my work-effort in life. Dollars are worth little, maybe nothing at all.
Since there is no amount of USD that I'd rather have than Bitcoin, we can say it's worth $INFINITY. And is "$INFINITY" too "expensive" for Bitcoin? I think it's about the right price for me, as far as I'm concerned.
But as it goes to $INFINITY, people will keep complaining that the price is too high. While they watch their dollars plummet to worthless pieces of paper.

Because it's difficult to prove that any of the reporting is "correct" given the pseudoanonymous nature of wallets you may have transferred funds to without association of a name, the IRS will assume that you own the address and sold it for profit unless you can find the person and otherwise prove the transfers with the recipient claiming ownership. At which point, the IRS can follow the trail to that person, and so on.
People who are not keeping meticulous records with detailed contact information for where the money went will need to assume the full tax consequences as if you sold the Bitcoins at the highest possible price. And whether you did or didn't, you'll be owing some huge amounts of tax which you potentially can't even afford because you DID sell it at a loss but not able to prove it. It becomes a federal criminal case if you try to fight it, and getting lawyers would be hugely expensive as well.
Using Coinbase is shooting yourself in the foot. You've the forfeited anonymity and protections that Bitcoin provides.
However, if the only thing you did with your Bitcoin was just buy and sell within Coinbase, and never transferred it outside of it, reporting it might actually be do-able. But everything else is a nightmare. Once the IRS receives detailed account and transaction history of all of it's users, they can audit everyone particularly those with large sums.
Be warned, folks!

That's not how inflation works.
Starting a new independent ledger from a shared history just means it's a new ledger. You can choose to follow the first, the second, or both, but they are meaningless compared to each other.
For true inflation, you would have to magically give value to one of the ledgers. You could do that by saying everyone gets a magic transaction of X coins from nobody to themselves. That is currency that came from nowhere.
In this fork, nobody created currency from nowhere. The record-keeping is still accurate. The value is divided, but there is no inflation.

Why "a lot more"? A large Chinese exchange run by one or two people could easily report on their own site that a bunch of people are making trades at $1000 per Bitcoin. When people see this fake price, it can cause real trades to happen at around that price. Which then propagates to other exchanges around the world.
Chinese exchange prices are certainly affecting other global exchanges. I worry that there's no easy to know the validity of the movement.

It's really simple, but complex to predict.
If some guy is desperate to buy drugs on the dark net, he may be willing to buy bitcoin for $4000 a piece. If another guy believes in Bitcoin Crash, they might be willing to sell bitcoin for $100 a piece. Markets fluctuate based on beliefs and needs, and ultimately settle at some value where most the trade is actually happening.
It's really not much more than that.

BitPay is financially incentivized to support a more centralized cryptocurrency controlled by BitPay's partners. A centralized cryptocurrency is just a fancy "Paypal alternative". It completely misses the point of bitcoin, and you should wonder what the point of using bitcoin is at all, if it's controlled by a few companies.
Nevertheless, Bitpay has the freedom to make this choice. They could stop supporting all cryptocurrency and switch to only supporting Visa/MC and Paypal if they wanted to. But all other coins are inferior in my opinion, because they are not as open, not as decentralized, and not backed by some of the brightest cryptcurrency engineers in the whole world.
There will be many fork-based attacks on bitcoin, but think about it -- why would you fork rather than just move your money to another coin if you didn't like bitcoin? 
Answer: power. You want power to change what happens to OTHER people's money. I'm sorry, but that's bad and wrong. You, or BitPay, or Circle, or the Government, or the Mafia should NEVER have the power to change what your money is worth. That is how wealth is stolen.
And so far, Bitcoin is proving to be safe against fork-based attacks.
So in summary, carry on. Don't use Bitpay. Know your Bitcoin is secure. And ignore forks, if not at least use them as an opportunity to get more free Bitcoin by selling the forked coins.

The idea is kind of how the blockchain protects against changing transaction history. It is protected by mining. If someone tried to change the rules (that is not backwards compatible), they would have to re-hash the entire blockchain from scratch. It would be hard to find the correct versioned hash, because it would be encrypted by the private key. They could alternatively ignore the hash, but they lose the security of it and would have to go through a lot of work to "copy" the chain. They could also ignore it and not bother to rehash the versioning, but then you are left with a less-secure hard-fork (not much different from just copying all the X-&gt;Y transaction values into an DB and saying "this is my new coin's official ledger"). Zero security, and not even worth considering as a real hard fork.

Fractions are not different from whole bitcoins in terms of how they get used. At any time you can combine 0.0005 BTC with 0.0001 BTC with 3,000 BTC with 0.00000001 BTC. They are just numbers, like on a spreadsheet. Selling fractions is no different than whole bitcoins. In fact, very few people deal with whole bitcoins, because transaction fees tend to change 1 BTC to something like 0.99995 BTC right away.
Once you get used to it, you'll be trading fractions of BTC like it's no big deal.

This is a new technology, and the reason why the fees are high is because it's an extremely popular technology where everyone is willing to pay those high fees.
That being said, fees shouldn't have to be so high, so with Segwit now being activated, and more services+infrastructure starting to use it, you'll see fees slowly coming down on the main chain AND/OR you won't even need to use the main chain as you'll be able to complete your transactions over the LN.
Right now, using LTC or Venmo is a better payment method. BTC isn't ONLY about payments. Otherwise, why would you ever want bitcoin in the first place?
BTC is ALSO about storing value protected from government inflation. And that has a lot of value, too. Don't assume it's nothing.

It's important to understand the difference between speculation and usage demand.
Under normal circumstances, Bitcoin rises simply due to usage demand. Since supply is limited, and people use Bitcoin as a store of long-term value, the price rises. And, as Bitcoin becomes a better means of transaction (either legal or illegal), the price rises. These are healthy, normal rises in value simply due to the fact that Bitcoin is precious and rare.
However, there are less healthy rises where Bitcoin simply goes up because people think it is going up. This is speculation. The problem with speculative bubbles is that they are not backed by real usage, other than people's emotions, hunches, and gut-feelings. These are actually kind of worthless.
And so, eventually the tide changes - which usually happens when the rise starts to stall, and fear takes over. And as fear creates more fear, money starts to leave -- and the price is corrected back to the normal level. Usually it corrects back to a level BELOW the normal level.
And so, it swings. 
But regardless of the swings, if you're a long-term holder, and you avoid trading with emotions, and you ignore the noise, then you can do fine. Don't let fear or greed take over your actions. Trust that Bitcoin is secure, and that it's value will continue to rise as long as world governments continue to waste the wealth of world nations.

It's not scaling when you exclude even more node operators.
Again, if you just want the highest TPS you should just run it on a single trusted centralized database. What is your objective? If you're fine with excluding people, why not exclude everyone and be a single source of truth of all transactions?
Blocksize increasing is not ability to scale, it's a tradeoff to centralize and require more trust in the system such that you get more transactions per second.

I think you should ask how does running a full node help yourself, first.
Running a node means you're an essential participant in ensuring that nobody is defrauding the system.
Running a node means that your system is validating blocks, and that the transaction history can be trusted, so YOU personally know it, mathematically and by how the software operates.
You don't have to trust a bank or 3rd party to do that.
It's THE foundation to bitcoin. It's sort of like, how does being able to check my bank account balance help the banks? Well, it should be more about helping yourself, to make sure the bank isn't screwing you. And in the same way, running a node is a way to ensure miners or other node operators are not screwing you.

Does not concern me at all.
These "bank-owned" cryptocurrencies is what has already existed for decades. Government fiat has long been digital, and cryptographically secured to a various degree already. Adding more cryptographic security on top of that does nothing to change the fundamental problem with it. The way banks are able to pull off fractional reserve banking has a lot to do with the fact that it's already digital money. They just magically say "I am transferring $10,000 into John's account" which is just a digital ledger with absolutely nothing backing it up or preventing them from adding a few extra 0's since it's all just numbers written in a computer.
The problem solved by Bitcoin is the fact that there needs not be a single organization that holds the power to steal your money. The rules of the protocol state that there is a fixed amount of halving, a fixed number of blocks mined, a fixed total amount of Bitcoin ever to be possible.
And as long as the system continues to abide by these rules, Bitcoin can be used. If the protocol changes, people will exit in massive fashion and they should be able to with enough time since the ownership is decentralized and protocol changes would have to propagate to a bunch of nodes. People will either move their money away to another currency, or stick to the last version they were actually happy with.
The reason for Bitcoin's attractiveness is not primarily that it's merely digital. Or merely secure. It's that it gives people ownership of their money.
A bank-based "cryptocurrency" does not give people ownership of their money.

It's simple mathematics. If you look at average home internet speeds around the world, you'll see that if you increase the block size it will require a non-linear increase in bandwidth which will inevitably mean that those with less access to high speed internet become excluded from participation.
Why would you want to do this?
On the other hand, I would support decreasing the block size in order to make it MORE accessible to people around the world -- if it didn't require a hard fork. I'm sick and tired of centralized governments and banks trying to take away my hard earned money. But hard forks are nasty business, so I'm fine with the 1 MB block size.
Do I want lower fees? Sure, but never at the sacrifice of the ability for me and you and as many people on the planet to have access to bitcoin. And there are technically superior solutions that are far more long-term and achieve low fees.

And if I sell off one, I have MORE of the actual coin. That is, selling BCH means I have MORE BTC than before in equivalent $ holdings (assuming no price fluctuations).
In outcome 2, 3, 4, ... (with ANY alt-coin, BCH included) I am dead. You are right. But I was never interested in any other alt-coin, and was *FORCED* into this situation by other coin holders (BCH supporters). This was an attack, against my will.

Why does it make sense? Hard Forks are incredibly messy propositions. The way the BCash hard fork has happened is an example of how horrible and complex they can be. It would be risky, and there may be a bunch of people (nodes, miners) who decide to stay on 1x. It's very hard to move EVERYONE or even a vast majority of everyone, unless it's very clear cut (aka bug fix).
So, why NOT rely on a soft fork like segwit that doesn't force everyone to upgrade, and gives us the scaling we need?
So I say, screw 2x and any other attempt to hard fork and automatically try to move me. It's my coin, and I'm not a fan of anyone (whether it's core, bitmain, my neighbor, the government, the bank) trying to tell me to run a different protocol/coin.

Not sure that makes any sense. "2X" is a political tool rather than a technical one.

This applies to any feature of Bitcoin that is potentially hazardous. You have to understand that it's divisive, and it's not about making unilateral protocol decisions by democratic vote. Bitcoin loses technical followers every time a non-technical bad decision is made, and the community isn't "healed" by 2X rather factions are merely replaced internally.

There are thousands out there.
But what you should really care about is whether they are playing fair against your own wallet.
And you can do that by running 1 node. And 1 node is enough to make sure miners are playing fair, for your personal intents and purposes.
Now, how many represent a healthy network? Thousands is good, tens of thousands would probably be better. But that isn't as important as your individual ability to not need to trust and thus not be defrauded.

But unlike other altcoins, I have to sell BCash because otherwise I'm propping up it's value by holding them. And it's something I don't believe in.
Just like I'm propping up a corrupt financial system if I was forced to own dollars.
Newly created alt-coins starting from scratch can just be ignored, and doesn't have any value.
So I'm talking about preventing usable copies of the existing transaction history (we'll call them "ABC"s for auxiliary block chains). Today, an ABC can be created because it doesn't have to change old transactions. But, it would be nice to make it more difficult for ABCs to be created somehow.

As a node operator, I have no desire to run something that will eat even more bandwidth than a 1 MB blocksize requires -- which is very demanding even on a residential DSL line in a major US city.
So even if 2 MB or 8 MB chains survive, and have some level of support, they are no more interesting than Litecoin or any other alt-coin out there.
I will trust only the most decentralized currency. If I wanted another PayPal, I would have just used PayPal.

Hi! Thanks for participating in r/bitcoin, we like hearing from everyone. However, posts about slow transactions have been posted ad nauseum. Bitcoin transactions are slow right now due to an ongoing attack. This should end when the attacker, spamming transactions, runs out of money. These types of attacks are very expensive, so you should expect that it will not last too long. Keep an eye on  and the number of days until BTC is the more profitable chain. Then, transactions should settle quickly as normal. Not much to worry about, just a few small delays in a planet-wide system.

I would just use mycelium on both sides.
1. Buy BTC for cash Euros in person from someone. 0 fees.(*)
2. Then your wife could use the exact same Mycelium account (or a different one) and then, 
3. Sell BTC for cash USDs again in person from someone.(*)
4. Voila, done.
(*)Most buyers/sellers put a % markup on exchange-based prices, so you're sort of paying a fee. And then there's the microfee in Bitcoin but that could be potentially less than 0.01 Euro.
However, if you're including Official Banks anywhere in this process, it becomes 10X more annoying. Banks will ask where this cash is coming from, etc. Governments will want to tax you. Anything associated to banks is awful. If your end goal is to get it into your wife's Official Bank account, you might as well just bite the 4% bullet with paypal.
And if you need the money fast, I don't know how effective Mycelium would be, all depends on how many buyers and sellers there are locally.
You can have it:
1. Easy
2. Cheap
3. Fast
Pick any two.

Before you trade, check  and see whether miners are currently on BTC or on BCH. If they are on BCH (that is, it's more profitable to mine) then wait until the day they switch. The estimated switch date is shown on the page as well.
When the switch happens, fees come back to the .02 cents you used to pay.
Until BCH is dead, hopefully soon, you have to keep an eye on when you trade.

If you're using a recent version of Electrum, you can do stuff like child-pays-for-parent and replace-by-fee. These are probably new terms to you, and it can be confusing to learn about the details, but in the end, you can think of them as just ways of increasing the fees after you've already sent a transaction in order to push them through faster.
But right now, miners have temporarily switched to BCH (~2 days before they switch back as of right now).


So, you can wait until then and you'll see the transaction go through.
If you don't want to wait, you'll have to look into those other options.
You should be fine to wait a while unless this is an emergency.

You say "no sane person", but I feel like most people around the world have absolutely no issue with the fact that it does exist today. And most people continue to stay busy with their lives, without a care for about it.
I love Bitcoin but I am 100% afraid that in the end, we'll all end up in the exact same place because AVERAGE PEOPLE simply don't have the principles needed to demand proof-of-reserves. 
I have huge amount of trust in Bitcoin, and almost zero trust in people. And I am almost sure that people will disappoint me in the future, and that there WILL BE places using Bitcoin with fractional reserve, and that will be inevitable.
BUT, despite that problem, fractional reserve won't be part of the protocol. So, at least MY OWN PERSONAL wealth cannot be diminished. What will happen to those using "ReserveCoin" will be that eventually their coins will become extremely worthless, while my Bitcoin will become worth a TON of ReserveCoin (and worth REAL VALUE, regardless of exchange rate).
So that's why I am expecting to be disappointed by People and ready for when that time comes by holding on to MY BITCOIN and not relying on people.
And yes, this breaks down the promise of a Bitcoin utopia where governments are not shady and people are not poor, but that's fine, because average people are simply not smart enough to maintain such a system. And now if you don't want to get slaughtered by the system, you have to watch your own back and can't always care about society. Society keeps wanting to doom itself.

Yeah, I would 100% run a miner in this scenario. I'd basically be donating electricity, but donating to a cause I actually care about. Yeah profit is good, but I'm sick of government control of money and the abuse, war, and poverty that stems from it. It would feel good, and since there would be less mining competition, it would actually have an impact on the network.
Do we really need 1000's of Petahashes/sec? It doesn't improve TPS (transactions per second) at all, and is so wasteful in my opinion. People say it makes the network more secure, but I posit that a profit motive creates more centralization and thus makes it less secure.

He didn't say how much he was going to transfer. If he's doing a $2,500,000 cash deposit or wire, there will probably be questions asked. The currency conversion itself will take a huge % because it will be based on the amount being transferred. And some Banks do a wire charge based on the amount as well. Who knows. If he's lucky and it's a small amount, maybe the wire transfer will be cheap.

Yeah, I argued that profitable mining was unnecessary and that Bitcoin was just as effective as a currency when it cost 10,000 BTC to buy a pizza. Where you put the decimal point isn't a big deal to me. Making mining profitable, if anything, only deflated the currency quicker. A few years ago, I proposed a system that closer resembles the open-source model: Linux is extremely successful due to enthusiasts and hobbyists wanting a better OS in their own vision. In the same way, I believe that there are enough technolibetarians and hacktivists to support an ecosystem of a currency that is better and supported by a natural desire for a replacement of the status quo: without ANY incentive, other than making the world a better place.
I believe this system would be even more eco-friendly than this ridiculous mining farms that people are building and only someone insanely passionate about this "free-mined" coins would even bother to build such a system.
Anyways, I haven't gotten around to coding and releasing this alt-coin, but just remember that most people used to laugh about open source, that it would never be anything more significant than a niche for hobbyists and never be used in the real-world to a large scale. Today, open source and all this freely contributed code is possibly some of the most important and widely used software in the world from Android, to Apache, to Linux, to GCC, and the list goes on and on.

Mempool is still a bit clogged up from recent spam activity combined with short-term loss of mining power. But, looks like we're back up at full power, and transaction fees are dropping very fast.
Right now, 100 sat/byte seems solid.
In the future, I'm expecting alt-coin nonsense to diminish and LN (or other technologies) to accelerate Bitcoin transactions.

This topic comes up every few months. Look at all the previous threads. We don't need to "standardize" anything. Do we standardize everything on one gram? No. We use whatever makes sense. kg, mg, etc. for what we're trying to measure at the time.
For small things like measuring fees, satoshi/byte is fine.
For big things like houses, whole bitcoins are fine.
No need to "standardize".

This doesn't make any more eco sense. You'll have people buying billions of hard drives, and drive manufacturers that build insane storage systems, and all these will be wasted for nothing. Electricity is a first order measure. Hard drives are built using electricity ... or energy of the machines, people, lights, etc that is used to make even one hard drive. It will always be a matter of electricity and going by storage means it's a second order measure. And using hard drives will never be as efficient as raw electricity. It's the same as solar panels will never create more electricity than the sun light directed at it.

I hope you're just misunderstanding the mathematics here, and not trolling.
Giving you the benefit of the doubt, the solution is pretty simple: smaller units.
There was a time when gold coins was standard for paying for things. But, gold became so valuable, you couldn't buy groceries with it anymore. But you still had gold coins, so they broke it down into smaller coins.
But eventually, these are too hard to manage, so they starting using mixed metal coins. 1 cheap metal + a small percentage of real gold.
And you can shrink this down to 0.01% of gold per coin if you needed to, without trying to sprinkle magic fairy dust on someone to pay for a coffee.
Of course, physical money has these limits.
Digital money can break down to 0.00000000000001% of a Bitcoin and there would be absolutely NO problem with it. Things would function nice and cleanly. And we won't SPECIFY all these digits.
We'll have a unit called "something" that represents that amount of Bitcoin. Let's call that unit one "naught". And we can trade 50 digital naughts for 1 banana. No problem.
There will never be a problem of "not enough bitcoins to go around" because we can split them up infinitely smaller.

Deflationary is more realistic in the end, because we live in a world of finite resources. Finite energy, finite time, finite land, finite water/air. When we have a monetary system that treats this limited planet as if it was infinite, we have a system that produces huge amounts of waste (think of people buying things for no reason other than their money is worth less over time) and expending resources that don't actually exist. This creates a temporary disconnect between the actual value that exists in the world, and the money that represents it. In the end, it comes crashing down (after a bubble).

Pretty bad ideas you have there.
First of all, most media such as flash drives have a very limited shelf life. The keys may be lost easily after a year or two.
I offer you two methods: 
1) Traditional Legal Method (with a deposit box + lawyer):
You should store the Bitcoin seed on something permanent like a metal plate, then put it in a bank or other safe and guarded location.
When you sign up for that storage, they will often ask for beneficiary information. So, if a lawyer comes along later after you die, the bank will give the lawyer the keys (and the seed).
You should then find someone they can trust who will unlock the seed and help with the transfer (or sale, if they want to exchange the bitcoin for cash).
2) Automated script method:
Have a script that will ask you every year whether you're still alive. If you confirm that you're alive, nothing happens.
If you don't confirm, and after enough retry attempts, then it will automatically send emails to all your beneficiaries with instructions on how to claim your bitcoin holdings.
If you're interested in this scripted mechanism, let me know. I can give you more details.

Due to fractional reserve banking, every $1 in bitcoin removes hundreds if not thousands of dollars out of the debt-based system which rich bankers rely on.
It's a revolution that a lot of people don't even realize is going on, and it's not showing any signs of stopping.
It's too bad that too many people don't care, or don't realize it, or have learned to be overly skeptical of things without understanding it. They won't get to be a part of the changing hands of leadership.
Nevertheless, they will benefit. Because the new system won't be able to enslave them in the horrific way it's done today.
So people may never appreciate it, but you're silently and anonymously saving their asses.
And let the old, the corrupt, and the powerful feel what it really means to face a financial revolution.

It seems way too common of a mistake, and a terrible user interface. I don't blame users at all.

For us who remain on real bitcoin, we're working on _lightning network_ which is a magnitude faster, cheaper, and more private.

There's a big difference between today's obscene "banking system" that lends money it doesn't have and creates money out of thin air, and a classic "bank" where you store your money. Really, it would just be a safe deposit box. No funny business. If a bank wanted to lend money, it would need to receive such funds directly, but nobody should trust such a bank.
Unfortunately, the average person has been brainwashed into thinking most banks can be trusted.

Because people who have been struggling against monetary inflation will ultimately benefit from the disappearance of exploitative government-issued currencies. They might, in the short-term, lose all their value from hyperinflation. But, long-term, they will benefit from the replacement of that system, as it will no longer be able to exploit them.
Every time the government inflates a currency, wealth is stolen from that individual without permission.

Because the first rule of good personal finance is to be extremely resistant against any get-rich-quick type of scheme. Because the type of person who even needs to bother to browse personal finance is the type of person who would also probably fall for such schemes. The first lesson to such people should be to build a resistance against schemes.
Most people have gotten rich quick from Bitcoin. And will continue to do so. Even if it's a solid investment from an objective point of view, it's a horrible investment if you're trying to train people to get a hold of their finances. Because it will give them the habit of thinking other Bitcoin-like things are also good investments such as ICOs which are absolutely terrible but indistinguishable to the noob eye.

If Bitcoin is the familiar, safe, and usable alternative in the face of hyperinflation, I think it will happen pretty quickly. I think we're preparing for that event. If the barrier of entry for the average joe to protect themselves is easy (aka Coinbase) and Coinbase doesn't do any funnymoney accounting, then it will happen even faster with Coinbase around.
Coinbase does stand to "bank" a lot of people's money when that happens. But, the risks will be high and the viability of moving funds safely and securely off Coinbase will also hopefully be very reasonable. In which case, people stop taking unnecessary risk by delegating security of their money to Coinbase (or to government, or to anyone really) and own their money independently by withdrawing all their money from Coinbase.
And I'm not sure if that will all take a super-long time.
But here's the thing. There's no WAY in the world we can educate everyone about the safety of storing money in Bitcoin while the US dollar inflates into worthlessness.
So what will happen is that a good chunk ~20% of people will go into Bitcoin.
The remaining 80% of people will watch all their wealth/savings/income collapse into worthlessness and blame government, economists, etc. (basically everyone except themselves).
The government will obviously respond with an economic crisis aversion program, declare the country is in "depression" or whatever, and people will learn to become extremely frugal and become friends with as many farmers and independent people with skills, and barter will be much more useful.
But in this environment, barter is annoying, and anyone with any sense will see that while the dollar has become worthless, Bitcoin is stable as heck (or skyrocketing).
Then people will use it out of necessity, because the people bartering will be tired of trying to figure out if they really need all the items being offered and want to simplify everything.
And nobody needs Coinbase. Or US dollars. It's all Bitcoin.
Now, the people who are left who have any money (and hence power to lobby, power to elect, etc.) are people who own Bitcoin. With pressure from these Bitcoin-elevated new wealthy population, Government gives in, finally, and declares Bitcoin the official currency of the US. And other countries follow.
At least, that's how I saw it all go down in a dream once.

How do you determine surpass? "Market cap"?
If google issued their own cryptocurrency, it would probably instantly have a market cap 1000X bigger than bitcoin.
That's not really what matters.
What you should care about is survivability. There are millions of monetary instruments that have more value or "market cap" than bitcoin today. Real estate, gold, stocks, bonds, you name it. Whether some alternative "corporate coin" comes along and is big doesn't matter.
Especially if it's an alternative "government coin". If it has immediate parity by guarantee of the government then you could say it "surpassed" bitcoin. But I think that's a worthless measure.

Are you going to make a lot of money for advertising Coinbase and sending them referrals?
Secondly, why would Coinbase be the bank of the future, and not people themselves? What happened to "be your own bank"?
Coinbase, in my opinion, is a temporary stepping stone to get your old "dollars" out of the legacy system and into Bitcoin.
Once everyone has converted their money, Coinbase becomes obsolete.

I don't know if it counts, but I think the hype is constantly ignoring the legal challenges facing Bitcoin users.
People have varied opinions about the legality of buying and selling bitcoin, but the reality is those opinions don't matter if you fall on the wrong side of the law and you end up in a physical prison.
I really wish we could continue to have more discussion on this to stay grounded, rather than talk about price or hype or the next start-up. Because the old system is antiquated, the laws are incredibly intrusive to privacy and freedom (for the sake of "anti-terrorism"), not to mention all the legal advantages held by incumbent financial institutions.
I also have a terrible feeling whenever someone new is interested in Bitcoin and wants to buy Bitcoin, and isn't fully aware of the risks of becoming a target of the government for being caught for violating money transmission laws and ending up in prison. I feel like there isn't enough warning and education given to such newcomers.

I like the idea of these corporate monkey miners leaving decentralized Bitcoin and choosing to mine some worthless altcoin called B2X or S2X or NYABTC. We've needed a new rebalancing of mining power in Bitcoin. Clearly, there are companies who are attacking Bitcoin, wrestling power away from decentralized development, and trying to make it their own Paypal 2.0.
And they might be "successful" in their own way, such as how Venmo has been "successful" and Apple Pay has been "successful". But that means absolutely NOTHING to real Bitcoin users. It's just more of the corporate and banking and federal government crap that's been shoveled into our faces for centuries.
I no longer have a fear of such nonsense. I don't care if they are "widely adopted" any more than I care that today "Chase Bank" and "Wellsfargo" are widely adopted. These things will get CRUSHED long-term. I don't think that most people understand how resiliant and resistant Bitcoin truly is.
We're going to have hundreds, if not thousands of more S2X, S3X, S100X, BCH, Super Bitcoin, Mega Bitcoin, and others trying to attack and wrangle power away from Bitcoin.
What no alt-coin so far has done, is proven to me, from a purely TECHNICAL stand-point, that they are superior. They are massively inferior in terms of control and not to mention filled with absurd politicization of technical facts.
The reality is, large swaths of Bitcoin users joined the Bitcoin train. And we welcomed them, but they didn't give a fuck about decentralization. They cared about becoming the next big "Blockchain Startup" like Coinbase. They cared about following some cult-like "Bitcoin Jesus" and "Craig Satoshi Wright". They cared about becoming "PayPal 2.0" even if it meant giving up decentralization. They cared about their "Investment" like it was some kind of stock, and wanted it to go up, fuck principles and fuck all the reasons why Bitcoin exists or was initially adopted. They are happy to see it regulated, controlled, because they don't care about massive government abuse. They just see it as an opportunity to get rich.
And these "Bitcoin users" will simply quickly become "Non-Bitcoin users". But that doesn't mean Bitcoin has to change. It's a bunch of people who never believed or cared in Bitcoin, becoming interested in it, and then threatening to leave if it doesn't morph into a bastard coin of the miners/companies/government.
Good riddance. I, personally, will continue to HOLD my Bitcoin for the same reasons I ever became interested in the first place. True decentralization. Top-notch global crypto development team. Personal monetary control.

In theory, everything happens on your computer. So they don't have direct access to your coins.
Nevertheless, it's one of the worst places to store coins because so many people have been hacked.
Various ways it can be hacked:
* You connect to a phishing site that looks like b1ockchain.info
* A rogue employee adds a tiny piece of Javascript that secretly sends all the private keys to them.
* Someone hacks your email and/or phone or otherwise gets around the 2FA.
* Your computer is compromised, or your browser is compromised, or your SSL certs are compromised, or your keyboard is compromised, or your router, firewall, ... and so on.
Now, all systems have various vulnerabilities.
But blockchain.info is just notoriously bad, and has been hacked many times with no particular bad action on the user's part.
Good luck.

At various times, interesting social campaigns have been able to manipulate these results by having a lot of sites/blogs link a particular term to a particular site. 
For example:
In October 2012, searching the phrase "completely wrong" on Google images, returns pictures of Mitt Romney, the Republican Nominee for the U.S. Presidential Election in 2012.[55]

The site takes care of most of the communication, you just have to enter the buyer's items and shipping address. You receive the coins after the buyer confirms they received the goods. When I order stuff, I don't even put a discount amount, I just use 0% so sometimes you'll get a good deal for the coins I think.

Miners still welcome it, but unfortunately the majority of the hash power is centralized. So it FEELS like "miners" don't welcome it anymore. Trying to convince the current powerhouse is difficult, because they really prefer Bitcoin Unlimited as they have ties to the steering committee (and CEO) of that coin.
It only takes 5% to block transition (MASF) to SegWit. We can keep trying to show the upside to miners, but the real upside is having influence in Bitcoin Unlimited planning which is more powerful than fees alone.
I don't think there is any conspiracy here, just normal selfish motivations. I wouldn't expect any miner to behave or think any differently, which is why I'm always surprised that people are surprised. But I'm not really that surprised, because I've gotten somewhat used to people being surprised by selfish people.
OMG, billionaire Trump is acting selfish? Who would have thought??
OMG, government representatives are corrupt? Who would have thought??
OMG, rich people are trying to gain more power? Who would have thought??
OMG, a driver on the road thinks all other drivers are bad? Who would have thought??
OMG, cowardly people are being manipulated by power hungry people? Who would have thought??
OMG, a mouse wants milk after being given a cookie? Who would have thought??
It's all business-as-usual for me. It's more surprising when anyone acts in good faith and consideration for others, but that is rare, a blessing, and never should be what is expected as the norm. Bitcoin's cooperative beginnings were pretty cool, but never meant to stay that way forever. USAF is pretty cool, and if it works, it's almost a confirmation that there is still a bit of rebellion left in the first rebellion cryptocurrency.

It makes me wonder why companies are interested in Bitcoin at all.
It's an amazing technology, yes - but for doing what? It's amazing for giving freedom and power back to people. Is that a marketable thing? How do you build a company on that?
If a technology that enables freedom and decentralization is truly valuable in the eyes of a company, why did so few companies care to invest in ensuring that the web (as envisioned by Tim Berners Lee) remained decentralized? And now we're overrun by censorship, lack of privacy, and government control.
The reality is, they all jumped on the Internet because they saw business opportunity, not because they gave a shit about people's freedom or people's voices.
Bitcoin is OUR technology (you, me, and every individual who uses it because they are sick of government control, sick of waste, sick of corrupt banks, and sick of being financially powerless). It's a sword tempered in the flames of rebellion and activism. We can easily stand to lose it, overtaken by corporate minions.
Of course, it CAN be used for interesting things like smart contracts and payment as a protocol - but the reality is, all those thing could be implemented by a central body if it was adopted enough. For example, if Apple Pay became popular enough, it could easily DO those things in a centralized way where you have to trust Apple 100% (as you'd have to trust a Bank or the Government). It's not revolutionary primarily because of how fast you can pay, or what blockchain technology offers. It's revolutionary because for the first time NOBODY can STEAL your money (given your own diligence in protecting it).
A lot of companies and businesses completely misunderstand what Bitcoin really is and why it has value.
And sometimes, a bit of decentralized rebellion is exactly what we need to remind them.

And right now coins are hard to move due to fees, and it's creating a false shortage and bubble prices. Should come down once fees are normal again.

I think a useful security feature would be refusal to uninstall the app unless I can provide proof that I have a backup. Otherwise, it would require me to transfer the balance to somewhere else until it is 0 then allow me to uninstall it. But this probably goes against some Android App developer rules.

What is your idea?
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:31:17
"UASF/SegWit" is a proposal to change how Bitcoin works in order to reduce fees and speed up transactions. But, as with any change, there is fear. Once everyone is comfortable that there are no security holes in the idea, it will be accepted and Bitcoin software will be updated.
There isn't really anything you need to do, until announcements are made to update your software. If you use an online provider, exchange, etc. then they take care of the update. If you use a downloaded app, you may need to grab a newer version.
You really don't have to do much if you're a non-engineer, but listen to your *trusted* engineers if they suggest doing something to keep you safe during this time. Much like you would trust any professional: a mechanic for your car, a doctor for your health. Everyone should have a primary care engineer who can guide you in these times.

I thought I created a backup and then realized it wasn't for this wallet. It was a 12-word backup for my electrum wallet. I've had mycelium on my phone for over a year now, and never had problems upgrading it before. Except this time it forced me to uninstall it completely before installing the new version which I thought was really weird.
I think that there should be some kind of warning and/or automatic backup that happens with a last-minute secure password if the balance is not 0, if you try to uninstall it. I can't think of a situation where someone would want to uninstall and lose all their coins. This thing is not really newbie friendly at all.

Bitcoin can split at any time, and the only reason it hasn't, is because it destroys the value of the coin itself.
The only REAL reason to split is if a bug or other really critical issue is found that makes Bitcoin broken (and the value would go to $0). Then, the split is done to fix Bitcoin so we can continue on our happy way. Nobody cares for a $0 Bitcoin.
So don't worry about it.
If it does split for any crazy reason, you have coins on both chains. And the bitcoin associated to your account on Coinbase are not YOUR bitcoin. They are Coinbase's bitcoins which they graciously let you use. If you really want to OWN bitcoin, you have to transfer them to your own wallet where you and ONLY you have the private keys.
@_date: 2015-10-12 05:16:01
Fair enough. Still, wish there was a safer way to protect my coins than remembering if I had a backup or not. I don't have any idea especially when I created the wallet YEARS ago. I don't remember stuff for that long.

I thought the app data would stick around because it would be encrypted by a PIN or password.
So what happened was:
1. I loaded the app as usual, but instead of the normal account screen I got something that said a new version was available, and only one button at the bottom of the screen to upgrade.
2. When I clicked the upgrade button, it took me to the Google Play store. But on the play store, it said that I already had the latest version, so I clicked on "Open" (green button).
3. Clicking Open took me to Mycelium which again, told me to upgrade. I was very confused at this point. I couldn't seem to upgrade, and I couldn't use the app either because this upgrade screen blocked me from checking my account or transferring money.
4. I was really frustrated by this, and clicked UPGRADE yet again, which took me to the google store again, and it still said "Open" and no option to update. So I clicked "uninstall" in hopes that a re-install will get rid of the blocking upgrade screen.
5. I uninstalled the app manually hoping that  i had a backup (which i didnt it turns out) and that  the app would at least keep track of the app data separately from the app
6. I installed the new version of the app
7. The app installation was done, and I could get into the App finally without the upgrade screen.
8. It asked me for a backup file or seed, which I didn't have except the wrong seed. So that didn't work.
9. I click "create new wallet" and ended up with a 0 balance. And I lost all my coins.

Well, with Bitcoin you can change your mindset. You'll get extremely far just saving as much Bitcoin as you can. You can invest, but I would only do that after you have a sizable savings stashed away safely.
Anyways, you'll have to come up with your own financial plan, because your situation is unique. Good luck.

I like to compare this with a gigantic game of Jenga where millions of people have billions invested in ensuring the system works.
There is a robot playing Jenga automatically, and it removes a block and places it at the top of the stack every 10 minutes in regular fashion.
The problem is, the Jenga stack isn't growing fast enough to support everyone who wants to play.
So some people propose making the robot move faster (5 minute window) and some people propose making the robot take TWO blocks per time.
But the original instructions to tell the robot to work on one block every 10 minutes is such that we know is secure. If it moves faster or tries to do two blocks at a time, we change the rules such that some people have a slight advantage in the game. And it doesn't make the game any less treacherous.
And because people have so much invested in it, people are biting their fingernails as the stack grows and could collapse at any time. Which is even more reason to be even MORE CAREFUL and diligent (as the Core team has been) rather than MORE BRASH (as those pushing for changes sooner). This isn't a small game of Jenga anymore. Lives are now at stake. People have mortgaged their homes to join this Jenga stack. It's even more critical to be thoughtful about changes and really listen to protocol experts rather than rhetoric or opinion.
But all this stress of the giant high-stakes Jenga game will inevitably cause a lot of politics and noise. Just as much as the billion dollar oil industry or the billion dollar health care industry. Now politics join the billion dollar bitcoin industry, but we have the advantage of mathematical verification and simulation, decentralization, balance of power, and not requiring blind faith. It's financial science, and we should be weary of anyone claiming to know "what is best to change" for bitcoin without showing proof and evidence.
Or else this Jenga game is going to end really badly.

A lot of people try to clone Bitcoin (it's free software that anyone can download). These clones are called alternative coins, or alt-coins.
BCC and litecoin are both alt-coins.
You don't really need to worry about alt-coins if you own Bitcoin.
SegWit is a very specific piece of technology that you also shouldn't have to worry about if you're just a user. Just like you probably don't care of the engineering details of why a spark plug in your car is made. It's just a detail and there are thousands of pieces of really cool technology that makes Bitcoin work.
You don't really have to do anything. Just keep your private keys (or seed) safe, don't trust online exchanges or wallets, and make sure you have a backup plan.

Also, be careful with any wallet that is connected to the internet. It's so easy to get hacked these days.
Best is to create a cold-storage wallet. You should practice transferring money in and out of cold-storage using a small amount of Bitcoins.
If that is too hard, then a hardware wallet might be a good solution. I am a bit skeptical of those though, just because who's to say that the manufacturer didn't keep a copy of the private keys on that device or maliciously engineered the hardware.

I think motivations important. People are skeptical, and that should be addressed first. Who seeks to gain from it? Why do people want others to use it?
* Bitcoin is libertarian money.
* Bitcoin is a grassroots movement, born in reaction to the government's irresponsible fiscal policies.
* Bitcoin is a mathematically secure way of determining who owns value.
* Bitcoin is run by the very individuals who wish to use it. Their motivation is freedom and share libertarian goals.
* The number of Bitcoins issued cannot be artificially inflated by a central organization (such as the government).
* Unlike Visa, Paypal, and the Federal Reserve, there is no central organization that can dictate whether your claim to that value is valid or not.
* With Bitcoin, you have the freedom to exchange money with anyone in the world without a middleman - prying into your privacy or blocking your access for any reason.
* Bitcoin puts the power back into the hands of the people, and out of the hands of government and Federal Reserve.
* Bitcoin needs your help, because it's not a commercial product and doesn't have a marketing team like Apple does. It solely relies on spreading through word-of-mouth by freedom loving individuals.

For alt-coin discussions such as XT, ABC, BTC1, you should check out general cryptocurrency forums like Personally, it's just as ridiculous as all the others who claim that it's the "real" Bitcoin.
People should care more about the preservation of their own wealth than stealing the wealth of others. Don't mistake the facade of "good intentions" as genuine with these people like Garzik. Bitcoin, in fact, was built on the notion that in a world full of bad intentions, we can have a currency where trust isn't required. That's the whole point and the beauty of it all.
Think about it, if Garzik really wanted to just preserve his wealth and have all the attributes of the perfect coin, he should SELL all his Bitcoin and transfer them into "GarzikCoin" or "JihanCoin" or BTC1 or whatever the latest alt-coin he wants actually is. And once he's sold them, he has money in the  currency (in his mind) and he can stop harassing everyone.
Instead, why does he need to go to war against Bitcoin? Well, because his intention isn't for the success of Bitcoin, nor is it for the preservation of his wealth in Bitcoin. He can sell at any time. This means the only other reason is that he wants to gain more wealth, by gaining more control.
And to that, I say sorry - Bitcoin doesn't owe him such a future.

Imagine if I gave you a 100 billion dollars, but with the caveat that you were not allowed to spend any of it, or else it would become worthless.
Does that really cause a problem that you own so much of the wealth?
Here's another way of putting it.
Bitcoin is real money, in that nobody can artificially increase the number of them hence stealing your wealth. Imagine that the government only operated with Bitcoin because it was real money. Everything else was fraudulent in this hypothetical scenario.
Then, let's say someone invented a new currency called "dollars" and started scamming people with it. It seemed like real money, but a few corrupt individuals controlled it. The government would crack down on these scammers, because it steals from people's hard earned money. It takes advantage of people who are may not be bright enough to fall for the scam.
Would you feel safer holding real money, or scam dollars?

I think the best strategy for Bitcoin adoption is not to target the end nodes. That's often the hardest, because there are just too many people. Reaching individual savers with barely any money left to save and small shops who can't afford to lose time catering to 0.0001% of their customer base are the hardest to convert.
We should target the backbone of money first. The rest then follows.
B2B international trade. Business lending. Investing for the super wealthy. Once that happens, the rest is automatic. Because the dollar starts collapsing even faster than it already is, which automatically forces people to start considering options like Bitcoin. They don't need to be convinced anymore, it's a matter of survival rather than a matter of choice.
It's good to spread the knowledge and hit em on all fronts, but the big change is when big money enters bitcoin.

basic economics, like in an auction

It needs to scale to act as a currency. A currency is everyday money for people's daily lives. You could say Bitcoin is already an exclusive currency that is costly to obtain and transact with.
Bitcoin is meant to be peer to peer with no middleman charging exorbitant fees, but we're in a situation now where miners are the middlemen and by suppressing scaling solutions they are creating a fee market where they can earn more money than even traditional middlemen like Visa or Western Union.
So to solve this, we need to get more decentralization at the same time increase the capacity so that fees don't go up so high. A fee market is baked into the system, and the current mechanism of limiting exchange may be a very good one for the first layer of Bitcoin.
Now, we need to expand on this solid foundation and allow smaller cheaper transactions to happen on the side, to be settled following the original Bitcoin rules and potentially higher fees.
This means that the smaller side channel players who can aggregate tons of smaller transactions will be able to offer smaller fees than those who do not, in order to pay for the settlement on the root chain.
This doesn't stop anyone from connecting directly to the Bitcoin settlement network, but it may be cost prohibitive because of high fees.
If enough trust in sub decentralized chains are developed, however, there is no distinct advantage in directly settling on the root chain. Particularly if you know that your side channel will settle on the root chain in a predictable and verifiable manner.
Hopefully, miners can also earn on the fees to verify the side chains as well. Good, or popular side chains may eventually become a popular as the root chain today, which earns a lot of fees, but may trigger yet a third layer. 
Hopefully with n layers, we can scale Bitcoin to infinity, while keeping the verification security the same and never censoring or blocking small players from simply joining the root chain anytime.

I used to really be against the idea of things like Credit Card companies providing a layer on top of Bitcoin. Or things like Coinbase and Circle collecting private information to exchange. But I've changed my mind about these things.
If the mainstream really cared about privacy and lower fees, they would have demanded it already and the markets would have adjusted. If the mainstream really didn't like chargebacks, that would have also adjusted.
The reality is, the mainstream actually *prefers* giving away tons of privacy and freedom, in order to have security (or security in theory). There's a reason why political parties that put responsibility into the hands of citizens are unpopular. And political parties that say, "government will take care of you" are actually popular.
That being said, Bitcoin isn't doomed. If Bitcoin becomes the financial backbone of "insured financial layers" then that's still a huge win. And also Bitcoin is unstoppable in its current form anyways, which means it's automatically protection against the problems of "insured financial layers" for those who understand Bitcoin.
I don't think Bitcoin needs to be adopted by the mainstream anymore. I don't think we need Bitcoin being used to buy coffee and donuts and groceries. That isn't the point of Bitcoin or was ever the strength of Bitcoin.
There simply isn't a demand for a libertarian currency by the mainstream. That being said, the mainstream will happily use an insured layer on top of a Bitcoin backbone. So if credit cards are still used, great. Credit cards that use government currency to settle and store value will be suffering, versus credit cards that use Bitcoin. And thus, credit card companies may choose to deal in Bitcoin anyways. The end users, mainstream, would still get "fraud detection and protection" and all the other insurance noise, along with ridiculous late fees and interest charges. But that's exactly what they want.
And legitimate exchanges collecting data for KYC and AML are doing exactly what the mainstream wants as well. They want to feel safe. And the businesses should also feel safe.
Now, does the fringestream want privacy and ownership of their money and low fees? Yes, yes, and yes. And that's already all available now. Everything you want already exists.
What benefit is there to having Bitcoin move to the mainstream? I think at a consumer level, very little. And it's so complex, and the motivations are so different, that it simply won't happen - and shouldn't happen. If you take something highly technical and highly libertarian, and shove it in the face of someone who can barely use their iphone and want more social security - they will just reject it immediately. It's pointless.
The people really pushing for Bitcoin to go mainstream are usually ones who want their "Bitcoin investment" to "go to the moon". That's fair enough, but it won't happen. Instead, what these people should be pushing for is large swaths of adoption as a financial backbone to other services. Yes, even as Western Union. So we SHOULD have Western Union use Bitcoin underneath their layers. And dumb people, sorry, mainstream people, will use Western Union because they have a nice legitimate store front they can walk into and feel good about themselves. And that's OKAY. Western Union profits from the speed and expediency of Bitcoin underneath their layers. And there is a growth in adoption of Bitcoin, invisible to the mainstream. 
The combined usage of Bitcoin as a backbone will inevitably raise the value of Bitcoin, with less trouble than trying to get Joe  Schmoe and Jane Starbucks to start paying for daily items with Bitcoin -- an activity which works PERFECTLY FINE for them using Credit Cards. Bitcoin poses no advantage for them, and I'm finally OKAY with that.

The first question people seem to ask is "why does this have any value?" where as dollars (as fake as they may be) are accepted for goods and services all over the place and gold/jewelry has some tangible value. Bitcoin, being something a bunch of nerds invented, and put some tiny amounts of money into which is now worth millions -- how does it help me more than it helps the early adopters (as valid as their "risk-taking" may be)?
And if they are not already part of the "inflation is bad" and economically conservative crowd, they are no clear and immediate benefit for this tool.
But, if you set this up somewhere there's rampant inflation (like Venezuela) you will certainly get more traction.
It's still useful to promote and spread the knowledge - but the expectations should be set appropriately. Bitcoin is not useful for the mainstream (until they are educated about sound money). Venmo, Paypal, Visa, Mastercard, these things are working fine. Gold bugs are tough to convert, because they've seen too many gimmicks come and go and generally proven right by sticking to gold.

Because we don't have time machines. They can't see the price now and say, "oh shit the price is high. let me go back a few months ago and get it for less."
There are people mining Bitcoin who are willing to sell it to cover their costs plus some profit. That sets up kind of a baseline price. And then there's added demand on top of that, which is how desperate people want to get rid of their government inflated dollars or desperate to buy some recreational substances on a dark net because they're addicted to it.
So the price goes up.
Unless people want to just get rid of it. Then it goes down.
People can try to hold and push the price up, and to some degree, that's the power that a "whale" has (someone with a lot of money). Market manipulation is possible.
But the thing is, people are not linked by any kind of union contract that forces them to do anything. So as the price changes, they will take action based on if they think they're getting a good deal before everyone else. Whether it's going up or down.
It all balances out automatically.

It's a "scam" in the sense that the creator forked Bitcoin, mined a bunch of it, and now pushes it constantly as "silver to Bitcoin's gold" when it's really just another copy. Some people claimed it had value for some differences in it's mining approach or whatever, but in the end it's pretty clear that it doesn't offer much more than Bitcoin, copied Bitcoin, and just hopes of making the creator really really rich. Could it be the same for Satoshi? Maybe, but at least Bitcoin didn't exist already and Satoshi didn't just copy 99% of it.
Or maybe it's not a scam, you can decide.

The physical universe doesn't actually run on opinions. It runs on principles and unbreakable mathematical laws.
If someone has a negative opinion on Bitcoin who has not spent the time to understand the concepts, technology, and mathematics behind Bitcoin, then their opinion is not worth anything.
If someone's understanding of economics is absolute, in a world where some of the most accredited economists consistently get it wrong, they are stubbornly ignorant. Nobody should claim to know the entire truth of economics, but I do know at least personally, that I don't like the idea that the money I earned is worth less and less over time. I'm certainly not an economic expert, and I'm keeping an open mind, but I have yet to hear a convincing argument that I should let my hard work go to waste.
There are ignorant people, stupid people, and simpletons all around us. First, if you are not humble enough to believe that you might be wrong, and not curious enough to try to learn more to seek the truth, you will remain in that group. Second, I have a lot of respect for those who are not yet educated, but are trying to learn. The arrogance of some arm-chair economists just blow my mind. And third, I don't necessarily have great malice towards the ignorant. They follow the herd. They like what is popular. They are actually easily manipulated - less by facts, and more by emotional reaction. This can be to our benefit sometimes!
I suspect that once Bitcoin is mainstream, all these naysayers will jump right on board and not think twice. Just like the Internet was once a "secret cyberspace lair for nefarious hackers" less than 20 years ago, Bitcoin will eventually be accepted more for the potential good it can do for the world. People just naturally fear what they don't understand. Once they are educated about it, and understand how to deal with it properly, it's not so bad.

And it all really starts to make sense how we ended up with such a broken government and broken financial system. People are so easily fooled. And they want the government to protect them from their own foolishness. Which they happily provide by taxing them. And on top of that, some of these foolish people who are giving their money to government get excited when they are refunded some of it. It was their to begin with!!

They are just more of the same authoritarianism that brought you wonderful things such as the IRS, the Federal Reserve, etc. so if you really like your wealth being stolen then maybe it's a good choice. 
There have been many attempts to take power away from Bitcoin such as BTC1, BCC, XT, Classic, BU, etc. but the reality is that people, if they realize the danger in re-centralization and authoritarianism, then it's a clear loser in the picture.

There will be continued attacks and attempts to take away the single most powerful attribute of Bitcoin - that it decentralization. The only thing needed to protect that attribute is knowledge that you are not a slave, and freedom begins with the belief that individual sovereignty trumps nationalistic pride.
If BCC exists and used by billions of Chinese who don't understand the value of trustless decentralized global currency, then that's just a mental gap that will eventually be bridged when the inevitable corruption of BCC dictators steal their wealth.
The only thing stopping Bitcoin's growth is the understanding that you can actually be free, that you can actually control your money, and that you can take power away from the most formidable worldwide entities in a surprisingly peaceful way. If people understood this, Bitcoin would be far bigger than it is now. But people are not all interested in politics and for the most part completely absorbed in the day to day minutia of their lives.
Whether or not BCC, BU, BTC1, ABC, XT, etc. exists is not worrisome. It is simply more status quo, more authoritarian regime, more of what everything Bitcoin is not.

I'm not sure what all the hoopla is about.
Satoshi left us with a whitepaper and a reference implementation. And he made it clear that it will be left in the hands of others to build upon it.
The reference implementation changes all the time. Why _wouldn't_ the whitepaper also get updates? That being said, such updates should come with careful review. If a disagreeable change is made, either by subversion or malice or ignorance, it should be voiced with logical and clear explanations. Ultimately users will again decide whether the original whitepaper is better or not by choosing to use the one better suited for their needs. I'm not a core developer (although I am a software developer) but I review things and if I start seeing changes being made that are against the principles which attracted me to Bitcoin, I would move my coins to something else. And that's the risk they take when changing either the whitepaper or the reference implementation. So far, I haven't seen a lot of convincing arguments that any specific change should cause me to think about moving. But I am keeping watch.
We can't control or prevent technological advancement anymore than we can prevent people from building upon an opensource whitepaper or some opensource C++ source code. And that's kind of the point, and perhaps even the hope. That everything will continue to evolve and improve over time.
There will always be the original, unaltered PDF, just as you can download the original, unaltered reference client. It will never completely disappear off the internet. I don't think anyone could get rid of that, even if they tried.

But those fees are sort of like a built-in insurance. Most credit cards will protect you from fraud, etc. It's a fee with a purpose. In that sense, Bitcoin is inferior, because it doesn't protect you from that sort of thing.
And in terms of the wait, Bitcoin is exceedingly slow because a "confirmation" can take 10 minutes sometimes longer. Most people don't understand that this is "settlement" which isn't the same as what happens when a credit card payment is "accepted". And Bitcoin wallets don't usually make this clear at all, so a bunch of people end up thinking Bitcoin is ridiculously slow.
It's still a tough sell to the mainstream. I think the better sell is just show them a chart of how much value the dollar has lost to inflation in the last 10, 20, and 50 years.

Hoarding is fine. But you can also hoard and not hoard at the same time.
You buy the exact amount you wish to hoard. Then, you buy a little extra on top of that which you're willing to sell to other people (aka buy stuff for yourself or exchange other people's dollars) at the market price, in order to help people get on board with Bitcoin.
So you get the best of both worlds.
If everyone just held their Bitcoins and none of it was moving even to people who were curious about it, we end up with low liquidity and a loss of tangible use to people who want to try it.
There will come a day when hoarding Bitcoin all the time is great, but right now, you can actually do both.
Personally, I think a 95%-to-5% works for me. So I hoard, but I reserve a certain percentage of liquidity just to help my friends get into Bitcoin too. It's an amount which doesn't affect my hoarding and I don't cut into my hoarding percentage if I run out of liquidity.
That being said, I don't shove it onto people. It's a voluntary currency, and I help people who show genuine interest. Everyone else, I might mention it, but I won't beg them to take my precious.

Be sure that you test coin recovery. Try putting $0.05 in BTC in the wallet, then deleting the wallet completely. Then see if you can get it back with only the paper backup.
Then, be sure your paper backup is safe. Remember, ink fades, some paper lasts a lot longer than others.
And a lot of people forget where they put the paper backup.

This is also confusing me in terms of solving anonymity with a mixing service.
If nobody can prove that some address I sent bitcoins to is really me or a random guy at an internet cafe, who needs a mixing service? It seems pretty anonymous already, as long as it's difficult to connect a wallet to a person. And the best way of doing that, as far as I can tell, is to know that the transaction initiated from an IP under the control of a particular person.
Or perhaps part of the money in a given wallet address was spent on an "identity revealing" destination (say to legally purchase an item that collects identity info) and another part (but same source address) to buy something illegal. In this case, it's highly probable, aside from the wallet being stolen, that the same identity buying the legal goods also bought the illegal goods. I could understand that scenario.
Is there another scenario I'm missing here?

One of the big advantages of Bitcoin is the privacy in which you can conduct your business. This includes both the government and your own parents. There is no proof that you ever made the exchange, no proof that you even own the coins you bought. 
That being said, if you feel you have a moral obligation to let your parents know these things, that's a good thing. If they are reasonable parents, and interested in learning about the nuances between foreign exchange vs digital currency, then there is hope that you can talk to them and find a way to keep your coins.
If they are unreasonable, don't care to listen to you because you are young, then I would just do what you think is right. Stashing some Bitcoin away as a young person is really genius in my opinion, because old people are ruining money. You are protecting yourself, and I really am in support of that.

Why would there be a bank run?
People know that USD in banks are not 1:1 in real USD, yet there arn't any major bank runs that I know about. The average person doesn't care. 
Once there are enough BTC institutions working together, than can decide to "credit a mortgage payment" out of the "paycheck account" all by shifting numbers around without ever transacting a single real BTC. And once they start doing this on a massive scale, and for paychecks that arn't there yet, and mortgage balances that are higher than people can afford, then you start to build the magical pyramid that collapsed in 2008 except in BTC this time. BTC is a solution for people who want a system that works properly. But if people don't understand or don't care, then BTC certainly doesn't stop anything.
It's up to us to decide when a big BTC institution starts issuing "BTC Notes" or "BTC Credits" which can be redeemed for real BTC, to reject the "BTC Notes" and ask for REAL BTC.
It will come. Be prepared.

I think the most confusing thing is that with all these incredible ASICs and huge mining rigs that are skyrocketing the difficulty, I have no idea what a bitcoin is worth.
Sure, it's worth 130 fiat dollars right now, but that's something I just come to "accept" and as I want to use bitcoins, I'll trade some dollars for bitcoins at the current price. It wouldn't be any different it was 1000 dollars for 1 BTC or 1000 BTC for 1 dollar. It's just the "current" exchange rate.
But if we lived in a world without USD, and we were mostly just bartering, how many bitcoins is a basket of eggs worth? How many bitcoins is a chunk of real estate worth? I'm not sure how to measure that. You could say, "its worth whatever people are willing to trade" but that makes no sense. How do I negotiate my 1000 bitcoins for eggs? If I say it's worth 1 satoshi per egg, that's pretty arbitrary. And if the receiver has no way to differentiate between 1 satoshi and 1 BTC other than "it's a bunch of decimal points", the whole thing is extremely arbitrary.

I think we need a better marketplace (auction or not) for items bought and sold with BTC.
I also think a premium-service like PayPal that protects consumers with chargebacks (basically insured purchasing) would be good. There are some people who would be willing to pay a 5-10% premium to know that if the merchant skips town, they can get some (if not all) their money back.
Another cool idea is if there was a peer-to-peer assistance service where people can get help or provide help for some amount of BTC on various things they need help with. For example, setting up a new Bitcoin wallet (as they might have lots of questions), or maybe even tasks like taskrabbit. But that would sort of need mass adoption before it gets really useful probably.

I expect isolated government-sponsored PSA ads that associate bitcoins with aiding terrorism and child pornography. They did the same sort of thing with marijuana use. If you smoke, you're helping a terrorist. While this might not affect private users, the negative association might stop a business. And people will start fighting amongst themselves to report anyone seen using virtual currencies to the authorities. Such people would then have their computers confiscated and held up as an example to others for supporting terrorism. The fear alone will stifle the growth and acceptance of the currency.

Wait... but the price hasn't changed on any exchanges... How does the amount and number of transactions directly relate to the price in that case?

When silk road shut down, I would logically assume a TON of transactions stopped happening. And yes, the price went down. But I don't think it went down to the degree that transactions stopped happening. And within days, the price was recovered. And I don't think it went back up because suddenly people were transacting again on some new silk road replacement that quickly.
So what I'm saying is, it did not matter how much people transacted on silk road or if silk road stopped. The price moved primarily on speculation and fear. If the price was truly based off of the number of transactions per day/hour, then I would have expected a much bigger drop-off. It does not make sense to that a lot of transactions would change the value of a bitcoin.
Sometimes gold bars move a lot. Sometimes they don't move so much. But as long as people VALUE them in the same way, who cares how much they move? Who cares how many are shipped in a container from one place to another? If people agree on the price, then that's the price. I don't think it matters how many transactions they do or the amount they decide to use. And increasing the transactions or increasing the price of the good/service wouldn't fundamentally change the value of a bitcoin (or nugget of gold). Any change would be speculative.
But anyways, I cannot convince you otherwise. So whatever.

I think about how bitcoin is so new and thus, potentially risky. Then I think about how I've already [lost maybe 50%+ of my purchasing power]( in USD in the last 10 years, and think that there's a lot of risk in keeping USD as well. And based on current US economic policy, I only see it getting worse. I include bitcoin as one part of a diversified safe-haven portfolio. I try to keep only 3-6 months of living expenses in USD because I find it riskier than many investments; everything else in stuff I hope doesn't lose over half of it's value in decade.

Add to this, a predisposition either socially or genetically an expectation that the concerns of wealth and the concerns of being a provider of hearth and home is that of the realm of the man also adds to the male-domination of Bitcoin. 
This is a big hurdle to climb. We would be fighting a very fundamental battle here to change the viewpoint. It makes me sad that young girls even in 2013 are still obsessed with fashion and makeup (not all, duh) and sometimes I feel like no progress has been made since 1950. But there is progress, and there are women getting into Bitcoin. Just as in technology in general. 
The right thing to do would be to let Bitcoin's own merits be it's own merits. And not try to manipulate the message in order to attract some group who isn't interested right now.
But sometimes, the right thing to do would take decades, maybe even several generations to actually change. 
And so, for practical purposes, I'm supporting easyrandomguy's message - while at the same time, encouraging a social change in the world such to reduce sexist expectations in people in general. Sounds like a conflict, but I don't think it is. There's room for being both idealistic and realistic at the same time.

Bitcoin and Paypal are fundamentally different.
Just as your physical cash wallet and a body guard are two different things. Your wallet is not "flawed" because it doesn't have a built-in body guard to protect you from thugs who mug you at gun point. 
Any system that protects consumers is good, even Paypal's portion of that. But Paypal as general payment processing is filled with problems, such as high fees, problematic rules, and regulatory enforcement. Any Bitcoin-based system to protect consumers can have the exact same problems, too. 
Because it's not Bitcoin with the problem. Bitcoin serves its purpose very well.

Terminology and point of reference seems to be hard to change. For example, I've been trying to correct everyone who calls Bitcoin a "virtual currency" by explaining that it's no more virtual than fiat dollars. And in fact, it's probably more real in the sense that it can only be created through a difficult mining process. I've been trying to get people to call it a "digital currency" or a "cryptocurrency" but it's really stuck like glue.
Using 1 BTC rather than 1000 mBTC is probably a similar problem.
Perhaps if we start getting software developers to automatically have their code use mBTC for values of bitcoin when 1 BTC is greater than or equal to $1000 US on an exchange or averages API. As this becomes a "customary practice" we'll start to see people refer to the right amounts.
So what I mean by this is, for example, if people are using blockchain.info's wallet and the exchange rate goes above $1000 it becomes mBTC automatically. And so does Bitcoin-QT's default payment amount. And so does Electrum. And so does all the popular charting sites. In other words, the entire world automatically shifts to mBTC pricing.
And, this code should be automatically prepared for the next smaller units as well, sort of like a clock. We don't want our clock to be broken like a Y2K bug. So if the price then goes to $1,000,000 per BTC, we adjust to uBTC pricing across the board.
Every 1000X, we adjust the naming automatically - IN SOFTWARE - and I think people will get accustomed to dealing with the different names.
It will be a consistent treatment of when to use BTC, mBTC, and uBTC.
Just like we don't say that pool is 5000 centimeters long, we just call it 50 meters naturally.
If we're talking about units of BTC smaller than 0.0001, we should naturally describe it in mBTC because it fits right.
We don't need to say "let's all use mBTC at the same time". When buying candy, we price it in mBTC, and when buying houses we price it in BTC. I think that's OK.
And having the software switch (as is most natural and appropriate) would help all of us with getting used to the different usages.

We don't need "them" to understand bitcoin. Those people who sheepishly follow whatever they are told by people that they trust, without understanding why, are the same people who will just switch to bitcoin without understanding it.
They will think, "Oh I guess it's pretty easy, setup a wallet, pay for stuff. It's like an online credit card, sort of." And that's pretty much it for transitioning them.
Let the 70% follow the rest of us. The real challenge will be converting the people with large trust followings. Respected leaders. Well-known authors and publications. Popular talk-show hosts and celebrities. These are the people who the dimwits will follow, and these are the people who, if converted to bitcoin, will convert the rest of the masses by pure trust and influence alone.
I'm sure there's a large pool of people who bought into bitcoin just because: "Hey those Winklevoss twins seem smart. They went to Harvard. They were even involved in Facebook early. They are famous. They probably know what they are doing, so I'm going to trust this Bitcoin thing, even though I don't know crap about it."

I think you have to assume that net-arb.com is 100% useless.
Lend at a rate higher than the defaulting rate.
Let's say 80% of people never pay back their loans. Then, if loan amounts are spread evenly, you should be charging 85% interest.
Of course, there are some people with some "reputation" which changes the equation.
So if the default rate is 30% of A+ rating users with 5+ loans totaling 50 BTC or more, then you should be looking for A+ investments that are maybe at 35-40% interest rate. This lets those who successfully pay you back make up for the losses in the other investments.
Right now, though, the site makes absolutely no sense where people with horrible or non-existent reputation are expecting big loans at extremely low rates (lower than even credit card or payday loans). This makes no sense, you put a ridiculous amount of risk on yourself, and you will lose all your money (duh).
If you are going to use BTCJam, you have to know what you are doing. You cannot rely on net-arb.com or strong-arming the cash out of a guy who blew the money and is 100% broke. The money is gone.

No surprise. Government hates anything it cannot control. Bitcoin was designed with this in mind, so it is decentralized without a single point of failure. It may attack businesses the same way they attacked ISPs and hosting providers. Some businesses will comply, while others go rogue. In the end, they will be destroying the ability for the business to make money and compete. The ones that don't need to hire an army of lawyers and register for all kinds of special licenses will be at an advantage. And conforming businesses will slowly die.
As that happens, I see two possibilities.
1) They realize they are choking the economy, putting legitimate business at a HUGE disadvantage over others particularly overseas. They relax the laws.
2) They don't relax the laws. And the landscape for business fundamentally changes such that an underground or black market appears for things as common as shampoo and bananas. Would you rather pay (equivalent of) $1.00 for a bottle of shampoo on the underground (Free) bitcoin market, or pay $25.00 for a bottle of shampoo on the heavily marked up non-free US-government regulated market?
Even if the markup isn't so dramatically different, competition will eventually drive the other business out. There are cases where a 2-cent price different at Walmart is enough for consumers to go there, rather than the Mom&amp;Pop store. 
Longer-term, it only hurts the country that is being governed, and either the country and it's government wakes up to the situation and returns freedom to the people, or they end up destroying it themselves with regulation.

Do I need to pay taxes on USD when the exchange rate goes up, and taxes on BTC when the exchange rate goes down?
Let's say I buy $300 USD using 1 BTC. Then, the value of USD goes up and $300 USD costs 5 BTC.  If I then sell my $300 USD for 5 BTC, I have a net gain of 4 BTC. The fair market value of 4 BTC is $60 X 4 which is $240. Is that $240 subject to capital gains?
Now let's say the opposite happens. I buy 1 BTC using $300 USD. Then, the value of USD goes down and now 1 BTC is worth $900. I then sell my 1 BTC for $900. So in total, I have a net gain of $600 USD. Is that $600 subject to capital gains?
It sounds like I have to pay taxes on both directions. Whether I earn money on the BTC side when the value of BTC goes up, or when I earn money on the USD side when the value of USD goes up.
I'm getting burned in both directions! Two-sided taxation :(

Bitcoin becomes large enough to be looked upon as a threat to the US economic model, and thus laws are invented to track it's movement over the internet. Encryption that does not include a tap key (which allows US government officials to decrypt the connection) are outlawed. If any such encryption is detected, the issuing ISPs are immediately notified and the user's home is raided. Some politically minded people try to fight it, but the government is simply too big and citizens are simply too afraid to really do anything.
A few people who still believe in a free currency decide to invent a new crypto-currency (Bitcoin 2.0) and operate it over underground darknets (which were also banned by the US government), and most of the time they get away with it for a while, but eventually they close up after FBI surveillance discovers and raids them.
Time and again, overbearing governments crush freedom, crush privacy, and crush everything that makes a person a human being and not a cog designed for the sole purpose of satisfying government needs.
This goes on for several centuries, until the weight needed to support the corrupt can no longer be carried on the backs of the weak, the poor, and the enslaved. People can no longer fight against a technologically superior government military, and with a ban on weapons any revolution becomes outright impossible. 
However, pushed to the brink, some extremists decide that they want to free the world, they underestimate the destructive force they acquire, and a global Armageddon destroys all life on Earth leaving it a ball of dust without any atmosphere.

I'm not sure why so many people want existing companies to start accepting bitcoin, only to help them get richer and richer?
Why not just start a competitor to them and blow them out of the water by accepting bitcoin rather than convincing them of something that they are deaf to? 
If a merchant is too obtuse and can't help themselves by seeing the advantage in cutting credit card fees and adding another (small but growing) customer base, then they don't deserve to be a popular merchant.
I understand if you love their service and want to help them, but they're in it for profit and there's no reason to start a community rally to help them make more money. Well, unless you own stock in them or something.
Many merchants (and it seems the bigger they are, the less they will listen) seem to not want to hear it. And sometimes the pressure of a competitor who accepts bitcoin starting to take hold can sometimes scare the big merchant to take action. Bitcoin is small right now, it's tiny. Big companies don't have much incentive in listening, and you can ask, but I wouldn't beg.

There were some studies done about fundamental differences between male and female behavior in terms of taking risks. Compound that with differences in terms of attraction to "toy/gadget" interest, and you end up with a male-dominated world of bitcoin.
I don't know if this is nature or nurture, but if you believe that the "toy" factor and the "risk" factor make it seem less attractive to women, and you'd like there to be more female interest in bitcoin (why?) then you should address those things - and identify aspects of bitcoin that appeal to women specifically. Taking big risks and playing with toys are not appealing to women in the general sense. Bitcoin is a tool, a utility, a gadget, a toy. It is a risky one. It is powerful. These are aspects which excite men (the kind who love to play with toys and have a garage full of tools).
So what are things that would instead appeal to women?
* How it relates to social status among their peers. Pressure of social acceptance and socially acceptable behavior/appearance is very high on the list of important things.
* How it can be used to protect and preserve wealth. Rather than thinking of Bitcoin as risky, shift the mentality such that Bitcoin is seen as actually safer than alternatives.
* How it affects their social network (friends, family, community).
Disclaimer: 
And while it's pretty easy for this discussion to lead to "all women are not like this or that" - I'm pretty tired of people who are trying to fight "generalizations" which can be useful in analyzing real-world situations. The real world is not pure or an idealistic dreamland. Nothing I'm saying here applies to every woman.
Just like I'm a guy and I'm not into garages and tools and beer and sports - I still DO ACKNOWLEDGE that there is a TON OF MEN WHO ARE and therefore, it's worth looking at that demographically consistent group and there is a practical point to such generalizations. It does not offend me, as long as I am not forced into any sort of expectation of behavior or become excluded/discriminated by not meeting such generalizations.

That's why people use dollars and government wants you to  use dollars. They don't want you to slice a piece of the turtle. If you used dollars, the other person would HAVE to get fewer cards or a poorer set of cards from someone else, and you would have to get a smaller turtle or a less desirable turtle. That difference is the taxes you then pay in dollars.
If that is too complex at the time of transaction, you can wait until taxes are due. At which time, you have to sell your turtle for some dollars, send the tax due to the government, and then buy a different and less valuable turtle instead. You cannot have your original turtle, because you would be evading taxes aka stealing from the government.
It's pretty complex without dollars, but it really all just means whatever it is you bought or sold doesn't fully belong to you or the other person. You have to get less than what you traded, and send that difference equal to taxes out to government.

Sexism and statistics are two different things. Most people are completely and utterly sexist anyways. A man wearing makeup and carrying a purse even in today's society is still considered to be "weird" by the majority of people - even if you might think that in principle it shouldn't be. Sexism is alive and well, and will continue to be. Look at marketing - commercials - and sex(gender) targeted businesses. We're knee deep in it, not because of some EVIL SEXIST PLAN but rather, companies know that targeted marketing WORKS and the reality of the world isn't as pure and fair and non-discriminatory as idealists would like to have it. 
So I don't think it's fair to immediately cry "sexist" and destroy a useful conversation every time someone associates purses, prada, and jewelry to women when the bottom line of today's reality is exactly that. For better or for worse.
It's fine if we want to have some purist philosophical debate about how things "should be" and try to change the views of people and I'll be first on board with that. I'm sick of gender inequalities myself.
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't LOOK AT REALITY and see what is going on, even if it is sexist by any purist means. There are two different discussions, and both are meaningful, and we don't need to hijack one with the other constantly, making it impossible to have an honest discussion.

These types of stories make me wonder why it's so acceptable to provide so much KYA/AML information to exchanges such as MtGox, Bitstamp, etc. where you trade extremely private and personal information for access to a currency designed to free you from such totalitarian monitoring.
I know these automated online exchanges are far more convenient than localbitcoins or other more anonymous mechanisms, but is the convenience truly worth it? I think people are being led down the wrong path here. Too many people see investing in bitcoin as just another stock, ready to hand over all their private information. Their greed is making them blind. It's going to burn them, when the IRS collects all this information from Coinbase, Bitstamp and MtGox. They are going to have to answer a lot of tough, complex questions from the IRS or else face audits and/or fines.
I think we need to build more infrastructure to make the exchange of bitcoins more free, without sacrificing privacy. I think in 2014, the big push needs to be for bitcoin ATMs. It will make exchange simple and secure while maintaining the level of privacy we should demand and expect. I suspect a big push from government to regulate these ATMs, and there needs to be a plan to fight back.
Let's stop ruining such a pure and beautiful currency like Bitcoin with the plague of government surveillance.

Bitcoin is online money. It was created around 2008 and is slowly gaining acceptance for business around the world.
It is peer-to-peer, which means that no central bank or company controls the system. This gives bitcoin several strengths, such as lower or even zero transaction fees, instantaneous international transactions, and increased privacy.
There are a growing number of retailers (both online and offline) accepting bitcoins as a method of payment. 
Bitcoins are stored in a software program, or "digital wallet". They are spent by sending bitcoins to a receiver's bitcoin address in the form of (16KaCJB7fVuT6hvA7wzgzVjAnHz28bNvvh).
Bitcoins are obtained primarily by either selling goods/services for bitcoin or exchanging some currency (such as US dollar) into bitcoin.
Bitcoins are also initially created, or "mined", using software. The design of bitcoin is such that it becomes increasingly difficult to find new bitcoins as more people try to find them. This controls the total supply of bitcoins.
A bitcoin unit (often abbreviated BTC) is infinitely divisible. This means that even if the value of 1 BTC becomes very large, people can use smaller units such as mBTC or uBTC without any problem. This means that "running out" of bitcoins is not an issue.
Also, technical understanding of digital security is a requirement for using bitcoin, because digital wallets have been stolen in the past. Poorly secured wallets are very vulnerable in the system.
While there are growing talks of government regulation of digital money, there is still much debate surrounding it's use. It's use for illicit purposes, for example, is no different from paper cash today. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:23:19
It was just an example. If there's currently 12 million, then a transaction of $100 billion would push the price from $1 per BTC up to $83 which is FAR, FAR, FAR less than the current price of ~$900. And I don't think you can convince me that we're already doing $10 TRILLION in transactions today. Then $900 is justified.

There's no reason for it go to up or down. If a million people buy 0.01 BTC for $1 and a million people sell 0.01 BTC for $1 on any given day, what price would it be at the end of the day, mathematically? It would be $1 per 0.01 BTC. The supply doesn't change it, it just makes it a little more annoying by requiring more decimal points to fit the correct amount of BTC.
And there is a small effect due to the limited number of BTC, but I don't see it affecting the price to the degrees we see it when Bitcoin gets into the news.

That makes me wonder, how much would 1 bitcoin be worth if every person on Earth used it and it became the defacto currency? I don't think there would be enough bitcoins for any one person to own many of them. The price of a car might be 0.0000003 bitcoin. Of course, it's far fetched from actually happening, but the mathematics are entertaining to think about.

There was a time when "getting online" was for complete geeks with specialized electronics knowledge. Understanding you have some "gigabytes of memory" on a "computer" and you can use a "web" to "download or stream videos" was techno-gibberish that the layman would consider complete nonsense. Or the concept of even having it all in the palm of your hand on a smartphone. Now, the average teen probably understands all of that - if not the background of it, at least how to use it. I don't know how my car works, but I can drive it.
You are right in saying it will take time. But the time will come. What is jargon today is common sense tomorrow. The world is evolving faster than ever, and as it was with every generation before us, the children of the generation rapidly adopted to the new technologies faster and better than their parents. Kids are growing up with the internet as a de-facto part of life, not as a new addition. Same with cryptocurrencies. Someday, a kid will trade with some bubble gum with another kid for bitcoins and ask, "hey are you sure your PRN generator is solid? you don't want to be setting up with bad private keys."

I'm no expert. Perhaps someone can correct me on this pop-econ theory I have.
Stability can only be measured in relative terms. Bitcoin is infinitely stable compared to itself. But compared to larger currency markets such as USD, the mere fact that all of bitcoin isn't even 0.01% of all US dollars in the world means that even slight ripples look like tidal waves in the bitcoin world. Which means that, bitcoin prices can stabilize, but only when the reverse becomes significantly true. That is, most wealth and trade happens in bitcoin, and only a few esoteric transactions happen in USD. When will this happen? Nobody can know for sure. But, it is absolutely clear in my mind that the endless government borrowing will eventually destroy the currency. Even a magnificent military cannot operate with no money to spend.
Deflation may trigger some hoarding, but unless that hoarded money is spent, it can't be used for destructive purposes (such as bribery, lobbying, war mongering, etc.) as much as it can't be used for new opportunities (such as business investment). Hoarding would serve very little purpose to those who die without spending any of it. In other words, while deflation will certainly happen, human nature will keep trade working.
In the face of existing volatility, it seems clearly an issue for merchants. However, technology can step in and help. With near-instantaneous conversion from BTC to USD (or any other currency), merchants can choose to stay on whatever is more stable at the time. Conversion costs may continue to be a problem, but markets tend to look at problems as opportunities, and find ways to cut costs rapidly through competition.
I can't say for sure about BitPay's 1% fee, but I find it highly likely that fees will remain small and possibly even decrease in the face of high competition, low government regulation/restriction, and low barrier to entry. I wouldn't be surprised if fees were lowered even below 1% as more and more similar services compete for merchants. Hardware and software costs are drastically being cut every single year. Technology growth is impressive. What we do now on a $20 phone used to cost $100,000 as a super computer.
Anyways, these are just my non-professional ramblings. I don't expect any of this to hold up against any PhD economist's scrutiny.

I also struggle with the same thing. I told my friends about it 2 years ago and they were like, "that is such a scam". And when the price rose and it got in the news, they were like, "dude tell me how to buy some, I want to make money". So short-sided.
And I believe this has large implications for Bitcoin as a whole. There are many people who don't understand or don't care how corrupt things are, how bad things are politically, or how people around the world are suffering from it. We need them to adopt Bitcoin for the sake of accomplishing the kind of global financial revolution that drew people to Bitcoin back when it was worthless and never in the news. Otherwise, Bitcoin will be permanently limited to the world of hackers and geeks and techno-libertarians.
I thought about this, and it was pretty depressing. What a way to ruin hope for mankind.
But the more I thought about it, Bitcoin may naturally STILL produce the result we want, even without convincing the hard-to-convince masses about it's ideals.
Two reasons:
* We don't need enormous adoption for it to become globally accepted. There were posts about it before, but 10% adoption is all we need for it to catch on, because the people who don't care about Bitcoin probably don't care about the US dollar either, and they will follow whatever seems to be working better (in the long-term) regardless of political ideals. 
* The natural effect of "people using Bitcoin" being better off than "people not using Bitcoin" will draw people to it, regardless of if they are convinced of Bitcoin's political ideals. That is, they see people using Bitcoin making more money, transacting faster, not being hassled by banks, not losing money to inflation, getting richer, moving money to far away destinations cheaper, and generally living a BETTER FINANCIAL LIFE than those who do not. This cannot be ignored by the skeptics forever. 
In the end, I believe Bitcoin will succeed even without working insanely hard to convince the hardest skeptics. Because it's still incredibly usable, and it's still incredibly secure, and there are still at least 10% who are (or will be) interested in the political motivations of Bitcoin who will continue to fundamentally support Bitcoin enough to grow it, while the "speculators" and "skeptics" run around with their heads in the cloud, a bit clueless.
Everyone will never acknowledge it, but I do: you are one of many invisible heroes in this techno-revolution.

Why does it defeat it? I might have bitcoin savings (to protect against inflation). Now, I want to spend it at a merchant who ONLY accepts Visa. Then, having a middle-man who gives me a Visa card, and lets me buy things, and the middle-man pays the merchant, and then withdraws X bitcoin from my account, would be quite useful. I do this when I eat at restaurants with a buddy of mine who has a Visa card and he pays the bill with his card, and I pay him my share in BTC. But it would be cool if I could do this directly with a company who provides this service. The company would keep a debit balance, and be responsible for paying for the charges in USD against the BTC balance I hold with them (just like any bank).
I think Checks would work in the same way. It's really about convenience of not having to buy Visa gift cards myself using BTC or exchanging dollars for BTC. I don't think it defeats ALL the points of bitcoin, just maybe the transactional part. I still think it's a great place to store my nest egg.

It will be worth less than when you started.
What cost $1000 in 2002 would cost $1265.62 in [2012]( Who stole 20% of your money? On top of some 30%+ in taxes and "so-called" social security? On top of that, the bubble effect causing things like housing prices skyrocketing 20-30% making everything else more expensive: food, rent prices, groceries, etc. You're being ripped off by the government big time, and you don't realize it.
How do you plan for anything when the dollar is getting absolutely CRUSHED and guaranteed in a negative direction. Whereas, Bitcoins don't lose value due to bad politics - only due to speculation and fear. If I had to choose one, I'll choose the one that at least doesn't have a politically BUILT-IN mechanism for becoming completely worthless.
I've been trying to save money in dollars for years, and what has it gotten me? Practically nothing, because the prices of everything has only increased. Gasoline, housing, rent. I'm constantly falling behind. I can't save for crap in dollars. Bitcoin is a safe haven, if you don't mind *occasional* speculation causing *temporary* dips.

In writing this, I wanted to avoid as much as possible, information that the typical person does not need.
For example, the "Satoshi Nakamoto" thing is completely irrelevant. As much as I respect the creator(s), it doesn't really help someone new.
"Created over time by mathematical equations" is also a bit too detailed for me. It's good enough to just say, "They are created by software" which implies algorithms/mathematics.
Also, the anonymous or psudonymous nature is a complex topic. I would leave that out, and describe it as "increased privacy" (in my second paragraph).
The last paragraph about adoption on the wiki page is a bit wordy, and 2012 is a bit arbitrary of a date. I would avoid linking to the yellow pages except maybe in a separate section (list of bitcoin resources).
And a link to weusecoins.com is probably better.

But then again, people use some of the most sophisticated telecommunication technology in the world (internet) to look at LOLCAT memes. 
So in the end, it makes for a rougher ride, but adoption is adoption and I'd rather have people use it. Doesn't make too much difference since most people still price everything based on USD when accepting bitcoins, rather than the other way around.

Why do we need an Automated Teller Machine? Are there Bank Tellers in Bitcoin? Are there even Banks?

Yes, but if it's truly fluid and nobody is saving coins, then the price would periodically go up or down based on the time between transactions, but ultimately gravitate towards a singular fixed price over time. But if you add speculators and savers and the limited quantity, it does change. But on pure transactional basis, it simply has no effect.
What is the difference between a million people sending bits back and forth between wallets and one person? It's still bits, and it's all the same amount at the end of the day (if we're looking ONLY at transactions). And with BTC extremely divisible, there's no reason why ONLY transactions would change the price.
And so, what is changing the price? Maybe 20-30% of the price is justified by savings + loss of coin. The rest is speculation, and I'm saying, that speculation if attached to transactions (as you seem to be attaching it) is a mathematical error. An exchange of BTC doesn't change the price of BTC if it levels out in the end. And that speculation is risky and nonsensical because you're betting not on growth but on people's desire to hoard coins.

It seems non-trivial to figure out that I'm the second party. 
And even if they do, how can they prove that the transaction was not for something legitimate - say, some used books - from someone who then used it for something illegal.
Do money systems typically make everyone in the chain really liable?
I have bought things on Craigslist to practically complete strangers, using checks and money orders. I have bought things on Ebay to practically complete strangers. If those guys end up spending it on bad things, how can I even know?
So is bitcoin any worse than those existing systems?
Maybe the point is that it is not anonymous and various parties in the transaction can be located and then questioned.
No matter how many intermediaries there are, say, A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E where E is something "bad", and "A" is me, I still end up getting "involved" in this investigation/case where they are trying to trace all of the connections.

Why do you want bitcoin to succeed?
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:05:03
You have not proven to anyone how more transactions results in a higher price.
Let's say 1 BTC is currently valued/priced at $100.
Now, let's say 1000 merchants accept BTC on their store for selling gadgets.
Let's say there's also 1000 customers who all decide to shop at this merchant and buy one of their gadgets. So, they go to the exchanges and start buying. This buy starts to pull the price up, because people are wanting coins.
And those 1000 merchants all make a $100 sale each (1 BTC each). Now, the merchants convert back the BTC to USD onto the market. These sells starts to pull the price back down, because people are dumping coins.
So in the end, we have an equilibrium with all the buyers and sellers balancing each other out. It doesn't matter if you expand this to whatever the "real world" size is. The number of transactions would not affect the price except in some minor differences in perhaps how "urgently" one buyer or seller wanted a coin or the good/service. Their urgency would define at what point in the blip in price change they redeemed their coins.
But overall, the bigger waves will be made by people who are speculating and saving/storing coins (which only has an effect because there are a limited number of coins). There will only be small ripples due to transactions (if there is any kind of equilibrium between buyers and sellers).
I understand in the "real world" there is not a perfect equilibrium and that there are collectors, hoarders, speculators, and all kinds of things changing the price. The point I wanted to make was that the number of transactions (which people get super excited about) in a state of equilibrium (as many people cashing out as buying in) will only have a minor effect on the price of bitcoin. And so many people think that if we do trillions of dollars in transactions (just to BTC and back to USD in balanced fashion) will mean bitcoin will be worth a ton of money -- that just makes no sense. Converting back and forth immediately doesn't make wealth.

Transactions don't hold up the price. If you buy some BTC and sell it a few seconds later, why should the price go in any direction?
I think a lot of BTC are being held, but the amount being held and the amount being transacted do not justify the current price - which indicates to me, that the difference is pure speculation for probably all the wrong reasons (not speculating the future savings goals).
And, like gold, its often not seen as investment, rather, a hedge against a loss of value. Trying to "invest" on people someday "saving a LOT" in order to raise the price is a pretty shoddy investment.

In this scenario:
(1) Exchange [Send 50 BTC] -&gt; (2) Your(?) Bitcoin Address/Wallet [Send 50 BTC] -&gt; (3) Some Stranger
How would anyone know that (2) is me, or a different person? Perhaps I sold person (2) a legitimate item, who then used that money to buy illegal goods. Sure, hands can be followed back to me, but that doesn't really seem like there is anything concrete making me a knowing party in the illegal transaction.
Is that exchange-of-hands connection the "pseudonymity"? Or is there something more than that, in the blockchain or otherwise?
Can my identity linked to the exchange + blockchain activity alone prove that I made all the purchases through the linked transactions?
Could it be proven if, let's say, not only my identity linked to the exchange, but also every wallet I owned was confiscated and I was forced to reveal the passwords to each of my encrypted wallets? Would I then be, for all intents and purposes, be a clear perpetrator in this illegal transaction?

An easy way to secure bitcoins, and still have a convenient method of transferring bitcoins in and out of the secure location. Without the need to understand:
* Live Linux CDs
* Public/Private Key Encryption
* Transaction IDs
* Raw Transaction Files or Signatures
* Key Signing
* Hundreds of technology attack vectors: viruses, keyloggers, spyware, packet sniffing, man-in-the-middle, etc.
* Dealing with a secondary computer
* Dealing with a paper wallet (where do we physically put that, if it contains a very significant amount of money?)
* Dealing with memorizing long, complex passwords
In other words, something both secure and simple. 
I tried to set my friend up with some cold storage, who isn't as saavy as I am, and he got so confused on loading raw transactions and why they needed to be signed and such and why I had to move files using a USB stick and it was such a hassle he said he was going to give up on Bitcoin until this was a lot easier for the layman.

What if a male prostitute and a female prostitute pay each other for sex? Assuming the rate is equal, and the ending balance is $0, could you say that no value was exchanged? Is paying for sex with sex illegal?
Could you prove that a husband didn't pay for sex with love, or that a wife didn't pay for sex with sex in return? These things certainly have "value". Although, the precise value is unclear, and it's hard to know for certain if it was premeditated or agreed upon in advance. In some ways, marriage might be clear advanced knowledge of planning to exchange some forms of value for sex.

Freedom is never handed to you. It is won, through the blood sweat and tears of those willing to take the risks necessary to achieve it.
Bitcoin is a tool. It is an amazing tool. It is a powerful weapon that gives people all the opportunity in the world to take back their freedom. But it won't be used without people getting behind it - without confrontation of those who wish to suppress it.
While it is impossible to generalize entire nations, I believe there are large numbers of Chinese who will use Bitcoin underground - to protect themselves and to get around limits imposed by their government. They have done similar things with other regulation. I believe there are large numbers of Americans who will use Bitcoin - in both a libertarian and revolutionary sense. It's part of the culture and history. I believe there are large numbers of people in all countries ready to use it because it's simply better than any other option, and it's regulation is questionable at best.
The real question for Bitcoin's future is not the cryptography or mainstream ease-of-use, but whether or not there are enough people willing to take a risk and use it despite totalitarian measures to stop it (and their blatantly ignorant excuses to regulate it). I don't know if there are enough people. Too many people live in fear. But when pushed to the brink of helplessness, hunger, and despair -- even the most modest animal can reveal the ferocity of its teeth.

I wonder if difficulty is a leading indicator of prices.
As people have more confidence and more willingness to mine for bitcoins in a situation where current prices do not justify the work, they are mining to a future valuation. 
If that's the case, we may be in for a price rise that matches the look of that chart. That would be impressive!

Young people have the rest of their life to try to repair the damage. I wouldn't recommend such a risk for someone close to retirement. That being said, given how fast it is rising, even a small $1,000 investment could turn into something that will help significantly. I would not overdo it.

Disconnecting when not making transactions isn't enough, you want it disconnected ALL THE TIME. Once it's connected, you don't know what viruses, trojans, keyloggers weasel their way onto it, or maybe someone exploiting some other OS vulnerability - but in the end, they have to "network" their way through. If you keep an air gap, you'll be safer.

Hindsight is 20/20. Focus on the "New Reality" rather than what you wish things were or what you hope things will be.
The only thing that matters is that today's price is X. And if you expect it to go to X+1, you should buy more. Nothing that happened before should affect the decision you make now - only the current, active variables.

I tried to explain bitcoin to my extended family over thanksgiving dinner and they just mocked me. Then I told them I got some at $60 a piece and now they are worth $1200. Then they suddenly got excited and asked me where to buy some. I swear, people are way too predictable. If you're buying because you're greedy and want to use it like some kind of get-rich scheme, I don't have a lot of patience. My motivations are political. Unfortunately, the average Joe doesn't give a rat's ass about politics and only hears, "Money? I can make money? Money? Profit???".

That is sort of my initial question. What would make it false? Video surveillance? Confiscation of computers that I own? I'm not really sure. What I imagine is that *IF* there is no other connecting evidence, then it's pretty hard to prove that any given address (other than at the exchange) is me.
So if I always use a new wallet address intermediary for every transaction, and never split coins to an identifying receiver, there will always be a layer that is hard to target. 
Not to say that through suspicion, authorities might put surveillance on someone and then try to put 2 and 2 together, but where the connection is made is my original question and confusion.

everything is exchanging... let's say i gave the cashier at subway BTC to buy a sandwich, and he pocketed the BTC and whipped out $USD of his own and then deposited it into the cash register... does it "count"? what if instead of the cashier, it was BitPay and they converted it to $USD? Does it still "count"? i'm not sure what you mean by purely off bitcoin - eventually people exchange it to something else, because you can't eat bitcoins...

A lot of discussion here about whether regulation is good or bad, but I feel like everyone (including the writer on forbes.com) is missing a bigger point. What is being regulated? Numbers? Bitcoins boil down to nothing more than numbers in a digital system. To say to one person that they cannot give numbers to another person is preposterous. Or to try to regulate a so-called bitcoin "exchange" where people trade these numbers among each other. What does that even mean? And if you're saying it's not the number thats important, rather, the value of it, then are we saying people do not even have the right to communicate anything of value? And thus, a government should have control over what you have to say to anyone? I'm not an economics expert or a civil rights expert or constitutional expert, but something feels really wrong about a government that wants to regulate public information or the processing of it.

Hey, do you or anyone else here know where I can print out a cool infographic or colorful guide for beginners? I want to hand them out together with the bitcoin.
I wish this guide included links to popular sites that accept bitcoin. And where to buy more bitcoin. And a small chart tracking the history of the price, to see what potentially it can go to. 
It would be great to also provide quotes from government officials and prominent figures, talking about the legitimacy and strengths of the bitcoin.
Nothing too dense or dramatic. Just practical and educational.

I remember a trick to memorizing words that I used to impress my friends. First, come up with a public set of distinct words that are assigned by number.
1. one = won
2. two = shoe
3. three = tree
4. four = floor
5. five = hive
6. six = sticks
7. seven = heaven
8. eight = bait
9. nine = wine
10. ten = pen
11. eleven = elven
12. twelve = shelve
Once you have associated the number with the word, which should be pretty easy if it rhymes (or you can write it down permanently) then you come up with a mental picture that combines that word with your seed word.
1. won + engine = fastest car engine won the race
2. shoe + actually = it's actually hard to tie a shoe fast
3. tree + completely = trees completely fill the forest
4. floor + grow = drop the seeds on the garden floor and watch them grow
5. hive + seek = don't play hide-and-seek near the beehive
6. sticks + pocket = is that a stick in your pocket or are you happy to see me?
7. heaven + brother = my brother's an ass, he ain't going to heaven
8. bait + came = the fisherman came, baited his line, and fished all day
9. wine + everybody = served wine at dinner, everyone loved it
10. pen + nerve = he poked me with a pen, it struck a nerve
11. elves + guide = the elves were a guide to frodo baggings on this quest
12. shelve + peach = i stored many jars of peach jam on the shelves
Now, if you study the sentences the number+rhyme should trigger the sentences. For example, 9. wine ... start picturing a gathering with friends &amp; family drinking wine, bit group, group of ... everybody. The ninth word is wine.
Human memory isn't perfect though, so I wouldn't solely rely on it for securing huge amounts of wealth.

The US has a lot of political power to force other countries to do what they want. The US basically owns all the money, because they print it, and every other country is based off of it. If cries of terrorism and money laundering doesn't force international exchanges to shut down, I'm pretty sure the US can use military presence in practically every country to "persuade" them to close their exchanges. They have a lot of power to stop it, and in the end, the technology can help us but only human courage against tyranny can set us free.

I think you are overstating the actual potential of Bitcoin. Yes, it's pretty cool, but I see it as a useful way to perform transactions while gold, land, and other things of limited quantity protect value (and has for centuries). We've had these things for thousands of years and anyone can buy gold or land today. It doesn't make sense that suddenly, with Bitcoin, all of that gets toppled over. Those things have proven themselves across all sorts of global change, political change, new governments, new countries, etc. It's hard to debate that kind of true longevity.
Looking at Bitcoin, it's interesting that it has become popular - but it's a self-feeding prophecy that doesn't really mean it can't all disappear. It's popular because it's popular. But the reality is, some other cryptocurrency can come along that is superior in some way - maybe it adds additional safeguards so the common person doesn't accidentally lose coins or get hacked - maybe it supports a more efficient blockchain - maybe it is just better in some other unknown, new way. Bitcoin is really just 1.0 beta. There's a long ways to go before the Facebook of virtual currency is born, and it will take a lot of trial and error.
I'm not saying Bitcoin doesn't have potential. It certainly does. I support it everyday, I tell my friends about it. I want to see it go mainstream. I'd like to see corrupt governments and corrupt bankers all topple from it. But things are not going to be total a disaster for anyone except those who have chosen to live in ignorance. I have no sympathy for those who have decided with their own free will to not understand and accept the principles that frees people from tyranny.
I do not see chaos, except for the most corrupt and the most ignorant - neither of which we really need anymore in this world. If I ever become a Bitcoin billionaire or trillionaire, plenty of that will go into social programs and the kinds of efforts that will help the lower class in ways that governments could never do. And so, what I see is a profound peace. The only ones screaming and fear-mongering will be those in power, but it will be an unstoppable force that will gradually silence them over time. It was power they never deserved in the first place, and would only be right for them to lose. But this will happen over the course of so many decades, it will be hard to really tell anything changed until we look back at it all.
Things won't be that different. And if anything is different, it will be more peaceful.
