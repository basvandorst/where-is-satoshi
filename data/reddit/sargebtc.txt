Best brand, largest miner and business support, 7 years of flawless execution.

Agreed. Bitcoin is sound money, Paypal is payment processor. They are not competitors at all.

sweet! another thing i've noticed is app crashes each time i touch a lock icon.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:07:11
They've missed Bitcoin completely and now they think they can define it? LOL
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:52:49
it seems like "consensus" is rapidly becoming just another meaningless buzzword.
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:17:49
frankly i find coins stuff to be of little use but overall your app is stable and usable i guess i'll keep it for a while at least. here's a feature request: i happen to run two full nodes on vps servers and it would be nice if i could instruct wallet to connect to them only.

Keynesian endgame is at hand.
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:24:33
Too dangerous a scenario I'm afraid. There might be nothing left to fix by that time.
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:59:07
it crashes completely and i see an error message in a popup.

Even a stronger statement can be made: LN transactions are real Bitcoin transactions which don't go to blockchain immediately but instead passed back and forth (but they can be placed to blockchain at any moment if some party refuses to cooperate).

The trick is it's never _that_ specific bitcoin which person B got from person A. It's different bitcoin which belongs to a B/C channel, not A/B channel but thankfully money is fungible.
In general, do you understand how payment channel works technically? If not, take some time and learn about it, it's an interesting stuff. If you understand the mechanics of a single payment channel, a conceptual leap to a network is not too hard.
@_date: 2016-02-12 16:40:11
Yes, the whole system would not have been very useful otherwise. Basically LN is a series of payment channels between person A and C and each payment channel along the way does allow nearly unlimited bidirectional transactions, especially with upcoming OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (relative lock-time ensures a payment channel can stay opened for an unlimited amount of time, until one of the parties decides to break it).

This is really disappointing as I've had high hopes for this wallet. Anyway, their "reusable payment codes" tech still looks promising, let's hope they'll deliver it as advertised so more decentralised wallets could take it, too.
@_date: 2016-02-12 22:35:16
Block limits will still have to be raised, especially if LN takes off seriously. But there are some important optimizations which need to be done before limits could be safely bumped.
@_date: 2016-02-12 20:01:08
your guess is completely wrong.

B can't possibly give C _that exact bitcoin_ he earlier gave to D because _that exact bitcoin_ is locked in B/D multisig address which is a basis for B/D channel.
I'll go with an analogy: imagine you're A and you want to give C one golden coin. You call B and ask him to transfer your coin to C. In real world B can just give C your original coin or he can keep it and give C another golden coin of equal value that he already has. The latter is roughly what happens when payment travels from A to B and then from B to C in LN.

yes, it moves signature data out of transaction body so signature has no influence on transaction's hash any more.

A mere fact that Apple does not WANT to decrypt a phone means they have encryption keys for every device. Combined with automatic updates and closed source code the only valid conclusion is to never use Apple device to store bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-02-11 12:29:51
Great news, I'm happy with this.
@_date: 2016-02-12 12:07:24
Well I haven't met one yet (I'm kinda new here) but as far as I understand they claim LN is centralized in a sense that there won't be too many "payment processor" nodes (those with a lot of active payment channels from end users), perhaps a few dozens or even less. 
I tend to agree with that but don't think it's a problem because we have cryptographic guarantees (worst thing imaginable happens and we still retain our bitcoins by "grounding" a transaction into blockchain). My humble opinion is it's not a kind of centralization that can hurt anyone.

Should let the dev know then. I'll point him to this thread.
@_date: 2017-07-16 05:05:36
How come? The wallet is connecting to one UASF and two Core nodes and nothing else by default. Not ideal since one have to largely trust a developer now but does not it actually protect from hard forked coins?
