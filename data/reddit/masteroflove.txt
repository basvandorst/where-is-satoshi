Unless you were using the newest version of Tails 1.2, visiting  almost any site over SSL would be vulnerable to the recent poodle exploit, which renders everything in plaintext to an attacking exit node.  You can check if your browser is vulnerable here:

After 1 hour of no blocks found, Eligius just mined a block with 2000+ transactions as well.

Just a reminder everyone: 
Inputs.io is a shared wallet that manages your balance and private keys.  They have access to all the bitcoins you store with them.  
Blockchain.info on the other hand is a "Be Your Own Bank" bitcoin wallet.  Your account access is secured by your identifier / alias, password, and two factor if you choose to enable it. Even if the site shutdown, your bitcoins can be accessed by your password and backups made by the service.   The most important part is using a virus free secure computer and a complex long password.  
It's not foolproof though, if the blockchain.info domain is compromised, the hacker can serve malicious javascript that will record your passwords and can get access to all your bitcoins.  That's why is it recommend to use the Chrome or Firefox blockchain app.  But even this isn't 100% foolproof as an attacker that gains access to blockchains credentials can push a malicious update that will automatically update on your browser apps.
It is important to keep most of your balance in an offline cold storage address, with a few copies.  Head over to  on a linux live USB/CD, disconnect the internet, create a paper wallet on the second tab, and use BIP38 Encrpytion with a long complex passphrase.  Save a screenshot to a USB, print a copy, email one to yourself.  There you go, secured :-)

Lifespan isn't infinite for cheap CD-R (10 years) or USB keys (a couple thousands removals).  Multiple encrypted backups is the best solution. I personally use brainwallets and have no backups, but that is too advanced for most users and good way for something to go wrong.

Great question. To make it easier for others to understand, pretend bitaddress is serving you an address from "very very long list".  While the address may look random to you, it is actually just one in a million in this list that a hacker can easily check for balances later. 
This is hard to detect unless you can look through the source of the file.  Same problem with bitcoin software wallets too, we have to trust the source of the binary that it is using random numbers to generate address.  Note, there hasn't been any major issues with any of the clients in generating unique new random address.
My personal solution is to use brainwallets (novice users please do not use these).  
I get both brainwallet.org and bitaddress.org saved offline.  Then I make sure that the input for my brainwallet produces the same addresses on both sites.

BIP38 Encrpytion is secure enough with a long enough password.  There was a challenge offered on bitcointalk.  The encrypted private key was posted with BTC inside of it. And I think no one was able to steal the 8 character plus ones.  You should still be using 20 chars+ imo.
Of course, if you are familiar with truecrypt, and want to save a regular wallet using that, go head, but I don't think most live boot linux come with truecrypt preinstalled.

Someone just posted a BIP38 wallet with a 3 character password! Let's see what happens

Printscreen save as image or print to pdf, save to USB, and print later.

It's not so user friendly to select and copy the private keys from the paper wallet generated on bitaddress at the moment, as the text runs vertical. Just wanted to make sure basic users don't miss a character or two.  If you are sure you got the whole encrypted private key, then pasting it a text file will suffice.

Git Hub doesn't get updated with the newest source. It's over a month old.

Someone can find your paper wallet or USB key too and try to brute force those too.  With a long complex password for encryption, sending it to your email is not an issue.  Given 3 years, the USB can be corrupted and the paper wallet will be lost, but usually the one on email or dropbox will be easy to find.
