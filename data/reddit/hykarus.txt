His salary ? He is the 2nd richest man on the planet and is 90y old, you think he gives a fuck about losing a bit of money right now ?     
You're delusional

You're insulting the resolve and love of literally billions of people but ok.   
Just because your mariage failed. FeelsBadMan

I'm not trying to roast you, i'm trying to help you

Your vision is bleak, I feel sorry for you

Being a non-native speaker, I am immune to any kind of r/iamverysmart criticism, sorry. However you definitely need to realize that your remark wouldn't fly anywhere in any kind of formal context (or informal for that matter).

Be less of a stuck up sexist dick and we can talk

It's OK, understanding is secondary, doing your best is what matters. Gambatte dude

Yes. Real life isn't about arguments.  It isn't about logic. It's about belief. Just like you believe marriage is bad. You chose to lock yourself in your hatred of marriage. No "argument" will change your view of it, because it's a belief based in your own experience.

Yet your first reaction to OP's post is for no apparent reason that she gonna cheat on him. But sure, no problem
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:15:49
That's a statistic. It doesn't mean anything to someone in particular

Yeah, and my parents have been happily married for 30+ years, so were my grandparents and their parents before that. And all of them would have been less happy without marriage. What's your point ?
@_date: 2019-04-10 21:01:20
Yet I did challenge your own experience with mine. But does it matter ? You obviously are prejudiced against marriage. You do you mate. While you weep in sadness, thousands of people marry everyday and live a long and happy married life.

Unfortunately, it seems that your definition of sexism is quite plain and basic and does not encompass fully what sexism is today

I... are y'all joking or just extremely sociopathic ? Get out of your basements and see the world, there's more to it than bitcoin charts you know ?
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:42:01
Yes, because it is a concrete proof of their love and engagement. Seems like not that you would understand, though
