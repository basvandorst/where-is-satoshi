So... you're suggesting it would be better to lie to my child?
I don't care if he gets any other donations, but the donations he got today could turn into a life lesson that he doesn't have to settle for a job he hates. He can do what he loves and provide value to others and they will thank him for it with their own store of value. That's an awesome lesson!
It's sad to me that some view the title as offensive or it immediately lumps me into what others have done. Let the site speak for itself. There are 6 posts already written and ready to publish and if Devon remains interested, we'll make more. I see no problem at all with putting a donation button on there. The games are free and it's completely voluntary for everyone involved.
@_date: 2014-06-29 23:30:50
I'm sorry you see the world that way. I've been building games with him for about a month now and wanted to share his excitement with everyone else. The games are currently free.
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:33:08
You're assuming I'm some how profiting off my child in some sick, pan-handling way. My original goal was for Devon to earn a few satoshi's of his own so he could get excited about the idea of providing value for others while doing something he enjoys. These are his bitcoins, not mine. If anyone who has donated feels they were taken advantage of, how come they aren't complaining? Many feel this is a fantastic idea and shows people what's possible with bitcoin. You have every right to disagree, but my son is super excited about the bitcoin he now owns and that to me is a wonderful thing.

Couldn't the same argument be made about electricity? Transistors? Etc, etc? Just because one technology is built on top of another doesn't automatically make it less of a disruption. It's about the end result and we're still in the very early stages of Bitcoin.

My lightbulb moment was March 11th, 2013 when the blockchain forked. Up until then, it was a theoretical concern often debated in bitcointalk.org. I saw a tweet nine minutes after it happened. I jumped into IRC and watched everything unfold in real time until 2:30am. It amazed me to see each individual acting in their own self interest which also matched the interest of the entire network. It blew me away. No corporation or government could respond as quickly as these developers, exchanges and mining pools did. Within hours, everything was back up and running. I was amazed. Decentralized, open source technology really works and will change the world.

This is great news! My company (FoxyCart.com) made this possible by integrating with Bitpay last April. I hope more of our stores follow their lead. We've blogged about it and emailed all our stores trying to get more of them to set it up. If we can build a good case study here, maybe more stores will get onboard. Show them some love, reddit!
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:42:01
Bitcoin is amazing for multiple reasons. The blockchain and the currency could both change the world. To understand that, people need an understanding of money and a sense of what's wrong with the current system (i.e. central banking). Tapping into the zeitgeist of our times would be my vote. Since 2008, people know things are broken, but they still don't know what money is. They don't know how broken things are. I'm not saying you have to go all libertarian, I'm just saying the world needs to be educated about why bitcoin is so revolutionary. If we just focus on the technical aspects then it can be ignored as a "better Paypal" which no one cares about until their daily merchants start accepting it. If we tap into the feeling they already have about the corruption all around them and position bitcoin as the solution, that is something worth paying attention to. I did a small talk along these lines at a Barcamp unconference and it was well received. The YouTube video has quite a few viewings also: 
Many of us are excited about bitcoin because we believe it can change the world and play a significant role in the future. That's the contagious idea. In order to spread it, we have to communicate what needs to be changed and how that will happen for the benefit of everyone.
@_date: 2014-03-30 04:49:46
It's not just about transmitting money. It's about controlling your own store of value with no third party risk. People in countries experiencing hyperinflation, capital controls and bank bail-ins better understand the implications of Bitcoin. Since 1971, the USD is pure fiat and since 1944, the nations of the world have pegged to the dollar as the world reserve currency. I've read that fiat currencies have an average life span of 27 years (there have been over 700 of them and eventually they all lose value). If 2008 was just a glimpse of what could happen to world financial markets, Bitcoin could create an entirely new way to structure financial systems. Removing centralized (and often corrupted) third parties and replacing them with cryptography is a really big deal. The nice thing about my claims is neither of us has to convince the other one. Time will tell. :)

I posted the site to the Scratch subreddit first, but I thought the bitcoin community would be excited about the idea also. It highlights how you don't need permission from anyone to provide value to others. It's educational, teaching children about what I believe to be the money of the future. We've been building these games for fun (and will continue to do so), but putting up the website, sharing it with others, and accepting bitcoin donations was something Devon was really excited about and I thought the community would be excited also.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:37:01
That sounds like a great idea!

Well done! I've been looking for something simple like this. I added it to my blog post today:

Glad to see our little meetup group getting some love in the papers. I'm curious, what are other meetup groups doing to get attention in your city? We have a Facebook group that has also been really helpful for building community. The print version of this article apparently also included a list of the local businesses we've talked to which are now accepting bitcoin. Pretty cool. :)
@_date: 2014-03-29 13:36:11
My first purchase was at $20. I also bought at $1,000. I remember watching the price drop from $266 to $50 last year and I didn't sell (though I did buy at $50). I sold a good portion at $180 which I obviously regret. I decided I'm no good at timing things in the short term so I'm done selling (though I do exchange for goods and services). I've bought as much as my budget will allow (or I'd be buying more now). For me to buy more, I'd need to increase my income, which I'm working on (along those lines, if you need eCommerce that also accepts Bitcoin, support FoxyCart).
I've given presentations on why I think Bitcoin will be more disruptive than the Internet. If I was given the opportunity to invest in the Internet itself and benefit from any future valuation of it, that would have been an obvious decision. As Marc Andreessen says, this is 1975 for personal computers or 1993 for the Internet. We're in the early days.

Having worked for Dave for almost 4 years (and emailing him personally about Bitcoin a year ago), I wrote an open letter about this: 
@_date: 2014-03-30 04:32:13
That's surprising to hear, as we're often told we provide really great value. Our standard annual plan is $15 a month for up to 100 transactions. After that, the most you'll pay is 15 cents per transaction. If you're in the advanced plan it includes 1,000 transactions and only 5 cents each obove that. The developer's we've talked to haven't been happy with ejunkie, but if it meets your needs, I'm glad you found a solution. I'm sorry we couldn't serve you because your magnets are awesome.
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:25:23
Wow, thank you! We got two donations already and he's pretty excited.
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:39:50
Sorry, I thought of it differently. I told my friends, "Hey look, I'm doing this thing which I think is really cool and because I know you, I think you'll think it's cool also. Let's up vote it so it gets some visibility."
That was my motivation and intention. Many have encouraged me and shared my excitement. Others are offended. Either way, I'll still create games with my son, offer them for free and hope others engage in the process of learning how to build games and spend quality time with their kids. Every donation that comes in for Devon is a bonus for him. He and I share hi-fives about it and it's pretty exciting. He does chores around the house for dimes so the amount bitcoin he has now is pretty amazing. More than I imagined.
@_date: 2014-06-30 02:50:44
For many of the 7 games we've built so far, he sat on my lap and contributed ideas, color suggestions, and letter by letter typed out some of the variables. (Side note: that takes some serious patience. I would say "We need a variable to keep score. Let's call it 'score'." Okay, S... hunt... peck... C... hunt... peck...).
It's about ownership. When we take out the trash together, I still do most of the lifting, but he does contribute something and "we" take out the trash. He has some ownership and I believe that's important.
As he gets older (and if he's still as interested in this as he is now), I think he will be making games all on his own. Until then, I have no problem at all putting up a donation button and providing a platform for others to teach their kids how to build games.
@_date: 2014-06-29 23:44:45
Wow! Thank you! This is for my son, not me, so I just sent that along to his address: 
I'm so stoked at the generosity I'm seeing. I expected maybe to get fifty cents or something and make a big deal out of it with Devon. We have almost $20 worth of BTC! Crazy! Some startups raising VC don't have this much revenue. Haha. That's funny right there.

It's been a while since I read the reddiquette. I honestly did not know it was against the rules to ask for votes from people who follow me and like the story, but I see now that was a mistake. I've just deleted the tweet. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
@_date: 2014-06-29 23:36:29
We've built 7 games already. I never planned to build a business for Devon out of it, but now I'm really excited about it! I run my own business and don't need anyone's emotional responses. Teaching him at an early age about providing value to others is an awesome thing, IMO. He's super excited about other people playing the games we built together.
Beats selling lemonade on the sidewalk. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 01:54:04
You didn't answer my previous question about adding a donation button. Did that make what I'm doing wrong? Also, are you mad at those who donated or me for making donating available so I can not only teach my son about gaming, but also about providing value to others in voluntary exchange?
For a 5 year old, I'm super impressed with the effort he's put into this. He does it because it's fun and he wants to learn more about what I do on the computer all day. You say it doesn't further his education, but I completely disagree. Being educated on how you can get paid for doing work you love is, imo, one of the most important lessons in life which few people ever learn.
And no, I didn't tweet at a news channel. I tweeted at a single reporter at the Tennessean who has been to our Nashville Bitcoin meetups and has done a few stories on the bitcoin scene here in Nashville. I thought she would enjoy a comment which has now been deleted. If this turned into the next Caine's Arcade ( would that be a bad thing? I think that would be fabulous for my son, for bitcoin, and for everyone inspired by the story. Granted, he's not old enough (yet) to build these games by himself, but my hope is he will be some day. We've been doing this for less than a month.
I was home schooled and we are homeschooling him also. I have a deep love for learning. I also believe in voluntary exchange of value. If he learns at a young age that he can do something he loves while providing a means to obtain the things he wants, that's fantastic, IMO.
I appreciate your concern for my son. If you're truly concerned, follow the blog for a while and see how "exploited" he is in the videos we've already recorded of him enjoying the games we made.
Btw, I have done some study on motivational psychology and I do understand the concept of being punished by rewards related to creative endeavors. I don't think that applies here because he intrinsicly enjoys playing and making the games. Maybe that will change in time... we will see. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:40:48
Which is more disruptive, a voice or your own store of value which can be exchanged with anyone else in the world for free, no matter how corrupt your government or central bank is? My perspective comes from understanding the history of money (you can see the presentation here:  ). I'm not the only one who has made that claim (see thoughts from Chris Dixon, Marc Andreessen, etc.. are they a joke also?)
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:29:58
If you're not ready to go all in with bitcoin (i.e. you want to acxept credit cards also), you could go with a shopping cart software that accepts both payment methods. My company  for example, lets you accept multiple payment methods (bitcoin, Dwolla, Paypal, credit card, etc).
Another thing to keep in mind, if you use systems like bitpay (which we integrate with) lets you convert directly to your currency of choice if you don't want the currency volatility risk. Good luck and thanks for growing the merchant community!

Thank you! I'm not really a fan of the altcoins based on the research I've done so far, but I really appreciate the gesture. I don't have any other dogecoins on reddit, so I'll remember these are his. I really do appreciate it. Many are passionate about their favorite coins and time will tell as to where the value ends up. I like Andreas' perspective that currencies could become like language where we could have thousands of new ones and we each could use our currency of choice as a means of expression and seamlessly exchange back and forth into the ones we prefer. For now, I'm working to explain bitcoin to him. Altcoins will come after that if they are still around in a few years. :)
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:09:24
Very well done!
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:34:36
I have 6 more posts to publish but I didn't want to put them all up right away. I'll probably post one every few days over the next week or two. I talk a bit more about him in those posts, but mainly he's the creative inspiration as far as what we should build, what to add, and what colors to use. Sometimes he overrides my suggestions. :)
Often times he wants to type out the variable names himself and since he can't read yet, I tell him one letter at a time what to type. It's a painfully slow process of hunt and peck.
My hope is as we build more games and if he stays interested in them, he will eventually learn to build his own creations entirely. He's starting to get more comfortable with Minecraft, so I'm seeing some of that happen already.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:30:11
Did you even look at the site? I didn't claim my son built these games by himself. We built them together as I teach him. It's been awesome! I hope someday he does continue with this current passion of his and do them himself, but if he loses interest, then that will be the end of it. I'm not scamming anyone or lying to anyone. Some people here need to redirect their righteous anger towards things that matter. I've found a fun way to spend time with my son and I'm sharing it for free for everyone to join in. I also put up a donation button so he could gain his first bitcoin. He's excited about that. It's unfortunate this offends you.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:37:48

Please let me know if you have any questions. We have 6 other games I'll post over the next week or so.
@_date: 2014-06-29 23:32:00
For giving away free games he had fun making?
@_date: 2014-06-30 01:38:28
Thanks! Yes, you can totally do this on a laptop and everything to get started is free. You can download Scratch directly from the MIT website. I put this page together today on the site and there's a link there to get it. It's in the menu next to "About" called "Getting Started": 
There are a lot of Scratch gaming tutorials out there and plenty on YouTube also. I've been building websites since 1996, so much of it comes naturally to me, but the concepts aren't that difficult. Scratch makes it super easy. I'm starting with attempting to rebuild games I was familiar with as a kid and will hopefully get more creative as Devon and I explore different ideas. We have a firefighter helicopter game that was completely his idea and it's pretty neat.
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:38:46
Neither do many journalists. :) It's all a matter of degrees. Devon understands it's something daddy talks about a lot and it has something to do with money and the Nashville Bitcoin meetup he goes to once a month.
I just told him he got his first bitcoin and showed him the blockchain info site. He got all excited and then said, "but where is it?" Heheh. He's relating it to the dimes we give him for emptying the silverware in the dishwasher, most likely. In time, he'll understand and he'll probably get it more than most because he started so young. I'm stoked to give him an early start.
An no, he doesn't need a full bitcoin, though if he did start gaining real money, we'd certainly help him save it and use it wisely. There are 100,000,000 satoshis in each coin, so no worries there.
@_date: 2014-06-30 02:37:46
Yes, you can run this on any laptop. You don't need a Raspberry Pi at all. That's been super fun for him because it's his own computer, and he is building games with dad on it which he can play whenever he wants so that creates more of a love for computing in general.
I created a "Getting Started" page on the site today which should get you started. It's really as simple as installing Scratch (the link to the MIT website is in that post) and then saving the .sb file to your computer and running it.
Let me know if you have any questions.
@_date: 2014-06-29 23:29:40
I run my own successful business and have no need for begging. We're currently giving all the games away for free and have already developed 7 of them. He does care and I talked to him about all of these before doing it. We'll do more videos together. Sure he may lose interest, but right now he's excited.
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:28:19
That would be fantastic. Maybe we could have a Bitcoin version of Caine's Arcade! I'm hoping this journey will be along one and we'll be able to look back on it many years from now and smile. Whatever he decides to spend the money on will be posted on the blog. He already does jobs around the house for dimes. :)
@_date: 2014-06-30 00:38:18
I don't see adding a donation button as begging. I'm not only teaching him about building games, but also about market forces and providing value to other people. The donations aren't for me, as I've said above. I run my own business and have been (and will continue) to do this on the weekend for fun. If my son earns some bitcoin through the process of us having fun, I'm all about that. If you disapprove, I'm sorry your perception of my motivations offends you.
@_date: 2014-06-30 02:34:53
Thanks. Me too. If not, hopefully he'll find something else he loves to do even more.
@_date: 2014-06-30 00:33:22
So if there was no donation button on there, you'd be fine with it? If there is a donation button, everything is cynical and evil? I don't believe providing value in voluntary exchange is evil. Devon and I did this for weeks on our own for fun and we will continue to do it for fun. He and I discussed the idea of sharing the games with others, and he was really excited about the idea. He's also really excited about getting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-29 23:39:05
It's his money. I have my own business. If you think I did this in order to steal from my 5 year old... well, I can't do much to change your view of the world. We already built 7 games, and I have 6 other blog posts I worked on this weekend. We will build more as long as we both enjoy it. Currently they are all for free.
@_date: 2014-06-30 01:30:00
Do you have kids? Do you think an allowance is better than voluntary jobs where they get paid based on the value they contribute?
This website of Devon's own business has been in existence for one single day. We've built 7 games over the past month and I wrote up the blog posts about them. I plan to do this with him for as long as he's excited about it. He's sat on my lap, and I've spelled out variable names for him to type in. For some of the if, forever, and conditional blocks, he dragged them over himself. All but one of the games were build on his own Raspberry Pi. This is about ownership and he feels it. We've talked all day today about "his" website. He's super excited about it. It may not be a business for him yet, but it made him $20 bucks already. That's more revenue than some startups in SV will ever see. If he loses interest, so be it. If not, he'll learn little by little with every game we build until eventually (if he wants to), he might be building them completely on his own.
As a father, I see nothing but things to celebrate here.
I wish you would have built something in that woodshop people wanted to donate to. That might have changed your entire outlook on providing value and human generosity. As it is, you seem to feel it's more important to hate on something fun going on.
@_date: 2014-06-30 01:56:50
Well, it's gone now, but it was a really encouraging comment which included Devon's bitcoin address and a hope this gets picked up by the media. I tweeted to someone I know who writes for the Tennessean because of that comment, but now that tweet seems silly.
@_date: 2016-03-18 03:39:59
Are you already accepting traditional online payments? If so, I'll shamelessly plug my company FoxyCart which integrates with over 90 payment gateways including BitPay and Coinbase. We've been supporting and blogging about bitcoin since 2013. We try to make it easier for businesses to get involved by making it just another payment option during the checkout process. Those who want to use it can, and those who want traditional methods like PayPal, Amazon, or Credit Card can go that route also. Nice thing is there's no coding needed since we've already done that. Either way, glad to hear of more businesses wanting make bitcoin an option. Good luck!
@_date: 2015-07-19 05:36:02
I was sad to not see FoxyCart in there. I'll send an email. We've been trying to make it easy for online merchants to add bitcoin to their existing payment options (Amazon, PayPal, Dwolla, Credit Card, etc) but the uptake has been really slow. We wrote multiple blog posts about it and started emailing our users in 2013, but very few bothered to create a BitPay or Coinbase account and turn it on. We're not going anywhere though so when merchants are ready to accept bitcoin, hopefully they'll turn to us. :)
Keep up the great work.

I like the Keiser Report. Been watching it for a while, and he's one of the few people talking openly about the "financial terrorism" taking place by the central planning banksters. That said, I'm disappointed in his recent LTC, QRK pump and dump activity. I tweeted this at him and got blocked for my trouble:  Since Stacy follows me on Twitter, and we've had some good discussions, I was curious what she'd say:  I guess I'm just needy. :) Either way, he's toned down the LTC/QRK talk on Twitter lately, and I'm happy about that. It will be interesting to see if he still has Bill Still on the show to pump QRK.

Please, people. 1Password all the things. Don't ever reuse your passwords. Don't waste brain power on trying to come up with them either. The first thing I teach people who want to get into Bitcoin is about security, antivirus, and using an encrypted, backed up password management software suite. Add to that some dual factor authentication and you're good to go.

If you or your developer is looking for a shopping cart that accepts Bitcoin (along with 50+ other payment gateways), give us a look: 
We also accept Bitcoin as payment for our services and offer a 5% discount. Let's get some more stores accepting Bitcoin!

"Nope, a well thought out &lt;strike&gt;long&lt;/strike&gt; short term &lt;strike&gt;strategy&lt;/strike&gt; lie is in place."
Surprises me the price didn't drop back down once people realized $1M wasn't being put into the system. I guess this post got people to buy who were on the fence about the $47 range. Now that it appears to be holding, I wish I had also.

My favorite quote:


@_date: 2013-03-25 16:36:22
FoxyCart and e-junkie are similar in that neither of them is a full website / CMS. FoxyCart is built to integrate (API, Single Sign On, Unified Order Entry, etc) and offers a lot of flexibility while eliminating data duplication, but e-junkie handles your inventory, affiliate stuff, etc. We focus on having the best cart and checkout process available and let integrations handle the rest (such as FoxyShop for Wordpress). E-junkie tries to be a little more than that and for some people that's great, for others it creates limitations they have trouble working around. As developers, we like the FoxyCart approach of just doing one thing well and integrating with everything else.

For those in the US: I was actually able to purchase a coin via coinbase last night. Over the past week or two, every attempt gave me the "Sorry, we've gone above our rolling 24h limit" message. I wonder if they increased their supply? Might be worth giving them a try.
Also, for fun, I did the bitinstant method yesterday as well. I paid $103.95 (ZipZap charges $3.95), in order to get $96.01 worth of coin (bitinstant takes 3.99%). I think they use the mtgox API behind the scenes which probably took their 0.6% as well. I did get coin in less than 30 minutes though. It was pretty cool to get a blockchain.info alert on my phone on the ride home. :)

So... Dwolla has been down for quite some time. That's the primary way for people in the US to get money into Mt Gox. Do I need to reach for a tin hat?

Thanks! My first ever bitcointip. :) Fitting since I tipped someone for the first time last week.

We (FoxyCart.com) recently integrated support with Bitpay (we're a shopping cart provider) and we also set things up so we could accept Bitcoins ourselves. We currently offer a 5% discount. If you're looking for a shopping cart solution that supports Bitcoin, give us a look. So far, we haven't had anyone take us up on the offer.
@_date: 2013-06-21 12:23:00
If soon turns into not so soon, keep in mind [there are other options]( We added support and also allow users to pay for their service in Bitcoin (we give a discount as well). Sadly no one has decided to pay us in BTC (yet).

The last two debates I've heard of Peter's had him rudely inturrupting the hosts. I hope emotions can be set aside for this one so some rational discussion can take place. I think anyone against fiat is basically on the same team trying to help people.

I'm trying to keep an open mind. I really am. I'm learning daily about the various opinions on altcoins and their place in the world of crypto currencies. One thing is for sure, there are a lot of opinions.
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:05:41
Great list! My addition would be to install something like 1Password or Lastpass (I'm assuming they already have a good antivirus installed and regularly updating). I think teaching the importance of security and proper password usage is critical to bitcoin ownership.

Bitpay eliminates all currency exchange risk, so no, you are incorrect. Please spread your FUD elsewhere. Those who have been following Bitcoin (the protocol) for more than a few months understand price volatility of bitcoins (the currency) is expected and will persist for months and even years as adoption grows.

Thanks cornrow. We have a lot of features I (and the team) have spent the last 5+ years building, so if you run into specifics you don't feel like messing with (PCI compliance, coupons, subscriptions, downloadables, live shipping rates, live tax rates, web hooks, API access, etc), keep us in mind. :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:16:56
Who else thinks this will be all over the news soon? The haters are always looking for more mud to sling. I feel bad for how this may negatively impact merchants. Increased merchant adoption is the main thing Bitcoin needs right now and this may scare some away.

I explain the purpose of the title in this HN comment: 
The talk was selected and a bunch of people learned about Bitcoin who wouldn't otherwise know about it.
Also, CNN Money said basically the same thing yesterday "It's one of the biggest ideas probably since the Internet.": 
That aside, what do you think of the content?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:09:39
Nope. I emailed hime back and didn't get a response.

I first played with this service back in March when bitcoins weren't worth nearly as much. I had a few bucks in there and it seemed like a cool idea. I keep track of my wallet balances in a spreadsheet and realized there was some real money in there now. I went to withdraw it and found, unsurprisingly, the balance was 0. I tracked down the creator of the site and emailed him about it. This is what he said:
Bitcointipper was shut down in June. As part of the shutdown process I attempted to notify the depositors and after the month long notification period all unclaimed funds were donated to the bitcoin foundation. A Ukrainian developer bought the site in September and restarted it. That's why the site is still up but it says you have a 0 balance. You can read the shutdown notice at HTTP://myearwood.com/blog  I'm sorry for the confusion caused.
Not sure how hard he tried to notify depositors, considering a single DM would have done the trick (which I never got).

I haven't tried the bitfoor method yet, but it's on my list of things to try. I've been thinking about putting together some training videos for people. My friends want me to buy some for them, but I don't fully understand the FinCEN ruling to know if that's a good idea. Always so much more to learn. :)

Glad the CEO chimed in. Seems like much less of an issue that originally reported. That won't stop the media smear campaign, though, I'm sure. Just like how cnbc thinks Bitcoin got "hacked" because mtgox dealt with a DDOS. Media, please.

Nice one, Bill. :)

I think it still has some issues. I tried playing with it tonight but I'm not sure it's actually fully set up yet. More info here:

I started a company called FoxyCart.com which integrates with Bitpay. We support 60 or so gateways, so you could accept USD along with BTC. We also do subscriptions, tax and shipping rates, etc.
Reach out if we can help. Good luck!

Which is why Bitcoin has a very long road ahead of it. If the "tech" people don't even get it yet, it will be a while before everyone else does. 2019 seems like a good year to me.
