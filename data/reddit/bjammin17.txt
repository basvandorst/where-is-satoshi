Government ID and hand scan? Fuck that. It also takes a photo of you. Fuck that. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 01:19:21
Do you have to show your ID or how much can you purchase?

cough* cult cough*

I would have to agree. That looks sketchy as hell. Are there people inside or does it just have like an atm attached to the side?
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:13:53
Where are you from?
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:04:35
This looks so promising. I mean look at the effort that went into that website.

Still take a 2.75% fee. But makes sense.

Same thing happened to me. I'm still banned from interac email transfer today. They keep saying there is a case open that there was fraudulent activity, even though I never got scammed. I was selling bitcoins through Localbitcoins over paypal(risky I know), interac and local sales. This was 8 months ago though.
I eventually gave up buying and selling personally because it has been way too big of a hassle. 
Edit: I was using TD and they definitely not for bitcoin.

Hah. That's pocket change for them.
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:32:35
hahahhaa. that was good.

6% over vault of satoshi is like at least 10% over cavirtex. Yeah right!

You must be new here...

some of these are not bad. But some off them are just awful graphic designs. I saw the bitcoin brains logo too!
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:55:12
Gave me a good laugh.

They have terrible exchange rates. There like a prepaid credit cards. Did you get it at remedy?

That was terrible. She wouldn't let him finish 80% of his sentences. Talk about jumping to conclusions before even doing your research. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:40:57
This is cool.

This is soooo stupid. This guy isn't god. We don't have to worship him.
