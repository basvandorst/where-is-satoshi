Doesn’t make it money though, money is used, this is just held in the hope it will be worth more one day and some schmuck buys it off of you
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:10:02
Give it time and it’ll happen
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:33:32

This won’t age well...
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:03:43
Fuck the price, get people to use it
@_date: 2018-09-25 09:53:54
Yeah cause the price is all that matters, not adoption, not putting the banks out of play, just the price.../s
@_date: 2018-09-17 11:18:10
No we don’t 
@_date: 2018-09-25 14:18:46
True, but lets actually do it that way, I’m sick and tired of all the shitposts about pricegains because of some bs charts or cryptoexpert saying it will go so and so high
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:01:30

Do your own research
@_date: 2018-08-06 10:44:22
Bit late eh
@_date: 2019-11-05 17:55:37
Dont want to knock you down but crypto doesnt really need a “the onion” since most of crypto literally is “the onion”
Good luck tho
@_date: 2019-11-05 01:13:11
On a serious note, dont flaunt your cryptoholdings like this, i’ve seen people do horrible stuff to others for far less.

Don’t share your shit like this, idiot
@_date: 2019-10-22 15:39:10
Retarded posts like this want to make me leave this sub
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:51:06

Glad to see some positive news about bitcoin but are we really going to suck off the dude running a highly censored social media platform?
@_date: 2019-06-17 09:15:54
Sending everything I got right now
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:43:31
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:04:16
Is anyone even busy with adoption/development or is it just pricetalk only now? :/
@_date: 2019-02-06 12:49:05
They’ll keep trying till it actually bottoms, so they can say they “called it”
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:36:07
Spend and rebuy idiot, you want this to be a currency or what
@_date: 2019-04-22 10:08:00

@_date: 2018-03-20 03:19:25
This needs more upvotes 
@_date: 2019-01-25 09:32:45
Exactly, no offense to op but I’ve seen enough plugins causing harm to be installing anything anymore

@_date: 2018-07-18 16:42:30
Not more than half of what you think you can lose
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:40:23
Probably a matter of time before he fakes his own death to get out of his bet
@_date: 2019-09-16 13:41:31
I’m sorry mate you have to get back in line, my crowdfunding for a sex change is happening first
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:20:42
Why are there still people trading on hitbtc, seriously, why? How many examples do people need to see it’s a shitty exchange which can’t be trusted with your crypto
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:19:59
Be careful with that mate, better safe than sorry.
I’d suggest an exchange
