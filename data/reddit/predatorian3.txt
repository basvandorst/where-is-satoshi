I want to full heartedly believe you in your statements, but do we have proof or thought through these possibilities yet? I haven't searched for any studies or conversations about the topic yet. I understand the private key thing, but I'm not sure it follows the same idea in that I can revoke my previous key and get a new one and move on with my life. 
I do need a way to store the inevitable Bitcoin I'm going to get. I'll research that more though.

I'm just learning the ideas about and behind Bitcoin and it's derivatives. I can't contribute code back or make big changes myself, but I enjoy the philosophy of Bitcoin and the Block chain in that there was some form of non-repudiation, and I can tell where and what my money is going to without some trust based system possibly dissolving my money or not using what I have appropriately. That is what gives it value to me. 
For a while I wrestled with the thought of what really gives physical paper money value and why I would have to respect it as a thought experiment. I'm no college educated person and only can make speculation, but it seemed to me tell he original value was from some shiny rock someone wanted and then someone else wanted it. 
I am following Bitcoin and the Block chain for different reasons than just how much it has grown in our current currency value. I hope more places allow the use of Bitcoin and it's derivatives.

This is definitely an eye opener, and learning read for me, I enjoyed it. Like he says its horribly inefficient.

Links for the lazy? I'll look into the Andreas Antonopoulos videos.
