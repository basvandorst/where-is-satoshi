This is not Tradefortress himself. The old Tradefortress was capable of writing posts with grammar, punctuation and thought. This  new one writes trolly one liners in lowercase.

I withdrew a larger Balance than you , last sunday alone. So far they have been really reliable. It really has to be an issue with your Bank and not kraken.

I'm in London next Week , is it possible to buy a bottle of your gin with Bitcoin in person?

You accusing him of misusing millions of donated funds is so wrong. Check your facts ... What most people seem to completely overlook is that most of the money came from ads when bitcoin was not worth as much. So most of it is basically income from the site which could have easily gone into the pockets of its owners. But it didn't. So now some totally unrelated guys show up , which probably have not even donated and demand accountability. Kinda weird, if you ask me.
Here i found some of them :  &amp;  There are a lots of these weekly auctions...

Then why bother to reply?

With overclocking you will reach 250Mh and that will net you approximately 3 bitcoins per month if used 24/7. Keep in mind that difficulty rises and that you have to Pay electricity.

I would be interested in an open source version.
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:54:49
me personally im more interested in how you did it, i wouldn't need more indicators right now.

Hey guys, found the idiot!

Yes, everyday while i collect my 600€ from george soros in the street where all migrants have a government given Rolex.

This is utter nonsense. The auction lasts until tomorrow and without Money from The auction their is no increase in dividends.

The High is attributed to this :

Well if they start accepting bitcoin , one could try and start a full autonomous (trading) bot.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:15:03
Well , i am sorry for your loss.

Asicminer starts deploying again soon , nothing to worry about :-p
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:55:02
No, please get someone who speaks german when dealing with customers. Especially German customers are a picky kind.

Time for "I held on 04/11/2013" - T-Shirts?

Hey Matthew , how is the pirate betting business going ?
@_date: 2013-04-06 13:40:38
Just because we deal in Bitcoins does not mean we are there to fund everything. So many people are trying this and i do not get it.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:03:49
Yes, this is expected and there are more auctions to come. Additionally asicminer will Start deploying additional hashingpower from April 22th. How much will be Sold and how much will be mined with is yet to determine. We are speaking of 50 TH total. Another 200 TH are already paid for and to be expected in june. Please don't make assumptions if you do not have Information.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:15:33
This is only shitty, if you have no asicminer shares and have a preorder. Friedcat knows what he is doing, no 51 % imminent.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:08:45
Well ... 
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:52:50
This sounds odd to me  : Es gibt keine Limitierungen auf Wert, Anzahl oder Destination der Bestellung
Better : Es gibt keine Limitierungen von Wert, Anzahl oder Destination der Bestellung
But it is debatable.

Is there any alternative on par with the silkroad mixer which is not coinjoin ?
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:15:55
There is no logic within expecting increased dividends coming the same day a 3 Day auction started.
