Here's what I can do with WU: I can take in a handful of fiat. I can give it to the clerk, and the clerk digitally credits the recipient for that amount. The recipient goes to their clerk, who then gives them an equal amount of fiat, which they can then immediately spend at a restaurant, a grocer, a fuel station, a hotel, or a department store, or use it to pay rent.
This exchange can happen instantly, and there is no waiting for confirmations. There is no need to send in copies of either of our bank statements, proof of address, social security cards, etc. There is no ACH delay while waiting to convert from analog to digital to analog. The received fiat can be spent immediately at nearly all retail establishments.
The only negative WU has over BTC is a fee, which is kinda necessary. People don't work for free, and telecommunications infrastructure and equipment don't magically appear on your lawn. One day, BTC can get to a point where it can be better than WU in the above mentioned regards, but today is not that day.

Could be worse. Capital One 360, formerly ING Direct, allows only digits for online banking passwords. How's that for one-factor authentication?

It'll get no interest. There's nothing on the decal with information about bitcoin, nor anything that can be used to search about bitcoin.

Could you tell me which banks lost all of their customers' deposits (not investments), and those deposits were not insured?

Running a successful business would have him only a few million. Another spike like last year would make the 700k coins he likely stole worth a billion USD.

How exactly do you buy something without meeting someone face to face... without a bank account? Prepaid debit card? Bank account. Credit card? Bank account. ACH/Swift? Bank account. Technically, even a money order is a temporary bank account, that the bank can refuse to honor if they don't like the recipient.

I suggest something like a lock cable, or relatively similar, so it looks more official and done with permission. While you and I know there's permission and it's legitimate, the tens of thousands or even millions that will pass it will not.

I think you're mixing up deposit accounts and loan and investment accounts. I don't recall anything about the deposit accounts at those banks being at risk. This is because the deposit accounts, for the most part, were covered by insurance. This insurance was paid for by the financial institutions, not by requirement, but by choice.

This is more of a vending machine than ATM.

Is it an ATM or just a vending machine?

How many normal banks have lost/stolen all of their deposits? How many normal banks do not have deposits insured? On average, a depositor can walk into BoA, PNC, BDO Unibank, UBS, etc, and withdraw what they've deposited. I can't even walk into Gox, Coinbase, Bitinstant, Center, etc, let alone make a withdrawal at all from Gox or Bitinstant.

What kind of fee would you consider acceptable that would cover all of the following:
* Hiring developers
* R&amp;D
* Legal staff
* Material needs (servers, office equipment, etc)
* Redundant infrastructure
* Employee pay
* Insurance for fraud (you can't exactly call up Bitcoin and issue a chargeback when someone sends you a brick in an iPhone box)
* Insurance for disaster to equipment and office
* Insurance for employees
* Health care for employees
* Rental or purchase of office space
* HR to screen employees to make sure they aren't going to steal your money
* Utilities for the office, so employees can use the restroom, consume water, and have heat and light

Yes, but I have no choice in the matter. However, I avoid generally crowded areas, where I can contract or spread illness to others. I am aware that I am a burden on society, and do what I can to lessen that burden. Anti-vaccers, on the other hand, are willfully introducing harm on people.

If someone works as a truck driver, and refuses to take seizure medicine on principle, and they then plow their explosive tanker into a skyscraper/stadium/school/hospital as a result, is it then ok, because they were misinformed? I mean, they didn't mean to kill those people, so it's ok, right?

What does this have to do with bitcoin? There are well known and clearly adopted procedures across the industry regarding the sale of prepaid and gift cards, which you explicitly refuse to implement. You refuse cash-only. You didn't even check your security footage ("it would probably have been erased"). This thread is littered with people offering helpful ideas, and your only movement has been refusal to do anything to protect yourself. This has nothing to do with bitcoin, and everything to do with poor store management decisions.

Why would you consider his opinion on what would attract new clients? He's an engineer already sold. That's like asking RMS what he thinks about paying for software. You advertise to people who have no idea what it is, because, really, that's an overwhelming majority of humanity. You don't advertise to its core group. What would you use to sell something called a (bit)coin to people who have never played the game before?

Food poisoning? Likely, but I have not seen any historical documents to support that claim. Intentional misrepresentation about quality and safety? Yeah. That kinda was the inspiration for it. Grab yourself a copy of The Jungle.


Yes, yes they were. Some still are, such as coal mines, and very recently, a particular tuna canning company.


Do you really think slavery, indentured servitude, and company stores are just lore? Or that union workers getting shot at the Homestead Strike was just a myth?


Nope, but I know they make it harder for such things to occur.


Not at all.
Now, do I think the government is flawless? Hell no. It's extremely bloated, abusive, and goes well beyond what it should be doing, serving its people. It can do that with less than 1% of what it is currently. But the world wasn't roses and sunshine before these things were implemented. They were created specifically because of the abuses of some corporations. Nothing is pure good, nor pure evil.

I know, right. It's uncivilized that I should have to pay for your military and police protection, your rescue services, the inspection of your meats (FDA), dairy (FDA), and medication (DEA), that your workplace is safe (OSHA) and that your employer is paying wages properly (DOL), that your vehicle will not explode upon start (NTSB), that your electronics will not emit radiation that will harm you (FCC), etc. "Screw you, I got mine."
