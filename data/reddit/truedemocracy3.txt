sorry, but that's not happening. Nothing backs bitcoin. There is nothing you can buy with Bitcoin that you cant with better currencies (that isnt drugs or other similar shit).

Yea I'll take that bet. You do realize that Bitcoins success as a currency in terms of adoption and what makes it a good short term investment can't coexist right? You realize that LESS western e-commerce companies accept bitcoin this year than in 2016, right?
Any currency that can double or triple this fast in value will not be accepted as a currency. Making Bitcoin inherently worthless.

When you have to break a currency down to fractions and it still is an absurd amount then it isnt a real currency

If you think it's priced in at 1% adoption you are highly mistaken. It is pure speculation right now and has been for a while. This isnt Wall Street or savvy investors driving the price up. It's a bunch of people not wanting to miss out on the craze, primarily kids in parts of Asia.
Will it stabilize and be useful? Sure, I wouldnt bet against it. Just like after the dot com crash there was still immense value in similar technology (e-commerce, apps, etc.). But considering adoption of bitcoin is actually DECREASING in its biggest market and price continues to skyrocket they sadly are not connected, for now. If bitcoin is widely accepted it will be after the bubble burst.

It's a chicken and the egg. No one is going to accept it as a currency until it stabilizes. It wont stabilize until it's adopted as a currency.
It's a great technology that is now drawing in a ton of suckers. Hope you got in early. Dont get in now.
