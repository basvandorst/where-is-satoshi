I was going to buy, didn't, and the price dropped. I plan on buying tomorrow, I think the timing will be good.

So finding an old hard drive and searching "bitcoins" on the disk, could potentially yield a gold mine?

My Radeon 5830 is no good, I take it?

No, they're like that, all unique. Lastpass has password generator built in. RTFM, lastpass.com
@_date: 2012-08-17 15:00:10
Thanks, I'll give it a shot.
@_date: 2012-08-16 19:47:01
That's significantly different from dropping.
@_date: 2012-08-19 04:50:32
Yeah, imagine $600 in video card(s) instead...
@_date: 2012-08-17 14:48:46
Can you, or anyone else for that matter, recommend a client?
@_date: 2012-08-09 14:39:53
Hyper inflation's always fun.
@_date: 2012-08-09 17:34:09
It will be great when there's bitcoin debit cards. Or course, the market will have to settle down first. Businesses take enough risk with the volatile nature of their goods (Gasoline is a good example). I doubt they'd take risk in bitcoins where $100 can be worth $50 tomorrow.
@_date: 2012-08-13 18:30:51
I'm sure some people would want to do that but it seems like a massive undertaking.

Read it as, "Thanks Adderall".

I have, but really, break even at all current numbers, with the exception of a 25 coin reward shows 2-3 weeks. You really think it's going to halve again in that time?
@_date: 2012-08-29 19:06:14
The scan would be completely different. With encryption if 1 bit is off it's a no-go.
@_date: 2012-08-19 21:53:54
Yes. To show that numerical value != purchasing power.
@_date: 2012-08-19 05:00:27
You do realize they are both currencies with purchasing power? 1 bitcoin now may not be worth the same as 1 bitcoin in the future. The Zimbabwean dollar is an extreme example. You can't simply say BTC are BTC and because they are cheaper they aren't less powerful. They are absolutely less powerful if they are cheaper.

Otherwise you'd just be DDoS'ing tor.
@_date: 2012-09-17 02:53:06
You can make a request. Maybe someone's willing to sell near you.
@_date: 2012-09-21 03:27:15
@_date: 2012-09-30 16:53:17
Break even before rewards go down, then mine until electricity costs more than what your making, then toss the damn box.

No need to create an account, just set your wallet address as your username.

I've heard Jim Cramer give the same exact advice with stocks.
@_date: 2012-10-03 01:16:38
Interesting, but why would a bubble be building based on hardware? Wouldn't a huge supply be anticipated?
@_date: 2012-08-20 06:24:14
I want to see more of the physical bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-08-09 06:09:05
Fuck, I'm thinking of selling all my copper and buying bitcoins. I mean, copper's optimistic on the housing market, but bitcoins, that is a pessimistic investment.
@_date: 2012-08-17 14:57:34
I've done folding before (F so I'm familiar with the hardware side of it, I was just wondering about the financial part of it.
@_date: 2012-12-17 22:51:21
Why wouldn't a website have it renewed months in advance? Also, WTF does a certificate do that makes it safer?
@_date: 2012-08-18 07:16:20
Do you recommend that pool? I've been using Eligius.
@_date: 2012-08-17 17:31:00
If I had the $600 to spend I might buy it. Hopefully it will drop in price. Unfortunately I think mining rewards are dropping quicker than hardware prices.

It's as secure as you make your master password. Yes, it should be long, yes, it should be random characters, but you'll learn quick. My SR password is pretty much this,     "b!4mNZ3v?
It's never going to brute forced. My master pass is somewhat more memorable, though.
@_date: 2012-08-19 04:52:32
And Zimbabwean dollars are still Zimbabwean dollars.
@_date: 2012-08-20 17:03:57
Anyone else want to see his plan completely backfire?
@_date: 2012-08-29 18:35:37
Madoff got attention. Anything involving large sums of cash is newsworthy, simply due to the economic relevance.
@_date: 2012-08-29 19:03:37
@_date: 2012-08-26 06:08:17
I'm a fan of just mining namecoins and selling them. Or holding them and hoping they appreciate :D
@_date: 2012-08-17 16:38:55
120 days = 4 months, maybe just enough time to pay off the investment before rewards halve?
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:28:23
I bet you SEC got them. It's a bitch doing business in the US.
