It need not be a negative experience. For the cost of $1,000, you've learned what it is like to make a collaborative decision where there's give and take on both sides. That's something that is worth more than $1,000. Plus it may go back up.

Um... you can't have it both ways. You want bitcoin to be generally accepted so that it's value becomes solidified and more universally accepted.
But on the other hand you don't like it when people complain about how the transaction fees are justifiable.
Either Bitcoin is to remain some kind of darknet fetish investment where only the deeply committed can accept the inconvenience that comes with it, or it has to be user-friendly enough for general population to use or care about.
Seems like you want people to generally accept bitcoin without expecting them to want basic functionalities.

Um... I'm just someone who drops in once in a while to see what's up with Bitcoin. I'm not a shill and these fee questions seem really legitimate.
In fact, it is the Bitcoin supporters who shout "HOLD" for everything who seem like delusional people.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:59:15
But that's a great thing right? We should be supporters of not any one currency. We should be supporters of the idea of a free currency, and more competition is good for improvement.

I don't know anything technical about Bitcoin, so here's my stupid question: Why don't you guys just standardize the cost of using Bitcoins and put the fee as part of the value.
So for example, say right now a unit of Bitcoin is $100, and the cost of using that unit is $20. Then why not just say the value of a unit of Bitcoin is $80?

That's my strategy when waiting for favorite shows on hiatus.

That's like saying I need to follow the Feds and Ron Paul's twitter feed in order to use my dollar bill at the 7-11.

Is there a pretty solid place that consolidates the prices from different exchanges and show it as one price? 
Or are the prices at major exchanges so close that it doesn't make a difference to regular people.
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:03:37
Ah I see. So if you didn't have to wait, when do you think is best time to invest between now and the actual ETF decision?
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:39:56
Nice! Good to see long term investors gives me more confidence!

That sounds good good advice. Do you have recommendation for services/vendors who do this for you? Or will Coinbase recommend one?


Coinbase offers a regular "consumer account for everyone" that has basic buy and sell options. Is that enough? Or do I want to get the fancy "pro: advanced currency trading" option? I don't intend to day trade, just hold for maybe 6 month a few years...


Wow now you're scaring me ha ha. Is it tough to sell via Coinbase when bit drops happen? Is it like It's a Wonderful Life kind of deal where Coinbase accidentally "slows down" trade to let their bigger investors have an edge?
Thank you so much!

Newbie here. Thinking of picking up about $1-3k of Bitcoin. Not interested in watching it daily for ups and downs, but just want to hold and check in every 6 months. 
This seems like a good time to buy, since I suspect some people may have bought thinking the ETF decision was coming this Friday. Two questions:
1. How long to wait until we've hit as low as possible? End of day? 1-2 days? 3-5 days?
2. What's a good "set it and forget it" option? Do I just signup for coinbase, give them my credit card (or is it only bank account # allowed now?) and get a basic buyers account?

Why the fuck am I wasting time on Reddit....
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:01:56
Is there a explain to me like I'm 3 version. I know ATH stands for all time high (for life of bitcoin or for this month?) Sorry I'm new not only to bitcoin but investment in general.
@_date: 2018-08-10 00:56:35
You're right. He should've bought 10.
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:36:44
And Bitcoin doesn't support oppressive regimes.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:31:38
Just out of curiosity, did the price of bitcoin go up when SEC announced they were considering this application? If so, what day was it on the chart?
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:32:29
HOw does the extra month help? For example, why would you not buy today or tomorrow? Is it because you use dollar cost averaging? (Newbie quesiotns). 
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:59:13
So will bitcoin always have a small bump in the mornings when we all buy our coffee?

If you enjoyed learning something interesting and met some cool people here it's not too bad. One could find worse ways to spend one's time.

Whoa settle down there Mr. Money Bags.

Wouldn't the smart people start getting their money out NOW instead of the 1/3, like OP says? That sounds pretty rational.
