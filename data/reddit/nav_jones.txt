Well if you sold, that was a tax event. If it was high enough, it would have triggered at 1099k from Coinbase. (i think there are levels at which they automatically send them to you, lower than that, its on you)
If you sold for USD, its a tax event for whatever profit or loss you had. It doesn't make a difference if you bought back in. 
Edit: When you sold, if your BTC was worth more than it was when you bought it, thats what you are expected to pay on. If you are 'down .25', then you are able to take a $3000 loss on that move. Without knowing more about your situation, its hard to say.

Its not classified 'currency' by the IRS. also, by their use case of the blockchain, many alts aren't intended as 'currency'. yes technically you could use them as currency but in the same sense i could use socks as currency... they aren't charging me for cash advances when i buy socks

some of these articles are including Citi in the ban but citi is still discussing it, clockbaity/poor journalism 
i’m guessing citi will end up banning it too, let’s not pretend any of these mega banks are in competition with each other, but Citi not banning would be awesome as they will be the only main player that allows it (haven’t heard anything about amex). it’s not like citi would be raking in the cash from it, but these banks let you run up your credit on anything so the idea of them having too much risk in crypto dropping in value is nonsense, i could go out right now and max out on cigarettes and alcohol if i wanted, nothing left to repo. i could see the case for fraud but the protections have gotten so good that you frequently trigger fraud protection if you make purchase outside of your normal living area... new limits/classes for crypto purchases could mitigate that, but it isn’t gonna happen. i’m not totally familiar with the reasons behind not being able to buy traditional stocks on credit cards but i believe it’s the brokers that restrict it because of chargebacks and what not, not the credit issuers themselves(could be inaccurate, i only briefly read about it the other day )

its hard to say considering the wording on the site that its just 20k?

why? whats the big deal? so what you pay a little interest, it makes the world go around. are you never gonna finance a car either or buy a house? because you have to pay interest?

Will Coinbase send me a 1099 or similar form?
For U.S. users only, Coinbase provides Forms 1099-K to certain business users and GDAX users that have received at least $20,000 cash for sales of cryptocurrency related to at least 200 transactions in a calendar year.
Seems like it has to be related to 200 transactions for it to come directly from CB. Otherwise you are on your own to report.

i believe that the brokers restricting it is the main reason behind that, to avoid chargebacks 
they don’t want me buying speculative assets but i can buy cigarettes, alcohol, or anything else that is consumed and leaves nothing of value behind... so not nreally buying the whole “what if it goes down” thing

yeah but you are free to run up as much credit card debt with buying anything else that leaves no repossesble object ... go ahead and max out your credit card on beer and food
this is obviously a barrier to make entry harder, has nothing to do with stolen cards or the fact bitcoin might drop in price

Just curious, how did you receive the 1099? The mail? Email? From your coinbase account? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:24:01
So the OP must have made 200 transactions in the year. From buying crypto over the year, transferring or whatever. He mentions 'made some buys and sells in decemeber"... There must be more to it on his end or something more is going on on the coinbase end.

according to the site:
(more than 200 receipt transactions which amount to greater than $20,000 during the calendar year)
it seems it has to be more than 200 trans which amount to greater than 20k. not just 20k

the story of the Tether MC has been told 5-6 times a week in blogs/articles, for the past month, why is it still being rehashed ... just to maintain the FUD campaign most likely 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:56:23
crypto currency has really opened my eyes to the amazing number of total shit fuck blogs that are disguised as news sites 
oh and the rehashed clickbait headlines and shitty ads

why? 
If interest is something you're worried about... There are 0% interest rates for months on some new cards. Or most cards you can pay off your balance at the end of your statement term and pay no interest. 
CC purchases are instant on Coinbase and the limits on a CC are much higher than the daily limits that most debit cards have. Bank transfers can take a week. 
if you are trading, its totally worth it to buy on a CC... well, it was until this cash advance thing
