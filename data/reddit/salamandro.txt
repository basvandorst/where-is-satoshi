What if you had bought a more stable currency like Swiss Francs?
Or stocks of any kind?

I'm good, thanks. And thanks for the upvote. Though no one else seems to care :D

No. It is the line required to get to $1'000'000.00 by 12-31-2020. Or to quote your source:




See that?


Big **if** right there.


So what you are saying is you're looking at a 10 year old human who's 4 feet tall and tell me he's going to continue growing until he's 10 feet tall and his brain fails due to low blood pressure?

No, it just isn't. The red line and your graph are taken from  The red line is based on a tweet by John McAfee who famously wrote on July 17th 2017: One single Bitcoin would be worth $ 500,000.00 in three years. The closing price according to CoinDesk was $ 2,244.27 that day. If not, he would eat his own dick on national television. That is the starting point of the red line in your graph.
The end point is on $ 1,000,000.00 on 2020-12-31, as he revised his bet and predicted $ 1 million by the end of 2020.
The red line is **NOT** based on any data. It is nothing more than the line necessary in order to reach from $ 2,244.27 on 2017-07-17 to 1,000,000.00 on 2020-12-31.  *Nothing more, and nothing less*.
If you actually take the available data and plot an exponential trend line it will land short of $100k:  Though this highly varies on where you actually set your starting point. From 2009 on it would land beyond $100k:  And if you start late 2017, it will actually end up in de lower $100s: 


As it stands, there is **NO** way of telling how tall a 10-year old will grow. He might get stuck at 14-years or he might get another huge boost at 17-years. There are formulas factoring in the father's and the mother's height, but that's about it. Now for crypto-currencies, there just isn't a whole lot of reliable data to go on with, most of it speculation. But if you just take the kids growth from 0 to 10 years and exponentially trend it to go on for another 60 years, you're not very smart. The real question (that no one can answer yet) is: Is bitcoin 10 years old (compared to a human) and still has a whole lot of potential growth, or has it already reached it's maturity and will either stay that way or even begin to shrink.


At least on this we agree :)

A few things, some have been mentioned before:
1) The red line is not a *trend* line based on any actual data. It is the line that the bitcoin price has to follow in order to meet John McAfee's prediction of "Bitcoin price = $1mm by the end of 2020"
2) I'd argue it is a lot tougher to get to $1,000,000 from $100,000 than it is to $100,000 from $10'000 or even to 10'000 from 1'000 (which, at this time, has only been achieved for a couple of weeks)
3) It took 2 years to get to $1. It took another 2 years to get to $100. A whooping 4 years to break $1000 permanently. Then the world got crazy for a bit in 2017, but prices have yet to reach a level where they stay above $10,000
4) Right now ($7,483.48) Bitcoin is 42.95% below the "prediction". And it's only gonna get tougher.
