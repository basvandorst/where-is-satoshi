You're obviously *something*.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:39:15
You started it.  Can you not back up your claim?
@_date: 2016-08-15 02:36:30
Not sure what you're getting at. Skin color has nothing to do with one's humanity.  It's what is in their heart. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:02:40
Prove it.

Because one of his parents are black.  Not sure what that has to do with God....

SMH.  You got me.  You're so clever.  All hail the Clever Teenage Atheist.  You should put that talent to good use.  Terrible shame it's wasted on Reddit, where people won't understand or appreciate your cleverness.  [Keep it up.](

That explains it.


Well, that's a good thing.  Wait.  Look at this:


The new testament was written about 2000 years ago, and many historians consider the author of Luke and Acts to be an excellent historian.
And how do you come up with the entire Bible being fiction?  Have you read it, or are you simply and unintelligently swayed by silly atheist propaganda?  It would be a shame to be a proponent of intelligence and dismiss one of the best ways to discover true wisdom.

You made the claim.  Back it up.

I wouldn't be so opposed to paying taxes if half the budget wasn't about war aggression.  Calling it "defense" is akin to North Korean propoganda.

I'm just a casual observer in a small-time investor, but I would say yes. It's only going to go back up from where the lowest point reaches, currently. I'm not worried. I bought $600 when it was over $17,000 USD.  It'll go back up.

It's cash deposits.  I can deposit a $20 million check, and the bank is not obligated to report.
Also, if the bank suspects someone is structuring cash deposits to avoid the $10,000 (**in a single transaction**) reporting requirement, the bank must report that, as well.
I'm a former bank teller.  We were trained annually on this, and I have had to fill our a few SAR's in my tenure.  Used car salesman came in once with $10,100 in cash.  Told him we have to fill out the form.  He asked if he could deposit half today and half tomorrow.  Told him if he did, we would report it.  As long as there is a legit reason for someone to have that kind of cash (casino winnings, private transaction), there's nothing to fear.

"Thanks for the hug. Since most people don't understand me, I get called all kinds of names and treated like property.  But with a little open-mindedness, people will see how much better i will make life. Won't it be nice to have control over your money, and not have to follow the ways of the corrupt current system?"

There's a little more to getting product to your door that just downloading Tor.  If you give two shits about OPSEC, you have to do your research.  Sure, you can *get onto* a DNM in a few minutes, and get your stuff, but you might as well spend the time learning how to avoid scammers, phishing, FE losses, bad products,  shifty vendors, CD' s, LEO interactions and self-incrimination, and anything else you should know before  ordering, so you don't end up someone's bitch in the state penn.

But then we get to the middleman controlling all the money.

  Was it deliberate?  Because if I got out of here, I wouldn't tell anyone what goes on in here.  I would be just as indictable as you for laundering that money.....

I need this job to help me to claim my father's millions of dollars in his funeral trust.  Just an small advance on my paycheck is all I require to start our business.  You need to agree tomorrow and go to Western Union to forward my first paycheck, to get this start tomorrow.
