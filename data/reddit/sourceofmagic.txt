Looks like it's a different bot?

Why does it require a login?   That is an immediate no for me.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:02:37
But those features are not immediately required.   I can read reddit, browse imgur, etc... without logging in.   And when I need to do certain features that require a login THEN I have to login.  
I would never access a site that requires a login just to browse.   Hell, even coinbase I can browse the current charts without logging in.

I don't believe any one country can kill bitcoin, even one as large as India.

This reply has been spot on...tanked close to 2000 on most exchanges and has been hovering at 2100-2200-2300 range on most

I only used coinbase because I was both Circle and coinbase verified from last year.    Since circle quit doing Bitcoin I had searched for other exchanges.    I signed up for Kraken last month and just got verified yesterday.    I signed up for Gemini last monday and get verified today.    Bought a small amount of BTC on Gemini to test the waters there at around 2600.    Went smoothly.

Can somebody ELI5 if I have a local wallet?
My understanding if I have my bitcoin under my control today (i.e. I have the keys and use a local wallet) that when or if a split happens, my current coins are valid on both chains, correct?    
When I decide to make a transaction, the type of wallet I use will determine on which chain path my bitcoin goes down.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:36:48
This is valid but there is also the possibility that they do not have enough bitcoin on hand to process all of the sale orders which would make having the site inaccessible during peak sale times to be convenient for them.

History has shown plenty of corporations doing either stupid stuff or shady stuff.  e.g Enron
You would be amazed at what goes on the inner workings of many corporation.

I'm glad people think this way since it will drive the price down for cheap.   Buying bitcoin pre-fork allows you to have bitcoin on both forks and you can wait and see and pick the winning fork.

My guess is anytime there is negative us government news, weak hands fold.    
I'm HODLing.
