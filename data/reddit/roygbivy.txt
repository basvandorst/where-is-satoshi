It is sort of ironic and a paradox that bitcoin can be used to pay for stuff but its USD value can go up 50% or 50% down in a matter of months. I like the utility of bitcoin but I am premising that on it keep risong in price so I would only have "shave" smaller and smaller pieces of my coin holdings to pay for stuff.
