[Bitcoin users message to the BU ...](

I noticed that too. They come from:
1) The China FUD bitcoin price "crash" and quick recovery.
2) This r/bitcoin CIA Wikileaks [post](  reached front page of Reddit (with around 5000 points right now).
I'm curious, did we break the record for more 'users here now' ever? I don't remember seeing more than 5000 in the last few years.

Great boost towards bitcoin mainstream adoption.

And just like with Brexit and Trump, the bets are switching to "win" in the last minutes.

This is a great chance to educate some gold bugs by clarifying some misinformed commenters in that video. I was already subscribed to Bix, smart guy.

Wow! this is the first time I see mostly positive comments towards bitcoin on a ZeroHedge article. Maybe because it was well written and detailed.

Physical delivery of BTC?

Congrats! Just in time for the moon ride.
My jaw dropped with this:

You are wrong. Quantum computing is no threat to Bitcoin, that has been debunked many times. When they become available (in a few decades) open source bitcoin will have adjusted its protocol long in advance. Bitcoin is antifragile, the more is attacked, the stronger it gets. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.). While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography.
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.

$1100. Still close to all-time high. No big deal.

Better help to educate people on Bitcoin posts outside r/bitcoin where trolls are spreading misinformation:
