I'm fucking doing this. But better. I'm good at arts and crafts, it's just not my *job*. o_o GOLD
"It's called "Wee too", which has a double-meaning. Not only is it another interpretation of the now famous original painting, hence the second coin also going "wee" , but it's also a play on the computer jargon "V2", or 'version two', which is commonly used whenever a program is upgraded"

Seems to me that... *munches chips on sofa* ....since this is a new age, you could think of almost any solution to this problem. For instance, you could have 2 different coins 'tied' to the same cryptocurrency 'brand'.
So imagine "BitDollar', a new coin which has new features. There's the traditional 'crypto currency' feature where it acts basically like an investment/stock, with all its ups and downs.
And then you have the 'actually use this as a currency' coin, called 'BitCent' which has a nice little calculation to it which basically means if you buy $1 worth of BitCent today, even with a *mad rush* to buy BitDollar, there's this calculation that means it has a certain exchange ratio tied to the BitDollar at all times.
With a mad rush for BitDollar, increasing the 'traditional crypto currency' price by 10x over a few months, you'll just see this calculation do its thing and basically increase BitCent in value in much the same rate as fiat currency, *based* on what BitDollar does. It effectively takes the graph over BitDollar and shrinks it vertically.
And that way you could have both.
