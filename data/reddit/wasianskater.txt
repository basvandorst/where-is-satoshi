Well stocks are definitely expensive when you look at most valuation metrics, but they also could keep running for a while. Nobody knows. Also the stock market doesn't necessarily have to drop in value for valuation metrics to catch up. The reason you would want stocks, crypto, REITs, bonds, etc is because they all offer some rate of return which is not necessarily correlated with each other. You can minimize the risk (measured by standard deviation of returns) in a portfolio by investing across many asset classes, without really affecting expected return. The trick to investing isn't just to get the best return possible (like crypto this year), but rather to get the best risk adjusted return. If your wife is more risk averse, you would want to weight your portfolio heavier in bonds, then stocks, then a tiny portion in crypto. And when I say stocks/bonds, I'm talking about total market index funds which hold basically every security in their respective market. Don't try to pick winners, way too risky. 
Hope this helps!

Hello! I am a registered investment advisor. First of all as much as I love crypto, she should absolutely not put her entire savings into Bitcoin. Depending on her risk tolerance, she should allocate a certain percentage to a diversified crypto portfolio, as well as stocks.. maybe even some bonds/REITs. If you want I could help you guys draw up a suitable portfolio.

They decrease available supply on the market. So frozen wallets should make the prices go up.

As with all investments, there is no guarantee that the price will go up. Bitcoin is a very risky investment (risk=variance of returns). Imo Bitcoin price will go up over the next few years or so. Especially if the scaling issue is resolved soon. If you're looking to invest in crypto, I would highly recommend creating a market weighted portfolio of all of the other cryptos. The other ones show just as much, if not more potential than Bitcoin. By holding many different coins, you can diversify away unsystemic risk without affecting expected returns
