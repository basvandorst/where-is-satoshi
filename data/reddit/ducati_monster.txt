It’s funny I had(still have) something similar from the early 90s made by Realistic, a radio shack company, that was a box with a spinning arm with green and red LEDs that flashed to music via a built in mic, creating a digital kaleidoscope. It’s probably my favorite thing I ever owned but unfortunately it doesn’t work any more.

Coinbase is FDIC, very safe to buy bitcoin thru it. You don’t pay taxes on bitcoin unless you withdrawal to your bank acct, and you most likely made money so you have to file what you spent and what you earned.

I think it’s more to spread awareness in the coolest way possible and have the option to buy BTC
