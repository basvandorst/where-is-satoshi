You seem to misunderstand investing son. You get returns on your investment because there is a chance it will fail. Asking how you get your money back from a failed investment is like asking the shopkeeper for your money back when your lottery pick doesnt win.

Just withdrawn 8 btc from LB with no issues so dont panic. The localbitcoin team are some of the best, even if there has been a few btc stolen (which isnt even confirmed) they have been quick to react to the problem and i assume correct it. Screw Mycelium local trader!

Since this is a venture by Neo &amp; Bee id suggest investing in them. 
Visit havelock or the direct purchase of shares is available through the investor relations website.
