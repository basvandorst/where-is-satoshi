So before the 10% discount, that means it was originally 222% overpriced.  
Or if it was originally 200% overpriced, you mean that it is now only 170% overpriced.  
(Sorry, studying for the GRE.)

You're compartmentalizing the expense, in a way.  Yes, you still have to deal with charge backs for the segment of your business on plastic.  However, you might save money if some percentage of your business is protected against charge backs, and you can pass on some of those savings to those customers.  In the least, what you're saying is that if the customer guarantees that there won't be a charge back, you're willing to give them a small discount.

Right?  You might find the $65M hard drive and never even realize it.  It would be a maddening task.  (Though probably worth it, tbh.)

Think about how many severely damaged hard drives you would find.  You'd need someone dedicated to the task of working on the drives while someone else did the searching (at a minimum) if there would ever be any hope.  Think about it:  Not only would there be lots of drives that were wrecked by the elements, but when hard drives crash, people often simply throw them away, so you'd be dealing with lots of drives that were crashed even *before* winding up in the land fill.  It would help immensely to know at least the brand of HD you're looking for, because you could easily spend an 8-hour work day just trying to fix one or two drives.
