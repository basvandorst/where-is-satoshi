And the scene is from "One flew over the cuckkoos nest". Great movie!
Fitting meme... phew

Maybe you should look at yourself before accusing the whole community? 
Nearly everyone on this site holds bitcoin and tells you to get some, for years. It is always pro bitcoin and everyone is bullish af. Of course there are some "sane" people who warn at clear highs (or at any price), but nobody really knows where it is going. Plus you have some people talking their books when shorting or pumping alts or something. 
Maybe you had doubts and suffered from confirmation bias. You always find enough people who tell you to stay away.

lol, at least it is private television...
you have a video link? I'm interested in what that lady has to tell me.

I think the whitepaper deserves some visibility and should be read by every owner or potential buyer. You can skip the too technical stuff; most of it is very understandable for the common reader.

But it would basically be robbery and could be proven by someone holding keys to a wallet X years ago (whatever number will be chosen to start the confiscation at). Forcing everyone to move their coins would not work I guess. 
Why would people want to flood the market with more coins and taking the risk that at someday it is their coins being redistributed because he cannot move them for 3 years.
And I think that by the end of the year, almost every bitcoin hardfork that follows and hasn't overwhelming consensus will be less and less relevant. Of course some groups may split that represent a few percent of the community, but hopefully it won't happen too often.

It is a digital currency that has no central authority, it is permissionless to enter or to send transactions, it is immutable and the records are not reversible. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, with a set distribution that halves every 4 years and ends ~2140 a.d.
You could move money in by sending some from your bank account to an exchange, buy some and transfer them to a wallet you control the private keys of. Getting paid in bitcoins is an alternative.
Do some reading to understand what you are buying. The sidebar, the faq and the whitepaper of Satoshi Nakamoto would be a good start i guess.

Today I spoke with a guy who does some sports betting and poker and after a while I mentioned bitcoin. He imediately said that it will tank because the creator revealed himself as some Australian guy. It is so crazy what power uninformed media pieces have over people.
He wouldn't believe me that it's not him. He read it.

Or how his rockets power bitcoin.

You can decide that for yourself. There is no official decision or definition making.
Without always being clear, there are definately some types of transactions I'd call spam.

21 million is a random number. No matter how tiny the amount will be due to lost coins, that amount can be splitted to units where everyone can use it. One satoshi would be enough for the entire economy.

I think it is ok to spend 5-10% of the whole investment to make sure it is as safe as possible.

Very good.
It is the original hardware wallet. They wrote the code, which is open source and used by the others.
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:04:01
Yeah, I agree with that. But in the financial context and for the ability to form a functioning economy it has no meaning. 
At least theoretically, maybe it will be given meaning by some. 
What I can think of is implementing a very low inflation if there show up real problems with this hard cap (and if there is consensus for that). But most of us probably won't be alive by the time that would become relevant.

Have you claimed your BCH on the trezor? 
Maybe a similiar process could be implemented if the fork actually happens and has any reasonable value after a while.
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:57:13
I don't think so. It doesn't really matter if there are 20 million in circulation or 2 million or even just 2. If we attach a lot of value (which happens if there is a shortage of supply and strong demand) to a 1 millionth of a btc, it will be enough.
Also by now I don't think that many more millions of coins will get lost (if the value holds ofc).

As far as I know Germans are pretty big into bitcoin. A lot of nodes per capita (in comparison) hint to that.
But I agree on everything you said.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:20:13
No, if the fork does not happen

No, but it improves the overall robustness and security of Bitcoin.
