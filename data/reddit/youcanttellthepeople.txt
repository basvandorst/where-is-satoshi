This.  As I explained to a friend, it's all relative. Sure the fees are high in terms of Satoshis, but the actual fiat value is only relevant if your converting back in the short term.  
The amount of times I've been told by people that haven't even dipped their toes in the market "but fees though", have all been informed by mainstream media's use of the dollar for those fees.

Ordered mine yesterday - looking forward to getting my hands on it!

They didn't - 2008 was the financial system collapse, which is when they started printing a shedload of money to prop the system up.  Bitcoin was created out of Satoshi's vision to never have to see anything like that again.

I've not used bitaddress myself, but  is good.  Got full instructions and explains what to be cautious of etc.  The paper itself is not important - it's what's on it that is - the private key.  Basically don't divulge it to anyone.  You'll get 2 bits of text on the paper wallet - the public and private key.  You can use the public side to receive funds - so from others, buying for yourself etc., and the private key is to only use when spending.
That said, with paper wallets never spend from them directly.  Always spend it in one go (ie. send it to another address).  It's also known as a 'sweep'.  Too long to go into here, but if you only spend part of it, the rest (the change) will go to a change address, which you may not know.  The old paper wallet will be empty - even if you only spent say, 0.2 BTC out of 1 - the rest would go to the change address.  Just bear that in mind - best thing to do with cold storage is basically hold it.
This post explains the process quite well : 
Hope that helps somewhat - and apologies if you know alot of this stuff already!

Done! :)

I don't believe so.  It gets harder sure, but from what I understand the last coin will be mined in around 2140, or something like that.

Took the bait - nice one! :D

Excellent explanation - thanks!

I'm the same, but in the end decided I'd take the hit and just import my paper into electrum and then send them over to the ledger. Bit of a pita, as you say there's nothing yet that'll allow you to do it via direct import :(

You may have paid same day transfer, but I'm pretty sure that's from their (boa) end, not the international end. It'll still take time to get across, which is why Coinbase stipulate the time frames on their site.  Not defending it - but it normally takes around 4-5 days so day 3 you're still well within the limits, I'm sorry to say :(

He's not missed the boat - he just doesn't get it.

Hahah snap! I knew it'd gone to far the other week when I tried to explain to my wife about the hard fork.  I used ACTUAL forks to represent the Blockchain, and 2 additional forks to represent the hard fork. With pound coins showing the split coins. And a hair band for the block when the fork would take place.
She got it - but man that's when I realised I've become obsessed.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:04:10
Now that's a much better answer :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:03:03
Yeah I've had similar conversations like this in the office.  The one that's used the most is 'but my pounds are backed by government, military and nuclear missiles'.
I just replied BTC is backed by the whole world. Still doesn't get it - even after god knows how many conversations and pointers to vids on YouTube :/
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:42:40
But then surely that same counter argument works with nukes - can't pay debts with them afaik.  Unless you obliterate the creditor with them, of course ;)

That was a great book. Out of curiosity what'd he say?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:02:47
I'm not an expert so I'll let someone else fill in any gaps, but I basically created what's called a paper wallet - which you generate through a HTML page you download and run it offline ( This'll give you your private key and wallet address. Then it's just a case of sending your BTC coins in Coinbase to your new wallet address.
Best thing is to do a small amount first, then check the wallet address on blockexplorer to make sure it goes through ok. Once you're happy, send the rest.
Caveat here is never spend the coins or transfer them a 'bit at a time' from the paper wallet. Treat it like a safe you can't get into without breaking it. When you need to get the coins, do something known as a 'sweep' by sending the lot to a new wallet etc, otherwise it'll expose the wallet and I believe it can also result in double spends (not 100% sure on this one but hopefully someone can explain it better than me).
If you're talking big bucks then it's best to get a hardware wallet like a trezor or nano ledger s. Cold storage is basically saying 'offline'. 
Hope that helps!
(Oh and if you do a paper wallet - don't lose it!!!!!)

As a bit of a noob on this - how come this stuff isn't making mainstream headlines in 'traditional' media? This to me makes an incredible, ongoing story that's almost unbelievable - yet the evidence is clearly there that it's happening. 
Sure, I get crypto isn't exactly mainstream - but smaller stories than this on traditional markets make headline business news all the time. But this? Just puzzled so if anyone can enlighten me I'd be much obliged :)

I know it's easier said than done, but try not to worry too much. I had a similar issue - I sent funds from an account that wasn't in my name - and heard nothing for over a week.  I contacted them a few times but 'eventually' got hold of someone, and they assured me the money was being sent back.  It took over 2 weeks, but it did make it - irrespective of the lack of comms.  Hopefully it's going to be the same for you.  I did contact my own bank to advise them of my concerns - they said if I didn't get anything back from them to let them know and they'd get their foreign payments team to raise an exception with them on my behalf.  Fingers crossed for you.

I must admit I was worried as well at the lack of response. It sounded to me like they're understaffed and oversubscribed. But that's just my opinion :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:00:23
That article is so misleading.  Nowhere in it does 'he' say it's a bubble - he just says it's not a risk to the economy and people should do their homework before getting in - which, to be fair, is actually sound advice.
Typical BBC sensationalism. They've really gone downhill over the last few years :(

I'm a gamer and funnily enough was thinking about updating my card (gtx 980ti) for a 1080ti, but prices in the UK at least put me off. Personally I think the retailers are using the crypto line as a way of bumping up the prices, as if you ask the general Joe they'll say the prices are up due to bitcoin. I don't know how many times people have said that to me, and they're surprised when I explain that bitcoin miners at least don't generally use them anymore.
So if most of the populace think 'hey, it's due to bitcoin so I guess that's not going to change anytime soon', then the retailers are going to cash in on that without question.
1070 prices are stupid - around £600 for one online. They were about £400 a few months back.

Congrats! Welcome to the club ��
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:07:55
I highly doubt it. You don't own the private key, thus it follows you don't own the bitcoin.
