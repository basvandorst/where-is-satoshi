Can't any other coin already move across borders?

How about any other coin?

Dumb question here. I know GDAX fees are virtually free if you use it right. But what about actually making a purchase? It links from my Coinbase wallet or I have to send it from my Coinbase wallet. Are either of those free? How can I actually purchase Crypto from GDAX for free using my bank account?

This is great! Can I ask for spoilers? You said it has been won. Who won? Also given than you know so much history, can you explain to me how the "conspiracy" or maybe truth that people who are in supporting Bitcoin Cash are apposed to Bitcoin because Chinese miners are controlling it somehow and how it relates to Bitcoin?

That is the speculation part, however what about the technology. Ethereum is lauded as an essential fuel for applications to run, and for cryptocurrency to be used. What do you say to that?

I see, so that means they're both essentially very compatible with each other? Is that technology a probable implementation in the future? Or speculation? If this is the case I can see Litecoin rise by a lot!

It doesn't involve you sending money to anyone in any way so I'm not sure what you're so afraid of. I'm going to PM him see what the opportunity is.

The secret to success is to be ready for opportunity when it comes.

Are there 10 ATMs there or not?
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:16:26
Did you guys read the article, there's 10 ATMs. The title is clickbait, but if you read, we're talking about 10 ATMs, way more than the national average of 0.
