A lot of people still think you a) need to buy whole coins, b) they're physical things.
There willl be 2 real waves of adoption, one is like overstock where people are accepting BTC being exchanged to USD, the second will be when people are accepting BTC as BTC, and skipping exchanges.
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:03:56
1) We all know BTC is most cost efficient for merchants, flat tiny transaction fees.  Right off the bat amazon would save upwards of 2% off Paypall / CC fees.  That alone is an amazing reason for amazon to accept btc.
2) BTC has no chargebacks.  While amazon has a decent rma/constumer service, it doesn't stop them from experiencing huge losses from payment fraud, or people doing charge backs from  CC or Paypal.
3) If Amazon was inclined, they could pass on their payment/processing savings on to customers and offer bitcoin discounts, or things like free shipping with btc payments.  Some sort of value for the customer.  Very much how many stores have a cash price.
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:11:56
This is the best bet because the exchange is basically a huge mixer, and the fees would be almost nothing.  Use an Exchange like cryptsy which doesn't require verification.

When you sell on an exchange it doesn't do a transaction, unless this person was depositing btc in order to sell it.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:45:32
Well, It's exactly like cash.  If you pay a contractor cash to do a job, then you'd best hope they did a good job.  If you pay with btc over the internet, you're trusting the person.   Paypal was built as a layer of security between you and the merchant, btc is the opposite.  This is the whole point of btc, is that there isn't any nanny watching online purchases.
If you want protection and safety nets, there's fees associated with that.  If that's what you want, use a credit card / paypal.  In my mind, it goes like this, risky purchases, CC/PP with buyer protection, once you can trust the merchant, move to BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:47:19
Also, it's not like every gang-banger looking for snoops next album is going to go out and buy btc just to buy a cd.  Realistically if a new product is released for BTC than you'll see roughly 1% or less of sales be in btc.  Unless snoop is saying, he's ONLY selling for btc, in which case his album is going to get torrented to oblivion.

@_date: 2014-01-06 18:52:38
There just isn't much to spend it on, additionally, with market peaks more people want to spend btc on stuff, when it's low, people don't want to waste btc on suff.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:21:30
I'm assuming that the merchants are using bitpay, which handles all of the BTC/USD conversion, and charges somewhere like $30 total for all fees, even with their most expensive package at $3k/month would be a trivial amount compared to CC fees.  So you're completely insulated from market spread/USD conversion fees, bank deposit fees, everything.
Assuming margins are pretty tight at amazon, I'd say 2% fees are probably in the 5-10% of profit range, a non-trivial amount.


There's actually less hoops.  Assuming you have btc, checkout consists of sending btc to an address, no entering credit card info, or personal billing info into online forms.

I know this is going to go against the grain, but I think the news that chinese exchanges are faking volume means that they can be considered less relevant to the global bitcoin market.  The fact that Huobi may only have 1/10th the volume it's showing is good, it means that if China shut's down BTC in exchanges in their country, the loss wont be felt throughout the btc world. 
It means that the other exchanges, and the global market is actually far more representative of the value of BTC and means that the global market can support BTC at where it is.  If it turns out china doesn't matter, then it means we don't need to worry about chinese markets being restricted.

Doesn't really work like that.  MT.Gox would hold all their user's cash as cash, and all coins as coins.

Unless of course, they were sketch, and decided to invest their customer's funds, in an attempt to make gains on the fiat they were holding in which case, that would be a serious problem.

Wait for BTC to stabilize.  Right now, there' very few people using it, and it's very volatile.  Even gold fluctuates a LOT and it's been used as a precious metal for thousands of years.  Since BTC is international and uncontrolled, there' very little to keep it's value in check.
No one have a fixed income based on flat BTC, no one's listing prices in BTC.    Even if BTC is a payment technology, I still think it's awesome.
It doesn't have to be stable to be useful or valuable.

Virtex is like $30 wire fee up to $5000, then a 1.5% trade commission, then a 0.0005 btc withdrawl fee.
So assuming you're buying 1 BTC at a time, it works out to be 
888 * 1.015 (trade commission) + 30 wire transfer $931.32 to buy one $888 bitcoin.  If you're buying anywhere less than that much, the atm becomes cheaper to use than Virtex, if you're buying more than that Virtex becomes cheaper.
Virtex offers a $5 online bill payment system through vogogo, but certain banks (TD Canada trust for example) and credit unions do not support vogogo.
For quickly and easily acquiring or selling less than $1000 of BTC it's definitely a much easier proposition, and much faster.  Virtex is a minimum 2-4  day deposit turn around.

Well, The idea is that Fiat exchanges will turn into entrance and exit points.  Most people wont be interested in actual tradding, and will be looking for a place where they can simply easily get in and out of btc/ fiat.  
I think the ATMs are going to be really popular, but for real exchanges, and especially if the other cryptos pick up more, then a p2p crypto only exchange would be very nice, and would probably be everyone's preferred choice.  It's great to be able to exchange fiat, but for most people doing trading they aren't interested in fiat, they're trading alt currencies to make gains in BTC.

CaVirtex offers a sort of "pre paid debit card" that you essentially send BTC to, and then it's usable at any atm  / business.  You Could send your BTC there, and then withdraw cash from an ATM.

If it is true, than we're looking at about 4-6 months of problems while the police do all their investigating and gather as much info as possible, they may even be forcing Gox to increase their user info in order to get people to voluntarily give themselves up.  If the Police have compromised some popular tumblers, and are just waiting for people to cash out, then camping exchanges is the place to do it.
It would be interesting to see if there's a trend in people getting shut down out of withdrawls (US citizens, Tax evasion targets, People with a transaction history going back to black markets etc).

I really feel like anyone buying goods with BTC right now, understands that a store isn't going to refund BTC.  Especially a major retailer, additionally, I think the idea that a major retailer is accepting btc would get people much more excited that they really wouldn't care about terms, especially that they're only guaranteed the ability to a refund in USD.  To be fair the value of USD fluctuates on a daily basis.  I constantly buy things from steam/other US online businesses in USD, but I'm paying in CAD being converted to USD.  The exchange rate changes, I wouldn't expect to get refunded my pre-conversion CAD amount back, I would expect that the store would refund the sticker price (listed in USD).
Virgin galactic specifically said, they must immediately convert BTC to USD, and then only offer USD refunds to space flight customers, for the exact reason you're describing.

What if the NSA has owned mt.Gox, and are trying to build a list of people with BTC, in order to hit people with income tax cases?

The wait staff should have their own address printed below the main bill.
Putting it on their name tag/ shirt or whatever is interesting, and offer a bit of interaction with the customer, but it would be more efficient to present it next to the bill, then the employer would just have to provide a way for the wait staff to easily convert their tips into Fiat if they don't want to keep btc.

If you're afraid of the market sit 50:50 with your investments.  
Diversity is the key, because you don't want 1 wrong choice to wipe you out.  
Things seems stable, but I feel like if it goes any direction it'll go down a bit before it goes up.  If you're nervous, and want to make sure you can capitalize on a dip, sit at 50-75% btc, and keep the rest in a buy order that's as low as you think it'll go.
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:12:12
I think so too.  I feel like it's the big step everyone's waiting for. If a company like Amazon started accepting BTC, then you could buy everything with BTC, and you could trust Amazon, because they're a huge mainstream entity that has a physical presence that you could press charges against if they defrauded you.

During the downspike , I just kept posting to hold.  It's one thing to buy high, it's another thing to sell low.  Look at April, if you bought at ATH of april you'd be sitting on 400% gains right now.  If you bought at ATH of April, and sold at the lowest point of the crash you'd still be up over 100% for 6 months of holding...  Even if you purchased on credit card cash advances, you'd still be ahead. 
If the market crashes, that's the WORST time to sell, just hold it, you don't gain anything from selling and it WILL rally, then you just have regret about selling low.

Well 4 years ago, I bought 10btc at just under $1000, was stupid, left them in an exchange (cryptsy) came back to check on them last nov after Trump got elected, and figured the price would go up, and found out that Cryptsy had evaporated. So I got mad, and thought about getting back into BTC and alt trading, but couldn't really spare the money to take another crack at it.  At that time BTC was about $1500. Now here I am about a year later, nad it's at almost $6000. If I'd just swallowed my loss, scrapped together some money, and gotten back in and been smart I'd have made up the lost cash and then some.  I hate past self for sure, just for being too lazy to offline everything, and then being too intimitaded to try again.

Apple is  a "nanny state"  style company, they want to protect their users, btc is still very easy to screw up, and there's no overlord that can come fix user's mistakes.  I wonder if someone could provide a wallet verification system, where you basically send a tiny transaction to and then back from a wallet, just to verify, before sending the full transaction through.  Sort of like the connection header from a tcp connection.
So like, it would cost a couple extra transactions, but for a larger transfer, that you want to be sure, you could send a satoshi to the target, they could send one back, then you send through the 0.5btc or whatever the larger transaction was. I'm sure people would love to have a "Verify address first" checkbox that costs a little extra to send.

The only reason why the FBI went public on this is because they thought they were going to watch someone get murdered or they realized that Basically, they'd mined enough information out of the site, and weren't really going to get much else or that the fake IDs DPR was buying to "get more servers" may have been something to leave the country with.

Well, the number 1 is simply a run, one day someone sells a big chunk, because they're just done, and want out, so the price drops, and someone else, sees it, and goes "oh Noes!" and sells. THen the price drops again.  Then more people think this is it, BTC is tanking, and everyone sells, and the price hits $50 before people start saying, "Holy shit, BTC is @ $50 buy buy buy buy buy buy buy. Then it comes back up.
Part 2, Is Retailers start saying "fuck bitcoin, we're not using it anymore, it's too agro"  Then as the practical purpose becomes less and less, people decide to get out of it, and then scenario 1 happens.

The situation is that the current price is based on speculation, people think in the future it will be worth x. but people keep cashing out. Merchant's acceptance fuels what the actual price will be.  Right now it's daunting to accept BTC as a merchant unless you know it will be a trivial margin of your business, and are basically just considering it fun money or whatever, because the price is so volotile, you may not turn a profit at the end if all your sales were during a peak, and supplier billing time is during a slump.  I think Merchants selling for BTC, need to be more on the fixed BTC price rather than some kind of instant market index conversion price.
Start charging 0.015 btc for a pack of smokes or whatever.  Then slowly raise or lower that fixed price based on what you think the market should be worth.  The last thing you want is some ass hole waiting in line at subway, saying, wait.. wait....wait....O.K. NOW!

2 rules, to follow for safe BTC investing, if you want to play it safe.
1) Never sell.  BTC is so unpredictable, it's hard to tell when it'll peak, unless you REALLY know your shit, worst case scenario, you lose the ability to potentially increase your holdings.
2) Whenever you can, add fiat to your exchange account then buy when you think it's not inflated.  Don't focus on trying to sell at the right time, that's actually really hard, and it's when you can get screwed hard.  Just focus on adding fiat, and making smart buys. 
This is on the assumption that later down the line as we've seen BTC always goes up with adoption.  It'll go nuts, and yeah, you can increase your holdings playing the candlestick game, but you can also get obliterated.  So if you're nervous, just relax, don't worry about "missed profit", the price will eventually go up again, it's not as exciting as selling @ 900, then buying at 550 2 hours later, but at least you're not setting yourself up for a heart attack.  
Buy at the low, hold as much as you can, ride it to the moon.  When you want to "cash out" start spending BTC on things, don't sell it all on the exchange.
**edit**: Secretely, everyone wants a crash so they can buy cheap btc, and a lot of people, will post all kinds of bull shit to try to fuck you.  Remember Kevin Rose posting about why he's cashing out at 350.  Yeah, fuck that guy, it's 600+ now a week later.  We're still celebrating each coffee shop that starts taking BTC.  The ride hasn't even started yet!

You can't get around giving them your banking info for verification, it's required by law for them to do a verification process.  Fill out your applications and be patient.  If you're looking to send less than $1000 you'd be better off going to a btc meet up and trying to buy some with cash.  You're looking at around $30ish in fees to send money.  So sending $100 isn't really worth it.

You understand, that a BTC bank can do the same thing. The whole point of BTC is that you don't need a bank at all, you can do all your money saving and transmitting safely and securely from your cellphone / pc.

Not sure, talk to an accountant, I'm guessing you would pay capital gains on the market value of the bitcoins at the time you traded them.  You would need a receipt, and time stamp or something.  It would be in a really wierd place, because assume you had like a signed Babe Ruth rookie card, and you traded it for a car.  However that would work, would be how bitcoins would work.

BTC is not a threat to the government or the economy.  It is basically just a super efficient way of sending money, and is at most an amazing tool.   It is a way for individuals to control their own money, but more importantly it is transparent.  It is easier to prove payments were made with BTC than with cash.
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:54:14
That's the real question.  If the nsa would use this to steal BTC why wouldn't they use it to steal USD.  I don't think the NSA will use this to steal BTC anymore than they would use it to steal your Bank information, or your World of Warcraft account.  There's no point, and it's not their mission.
The only time they would be used would be if bitcoins were banned.

Point and case, with bitcoin it's all about patience, especially if you buy during a bubble, just wait it out, btc will rise, it's the honey badger.  Just leave you money in BTC wait until June next year, and it'll spike to $2k easy.  THis time next year maybe even $3-$4k

The answer to this is that Merchants would MUCH favour bitcoin. So much that they would probably offer a non-trivial discount, and thus if you already trust the merchant, aka amazon / new-egg / whatever, then you don't really have anything to lose by paying with BTC, and you get a decent savings.

To fully qualify this response, the truth, is, leave your money in BTC, now is definitely the time to buy or hold, there is no way to win off selling right now, at best you're potentially mitigating short term loss, but realistically, selling now is probably making the absolute worst of the situation.    You should wait 6 months at least before selling.  Which is why everyone always says  never invest more than you can lose, because you never want to be forced to sell.

I feel like, the whole "not enough to go around" doesn't really come into play, as the more people want it, the more supply exists.  As the price increases, so does the market cap / total capacity of the currency.  Since it can be infinitely subdivided, "21 million" is just an arbritrary number. The number doesn't matter.  Since the value is dynamic.
The danger will  be that people don't spend them, and the infrastructure doesn't build.  If people are only buying btc, and selling btc for fiat, then it'll be a lot more vulnerable than if people are simply switching to BTC instead of FIAT.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:08:45
This is what Kruger's Article was talking about.  He's saying, since there's nothing to depreciate a bitcoin, ie supply will only slow until the maximum, there will never be a "Good time" to sell, supply will always slow, and they don't decay.  The only time that will be a good time to sell is literally right before a potential crash.  Even with Gold, there's always more gold coming into the market. ADditionally, gold is still consumed to produce jewlery, which people buy as a consumer good.  So there's a legit concrete demand for it to fall back on, even if people stop investing in it.
With bitcoins, there's no industry that uses bitcoins.  There's no constant demand for bitcoins, there's no governement collecting taxes in the form of bitcoins.  It is a truely pure currency, its value is based solely on how much people want it.  If people stop wanting it, then it's worth nothing, and there's nothing to force people into having to have it.
It's an economist's /sociologists dream observational experiment, but it's super risky!  It's a very good way of converting wealth around.  It WILL continue to be an excellent way to store, and transfer wealth.  The problem, is that Since it's fluctuating a lot, it's hard to justify spending it.  Especially with the Pain in the ass of acquiring more of it.
It takes me 5 days, + transfer fees + exchange fees to get bitcoins.  It takes me a swipe of my debit card to get cash, or spend it.
Proliferation is key!  The more people use it as a currency, the better the future is.  The more people hoard it, the more it will be a bubble.  If people treat it like a money making investment, there will be a crash.  If people treat it like a currency and buy things, it will be bigger than the USD.

Set a sell for 1/2 your btc at %20 more than your average buy and walk away.  Or better yet, Cold storage all your BTC, throw it in a bank.  At worst, you see btc hit 0 and you lose whatever you put in.  At best, you wait until the next bubble ( probably 6-8 months) and then sell then.  there have been 5 or 6 bubbles in the past.  They've all seen 200%+ gains over previous bubbles ATH.  You're still an early adopter. Just sit on them.  There's no reason to realize a lost position on an asset that's seeing %1000 yearly growth.
This is of course assuming you've followed the golden rule of "don't invest more than you can afford to lose".  Right now, assume the value is $0, and it's all gone, every penny you put in is gone.  Then just wait until it's true and you've already accepted it, or until it has gone main stream enough that you've made back at least what you put in if not more.

This is the class system in a nut shell.  I have several groups of friends from different backgrounds.  I have some friends who are very well off, and some who are poor.   Most of my well off friends I left behind when I moved out of my home town, but we Play Paintball, go Snowboarding, golf all kinds of awesome stuff, we all routinely buy each other drinks etc, no one worries about who's paying for what or whatever, if we're hanging out, and I order a Pizza, I pick up the bill because I know next time someone else will.
When I'm hanging out with my less well off friends, everyone's watching their budget.  "Want to go to this concert?" " How much are the tickets? Money etc".  Everyone's counting pennies constantly. 
 So you tend to end up hanging more with people in your socio-economic situation, because you basically can behave the same.  It's wierd.  
With BTC, people just want to know how invested you are in the market when your telling them.  I think it's less about determining your wealth, but they're interested and the amount of money you're in for determines your confidence.

Just to be fair, you could have walked in with a briefcase full of money, and purchased it instantly.
Then you say, "but what if the cash was stolen"? what if your phone was stolen?  Or hot wallet compromised, etc.
There is a fundamental difference between the process of acquiring financing and purchasing something with cash(including btc as cash).
Not saying BTC isn't great for this exact same purchase, I'd just avoid making straw man arguments. 
Credit cards are going to fall hard once merchants start to realize they can accept BTC, particularly high value merchants like furniture / cars/ houses.

This is exactly like when people first started buying things online with VISA, and PayPal came out with a buffer of security for people.  People want someone they can go to to fix it when they fuck up. 
Although it goes against a lot of what bitcoin was built for, something like Verified Bitcoin wallets, would go a long way to "knowing" that the recipient is legit.  Even if it's just a tumbler.  Knowing that wallet X belongs to Y, and that you can call the police, if Y steals from you, goes a long way into building trust, and moving BTC into the realm of Average Joe.

If a drug dealer got money, and paid a taxi to drive him to the deal would be a closer analogy I think.  You're not getting a cut of the drug money, you're just getting paid to do your job that happened to be for a drug dealer.

I assume the kit that is required to accept BTC would be the same kit for any crypto currency.  Switching can't be that hard, especially after you've gotten used to handling a crypto currency.  I mean, I think it would just add more crypto currencies to the market.  I don't think it would deflate BTC, I think it could just co-exist.

Here's the thing, as much as we're like fuck the banks, the fact is, once the 1% gets into BTC, They'll go De Beers on it, and push the prices to the moon.  Currency inflation gives people a reason to not sit on vast stock piles of money in cold storage, with a deflating currency, bit coins will continue to grow in value, even in cold storage, that's why people are saying they may be worth $1million each, if bitcoins get onto the scale of the USD.  Right now if there's roughly $15 trillion of USD in existance, then that 21million BTC cap would math out to almost $800k per bitcoin to make up the difference.

You buy 5 million feather coins at $1 a coin, and just sell it to users at $20 a coin. Instantly every exchange matches your prices because anyone selling for less than $20 will see FB fixing their price, and users still buying it.
you make $95 million, and secure the market.  You switch all your users to Feather coin.

I feel like, speculation causes the spike, then people who are speculators will think that that's it, and will sell, and then it'll go down, and then most speculators will sell, but the people who are actually growing the value, aren't in it for speculation, and they'll keep onto their coins, regardless, because they're using the coins for their intended purpose, they're not using them to make money, so there's no reason to leave.
Then all the press about bitcoins will have attracted more real users, and they will stick around, and in the end, speculators in, speculators out, but more real adopters in.
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:43:04
So Is anyone else thinking that this isn't a spike, but that $400, might be the new norm?  Seems crazy, but, anything can happen with Btc, I've read respectable math putting the current value at somewhere like $1000/btc but that it hasn't properly corrected yet.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:58:10
I think $1000 is where it's going.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:46:22
Just got off the phone with virtex, and they just verified me.  Oh well, I was readdy to buy in at a moment's notice all last week, but now seeing the price at 800+ I'm not sure if we're due for a big correction or not, would hate to finally get approved just in time to buy at $850 just before a drop to $400....

So basically, this guy is trying to bail out, he's someone cashing out, and basically, just saying "sell at whatever price people are willing to pay"  He put $1 because he figured, I'll just take whatever and I  want to sell NAO, no matter the price I receive.  I don't understand why you wouldn't put at least a reasonable limit like 20% or something.  Surely taking a 99.5% loss isn't worth the time of selling them "right away".  That being said, if he did have a second account, sitting with  very HIGH buy volume, but with a lower limit, he would deplete the buy depth, and then the second account could scoop up the rest of his own bitcoins, thus pushing the buy depth down, and reducing the cost to buy, if he was going to re-invest. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:12:10
I'd assume that He would have had something like back-ups of the site somewhere, so if they were edited in, they wouldn't be in the back-ups.
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:59:49

I feel like this is the huge under ground thing that's about to happen, and will be like e-bay or whatever in the next 5 - 10 years.  But given it's open source nature, I'm still weary about as someone said, starting a completely new block chain, complete with miners, and everything, but back by something like Facebook, which would just instantaneously eclipse the market value of the existing bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:37:43
Day traders exploiting BTC's volatility will not make it succeed, they will siphon money out of the economy.  Day traders are not here for the long haul.  They are going to be getting in, selling at the first spike, and causing instability.  They will manipulate the market.
Pump and Dumps will scare away legitimate adoption. We want long term speculators, and real adoption.

There is Any charity can ask, or specifically announce that they are now accepting bitcoins.  It's sort of a quid pro quo thing, if you're accepting btc and want btc donations, displaying the BTC logo on your charity's homepage is a nice step forwards, and will go a long way to encouraging people to donate.
I think the key is, you can post news, like "We've started acceepting BTC" but avoid posts like "Please give btc here, we're a good cause".

I think they just want to do what they can to help it be safe for everyone, much like what they did with Credit Cards / Banking in general, but no one really understands it.  I don't think they want to squash it at all, they just want to avoid scames, because especially as BTC is so permanent, it's currently in a state of buyer beware, because the seller doesn't have any power either.  
Bitcoins actually give merchants a LOT more power, which is good because, Mechants are the ones who can submit to regulations because they have a lot more invested in their reputation / operations.
A customer, at most is going to be out a few hundred dollars? for a big online purchase?  A store will have a lot more at stake, especially a reputable.
If I send Amazon.com BTC for a purchase, I have no fear. I have a public transaction, I have a digital receipt, I know exactly where my money went.
BTC is BETTER for large corporations than Visa / PayPal. Because as long as they know they're right, and they can't be jerked around by payment fraud.  It's better for customers too, because there's no identity theft possible.
