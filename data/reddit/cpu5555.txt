The units of money have no intrinsic value. There is always the risk of sharp decline in value.

The short story is people are using the real deal when it is not ready.
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:24:26
I always read the email addresses before hitting the links.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:42:21
Is there an iPhone version of this?
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:21:24
The title is misleading.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:37:12
I wish them well. I also think this is good news.
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:14:55
The Bitcoin community needed to fix the scaling problem a long time ago.
@_date: 2015-12-01 15:37:37
I support raising the block size to 8 MB.
@_date: 2018-09-27 02:14:33
Zero Hedge is a sketchy site.
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:45:24
It is unlikely Bitcoin will hit $1,000,000.
@_date: 2014-10-01 01:38:41
That is disappointing. People will also find ways around the tax.
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:20:40
Gold, it cannot go to zero the way Bitcoin can.
@_date: 2014-11-22 05:06:41
I have used cex.io and I did not earn a good return on investment. You should just hold on to your Bitcoins for now.
@_date: 2014-06-25 16:00:34
@_date: 2014-07-14 20:20:58
The problem with this analysis is that the traditional banks and Bitcoin both have ATM's. While Bitcoin may reduce reliance on banks, it will not get rid of it entirely.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:34:05
That is hilarious.
@_date: 2014-11-22 04:58:41
The problem though is that Bitcoin cannot replace existing currency for non electronic transactions. Besides that, Bitcoin has no value outside of money.
@_date: 2014-06-18 03:12:31
I like how they not only include not only Bitcoin but they also include other crypto-currencies.
@_date: 2014-10-13 00:15:38
The websites weusecoins.com and bitcoin.org are both good websites.
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:32:59
This is disappointing. Bitcoin keeps a written record of transactions. Cash does not need a written record.
@_date: 2014-09-03 21:52:07
Google should start accepting Bitcoin for it's paid services.
@_date: 2014-12-01 05:08:31
Gold has value outside of money. It has industrial uses too. Bitcoin has no value outside of money.
@_date: 2014-10-17 03:55:19
Well that is disappointing.
@_date: 2014-08-15 19:58:50
The $100 bill has plenty of legitimate uses.
@_date: 2014-08-25 21:17:51
There are some people who still pay by check. It is not as common today but it still happens.
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:20:57
That is a phishing attack. You need to report it as soon as possible.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:12:50
The Federal Reserve is not a private institution. While the government needs to limit its powers, it should not make it more socialist than it already is.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:05:31
I agree with you. While a Bitcoin ATM is great as a concept, the current ones out there have serious problems.
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:33:32
Why is that?
@_date: 2014-09-13 03:49:16
This is off topic.
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:13:51
I would not want to use this service myself. The government taxes are too high.
@_date: 2014-11-23 04:36:41
While I think Bitcoin will take off, I also think people should listen to concerns others have about it. The worst thing that can happen to Bitcoin is that it loses market share to a better crypto-currency.
@_date: 2014-10-13 00:26:12
The financial industry may actually embrace Bitcoin. While some may try to fight it, others may include Bitcoin in their business.
@_date: 2014-12-02 05:52:23
I am glad you pointed that out. While I like the concept of a Bitcoin ATM, I do not like some of the Bitcoin ATM's out there.
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:34:00
This was something I was expecting for a while now.
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:59:22
I feel bad for you.
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:32:36
This is out dated. Groupon has backed off on the trademark.
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:21:12
I just checked and the prices are even lower.
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:49:43
Unfortunately, this is not available in Texas.
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:33:59
That makes sense. The price in Bitcoin has dropped
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:22:10
It is real money you can exchange for fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:03:48
I will not quit my job. Bitcoin is not supposed to be used to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:54:10
Bitcoin could crash at anytime. You should invest in Bitcoin when the prices are stable. I also recommend teaching yourself about economics. This is an issue of making sure you don't get burned when there is a crash.
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:43:31
The units in Bitcoin have no value or utility outside of money. Bitcoin can go to zero at anytime.
@_date: 2017-03-03 02:19:31
You should wait for it to crash before you buy.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:28:18
Wait until after the crash before buying.
@_date: 2017-03-03 02:13:37
It reads out like a sign Bitcoin may crash. The people selling may be trying to cash out.
@_date: 2018-10-04 04:15:00
Thanks for the PSA.
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:49:00
This is what we need to hear. We talk to much about rising prices and get rich quick schemes. Adoption is critical.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:44:29
Well said
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:54:42
This is good news indeed.
@_date: 2016-11-10 18:26:30
Bitcoin is not like gold. Gold has utility outside of money. Bitcoin does not.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:59:47
Bitcoin is not anonymous. It usees wallet addresses. It is also not untraceable.
@_date: 2019-06-17 01:06:57
I hate cloud mining too. I should not have tried it.
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:42:59
Congrats, I'm glad you are making good use of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:53:12
The Daily Mail is not trustworthy.
@_date: 2015-08-01 04:11:56
I cannot view the video.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:29:06
The government should target neither the tax avoiders nor the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:28:23
I cannot access it.

Wrong subreddit
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:51:53
You read my mind
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:45:29
I mistrusted this guy for a while.
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:41:03
Nice satire
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:55:46
Wether Bitcoin lasts or not, the concept and premise will live on.
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:30:45
That is great news. Thank you for not posting about the Bitcoin exchange rate.
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:28:07
Well said. I want to see updates, discussions, and articles that don't revolve around price.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:36:56
I agree with what you said. Thanks
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:05:50
This is blessing. I have never used Mt. Gox. I feel bad for those who lost their money.
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:06:30

All VPNs will work with your iPhone. The OpenVPN client is available on the iPhone. I need to know how you are going to use the VPN and the country you will use it in to give you advice.
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:26:26
They think having more spending and less saving is good. While spending is good, too much is bad because the money will have less value from rising demand for goods.
@_date: 2015-04-16 02:01:22
There are other exchanges for obtaining Ripple currency.
@_date: 2015-04-13 03:54:13
The price of Bitcoin will increase. As the block reward halves, miners start selling half the amount of Bitcoin. If the demand remains the same, the price should increase because of a drop in supply.
@_date: 2015-04-05 00:16:58
It's a scam.
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:41:20
This is a misleading title for this post
@_date: 2015-04-16 13:46:35
The stronger identity requirements on Ripple Trade. The Ripple website mentions other exchanges.
@_date: 2015-09-06 23:43:08
Browser attacks allow malware to get in.
@_date: 2015-11-01 01:16:56
Bitcoin does not need anymore sex related services. It needs other services.
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:24:27
The same goes for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:37:35
The other problem is there are things happening that damage the credibility of Bitcoin. This includes price swings, use in illegal markets, failed exchanges, and difficulty obtaining it.
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:18:32
Bitcoin is valuable because of the value the market gives it. Because Bitcoin is in demand, the price rises. There is always the risk of it going to zero. Fiat money has the same problem. Gold has value and utility outside of money. Fiat money and Bitcoin don't.
Bitcoin is changing the way we do transactions. It makes it easier to move money from point A to point B. So Bitcoin is great ignoring the fact that it has no value outside of money.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:56:00
Same here

I don't use 4chan. I have heard bad things about it.

I don't need to send money back to India. I just like hearing good news about my family's home country.
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:21:40
Bitcoin could always crash.
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:33:08
That is just stupid and unconstitutional.
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:05:13
I wished more people realized this.
@_date: 2015-02-19 00:24:01
The U.S. wireless carriers should accept Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:39:08
As someone who has a family from India, I love this.
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:25:42
Bitcoin mining in general is no longer profitable.
@_date: 2016-07-11 05:32:15
A better digital currency system comes along.
@_date: 2017-06-10 04:10:46
This reminds me of when CEX.io suspended its cloud mining indefinitely.
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:51:00
No. You should stick with buying from bitcoin exchanges. Do not keep money in the exchange.
