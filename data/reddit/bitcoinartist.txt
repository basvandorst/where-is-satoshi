You would need to have the exact same compilation environment to produce the exact same APK. The best way to do this is to use a static build environment, for example in Docker.
See the instructions for verifying Signal APK builds: 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:45:36
Is it open-source? Would love to poke around.

You can compile the APK yourself from source code:

I tried a lot of different fee settings. Actually landed on setting them lower than recommended.
@_date: 2018-07-28 10:25:17
I believe this is possible in `bitcoind` but not used by `lnd`. I'm not certain.
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:16:48
Sounds cool. I'll try!
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:07:27

I've already met with Bank Norwegian about this project and will assist them in any way possible.
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:23:25
I'd say it's working quite well according to design at the moment. Of course there are glitches with `lnd`, but that's expected when it's not in widespread use yet.
If there is a way to increase security by limiting the access to bitcoind from lnd, I would definitely welcome that. I know LukeJr is working on a patch to limit which RPC commands can be run remotely.
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:05:33
If you can get `lnd` running with default settings it's not **that** hard. You need to run some terminal commands, but it's manageable and there are plenty of people who will help you.
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:17:31
I was using the CLI for most of my activities. I tried other wallets when lnd was not working.
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:52:45
I haven't tried any of those yet. I tried Eclair, lnd, Zap
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:16:36

I'm glad that the BTC/BCH fork happened. The cold war was brutal. I would prefer we just agreed (not necessarily S2X), but I cannot change the past. Perhaps this is how opinions will be voiced in the future... by forking?
My hope is that technology, like Drivechains, will give us the tools to re-unite/fuse the chains.

Sure. I can post all the channel details. Keep in mind that I do the experiment days or weeks before it's published.

How did you reach this conclusion? I've been running full nodes, dozens of them, since 2011. How do you think we handle deposit and withdrawals at exchanges? (I've worked at several)
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:15:43
I believe payments would just route through other nodes, like in any peer-to-peer network.

Never heard of the site before. How long have you used it?
@_date: 2018-07-22 04:25:06
Nodes would use other paths to route payments. That's the purpose of a peer-to-peer network.
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:53:31
I believe so. My friend Felix Weis told me it would fix some current LN issues.

Thanks! IOTA was extremely painful to use. It took forever to write the review.


I was displeased with the skyrocketing fees at the time and put it there to poke fun at the declining utility of BTC at the time. I think the whole "ranking" ended up as too much of a joke that I just removed the whole thing.
I'm considering adding a new ranking, but I want to base it on facts, as opposed to whims, jokes, and memes.

For a startup, yes. By the time the regulators scramble to threaten you with fines (which takes years), your startup is either out of business or doing so well you can afford to hire one of these revolving door regulatory consultants like Lawsky to get you off the hook or settle cheaply.
This approach saves both time and money with no downside.

This is incorrect. Bitcoin has been regulated to be illegal in a large number of countries: 
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:16:50


Clearly you've not heard of the mess that is the BitLicense. The community engaged with Lawsky and was rewarded with crippling regulation. Lawsky immediately resigned to start a consulting company specializing in compliance with BitLicense.
Engaging with these regulators is participating in their revolving door corruption schemes.
