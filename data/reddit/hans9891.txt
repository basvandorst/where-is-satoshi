A POW system with a suitable monetary system is great as store of value,  gold like coin. 
BTC can work as a store of value with small amount of transactions and the right miner fees. 
When you use BTC you will do it in such amounts when the fees will be ok for you,  and significant enough for the miners. 
I think that's where BTC is heading.  
Could you see such scenario?

4 weeks is a long time :)


Will be kind and explain the logic? Lets say half of the world HODL BTC,  will then they start spending BTC?  At what point of ppl HODLing will they start using BTC instead of FIAT?  What will be the trigger?  
Why is the amount of ppl HODLing will make a difference? The individual will prefer using USD until he will think it is cheaper to use BTC. 
I hope I am wrong I truly am. But your point is just wishful thinking.
And you might be along long time in BTC, but is shouldn't make you pre minded.  Not all is perfect with BTC and the community needs to be able to talk about the issues in order for them to be fixed and improved.

I agree,  gresham talked about something else.  But there is a similarity to btc vs usd . I remember dell accepted btc for a while and after a year they said no one used btc to buy computers.  
It could be this hole HODL idea that comes from us knowing btc will be rare as f*** having only 21M in the world.
You would want a smarter money supply like Ryo maybe.

Bitcoin is at least as for now the most decenterelized coin.  And it was the first.  I have no doubt it is here to stay.  The question I ask is how will we get to the place btc has promised us a world with now Banks.  P2P economic . I think we need as a community to always keep searching for that goal. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 10:03:28
I think that there are already enough scalability solutions.  The question is more economic and less technical , when we want to disrupt fiat. 
Don't you think? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 06:16:20
The 1% or less of people with 1 BTC or more will might use some to buy yachts and what ever.  
But if Gresham's law can somehow work here comparing BTC to USD,  then it will be the other way around. Like I explained you would always prefer to use your not so good money that loses it's value (the usd) and to keep your better money that is rare and better to hodl (gold/btc). It is not all bad there is value in it for btc early adopters. There is always a chance that the FIAT system will have a crises and for a while people will use btc/gold/food like we see in Venezuela out Iran.  But the moment that will have a cheaper option like another FIAT or better crypto to be a medium of exchange.  They will use it. 
Gresham talked about a situation when there is 2 coins in the market of 1 usd but one of them is from bronze and the other from Silver. At some point you will only see the bronze ones in circulation,  and the people will hold on the silver coins . BTC is from gold/silver usd is the bronze in our story.

I am not sure you got it. 
I am in BTC for a long time and I believe in it. 
But the amount of money in bitcoin can't be the issue for it not being a medium of exchange.
The question why would anyone use bitcoin to buy stuff when he got a cheaper way to buy stuff.  And it is better for him to HODL his bitcoins. 
The point of this medium is that Bitcoin will always be unstable comparing to usd.  It will always gain value comparing to usd. The issue is not the amount of money inside BTC.  If it was the issue then what is this amount? 
It is basic stuff. Much harder to get fooled if you have little bit if understanding.

This guy thinks LN is a waste of time. 
He might has a point… 
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:31:25
I agree it is the store of value of our time. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:16:43
I agree that btc changed everything.  But when I got into it a few years back after a conversation with a bartender in Berlin . I was sure it will take over and will be the global money and a great medium of exchange 
Now I am not sure it is built to do that. Economically it is not a good medium of exchange.
Maybe Ryo or another project could be the medium of exchange while btc is the store of value. 
What do you think about it? 
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:46:10
This guy got it… 
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:27:12
I think ETF might push bitcoin price up,  but it will not help it as far as being a medium of exchange. 
An ETF will make bitcoin gold 2.0.
What do you think? 
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:59:53
What is needed in order to get there? 
And is it true there will be no limits? 
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:19:33
Thanks you are great,  one more question and I am done. 
Is there a time line regarding LN , what is the current situation ? 
@_date: 2018-07-29 06:59:01
I agree btc is a great store of value but not as good medium of exchange. 
I am not spending btc it is to painful when do *10.
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:20:36
Exactly and some projects are not maid by countries,  and could have an impact. 
Like zcash, or Ryo…

Bitcoin is the best reserve currency ��. A perfect store of value.  The Revolution of decentralization needs a new decentralized coin Suits to be a medium of exchange ��.
 
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:44:43
I wonder if pow is the right way to go.  I can see it works for a store of value like gold maybe. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:19:00
The only thing that is matter is decentralization, if its centralized its not part of the revolution.
don't you think a coin that would replace FIAT should have similarity to it? I  mean with the way debt works and money supply?  
@_date: 2018-07-28 06:52:43
There are many reasons for this conclusion,  I am not the one to conclude it so.  
However the main reasons are. 
Ppl will always prefer to HODL bitcoin rather then use it as a medium of exchange ��. 
The main thing banks do today is to make money/debt which help us spent money �� and stimulate the economy. With a fixed amount of money �� you can't have stocks, economic growth or any thing like the modern economy.  Before humans came to america ���� they thought �� the economy is zero sum game.  Thats because there is only a fixed amount of gold.  
Only after that the concept of debt and a non zero sum game came up. 
I think we need to see a more smarter money �� supply system to the crypto age.  
Tell me what your thoughts,  could bitcoin replace the USD only with the money �� supply of 21M ? 
How would each economy will look like?

ETF is a way for whales to pump and dump,  bitcoin doesn't care about it. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 19:43:55
I think that's guy also talk about it,  and the debt is hot all bad. Bitcoin is great as a reserved currency �� or as store of value. 
What do you think well happen to the economy if there is no debt?

In order for a decenterelized currency work.  It needs to have a smarter many supply system.  The 21M coin money �� supply of bitcoin are great for a gold2.0 but how could it replace the economy?  To replace the USD? 
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:26:28
 Bitcoin has a naive fixed supply of 21 million coins. 
And I think the most important thing about bitcoin is the decentralization, but it doesn't do it yet as far as being medium of exchange. This is because FIAT money like the dollar(the most common medium if exchange)  is differentiated from Bitcoin in a critical way: there is an intelligent money supply system for the dollar. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:09:14
I agree there are also more issues,  btc is great as a store of value.  But I am not sure he is build to replace the USD.  He did opened the door for others,  which will have to decentralised as well but build as a medium of exchange.
