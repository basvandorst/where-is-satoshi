Any iOS wallets that support the forked coins?
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:42:15
When they sell, the price will tank - you want to sell when the price tanks?
Your second sentence is pure greed I’m sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:18:36
You are actually a fool. Will you hold your bitcoin until your grave?

Why are you so scared of BCH?

Give it to charity but you will not be rewarded for it.

So why does it come up every time someone mentions Dubai?

Cult mentality 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:08:56
This post is literally bashing BCH

Hes not right, ignore him. Islam is perfect and does not need his false analysis

You need an exchange to convert it back into FIAT...

Lack of intelligence? What if you just want to make a profit?
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:45:40
Ok you don’t see the hypocrisy? You are a cult follower mate
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:41:00
Slave labour and worker abuse? Do you mean the US transnational companies?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:25:27

7 transactions per second is good?
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:02:40
They are literally the same thing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:31:11
If you dont understand math please dont be so loud.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:38:40
How does that work? If you withdraw profits and back into BTC then youll have the same amount of BTC anyway?
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:42:09
But then you have to air weeks/months until it goes lower again...if it ever does. 
So it doesn’t make sense right?

What’s sad is how salty you are that someone has more money than you and also a saner opinion than you.
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:01:10
This is why bitcoin will never be mainstream in the near future
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:36:49
Mind your business.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:45:49
That they have given to him. Why are you so salty?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:15:15
So its 100% true that all scammers are indian?
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:43:41
The bank pays, we do not pay. Please stop peddling false information. It’s free for the users
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:04:47
Read the above.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:32:59
They aren't religious lmao, what a racist moron you just exposed yourself to be. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:30:13
You may have to wait months to get gold though. Will breadwallet support gold?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:25:15
Will breadwallet work?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:27:25
So will moving the BTC to breadwallet immediately be ok?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:24:24
You sound very defensive for someone who apparently wasn’t implying anything?
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:24:23
What religion is that piece of cloth asshat?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:25:55
Apparently there's a countdown on a site belonging to the developers
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:57:06
Your idiocy is astounding.
Not only did you delete the word "race" from my quote but you fail to understand that if only a certain race and no other wears or does something as part of their culture, then by association and therefore by definition it is an attack on someone's race to belittle them for that thing.
I can't believe someone so stupid even knows what a bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:14:51
Is racism ok now?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:41:06
A fool and his money are easily parted.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:19:01
Casual racism is ok?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:50:17
Marriam-Webster has a definition for racism which is "racial prejudice or discrimination".
This thread is literally berating a man for his intelligence because of what he wears due to his culture/race.
If you can't understand that I can't help you.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:27:09
Only people of his culture/race wear that.
It is literally a textbook definition of racism. You are stuck in the past with your thinking, and as someone else commented it's a shame people like you are involved with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:26:57
When is the fork day? And do I have until then to buy more bitcoin to get more new alt coin?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:30:08
Swiss rail system, very efficient and modernised.
However Im not sure if this means full bitcoin integration, can you explain OP?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:22:10
So what are you trying to imply with your comment then? Or are you just randomly sharing a life detail with everyone?
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:50:15
When is this HF occurring?
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:00:43
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:38:27
Oh please, stop trying to make bitcoin so inaccessible to the general people
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:25:36
So no one knows the that snapshot was taken?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:38:59
Thank you for the confirmation
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:22:49
What religion is that cloth from?
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:25:40
Why?

Crypto has shown me how easy it is to fool people with graphs they should have learnt to be aware from in 4th grade math
