Mined a single solitary coin when it was worth 6 dollars. Sitting on it. $450 or so a coin right now, sitting pretty.

I think is what the real genius here is the creation of false rumors, potentially by pirate40 himself, in what may be a perfect manipulation of the market. Forums such as this, given the net-centric nature of the BTC, really fuel the fire IMO.

It's fun to speculate on how he is going to make a return isn't it? However, being a fan of "the simple answer usually being the right answer," I think the truth is pretty plain to see. The guy is making off with a butt-load of dough. I sort of hope I am wrong though, even if I am, I doubt he will disclose his methods anyways.

There's speculation that he manipulated the market the other day as to be able to double up coins when they hit bottom. Once the coin raises again, he will be able to then return investments plus the 7% interest handily. Many have probably already read this, but I figured i'd fill in for those who have missed it.
This of course is just speculation. I'm watching intently I know that much.

Mostly on account of facebooks hilarious plummet.

Doesn't it depend on how pirate40 manipulates the market?
@_date: 2012-08-21 19:00:27
Yep, include me in the sell high buy low. I didn't say the theory was flawless, I just said it was a theory. It's not even mine. I can see there being ways that this could work, though, doubling up seems like a huge margin. 20-30% is the best margin i've been capable of, but i'm not pirate40 either and he sure talked a big talk.

He would play the exchange. Sell 1BTC for $14 offloading a huge number of BTC. The BTC market falls because of the influx, then re-buys BTC at $7/8/9 or whatever it fell to. This again drives demand and brings the price of the BTC up. Then he waits the game out again. 
If he controls a large enough number of BTC, he can artificially work the market. That's the theory anyways. It's not mine, though it seems plausible.

I don't believe it. Proof, anyone?

80 on CampbX. 
The time to start buying is coming soon.

I'm happy for you, but do we need these un-boxing posts every time one shows up?
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:03:35
I like you.

Imagine having an asic today.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:26:37
No, unless you have an interest that rewards you in the way that a hobby might, the reward will likely be too low.
gets these questions daily. As the ASICS begin to roll in a meaningful way, the difficulty is going to increase at a pace that it will quickly reduce profitability, even for ASICS. The GPU mining ship has sailed.

I think your dad should take a little responsibility for his own actions.

Nicely played Mr. Ebay Bitcoin Store. 
Seriously though, thanks for opening my eyes to this. I go on their and buy the most obscure things sometimes, but never did I think about coins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:44:09
For the record, i was joking around. You know, in the vain attempt that i might get tipped as proof.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:11:23
Not sure, but that would be sweet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:36:31
Let me be the judge of what I'm better off doing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:11:05
Mostly education. Bitcoin is a hobby for me, not an investment. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:25:16
I've seen the DIY posts bouncing around here and there. Anybody have a good link to a centralized and current information spot for this? I wouldn't mind playing with one of these.

Downvote for funny pictures that have all already been seen on this subreddit.
