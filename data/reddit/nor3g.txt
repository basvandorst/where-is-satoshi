Core devs sabotaged BTCs first mover advantage, its not unusable and bch is good alternative   
Edit: To the dumbshit who downvoted me; thats a TLDW you moron. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:14:19
Takes time to build a list dude. Start by following charlie lee, btc devs, whalepool, newsbtc, coingraph etc..
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:48:57
mate havent you heard? its a store of value now! Where are the people arguing this now that we've dropped 40%? :)    
We're not getting a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:04:20
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:00:12
Well thats his argument. Hes not directly shilling BCH, more dissing BTC. Saying its not usuable as a payment method, and I agree.   
It's just fucking hopeless how were putting all our faith in LN, which NEEDS a blocksize increase to function anyway - so we might as well do it now when we got an actual fucking country adopting it(Japan). But nope, lets not, lets let it become worthless as a payment method so it gets a bad reputation(bad reputation never leaves you -  rule of business). While merchant adoption is falling off a cliff you got lukejr shilling 300kb blocksize on twitter...  
Those devs haven't got a clue about the world of business. If BTC was barely useable no other crypto would have the possibility to surpass it, now theres a big possibility. We don't even have  tx volume anymore. It's ridiculous how bad its gotten.     
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:44:42
well, he has a point.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:10:28
explain the difference
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:47:21
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:37:09
Miners don't want segwit. They don't want off-chain scaling. 2MB isn't enough to properly scale the network anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:57:12
Well thats a dumb statement. If this is the attitude of the bitcoin 'elite' then no wonder its going to shit.  Poor people is like 90% of potential users. Charlie and Core really lack ambition. Its a shame. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:15:43
They need it more than we do...
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:29:54
Yeah, thats going to work out just great
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:25:02
People with your attitude is why bitcoin is going to plummet in value and eventually die off
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:26:46
Core chain will be unusuable and it will be under attack from BU miners so I doubt it will survive for long 
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:47:46
Except its not going to happen anytime soon
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:47:14
In a reasonable world this is what would happen, and it would have happened a long time ago.  
Unfortunately we got spoiled nerds with too much pride incapable of compromise on both sides, degrading it into a political debate when it should've been a technical one. The entire thing is ridiculous
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:08:54
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:49:46
An act of desperation by Core to keep their chain up and going after BU forks. They know they will lose all the hashrate when it splits and it will leave their chain dead in the water. This is the only option for them. And IMO it wont work.
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:43:36
Honestly it seems very likely to happen this year. BU is at ~30% already and segwit has been stuck for ages. If F2pool decides to support BU we will fork very soon after.
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:01:38
Yeah and then the value decreases to a fifth of what they invested. PR disaster for any government
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:45:50
i use localbitcoin although its a little more expensive. requires no id and is really fast with the right seller*
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:53:08
shit like this is bound to happen when the price skyrockets like that. just be patient and wait, hopefully it bounces back
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:45:37
More expensive than my bank...for international transfers. Id say thats pretty high
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:39:58
I hope you can afford to lose that. Btc might be half the value next week. To answer your question, localbitcoin is faster and easier imo, but more expensive. At least here
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:26:16
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:40:51
who knows? wait 12ish hours and see if the chinese dump again

Lol step out of your echo-chamber

no cus fees
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:57:34
keep telling yourself that
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:27:25
Yes Id like to see that too. Ive seen it running on ltc testnet but nothing more.
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:08:44
Image being able to pay with the same currency instantly in any part of the world with a super low fee... no need to deal with high conversion rates and fees from changing your money to a different currency...
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:53:10
IOTA isnt decentralized and its premined...Bitcoin is the only well distributed, decentralized and reliable cryptocurrency. I don't understand why you people are so unable to see the potential here
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:01:35
Listen, the problem is everyone looking at Bitcoin as a store of value. This is only because Bitcoin has been made useless from a lack of blocksize increases, but this is not what Bitcoin was designed to be. 
LN and stuff is all good - but that stuff takes time, and while we're waiting for it increasing the blocksize won't hurt us. Not doing it hurts adoption. If we had a few blocksize increases by now, then yes maybe we could've bought coffee, maybe not. But at least we could use it to buy stuff.      
What we really need is a clear scaling plan from Core, but we're not getting it and so we are fucked. I think people should make this more of an issue and confront Core, not make a shitty altcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-22 18:37:12
we're a looooooong way from that. the comments in the thread is proof of that...
@_date: 2017-04-24 22:33:55
Its not. Its just a different faction. Kinda like the donald v politics on reddit. They both do and say retarded stuff.
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:50:26
yo guys -- where do you buy plane tickets with btc ? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:00:36
Where did you buy it? Im feeling like a vacation 
@_date: 2019-01-26 19:47:01
We are capitalist not socialist wtf
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:51:46
who are they? or are you just joking?
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:40:30
/b/     
anons were going crazy because their magical internet money was worth $30
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:31:12
I thought they only accepted btc for hotels?
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:22:58
I bought at 1100 in january, like half a week later it was 800.   
Felt like an idiot then, not so much now.  
Just hodl and you will be fine. :)
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:41:45
Any scandinavians here know where i can buy a new pc for btc?
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:08:58
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:40:44
Alright, thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:08:03
So fucking fork it and gtfo. Who stops you?  
Change the PoW and its no longer Bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't Core or any other group. Bitcoin is the Bitcoin which has majority community support - a PoW fork does NOT have majority community support. Not even in the slightest.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:20:48
Jesus man I'm just saying that centralization will happen to some degree on any SUCCESSFUL and mainstream coin. Doesn't matter what algo it uses. The solution is low cost ASICs not changing algo every 6 months. Using vertcoin as an example is pointless. Its a tiny shitcoin with no real interest.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:56:12
No idea about the technicals but that sounds very unpractical if not impossible. I don't know. If you have any literature feel free to link, I'd love to read.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:14:44
Because rich people would just buy a shitton of GPUs instead of ASICs and run them on free power in China?  
How much is 1 ASIC today, 1500$? Anyone with a job can afford that. ASIC resistant doesn't exist anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:28:57
yeah and it has had ASICs for years now
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:30:41
If you change the PoW its not Bitcoin anymore. You'd literally remove it from the mainstream and barry would have full control. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:57:39
Can't compare Bitcoin and Vertcoin...its like $96 BILLION difference. Vertcoin is nothing yet
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:44:04
yeah and you'd have no real money in your ecosystem
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:34:51
Do you know where I can read more about this?
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:25:53
Tagged as irrational fanboy (how do i tag people?)
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:23:12
yeah just like scrypt right
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:31:35
You'd have to change it every 6 months. Any popular coin would get ASICs developed for it. I don't see any such coin gaining popularity as a store of value requires stability for investors, but thats just a personal opinion.  
The best would be 1 cpu 1 vote obviously but i don't know if thats possible...just trying to be realistic here
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:24:32
We just needed an excuse for a correction. We were way overstretched for 'natural' growth. Now we can reset and make new highs in a healthy way. :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:58:10
I wonder what the hell is going on in that guys head..
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:33:58
lol 90 people ? such interest
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:36:38
Well you can't blame them can you
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:25:00
It's just doom and gloom because ethereum is bubbling and bitcoin is not. People are emotional and taking whatever side is 'winning'. When Bitcoin has a shitload of FUD surrounding it it's usually the best time to buy.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:45:58
Or you know, the high fees is making their business worse. Stop with this shit already. Its not a conspiracy, its business. Bitcoin is slowly becoming mainstream. Its make or break time and Bitpay knows it so theyre looking for a solution because segwit is not happening anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:34:59
Just dont be even more of an idiot and sell when it eventually crashes.. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 04:43:51
This post and its comments is like iq 10 wtf happened
