The mining difficulty can go down...

DNS is not really decentralized. Users would have to trust the registrars.

I think the difficulty is calculated every two weeks so that the time to mine a block is always 10 minutes.

The whitelist is actually a good thing, it promotes non-annoying ads. Adblock plus makes it very easy to disable the whitelist.

There's a gif on the front page? We must be at a low point.

This looks interesting, where can I get some dogecoins?

Cool contest! Just remember guys, google makes 95% of it's revenue by leaning everything there is to know about you. Maybe install replicant or something like that on your phone.

The time to decide is now banks, will you be Blockbuster, or Netflix?

About a year ago someone posted something like this. It had an AMA from Satoshi Nakamoto. I guess we all have learned since then. :)

But... But... Wired told me Bitcoins were done for years ago!
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:53:43
That's a pretty funny video. I think it would be cool if someone did a 1984 spoof. As an Apple fan though, I have felt so awkward this week. ;)

A dead tree that tells you how to think. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 20:47:02
Is this like for bitcoin?

"allows small snippets of text to accompany user transactions"
Since when?

How can it be p2p if there is an operator?

TO THE EARTH!

Thanks Friend!

Your paycheck isn't worth the same. USD is losing its purchasing power over time. It's called "inflation". Stop looking at the value of bitcoin only as bitcoin -&gt; USD. The price of USD to euro is going down. Are you worried about our paycheck now?

Wired should be posting another Bitcoin eulogy right about now...

This explains it well.

People need to understand that Bitcoin has a function and is not just an investing fad. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:56:47
What are you, some kind of wizard?
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:16:04
Your a fool and need to consult you're dictionary. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:01:02
The VPN provider can see every site you go to. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:29:19
I'm not talking about mining. The "function" is that Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning that only you have control over your money. There is no other currency that can do this. That is why people like Bitcoin, not because it's some random E-money toy whose value is going "To the moon", but because you have complete control over your account. Bitcoin wallets cannot be frozen, and no one can take your money without your private key. It's like saying that cell phones are just a fad. The only reason people have them is because their friends have them, and in one year people will be going back to wall phones.

Well it looked like one until I figured out reddit doesn't have linebreaks...
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:44:51
On mobile, can't link. I'll draw a wizard instead.

This way my reaction to seeing a gif on /r/bitcoin
