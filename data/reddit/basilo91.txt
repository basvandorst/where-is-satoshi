I’m going crazy haha, I don’t know the first thing about bitcoin either just that I remember buying it once when I was younger and not using all of it. Even if I have one coin I would be happy

I wish I didn’t, or at least didn’t hear it was worth anything. It wasn’t some savvy investing or anything just wasteful spending as a teenager that could be a life changer now if I could figure out how to find it lol

Thanks for the help, what’s the point of holding and not selling? Didn’t buy it as an investment, bought maybe $25 or $30 worth used a little and never really even thought twice about it until I just heard how much it’s worth now while watching a video on YouTube

No I didn’t at the time I had no idea it was gonna be worth more than what I bought it for, didn’t even know the price fluctuated. I think this is just gonna be a very frustrating loss. I just vaguely remember it was some site that said pay with bitcoin or PayPal, hit bitcoin and got redirected to where I bought it. Went to blockchain and trying to locate whatever wallet i might have had, I’m trying to remember old email addresses and passwords I haven’t used in years just trying to find anything lol

I know nothing about it, like is it linked to your email or what. I’m looking for basics like how I even go about accessing it

If I’m being honest, I’m getting the fuck out of here and counting my losses Getting crazy emails now with my passwords and shit
