He has more game than anyone. HE should be the "Most interesting man in the world" in the commercials.

True, because nobody could possibly know anything without being on Reddit. I mean, that whole work experience thing is irrelevant, I mean until the last three weeks. Can't wait to see how much they will pay me know that I have been on Reddit.

Pay off your debt. It is the only way for a guaranteed 17% return. Beyond that, you have bigger problems than this whole Bitcoin thing, which as you can see has unraveled. 
Even if it DOES bounce again, the reality is that the market will need several months of consolidation and stability for people to jump back in. However, those people in the general public that pushed the price up because they didn't know any better??? They aren't coming back.
A true trader takes the higher probability trade. In your case, its clearing debt.

I don't care about Bitcoin, I'm just here to watch Grandpa get it on.

True, because nobody will ever use YouTube again.

The market seems to disagree lately. And in the end, that's all that matters.

I did in the futures markets at just under 19k. The only crypto trade I ever made. The mistake was collecting profits too early. I should have held til expiration. Still kicking myself over that one.

I can promise you there are very few people that are still in it from ten cents. lol
And price is what matters. Nothing else.

I am a technical analyst for crypto and Forex, so I look at these charts daily. I will say one thing:
Bitcoin looks fucking horrible. I mean there is nothing on this chart that even remotely suggests that we are ready to turn things around. I think we go another few thousand lower. To be honest, I am surprised that the support at $6000 held out. There is a bit of a zone of support to the $5000 level where I would expect some bit of a relief rally, but I would be a seller on any bounce.
I wouldn't be at all surprised to see this thing drop to $1,000 by the time its all said and done - maybe less.
This move has been the classic example of a bubble. I remember being told how I didn't fucking understand anything when I told people to get the fuck out at 17k. Those same people told me I was suicidal when I shorted a futures contract at roughly 19k. (Why did I only sell ONE???? Damn money management. Murphy's Law dictates that BTC would be at 50k had I shorted a couple of contracts. For what its worth - the only trade I ever took in this field.) 
I heard an old man talking about this great new thing called Bitcoin in a Bob Evans literally weeks before it fell apart. Idiots were mortgaging houses to buy more. CNBC (The great destroyer of all things personal wealth) started posting the BTC price all over the screens. It was a CLASSIC bubble. Those of us that traded and worked in the field during 2008 had seen it before. History doesn't repeat, but it tends to rhyme. 
The reason I am so bearish - not only the charts - but the fact that there is still a TON of chatter from the so-called "dumb money" out there about crypto in general. Until they capitulate - I from the constant job offers I get they haven't - this thing will struggle. 
Also, institutions have been involved for a while now. This is something that you won't expect: THEY DON'T LIKE 20% GAINS EVERYDAY. Why? Well, look at the chart and you can see why. It NEVER ends well. The more liquidity, the more 'stable' this thing becomes. Ironically, the 'stability' is what will drive the average person away. 
Crypto, if it survives in any meaningful way, is going to become more like precious metals. Ironic considering how the only time I have term "old bugs" came from crypto kids. Karma I guess.

This is completely 100 percent correct. Think of it this way: I spend 20 hours building a crappy shed for the backyard. I decide to build another one and sell it for $500.
However, nobody wants my shed. Therefore it isn't worth $500, no matter how much labor was put into it. Its worth $0.

You guys, seriously - I would listen to him. If the rest of the world doesn't care about Bitcoin - it won't matter. I know you think you are smarter than everyone else, but the truth is there is a reason Drake is popular. It's not his fucking horrible mumbling, its because there are a lot of idiots that actually like him. If there weren't - music would be much better off. But its not the reality. 
He is also 110% correct about sentiment - we have a long way to go for the complete wash out. Finance is about being in the correct bubble at the correct time. This things time has come and gone.

They are gamblers that can't face the 70% losses yet. Normally.....
However, yes there are true believers.

Possibly the best advice I have ever heard. Ever. On anything.

I remember a few years ago, there were gold ATMs coming out. That was at the top of the bubble. This thing seems to have been bit late for the bubble.

You were totally framed. They should have been clearer.
