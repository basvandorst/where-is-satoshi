Eos.io very cheap. Decent long term option.
Im 95% btc and 5% eos.
You need to fully research it though

It depends if you view bitcoin as shares to invest in and sit on for years. Or if you see it as a replacement currency to buy, and you know, spend and make use of it

Coinbase add a premium they charge you.
Use gdax as you can see in my screenshot. It's much more reliable and more the standard tool to use when marking of 10k milestones etc

Honestly, i would life my life in fear of a bullet in my head for that kind of money mistakenly appearing.

I bought a fair few bitcoins less than a year ago at the ATH of £640 per, its now £14,650 per, less than a year later. People laughed at me then for buying at the ATH... however i have since sold enough to pay off my mortgage and 2 cars and ensure the kids have an easy life through college.
Good on OP, when its 50k per in a year he will be laughing

Im looking into moving my BTC to samourai wallet from mycelium on android.
However its saying the cost to move it all will be a £55 transaction fee, will this lower if i wait, or is their a time of day its cheaper?
I understand if my BTC is in Samourai, as its a segwit wallet any fees to move it will be much cheaper once my coins are there right?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:38:12
Not yet. A lot of btc to sell before 10k.

Just buy one off eBay. Here in the UK one coin will set you back £12000 though. Maybe Amazon has them on discount?

Not a keylogger. Honest.
If your for real why are you posting up a wallet worth $6,000,000?
Pay a professional to try data recovery
