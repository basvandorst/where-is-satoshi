So I grew up in witness relocation. My dad was the reason you need a license to broker gold bullion. He moved money across borders and handled the books for some well known "grocers" in South America. My dad since passed almost 2 decades ago. The relevant parties are dead, retired, or in jail. I didn't know the names until after his death. We conveniently ran a moving business. He would tell me to go inside while he starts the car. I had an excellent understanding of life insurance, trusts, proxy votes by age 8. He started explaining when I was 5. I knew where the back up identifitacion was. I wasn't allowed to go outside and play and had to reach out to the world with a modem. You absolutely can move large amounts of money with gold. Recently $400m worth of gold was stolen while being delivered to Venezuela from Guyana. It's getting sold to somebody.

When people are taking a vig it's kind like slavery. They are taking your energy. The energy you spent to get that worthless paper you believe has value. When they lend 6x or 10x, or in the case of Wachovia 97x the reserves and charge intrest that's fabricated money. Debt is a form of enslavement.  Bond is the root of Bondage. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 04:31:33

FTFt CFPB:
Consumer advisory: CURRENCIES and what you should know about them
By: me
You may have heard about currencies like Dollar, Euro, and Yen. But what are currencies? What’s this “quantitative easing!” business on the internet about? And, as a consumer, what risks should you be aware of?
While currencies offer the potential for innovation, a lot of big issues have yet to be resolved – some of which are critical, including:
•	currencies are targets for bankers who have been able to create sophisticated financial systems in order to steal funds
•	currencies can cost consumers more to use devaluation and inflation rate issues into consideration
•	Banksters are taking advantage of the hype surrounding currencies to cheat people with fake opportunities
•	If you trust a company to hold your currencies and something goes wrong, that company may not offer you the kind of help you expect from your bank or debit or credit card provider, because FDIC is grossly underfunded
You won’t hear about our consumer advisory for more things that you should think about if you’re considering using currencies and housing them in banks.

Maybe. So far it's been a good social experiment. Mining isn't worth it. The best thing happened to me was finding some coin left from my farm I built in 2014 and selling Dec 17. Largely market manipulation and shit coins. I mean oppenheimer alone trades more than all of crypto combined. A lot of problems in the last 7 years haven't been addressed. There's not enough volume and interest. Transaction fees have been shit. Is like it to go somewhere but... It's the same circle jerk. 99% of the assessments and claims are total shit. Most people are technophobes. Stigmas and scams ain't helping. If we started taking value and had individual crypto coupons, then yeah I'm all about it.

Mine was a fed wire. He's the thing about an ACH. Anything over 2,500 violates NACHA rules and can be revoked by your bank easily for 3-6 months. In some cases up to a year. No questions. Just because of the amount. They hate crypto and will revoke just for that. Talk to your bank.

Dude I'm not religious or on the left or right. Let's not make this about religion or politics (basically religions of hate). 
I'm just 1 guy trying to help others. I can afford it and do so without mandate because I have compassion. The act of giving is rewarding to me. 
He wanted to find a way to repay me, I told him to help other people. 
Right now he basically does QA for me and questions my code, which is useful. The education and experience is greater than what I pay, which is greater than what he was making on his own. 
You can help people just because you want to. It doesn't have to be about virtue signaling, ad revenue on YouTube, or anything other than you helped someone. I share these stories cause I hope it inspires others. Upvotes and gold on Reddit are meaningless. If we all just helped someone, the world would be a better place and we wouldn't be divided by stupid ideas like religion, politics, and invisibility boundaries.

My sister married a Venezuelan. Things are very dire. My brother in law's cousin was murdered, shot in the back when he asked if he could cross a road block to return home. I send crypto to a friend I made there via r/vzla. I ask for photos of receipts and pictures of people getting food he buys. I sent money because of the video of people jumping into the fire to get food. This kid felt guilty disbursing food to his family. I told him they are in the group that needs help. I don't care who feed just feed people. Maybe it's the Italian me. It's not much but for about $13 I feed a family of 3-4 for a week. I spend that on lunch. 
He dropped out of school and tried doing things on fiver, some slave wage sub on Reddit, farmed resources in games where he had to put up a deposit to work. He was taking programming class and is a sharp kid but had to drop out to work online for 12hrs a day. Good written English. I started paying him to learn. $10/day. He's learning GoLang. Wanted to do front end web dev, I started teaching him the back end with go, redis, postgresql, and Linux basics. He's trying to get job teaching English remotely for $5/hr. I bought him a UPS to help save his computer from the daily black outs. The hard drive and PSU won't take that well especially if there's surges from the restoration and he can't afford to fix it.
When we were talking about disbursing the food, a real concern was publishing the evidence he was sending me. We keep it in a Google drive. The local military have made examples, there are local who are jealous. Your $20 would go a long way, but it could also get them killed by publishing your video. Much like the fascists killing and abusing the HK protestors and those providing first aid.
It's not as black and white as you think. Escape is difficult. I can't afford to help as much as I want to, but I've sent maybe about $3k so far. When I get my bonus in February I'll send a few grand to help his family and those in his community.
I'd love to help his family escape, but where? Many South American countries are plagued with criminals exported from Venezuela because there's nothing to steal. They treat them like the Europeans treat the Syrian refugees. The soccer games with other countries have opposing fans chanting a derogatory phrase that loosely translates to: the poor and starving to death.
Things are not as simple as you make them out to be. Hard life to them is better than death. A simple choice for you had different consequences for them. 
I've done for others in an experiment to see how they spend the money I've sent. They're also proud and do not wish to ask for help and only do so out off desperation. I've bought toilet paper, tampons and other basic hygiene products for a doctor. A fucking doctor can't afford basic shit. Let that sink in.
Edit: holy shit! Thanks for the gold!

I disagree on anonymity. It would make it difficult, but realistically the transparency of the block chain being a ledger does leave a clear evidence trail and if the payment address is consistent, she could see how much you spent on web whores instead of her. It's better than a cc though... Until she's like why the fuck did you buy so many bitcoins at some exchange, how many do we have, blah blah blah. I think it's good because fuck high risk processing rates.

I just meant your comments about Jesus and communism. I oppose all authoritarianism, and reject religion. I'm not 100% in agreement with your stance, but we agree enough I'm not going to nitpick. Have a good weekend.

Yeah could be good, could be bad. It's a lot easier to track what they can tax on a block chain. The best way to buy hookers and drugs is with cash.

TL;DR: Free markets assess the value. Valuation != value. 
disclaimer: I'm a long-winded idiot.
diatribe: Value is subjective. For example, my engineer has to take a pill every 4 hours to break down the adrenaline his body is over producing because of condition he is currently suffering or he will die. The pill costs 1.65/pill which is it's valuation, but the value is his life. That pill has no value to me other than it keeps my friend and colleague alive. I don't need to take it. I don't know of an opportunity where I can broker it for trade. If we stop using someone else's valuation and use our own value system for our needs and desires, things would change drastically. 
With traditional fiat, and crypto, you have a few people hoarding the printers (miners). The bankers have a license to counterfeit and have the added bonus of influencing our valuation. So we are taxed with inflation and we are double taxed as we are devalued. With crypto, you have people hoarding the miners, extracting more than they produce in many cases, and speculating value. There is no value other than a bet in an exchange to attempt to extract perceived value from the other gamblers. What is the real value of bitcoin? X dollars? what is the value of those dollars? a triangulated value with other printed bullshit?  It's a race to the fucking bottom with countries devaluing their currency to gain trade...this seems stupid to me. 
I had this idea a while ago for a crypto coupon decentralized exchange, but considering the flaws in crypto I'm not sure I want to use blockchain tech for this any more. So let's just call it a coupon for now. I differentiate money from currency from coupons. This is my belief: Money is a tangible asset in trade for goods and service that we BELIEVE has value, like gold etc. Currency until bitcoin was a celebration of dead presidents, art printed by criminals, we BELIEVE has value. Coupons are a token in trade for a fixed value we know we're going to receive. like groupon. 
I can instantiate a coupon for any good or service I can deliver. So I create a block of jpastore coupons that can be traded for one hour of my time or a unit of my harvest, or unit of a product I make. You can buy these coupons from my exchange node with any of the other listed symbols I have a buy order in for. I planned on introducing a stablizer that employees something akin to triangulate arbitrage....look for what I want and try to find the cheapest deal for me...commodity+logistics. I need wheat, water, etc. I should be able to interface with my contacts exchange nodes and the public markets to try and determine the most efficient means to settle. This may require satisfying other people's needs, (automated collaboration), to ensure delivery of my needs at the lowest cost possible.
I don't like a controlled centralized market that can be manipulated, like Best Buy's internal web page with fake data to support their prices or the bankers manipulating the LIBOR. Quite frankly every single person should be a middle man and direct producer without and special permission. If you have a reputation and there is 3rd party assurance we should be able to transact. There should be a double deposit system for trustless transactions, like that found in real estate. I think David Zimbeck brilliantly introduced into his Halo system for bitcoin and blackcoin. disclaimer: I briefly worked with him on this, and paths diverged shortly thereafter.
The gamble should only be an event of unplanned catastrophe such as a hurricane, earth quakes, or some highway robber/customs/tax man or other cartel trying to intervene until they are made irrelevant. 
Security for delivery should also be compensated for as a service, which could be argued to be the tax for protection we pay the mafia, I mean government.  In fact everyone can organize all services needed without centralized government. Property ownership is something I'm still working out. Like actual land and claim to it. 
This is kind of a digression into another diatribe...if you're still reading...thank you. 
I have an idea on how to start the implementation of this with education. I envision a university owned as a co-op with the community that hosts it, the faculty, and students. Students can come together and create an actual business, product, or service. Your core idea producer can engineer a widget, or recruit an engineer to design the widget. Their respective professors can take a stake in the project and collaborate with other departments to try and actually launch it. I think this bridges a gap between academia and enterprise. This needs work for the research sectors of academia.  I think parents should instantiate a wallet/contract with their children, their teachers should have a stake in the children. Long term low yield contracts for the elementary teachers, slightly higher stake for middle school, even higher for the high school. The university is honing the foundational skills and deploying a functional person or group. Everyone has a stake in the future success of the children. The contract would expire after a maturation period. People should not be a slave to society, but society should recoup the something from your success. In my opinion this differs from socialism as it is not compelled, and people are incentivized to collaborate instead of compete. If we collaborate to keep costs down we won't have hoarding psychopaths convincing us that we need to give them our wealth for the artificial restriction they created and bully us with. The idea is to grow independent self sufficient micro economies with need for a king/central authority which is invariably the problem.
I tried to keep this short and simple. sorry. I think there is much more to describe but I already dragged you down a rabbit hole and I'm surprised if you made it this far. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 01:44:38
But it seems to just change the player and owners of the problems. It's a great proof of concept, but still an exchange traded and manipulated system. I personally believe we should trade value instead of a manipulated belief.

I don't know why this is something we should consent to it ask permission for quite frankly. It's s decentralized currency to be related by a central authority? Defeats the purpose.

Maybe because those interested in bitcoin (which ironically auto corrected to bitching) are not interested in sports.  Obviously they are not mutually exclusive, but geeks aren't known for their sorts enthusiasm.  But the observations about mtgox and conversion rates are excellent points as well.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:58:24
No that they paid a small vig to make a shit ton and we need decentralized free trade, cause fuck these banks. Yes it can be manipulated and maybe Bitcoin isn't the best answer, but we need something that doesn't Hoover away our wealth.

Charged with them at the conference in Vegas.
