That's interesting.  I can definitely see that happening. Wouldn't the silver and gold level coins be volatile though, regardless of no inflation, due to large volumes of trading, given that trading would be easily accessible to the masses on their devices?

Right. Exactly. Bitcoin is revolutionary and “for the people”....but not in any way intrinsically Socialist.

Hard fork.

If their plan was to pump and dump then Wall
Street would be talking about Bitcoin  in glowing terms to get people to buy, driving the price up. I don’t see that happening. Instead, I’ve seen lots of FUD spreading from Wall St. talking heads and the mainstream media. I’ve also seen or read interviews with luminaries like Dimon, Bloomberg, Blankfein, Buffet... all of whom seem rather clueless about what blockchain actually is. Bloomberg even called it “bitchain”.  IMHO we are at that point where the music industry was at when Napster came on scene. There was a period of time where the big labels thought they could put the genie back in the bottle. They couldn’t, and they had to adapt or die. Wall St is late to the game, they know it, and they are kicking themselves for not getting in sooner.

Yeah...it's something of a paradox. The greater the demand for it, the more the price goes up, and the less likely therefore it is to be used as a day to day currency, which was, of course, the original intent.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:34:46
Absolutely agree. At least BCH is down 30% in the past 24 hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:31:02
Yeah. It's getting annoying. I thought one of the hallmarks of a bubble was that it catches people off guard? If this is  a bubble...it will go down as the most spoken-about-beforehand bubble of all time. I personally don't think it's a bubble...I think it's just that Bitcoin's "brand recognition" has exploded in recent months, driving up demand. Lots of people didn't give a shit about Bitcoin when they thought it was hard to get into. Easy to use trading apps like Coinbase have opened trading up to Joe Schmoe...which is good. It's not a bubble...it's just a huge volume of normal supply and demand driving the price up. A lot of people are probably going to cash out at the next deep dip, when Futures trading begins...which is fine,  because there's plenty more people who will swoop right in and buy, and the price will rise back and beyond where it was before.

Right. That’s sound reasoning actually. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:19:45
Fence sitters hedging their bet by holding both BTC and BCH kind of piss me off. Choose a side, divest from the other, and let’s get this battle over with already!

I’d like to hodl that bottom. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:37:57
OP: Try not to stress about the unrealized gains. Every hour you spend stressing can be thought of as an hour of work for which you’re not getting paid...thereby compounding your losses even more.

Back over 14,300. Price is moving so quick. Got up to get a snack...and it jumped over 1000. Lol.

Ask him if he still thinks "bitcoin is a fraud."  If so, what exactly makes it a fraud? Would he still "fire anyone at his company that trades in bitcoin"?

Lightning Network is going to vastly reduce those fees down to a much more reasonable level. The fees anyway are purely utilitarian in that they go to service the actual upkeep of the infrastructure. Wish the same could be said for my taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:54:56
But who would do such a thing? I mean it’s not like anyone stands to gain anything by doing so...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:38:12
Got in at 5700 two months ago with money I was prepared to lose. Obviously, I'm thrilled so far. Planning on taking my principal out, if / when it hits 20,000. That way it's all gravy as far as I'm concerned. If it bursts, I'll wait for the price to hit bottom , buy more and ride the wave back up. But yeah...I agree with what others have said... the reason I can sleep at night is that I got in only with money I'm prepared to lose.

Peter: "The only reason it's going up is because of demand!"
Robert: "That's how markets work, Peter."
Lol.

It really is a Wild West casino.

90% of people don’t know how fiat works either, or whats in their 401k, etc. I don’t see anything unusual about this.

Yeah, that is nuts. I see that American Express is going to be sending international payments using Ripple now. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:41:02
Thanks..this seems like a really good description of what 7 -10+ years from now is going to look like. In such a scenario I think Bitcoin's place is secure either as a store of value or speculative asset, given that it has such wide brand recognition. It's the Coke of coins. I was imagining a scenario where Bitcoin &amp; Fedcoin would have to battle to the death... glad to hear that probably won't happen.

Agreed. I'm not worried about the hodlers and libertarians. I'm concerned that institutional investors and the average citizen, who wouldn't really find much use in getting away from banks or gov, and wouldn't really need the anonymity either, would leave in droves. The masses are asses afterall, and routinely shoot themselves in the foot and act against their own true best interests.
