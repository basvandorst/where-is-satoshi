Blonde moment. I’m dumb.

@_date: 2019-11-06 18:32:43
So uncivilized.

Can we not do this trump thing here? Seriously.
@_date: 2019-11-18 05:07:10

What’s a delete suite? Sorry for the dumb questions. 
I’m not deleting my account I’m just curious about all of this. I never heard of it before
@_date: 2019-10-15 04:57:07
When you delete an account does it actually go poof? Or is it like Facebook where it’s actually still there forever...

Gotcha. So what’s the point in investing into it on Robinhood? Is it just the potential of the market? I’m sorry for the dumb questions.
Also how do I invest into bitcoin legitimately?

Thank you mom

I’m actually surprised Apple is only charging $999 for it. I was expecting $1200 cause they go up $100 every fucking year. Trash company. Not that $999 is cheap because I’m still not paying that for a fuckin phone lol

This is confusing the hell out of me lol. I need to keep researching before I invest. Thank you for the help

So you don’t actually own any bitcoin. Got it. Essentially the only way in owning bitcoin is through the website which someone else linked. This may be a dumb question but is there an app for bitcoin sort of like Robinhood to invest into it? So I don’t have to use safari to check on things?
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:49:59
~~How much you paying over there? $0.02? Lmfao~~
Edit: wow this sub can’t take a joke. Jeez. Fuck ya’ll lol
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:54:53
So now that bitcoin already had its big boom and people got rich what’s the next big thing to invest in? I need some money ASAP.
@_date: 2019-09-27 16:07:50
Yeah I’m kind of crying instead
@_date: 2019-09-29 22:36:35
@_date: 2019-09-09 23:04:29
Thank you I’ll try it out!
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:18:53
Cause it is
@_date: 2019-09-16 21:15:19
