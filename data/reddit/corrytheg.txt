You simply download the app and join our club. We have group chat on telegram.
You can check the layout out for free, and we actually have a $250 FREEROLL tonight, as we do every Sunday!

Not really unique, we made a club on Pppoker, we take a LOW rake percentage that the app allows (1.5 percent) in hope that more people will side with us. 
  We have a unique auto deposit bot via btc for when we are asleep as well. And group chat via the telegram app.
As for stakes, you can play on a 10/20 cent blind table with $4-$20 or a 20/40 cent blind table with anywhere from $8-$40.
You cannot buyin with more than a certain amount aswell. The higher the stakes the higher the range. For example you can join a table with blinds at 1/2 with anywhere from $40-$200.
We also have enabled our jackpot feature which also comes directly out of any money generated. We have it activated for holdem and PLO, but not PLO5.
We also do small weekly giveaways, and $100gtd freerolls every week.
Any other information needed please let me know!
