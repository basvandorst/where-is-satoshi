You are looking for a thief.  It may be another thief taking advantage of the confusion.  Dismissing a proven thief as suspect is premature.
Also, everyone taking money from that guy, especially when he is openly identifying himself as a thief, is participating in money laundering.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:12:45


of course, and I would further argue that he just acquired dozens of associates.

Customers don't hold any keys. Coins are lent, exchanged and the bitfinex admins move them and mix them as they please (btw: it was the admin account making the withdrawals) it is not the same coins lying in a vault all the time.
Bitfinex acknowledges this by even considering socializing losses across people with Bitcoin balances.
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:30:19
Was there ANYTHING in MTGOX? Also MTGOX had the theft operation going on for longer. Here it seems it was pulled off in one event and we can clearly see how much was moved.
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:52:42
But if you lent BTC you didn't have BTC. Even if the little vault analogy  would work for BTC deposits (which it doesn't but lets say it does) you wouldn't have BTC, you had a debt-note denominated in BTC to the margin borrower.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:21:06
Another angle is that this old hacker is associated with an insider at bitfinex and is pushing the angle that it was a hack.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:29:59
Any movement starting for this? Any law firm where people are converge? Seems like bankruptcy needs to be forced sooner rather than later. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:23:39
Yes, and that there is a different chain with less work does not make it less of a HF. Further, as we've seen recently in an event of which the implications cannot be fully discussed in this subreddit, smaller chains can have supporters.
HFs have many uses and outcomes, many pros and cons, sometimes vastly superior to SFs, sometimes morally hazardous. Intentional HFs being intrinsically bad things is a relatively recent understanding, at least partially politically motivated.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:56:48
How not? Under maaku's proposal the miners would reorganize the txs in a new chain of blocks starting before the hack ("144 blocks back"). If someone keeps mining on the longest chain then you have two chains. 
One might not economically viable but it is as HF as HF gets.

Bitfinex thinks there are bail ins.
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:45:27
Except it was the admin account of Bitfinex doing all the stealing.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:07:46
I understood. I was also being a "smartass": truly, they should have declared it around **now**, instead of pretending that bail ins are not fraud. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:54:58
Which means they are saying BTC is fungible, and thus they are not custodians of a hard individual asset with individual properties but of a currency. Thus they owe that currency to the users and thus they are bankrupt and should liquidate.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:00:59
Sure, you need to flip a bit or two somewhere to say you want the original chain. And even if someone doesn't do that, while you're taking over the original chain and pushing people around, you are still performing a HF even if the end result is that only one branch is used by anyone.

@_date: 2016-08-05 01:00:33
It seems that is not what is being prepared. Sounds like they are preparing a bail in instead of just recognizing that they can't meet their obligations, liquidate and divide by the creditors.

Not all people with BTC accounts could see those BTC, especially if lending. Very often it was a total mess, the coin movements. There was no "car" standing there for a lot of people even if you want to attack fungibility. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:39:52
Because the person borrowing is holding BTC? What about the borrower of BTC? He is holding USD and the lender of that BTC won't have BTC either, he will have a BTC credit that the borrower has to pay back. Thus are BTC shorters and BTC liquidity providers off the hook??

USD, ETH, LTC, the stocks it holds in blockstream, any property, the platform and brand itself (if any worth), any other asset. Bitfinex owes its creditors. If it can't pay then it's bankrupt.

Happens a lot more than you imagine. This emotional attachment to a trade after big wins and similar stuff (across every asset class) because the vast majority of people won't share these lessons, you don't hear about it and once you get big a win you don't recognize the all too common traps. 
Also, maybe it will bring you some comfort that, it may feel like you lost it all when you "were so close" but, in fact, until you really interiorise the lesson, "take the loss", hold those moments when the market seems to be proving you "right" afterall, it doesn't matter so much if you sit on your hands once or twice, there will still be that little last chance of doing that trade (or bet) that would bring you back to the peak some other day to trap you and ruin you again. Human nature has many pitfalls, this is just one, who knows what the future would have been otherwise... maybe something worse could have happened...
Good luck with your future ventures, you are now an hardened badass in some ways that most people will never be! And thanks for sharing!
(ps: some people take all their lives, not 7 months to get over it and see it with perspective the way you do).

Maybe you are trying to say that the money they lend requires a small reserve that still has to come from deposits. Unfortunately not even that is true anymore as you can use your printed debt to buy assets that can be used as reserves in many different ways and even those reserve ratios, in some countries, are 0% since a few years back (such as in the UK).

I agree but I still see potential. Consider the following: what if someone in a third location needs to know, securely and with no other trust other than that the garage door listens to the blockchain and some addresses, and at a later time (lets say one hour after), that the garage door was ordered to be opened in the past? 
This is easy with the assumption that the door listens to the blockchain. I see no way to do it without it. Do you?
Ninja-edit: OK, so no longer quite the use case OP described, maybe the exact "open my garage for the sake of opening" is unrescuable and the one I described is something else and not new. (Similar to Andreas hotel door or Nick Szabo's "smart-property" that Luke posted). Still leaving this here to have more people like OP thinking out loud stuff along these lines. :P

Good perspective. However this 19 euro/second used for bond purchases will be essentially base money and therefore expandable by a few orders of magnitude at the banks themselves. Additionally the 19 base euro per second is just an increment. 
Not to say that the expansion of euro-ponzi supply from this will actually occur anytime soon since there are so many pockets of euro deflation.

The quantity charted is the purchasing power of the dollar. The purchasing power may very well be as simple as 1/CPI but the chart is not CPI. 
The latter distinction is important as one can see from what you wrote above: suggesting that prices went up during the "Great Depression".
edit: removed the useless moral lecturing, also I agree with you that CPI might measure very little other than to indicate that a particular currency is not very good money, you still saw the chart upside down.

You should see if your comment applies to yourself. For you it's all "&gt;tactics" from evil conspirators. You call genuine people with genuine concerns "astroturfing". 
Your comment implies that we can debate certain topics here but  mods are like you and call an incredibly broad range of topics "trolling" and "FUD" and ban people. 
I left to the "other side" long before I was persuaded that what you call "altcoin" was in fact closer to the original bitcoin and that blocking the stream is happening too early. I did so because I was disgusted with the absurdity of some bans here and deletions of very interesting and enlightening discussions.
Now that you figured all out, I will convene with all my other suckpuppet/bot conspirators and change tactics. Perhaps I won't post here again for hinting at forbidden topics and thus being banned (not that I have been lately because I know what happens).

Your post reads like an empty shell of vitriol with some generic accusations and who it targets can be (and probably should be if such vitriol was ever justified) changed very easily.
Further, if you check my post history you will see that I am not "disrupting actual discussions" (seriously?). I am mostly a listener in this topic and like me there are many others who are disgusted at what goes on right here everytime something leaks out and what is said by people like you.

Present censorship at (not counting the amount of bans and manual post deletions) works very much the same way as searching for forbidden terms in mainland china. You search for a while about Tiananmen massacre or other forbidden terms and you get a few results at first. Then things stop loading half way. Then nothing. 
You want to prove to the Chinese that their internet is censored by searching a forbidden term on their computers and it works. Maybe it works for a full day. They call you crazy and trust their overlords. 
The next day some political stuff flares up in Taiwan and you can't find a thing about it online.
It has been months with my posts not showing if I mentioned r/btc/ I would make a fuss about it and it would appear to please trusting people like you. Same thing with the word censorship. I never did mention the following because I'm only really truly pissed at the massive amounts of censorship here but, for the heck of it:

I understand. Has that adding to a list not been happening though? It seems the only way around for a mod. Personally I am not a fan of the main mods in either sub (some good ones in both), perhaps a consequence of the people who are the most emotional about things tending to be the first to act, but it seems like this sub has issues of a much more serious nature.
For example, are we allowed to post a link, here, to the recent medium.com post on that very issue? 
Myself, whenever I post, if I type some particular keywords including the name of the other sub, my comments take a long time to show or never show.

Imagine you are a person with some views and part of a community. Imagine the main place you have been discussing about those views and related topics suddenly starts deleting any posts that promote or hint at your view as well as banning posters holding those views. A new place opens up where that doesn't happen. A small amount of old timers from that community start discussing there but all the newbies still see the old place. 
Wouldn't you expect angry posts to climb in those circumstances?
The thing with splitting communities top down is that resentment builds up very fast on both artificially-split sides because humans have an evolutionary drive to pick teams.

How is it useless? It illustrates perfectly the system and was blacklisted accordingly as my reply to BashCo still is (because it mentions one of the keyword that your automated systems picks up).
That pic means little to me because I'm not a mod. Is that one (1) report? In 12 hours?
Finally, what am I promoting exactly? An end to this absurd c-wording practice that is dividing the community? It is especially destructive when you do it China-firewall like, exactly the way my comment describes.

I agree that there is unnecessary incitement from some people with decent influence in the other sub and that it doesn't help the issues in this sub.
 
However, I was here before the other sub was a thing. The time the "moderation" here felt the worst was a bit over a year ago and it didn't improve terribly much. 
Much of that improvement was simply success of the moderation is killing completely some of the topics and removing a lot of people from the scene. Also, people feel uncomfortable discussing things outside the venues most favorable to their ideas once polarization is successfully enforced.

I agree with this, that is a better parameter to use. 
However, the above argument still holds and implies a 50% correction in both reward and hashrate with the premises considered upon block reward halving. Does it not?
Also notice that the statement I quoted has implications for the consequences of diverting transactions from the main-chain (nothing else considered).

@_date: 2015-08-23 21:21:11
Block rewards drop by 50%. 
Assuming people are not willing to pay much more per transaction as jtoomim argues (and assuming full blocks and tight margins for completeness) then the hashrate drops the least-economic half as measured in terms of electricity costs, which in the big scheme of things and for the sake of argument, jtoomin probably assumed to scale linearly with the hashrate.

Interesting idea!
You could perhaps sign a message associated with your forum account with a Bitcoin address that holds a certain amount. 
The forum checks the "balance" in the address from where the signature came and shows a green ball next to the username if above a certain amount for every single forum read or at the time of posting (or both with indicators).  
You could demand a nlocked address with that ~1 week time.
You could do a lot of things  without the forum having to hold any accounts.

Seems like it will happen if it can happen essentially. If it can happen seems to depend on how centralized mining is in terms of actual physical control of the machines. Pools cannot collude in that way because the small miners will solo or power usually small pools thus keeping the global hashrate in a fully decentralized scenario. Still, may be able to bring some power-saving in the future.

You couldn't prove it is your screenshot. Not saying people do it here but, with Bitcoin, you could sign a message with the private key of some address containing the bitcoins thus proving you control it.
I guess in the bank account you could move it to a bank account that someone in a forum requests you to thus proving you control it. Or some specific amount someone requests you between accounts. Bit cumbersome though and requires interaction.

OP states that they removed it quietly. That means they do not state that the cost of accepting Bitcoin was higher than the Bitcoin income. Am I wrong? Does it state anything else?
Plenty of companies stop accepting Bitcoin. Sometimes even Bitcoin companies when enough banks shut their doors on them.*  
Competitors some times are just a bit better or a bit more motivated to work with whom they need to work. Sometimes it's just the tinyiest technical knowledge.

Careful with getting a company to accept Bitcoin and then not use them. It will be harder to get them to go back to Bitcoin after they drop it due to lack of sales.
Might be better to go out of your way and use alternative companies that already accept Bitcoin. Additionaly, then you have a higher chance of supporting a company led by an ethically minded decision-maker, who will also have a higher chance of re-using that Bitcoin with suppliers instead of just dumping it for their local fiat ASAP.

Right. I understand your frustration. I don't think it is a waste of energy because there is no secure alternative.
I guarantee that my desire for an alternative to PoW is home-brewed. I don't think there is a good alternative (including the present PoS technology) but if there was, it was well tested, and it meant lower energy usage I would embrace it. I also have a desire for it as I am sure others have and express it.
The talk about the fork and implementation of improvements is precisely because some people think it is hard. For me the ledger, the blockchain, the story of Satoshi sent 50btc or whatever to Hal, then some guy sent 10 000 coins (maybe for two pizzas who knows), is the thing to preserve in the most secure and decentralized way possible.

It seems that the paper is promoting an alt with 3 standard PoS parameters tweaked and 1 non chain-specific node code that tries to punish nodes that relay attacks.  
Not necessarily a bad thing but since this is so much more about one alt rather than general PoS, and since one of the points is merely increasing the mining reward, I would suggest putting a graph of the supply over time of your alt in the paper and mention that this is more about an alt when announcing it.
Edit for a disclaimer: I am not PoS expert nor PoS coins or alt coins user. It seems to me that the paper mostly describes a tweaked alt and therefore supply graphs and stuff like that would help non-experts like me.

Something to keep in mind for people doing large face to face trades with random people.

Ah thanks! Mainly risk management. I have a location with the seed written down. It is very safe but if I'm proved wrong then at least I lose only one of the wallets. 
Also I am considering  trusting one of the seeds to a person as a sort of partial will in case of my demise.  For this later case, the current market value of the coins present in my phone would not justify too many divisions of this sort but if I'm dead and the value changes then such division changes in relevance.

In most places Credit Card companies won't work with large Bitcoin selling companies. Even banks will block them. Just to give an example: Safello had a great bank account in the UK that allowed one-day payments to buy Bitcoin. Closed for no reason even though they tick all the regulatory marks, have impeccable reputation, and have the equivalent bank system working perfectly in Sweden for a couple of years now.
It's not just that a particular bank wants to attack bitcoin, it's that banks are depending on things like overnight interbank lending due to the hugely leveraged nature of their business and thus hugely vulnerable to even a few of the other banks simply not lending them money (and thus vulnerable to the tiniest threats from even a few banks that truly want to attack Bitcoin companies).
Your fiat currency is not truly yours, it is hostage to the money transmitters. You have a legacy-money transmission issue. :/
 
Localbitcoins works well in general but not sure what specific options there are in New Zealand. Hope the other suggestions help you. Good luck.

I long for the day when PoS will be a serious contender to PoW. I'll definitely give a read on those 39 pages.
I don't think I will value the entries in "NeuCoin's" ledger though (nothing personal, maybe I will tip the author if I find his contribution valuable).  I will rather value the entries in Bitcoin's blockchain and support a Bitcoin PoS fork.

I'm not entirely sure I understood. Do you mean use another device with Mycellium to generate a new HD wallet and then use an option in my main Mycellium to import that new one and thus have two wallets with the different seeds? Thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-14 11:59:10
Yeah, I don't believe for a second that anyone will be able to patent Bitcoin, but some particular software that enables some particular nice feature/service that a small startup developed? I think that is a risk unfortunately.

Thanks for your awesome list and weekly topic. 
Quick detail for quick reference on SENS: They research following a strategy aimed at reversing aspects of ageing and in the process cure assorted ageing diseases such as Alzheimer (as opposed to other approaches that are more about mitigating the symptoms of such diseases).

If you know about the other room and if you are not an average human (vulnerable to ingroup/outgroup thinking) then you "can GO".

Plenty of legit looking loans turned sour in BTCJam. BTCJam is a dangerous affair and it needed not be: 
 The biggest issue is that if the third party BTCJam sends the info to for arbitration is gone then BTCJam just shuts the door completely to the investor. They seem to have a terrible fear of supporting investors with info once a scam reveals itself.
This was the case with JudgeMe. It will be the case with the present arbiter.

Good point.
A bigger concern is this though:
Most of these big tech companies have whole departments dedicated to developing new stuff to patent and archive. The competition or the open-source World is succeeding with it a few years after? Take it out of the drawer and claim that market for you or sue someone.

Besides everything else people are saying here: be aware that BTCJam will leave you completely helpless once you get scammed.

It was supposed to be like that during the "judgeme" time as well. Then judgeme got out of the picture and now they just don't give out the details. 
That sucks for everyone scammed during the judgeme period and it will suck for everyone starting loans during the net-arb period because there is no reason for net-arb not to walk away the same way judgeme did and no reason for BTCJam not to act in the same shitty way after that.
Frankly, BTCJam seems to have their priorities wrong and there is room in this space to improve over them.
