How have you not blown your brain yet?

How to buy Bitcoin without Coinbase? Or other exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:41:46
I see that you never actually refuted his claims and just attacks
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:37:28
I just don’t understand how all the coins are recovering and breaking ATH but BTC has been a dead fish in water lately. I HODL
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:36:27
The point of this thread is to find more information. If you have a opinion, say it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:35:27
I never said BTC is dead. Just feels manipulated
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:21:57
You think for good or temporary?
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:17:56

@_date: 2017-12-23 15:56:21
If you believe in fantasies 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:34:55
Yes and listen to guy who didn’t jump in at $1k this year. GTFO
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:16:56
Who saids anyone is making light of it? People put their life savings and hope in this
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:08:29
How do I get a withdrawal with bitcoin to USD then?
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:11:28
Where and how do I go get a debit card?
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:30:10
Why wouldn't I want to? I owe my mom money and I don't want the IRS to wonder where all this money came from
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:29:18
Because it's times 3 the volatile
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:03:40
Are the fees high?
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:37:26
People are crazy. There's gold and oil
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:04:40
How about 7k, poor student with no full time history
@_date: 2019-08-10 05:50:49
Explain to me like a child please
@_date: 2019-08-10 07:38:54
So this is bad for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:02:06
A whole bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:51:54
Was trying to make a withdrawal. Check how much I had beforehand. Then $2
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:05:12
Edit: I have done my research, I just wanted to double check
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:00:52
How big of the difference was with Bitcoin Cash value and what Coinbase gave?
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:22:47
Go stuff some ranch dressing in your ass. Dumb ass white knight wanna be
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:13:45
I am a idiot I will definitely lose the piece of paper
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:32:49
That’s bullshit. You had 3 months to buy more but you didn’t. You said your coworkers laugh at you but back in your mind you doubted it too. Otherwise you would have bought more. Worked more or cut back on things. $75 is 7 hours of work for you
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:21:09
I make $8 a hour and I have thousands invested in bitcoin as a college student. So yes I know what the fuck I am saying.
When have I said he sound take out a loan? I am just pointing out that he barely took any risk and can’t be gloating about how he is right and his coworkers are wrong 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:16:53
I sold at 4300
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:58:53
Have you used it before? What’s the catch? How do they make money?
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:27:00
Sod off man, go suck a dick. Like you were a complete gentleman to me too. Go fuck yourself in the ass with ranch dressing
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:57:27
Girl, what are you smoking. I am looking at my comment posts. And I called you out once on this thread before you responded.
You are telling me I should be positive but you are ranting on a public forum that you were right and your coworkers was wrong. 
But the thing is you are disillusioned.Anyone can brag about how their small bet succeeded. You told your friend that you think your $50 has a chance to be $100,000? That’s a 2000 time increase. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:06:55
The thing was my uncle lended me $5000 to learn how to invest. I wanted to pay him back as soon as possible. So that’s why I sold half and gave it back to him
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:16:40
Bitcoin to giftcards
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:44:44
Why? Coinbase say we don’t need to do anything
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:36:44
You are a dumbass, you know. Who said I was female? I have never naysay any other posts about you. Prove it and I will apologize. 
Let’s be honest though you are trying to prove to your friends that you were right but you barely took any risk. You know it. You are just gloating about your little success. 
If Bitcoin went to $0. You would be out $75 dollars. Whoops di doo
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:58:52
What are you 5? I am done wasting my time on trash like you. Have a good day sir with ranch dressing up your ass.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:00:11
You are a god damn genius calling the top
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:59:01
How is it advocating for fraud? Who says it was illegal to trade BTC for gift cards
@_date: 2019-06-01 09:10:24
A+ meme
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:41:10
How would I get the 2x coins if it’s in a private wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:52:50
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:42:44
You are a fucking dumb ass for even remotely think your $50 will be $100,000 one day.
That’s a 2000 x increase from the price of $2500 in Bitcoin. Or a value of $5 million per Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:55:51
You obviously didn’t believe in it. You bought just $75 worth
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:54:12
That’s a good way to avoid capital gain taxes right?
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:44:14
How can it be hacked?
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:39:43
I didn’t say to go all into Bitcoin. I am saying $75 investment in 3 months is nothing to gloat about that he made a small risk. Anyone can do that about penny stocks.
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:17:46
What’s your plan? Just holding? I am getting impatient since 2017
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:39:41
So do you bet a lot or just for fun?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:34:38
How long till back to 4.5k?
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:42:47
At this point, I just think it is funny. So much fear, best time to buy
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:39:41
What do you do?
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:49:59
If they really are your friend, they should accept the lost themselves. Should understand how volatile this shit is.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:53:20
When you accept the bonus you agree that you can only get the money won unless you play. I didn't know that because it is hidden. That's how they make sure to never get your money back.
At one point I was up 12.5k. Lost 2.0k in total and made it out with 10.5k
At another point I when I was at 6k winnings, I was down to $66 dollars but I made it back up to 6k.
And another I was down from 12k to 1.5k but I slowly grind it back up to 11k.
I was playing blackjack against a computer the whole time. I am pretty sure the more you bet, the higher the chance you bust or they having good hands
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:11:54
That's very true
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:29:02
How do you short bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:31:48
How many coins is that?
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:25:27
Bovada, I honestly got lucky. I almost wiped my account twice. Would not recommend
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:47:16
Actually fortune cookies only exist in America
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:37:03
I put in $100 bitcoin and wanted the matching bonus. They shaft me and said that in order to get the bonus and winnings. You have to bet 30x the $200 so that was like $6k. That's why I figure I lost the money anyway so I played recklessly with 21
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:47:05
So did blow it?
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:25:24
What site do you use?
Glad to hear that you are now at peace with where you are at.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:20:29
Only play for fun. I almost lost everything because gambling is crazy
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:07:50
Good shit, did you quit gambling for good? I still have those urges

Than what is it? Don't be delusional
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:31:34
Got to take emotions out of the game and follow your strategy
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:52:07
Do you have any advices?
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:10:44

I am a college student, I won 10k from online gambling. I honestly don't need the money. I took out 5k last 2 weeks. This is my last semester so I will get a full time job soon.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:12:27
Top 3
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:45:15
Not good still leaking
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:44:44
Idk to be honest, maybe hold for 1 month or 5 years. I am somewhat optimistic. I don't want to miss out X 10 times or whatever
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:11:54
That's very true
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:57:28

I put in $100 bitcoin and wanted the matching bonus. They shaft me and said that in order to get the bonus and winnings. You have to bet 30x the $200 so that was like $6k. That's why I figure I lost the money anyway so I played recklessly with 21
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:36:24
I was a little late in seeing the price
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:46:04
This could be the start of a revolution
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:11:30
I don't have any income right now since college student. When I do, probably bet like $20-$100 a NFL game to make it more fun to watch
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:55:22
Which one first?
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:38:40
So people can just take his idea without paying a fee?
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:32:50
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:39:00
That's why I stopped
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:51:16
Thanks homie
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:47:05
So did blow it?
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:24:51
What a dumbass, that was still worth $35k at the time

What is ACH? Excuse my poor knowledge
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:34:38
How long till back to 4.5k?
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:57:35
Why would I want it to? I have a lot of my net worth in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:30:33
What you guys to do about taxes?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:51:17
Than what is it? Don't be delusional
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:34:19
What are you going to do about like taxes?
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:11:30
I don't have any income right now since college student. When I do, probably bet like $20-$100 a NFL game to make it more fun to watch

@_date: 2017-09-07 04:57:45
Does it ever come in after business hours? So I can stop checking?
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:20:29
Only play for fun. I almost lost everything because gambling is crazy
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:08:14
What would you do about emergency? Like car crash or hospital costs?
What if bitcoin go back to $2000?
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:32:50
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:49:59
If they really are your friend, they should accept the lost themselves. Should understand how volatile this shit is.
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:18:52
What happen before when bitcoin dropped 400 last time?
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:20:59
Fees? How much do they take and how much does coinbase?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:29:02
How do you short bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:26:18
Let’s be honest, you would have panicked and sold at the very first crash. Because you didn’t have the confidence to buy in
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:24:39
The thing is, I don’t want to verify in Coinbase my identity 
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:37:12
What is up a bit and down for a while?
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:44:04
I don’t like it that big banks like JP Morgan can just come in and make money off this without giving up nothing
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:45:15
Not good still leaking
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:40:43

What site do you use?
Glad to hear that you are now at peace with where you are at.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:18:53
You know very well that no one actually read those. Thank you though
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:57:29
I like to be off the grid
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:05:42
Why be rude? There’s a human being with feelings and emotions behind the username
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:17:36
How much is the fee?
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:57:20
I am a college student, I won 10k from online gambling. I honestly don't need the money. I took out 5k last 2 weeks. This is my last semester so I will get a full time job soon.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:07:50
Good shit, did you quit gambling for good? I still have those urges
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:57:23
Why the low rating and thank you
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:44:37
I have not sold yet, I just want to complain
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:39:28
Useless comment...
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:39:00
That's why I stopped
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:27:53
Why do old people like to use the word millennial?
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:36:46
Hopefully man, tire of this human shit
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:54:03
Why lol
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:51:30
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:03:29
Who says I am not on the ship? Look at the charts and tell me again there no pullbacks
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:34:00
That's not true. If bitcoin doesn't crash from 2017-2140. No one knows
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:33:04
So what wallet should I use instead?
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:36:48
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:48:23
300 is a pretty sizable drop
Then from 4350 to where?
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:10:03
I thought you were joking. Might break 4500 today
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:46:24
Not increasing as much as bitcoins
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:34:59
That's smart actually, can avoid a part of the fees
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:38:50
So we don’t get free money?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:20:55
Obviously has no life, what a loser
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:33:29
I edit the post
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:58:27
I made a post back asking if we will hit 5000 or 3000 first. People laugh at me. Then a week later, it started crashing to 2940 then rebound
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:43:58
What does this mean?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:55:11
Really you think it break 9000k because of a random holiday weekend lol
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:58:36
This subreddit runs on meme. Like it or not, memes are used to keep people engage and works as a forum of advertisement. If it can bring more awareness to Bitcoin, I do not see a problem.
How is advertising feeding on people weakness? That is a ludicrous statement. I am sure you have been in crypto for at least a year now. How do you describe or explain to people about bitcoin? You believe in the technology so you are also advertising for Bitcoin. People who you end up convincing that Bitcoin is the future is also thinking to themselves that they are missing out.
What’s the difference? My method is to get more awareness like yours.
People like you disgust me. Why? Because people like you are self-righteous and keyboard warriors. You don’t live in the real world. If this upsets you, you should unsubscribe from this subreddit now because this subreddit is a echo chamber.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:54:35
So short term you think? I don’t think it will break 6k. Will be fomo to 9k easy if it breaks 6k
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:36:24
He was a bull before
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:05:16
Next time set it to auto buy instead of going all in
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:34:53
Why is it up
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:28:51
Why would they not give a chance of it again at $10,000? That’s how Fomo starts. You are ridiculous making a artificial number
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:10:55
What was he trying to say?
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:27:04
I know what a short is but don’t know what the timeline of a short is or when it close
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:04:01
This subreddit runs on memes. Reddit runs on memes. The internet runs on memes. If memes get people to be more aware of what’s happening in Bitcoin right now then I don’t see a problem in it. If Bitcoin is talked more in Reddit, maybe the media will start talking about it again. The general public think Bitcoin is dead right now.
You do not live in the real world. How do any causes get started without advertisement?
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:09:49
You are delusional again saying that a lot of people saying they knew it was going to $3k. Otherwise so many people wouldn’t be losing money
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:09:53
Front page!!!
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:09:24
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:35:15
Kevin bought the very top. Of course he is upset and bitter
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:39:02
You are being delusional when you say it won’t and I am a bull. No one thought it was going to go from 20k to 3k
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:16:52
It’s a joke. But he cares.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:10:04
Don’t @ me. I don’t want to waste time going back and forth with you
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:18:01
Good for bitcoin?
