I prefer cex.io , high limits, fast,  great support,  withdrawal to credit/debit card with 1.5% fees, exchange is not that popular so less volume but sometimes you can get same prices as on coinbase.

So what is your point? Its not Vitalik's fault that funds were stolen. It was parity wallet which was breached and the code for it wrote Gavin Wood, so stop with your shit.

It has much more things going on. Meanwhile btc is figthing about blocksize, ethereum eea added 200companys including Toyota,Samsung,Microsoft,Intel,Deloite and much more.. There will be another anouncment in June with prob. 100 more companys joining. Raiden should be released soon June-July (Lightning network on Ethereum), Metrpolis (Zksnarks..) should be august-september. A lot of projects, tests (Royal mint china, alibaba network...)Big exchanges adding ether(Houbi) and i have included prob. 1/3 things going on, there is to much, do your research.

Stfu with this bullshit. Iam using it for few months and it works perfect.

What is your point? Check this article, it was prob. banned here: 
Ethereum growth was 500% while btc was 10%. Its the marketcap % change that matters, not the price. You can get more ether for the price of bitcoin. 
Edit: Yeah downvote me now for speaking facts.
