Your right you know. Handing someone a 20$ is so complicated. If only there was a better way.

There is one printed on the last page of Yars Revenge manuals.

I received them also. I was confused for a while. I thought it was the reuse of old tx's for the purposes of overwhelming the system or creating some sort of disruption.

I'll remember that when I order some dates from Whole foods Budapest.

So, you are saying the misinformed and disillusioned may be saved by bitcoin!

"it gives you the opportunity to market to this affluent crowd"
Have you been to any meet ups? It's neck beards and ackward socials galore.
The bitcoin crowd is not going to be taking a woman to a romantic getaway at a B and B unless she is an Anime cartoon or a 1:43 second porn clip.
Edit: this isn't anyway, a negative assessment towards us, just an observation from experience.

Thanks, but this doesn't help me understand in any way what so ever though.

I've purchased tickets online for years, from 7$ movie tickets, 75$ Comicon tickets, plane tickets, and over 10,000$ of snowboarding lift season passes. 
I only had a problem once where the server was overloaded mid transaction and I had to call to verify if my purchase was verified.
Took 2 minutes of my time.

 And to love Bitcoin, is to know Bitcoin...
Those who know Bitcoin, love Bitcoin, while those who do not know Bitcoin, love Bitcoin from afar.

Hey, Everyone!  I was amazed at the amount of people at the Embassy today. This was my first meetup and I have to say that this is truly a revolutionary experience. I walked into my first meetup expecting neck beards and anarchists, what I found was a grouping of intelligent ,smart and bright people all sharing and open minded.
I am grateful to have met and spoken to so many. I brought my son and he got his first wallet set up and had just as many interesting conversations. 
What the folks from the Embassy have created and started is amazing. 
Bravo to all of you.
We are looking forward to the next meet up already.

A good friend?  I don't even know this person other than a 2 minute conversation. This guy was pitching a business opportunity, I listened and am just reporting on a similar idea I heard. So many of the ideas people are pitching are poorly thought out while some are just downright impressive. You have to wade through the BS like with any rush.

Mandrik to the rescue.

I met with an individual at Saturdays Bitcoin Embassy meet up in Montreal that is working on a similar program and he stated he already has the backing of 100 million in assets and cash to bolster the currency. 
They want to develop their own crypto currency combined with bitcoin and backed by conventional assets and cash from what I understood.
They are a sovereign nation and setting up their own Country.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:29:55
That part I understand, but if it's used in all Indian casinos adopted by the gambling community it may have legs. 
He says thier own crypto currency will only be 30% of the new currency as the other 70% will be backed by fiat cash/assets and bitcoin. The more I think about it it seems more like a fund or commodity they are trying to structure.
Anyhow, it's good that people are trying all sorts of different approaches. It's like the start of the Internet. The cream will rise to the top over time and lots of developments will occur and create many new opportunities that we can't even imagine at this time.
For that reason I am open minded to all new ideas and support people thinking and creating.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:07:37
Hi Mandrik, didn't get to shake your hand as it was so busy, but wanted to say I was happy to hear you speak.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:25:36
Were you there and listening to the actual presentation cause I was the one photographing the event so I missed 90% of what was said. He spoke to me after the talks and I was with others but this is exactly what I understood also.
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:46:51
I think I just understood. It's a Reddit Tip account thats set up for users. I manage it with my Reddit account.  Did I understand it correctly?
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:35:14
Wow, thanks for the tip. I'm have to get my head around this quick because now I'm even more confused about what to do with this tip and or how to put it in my wallet. Do I use the one I set up at coinbase? Not sure how or do I set up a new one at blockchain? I know it's simple to those that understand the procedures but as someone who considers himself tech literate I'm frustrated with myself at the moment.

No, I was with some VC's and he came over to talk to me as I had said hello to him earlier. I'm a Google Photographer and Entrepreneur.

"Wait till regulators get involved, then you'll get those fees"  
They way he responded to her, I could see he wanted to face palm but being on TV he just couldn't.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:31:06
I don't think they are open yet. I just emailed them.
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:09:01
Just did. Read it all and now I get it. I feel twice as knowledgeable as I did 24 hrs ago. I just want to understand it all right away because there is money involved and I feel pressured by the rise in price, but I'll just take my time and learn as I go.
Thanks for the guidance.
