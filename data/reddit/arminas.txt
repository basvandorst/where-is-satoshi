Btw right now (5:08 pm est) Dorsey is live on Joe Rogan Experience on youtube right now. Not talking about Bitcoin though. But I've always thought these long form podcasts give good insight into a person's character. They're debating ethics of Twitter, censorship, and some social media controversies like Cambridge analytica and foreign influence of the 2016 elections. Good stuff.

The actual losses are proportionately the same for all holders but that increase in value comes from either more total holders and/or more investment from each individual holder, making the total loss much more significant to the market.

Presumably it would be significant to your wallet because as the value of bitcoin grows, your stake in crypto will grow with it and represent a larger portion of your total value. if you have 100$ usd and 100$ in btc and the btc becomes 10x valued in however many years, now instead of the btc accounting for 50% of your wealth it accounts for 90%+~ and a 40% drop in the price of bitcoin will very significantly affect your total wealth. The concepts of market cap aren't disconnected to personal finance. idk why im being downvoted tbh. Its as if nobody expects their value in bitcoin to grow.

If you've parked 100% of your net worth in crypto the purchasing power of that crypto will still change over time according to it's value against other currency. Difference of personally losing thousands or tens of thousands vs millions

It's the same thing if you completely ignore market cap lol. Napkin math estimates a 40% devaluation of btc at 58000 per btc is about 320~ trillion total loss to the market. 
The great depression was a 400 billion usd loss.

There's a girl that I went to highschool with that took some seminar on day trading BTC. I asked her if she does any trading in alt coins and she was very confused what I meant by alt coin. Her instagram story every day is posting her latest profits and encouraging other people to go to this seminar. Meanwhile BTC is on a big upswing which will, in reality, be followed by a pretty big down swing and then the cycle will repeat a few more times until it really stabilizes. She's been doing this for about 6 months now so it'll be pretty hilarious to watch degeneration in real time. 
tldr bitcoin is cool now. for now.

? the market cap is an order of magnitude larger. You're talking about a value lost against the dollar in the hundreds of millions vs trillions
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:26:02
In total fairness if falling below 58000 is a 40% drop that would actually be a pretty huge drop lmfao that's more than just casual day trading losses

Every device is used for data collection now, and has been for at the very least the last 10 years. Applebaum did a great talk on the NSA capabilities that have been confirmed already, and most of what is known is dated from 2003. Even back then, they had the capacity to monitor every single solitary US citizen, farm and categorize the data, and store it accordingly for 15 years at a time. And there's hardly any reason to believe they haven't been doing exactly that.

The same amount of people that think Bitcoin is magic internet money that can be created out of thin air by anyone who can use the command prompt in Windows.
