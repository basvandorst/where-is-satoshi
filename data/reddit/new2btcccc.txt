I did not say omg, and where did I use an exclamation and we really did almost have a death spiral. You are experiencing cognitive dissonance, look I get it i was too. You don’t want to hear or believe it I know, neither do I. Do your research, it’s very simple. If the forked coin becomes more profitable, miners will switch. The Bitcoin network will slow down significantly. With that, the bitcoin price will likely dump, making The other coin even more profitable. It can happen, please don’t overlook this. Thanks for having an intellectual discussion!

You don’t get it. The TX won’t be slow, not hours or days. They will NEVER get processed. The network will freeze, difficulty will be too high for the miners and bitcoin will be dead. It’s really that simple. The miners only care about profitability. If the forked coin becomes way more profitable for a sustained amount of time,  bitcoin will die.

Not into shorting, will hold the forked coin equally. That is the best thing, and I recommend you do it.

You are funny... I’d take a trezor from Santa 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:55:02
Ok, we are closer to having an actual discussion. how is my argument uneducated? It makes perfect sense and seems very plausible, if the miners switch, difficulty will be too high to process any transactions, the chance of bitcoindying pre fork was nil. Now it is a lot higher and maybe even likely.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:19:04
It can still happen. I see it as unavoidable honestly.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:27:38
Ok look I will try to explain this once more. Miners care about profitability. They switch to a more profitable chain. The remaining miners will not be able to solve the block. It will be technically impossible, because the difficulty will not be adjusted until the period is over. So, for example, say we are on block 1500 in the difficulty, and block 2016 is when the difficulty is adjusted. Say bitcoin crashes, miners switch, the network slows down. The txs will still get processed, slowly. But say The other coin will start to go up, furthering the profitability gap. More miners switch. Bitcoin is frozen. Next block is impossible to solve, the hash rate just isn’t there anymore, difficulty is far too high. The network is 100% frozen. Instead of calling me a troll, tell me how this can’t happen. That is how you have a discussion.

No thanks, r/btc is toxic and so is this sub. I care about bitcoin very much and apparently no one on this sub cares like I do. Shouldn’t you be more concerned if you like Bitcoin? If you are calling it fud, you might not understand the technical aspect of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:47:11
man It’s a lot of work to get a discussion going on this subreddit. Here’s how it works. Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. If the forked coin becomes more profitable, miners will switch to that coin. Bitcoin will slow down significantly, likely causing a price drop. Which will force even more miners to switch to the forked coin, as they would be losing money mining bitcoin. If that happens, what ever miners are left, the difficulty will be far too high to process any transactions, and the chain will die since bitcoin cannot be sent anywhere, thus the forked coin taking over. This is a terrible outcome, but how is this not plausible? Please tell me.

How am I embarrassing myself when You are the one that clearly doesn’t understand it. A death spiral has nothing to do with price, as your post implies. It is a technical scenario. Here is how it works: Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. If the forked coin becomes more profitable, miners will switch to that coin. Bitcoin will slow down significantly, likely causing a price drop. Which will force even more miners to switch to the forked coin, as they would be losing money mining bitcoin. If that happens, for what ever miners are left on the bitcoin chain, the difficulty will be far too high to process any transactions. The chain will die since bitcoin cannot be sent anywhere, thus the forked coin taking over. This is a terrible outcome, but how is this not plausible? Please tell me.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:33:06
Ok.... and what’s the consensus? I thought that’s what this subreddit was for... you know... talking about Bitcoin. It’s not all unicorns and rainbows. How can this death spiral be prevented? I see no way of it being prevented in the coming years
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:14:21
Really? I’m labelled as a troll? I seriously care for Bitcoin and am looking for a serious discussion. I can’t have it on R/BtC and I can’t have one here apparently. So where can I go to talk about Bitcoin with people who are educated on the matter?
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:26:24
Yeah, he’s right here. We aren’t out of the woods on this yet, this is a vulnerability that is here to stay and I hate it. It is seriously stressing me out, but so far I have only had one person actually make a useful post. Read all these comments left here, no one is taking this seriously. Do you guys even care about Bitcoin? Both Bitcoin subs are toxic, so embarrassing.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:16:08
So I can’t gave a serious discussion here or on R/btc. This community is truly great. Someone has a legitimate concern and no one actually talks about it. Look, this is a real vulnerability period the end. I know, it triggers cognitive dissonance, but it’s true. What can we do? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:21:55
Thank you, you are the only person that actually contributed something useful. The Bitcoin community is toxic unfortunately. I stayed away from Rbtc and lurked here... I’ll be staying away from both now. Thanks friend.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:28:16
I got into bitcoin in 2014. My username means nothing. I do understand it, if I’m wrong, I would love to have a discussion on how. That’s why I posted this thread in the first place.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:41:27
Good point, thanks for the discussion that’s all I want, but instead I get called a troll by other people. There are a lot of money investing into it, but money and development isn’t the only thing we need to look at. Hash rate is arguably more important, as that’s how the network functions. If the forked coin becomes more profitable for miners, they will switch to mining the fork. Bitcoin will slow down, and potentially crash, which makes the other coin even more profitable. If the majority of miners switch, bitcoin will freeze, because the difficulty will be too high for the remaining miners. No transactions will be processed and the chain will die. This can actually happen.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:18:33
How does that discredit my post in any way? I’m not a bitcoiner for a day. I’ve had this account since the fork happened.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:09:32
I just re read your first post. You thought I was talking about price, oh no no no, I’ve been around since 2014 price drops are nothing. This is a Network flaw.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:15:57
What? How will the tx get processed? You saying that shows you are the uneducated one. If the difficulty is too high, the block cannot be solved. That is how bitcoin is designed. If the majority of miners switch, no more blocks will be mined.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:36:43
Will explode in five billion years, that’s besides the point. This could happen with in the year. Why are you acting like it’s impossible? Is it just cognitive dissonance or are you going to provide a useful discussion?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:08:17
It’s all good man, thanks for the post! I agree, u/Renben9 did help out.
