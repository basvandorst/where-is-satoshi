I'd love to tip posts/comments that people put work into to spread the word!
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:55:21
Really? What's the reason for that?
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:26:40
I haven't heard anything about that, did he mention what the news is about?

Did you even read the post?

Kraken, although the USD volume is pretty low. They're great for Europe.
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:07:40
But then you need to trust that site, and with Bitcoin you're meant to not trust anyone.

It probably works like this: the signed transaction is sent to the merchant's server who then broadcasts it.

*The coinbase is the content of the 'input' of a generation transaction. While regular transactions use the 'inputs' section to refer to their parent transaction outputs, a generation transaction has no parent, and creates new coins from nothing.*

Correct, your brainwallet words shouldn't be related to each other at all, because that makes it actually practical to bruteforce them. If you use reasonably random numbers though, you don't have anything to worry about. Especially if you generate it offline. If you do it correctly, it's 100% impossible for hackers to get it because it was never online.

No.  
However, there are clients that don't require you to download the blockchain (that's what it's called) like Electrum.

What he meant is that splitting it up to multiple addresses first means you don't have to spend the funds in 1 address, wait for the transaction to confirm, use the change address, wait for confirm, etc. which would mean they could only do 1 transaction per hour.
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:00:30
[You can use multisig transactions for that](
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:10:03
You're right, I did get that wrong. I looked up the definition and *think* that it actually means that it has not happened yet, but it may happen in the future. However, there's no possibility for it to happen in the future when the data simply doesn't exist, which makes the statement not true.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:47:03
QR codes can include the amount and unless it's a high amount of money, you normally don't need to wait for a verification.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:01:56
Although that's a bit beyond average use of BTC, you can use Multisig transactions for that with a reasonably trustworthy 3rd party. From a merchant's perspective it's definitely an advantage though that transactions can't be reversed.

Problem is, 99.9% of the network gets your transaction within seconds, so your 2nd transaction won't appear in the network as it gets rejected.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:47:00
The only source we have is the reporter though, so it doesn't even have to be true that he said that.

greenaddress.it seems to be the best solution at the moment. And backups could easily be made user friendly by storing them encrypted in Google Drive/Dropbox.

Normally, you can assume that a transaction will get confirmed if it's spotted by a large part of the network and a fee is included. When buying a coffee, it doesn't make sense to wait for a confirmation. When buying something that costs a lot though, it is recommended to wait for a confirmations. Keep in mind, you can undo credit card transfers for 2 (?) months afterwards, while a BTC transaction with fee included will get confirmed and thus not be undoable 99.99% of the time

A paper wallet is just one address, the transaction takes all your current addresses and combines the balance to send them to one address, which you can easily check the current balance of.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:43:36
The fact that you can pay with your phone within seconds and the merchant can give you a discount and still make the same profit because he doesn't have to pay credit card fees. Also, paying everywhere without having to pay fees for currency conversion (transaction fee is ~6.5 cents).

[Coinkite]( does just that, although it kinda defeats the purpose of BTC, because you are trusting a 3rd party.

Usually, you go online when you want to use the funds in a cold wallet. The other approach would be to manually create a transaction, sign it offline and broadcast it online (this way, the actual private key is never online) although that's a lot more complicated.
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:35:25
It's not a high priority as you should never rely on the tx id to check if a transaction took place or not, so with the correct implementation it isn't a problem at all.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:44:08
But it's "not *yet*", which implies it will be sold later if he doesn't pay. So it's not true.

Import the wallet.dat in Multibit and send them to an Electrum wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:31:58
But Armory runs a full node, which means he has to download the blockchain. Electrum is considered the best light client.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:35:14
Only the private key needs to be cold, because that's what allows you to access your BTC. You can do whatever you want with the public address.

A mining pool runs a full node and software to connect to the miners. The ASIC does nothing more than hash the block with a certain nonce and return the results.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:45:43
You don't really understand how Bitcoin works, I'll try to explain it to you:
When you make a transaction, the transaction is *signed* with your private key. This means that it can be verified that the owner of the private key did this transaction and not someone else. However, it is not possible to get your private key from this.
@_date: 2016-05-06 00:08:26
The coins from the genesis block cannot be spent, so he does mean the second block.
