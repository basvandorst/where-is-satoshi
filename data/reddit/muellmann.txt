Sounds good to me. I'd invest everything in bitcoin too, but I already put all of my cash in whatever is the advice in the highest rated post on r/wallstreetbets once a month. You only yolo once!

Most people don't hold thousands of coins. If you bought at 200/300$ why would you sell if it goes all the way down to $2? Your money is already gone, might as well hold and see if it ever goes up again. How can anyone need a few dollars that urgently?

Stalking intensifies...

I suggest that everyone reports this to reddit and hopefully all spammer accounts get banned soon.

I agree. He probably also meant to say banknotes, not "money". Any digital currency is clearly money too.

Poor people are mostely poorly educated as well. Bitcoin is fairly complicated to understand and use. If it was just about fees Western Union and co would already be packing up, because all expats and migrant workers would be using bitcoin. But their business is better than ever. Most people don't understand Bitcoin, they think it's risky and probably also like the convenience of servies like M-Pesa (which charges outrageous fees according to the wikipedia page). And then you have the problem with keeping your bitcoins safe. Should they keep them on their smartphone? Cause the average Kenyan doesn't own a computer!

That would be the time I stop trading on okcoin then. I love using Wechat just like the next guy in China, but no thanks, way to dodgy.

As a German I had to laugh when I read that sentence. I don't know the situation in other European countries but here at least there is no negative interest on regular accounts yet (for the banks that I'm using it isn't even 0). And if there was, people still wouldn't be flocking to Bitcoin, which 99% see as way too risky. Come on, be real! Does anyone here have their life savings all in Bitcoin? Yes, the price has been steadily going up, but no one knows where bitcoin is really headed in the long run. That's just investment 101. You don't put all your eggs in one basket.

Hey, interesting read!
I'd like to know how bitcoin is faring in the Philippines in general so far. Do you feel like interest is slowly growing? Cause internatinal transactions are one of the only strong points I see for Bitcoin so far, where it actually makes practical sense using it. And since so many Filipinos are sending money back home every day, I can see huge potential for Bitcoin there.

What they are saying is that a hacker beloning to "anonymous" has traced several bitcoin addresses back to ISIS and one (presumably the largest) contains 3 million USD in bitcoins. 
Not really big news in my opinion. That can't be more than a tiny fraction of their founds.
