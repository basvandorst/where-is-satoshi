If there is ever a Coinbase hack I'll be eating these words, but I agree with For most people, if you step back and look at total risk including risk of weaknesses in people's own PC and network security then Coinbase cold storage starts to look like a viable option. And for the folk who think "I can do it myself with an air-gapped Tails distro doing offline N-of-M key cold storage", consider your heirs and their probable complete inability to recreate what you did when you are gone. Or write it all down, and risk losing it that way. Ick.
Most people seem to think "dying" is a Black Swan event and could never cause them to lose access to their BTC, whereas in fact it is a guaranteed outcome in the long run... :)

Hey now, all I missed was a deep link! 
I keep eyeing your multi-sig vault as an upgrade to simple cold storage vault, but I read "somewhere online" that at the actual point of signing transactions the browser either has access to two keys or at least can direct Coinbase to have access to two keys. Is this accurate? If not, apologies for repeating FUD.

No, I'm saying that Coinbase has decided their service is worth 1.5% now, whereas previously they decided it was 1%. The free market will decide whether it agrees with them.
If I were starting out in crypto now, I might be willing to deal with just Coinbase, rather than Coinbase + Circle, to skip the hassle of verifying with two separate companies and transferring (scary!) BTC purchases from Circle to a Coinbase vault. Or I might not... One can't really go back in time and check. 
I do know that if I were a more seasoned crypto buyer making scheduled larger investments, I'd choose the best of both worlds and go ACH-&gt;GDAX (free) then 0% maker fee buys (free) then transfer to Coinbase vault or my own cold storage. Circle provides zero utility in this scenario.

I don't get the issue, really. It seems mostly to impact novice bitcoiners or occasional/impulse purchasers who need it right now (subject to instant purchase limits). For them, there is a extra 0.5% fee to compensate for the security (relative to a novice doing it themselves) or speed of the purchase (Coinbase is taking the risk of the bank transfer not working). Value costs money. If you think the value isn't enough for the cost, then maybe you aren't the target audience. If there are enough people who think this way, Coinbase will presumably notice this slowdown in business and adjust. My bet is, there are enough people who will find the value or convenience justifies the cost.
For other cases like larger purchases, experienced bitcoiners, traders, long-term investors, etc. there is a completely free path to go USD-&gt;BTC and later BTC-&gt;USD via Coinbase GDAX: free USD ACH deposits/withdrawals + 0% maker fees make it so any serious crypto purchaser can convert USD-&gt;BTC and store it in Coinbase in a wallet or vault, or transfer out to your own storage, or make a big purchase, or to some other exchange if you want to do trading w. higher volumes and/or margin. Yes, it takes a little more planning and doesn't have that instant gratification of "buy it now" but if one is doing enough business with Coinbase to really care about 0.5%, then one could presumably apply a modicum of planning and drop your fees to *nothing*.

He publicly stated that he dumped most of his coins before leaking the news. That said, I just re-read all of his posts on the topic and he also asserts a self-imposed 30-day trading ban. So my earlier comment that he had re-bought but obfuscated that fact was incorrect - it was in actuality a pre-leak purchase that had not cleared yet.
I still find it offputting that this is the same guy who is claiming the high moral ground and lambasting the Bitcoin Foundation members for allegedly trading on insider information.

I dont get how BitX is really any solution here, the volumes are so low as to be laughable. According to this page -  - today's total daily volume was 2.92 - no, that isn't missing zeros - less than 3 BTC total.

I agree wholeheartedly with this. Most 'complicated' things can, in actuality, be explained pretty simply if the explainer really understands their material and adapts the explanation to the level of the listener's understanding.
Technobabble explanations that leave the audience saying "it's too complicated for me" are usually the result of a presenters who care more about demonstrating how smart they are or care more about being 100% comprehensive even if it hurts understanding ("to explain bitcoin, first let me explain SHA-256 with mathematical proofs").
The best technical educator I ever knew had a great saying: *"Don't let the facts get in the way of the truth"*. It's so true - you can teach almost anything if you focus on walking the listener methodically up the hill of understanding, *at their pace*.

FYI the sale of 230 coins caused the price to go from 631 to 630, eating up the 180 bid wall that had been sitting at 630 for a while. For whomever sold, it was a good time to take very little slippage (that is, if one believed the price would decline organically anyway). Since price had popped the magic 630, other sellers then dumped a couple hundred more coin in smaller orders, dropping price to 626. In theory the 230 coin seller could have partially refilled at 626. Just pointing out that nervousness doesn't explain every sell...

Up until the time MtGox died, they supported 2 exchanges - MtGox &amp; Bitstamp. MtGox was actually the first exchange that RT-BTC supported. Presumably (hopefully?) they will add more over time.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:37:11
Just the monthly fee.
They offer a deeper view into the order book than the Bitstamp web site, and it updates in real-time. They also integrate charting with the order book and trading interface, so you have a much more holistic view than tabbing between BitcoinWisdom, Bitcoinity and your exchange web site. Lastly, they seem to go down less than BitcoinWisdom during periods of high volatility, which is exactly when you need them.
Overall they are worth the money IMO, both the old price of $14/month and the new price of $20/month, but it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth for the acquisition that the first thing that happens is the price gets jacked up by 50%. Which is also completely the opposite thing to what Blockchain.info did with the ZeroBlock acquisition (the iPhone app went to free), so I don't understand their reasoning.

To be precise, I never actually stated he was insider trading, just that he was trading ahead of his own release of market-moving news. Which is IMO not the actions of someone holding themselves out as a moral guardian for the ecosystem.
HOWEVER, you are not correct about what is considered insider trading. Especially "There's nothing wrong with trading on insider information unless you specifically agreed not to" is categorically NOT true in the legal sense. 
For example, look at the SEC page covering this:  where it states "Friends, business associates, family members, and other "tippees" of such officers, directors, and employees, who traded the securities after receiving such information".
In this very talk, TBI states that he received the leaked document from a consultant known to have been hired by Mt Gox, that he reached out to Charlie Shrem to confirm, who reached out to Mark Karpeles to confirm. When it was all confirmed, TBI sold his coins and then released the news. To me that sounds an awful lot like the above definition - a leaked document from the company, confirmed by the company's CEO, being traded on by a "tippee" ahead of public release of the news.
IMO, TBI stepped WAY over the line. Way, way, way over.

Since it is capital property, does this mean I can sell it below my cost basis (assuming price has dropped) and then rebuy, to lock in some losses as a capital loss that I can deduct?
For stocks you can't do this due to wash sale rules - but real property you can, so in your opinion is tax loss harvesting valid for BTC now? I read the 1040 rules as allowing this, but I heard conflicting claims "on the internetz" so I'd like an opinion from someone more familiar with the rules in this space.

In TBI's defense, he has been pretty public about his trading. I've criticized him for effectively insider trading (although as has been pointed out, this is not illegal outside of the securities market), but he sure has been transparent about his actions - kudos for that IMO.
He announced the Gox stuff Feb 24, and on Feb 25 in [this]( he wrote "*I made a judgment call to sell all of my bitcoin holdings with Coinbase, and have a self-imposed restriction not to buy or sell additional bitcoins for 30 days...I sold my 64.5 bitcoins at an average price of $550.  Most recently, the price of Bitcoin has rebounded to $530 on Coinbase.  At no point during the selloff did I initiate new positions.  Nor do I plan to.*". He reiterated this commitment in his interview with CNN [here]( There was a minor complication this involving 17 coins bought earlier but not sold, but I don't think that conflicts with the spirit of what he was saying.
So basically, he publicly committed to not buying or selling any BTC until 30 days from Feb 24 - that is, March 26. In this regard he is a better man than I - or at least one more cursed with inside information! :)

I just had a ham sandwich. Thought you guys should know. It was big news, for me.

I agree with all these points - overall I'm happy with Coinbase. I stand by my comments though, that the area they are weak right now (and have recently gotten weaker) is in servicing people who want to get BTC quickly. 
Your comments about risk and potential downsides are all valid. Notice that I didn't make any requests for lower verification though - I agree that with larger instant purchase options, they would need MORE information about their customers, or risk far too many chargebacks. But for now they seem to have not elected to offer this as a service - presumably because the demand doesn't justify the risk/effort.

That's really wierd, what you are describing sounds more like a managed 401k than BrokerageLink. In fact, I thought BrokerageLink was specifically designed FOR people to self-manage their retirement assets in a 'normal' brokerage account. Bummer...
I know when I signed up for BL it was a giant PITA, had to disclaimer everything ("Yes, if I put it all into penny stocks and wind up living under a bridge in a cardboard box, it isn't Fidelity's fault"), but once all the paperwork was done it was just a regular brokerage account with minor restrictions like "you can't buy your companies stock" (since the 401k provides that natively) and "some of the riskier financial weapons of mass destruction like uncovered options are off limits".

API keys were working for a while after they disabled login. I was trading at 5am PST using ZeroBlock, after the email from Bitstamp.net support saying logins were disabled woke me up &gt;.&lt;.
Then later in the day, the API keys got disabled. ZeroBlock's failure mode here was to not tell me the API was disabled, but to keep showing me my personal trade history, and show my open orders as blank and my USD$ and BTC balances as zero. I had a minor freakout! xD
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:21:04
I did too, and linked back to this post. Multiple API clients are having this issue, it's almost definitely on Bitstamp's side (or their DDoS provider, or something related to their networking).

Wait, so the 'big news' was they are INCREASING the price for RTBTC by almost 50%!!!??!
On Saturday I bought 15 days of RTBTC service for 0.010495BTC, or about $7 at today's price of $675/BTC. 1 month would have cost me ~$14.
Today after the Blockchain.info acquisition the price is $20/month. This sucks.
@_date: 2014-01-27 09:45:28
100% agree - Coinbase is a standout in this regard. When I'm trying to move fiat into BTC on an exchange, it's a giant PITA/sometimes impossible to know exactly what the BTC is going to cost me. With Coinbase it is crystal clear and set the moment you press the "Confirm purchase" button. IMO this clarity and simplicity is worth the slight annoyances that come from using them as your main source of BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:08:17
Would this be the video where TBI laid out exactly how he insider traded?
If Bitcoin was more mainstream I think people would be much more outraged by this. And there might even be actual consequences.
He was leaked confidential documents by an insider. Upon confirming them he traded on this inside information. If this was the stock market and someone did this, they would have the SEC on their ass.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:49:22
Coinbase lets you set up regular buys, denominated in either $ or BTC. They also have a feature to send BTC or $ on a regular schedule, so you could set it up to purchase instantly (assuming you are not making large regular buys) and send directly to your cold storage wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:23:20
Good stuff, I was really hoping this might be the case. 
In general, the treatment of BTC as a capital property is a pretty big deal IMHO. So many people whining about why it's not a currency, it was nice to hear a counter-argument from Chamath Palihapitiya in his talk @ Coinsummit today, where he pointed out that property opens up all kinds of interesting "hang onto more of your wealth" options previously reserved for the 1%.
So here's another question for you. If BTC is capital property, why can I not use it to acquire other property in a like-kind property swap agreement, and pay no tax on the appreciation in value at the time of the swap? Clearly you cannot trade BTC for a house this way (the properties are not like-kind), but by my understanding of property exchange rules, I **could** exchange BTC to an altcoin this way. Or even (my mind == blown if this is a correct reading, but I can't say why it **isnt't** legal) BTC to BTC when the price drops.
Is this a correct understanding of like-kind exchanges?

It makes sense for them to denominate in $, since their stated reason for limits is to protect them as a company.
Frankly I'm surprised they left the $50k/day for Level 2 customers in place. 
Notice that their blog post used an example of when BTC was $300 to explain why their 10BTC/day Level 1 limit was converting to $3k/day, but used a DIFFERENT point in time when BTC was $100 to explain why the 50BTC/day Level 2 limit was converting to $50k/day.
I'm sure Level 2 customers would have screamed blue murder if Coinbase had pegged it at $15k/day, which would have been consistent with the Level 1 limit BTC-&gt;$ conversion. So I suspect this pseudo-math was a deliberate act of self-preservation on Coinbase's part.
The 1BTC/*week* instant buy is still the standout bad limitation for people new to BTC who want to actually spend BTC, not hoard it. If this was a daily limit, I'd have less issue with it. Or alternatively, if we could choose to use our credit cards to fund the instant buy, and have it actually be instant (possibly even being subject to additional credit card processing fees). My guess is long-term either they introduce new products to cover this scenario, or some other vendor introduces a competing product to satisfy the demand.

No personal vendetta. Just pointing out what he did is what in financial markets they call "insider trading". Whether he profited or not from is is irrelevant to whether it is considered insider trading.
Oddly enough, as much as the video prompted me to think about and revise my opinion of TBI wrt insider trading, it also raised my opinion of his claims that the foundation needs an overhaul. I think he also carried himself quite well on the panel - and some of the others on the panel seemed to in agreement. So maybe TBI has the right idea, and just has been following the wrong media strategy.
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:40:52
It is for me. After trading last year, and as a holder-not-trader currently, there is little reason to sell when the price is semi-stable until it is at least in the long-term gains category.

Downvote my earlier post if you must - but recognize that I am merely correcting incorrect suppositions, not saying that I condone TBI's overall approach to revealing news. 
I've been pretty consistent here and elsewhere on Reddit with my criticisms of TBI - I find his actions misguided at best, and unethical at worst. However, where he falls along this spectrum depends on his motives, which it is hard to know for sure. And in this instance the facts are on his side.
I think his reply below is fair. The ultimatum was bungled, agreed. But I find it credible &amp; even honorable that he is avoiding capitalizing on the FUD, assuming he sticks to his promise of no trading until Mar 26. If not, he is pond scum.
This is actually pretty sucky for his BTC holdings - I bet we're already headed moonwards by March 26!!

This is a promising step. I wonder if it will end up showing in the "cash", "investments" or "other" sections on Mint...
What would be really cool is if Mint offered the ability to add a public wallet address, so you could have Mint monitor the public (watch) address of your paper wallet, web wallet, etc. That way you could use Mint to track inflows and outflows without having to share any private info with them.
