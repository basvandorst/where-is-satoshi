Exactly, but that is partially why Governments try to regulate currency, albeit they often fail miserably. The greed is a large contributing factor to those gaming the system, it's also a factor for the exchanges not shutting down during the turmoil as many were calling for yesterday. The exchange continues to get their fee even while others are trying to scam the system.

Dumb people shouldn't be listening. It's your fault for taking advice from a stranger on Reddit.

$10,000 a bitcoin will never happen. The Governments will get involved before that point.

Who is reporting it to the IRS? Are the exchanges reporting these sales to the IRS?

If you were going to buy a car why didn't you cash out as soon as you decided to buy the car? Right now Bitcoin is a speculation market at best. If you have a goal reach it and get the hell out.

I very much enjoy reading about both the people who got rich on the way up and the people who have crashed on the way down. 
If truthful it provides a realistic view into the ups and downs of investing in such a volatile commodity.

Thanks. The comments have been intriguing. Some people think I couldn't be more off track, others think I'm exactly right. I love the internet.

That's true, and that's Capitalism at its best.  My larger point is what does the Bitcoin community want for the currency? It seems like the choice is between stability with more central regulation, or instability but with the benefits of complete decentralization.

No but how hard would it be for the exchanges/wallets to steal bitcoins and claim hacking?
