I think people are holding now but I don't think is a bad thing.  There isn't much to do yet with bitcoins in everyday life. I think people are hanging on to them with the hopes that in the future it will be a more common way of buying things. The coins that people have now will be worth more when bitcoins become more practical.
It may still suffer giant swings in price but in the coming five years as it is implemented into society it will settle on a price much higher then it is now.

May explain the drop in price.....xo

It may have something to do with silk road being down and if it was taken away for good it may hit 50 but think about where it would be if Paypal and Ebay jumped on board.... Bitcoins are driving silk road and silk road in a way is driving bitcoins for now but when major legitimate companies are on board and normal people are using it to buy things it will make silk roads part in bitcoins look like nothing in comparison.
