The user interface of my app is far better than any of the exchanges' websites viewed from a mobile device. I also provide many additional features on top of the exchanges such as market orders on all exchanges, exporting history, and calculating an amount based on a desired total purchase value. (Example: I want to buy $1000 worth of BTC at $300. The app will calculate exactly how many BTC you want to buy instantly.)
Also you can switch between exchanges and currency pairs in a matter of seconds.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:49:27
Looks like they haven't added it as part of the response when my app requests a list of currency pairs. Once they add it, it will show up in my app.

Sorry, I just don't buy this. The article paints him as a guy who is obsessed with privacy to the point where he hardly uses his real name even in real life. Then, they want me to believe that he used his real name when he created a project whose legality he wasn't sure of? Yeah right.

Well that's just not true at all.

Bitcoin is used by a very small handful of tech-savvy people. You are way overstating its market mover advantage. If Google released their own altcoin, Bitcoin would quickly lose its perceived strength.

Hey Tim, thanks for the great work. I'll open up a few issues today.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:45:38
MTGox has not been making 500k a day for years.
That's their daily income.
In fact, there only appear to be 4 days where they ever made over $500k.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:07:03
Ever heard of swing trading? It's a completely acceptable trading ideology.
I sold 50% of my stack when the joint MtGox insolvency statement hit, and bought throughout the entire crash, knowing that it would eventually bottom out and rebound. I increased my total BTC holdings by 10% that night. I'm still holding the coins I bought, waiting for a good sell signal so I can pick up even more.
I personally don't even think that Bitcoin has enough volatility to be profitable for day trading on some days. Today there has not been enough movement to make money even if you bought at the lowest and sold at the highest once fees are factored in.
Bitcoin works best for swing trading or as a long-term investment.

@_date: 2014-05-05 23:14:52
It's a difficult situation. I've put most likely upwards of 100 hours into this app, so obviously I'm a bit tentative to just put it all out in the open. I've open sourced the cryptography mechanisms for the app. People who can understand computer language should be able to see that it is a closed system without leaks. Even if you have never done any programming you look at the code and try to understand each line, you should be able to understand how it works and why it's secure. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:11:04

If anything, this gives more credence to the idea that the doc was actually made by MtGox.
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:53:58
Okay, but you're still not gaining any from holders. In fact, if they sold your buy point would be lower, so they are actually making your buy point higher by holding.
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:59:13
Huh? You don't gain any money from hodlers, you gain money from people who panic sell late.
@_date: 2014-05-06 15:28:38
I'm sorry, I have to come back to this as it is rubbing me the wrong way. It sucks being pegged as a bad guy with malicious intentions when my intentions are actually pure as they can possibly be. I worked my ass off for the last few months to make a useful tool for everyone and it absolutely stings to get called a potential thief. No response necessary, I just want you to know how your words affect me. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:31:12
Not sure why you're getting downvoted.
Whenever someone asks me how many bitcoins I have, I just ask them how much money they have, and then they realize that they shouldn't have asked.
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:38:10
I actually said the opposite of that. Their apparent income vs apparent expenses would indicate that they are extremely profitable, but their recent actions suggest that they aren't.

Are you a programmer? If so, take a look at my code. I'm open to suggestions. Even if you're not a programmer you should still take a look at it, as it's fairly easy to translate into understandable logic.

100% chance this will be downvoted, bit I'm going to say it anyway. Your attitude is the reason the crypto community isn't really taken seriously yet
Not saying that you don't have a good point, but the way you present it is supremely childish.
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:12:48
No it's not on git (yet) I'm not sure if I'm going to be open sourcing anything outside of the encryption and decryption of the API keys.
Coinbase isn't an exchange so I won't be supporting it. If I decide to implement another exchange it'll be Bitfinex.

Hey man! Definitely remember you from that late night trading! I definitely am planning on adding both Cryptsy and Mintpal, as that's where I do most of my trading these days. [This is the library I'm using for my back end.]( They don't have Cryptsy up yet, but I'm really hoping they get it done soon!

With Bitcoin's volatility, I'm not sure you're much safer holding BTC during your flight.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:07:50
Um... if the price is going down doesn't that mean the strong hands are losing sell value on their bitcoins while the weak hands are gaining buy value with their dollars?
@_date: 2014-06-05 03:51:57
Anyone who becomes used to an exchange's interface just starts clicking through the confirm order dialogs. It would be wise to recognize when the user is attempting to place an order that will eat a significant part of the order book and ask for additional confirmation.
@_date: 2014-05-06 15:19:34
As far as I've seen, very few exchanges even allow you to withdraw via API key for obvious reasons.

Well that's just not true at all. If you're mining .2 BTC every day and cashing it out immediately I'm pretty sure you're going to care a lot about the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:23:20
When placing markets orders, you only need to supply an amount (ie: I want to buy 0.5 BTC right now). When placing a limit order, you supply an amount and a limit price (ie: I want to buy 0.5 BTC at $425).

I don't think he's complaining about BTC not being stable. He's just pointing out that a bunch of people trying to save 1% in fees has actually tanked the value by about 15%.
You are saying that you sell what you mine instantly. So if GHash hadn't freaked everyone out and caused the price to tank, you might be selling for 15% more. Seems like you are failing in your "quest for profit." (as nerdy and lame as that sounds)
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:18:17
Who would want to take that on? Aren't they dealing with seized funds and an investigation with the DHS and a lawsuit from CoinLab?
@_date: 2014-05-06 05:21:28
Well actually someone could decompile it. But really what I'd do as a non-developer of this app would be to root my device and go see what the device is actually writing to memory. I'd plug in a fake API key and secret and see what the device actually saves to memory. I'd also make sure that it's only communicating with the exchange's servers.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:36:06
I'm gonna call BS on this one, unless you turned 5 real btc into 30 gox btc. There is no way that this amount volatility can yield 600% profit in just a few days.

Since when is a decision that helps to reduce your income by 15% a decision not worth caring about that much?

Everyone in that thread completely ignored the update to the description.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:59:00
I made it myself after calculating their daily income from fees since 2010. You can find the data and calculate their average daily income over the past year here: 
Keep in mind that this is gross income, not profit. They have salaries to pay and servers to maintain.

That's not how mining works.

@_date: 2014-01-08 06:41:08
If you own &gt; 50% of the coins, then you can double-spend. This is different from Bitcoin in that you need to own &gt; 50% of the mining power to double-spend.
It would be exponentially more (some say prohibitively) expensive to double-spend a PoS coin.
Acquiring half of all the Peercoins in existence would be an extremely difficult task considering that some are surely permanently lost, and as you start to buy the price would soar exponentially.
Even then, once you own 51% of the coins, you have a vested interest in not crashing the value of the currency.
It's a pretty cool idea in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:41:41
What? He seems perfectly reasonable. I don't think we could have expected anything better from a regulator.

This wasn't meant to be a joke.
What do you think is more likely:
A troll concocts an elaborate strategy to crash a multi-billion dollar market yet half-asses the center-piece of his plan
MTGox, who have proven themselves to be incompetent time and time again spit out a half-assed "crisis strategy" the day their company goes under?
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:18:52
Because generally people (at least in this community) don't pay for something that they could easily just take for free.
Look at [Electrum.](
In my opinion it's by far the best wallet out there. He's providing a service to people that is worth a lot of money. Lightweight wallet, no blockchain, easy cold storage.
How much has he gotten paid for his work since February 2013 by the Bitcoin community? 
**0.55116871 BTC**, and a decent amount of that was when BTC was trading for under $100. Yes, Bitcoin would work extremely well for community-funded open-source projects, but the users will need to loosen their grip on their coins for this to come to fruition.
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:16:41
My main goal was to have full support for Bitstamp, BTC-e, and Bitfinex. They are by far the three biggest in the English-speaking Bitcoin community. Like I said in my other post, I would love to support Kraken but the API just isn't there yet. I use the Java XChange library so I'm somewhat at the mercy of what they support and don't support. I've tested their library with Kraken and I get bad data. Hopefully whoever is at fault, Kraken or XChange, can get it remedied soon.

How would it not hurt his investors? He would be purposely returning BTC worth way less just for the sake of returning the right amount of BTC.
If they invested when BTC was $7 and receive a bunch of BTC worth $2 because of his doings, then I'd feel a bit ripped off.
@_date: 2012-10-27 16:53:48
Small vendors cash out via sites like fastcash4bitcoins, large vendors launder the money through an off-shore corporation and have no issues with getting money through MtGox.

You didn't really lose 20k bitcoins to pirate, unless that's what you began your investment with. Unless you got lucky and withdrew before he defaulted, you were never going to see those 20k bitcoins anyway. They never existed.
5k to BitFloor, that sucks though.
@_date: 2012-10-06 03:35:25

They may have just ignored you. A lot of them have a large stack of coins and someone saying, "Wanna meet up 20 minutes away so I can buy .05% of your bitcoins?" just doesn't sound like a good use of time. Just for science, make them a huge offer and see how many respond.

The first handful of people that saw it panicked and sold causing a minor drop, and everyone else jumped in and started selling as well. This is what's causing the drop. Once most of the people who sit at their computers all day who are aware of this stop panic selling, the price will stabilize.

As you get older one thing you realize is that it's okay to come to grips with the fact that the world isn't perfect - and that you don't have to get all knotted up over it.
The world may not be organized in a way that seems "logical" to you - but do you really think it's truly possible to have an entire societal system that pleases everyone? We do our best.
You may not be okay with the way the world works and you may not think it's logical, but nothing is stopping you from setting up your own life how you please and how you think is logical. Don't listen to the ones who tell you that the world is oppressive and there's something outside you that's holding you back... because those are the people who are doing the exact things they preach against.

@_date: 2013-12-17 18:09:20
I don't think that a single PC should be doing it. I just think that the amount of computing power being dedicated to it at this moment is severely disproportionate to what is needed to secure the network. This, in my opinion, reflects an overvaluation of the reward.
Like I said in my initial post here, I hope the dev core can replicate some of these innovations that altcoins are coming up with. I'm just not sure. Can Bitcoin's block time be shortened?

But if his friend thought were was only an extremely small chance that Bitcoin was going to hit $1000 then investing $1000 into it would essentially be a waste in his mind. Your method prevents the loss of any money, but it makes the friend's "win" essentially just a tie, which you wouldn't want if you believe there is a very low chance of it breaking $1000.

No one really knows. What can you do? It's likely that most who got scammed don't have enough cash to hire a lawyer and sue him. It also seems like no one cared enough to go knock on the guy's door. As of right now, he got away with it.
There's no way he got $100M though. The total amount he owed investors was substantially greater than the amount he actually had, which is why the ponzi collapsed. My guess is he was partying hard with other peoples' cash and took it almost down to 0 before closing up shop. He probably got a few thousand Bitcoins at most.

My point is that the unchanging reward makes it so that more people can jump in and be profitable as the value goes up. The fact that we're now seeing server farms doing the work that could be done on a single PC leads me to believe the currency is overvalued.

1. Faster block confirmation and block time I totally agree with. Although 2.5 minutes is still a bit slow for me. I think that using today's technology about 1 minutes is a safe, convenient number. In the future the confirmations should be even quicker though.
2. Scrypt I do not agree with at all. It makes the network use far more energy.
3. More coins means absolutely nothing.

This is why I like Peercoin. One would need to own 51% of the coins to perform a 51% attack, which would not only be prohibitively expensive, but the attacker would lose all of their wealth in the process.


The miners, apparently. I'm not sure if it's implemented yet, but Peercoin will have a 1% rate of inflation per year. If you own 100 PPC and let it sit for a year, at the end of the year you will have 101 PPC.
I actually do not own any PPC. (yet)

@_date: 2013-12-17 20:03:14
Why not just have faster confirmations? It seems like an unnecessary workaround.
A 51% attack against Bitcoin would be relatively easy for any entity with a large amount of money. Simply buy enough computing power and turn them all on. I've heard estimates of around $400M to 51% attack Bitcoin right now. Not out of the realm of possibility whatsoever.
Against a proof-of-stake coin, a 51% attack would require the attacker to own 51% of the coin, which would be exponentially more expensive. Supposing Bitcoin used proof-of-stake, that would require a very minimum of half the market capitalization (~$5B or so) to purchase half the coins. This figure would likely be astronomically higher as a purchase of 6M Bitcoins would push the price past Pluto.

Not sure, I'm US.


The most popular US exchanger (CoinBase) has a $0.10 minimum. I'd imagine it's similar in the UK.


That's up to you and only you. If you think Bitcoin is going to keep going up, then yes. If you don't think that it will keep going up, then maybe you shouldn't.


No one knows the answer to that. My opinion is that this growth is happening too fast. I believe in Bitcoin in the long-term, but I believe that this short-term growth will have to be corrected. Even if it does dip though, I think it will keep going up. The two major bubbles up to this point are disappearing in the rear view mirror in terms of the fiat exchange rate.

Trading fees don't stop anyone. 
Gox introduced fees years ago and before BTC China was big there were still gigantic price swings. The thing that makes me sick about this subreddit is that everyone blatantly displays their greed and puts in the most pathetic attempt to disguise it as benevolence.
You and I both know that every one of those posters isn't saying "Good." because they want Bitcoin to have a stable price, it's that they've found a scapegoat downswings (and their own loss of money) and they now believe it's being taken away.
It's really no wonder that tons of people who don't know much about Bitcoin think it's a ponzi, a pyramid, or a get-rich-quick scheme. Tons of people here are completely blinded by their own greed.
Yesterday was the worst day in Bitcoin's history. A major world power has come down hard on it. And all users have to say: "Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good."

1. Bitcoin's confirmation time can become problematic. I seriously hope that Bitcoin's dev core has the ability to change this, otherwise Bitcoin is going to be left in the dust. There are already coins with 20 second confirmations. Assuming this comes down in the future, Bitcoin will truly be archaic. Forget accepting zero-confirmation transactions: How about a confirmation within a second, and six full confirmations in 6 seconds.
2. The nature of mining bitcoins can (and possibly has already) become problematic. There is an immense amount of computing power and electricity being pumped into processing data that requires little computing power to process. If Satoshi could do it on his CPU in 2009, then why does it require warehouses full of dedicated hardware now? The amount of transactions needing to be processed has not increased accordingly. In my opinion, the rate of increase in the network's hashrate is directly proportional to the overvaluation of the currency. The fact that it's still profitable to compete with thousands of people who have spent thousands of dollars to process a very small amount of data leads me to believe that the currency itself is wildly overpriced. The mining community is currently paid about $40 to process each transaction the network broadcasts.
3. I am not sure I agree with the rate of inflation decreasing over time. There is a reason that most experts in the economic field favor inflationary currency. If bitcoins were to become the currency of the world, then no one would want to take on debt because they will end up having to pay much more down the road. Quote from wikipedia: Economists generally believe that deflation is a problem in a modern economy because it increases the real value of debt, and may aggravate recessions and lead to a deflationary spiral.
Let me be clear, I absolutely love the idea of cryptocurrencies and I am almost 100% sure that a decentralized digital currency is the future, but Bitcoin's implementation is a bit clunky, and I'm not sure it will be *the one*. Think MySpace.

Each confirmation on a blockchain that creates a new block every 10 minutes is surely more secure than a confirmation on a blockchain that creates a new block every minute.
However, having to wait up to 10 minutes just for one confirmation is incredibly inconvenient. I would much rather wait 5 minutes and get 5 confirmations than wait 5 minutes and have it still be at unconfirmed.
