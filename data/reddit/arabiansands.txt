No -- it's a new vehicle 
1) for the VEHICLE to exist - I need a critical mass of 10-20,000 coins-  logistically this needs to be done with a relatively small number of large holders 
2) once the vehicle does exist then anyone can participate with as little or as much as they want
Hope that makes sense

Thanks, I know, reddit is a lions den

It's not a matter of not valuing those who are not rich, it's about getting feedback from large coin holders on whether they personally see advantages of something which requires critical mass for larger adoption.   I understand the distrust of Wall St and I distrust them myself often.

Not looking to buy, it's more complex than that
@_date: 2014-01-02 21:40:17
The main advantage would be the potential premium as it's likely a fund would trade higher than the value of the BTC -- also for those who see some value in a portion of more mainstream asset, in brokerage statements etc.
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:01:49
Thanks it's not interest payments -- it's seeing if there are large holders who see a benefit in converting some portion of their holdings to a publicly traded vehicle (on a regular exchange) backed by the same BTC -- it could provide leverage as well as ability to borrow etc.  some don't see a benefit, some see it as a huge benefit. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:45:13

There does come a point when caution becomes paranoia -- it's warranted to some degree in the BTC world due to the nature of BTC --- but remember that the forbes list exists, there are public records of individuals who own more artworks than the value of 100,000 BTC etc. etc.   I understand the security but some people are going to buy stuff someday with their large holdings and over time people will be more well known.    In 2016 we may even see a forbes BTC rich list.....it doesn't necessarily   mean that members of that list will be killed by mafia ninjas though.  :)

@_date: 2014-01-02 17:51:16
The vehicle definitely would be offered to everyone....very easily and likely with NO minimum.
However, the initial starting process requires critical mass of 10-20,000 coins and a combination of regulatory issues as well as the logistics of dealing with 10,000 individual people with one coin each and each one having an agreement etc. would be the hurdles.
My lawyer says it should be 30 or less people.   In a perfect world, one or two of those people who have huge holdings of 100-400k+ would peel off a portion and participate to provide critical mass and also benefit themselves by a potential premium and by stabilizing the and growing the overall BTC market a bit.

OMG the people who go on this thread and randomly talk out their ass.
80% of these comments are total crap.
GAINS on BTC would be taxed as capital gains, either short term or long term gains depending on how long you held them
The taxable amount of the gain is the sale price minus the purchase price (if you did many trades then either all are calculated or the overall basis)
You buy $10,000 in coins in April, sell in November for $60,000 then you have a $50,000 capital gain (60-10).  You can also offset this with a loss.
You only have to pay taxes on coins you sell --- realized gains.   If you bought 10,000 coins for a buck and never sold any, you don't owe....yet.
No coins are not deductible, no there is not a limit on gains, no there is no $3000 a year carry over (that's for losses only), no it's not taxed as income in most situations.
People,, please don't just post random stuff about taxes if you don't actually know.
Also, get an accountant if you have anything more than $10,000 in gains -- keep it simple and don't let the accountant crew you into making it more complex than it is.

Well it would be backed by underlying bitcoin so the book value of those coins would never be less than the coins themselves....but investors might pay a premium for the ability to trade the vehicle publicly 
@_date: 2014-01-03 06:05:43
I'm not an accountant but I don't think so, no, not for the conversion and not unless they later sold the shares of the vehicle for fiat,  just like selling BTC for fiat is a taxable event 
@_date: 2014-01-03 00:17:06
I want to offer something with a lower threshold, the 3000 BTC isn't being snobby or exclusive it's about the practical realities of needing 10-20,000 in coins worth of interest to have enough critical mass to make it work.
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:46:17
yes, thats alot of the type of thing I'm thinking of -  some hurdles exist because of existing framework

For current BTC buyers, ease is not a factor--- but for millions of Americans it is---  I've dealt with a lot of investors for a long time and I'm telling you that the typical guy with money:  the retired dentist who loves in Florida, the guy who sold his plumbing supply co etc. is never ever going to buy BTC the way it is now with confusing numbers, keys, security, shady exchanges etc. -- if he can call the broker he's had at Merrill Lynch for 20 years and do so that's a whole different matter.
Also, a vehicle like this can be insured, reported, borrowed against and placed in tax differed accounts.

Interesting observation

No, there are many many types of vehicles and ways to do things -- I believe I have a superior way IMHO and I absolutely believe it would be far quicker and nearly certain to be listed without regulatory delays they have    -- Winkelvoss are smart and wealthy but new to the investment space -- Ive been in the industry much longer than they have  -  multiple ways to skin a cat
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:47:11
It's not a scam -- I have 20 years experience in the investment business and founded the Internet's first full service investment firm in 1994.  
I've personally done over $4.5 billion in transactions (roughly half the value of all Bitcoins in existence) and never had a single regulatory issue or customer complaint.  Ever.
Odd that people would make such a serious accusation with absolutely no evidence or reason other than that someone posted a request for advice and input on a forum.
I offered to verify and provide my real name, I'd be cautious of mud slingers who do not do the same.  Anyone accusing me of anything remotely resembling dishonesty should please reconsider the posts and perhaps delete them or come forth with some shred of evidence to that effect.

That's a common sentiment but those who think that suddenly companies like Google, Amazon and Apple who are all publicly traded as well as the huge institutions surrounding them will all collapse and die or even that this would be a good thing, might not have thought it through.

No, a public vehicle like an ETF or REIT, but IMHO superior to the ways others are looking at this.
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:10:01
Not exactly, big difference is that it would be a conversion not a sale, this is why some large BTC holders who want to keep the BTC exposure (as opposed to selling for cash to Fortress or BIT or something) find this appealing 
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:27:17
Because it's owe critically to see if there is viability and interest from enough large holdings to get the critical mass of 10-20,000 coins needed to make such a thing viable.   It's not a matter of knowledge but it can't be done logistically with thousands of small holders until it's launched and running.
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:01:45

The Winkelvoss ETF is not yet approved and who knows when it will be, if ever.  Secondmarket is not a public vehicle but a private placement and has a $25k minimum and required a PPM for investors, it can't be bought on an exchange.
I'm later to the party but have been working on this a while and the party has not really even started yet.  Someone will be the first to have a truly public vehicle like this, and it could be this one.

The vehicle I'm considering would enable large holders to potentially convert some portion of their holdings into a publicly traded vehicle -- I'm researching to determine how many people find that advantageous and how many do not-- some see little benefit, others see huge benefit depending on their personal situation and preferences, that is the research

That's not what I am asking
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:47:46
There are two concerns one is regulatory -- being already registered as an investment advisor, public communications are governed by regulations --- this is why you see almost no licensed or registered investment professionals on these types of forums publicly communicating.  If I am very specific and we do end up doing something and an offering of some sort which is regulated does come along then this could be considered a "communication with the public" for regulatory purposes.   I'm not trying to be cagey or vague--- it really is just early stage research.
Second is that we are already competing with several other players and I'd prefer to not provide tons of details to competitors.
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:25:37
There's a lot of assumptions in your post.   First off I am an early and huge believer in Bitcoin and a fairly early (I wish earlier!) personal investor.
I absolutely want to see BTC more mainstream --- it's a big deal now but still only a very,very tiny fraction of the overall economy/ Wall St. or even a good sized single retail mutual fund.
The vehicle I'm working on would enable every single person who has a brokerage account to be able to buy $50 worth of a Bitcoin backed vehicle, so it would accomplish what you are talking about.
I understand the desire to be outside the system -- but remember -- I know single people who have more flexible cash than the entire value of every Bitcoin in existence -- no matter how fast BTC grows those mainstream players and Wall St. are likely to be part of it just as print publishers became part of the online publishing phenomena.  
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:59:25
Well they can reply anonymously as well and clearly no one is under any obligation to reveal anything which they feel a risk.
I've disclosed my name, I'm easily verifiable, easily searchable on search engines - there is not much more I can do.
The reason for the limited information is because this is a public forum, we have competitors and also we are a very heavily regulated industry where every aspect of our communications with the public are closely regulated.  In fact, I can't think of any other investment professional who HAS identified themselves publicly on this forum.
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:59:32
@_date: 2014-01-03 06:57:35
Well you can either want BTC to become a real part of the economy and grown to $400 Bn plus OR you can want to exclude an industry because the government makes bad decisions.
I think it's very hard to have both -- individual adopters just won't drive up the price and the adoption ---  people who want to tell the VCs to go home so they can stick it to the man are not being realistic if they want BTC to be a signifying part of world commerce and the economy. 
For BTC to grow we need real capital invested, not $10k here and there, institutional money in the billions, me need real VCs to invest and bring their connections and know how and they in turn need cooperation with exit points and publc companies and IPO markets etc. we need adoption by companies like Google, Amazon and Apple all of whom are publicly traded on the evil exchanges by evil investment professionals.
I'd really be interested in hearing a plan on how to make BTC real without capital and without VCs and expertise and without public companies.
It's sort of like someone in 1990 saying "the web will take over man, it will destroy those scum bag news papers....therefor we don't want to deal with any writers, authors or editors or graphics people who worked for old media"

@_date: 2014-01-02 17:37:57
Bingo.  It is a huge opportunity -- a piece but not the main focus of the plan but absolutely -- I'd much prefer to work with people who already get BTC than to try to explain it to my colleagues who just learned how to use a blackberry last year.

No -- I founded the Internet's first full service investment firm in 1994 and I was user  on Facebook.

@_date: 2014-01-03 06:00:10
Because I'm not soliciting purchases....I'm not offering to buy peoples BTC, if I was that would be very simple and straightforward.
With this I believe I've come up with a superior vehicle relative to the other ones out there but it needs a certain critical mass to launch.
I'm not going into detail one because I'm in the investment business and do not want to provide info in a public forum which could be construed as any type of offer should a vehicle be launched and second because I don't want to share our plans with competitors.
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:54:10
Not outperform but trade at a premium.
Because people will pay a premium to easily access BTC related investments in a simple format they understand such as the brokerage account eve had for many years 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:55:09
I should specify public as in being on a public exchange --- right now you can't go to your Fidelity or Schwab or Merrill account and call the broker and say "Sell 100 shares Apple, buy 100 BTC" it will be a while before you can (perhaps years, perhaps never, certainly at least a year) --- that this would enable is the next best thing--- ability to buy from an exchange something totally backed by BTC --- similar to what Winkelvoss is working on but with what I believe are some significant advantages 
@_date: 2014-01-03 06:58:55
Do you think ETFs and more board adoption is harmful?   Do you want the price of BTC to never grow?
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:22:07
Yes, it's not about safety but the 1) potential premium a public vehicle would have 2) some (and only some) see advantages is having a portion of assets be more mainstream with standard statements, brokerage account borrowing etc. - some don't I know
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:14:26
What we are talking about isn't transactional -- but as I understand it there are technical methods of resolving issues with transaction limits and issues about the size of the Blockchain --  is it not already past 7 transactions a second in many cases?
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:17:34
- if I was to do a fund (and this is early and it's research and it's not an offering of any sort) my gut tell me the vast majority in BTC with a portion for trading BTC and a small portion for complementary BTC related investments and tech
- I don't think insurance companies get BTC yet so not sure if this is possible, clearly very good cold storage security
- I think that if BTC works over the coming five years, growth will be from appreciation not interest plans, after all, what could someone earn for interest anyway, not as much as the upside potential of the coins
- I think reading in an exchange would have to be USD for now
- yes, transparency would be key
- probably similar to other funds like metals or reits
- the same as other public funds
Again I'm not offering a fund and this isn't a solicitation -- I'm in research mode about some possible plans
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:32:16
Not sure I quite follow your example but basically it would be a process of a coin holder converting some coins to a public vehicle ALSO backed by coins -- so it trades generally in line with the market so could be in a brokerage account, traded on exchanges, in an IRA etc.
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:30:15
Because the vehicle I'm working on would enable large holders to convert some portion of their BTC to a publicly traded BTC vehicle --- it would only work for larger holdings for critical mass and logistics reasons--- so we are researching what level of interest there is from large holders in the viability of this.   Some think it's got no advantage, some think it's a huge advantage, depending in their situation.    I definitely value advice of everyone, small and large (or no) coin holders.
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:00:56
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:48:14
With this it wouldn't be a sale but a vehicle which could allow them to convert to the public vehicle....in SOME ways, have your cake eat it too
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:51:21
For some people there is no advantage of a public vehicle --
For some, some advantages are:
May trade at a premium to BTC 
Enables reporting on internationally recognized financial statements
Can be borrowed against
Can be insured
Can be placed in tax differed vehicles
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:55:53

I guess it's a common thing -- pretty discouraging -- I know Reddit is not a always place for serious and civil discussion but to make a post and be accused of being a scammer and being called scum for asking for input and advice doesn't seem productive.
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:51:18
No, a new publicly traded vehicle like an ETF or a REIT -- I believe I've developed a superior way to become listed with several advantages over an ETF but it needs critical mass first

this would be for people who see some value in having a mainstream security without losing out on the potential upside of bitcoin  -  just like every day some people convert to cash or whatever

Yes, for certain things....but mainstream banks will be years or decades away from that, if ever, even to THIS DAY they won't accept retirement accounts like IRAs as collateral for real estate loans because they cannot control the funds

I really will never understand reddit.   Why was this down voted?   That many people want regulation?
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:08:51
Well the upside would be almost exactly the same as the upside of Bitcoin since the new public investment would be Bitcoin backed.
Yes, security is a serious matter- we'd need to make sure the Bitcoin are cold stored, secured with solid security practices.....this is something Bitcoin Investment Trust or any major holder of coins would also need to do.

So you want it to be a hobby thing for a few tens of thousands of people - with no capitalists, no exchanges and no venture capital investments to expand things like coinbase?   Well have to agree to disagree then

Yes, upside and downside -- if BTC goes to a penny the fund would be worthless.
I'm liking at something different than Winkelvoss but I like their idea and see plenty of room for many entries into the market
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:05:36
It wouldn't be for you then --- we might not (if we even do this) even have such a swap....but if we did it seems the market might be someone who has say 5000 coins from being an early miner or lucky early buyer....but who doesn't have much other net worth....believes in BTC still and doesn't want to outright sell a large chunk...but likes the idea of having at least a portion of his funds in the mainstream system for purposes of reporting, insurance, collateral/ loans etc.

I disagree with those who say to charge money right away -- building connections and reputation is key and takes a lot of time...even for people already in the industry but especially for people outside the industry.
I've done projects for YEARS for free....sometimes hundreds of hours in exchange for the chance of long-term relationships and later work.  Some entire firms were started on spec like that and accepting clients for free.
A couple hour meeting here or there is standard and considered part of life and work for Wall St. people -- I recommend using that as an opportunity to build connections and reputation and then hope for a more full time gig.  
Another mistake I see often is people being too greedy "he has X" or "he will make X" there for Ill charge Y.   For example if a billionaire hedge fund owner asked for a list of the 500 top Bitcoin addresses some people might think they should charge 10k even though you can get the list simply by printing it from the web, that would be a mistake.   Charge a fair price, build reputation and build connections.

Yes, but there are some people who want a more mainstream access and trading system -  if you remove the Winkelvos and Bitcoin Trust and everyone else now resembling the "existing financial structure" the price goes back to $200 and will have a hard time increasing.   With mainstream adoption comes more mainstream access through existing financial systems:  banks, IRAs, brokerages etc.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:43:02
Not sure what you base that on.  Have you heard of Winkelvoss, Bitcoin trust and a huge number of hedge funds, financial professionals and very mainstream executives who've been buying over the last year?   This is a huge reason for the increase in price.   People with a million dollars or more to invest affect the price FAR more than groups of small investors buying $29 worth of BTC and almost all of the newer investors placing those $1000+ orders are mainstream investors.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:27:26
Agree or disagree?

How about you keep half your "spending money /cash" in cash at an exchange and then instantly buy bitcoin whenever you make a purchase?

Cool, mine are younger....tried to get the babysitter to take a portion of pay in BTC but she wasn't going for it.  :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:19:09
I know that is speculation....I just saying that volalility and price run ups, in and of themselves are not proof that it's not real.
In other words this statement is meant as a counter to the argument "Bitcoin is not serious because it's run up so much and is so volatile."
IF it is real - just as the title says IF....and that's a big IF....this is probably pretty much what it would look like....does that prove Bitcoin is it?  Nope, but doesn't prove it isn't either.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:01:58
Where do you think the investors come from?   Not sure if you really have thought this through but -- simple question -- do you think that the Winkelvoss investment and the Bitcoin Trust and the bullish reports by. Merrill Lynch and the investment yesterday by Andreesen Horowitz are BAD things or good things for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:50:27
I have a friend who is a billionaire and I feel a little bad for him when everyone on earth asks for free money...he can't use the white lies of "I don't have it right now", "I'm on a budget for this project" etc.    good problem to have, but funny nonetheless

I think that was 1-2 weeks ago, I wrote this on the 25th of Nov. - I think it was in Dealbook - I remember reading a few articles on the $150 mm.
The part about MtGox was one I edited for the blog also--- in my original email I called MtGox a "joke" but took this out because I don't want to give the wrong impression
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:57:54
Exactly, no bank will accept that as collateral...probably ever... unless someday they make a system where you give them the codes

One of the obstacles for more Bitcoin adoption is lack of opportunities like this that integrate well with the existing financial structure.

Imagine if Bitcoin Trust was a public mutual fund and you could trade $100k worth of Bitcoin for $100k worth of Bitcoin trust

Sort of,  they are working to set up an ETF which would be publicly available -- but I'm not aware they are offering shares in exchange for Bitcoin

So much misinformation on this thread I'm taking the time to set some things straight:
- this is not direct Bitcoins, that was never a possibility - the article title was badly done
- this is only referring to the Secondmarket investment fund, this is different than coins
- that fund is NOT a normal retail mutual fund but is only opened to accredited investors who meet the annual income and net worth requirements - this is separate from Fidelity's lower account minimums -- you STILL would need to meet both the accredited investor requirement AND the fund minimum 
- no, Fidelity will not count as the investor and resell the shares or split them up etc. that's not how it works, ever -- investors in alternative investments like this must be the actual investor and must meet the accredited criteria
- the accredited investor issue is due to the SEC and other regulations - it's not the fault or choice of the investment industry - believe me if we could simply and legally offer a Bitcoin investment we would

So you don't see a difference in importance and adoption if the price is at $1000 versus if it had stayed at $1?   If it was still at $1 then we'd have a very different environment now, this would be a smaller forum and we'd have less sophisticated mining, less merchants accepting and almost no media coverage and very few new companies coming online.   I was at Bitcoin conference this week and I can't imagine that a single one of the 500 attendees feels like price is irrelevant, we all want Bitcoin to succeed, be widely adopted and rise in value and see more VC investments, more mainstream interest.   I can't think of anyone in the audience who would have disagreed ...unless they were a Federal agent.

I did a quick search, couldn't find articles, remember at the time--- early 90s there was talk of this (also a couple unfounded hoaxes).
I may be wrong but I seem to remember efforts to do this by those who wanted a piece of email revenue since it was seen as a threat to snail mail.
I dont think these efforts went anywhere, not due to lack of trying, but due to inability to be able to do so

No, penny stocks are a different category....but banks who do loan on securities don't care what the business is or what the security is backed by or owns or it's book value etc....they only care about the market value.   Some stocks after all don't have any real assets to speak of, the entire value coming from hope of future R&amp;D or something.   Banks do not have analysis who get into the business of deciding if one security is better than another or if Google has a good business model or if an agricultural company has too much land or a biotech can cure cancer or whatever.   They look at the symbol, value and the brokerage statement that's it.

It will be interesting to see how collecting taxes in a case like this could be done.
Suppose someone who is on the top 20 bit coin owner list died today with instructions or a printed key for his spouse?   What do you think would happen tax wise?   We'd be talking equivalent of $50 million perhaps 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:58:11
Yes, just thankful I'm no longer a FINRA member or I would not even be allowed to speak about Bitcoin let alone by email, blog or reddit!
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:55:15
We wouldn't give loans --- we'd trade your Bitcoin for a publicly traded security also backed by  Bitcoin which should perform pretty close to  Bitcoin.
With that publicly traded security you could get loans from any number of lenders who take securities as collateral (while almost none actually take  Bitcoin directly)
Sort of like if you traded your Bitcoin for equal value of Google stock or the Schwab XYZ Fund....Only this investment would also be Bitcoin related.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:14:26
Did you ever use a bank to buy Bitcoin or accept proceeds from sale of Bitcoin?
If Bitcoin goes to $40,000 per coin it will still only be about 1% of world transactions....so there will be some people who have desire or need to do some transactions with the other 99%..... real estate borrowing, working with other public stocks etc.  
Hopefully BTC does well but unless it reaches $4 million per coin and takes over the whole world, not everyone will have this need or desire to interact with the rest of the financial system,  but some will
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:32:48
Banks will not accept Bitcoin keys as collateral, but many, almost all of them, accept publicly traded securities as collateral -- they only care about the value of the security, not what the company does

The advantages would be that it would be placing a portion of assets in a more mainstream account type.
That doesn't appeal to some but for others it's an advantage.  
Especially for early adopters who have thousands of coins --  advantages include being able to easily trade with other securities (sell Bitcoin fund, buy AAPL, sell that buy back Bitcoin fund),  ability to borrow, ability to use as collateral, provide proof of net worth, statement for home loans etc.
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:56:54
Yes, some may not have it be an advantage -- for others its an advantage to have it in a mainstream account type for loan, collateral purposes, financial statements etc.

Thanks -- I was a solider, then contractor, then private citizen, I've been going to Muslim countries for 15 years, have been to every single country in the Gulf and have lived in two different Muslim countries....so I'm familiar....just saying that popular press is full of misconceptions.   We can see this by looking at solid stats and number of terrorist activities -- compared also with other religions: Lords Resistance Army in Uganda, Catholic Protest issues in Northern Ireland, Slobodan Milosovec, Anders  Brevik etc.

I'm aware of that but for widespread adoption it seems that thinks like the VC investment in coinbase are a benefit and that some people seeing it as a store of wealth as well.
Right now all bitcoins on earth have less than half the value of Inktomi, a failed dot com stock....and that doesn't even adjust for inflation.   People who believe in Bitcoin don't see it as another Pets.com but as something that is potentially transformative and disruptive technology....for it to be disruptive, some people need to see it as mainstream.   This is why exchanges exist and trade in recognized dollars....without them the price would be far lower when quoted in USD....you may not care about USD price because it defeats your idea of the purpose of BTC but you'd be in the minority.

Better yet, an opt in that allows you to specify that NO withdrawals can occur at all and if any are attempted it locks the account and reports it to your phone and their security people.
You could unlock the opt in withdrawal block with some extra layers of security or passwords etc.
