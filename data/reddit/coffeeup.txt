They said it was inspired by threes.

Exactly. People say that they will "never be as big as Bitcion".
That's ok by me - if they become worth even a decent fraction of what Bitcoin is worth, I'll be content.

LTC and PPC are probably going to compete for the backup seat for the next few years - with LTC being most probable to be the 2nd to BTC.
Though, both LTC and PPC have gone completely bonkers over the last week (last week LTC was ~$8, today is ~$27  -  PPC was ~$1, today is ~$3.5 to $4).
Now, regardless of whether the current price is due to the market being flooded with speculative PO's, or if this is gonna be a short pump-and-dump type scenario is anyone's guess (I'm not selling any of mine).
Just remember: Bitcoin has had it's volatility over the last few years, the same will happen to any altcoin that *may* wind up being another front-runner. And that is still anyone's guess.  $13 was a great deal for BTC back in the day (hindsight being 20-20), so paying $27 or $3.5 for a speculative currency over the next 3 - 5 years? Worth it to me.
Too many altcoins are still in the penny-stock stage of life (low cost, high speculation, little track record).
Whatever you decide to also invest in - if you decide to invest/speculate - be prepared to potentially lose it. But more importantly, learn to "forget" about it for the next 2 to 5 years. If you're constantly monitoring/second guessing yourself, you're gonna lose out, ultimately.
Investing is gambling over the long term - know that there will be winners and losers in this game, and we're all trying to figure out who that is ;)
