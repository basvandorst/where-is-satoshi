Man, whatever you think, saying shit to him now isn't really gonna make it better. Be a lil fucking considerate

Or maybe newbies can learn from something like this. I ain't talking about donating at all. The fact someone's had a bad day and you don't have to make it more painful by being a smart Alek on how they should have secured their funds. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:20:16
Dollar cost average. It's always good to buy when it dips. Spread your money out. 
Personally, I would buy 20 to 40% of it now and spread it out. Good luck
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:45:30
Heh what he said was not so off the mark. Look at the amount of gold Indians buy. India is one of the largest consumer of gold and there's a story there.

Nah, American love for tech is vastly known. There are arcticles on Bitcoin,sure. Not on American specific news per se. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:09:45
Correct. YouTube might have videos, check
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:12:25
Well..maybe have a friend who's on diff shore and you guys can have a setup of him buying and you selling. 
Actually that's a neat idea if you guys can pull off

The awkward moment when your employer is  mentioned 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:10:20
Most folks would suggest you to hold unless you need some money now. What's the point of selling it when the market is down and has the potential to go up? The risks are minimal when compared to hanging on to it and see where it lands. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:27:32
Nope. It's a decent paying job and I don't think everyone in the industry is bad. Bad apples sure, thats not gonna change my view of what I do as a day job.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:55:43
Thank you for your efforts pieter!

Maybe it's picking up trezor from last connection time? Rebooting might help?

Sorry to hear this man. Hey at least you have a girlfriend! Good luck

Lol this isn't a Bollywood movie to start with. It's a Telugu film. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:15:53
Right on! Same thinking
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:35:38
Not Bollywood, it's a Telugu -regional language - film 
@_date: 2018-08-25 07:41:25
Good luck!
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:48:02
No one knows and that's the only right answer

Thank you for everything you do Nicolas. Continue to rock!

@_date: 2018-08-15 09:12:06

@_date: 2018-05-24 06:52:36
Am keeping calm and holding! This shit happens too regularly to panic

Heh is that a rhetorical question? If it's not, am not sure what you're doing in markets
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:56:51
Here's the actual reason : no one knows. Anything else is bull 
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:21:50
It's fine for me 
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:51:18
Agreed but for non traders, I believe that's the best option. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:08:32
Your spirit is amazing! You'll come back strong and kill it buddy. I would've been fucking gutted if not more if I lost 70k. Your attitude towards this is absolutely inspiring!
I'm sure you'll come back strong, leave alone hoping.

That's quite a steep climb for 2020. Not really sure that gonna happen, good luck in reaching your moon though! Let's hope for the best
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:40:47
Thank you for this
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:32:59
Hang in there tight. I hope we get there soon

It's only available for few states in the u.s and am not sure if folks who are waiting in line realise that 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:02:00
Shhhh! Just don't come with logics
I personally believe this drop is due Merkel getting elected again.

Imagine santoshi listening to this while sipping a margarita with a umbrella in the glass. This has come so far since the white paper.  
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:44:38
In dips, yes
@_date: 2019-01-13 08:36:48
Nice! 
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:58:27
Just hold and sit tight! That's all I do and am positive
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:10:35
Can confirm, just woke up and not selling
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:57:18
Hang on to it!
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:22:38
It sounds ok so far.

@_date: 2018-02-20 02:22:42
I guess getting 1 btc will be difficult for most.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:37:21
1. Market manipulation
2. I bought below the sell figure and want to play it safe 
3. Sell now as I got it less than the dropping value and buy as it continues to dip - 1 btc becomes 1.10 if I'm right in thinking this selling will continue and can get more
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:03:23
Half of this sub wouldn't know this news , leave alone average Joe. We should stop relating news to drops and highs, especially this kind 
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:09:53
Working fine for me
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:24:07
No. It's easy to get swayed with all this hoopla and gains. The reality is we will only buy a lambo when we sell and no one's sure if that will happen.
Better to have what you can into crypto and enjoy the gains than losing every penny you have. Pls don't get fooled by lambo bullshit
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:49:05
Spend few weeks on reading this sub and then invest what you can lose.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:30:50
I can, but you will lose money. Same with anyone guessing. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:28:40
If btc is gonna go up, yes. You're buying more btc with the profits 
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:35:44
Buy --&gt; send to trezor = good 
Buy --&gt; leave on the website you bought from =bad 
Buy --&gt; save in your own software wallet - you can but you need to ensure system has no malware 
Best software wallet - 
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:06:47
Everyone who's running it on their systems. Hence it's decentralized
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:59:05
That means nothing. Folks like me dish out a new ID every few months
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:28:11
Yup. If the u.s does anything which might be viewed as negative to btc, we're fucked across the world. Let's see how this plays out
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:52:18
Solid stuff right here!
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:21:24
This genuinely made me feel good.
Good luck and hope it happens soon

Can anyone pls tell me how to claim bcash from electrum with settings of trusted coin? With 2fa enabled?
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:22:47
Hang in there! Rescue on its way
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:47:16
Am kind at crossroads on that. These folks have no clue on what this is but neither do 90 percent of average Joes. I don't think we should hold that against these folks..if anything, I appreciate how these are going about it. They aren't dismissing the technology and fwiw, that's a good step 
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:52:39
You mean buy alts when low and sell to gain more btc?
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:51:30
Decentralized, regulation is not a bad word, it makes it mainstream infact. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:47:21
Good one 
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:22:24
Yes, but honestly the thought that Asia woke up and not selling is silly. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:44:00
Or people create new IDs to play safe...heh
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:54:55
Sidebar should help. Pls don't invest into stuff you don't understand, and I mean it..
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:03:44
Yeah she's also vocal about banks, isn't she? Saw many videos where she's picking on banks and rightly so. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 19:55:27
Best kept secret in crypto : big financial institutions are already in. Go ahead and sell if you want but take a moment to reflect on yearly price. If it's quick money you were looking for, stocks are your best bet. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-07-20 09:21:46
Not vergebut corda.

@_date: 2018-04-13 09:15:09
? Asking someone to wait till this price cools down or buy in dips to dca is bad advise?
What are you talking about mate?
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:08:22
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:13:01
It moved15% up in the last 24 hours. I'd wait or buy in dips 
@_date: 2018-07-21 16:38:19
So glad to see this. Well done and congrats!
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:11:31
Congratulations dude. Glad it worked out for you
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:19:53
Hahaha that made me smile. Well done!
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:45:00
Made me smile! Well done mate 
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:24:56
Exactly what am thinking!
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:50:11
That's a cheap shot. Space agency of India has been doing an amazing job if I ain't wrong
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:26:16
There are so many analusys in this very sub.. we don't need anyone else to say that! Heh
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:20:02
Leave Reddit and chill. Don't sell at a loss.
@_date: 2018-04-02 07:55:24
Mostly it does from my experience

Don't think holding lights is the main point here...
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:51:29
Lol you should look up on what Indians think of that aid. Am not sure you know  how this aid works..read up. World news sub has been on this forever 
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:31:04
That made me chuckle
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:24:09
You care lil a about to ask someone for a link to read and waste time on it?
UK folks should stfu and stop giving aid if it's pinching you so much. Quit whining
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:40:46
Calm down man. Not everyone is fortunate enough and am sure you'd agree, we can be a lil patient with new folks. He ain't asking for money, is he
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:38:35
Umm not sure if I should break this news while you being happy about this rally
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:03:27
Agreed. If there's one thing I learnt it's this, not to let emotions take over. Going up? Good..going down? Hang on rather than selling it for loss.
