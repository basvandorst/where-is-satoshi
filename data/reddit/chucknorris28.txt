So the Tether collapse is probably pushing Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies back upwards, since everyone is trying to sell it back for coins? Guess not that many "experts" could see that coming.

People try to sell Tether (which is mostly used on Bitfinex).

In case you missed it: you are already living in this world, and I would always prefer a world with several super powers over a world with the one "chosen". That's what triggers your politicians and corporations - suddenly they have to share the cake with other superpowers, and not the "ally" vassals.
And that's why your view on China (and probably Russia as well) is a complete paraphrase of US mainstream media agenda, as you probably never had other sources to learn about their system, living conditions and politics.
Besides that, at least China never tried to hide it's censorship and police state procedures. Whereas the US does sexactly the same (discredit anti governmental opinions, spy on its citizens and even "ally governments"), but proclaiming to be the heaven of democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and so on. Hypocrisy circus.

The benefit is you bringing more USD value into BTC, even after spending some of them. The point is not missing, since you are buying goods with Bitcoin and usually you are getting a good discount because of the transaction and exchange fees. It only would be pointless if the seller then converted it back to USD. In this case only exchanges would profit.

Isnt it what everyone of us is in for? Break the hegemony of the petro dollar, which would significantly damage US and prevent them from playing the police all around the globe?
The FED is printing money like no other, and is used to deny credits for countries who are trying to establish independent politics, especially emerging countries. The US are using it as a weapon, to discourage nations from takind it own steps. Bitcoin is one of the solutions to eliminate this unfair advantage.

So what? Who cares about the dollar price when its not the "world currency" anymore? It could be Zimbabwezian dollars in the same way. Pay with every crypto or fiat you like, no need to value everything in those shitty dollars - that would literally liberate the world from slavery. Kicking out Dow Jones companies from dirt poor countries without uncle Sam's debt financed war machine knocking on your door.
