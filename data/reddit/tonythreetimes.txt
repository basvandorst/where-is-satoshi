You can't just 3d print a car though, that's not possible. Do you know anything about cars? You can 3d print just very basic things, not cars. You need lots of workers to build a car. Robots do a lot but you still need a lot of people involved, that's why factories exist. 
Also, who's going to do the incredibly difficult labor of farm work? There's still currently no machines that can do all the farm work, it's incredibly labor intensive.
Or are you just imagining all of this possible in the future when AI and robots exist that can do all the labor in a post-scarcity world?

Lol no offense dude but you have no idea what you're talking about. There wouldn't be enough farmers doing terribly difficult labor all day if nobody got paid and could get everything for free. 
There would be no food and everyone would starve to death. 
Is this why all the people starved under past socialist/commie regimes? This is starting to make a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:56:50
So all of this is dependent on robots doing all the work in the future? 
So none of it is realistic with today's means?

Who would make the things you need if everyone just got everything for free already? Nobody would work to produce the things. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:57:21
On fiverr. Just like a funny sketch or something. Check the site out. Easy to make 5 bucks. Do that a few times a day, no problem. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:48:50
Lol yeah naturally awesome things like hang out on the beach or go travelling and other fun stuff like spending time with your family and not working in a factory 10 hours a day producing deodorant for everyone. There would be no "things" to give everyone for free if everyone got everything for free. Producing things is not very glamorous or "awesome" and nobody would make them. 
You're completely misunderstand human nature to suit your want to not have to work and to get free stuff. 
You could just go work in a factory right now if you think it's "awesome" and "useful" and what humans would naturally be doing if they could do anything they want in life. So your life goals are now accomplished, you don't even need socialism anymore. Heck, with what they pay you in money at the factory, you can even buy all the things you need, so you don't need them to be free. Shockingly, this all works out well in a functioning society, hahahaha!

Bruh they can just hop on fiverr, do a few gigs that day like drawing a sketch or making a funny video. Easy $30 per day or so, probably would only take a couple hours. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:14:20
I'd stick with the drawings then, uses a lot less bandwidth. And there's always the local library if you're having trouble with your home wifi. Of course, you can't make any loud funny videos in a library so another reason to go with the funny drawings. Probably would throw up a gofundme too just in case and mow some lawns in the neighborhood, I get like $20 a pop for that from my neighbors but I don't know what the going rate is there for lawn care.

So who will make the cars when i want a free car? Robots can't make cars all by themselves, they need tons of factory workers.

So who does the incredibly intensive human labor of farming that nobody would want to do, to get all the free food?

So who's going to work in the factories doing mindless terrible jobs? No, not robots. You've obviously never been to a factory, not everything is done by robots.

Yep Yang is cool af. There's a lot of good communities here if anyone wants to check him out more. 
to get you started, there's also links in the sidebar to every other major Yang sub.

I used to tell this to my mom all the time. No shit I failed out of college after two semesters. I didn't want to go in the first fucking place. Not that I couldn't. I've been non-stop told my entire life that I had the potential to do whatever I want, by many teachers and others in academic fields. But I'm not going to let some douchebag "professor" tell me when and where to be, and fucking judge me. 
Never went to class. Mom got fucking pissed. When we got the letter that I wouldn't be allowed back I laid it out on the kitchen table. Smiled. Told her to read it. Asked her "Where did your money go, telling me to do shit I didn't even want to do?" She told me some bullshit about my "future" not knowing wtf she was talking about. I explained to her that blockchain *is* the future and then came the crocodile tears. I went to my room not giving a fuck. I had some gaming to do anyways. 
We don't talk much anymore and family dinner is awkward af for her but not me, because I actually know wtf I'm doing. It's going to be funny when she comes around asking for a handout. The answer will be the same as when I asked her for a car. "Not until you show me you can be responsible." So fucking never lmao.

Well luckily a lot of governments are coming out with new regulation procedures as we speak if you think they're necessary. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:13:29
You have to be open to the future and adapt. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:09:38
You're welcome. And I agree wtf. If you get accused of a crime you get a lawyer for free. If ur trying to make something right legally, you've gotta pay more than what the settlement would even be worth. Where the fuck are the government-subsidized lawyers? How can the average person even find justice if it costs more than what they would receive? 
I have a feeling that eventually blockchain will fix this, cutting out the unnecessary middleman fees, but wtf are we supposed to do until then?  
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:28:17
I've looked into that actually, I've been trying to sue bitcoin. But from everything I've read it's not very easy. 
I'd recommend getting a lawyer but the cost of the lawyer can actually cost MORE than the amount you lost in the first place. Which is pretty fucking stupid.

I don't really go to restaurants and my mom cuts my hair so no big deal. Groceries will be ordered online and delivered to your house through the blockchain, there's already a lot of options for grocery delivery. You can even get restaurant meals delivered nowadays if you really want something from a restaurant. 
Once they start using the blockchain itll cut out the expense of the middleman and you get your stuff quicker and cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:20:59
I was talking to some friends about this exact thing recently, actually. And no, it turns out if you want to diversify, you'd probably be better off grabbing some alt coins that are promising or have low prices currently, and spread out your portfolio that way. I wouldn't worry about market cap, I don't think anyone truly understands it or that it matters anyways.  Use (expensive) btc as your base and branch out into cheaper cryptos from there. 
There's no reason I can see to put money into dinosaur investments. Dat shit already be extinct.

Whoever's holding tether will be screwed. Who's holding all this tether anyways? I don't get how the price doesn't fluctuate with demand. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:12:29
The US economy will probably increase as market cap of crypto keeps increasing, it'll just be a different economy based on the blockchain. And what you're talking about are service workers basically, not traditional dino businesses. Yeah we'll still need cops and stuff but that's not a business you invest in. 
A plumber would be needed to, but cost would decrease because of the blockchain so both people win. People will be less homeless than before, what are you talking about? And they'd even be able to invest in crypto too so they'll have more money than they did before. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:32:44
Yeah, those are dinosaur businesses though, and won't last past 2020, maybe 2021. They're paying pensions out to old timers who worked on a factory line making analog goods 50 years ago that millennials aren't buying. The majority of profits are probably propping up 1950s consumerism, which has nothing to do with 2018. 
Get with the times, modernize, and be a part of the future. Or go bankrupt along with 99% of dinosaur businesses. A couple will stay open if they incorporate blockchain, like snap, apple, tinder, google. But that's only if they choose to modernize and not be left behind in the dust. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:00:01
That's like all of economics though lol
