I disagree. Donations are made with the (legally enforceable, IRL) expectation that the funds will be used for a purpose consistent with the charity's purpose. I'm not suggesting the forum donation pool is a charity, and the objectives of the fund were admittedly vague, but it's not enough to say the donations were a gift and thus beyond accountability.

I wonder if the seller has a mortgage, or if she has enough cash on hand to pay it off before being able to access the sale proceeds. If not, it'd be interesting to see how the conveyancing lawyer structures things to do the bitcoin conversion in a way that allows her to discharge the existing mortgage based on an undertaking to convert the bitcoin and send a portion of the CAD proceeds to the mortgagee.

Thanks for the reply, and congrats on breaking some new ground here. As a (non-real estate) lawyer myself, I'd be very interested to know what mechanism ends up getting used to handle the conveyancing if the buyer ends up buying in BTC.

With NH's significant role in US primary elections, maybe its progressive approach to Bitcoin will coax presidential hopefuls to take The Bitcoin Pledge in the run up to the 2016 elections -- to the moon!

Trying to picture what that insurance product would look like.  If there were Bitcoin put options or futures contracts available for sale, I suppose those could factor into a solution. What do agents do when the purchase price is payable in a different currency than the mortgage?

I was following one of the 790k deposits made to that wallet and was able to trace it back to a wallet with over $15M - that got its initial funding from the same wallet address you posted. Very intriguing.

It's essentially the process of transferring property between a buyer and seller. A notary or lawyer typically handles everything from verifying the "charges" that are registered against title to the property, transferring funds, registering ownership by the buyer, etc. 
Where I live (British Columbia), the purchase price gets paid into an account managed by the seller's conveyancing lawyer/notary, sometimes on the lawyer's promise that the funds will be used to pay off any existing mortgages. What intrigued me about introducing the BTC element into the conveyancing process is that the conveyancing lawyer can only promise to use the funds in a certain way once he or she has guaranteed access to the funds. Usually the funds are "guaranteed" because they arrive in the form of a bank draft or a trust cheque from another lawyer (who is bound by similar promises). It seemed to me that if the purchase price is being paid in Bitcoin, the lawyer wouldn't be able to give the promise to pay off the mortgage until the Bitcoin had been converted into local currency. After all, if the value of Bitcoin plummeted before it was exchanged or there wasn't enough liquidity to convert it right away, the conveyancing lawyer might not be able to make good on the promise to pay off the mortgage. If there's any chance the promise can't be honoured, the promise wouldn't be made -- hence the need for a more complicated than usual process for holding the purchase funds (including any mortgage funds being lent to the purchaser) in escrow.

I had found the custom link and defaults on the web site, but I was using my Android app this time. There, the custom send feature let me enter a fee, but it seemed to be rejecting it if I entered all zeroes, so I kept moving the decimal over to the right with a trailing one until it would accept a fee that I could cover from my balance.

Thanks, I'll try looking at bridgewalker. I hadn't thought of Bitcointip. Since the coin was in my blockchain.info wallet, wouldn't I need to move the balance to bitcointip first (and hit the same fee obstacle) anyway?

I suspect this is just a broker desperately trying to create a buzz by riding the coattails of Bitcoin's media attention. Presumably the premium being charged by the seller or his agent for accepting payment in BTC is sufficiently significant to absorb the currency risk as the value fluctuates throughout the escrow process. This is like saying I'll accept bitcoin for any random service or product I'd otherwise sell in fiat currency. Sure I would: if you'll give me 2-3x the current MtGox trade value!

Makes sense. But until the BTC value stabilizes or a derivatives market gets established, this would only make sense for Wal-Mart if they could hammer out a deal with a payment processor that would exchange into fiat currency at a discounted rate.
What would be brilliant is if Wal-Mart took the projected cost savings to Visa and MC and used the math to extract a comparable discount from them on credit card transaction fees.

Congrats on your win. If you hold some of them, it could end up paying for the college of your choice, or at least a few beers while you're there.
Incidentally, where does blockchain get bitcoin to give away? I feel this may be a stupid question, yet I'm having difficulty guessing the answer.

Post-WWI Germany had a great solution: pay people every day.

Point taken, but this doesn't change how unextraordinary this "news" is. It's still kind of like saying "I'll sell you my flat in Manhattan for gold bars, or euros, or gas." It would have been *more* interesting if the seller agreed, in advance of sale, to accept a fixed amount of Bitcoin for the property.

So many bitcoins because they're personally wealthy, or because Blockchain itself generates revenue?
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:24:39
25 currently, but that goes to whomever mined the new block. I was trying to figure out how blockchain.info itself generates any revenue such that it would have money to give away of its own. The closest we seem to have come to from the discussion in this thread is that the founders of blockchain used their personal wealth to fund this prize, in which case kudos to them.

Depends on how much you bought and sold it for. In Canada, at least, there's a minimum threshold such that you don't have to report a capital gain on personal use property (like a couch) if you bought and sold for $1000 or less:

Looks like it would take 155 days to break even at current difficulty using their bulk rates. Probably better to just donate to someone who promises not to use Ghash.io.

Thanks. Does that mean that if I include a 0.0001btc fee on any transaction, it should get confirmed reasonably soon (within an hour?) I'll have to go back and check to see whether the "low" fees I accidentally used in the past were lower than that - I've definitely had my share of decimal screwups - sadly sometimes in relation to satoshi dice!
