I prefer to have apps and features.  I've tried Ubuntu mobile, not ready for primetime.

Thinking about trying this...
I'm currently downloading the blockchain torrent.  if this isn't confirmed by tonight, then i'll try deleting the unconfirmed transaction and resending.

You make it seem like bitpay would be easier.  The easiest way is to create a wallet and leave a static address.

Circle app sucks.  Mobile Web is better
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:07:50
I don't like that option because I don't know what price I'll buy the BTC for.  I want to buy them now, at the price now, not in 3 days, at the price then.
This reason will prevent me from ever using this exchange, unless its resolved.

credit unions DO allow business accounts.  I have one now for my Tie Dye business, and i'm about to open one for my bitcoin startup.  I plan to approach them this week to get written confirmation of their acceptance.

If you're in the us, I don't think coinbase requires an id.  I use it all the time and don't remember uploading.  I could be wrong though

I live in the Dayton area.  My insurance agency take Bitcoins :)
I also tried accepting Bitcoins at a garage sale, no takers.

Hey, I know you!

My price is Coinbase + 6%.
That's less than sales tax here in Ohio.

Especially be skeptical of skepticism of confirmations

My daughter sells girl scout cookies, and due to the bad weather this year, she didn't have a chance to walk the neighborhood. We just ordered a ton and are trying to sell them now.
We have several cases of each kind, and I'm willing to sell them for bitcoins.  We're in the Dayton, OH area, but can ship if you pay shipping.
Pm me if your interested. :-)

Localbitcoins.  Very easy.
I'm a seller on there and I can say it's the easiest way for a beginner to get some btc.

Correct does not mean anti-Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:46:59
This sounds nice, I just signed up for early access.
What I really want to know is how long it takes for coins to clear.
@_date: 2014-09-17 00:34:00
Sounds interesting...  What were you thinking of using as the core software?
I have a vps, and a small hosting company.  I might be able to provide the hosting backend.

It's because of money servicer law BS.  Google doesn't want to get caught in the middle.  It's unfortunate, but doesn't indicate Google hating bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-12 20:43:19
I hope not!
I send 0 fee transactions every once in a while, and i've never had one take over 24hrs.
Just my luck...  I've got these ppl hounding me about getting their transactions confirmed, and there nothing i can do.  resending won't work, as everything is jammed.  all my coins are locked up behind this stupid .08 btc transaction.

Check It out, it was enough for me to switch from ghash a month ago.
They use double geometric payment method which seems really nice, with some pps shares that you earn on the side.  Plus it merge mines.
 1.5%fee, but that's next to nothing.
The only problem is the long delays between blocks.
WE NEED MOAR POWA!!

To a beta testnet.  The testnet must stay the same as bitcoin core, so devs can test things.  No point screwing everyone up by changing things on just one side...
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:41:43
Thanks!

If you're looking for anonymous, then try localbitcoin.  You can do a local meetup, or bank deposit.  No id required
@_date: 2014-07-07 22:31:06
That defeats the purpose of anonymity.  Noone will take credit card or bank draft without identification for fraud purposes.

I applied for an invite but didn't get one
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:48:10
I mean how long after a purchase do I get the coins.  Circle takes about 3 days, Coinbase takes 4.
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:56:51
The cc data breaches are ONLY issues because the cc companies refuse to implement security on the cards.  If there was a 2 factor code on the card that changed home depot wouldn't have any data worth stealing.
The "victims" are the credit card companies, they are victim to an issue they could have seen coming in the 90s, and we're supposed to be outraged that they left the screen door open and someone walked in and stole the tv.

I think he's referring to the fact that relatively upstanding people ran some of the older ones.  They got arrested, and the new owners seem to have less scruples in general
