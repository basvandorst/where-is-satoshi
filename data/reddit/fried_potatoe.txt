Ethereum team is dumping the 26k btc. They're a long-term competitor anyways :D

I think actually the trade within is what makes this good. Using Halo (I dont use it yet), I see bitcoin as some sort of mutual insurance policy. It might not be a good way for outsiders getting in, but it's a very good way of smart contracting / making deals between two parties that both have btc.
And Halo seems to be a niche (because people trust each other), not something that would be like AOL lol

I did.
I think when any digital currency has real world usage, it will have value from there.
BlackCoin stands a good chance, with the fast transaction speeds and low network maintenance requirements.

That paper is terrible xD it assumes the coins are worth nothing in the first place, and you need a lot to attack the network.
So basically it says buy enough coins to perform the attack to make them worth nothing. Try it on NXT, will cost u 25m $ to perform this attack? :P
