Don’t think they sell it in 1 second increments. Your best bet is a 15 sec slot, or about 2.5 mil.

Sigh. Now I’ll have to move everything to fiat ��. Siiiiiiiiiike! Just won’t use Coinomi!

But what about Potcoin? Da blockchain for pot that Dennis Rodman promotes.

When I was in da US I had to go thru 19 banks before one of them granted me da right to open a bank account. I am American. 
In hindsight, maybe I was doing g something wrong because it shouldn’t take that long. But I’ll jump on the train anyway, screw da banks!! Down with fiat!
