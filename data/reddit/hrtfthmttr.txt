You're kidding me, right? Has there *ever in the history of bitcoin* been anything less surprising than the constant thieving, selfishness, and general disdain for fellow investors? This is [Gold Rush territory]( man.

I know you're joking, but when everyone asks why people who once were curious about Bitcoin threw up their hands, it's because of this. This is 2014, not the 1850s. We've used technology to revert to this draconian libertarianism that literally promotes "It's every man for himself and the Devil for them all," unless of course you're one of the ones the Devil got first.

It's not about that. It's about people who have studied history realizing what we're really dealing with here, [the gold rush mentality]( all over again. It's like going back to eye-for-an-eye times. Why is everyone so set on recreating the misery of these bygone eras that we should be learning from?

What? Your *escrow services*, exchanges, and wallets are completely unprotected and vulnerable unless you literally mattress hoard...
My point: people use banks and regulated businesses for their financial transactions *for a reason*. If you refuse to do that, quit complaining about the thieves those regulated services are trying to deflect.
God, you're all such a huge bunch of *whiners*.

[You have got to be kidding me. REALLY?](

I was being snippy, but seriously, doesn't anyone see how oxymoronic this is? You can't pump how great deregulated currency is and then complain that the "wild west" is just too much for you in the same breath, without dealing with some major cognitive dissonance...
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:07:56
Because I'm not a stupid baby pounding my chest about how amazing a deregulated currency is while in the same breath crying my eyes out because that self-same deregulation couldn't protect you from "enterprising" thieves.
It makes me nauseated to say these things out loud, they're so idiotic.

Well, when you pay your rent and buy food in that money (and every other item, btw), guess what? Speculators just lost half of your savings.
Unfortunately for you, that fiat exchange *determines* your BTC value, both at the exchange and what you can buy direct with BTC.
Nobody selling an iPad for .75 BTC last week is going to accept .75 BTC today. Sorry bro, your pride is expensive, now.

Maybe you should stop "hoping" and start using currency that has protection under the law?
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:54:56
My point is you are less likely to be getting scammed if you use services that are actually regulated. Quit defending the whiners. Either you take the extra scam risks dealing with Bitcoin and suck it up, or go the fuck home. Just quit bitching.

Boooooooooring. Go lose all your money already.

I still have about 3M cosbycoins.

You're not using cash, buddy! You're exchanging currency like you might on the streets of Saigon! Unregulated currency exchanges have risks, so suck up your losses and get mining!


Not saying they don't. Just saying that if you're relying on unregulated exchanges and wallet systems (compared real currency exchanges and banks), quit bitching about thieves!
