If you're saying that his picks show that he doesn't intend to "drain the swamp", what do you think about the lobbying ban and  the anti-lobbying forms all members of his transition team and administration had to sign?  Seems like things are looking pretty good on that front for just 2 weeks.

Oh that's pretty cool, thanks! Though it looks like they won't sell Amazon Gift Cards so that sucks.

I had to change the password on the site I was keeping them in and, for security, it locked things up for 48 hours. Whoops. So let's hope this isn't a bubble that'll burst too severely.
But thanks for the offer though.

I wasn't really sure where to put this but: 
I've been holding onto a fraction of a coin for a while and I just want to cash out at this point. And while it's super easy to buy and trade BTC, Jesus, it seems really difficult to sell. It sounded like CoinBase was one of my best options but I tried registering and I keep getting an error.


Anyway, is there any site out there that makes it somewhat safe/easy to cash out? Or, if not, if there a site where I can trade my BTC for an Amazon Gift Card or something? Preferably automated. I ask because I remember using some automated site that gave me a Gift Card a few years back and that all worked out fine but I can't seem to find it.
I'm in the US, for sites that depend on that.
