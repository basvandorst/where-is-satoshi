The old ones just stick a bunch of buzz words they heard from their grandkids ~~on their slow crawl to the glue pits~~ and call it news. I find it rather hilarious that this shit used to fly. If you ever wonder how so many people got so very very dumb you don't need to look much father.
Why do you think "they" have tried to wall off and control the internet for the past 20 years? Dumb shit eating sheep are way easier to farm than a few million pissed off goats.

USB has been massively compromised. only new components are safe but Instances are rare and specific exploits targeting obscure devices are even rarer. keylogger on your windows pc or everything else you've suggested as "improvements" are much higher risk. If it connects via wifi or bluetooth it's fucked. You have no idea what you are talking about please go play with your iphone and your hacked "smart fridge".

If it connects to wifi it's not safe from me and I've been out of the game for a couple of years now. If it connects via the cell networks it's not safe from the cell networks and people smarter than me :)
