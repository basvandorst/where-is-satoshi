Yes, what is this money going to buy/fund? People here seem to think funding leading scientific research in this grassroots way is good, but I am cautious. I don't know what this guy is actually going to do/doing. If he hadn't used MIT/Harvard in the title, people wouldn't even give a shit. If people want to fund a scientist, you should either really trust them, or know the subject very well. This seems weird with the Onarbor thing, too. If this person had just posted about his new website that he is accepting funding for, then I got no problems.

Fair enough.  How are you funded otherwise? I believe responsible crowd funding for research is great, but is that what is going on here? I just want to avoid a paradigm of, "This guy sounds smart, and I want him to cure cancer. Take my money". The simpler a proposal, the more I trust it will be accomplished (like getting fresh water to the thirsty). Otherwise, as bureaucratic and arbitrary as they seem, scientific committees should decide what research is worth funding, and what is not. I hope your research is successful; I'm not trying to knock on terrific work that you've done. I just wouldn't know.

One thing to address is how energy/power consuming the BTC network is compared to a centralized system. A centralized system is more efficient, but IMO the transparency will ALWAYS be worth the extra cost in network maintenance. Hopefully the future holds a more efficient decentralized PoW system.
