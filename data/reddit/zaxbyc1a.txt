yeah, he sounds pretty amazing when reading charts....but he lacks gut sense. Too myopic. TA without gut sense loses,imo...
He makes his $ on sfeminars and the like that exploit his "dazzle" ability,I'd guess.

keep reading til YOU understand it......
If you rely on other's explanations and sentiments (that may be skewed) , then youre crippling your resulting personal understanding and personal convictions that inform your investment commitments and ideas and feelings.
In other words, give YOUR self a chance before giving others a chance at filling your brain....
That way, your chances of winning increase and losing decrease.

thats a hard lesson to get about this fledgling cryptosphere. I'm no tecchy but just doing my dd on securing my hard-earned funds in this evolving and wild-west cryptoland....I learned that the first thing is to be careful. 1200 btc is a LOT of scratch.....and,imo, it would require a lot of secure means INCLUDING being aware of the possible arbitrary actions that 3rd parties can levy against your best wishes. If u have been in this crypto space since 2011......u should have already known &amp; implemented precautions and not be surprised that an exchange or other 3rd party could go against your plans. So, either u need this lesson.....or u have a ton of more assets that make this 1200btc amount merely inconvenient(and thus, not worthy of the security care that one would take if it were all they had)!

y’know.......was just thinking that this “hodler” (hopeful speculation gone wrong)situation is really, by default, a good way of creating adoption ....in that, while waiting for the prices to go bullish, hodlers will invariably spend some of their captive crypto....since most hodlers are really those who got in (late)on the gold rush and expected to cash out big. Short time horizons gone long by default. I know I certainly have used summa my crypto for mundane expenditures,thusly....��
