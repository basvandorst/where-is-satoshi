I have [edited the post]( to reflect this, sorry for the misunderstanding -- it was rooted in this "Pending orders" which you told customers to contact to get back. I now understand this is a small minority and the article is updated to have healthy skepticism (why not tell people the exact amount you lost if youre so transparent?) but accurate information of how your site operates. Good luck with new rewrite.

I appreciate the advice since you seem like youre being sincere, but I'm not trying to be a serious blogger or journalist, i'm just having fun really and getting my thoughts down into an easily referenced archived way while helping people at the same time. i noticed I was helping friends a lot and doing a lot of discussions and then not having any record when i was showing someone else. so i thought it nice to have something to look back on
exposing NewsBTC was totally a fluke, because I noticed a guy "Dr. Tameer Sameeh" was a freelance writer claiming to be a pediatrician (big red flag), but his CV only had a master's level pediatrics degree (obvious fraud). Then i noticed there was a weird pattern where NewsBTC constantly made baseless articles connecting bitcoin and ISIS. I felt obligated to present this evidence even in my silly little site's environment (I paid the price for it too, [my servers were DDoS'd]( by NewsBTC and I got threats). Lots of people found this useful. And the information was strong on its own, not needing me to point to reputation or anything. just like bitcoin, doesn't matter nobody knows who created it, because the code and the content speaks for itself.

lol that's hilarious. is this thread being raided by Blythe Masters groupies or something?
yea it was a joke, some people got it, others are too stupid or enamoured with her to like it :)
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:47:43
she already is the joke. all the serious responses to her have already been made. now she is just a target for lulz.
i am writing many diff articles of many diff types. I exposed a [lying fraud who was spreading false headlines connecting ISIS to bitcoin]( , I've made [useful tool to help traders]( i [post market updates]( and i also have a little fun. If i want to have fun im going to have fun. it's my stupid site nobody reads remember? :)

@_date: 2016-02-27 14:19:07
He's completely right about capital flight being bullish on btc
The way China jumps in to Bitcoin when fearing devaluation, any informed developing country individual can do the same. Once it catches on and the rising price of BTC makes people want to jump in even more, the cycle can erupt greatly

Just one important note: the financials are not audited by a real accounting firm, as shown in the main image.
@_date: 2015-11-25 10:48:50
Thanks so much for your support. I had to respond becuase he made a false statement that the site only had 1 bitcoin related post, and I'm kind of in like a war mode because ive been having to fight this DDoS attack and its not easy tbh so im more defensive than normal. Im going to go take a break and relax :)
@_date: 2015-11-24 19:46:00
Um, you're looking up old news when this is something that has happened very recently:
When wholesale bank rates are -0.75% this trickles down to retail level over time as the market responds. Now finally there are banks putting negative rate on retail deposits, [such as this ABS has announced](
Quelle surprise, a buttcoiner doesn't know what he's talking about and spends more time trying to be snarky than to find truth

It's really impressive what they're doing over there in embracing technology in every way. There's a couple really bitcoin-friendly banks there too.
@_date: 2015-11-29 06:44:21
ZeroHedge is all over the place on bitcoin. I know they're a collection of guest writers and stuff so they always have different opinions, but their goldbug nature seems to shine through.
Not that I'm against gold, but there's a certain faction of goldbugs who absolutely hate crypto

Well he was banned from ChangeTip for a pretty dumb reason so I think it was worthwhile to show what he did and how ChangeTip reacted. Shows downside of centralized service
@_date: 2015-11-23 09:14:43
Good I will include this information in the post thanks
@_date: 2015-11-27 09:02:55
It's something that has potential for abuse, you can get creative.. Im not going to argue further with you
@_date: 2015-11-24 22:00:50
okay but it really is already happening to consumer accounts as ABS and other banks have rolled out. so we are already there.
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:27:04
If that was all it was I would not have posted it, but Changetip's reaction to ban him and not fix something that was a problem for almost a year is worth highlighting. 
I get what you're saying but Changetip banning someone for a dumb reason and him explaining the little trick is worth reading. And really it's just for fun, look how they overreact, as if it is such a big deal.

  We don't post headlines that are lies, that's one thing that makes us better?
The issue with NewsBTC was never "self-promotion", it's the lies and the lack of integrity.
If you have some specific point to make I'm open to hear but you don't make any sense, as we're not "firehose rapid-feed succession" self promoting. there's been no "flooding of articles" -- and "doom/gloom"? wat? We wrote 1 article exposing the lying headlines, and another article following up describing the attack. Each article we post gets posted on Twitter, and we choose good ones to get posted to Reddit.
Please provide specific information to back up your claims of flooding or find a single headline that is wrong/misleading to demonstrate that we are no better than NewsBTC (feel free to use [the Search function on our site]( to examine every post that has been made before).
@_date: 2015-11-24 23:47:05
Oh he's very sick, look at the Twitter exchange i had with him:
You can see the whole thread there up and down or 
at my timeline.
He also was all over the [comments thread of the last post]( and making really bizarre comments under the name Also in his own story on newsbtc , [every single post was negative]( but he was playing victim while talking about how great he is, really crazy

Not just newsbtc but also this "Dr. Tamer Sameeh" character. He is the one writing unreliable uninformed articles on there.
A commenter found [this profile of him](
A pediatrician who is doing cheap freelance article writing. I wouldn't let this shady guy anywhere near a child.
Edit: [here is a useful picture]( to remind not to trust this guy!

True, but they would be the bank that's "on the margin" which represents where things are going. There's still going to be downward pressure on funding rates when there's deflation and the SNB rates are still -0.75%

As I [told you on Twitter]( don't take it personal
You see that everybody is against your misleading false headlines, why dont you just make an apology and try to rebuild your reputation?  Don't be stubborn when you see the backlash, adapt and grow

Hey buddy, try to click the "Previous" button at bottom to see more blog posts! the four that are on the front page are just the latest four. lol, cant even navigate a site, so your opinion isn't worth much, chief. 
a NATO member attacking Russia is major news geopolitically. Look through all our posts, 90% are pure bitcoin, and that post alone we mentioned it's not directly bitcoin related but is very big news to watch. The three other currently on the front page (1. Bitcoin-ISIS headlines being fake, 2. Kraken bitcoin exchange extortion, and 3. this one) are bitcoin related. So are you just drunk or?
listen if you dont care about websites spreading misinformation which then appears in mainstream headlines associating bitcoin to ISIS, okay. but obviously youre in minority and you didn't take more than 1 minute to understand the situation. so i don't blame you for being ignorant, bambie
Oh sorry, i just realised you're a troll by [looking at your constantly negative and trolling comments here](
@_date: 2015-11-25 09:23:59
Mate you dont have to care, but NewsBTC is the source of multiple bogus articles linking Bitcoin to ISIS and Terrorism falsely with no evidence. So it affects the community when this misinformation disseminates across secondary sites, and we pointed this out. That's all man. Thanks for reading though.
@_date: 2015-11-25 09:09:52


Wow, so basically "I'm going to make baseless accusations against you with no evidence, and then just cite my feelings, which are just as valid". It's YOU who is no better than NewsBTC, as you are making shit up on the fly with no evidence at all.
Okay let me explain, this is , where people dont just act on their feelings and emotions like children, but with actual data and facts. Let me outline the facts point by point:
1. We aren't even a news site, we help users learn how to trade Bitcoin futures contracts. NewsBTC is NOT our competitor. We are just a blog!
2. Our most recent Twitter posts were RESPONSES to Tamer harassing our account on Twitter -- we did NOT engage him!
3. We chose to expose NewsBTC because their constant lies connecting Bitcoin to Terrorism have hurt Bitcoin's reputation and misled thousands of people. 
We took the risk confronting them on our platform and got DDoS'd for it, and you come here saying we are just as bad because we posted a Twitter profile and you just have "feelings" about it with no evidence? No offense, but fuck you and your stupid "feelings". It's not cool to hear this uneducated accusations against us when we just suffered attack bleeding sources and still dont back down.

As I accumulate bad actors of news sites i will make dedicated link to shame them. NewsBTC is one, cryptocoinnews is another. Any additional (with examples) you can contribute would be great.
@_date: 2015-11-17 08:50:14
It's not a TA piece, it's referencing a shift in sentiment coming directly from futures market data
@_date: 2015-11-25 09:00:51
Well by exposing him we entered the "news site" realm I guess, even though we are more of a blog that focuses on market action/analysis, we do post news updates that are relevant to bitcoin that could affect price. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 07:17:12
They also got exclusive documents when Cyprus was doing the "bail-in" in Eurozone. So yea, they're not just some joke site, i think any serious finance person secretly reads it :)
WSJ is great if you just ignore their op-ed articles. They tend to really stick to the facts and don't try to bullshit their readers because the richest people in the world are reading their shit and can smell bullshit/propaganda pretty easily

I'm also an oldtimer on ZeroHedge and you're spot on about the role they play now. 
It's MUCH LESS impressive to "call it" when the market is dooming when EVERY SINGLE DAY a site or person is just screaming about collapse.
Perpetually professing economic doom is a great industry when we have a corrupt banking system at the heart of our monetary institutions which leads to crisis ever 7 years like clockwork.
Needless to say though I still read zerohedge regularly, they get serious scoops now and then and it's a perspective that's always worth considering, on top of Bloomberg (best because it's free with no paywall shit like other financial publications), Economist, WSJ, Financial Times. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 07:02:03

I personally think it's not helpful to tout it as anonymous, not just because it's technically inaccurate, but because  there's a graveyard of payment services that used anonymity as their selling point. has a good point about using the angle of *privacy*, which has a different "tone" but conveys features of bitcoin which really can be used for anonymity purposes
