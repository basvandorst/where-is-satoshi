There are 0 fees. No merchant terminal rental or anything like that either. 
It is a web-based application that the merchant can run on their own IPAD.

TravelByBit and Living Room of Satoshi are partnering to roll out real crypto payment systems to Australian Merchants.
We have over 50 merchants already, including the world's first digital currency friendly [Airport]( . 
Airport transfers can be paid with crypto and hotels are directly accepting crypto for rooms and the bar.
The [list of merchants ]( is growing every day!
This is not a TenX style solution, this is real merchants accepting crypto directly!
Check out [TravelByBit ]( for more info.

Thanks! This is an exciting technology. It's still very early but we'd love to get people starting to try it out for real.
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:35:28
You can also pay out directly to any Australian bank account at Living Room of Satoshi. ��
@_date: 2017-05-14 03:29:07
They may not show in your account while you have a stop-limit in place. I guess so you can't double spend it. Try cancelling the stop-limit and see if your balance returns.
@_date: 2018-04-17 01:46:09
Hehe - yeah you're right, it's still very early, and UX has a way to go yet. 
If you're an early adopter and want to try it out, we hope this guide will help you make your first payment on Lightning Network!

Those 0.9% market crashes are killer! Bitcoins dead. /s

You can cash out your Bitcoin straight to your bank account with [Living Room of Satoshi ]( and there is no sign-up required.
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:06:10
If you bought as an investment then no worries, just hold on to them for a while and options may present themselves down the track. If you're wanting to actually use your Bitcoin right now you can pay your bills or cash it out to your bank account with [Living Room of Satoshi ](
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:29:01
If they convert it to fiat, that means people are buying the Bitcoin back off them and the merchant to consumer to merchant cycle continues. 
Isn't that what an economy is?
And every bill or expense you have in life is a pretty big minor niche.
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:12:55
In Australia you can already pay almost ANY merchant using Bitcoin and other Alts, and millions of dollars worth of bills have already been paid doing just [that.]( 
You can also organise for your salary(or part of) to be paid [directly ]( in Bitcoin, thus removing the need to "purchase crypto to use it to buy things."
Are there criminals using Bitcoin? Definitely.
Does that mean there's not still value in crypto for the rest of us though?
