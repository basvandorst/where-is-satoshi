"Hey sir can I have a dollar?"
Sir: "beat it kid. Go get a job."
"Can I have some spare bitcoin?"
Sir: "Yeah here's 20000satosh."

Isn't that the same thing every government can do?

No, but porn is

The moment you cash out you create an endpoint which can be used to investigate where your Bitcoin came from. It's how the blockchain works, you can't cheat. You can try but once a single data point is visible your entire history is visible.

The block chain is not on your side. You would be fucked.

Yeah by all means you could but at that point it's you and 100k million in cash that you can't deposit. And as long as you got the coins originally in a way that does not tie to you like buying from exchange that requires ID, you will be fine. I know your asking hypothetical but this would be multiple federal crimes and is not suggested you break the law.

But to verify a transaction you would need a miner. So how does this make sense?
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:01:54
Let me just tell you about being impatient, being impatient losses me lots of money I was mining 1 ETH a week till I just got impatient and just started selling and went on to other things to come back and see ETH went above $2. My jaw Fucking dropped.

Well I'm glad my questions are helping others :)

What does a individual gain for setting up a node. I understand that it benefits the network.
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:44:52
Hodl and don't look back.
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:41:20
Was one of the first ones but only had my gpu that I use to game to mine. It was only a R9 290 but it was making bank back then if only I knew it would blow up like it did.
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:48:13
OK I'm following, but I have another question now. How does a transaction get to your node? Does the network just evenly distribute transaction across all nodes?
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:38:16
No I walked away when it was $2 it went to $200 then $500 then $800

I'm sure they will Make a quantum resilient encryption by then. 
IOTA is quantum resilient.
Current quantum processors are not faster then current processors so there's still time.

i think of this too often and i can only hope.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:01:52
i still have a few and i tend to pass them out to friends or family when in conversation about crypto in the early days, i sometimes wonder if these will be like a collectors item in the future or something.

Been a slow repayment but at least I'm getting my money back...
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:49:29
The fee is important as some new people see that in some instances they are given the option to not pay a fee and they are stuck with the funds taking week or close to a month to get processed. So the fee payed makes the difference in how quick it will be processed on the network. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:16:33
The reward is the tnx fee

You can't tell me not to do something, HODL!!
