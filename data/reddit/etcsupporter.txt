You understand it perfectly. Running the code is equivalent to voting. Every time they mine a block they put a vote in that block and that vote is only valid for a certain number of blocks.
You are right about how it sounds. This thread is an echo chamber.

I don't see backward compatibility issues. I am not saying we remove the ability to reference the transaction hash, but rather allow both
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:26:00
Let's start with the two subs. 
r/btc wants the block size to be larger while r/bitcoin is happy with 1 meg. r/bitcoin was getting flooded with messages about increasing the block size and decided to label all messages regarding block size increases as spam. This alienated many users and they had to create a new sub where they could discuss increasing the block size.
The lightning network is a solution to the block size issue and will allow us to handle a large number of transactions off chain. This could remove the need for larger blocks. Both sides, despite the FUD below, are in favor of a lightning network. 
The problem is the lightning network does not exist yet and users may be forced to switch to another currency before it is created. We also cannot create a lightning network without something like segwit.
There are two big issues people have with segwit. 
First off, it is complicated and that could create unforseen problems down the road. Many want a simpler solution to this problem, one that they can fully understand.
Second it is made by Core. There are many that are really angry with Core. They believe Core is morally compromised and willing to risk bitcoin's future for their own financial gain. So some are blocking it out of spite.
That's as close to ELI5 as I can do

Not really. Bitcoin is faster then all of those payment methods. After approximately 10m the transaction is recorded on the network, after 6 transactions it may as well be written in stone. It takes credit cards and PayPal 3 months before a transaction becomes irreversible
@_date: 2016-12-06 19:54:23
Why the FUD? This is a simple idea devoid of any bashing and you need bring name calling into it.
I'm not a coder so no I'm not able to code it. If its good enough I trust someone else will code it for us.

@_date: 2017-05-30 14:40:55
This has nothing to do with running non mining full nodes. How would running a non mining node prevemt that scenario? 
The only way they could suspend service is if they could shut down the miners. Which again show the real security comes from the miners. 
Edit: Governments would be unable to prevent companies in other countries from offering full nodes service via Tor. The companies could even do it anonymously asking for tips or charging a fee.

You do realize he is talking about Segwit right? Segwit is the only change to the protocol.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:37:21
Genuine question. 
Listen we can debate which is better but I doubt either of us will convince the other. The point I think we can find common ground is the initial design. The initial design was uncapped blocks without segwit, I get you dont think that works but this is fact. 
Can we agree on this point?
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:01:34
The original white paper and message board discussions called for regular block size increases. The main difference between bitcoin as it was described and created by the cyberpunks and bitcoin as it will be after this agreement is segwit. The insertion of the oligopoly, according to this tweet, is Segwit. We can agrue about which is better or worse, but it is clear that he believes Segwit is corporate control inserted into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:43:00
Sure they can choose to mine it, so why aren't they? They dont need a UASF to make this choice, they can start mining at any time.
This idea that a miner is blocking someone from doing something is really funny because we aren't in a system where people can do that anymore. How can Jihan or anyone else block you from mining Segwit blocks? They can't. They aren't signalling that they will mine these blocks as well and I am really confused why you think a UASF would make any difference to Jihan or any of the other miners.
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:47:44
That was painful to watch. Full of circular logic and assumptions. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:07:16
You think POW is a bug?
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:49:16
:-) You misunderstood me. I believed the quote is irrelevant because it does not suggest exchanges will not accept both. Actual I was mistaken, it is relevant because it proves my point. If they do not want to deal with replay attacks then they must accept both, recognizing only one coin is what caused the replay attacks.
Normally you would be right, splitting with Etherium would be easier. With a segwit coin and a legacy coin, however, it would be trivial. Creating a new segwit transaction for all incoming coins and waiting for it to confirm would do the trick.
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:17:57
You realize their is no such thing as a user activated fork right? If miners dont actually mine blocks you do not have a cryptocurrency. If you want to create change you need to start mining. No one cares if you are not sharing their blocks. Read the white paper and learn how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:58:15
Thats totally incorrect. Any activation period would be used to upgrade software which is also necessary for Segwit. The risk of hard forking and activating segwit are the same.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:46:55
According to your logic that is exactly what they are doing now. So why are they leaving money on the table?
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:26:10
Hmm. You are right. I assumed they were adding code to make segwit transactions invalid on the old chain.
If they do a UASF without a method of splitting coins then that is just plain irresponsible, also it would likely kill the project. Who would to send a anyone can spend transaction when the majority of hash power is not signalling segwit? Recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:30:59
Thats funny cause I remember it differently. Let's check facts here.
Big blockers have been warning us for 4 years we would be here if we do not increase the block size. This was before segwit.
Block stream said high fees and full blocks are good for bitcoin
There is a compromise on the table for 2 megs and segwit which roger supports
This community is against any compromise including this recent proposal
Who is really blocking bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:32:50
That sounds like what you are doing
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:13:18
In this forum people like to bash miners and diminish their importance. They make the false claim that non mining nodes secure the network. This is completely false. Non mining nodes, like your raspberry pi, give some anonymity but are completely unnecessary. Miners are the only thing that secures the bitcoin network. After the UASF the hope is miners will see the light and start mining the new chain. If the miners do not switch over then the new chain will die quickly.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:39:09
No its because waiting for a confirmation is unnecessary for low value transactions like lunch or coffee
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:44:09
I asked how much testing larger blocks needs not segwit. You seem convinced that segwit requires more testing. Sounds about right.
Terrabite blocks are probably ten or more years down the road not using today's computers. 
With terrabite blocks you may not be able to run a non mining node in the future. Thats irrelevant as you do not need to trust bitmain or any other miner any more then you have to today. Have you read the white paper? Where are non mining nodes mentioned in there? No where. SPV wallets provides more then enough security for average users. Big companies like BitPay will likely need to run their own non mining nodes which you can point your wallet to if you wish.
Listen to this bile you spout about miners. Its crazy. 'Bitmain and friends'. What's the deal with that? You are upset about mining centralization? Segwit won't help you with that.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:16:48
Jesus. The cognitive desonance with you is strong. Is it Jihans chain or mine? Im confused. You realize he is in support of the new agreement that includes segwit right? Kinda destroys your entire argument about him not wanting segwit because of asciiboost. Also, last time there was a poll for bigger blocks bitcoin votes were pretty solidly in favor of bigger blocks. I guess you think that was Jihan as well somehow
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:09:01
Ever heard of a Sybil attack? Node count doesn't mean anything as it is too easy to forge. Thats why Bitcoin is built on hash power not number of nodes. One can be faked and one cannot.

@_date: 2017-05-24 00:12:41
Please explain how the nodes provide security and why (if they are so important) they were never mentioned in the white paper?
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:15:01
I regularly use SPV wallets over Tor. Performance is not an issue. Privacy is. There are several ways to mitigate this issue though.
1. Future versions of Spv Wallets will check random wallets as well as yours to create privacy by obscurity. This plus Tor is plenty of privacy for the average user.
2. You dont need to run a full node to gain sufficient privacy if there are nodes that you can trust with your privacy. This could be a company like EFF. This could be you and twenty people pitching in to purchase a full node and share the expenses.
3. VPNs, although not as good as Tor. Will also give you pretty good privacy versus governments.
You need to trust miners to choose the order of transactions. Thats it. If you can trust that you have found the longest chain then a SPV wallet will verify everything else.
Of course I'm concerned about mining centralization, but I'm not going to go around vilifying them for it. I probably would do the same thing and Im not exactly worried about them trying to do a 51% attack on the network. I'm frustrated they dont seem to agree with me about bigger blocks, but I try not to hate people for disagreeing with me.
This idea that bitcoin needs everyone to run a non mining full node is incorrect. Bitcoin is not centralized because of lack of full nodes. If tomorrow all users shut off their full nodes, and only corporations were running non mining nodes,  what attack vector would you be concerned about? What would be the worse case scenario?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:38:02
How is that relevant? Not listing a coin still leaves you vulnerable to replay attacks as users can still steal the coins you are not listing. This is exactly what happened to exchanges that did not list both coins. The only way to protect yourself from this is by splitting all incoming coins. Not very hard to do.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:51:16
He's not the only one selling mining machines. There are plenty of companies that do. Hell, you could design your own if you wanted. There are mining companies all over the world and some companies will allow you to rent hash power so you could literally mine without purchasing any equipment. 
But sure tell yourself you can't mine. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:32:20
They aren't mining this chain now, why would they mine it after this UASF?
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:51:40
Thats my point. Unless you actually mine it then there is no token. This idea that miners will start mining the new chain because the coins will be worth more is laughable because it assumes the miners will see the value of the new coins before they are created. If the miners saw the value of the not yet mined coins then they would have already switched.
There is no value for that which does not exist.This UASF is a farce as it implies nodes have any network effect. If you want to initiate change then you have to actually start mining. This is the way bitcoin was designed. Miners are the only ones who get a vote, which is good as anyone can become a miner.
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:33:14
Why does it have to be a soft fork? We've had plenty of successful hard forks in the past
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:48:15
How would legacy chain be vulnerable to 51% attack? Segwit is at 30% so more miners support it. I think you need to take a breath and think about how none of this makes sense.

@_date: 2017-05-29 16:48:34
Why do you believe anyone cares if non mining nodes accept their block? Wallets will work around your road block and find the longest chain even if you try to censor it.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:33:52
30% of miners are signalling Segwit. So it is logical to assume that 30% or less will switch over after this UASF. That means 70% of the miners will stay on the legacy chain. How can 30% do a 51%? It is the UASF chain that will be vulnerable.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:31:18
You are changing the subject. The point of the conversation is the value of the video not segwit. The video sucks. You asked me where he used circular logic and I told you where.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:41:09
How would you be unable to access your btc? 
How would the government know you own btc if you were to use public WiFi, vpn, or Tor?
I need specific examples of how this scenario could happen. Non mining full nodes do not do anything to prevent the first scenario.
The SPV scenarios are good at the moment. You said via Tor maybe impossible meaning you haven't tried. I am do this at least once a week. Works great. Electrum plus tails is a great solution. Add in public WiFi for the super paranoid.
The nice thing is anyone can program better software, no need for permission. You could write it if you have the talent.
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:17:04
If the confirmation times are slower and the fees are cheaper then that means less usage. You can't have one without the other. 
What kinda testing do you think larger blocks needs? Its not a change to the protocol just allows more space.
Sure 8 mg will one day get full, so we go to 20, and then eventually a terabyte. As processing power, storage and connection speeds go up we will be able to handle more transactions. By keeping the block size small you are effectively forcing users off of the blockchain and into either the lightning network or alts as it will be too expensive to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:11:24
Sure but you still need someone to actually record the transactions. Without mining you have nothing. Thats why bitcoin is designed so that anyone can mine. Running a node has zero effect. If your node doesnt propagate transactions then it has no effect on the network
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:20:56
Not all alt coins are merge mined. There are plenty of coins that do not have users yet and their value is purely speculative. The fact that you are ignorant of that makes me wonder how knowledgeable you are on this subject.
There is no possible way the legacy chain will drop in value to zero after a UASF. The fact that you believe that suggests you dont actually talk with real users. Many of us want a block size increase and no one with any brains is going to send a segwit transaction without majority miner support. Its too risky. 
What does Bitmain do if 30% switched? I dont pretend to know all of the possible outcomes like you do. I also understand that transactions likely won't confirm cheaper right away. It will be about the same as many users will be worried about sending segwit transactions at first. 
Very likely we will see the remaining miners hard fork to 8 megs and if we do we will see which chain is actually cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:19:33
I think you dont understand what I am talking about. 
UASF does not measure consensus as anyone can spin up thousands of nodes. It is like an online poll, completely meaningless. 
You know what is a valid method of measuring support? Bitcoin votes that showed overwealming support for increasing the block size. Hashing power which seems to be on the fence. Adding messages into bitcoin transactions (would be nice to have). Node count is a bad method of determining what users want. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:06:43
The quickest solution is bigger blocks as that would be instant. Everyone benefits and we dont need to create special transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:15:32
I win too. If we increase the block size then I can send transactions without paying $2 in fees. That sounds like a win for users like me. Actually that sounds like a win for everyone doesnt it?
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:42:59
Of course they have a choice. This linear thinking is funny because it makes you sound childish. The real world doesnt work that way. There are many variables in this world and impossible to predict outcomes like this with any certainty. 
Let's talk about other flaws in your statement
Miners only need an exchange in order to mine a coin not users. There are many coins without users that are being profitably mined. Loosing users would lower the value and might push miners away but it also might not.
Users are split on this decision. Not every user wants segwit. 
Non mining nodes do not indicate user support nor consensus. Most users are not running a node.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:13:42
Sure but the miners are actually the ones to initiate the chain. If a miner is not mining transactions on this new chain then there isnt a new chain. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:55:48
If after this UASF split, which I doubt will happen, you have 30% of miners switching, which is unlikely, the confirmation time will be much slower due to the lack of mining. It takes a while for the difficulty adjustment and users will not be switching over as the experience will be abysmal. 
If you were to switch to 8 megs which we have more support for, this would not be the case. 
Why do you want to push people off of Bitcoin and into the lightning hub? Why dont you support people using bitcoin as it was designed and not what Core is trying to change it into?
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:52:48
They will list both as evidenced from etc
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:45:55
With your computer and current difficulty it will take years for you to mine the first block. Difficulty won't adjust until you have mined many blocks. You would have to hard fork and adjust the difficulty
@_date: 2016-07-29 17:19:41

@_date: 2017-05-25 07:54:59
