I like how this sub spitefully, incorrectly, refers to it as bcash.  It’s kinda petty.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:21:44
I run s full mode.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:38:38
So the .9 btc was actually “returned” back to me under a different address.  That would explain why the balances in my bitcoin core wallet match up. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:00:33
Swore I saw it break 13k on coin market cap.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:35
Both Grey's Anatomy and Big Bang Theory had shows revolving around Bitcoin.  I wonder if that had anything to do with the regular joe's and jane's?
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:09:04
I bought $100
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:15:46
Bch is up dude. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:14:10
The moment I turned my auto-buy back on at coinbase it took a dive.  This always happens when I buy btc.  I'll let you guys know next time I do so that you can sell high
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:32:52
Selling your bch at any time puts you in a better position than you were in pre-fork.  I’m holding my bch just like I’m holding my btc.  If bch tanks I’ve lost literally nothing.  You have nothing to lose by holding your bch.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:28:05
When it forked you were given free money.  If you sold it for anything you made out better than you did before 
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:42:01
The best time was literally a few days ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:30:01
The difference is what happens AFTER.  There is no difference in the reasons why we don’t make these sorts of things public.  Either way.  Dont do it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:13:00
That’s why you gotta do it fast.  There has to be some demand otherwise a fork wouldn’t happen.  So there has to be some sort of initial value.  That’s when I’m selling forks from now on.  I missed out in selling BCH and BCG right away.  When this fork happen I’ll probably sell it off as fast as possible then buy more btc.
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:00:30
Is not in my wallet's transactions at all.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:55:51
Forks are great.  Free money for me to invest back in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:08:17
This is the best I’ve seen it put 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:22:56
Its no different than telling random people on the internet how much money you have in your bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:16:46
is that even possible?
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:02:36
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:15:02
I transferred it from my bank account to circle on 6/30 and immediately sent it to the aforementioned address.
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:08:31
Thanks for your help so far.
I dont see this address in my wallet.  I wouldnt have gotten a receiving address from anywhere else though.  I've never sent BTC to anyone but myself.
@_date: 2015-07-11 20:57:30
no dice, sir.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:21
Well that ended quickly.
@_date: 2015-07-11 20:47:25
Doing that now.  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-07-12 10:44:17
And despite how he was portrayed in the movie, everyone thought of him as a coward and disgrace.
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:26:48
If people are able to sell a bitcoin for twice the “market rate” then that’s the market rate.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:15:13
Arguably less
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:12:08
Oh there’s huge fees. Just not to some regular broker 
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:22:28
So your comment was completely in the context of using it to move a good amount of transactions, rather than saying to not use it at all?
@_date: 2015-04-04 11:01:56
Is this only a problem if you keep you coins with them.  I signed up for circle when it started because of how easy it is.  However as soon as money is available to be transferred out I put it in my wallet. I never have more than a few pennies in my circle account at any one time.
@_date: 2015-04-04 11:15:41
Serious question:  If you admit its too broad and vague, why do you think that vagueness doesn't extend to Snowden?
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:13:29
Yuuuuuuuuge fees 
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:23:55
Defeats the purpose of bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-03-18 12:07:23
Serious question.  Why do people keep their funds in exchanges?  Is there a benefit?  My funds are in an exchange only long enough to move them to their destination being either my wallet or my bank account.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:36:56
Nonsense.  One of bitcoins selling features cheap, instant way to send funds.  That's not the case any more.
Edit: lots of people around here forgetting about the sales pitch that was bitcoin just even a couple of years ago.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:24:20
I'll concede that instant might not have been the best description being that there seems to be some dispute over what instant is.  I was supposed to be able to buy a pizza with my bitcoin and ideally I'd need the transaction to cost very little and be "very" fast.  As in minutes.
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:36:40
Oh, i just took the default the client spit out.  Whats a "good" fee?
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:39:22
This is the first time I've loaded up my bitcoin client in a a couple years.  So much for the fast transaction and low fees that were promised.  I wanted to cash out in this surge, maybe I won't re-buy in the future.
Edit: aww did I hurt feelings that bitcoin isn't operating as promised.  Thanks for downvotes. &lt;3 u 2
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:50:50
Well, that was just a test transaction to make sure my coinbase was setup right.  I sent over a large portion of my bitcoin just now with a $3.40 fee.  Went through almost immediately.
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:06:52
Op: this is all based off of a continued bull market
You: sorry broseph you're assumptions require a bull market.
What exactly are you disagreeing with?
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:00:21
Sounds great 
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:49:10
I bought at 2800 just before the dip.  Story of my bitcoin life.
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:42:27
These are the things I was talking about in another thread where people were playing dumb that Bitcoin didn't needto be instant and that it wasn't marketed that way just a few years ago. "Oh you don't understand bitcoin if you think it needs to be instant."  Shills, the lot of you.  A bitcoin ATM is useless without it being damn near instant.
