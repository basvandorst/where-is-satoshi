...I don't trust it.  I do trust Jimmy Wales that he will use the money. I don't care if he gives it to the Wikimedia Foundation or if he uses it himself. I'm just glad Wikipedia exists and he has been a co-founder of Wikipedia.

Very good idea. I received this email called "Hello we are Mozilla, please give us money, you won't be receiving this email again." and I really wanted to tell mozilla that I have money I want to donate in Bitcoin. Thanks for opening this topic!

And the reward will be in btc or just a hug? If he kept some spare BTC somewhere safe, he will be rewarded them when he gets access to them.

Just did. I want coinbase to be able to receive my flattrs in Bitcoin. Then they'll have a reason to register with flattr :D

Doesn't respond -1 Connecting... no response. Have you been slashdotted or what?
@_date: 2013-09-13 09:24:57
Hmm, it was there on the same page...a few "PgDn"s later.

Really, and we'll be having a news story "Computer programmers exiled: Human Rights violation"... So do you think the core dev team can even be compared with any controversial other person? I think not. Bitcoin in it's current form is even good for governments. It's Zerocoin they should be afraid of!

'Immature' or Bitcoin community-spirited? I think those who care more about community than money, leave Gox or wish to leave. Those who are in it for the money, they use Gox, works for them. Just as those who are in it for privacy, security are into the Unix-like, those who are in it for the convenience of not having to rethink and switch, Window$/Mac/iPhone etc. works fine.(should we include Android?(*nix based))

Bitcoin is alpha? Bitcoin has lived for 4 years? The main dev of Bitcoin and many other core devs do not condone of such behaviour?
@_date: 2013-07-20 13:39:47
No I don't. Though these online services that sell completely online stuff should be naturally using Bitcoin. I guess you may be their only customer who like to pay in Bitcoin.
Anyone else? :)

Multibit. Oh sorry? Did I mention multibit? What? Multibit, that will work :D
@_date: 2013-07-06 18:53:56
Does that mean gamestop businesses globally or only gamestop businesses in the USA?
@_date: 2013-08-05 10:50:04
That would work if GallopingGeese thought that Bitcoins are something much better than let's say PayPal for ideological reasons :)

They are not serious Ars Technica. New York Times is a serious paper. This AT is just cheap stuff. And seriously who are they anyway? Would you go as far as call them journalists??

The world is on drugs. And "they" blame Bitcoin for doing drugs!

"If Bitcoin isn't anonymous, then nothing is anonymous."
Bitcoin isn't anonymous. It's pseudonymous! Even washington post understands this from the experts Jerry Brito and Andrea Castillo.
All Bitcoin transactions are published as required by the protocol.
Zerocoin is a concept, but nobody has dared create a Zerocoin-based blockchain, maybe that's because the whole idea of zero-knowledge proofs is impossible, but in that imaginary utopia, yes that alt-coin would be anonymous. Trust my imagination ;D

Greene Ave Market. There are 3 stores: 1. Greene-Ville Garden 2. Fresh Garden  and 3. Greene Ave Market
I've added Greene Ave Market to coinmap, so you can find it there now.

They just make a new testnet :D
What do you think they are? Idiots? LOL
The purpose of the testnet is it to have 0 value. I think the safest bet for that to hold true is to make a new testnet, starting from 0 every other month is a good bet.

I buy steam games from the Humble indie Bundle. Just recently I got Rochard on Steam through HiB. Awesome. No complaints :D
@_date: 2013-07-15 07:01:31
Trust them? Me? I'm letting that be up to Humble Bundle inc. I pay for my games in the Humble Bundle using Coinbase as a payment processor. When Coinbase receives the Bitcoin I get my receipt for my games.
That must mean I trust them to some extent cause when I complain if something doesn't work I do send my criticism to Coinbase telling them how worthless they are and how they drive Bitcoin into the dirt. :D
Nah :D They work great!!!
@_date: 2013-08-02 21:39:14
Do they have a public email or twitter account so they can be contacted?
@_date: 2013-06-13 17:41:21
Satoshin is waiting for the introduction of zerocoin. Until then no money will be moved I think. Just a guess :D

If you know that all the previous spends were 1 BTC are you going to buy a Zerocoin with 1.9521 BTC?

Gambling, bah! Anyway, thx bit777 for telling. BitcoinPRBuzzcom please put in your topic that this is gambling, then I could skip it. I think gambling is ruining lots of people's lives. Ok if they want to ruin it with Bitcoin, their choice, and good luck for their recovery!(for them and their poor families) :)

Bitcoin-qt and the latest version of multibit(0.5.11) have message signature capability. Did this help?

I couldn't even connect to the minecraft server. Is registration needed before connecting?
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:25:23
Awesome. All implemented in javascript I guess and html5 technologies?
I wouldn't say no to a bitcoin:1234567PublicAddress0123456 link that is clickable on your site, so I could btc-flattr you with a ruby script I've gotten my hands on.
@_date: 2013-07-15 06:43:19
Sounds great!
Though I find no reference on their site that they really do accept Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin community now is much different from the Bitcoin community of 2011. If Bitcoin sees that Zerocoin works successfully for a number of Cryptocurrencies, the community 'may' want to have those features in Bitcoin as well. For me right now I have Bitcoin as the "stable version" of cryptocurrencies. Something that works today and that we want to break as little as possible. Then we have the alpha versions like....like? I don't even know. We'll all learn about them when Zerocoin will be implemented in them and they will see success and stability.

I used Sinpal*1 to buy Sincraft*2, since the Mojang developers hate Bitcoin the cryptocurrency and won't accept anything else. Seriously what is the status of Mojang towards Bitcoin? I think they both ignore it and hate it. Prove me wrong, but I think they are very hostile towards it and if you mention it to them they will ignore you and put you on the block list. They don't wanna hear about it!
*1 PayPay
*2 Minecraft
Sorry for the slightly offtopic, but Mojang hates Bitcoin just like evil PayPay does, and I used both dammit!

Reminds me of the Tor Browser Bundle. It's not automatically configured as a relay, but rather just a simple client. A simple client=Multibit. A full fledged relay=Bitcoin-qt.
