I remember a week ago it was being said it was down from 10% to 8%.. so if it has gone up to 12%, that is a 50% increase!!  :D

Even if it was true: a Reuters report went on to point out “Once a bill is drafted, legislation for an outright ban of virtual coin trading will require a majority vote of the total 297 members of the National Assembly, a process that could take months or even years.”

However, they have &lt;3% of BTC volume on all their exchanges combined.

You technically haven’t lost anything until you sell. Hold and wait for price to increase!
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:52:13
I’m pretty sure we all disagree in some capacity or we wouldn’t be here. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:10:50
I meant 8% (where it had declined to from 10%) going up to 12%. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:13:22
Buy high sell low?  Price is back up to 15k again.

Here was Elizabeth Stark's response to this (She is Lightning Network CEO):

I moved BTC from my wallet to coinbase this AM during the insane runup and had no problem getting a confirmation in about 20 mins.  I've also been making transfers between wallets and generally wait no more than 20-30 mins for it to confirm.

Bummer, I spent about $200 on games this past couple weeks using BTC/BitPay.. The fees did not bother me one bit (mainly because I'm up so I don't really care).  It was super painless to use, really liked that feature.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:26:19
Used them dozens of times, no issues.

Because he is saying that in other threads too.

This is true for equities during holiday seasons and now probably holds true in some form for crypto.  I sold 30% of my stake at various prices between $16.6k and $19.8k so I now have a 6x return on my initial investment after setting side 15% for taxes and I'm letting the rest ride long term. I invested the 6x in a couple index funds.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:38:51
In the US, yes. Holding it for a year is a long term capital gains rate of 15%. For less than a year, it’s taxed at your income tax rate. Unless you make less than around $37k/yr, there is no capital gains tax due. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:05:22
Aren't there like 2x as many buy orders though?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:54:54
Yup, this is a common effect with equities too around Christmas.

I just did two massive withdrawals from Coinbase to BofA, the most recent finished this week. No problems.

If they don’t know, then why does it matter to them?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:34:09
Good catch!
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:48:06
Fees have never been this high.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:40:23
Still think that?
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:53:47
Yeah it's because people think 2x = 200% when it's really 2x = 100% return or a doubling.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:52:58
I’m in CA, still no access
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:37:06
So where can we see the metric over time to see evidence it's moving one way or the other?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:07:50
Put a very low stop loss in, didn’t trigger. I’m still in and judging by the price now - whew!!
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:13:15
About two hours ago I transferred some BTC from Trezor to Coinbase and it took 90 mins to get all six confirmations at 140 satoshi/byte. Ridiculous!
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:44:36
I haven’t made any recent transactions. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:32:10
This happened to me too :(
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:19:47
This 25 min video details the reasoning behind his prediction.. IMO pretty compelling stuff
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:30:09
Transaction volume very high today.  Mempool hasn't been this high since 2/28 but still only about 10% of the backlog that was present in Jan.

On prem does not necessarily mean more secure.  It's only as good as it is funded and your IT staff's capabilities to build it properly. This can be more challenging for smaller companies.  At least with the major cloud providers, you know they've done their due diligence to provide great security and governance capabilities.  As long as you do proper planning and design of your cloud based services, there is a good chance it's going to be very secure.
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:29:15
It's a step in the right direction.. there will be more steps over time.

Analysis: Confirmed transactions per day are approaching 2017 ATH levels yet fees are 10% of what they were then (1000+ per byte)
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:27:25
No, it's feels good though to watch it keep rising.. it's like 2013 and 2017 all over again :D
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:18:22
I still don't see why that is relevant. If the merchant prices are in USD and the BTC equivalent due is calculated at time of checkout, and then you convert some amount of USD into BTC at approximately the same time, the volatility becomes a non-issue.  I guess your point is probably that there are not a lot of ways for consumers to instantly convert USD to BTC right now..especially while standing in a brick and mortar store.  We really need that BTC credit card now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:30:51
Except now it's just barely above $100.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:16:08
Yup..it's now settled somewhere around $90. So much for technical analysis.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:57:10
For Americans, a good analogy to help explain this is that it's like when you are over in Europe and you buy something in euros but it shows up on your credit card in USD using the present exchange rate.  This is exactly the same thing as buying something with a USD sticker price but paying with BTC behind the scenes.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:14:55
Hopefully he held..it's at $110 now.. If you can't handle the volatility, perhaps you shouldn't be trying to trade bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:00:19
How is this any different then travelling overseas and buying something on a credit card?  You buy something in the local currency but it shows up on your statement in what you are used to paying.
