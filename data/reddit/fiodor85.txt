I wrote to them and waiting for response. Anything else I can do now?

I didn't install anything like that. I have also just checked all extenions in my Chrome and there is nothing suspicious. What is even more weird, now I have Bitstamp open on my girlfriend's laptop which has never been used for anything connected with crypto and which use IP different from mine. And... yes, BTC address is still changing in every couple of minutes.

Well, the address for deposit which I see now on my acccount on BitStamp is different from the address I sent BTC today. But that BitStamp address is constantly changing, one hour ago it was different from both of above. As I am new in crypto, I have no idea is it normal or not?

u/bitn0d3 Ok, it just went really really weird. They just credited me... but over twice as much as I deposited. Some big mess they have.

BCH address it's not the one. I also log in on BitStamp on different computer with different IP and it's still the same. BTC address is changing like every several minutes.

I am not sure do I understand thah questionn. I was transferring from Gdax.

Hi, I am also trying to verify gdax third day now. I sent various IDs via their site as well as by Coinbase app and nothing :( And how do you know that they were unable to identify from your license? Did you get any message from them? I don't even know whether they get my ID or not.

if you will manage somehow to verify let me know please how did you do it. I am trying everything and still no success.

I sent docs also via Coinbase few hours ago. Still nothing happened. Did you verify your account recently? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:21:54
Nice info, thanks. Have you ever heard of any broker which follows Gdax?

Thank you!

You mean Coinbase app or just Gdax site?
