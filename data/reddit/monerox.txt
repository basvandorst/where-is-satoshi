The only one competitor to Bitcoin is monero
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:25:53
No. It is because it is a totally different code, not Bitcoin based, which take longer to be integrated to wallets.

If I listened the first one who tell me to sell, 4 years ago, I could earned like 5 bucks...

I see a beautiful lightsign like never before.
@_date: 2019-03-09 16:11:54
Indeed. I was walking to my hotel when I saw this. Very nice to see. Nice work, not a simple sticker on a door but a real lightboard like others in the street.
For those who are interested it's near lavender station going to Arab street. I can find the address if needed.

This is TV. 95% of people watching TV doesn't understand anything by listening but they need to see easy things to activate their poor brain.

It's a non sense to speak about American bitcoiners only. Bitcoin is used worldwidely

Because it handle bip39 and bip44 and you can generate your seed elsewhere, then enter it on device
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:25:47
I personally prefer S3X
@_date: 2018-10-17 06:45:00
It's not secure, key is accessible from malware. With a ledger the signing process is fully operated by device, and with a physical button to validate. The key never go outside the device.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:24:35
Is there any people outside America's border ?
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:21:38

I put few hundred dollars in bitcoin years ago instead of play at lottery each week of my whole life.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:17:05
I recommand 5% but personally I can spend 10 or 20% in it because I know the tech and I like risks.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:20:51

Im from European area, I buy my bitcoins in euros but it is easier for me to track it in dollar, follow Reddit discussions in dollars, forums in dollars, Android apps in dollar... I just need to do a mental conversion in euros when I buy.

 I gifted an empty big box to my brother. When he opened it he found 3 big qr code pasted inside the box : 1/ a cold paper wallet qr code. 2/ a qrcode link to Wikipedia bitcoin page 2/ a QR code link to Android wallet.
He discovered Bitcoin during months then sold it with a x16 gain
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:45:36

That's true. There is no significant technical difference between both, as far I know

Yes it is possible to have multiple accounts but everyone will be able to spend BTC on all account
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:42:35

I gifted 0.5 to my bro when it was 1btc = $250.
For this, I made an empty gift box with some qr codes inside :
- a paper wallet
- a Wikipedia link to bitcoin page
- a link to an Android mobile wallet
He quickly understood how to get bitcoin into mobile.
He hodled until now and discovered this great technology.
He is very happy :)

Paris and west subburb are safe. For other side you should search in Google because there are a few cities with high criminalities.

I use great Android app blockfolio to get instant total balance of all my crypto wallets. Plus a libre office sheet to track details on a daily basis.

But fiat protocol is owned by only one central bank. Crypto protocol is owned by 50% of miners
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:14:47
A) I live and work in Paris there is no more particular risk than other european states. Don't be affraid. Area is big and statistically you wont be in danger.
B) I don't know but my feeling is Frenchies don't use so much bitcoin. Anyway I hodl.
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:19:00
If someone is in Paris, there is the sof's bar which accept bitcoins
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:03:21
Syntax error;
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:03:11
Because crypto currency tokens cannot be printed more than the protocol define
