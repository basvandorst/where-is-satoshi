People in India just want the profits. They don't understand the technology nor it's vision. Sad.

India is a scoialist democratic shit hole country with tribalistic caste based reservation system. I don't expect much from them.

It is already a shit hole.

mempool -&gt; which represents the pending transactions in the system. Look how they spiked and are now slowly going away. Some party polluted it with fake transactions to create FUD so as to pump up bitcoin cash.

Once the wallstreet jumps on trading bitcoins, that is - when people start ordering bitcoins over phone, I expect the bitcoin value to go over 15k$ easily.

I already have coinbase and it is the worst. 
I buy bitcoin and it takes over 8 days to get deposited in my account. 
on top it, they don't seem to have the coinbase account so every transaction has to go to and from my bank - which is terrible. 
what do you think about gemini?
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:48:08
Don’t do it. As much as I like bitcoin to go up, it is a risky investment. Invest an amount which if gone doesn’t affect your way of life. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:37:07
Ah! I think I understand the rational really well. 
When the bitcoin protocol was formed, they had this limit for a reason. To keep things as distributed as possible and avoid spamming with fake transactions. Again, if you want cheaper transactions move to litecoin not a modified bitcoin. And on top of it, bitcoin cash taking over bitcoin name? This is fraud. Hopefully, this will never come to fruition as all exchanges won’t agree to it.

Right. 
The very tough problem to solve is double spending. If you have some system 'x' - how do you make sure a particular 'value' isn't spent twice? 
In order to know whether a coin has already been spent, involves you to have the knowledge of the entire system. this isn't scalable because as a sole user of giga-bitcoin, I cannot keep track of everyone and every transaction in the world - It would be just too much data. 
Now if it is distributed, you still need some consensus to convey the entireity of network that transaction did happen and this is where off chain solutions come in to picture.
So you use block chain as a source of truth and for settlements of disputes but other than that you will have special contracts between the parties participating in the transaction and the network then, can truly scale exponentially.

I believe you are looking at their public keys to draw this conclusion. What I don't understand is where I can trade these coins instantaneously? 
I am using coinbase now and it takes fucking 9 days for the transaction to complete! wtf!

It was never seen as a scalable payments solution. It worked till now because of the small user base which adopted it. The only way forward is offchain solution. Lightning networks, riddle etc,. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:35:43
but infact it isn't, IMHO. 
Because Bitcoin supports 300k transactions per day. By increasing the block size, bitcoin cash is at max able to support 2 million transactions per day. Compare this to VISA which processes around 170 million transactions per day. Both of these coins are no where close to it. 
The price of bitcoin isn't set by the transaction support but instead it is treated as the new 'gold' -&gt; by that logic it doesn't make sense to abandon bitcoin for bitcoin cash. What is there comes another fork with 16MB block size? will everyone switch again? This is madness. Overall, I have lost a little confidence in the crypto currencies to be the future. Atleast not in the current form.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:31:35
If you want more number of transactions use Litecoin, why bitcoin cash? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:25:19
High transaction fee is the cost of using bitcoin. It wouldn't be this high if only few people were using it or the price of bitcoin was relatively cheaper. But it is not. Bitcoin is the digital gold. 
The amount of transactions support by the bitcoin network does not explain the market cap. So everyone is veiewing it as gold which can be cashed out anywhere in the world in time of need. 
and yes, lightning network would solve micro/nano transaction problem but it takes time to get there

Not that I know of.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:30:25
To put it simply, bitcoin cannot support 'many' transactions. 
It can only support a max of around 300,000 transactions per day which are nowhere close for mainstream adoption. That is why it is being treated as gold as of today. 
for micro payments and even, nano payments - lightning network solves that problem.
Having limited number of transactions is the price you pay for having truly distributed currency. They are two sides of the same coin. you cannot have both.

Be careful while using these new clients. Use your bitcoin address which has the smallest amounts in it. Incase it is compromised, all of your coins won't be affected.

LN won't solve everything but it helps to scale transaction throughput exponentially with reduced transaction guarantee. How is that bad?
