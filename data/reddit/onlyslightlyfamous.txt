Unless you somehow already have the equipment and live in an area where energy costs are low, BTC mining cannot be called "buying bitcoin at a slight discount".  is giving a correct answer to the OP's question: buying BTC mining equipment is expensive and the difficulty of mining is going up; its not something that the small players and late-comers can really get into at this point without taking a loss.

Well, there are probably some around here that can explain this better but to me it works like this: I bought a little over 1.5 BTC back in November.  If I'm only buying BTC as an investment then I can look at it like I have invested $1500 USD in hopes that the BTC price will continue to go up and I will get a return on investment.  With that mindset, I would not want to spend any of my BTC because I know for every dollar I have in there, I can pull two dollars out (assuming, just for fun, a rise in price to $3000 USD in the near future).
However, personally I bought BTC for two reasons; one being as an experiment in investing and the other being because I believe that BTC will be huge in the future and I want to help build BTC as a viable currency.  One way to help increase the stability of BTC is to spend it wherever you can, thus encouraging more and more vendors to accept BTC as a form of payment.
So with that in mind, what I've been doing is spending BTC at a few online stores (I don't have anything local yet, but I'm working on it) and then replenishing what I've spent by buying that amount back on Coinbase.  The only real negative to this process is, what happens if I spend $20 USD worth of BTC on a pair of Alpaca socks while the price is low, and then in the next hour the price of BTC jumps a hundred dollars or so?  It's a gamble sometimes but, again, I see BTC as viable currency and its a gamble that I am willing to take.
Does that answer your question?
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:04:32
Funny enough, if you had asked me what my price was 6 months ago, I wouldve told you that I'd never have a price...  
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:20:50
I'm not an expert but I've been around this sub for a while and I've researched your basic question a lot.  The short and simple answer is, yes, it is too late to invest in Bitcoin mining if your goal is to make money.  You will end up spending a lot of money on dedicated mining hardware that may or may not take months to get to you, and then, even once you have it, your energy costs to run it will eat up whatever potential profit you might make.
At this point in the game, the best thing you can do if your goal is only to make money through BTC, is to buy some BTC and wait for the price to go up.

To the general public, the people who need to adopt cryptocurrencies if we want BTC to become bigger, Litecoin and Peercoin don't exist.  But Dogecoin is popping up in conversation in far more places these days then I ever expected.  
If my aunt or grandfather or sister are using Facebook or Twitter and somebody tips them Dogecoin, they will become curious and probably learn more about it.  They might have fun with it.  They might see how great cryptocoins are and then eventually they might move onto using Bitcoin.  
But, in all probability, they will never ever hear about Litecoin or Peercoin on Twitter or Facebook.  Nobody will ever tip them in Litecoin or Peercoin or Bitcoin on those social sites.  
Dogecoin can have an annoying appearance.  It can look like a joke to somebody who is heavily involved in BTC.  But its far easier to get into and people are encouraged to have fun with it and learn about it much better than they are if they are dealing with BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-17 21:28:45
This is a nice, simple app.  There arent many BTC price trackers on IOS (especially for free) so this is nice to have.
A few suggestions: 
1. This wasnt too difficult to figure out but, some users might benefit from having some simple tutorial as an intro to show how to enter the amount of BTC to track and to show how to change what currency you want to see your BTC value in.
2. A very cool feature that I'd love to see you implement would be to have the app's icon show the current BTC value.  Something that could update every minute (or 10).  It would allow me to assess the value of my BTC by simply looking at my home screen and not actually having to open the app.
3. Show the user, somewhere on the screen, where the market data is coming from.  The only reason I know it is Coinbase is because I saw your answer to another user.  A lot of users that download your app might not ever see this Reddit post and thus won't know that you are using Coinbase's market value.
4. Move the text showing the value and amount of BTC up further.  I'm looking at it right now and I just feel that it might be a little easier to look at if it were up a little higher.  Of course, if you don't have any other data on the screen that might make the bottom portion of the screen seem a bit empty and so....
5. Give us more data to put on the screen as an option.  Maybe something like a ticker or another line that simply shows the current value of 1 BTC.  It seems like you want to keep this simple so I understand if thats not what you're going for. 
Besides all of that, I want to say again: This is a nice, simple, clean looking app that does what it advertises.  Thank you for spending the time to create it and for making it available for us!
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:01:54

It was a weird way to word it but, he just means you can see the value of the amount of BTC you own.  Or whatever number you input.

He is literally metaphorically leaving money on the table here.
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:31:09
I would imagine so but I can't give you a solid answer to that question.  I don't know quite enough about mining pools.

I bought a btc last Wednesday from Coinbase.  They told me it would be a week before I saw the btc in my account.  All day yesterday I kept checking my account.  Coinbase waited until the very hour that I purchased my btc 7 days prior to make the transfer...  I dont know if they do that to everyone but, it was almost exactly 7 days.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:08:20
Don't post shit like this.  The article looks to be baseless and honestly isnt taking into account the fluctuations that BTC has seen in the last year.  The drop happening right now isnt a big deal.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:47:28
Look, might be a little harsh here but, he's dead on.  The fuck would anybody here know?  I've learned one big thing by being on this subreddit: Nobody here knows shit about predicting the BTC market.  Seriously.  We can all guess all day but our opinions are worthless and the only person that can judge whether or not you should buy more BTC today is you. 
 Do you have extra money just sitting around doing shit all?  Buy some BTC!  Did your grandma die yesterday and leave you some money?  Buy some BTC!  Just successfully kidnap a child and collect the ransom?  Buy a new identity and then buy some BTC!
I'm joking but I'm not.  Markets change a lot.  BTC is in the news more this month than ever in its history (I think) and the market is going to fluctuate some.  Its bound to happen.  Use your judgement or hire a financial adviser to help you out but don't look for good investment advice on this subreddit when it comes to BTC because we are all in the same boat as you.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:38:05
I second the recommendation for Ally.  I've been buying BTC with my Ally account and they havnt said anything to me.  Their customer service has been top notch so far with myself and my wife.  And I've seen more growth on my checking and savings account from their interest rates in a few months than I ever saw with my local banks.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:13:11
I bought in right at $1000.  The numbers this morning don't scare me a bit. They only encouraged me to get on coinbase and buy up a few more mBTC.  If the value falls any further today, I'm going in even deeper.  
My point is, BTC is here to stay and even for those of us who came to the table late, there is plenty of food left.
Stay cool.  Don't panic sell.  Get away from the computer today (or for the next couple of days).  And don't put in any money that you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:34:11
Haha, 1.2k BTC Anonymous?
I laugh but I really am certain that there are a lot of people out there like us that bought at that amount and arent feeling so great about it.  
Me?  I have faith that even if I don't see some sort of amazing returns, that I've at least helped to cement the future of a great alternative currency.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:23:22
I had the same issue when I first started out too.  Not being from Canada, I don't have any good suggestions but I'm sure there are others around here that can help.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:19:24
The only coin I might invest in as a side-bet: Litecoin.  And the only reasoning I have behind that is that as the value of BTC goes up, so will the value of LTC (to a point).  To me LTC would be a short term investment just to diversify my investment and to give me a short-term, quick gain on my money.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:43:22
You are not alone.  One day, we will be vindicated.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:17:43
All I can say is this: Don't invest in BTC with money that you can't afford to lose.  Don't use money that should be paying bills or buying food for BTC purchases.  
Unless you plan on buying BTC and then using it to make said food purchases.  In that case, have a blast!
Seriously though, everything I've learned by watching this over the last two years is that there are two camps of thought on BTC: It is an investment that might make a little money for you; It is a currency of the future that shouldnt be seen as an investment so much as a new tool to be used.  
I for one fall into a bit of both camps.  I love using my BTC to make purchases.  Its so easy and quick and I always feel really cool buying something with my BTC.  But whenever I buy something with BTC, I try to replace the amount that I spent on the chance that BTC takes another huge leap in value.  I'd hate to spend down to only a few mBTC and then see the value climb up 10x or 20x its current value.  I'd feel like I sank my own boat.
TL;DR - If you dont have any truly expendable income at the moment, don't by BTC with the mindset that it's going to make you rich.  If you've got only a few dollars, don't be afraid to buy some mBTC and learn in the process.  Also, don't be afraid to spend a littl BTC here and there.  It helps everyone!

I use Coinbase and it seems pretty easy...  I know not everyone can use Coinbase (especially those outside of the US) but, the technology is not to blame for that.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:51:47
I really think this is a cool idea.  What kind of price are we talking about?  
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:05:27
Look, I can't profess to see the future.  I won't really try.  But BTC is at a good price right now compared to where its speculated to be heading.  Buy what you can afford today and be happy with it.  Don't "wait for a price drop" and watch the value shoot up next week.
If you are waiting for a pre-determined value before buying in, you might not ever get to buy any BTC.  Don't be one of those guys who tells his grandchildren, "I remember when BTC was valued at $900.  If only I had bought one bitcoin, I would be a millionaire right now."  
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:27:53
No problem.  If you have any other concerns or questions feel free to ask or search on this subreddit.  There is a wealth of good information out there (and some really awful information if you are not careful).

I just bought 1.087 BTC myself and I'm so excited.  I've been learning as much about BTC as I can for the last few months and finally decided that just watching it go up wasnt going to do me any favors.
I've got a secure, paper-wallet all setup and I cant wait to start finding ways to use BTC in my day-to-day life.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:08:09
The simple answer is that if those of us who own BTC will spend it, it will only help to show its value as a currency.  As more businesses see that we are willing to spend BTC, more businesses will be willing to accept BTC as payment for their goods and/or services.

I see the logic that you're using and I won't argue with it.  LTC will never be as valuable as BTC for a few different reasons but, the little bit of money I've put into LTC alongside BTC has allowed me to buy more BTC recently.  
I'm not saying that everyone should buy LTC and I feel very certain that it won't last in the long run.  But, since OP asked about mining or purchasing altcoins, the only one I can recommend is LTC.  
Now, I've heard a few things about Peercoin (PPC) here and there but I honestly don't know enough about it to recommend it to anyone.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:52:57
This is a great layman's explanation!  I'll have to use this when I'm explaining this particular aspect of BTC.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:46:49
I bought my first BTC when the value was just under $1000.00.  I bought some more last week when the value dipped down into the $800's and then this weekend when the value was at $680.  
I've not been on this ride long but it sure has been a fun one so far.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:22:35
What is happening right now, is not a crash.  This is the second article from the Huffingtonpost stating such and I've got the idea that this is just a good sensationalist headline to jump on... 
Seriously though, quit posting stupid shit like this.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:11:40
Well, that's hard to say.  As someone who holds BTC and wants it to succeed, it's good to spend it because it increases the awareness and ultimate value of BTC.  
Beyond that it's a little more subjective but I'll tell you what I've enjoyed when I have used BTC to buy things:
It's fast.  Almost instantly I can see my coin leave my wallet and get confirmation from the person I've sent coin to that they have gotten it.
It's secure.  I send coin from my wallet to an address generated only for me.  Nothing is stored on servers at the shop that can compromise my BTC.  
It's fun.  Again, this is subjective but, the idea and act of spending digital currency is so cool.  It makes me feel like I'm taking part in something historic and futuristic at the same time.
Now, will these points apply to you?  I don't know.  Maybe you'll even find other things about using BTC as a currency that you enjoy.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:28:53
I did.  I bought in at just under the $1000 mark and got exactly that when they withdrew the money from my account.
