Ehh how reliable is it?

Yeah I think paypal will be a option. 
Mainly going for companies as the minimum order would be 20 stickers totalling around 30 dollars. (That's including shipping and tax) 
But they are good quality stickers, water and dishwasher proof and leaves no residue when being removed.
Does that sound like a reasonable price range?

Can I ask how much bitcoin you own currently?

Thanks for the help its finally sorted, I think its because someone sent me money with a low fee and I used that money on certain things so it was waiting for the original money to be confirmed?

Im mining on Slush's pool but I have no idea about mining rounds. How long does a mining round usually last?

Well most google searches of average pc electric uses is about 90 cents a day if left on for 24 hours. But I think mine would be about 2 dollars a day if I left it on mining? What do you reckon?
