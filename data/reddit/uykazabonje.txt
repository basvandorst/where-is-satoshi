"it is also too late to create your own cryptocurrency, because it will fail" wtf haha, if you think there will be only bitcoin left in 10 years time, you are deluded

Where the fuck does it say that you have to be 18+ to have btc on your wallet? There are no laws for holding BTC... There are some sites on which you need to have KYC, there you maybe have to be 18+ (or any other legal age) but there are a lot of pages without KYC so you can have your btc without any problems... And you can hold it till you reach your legal age and then sell it. And you have said "just" 1k$ so I think you don't have "just" 1k in your bank, or where do you point with "spend more money than you have"...

I was 17 when i started mining... If you really wanted to buy it or invest in it, there is always a way. Find someone who can and give them the money. Not that I suggest that haha but there is always a way

If bitcoin dumps to 2000 I will sell my house and buys bitcoins with it.

Perfect response hahah

I didnt say any of these two is a blockchain... But they run on blockchain, and don't have any tokens staking or mining.
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:30:36
Who said anything about it being useful? You can implement it without cryptocurrency even if it is useless. That is my point.
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:52:03
You have just proved me correct, there can be a blockchain without cryptocurrencies... But here are some examples with blockchain implemented without a cryptocurrency to support it:

You invested like 40$ and need to post it on reddit? I will never get what is going on in the heads of people like you lol. Are you so desparate for attention or? Not hating but legit I'm just curious
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:50:12
lol, funny that you think otherwise.
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:33:11
I'm not here to argue, but I know I'm correct. You CAN have a blockchain without crypto currency, It's usefulness wasn't discussed by me.
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:10:41
What? you are saying there is no blockchain without a cryptocurrency on it? Maybe you need to do more digging lol. And no, they do not need each other. Only cryptocurrency needs blockchain but not the other way arround. That is like saying electricity needs Electric Vehicles... No, EV's need electricity.
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:17:26
Named two of them, one comment higher. Read about it before you trust someone on reddit saying it's NOT on blockchain...

Well you mother wouldn't be able to use internet 10-15 years ago could she? The countries with unbanked people will start the revolution not mothers of the middle class...

Oh yes you can, send it to genesys block
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:40:01
So you are saying that this shop withdraws their money every single day? dont bullshit me haha ATM's like these turn over arround 10k a year, who has the time and the will to withdraw it every day. Maybe in few years they will withdraw it every day, but not now.
@_date: 2019-10-17 14:37:28
The people downvoting my comment have to go to back to school and listen to math and their common sense a bit more
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:32:12
inside atm's there is still cash...
@_date: 2019-10-22 14:40:40
I think you will get disappointed very quickly with your "get rich quick scheme" mentality...
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:47:10
Maybe because no one uses it? And why would you, to get ripped off for 20% fees? Don't know who is a bigger thief, the owner of these atms or the stupid burglars. And you haven't corrected me on anything lol. I said that inside atms there is cash, you said there isn't. Don't know who is in the wrong here... Have a good one!
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:27:09
A lot of people lose their coins because of their own stupidity and then blame it on coinbase.

"banks the unbanked", more like: "Unbanks everyone"

If the demand stays the same as it is now, after the halving will result in the rise of price because of smaller inflation.

Ok so people who are working with me aren't looking forward to altcoin season? or what are you trying to tell me, I don't get it haha
@_date: 2019-10-03 07:45:39
What you are talking about is 5 decades in the future, and I'm talking about the present
@_date: 2019-10-03 07:48:49
Well that is up to the owners of the atm to regulate, only because of this problem we didn't go for this ATM business in our country... When the regulatory will become more strict all of these atms will be banned or illegalized. Just think about how easy it would be for us regular folk to launder money, that's too dangerous for the big fish(they have the banks to do it for them).
@_date: 2019-10-08 10:45:28
210 days is not 6 months
@_date: 2019-10-02 12:08:44
The problem isn't running out of cash but money laundering laws. The government wouldn't like to see people withdrawing 10k in cash 'from thin air'.

no limit on withdraws or on deposits? It probably isn't legal to withdraw limitlessly. I know it will turn over a lot of money in the future, but not right now.

you clearly have no idea about nodes. He isn't talking about mining with raspberry pi.

Check out Pundi-x and their XPOS terminal. I think it's perfect for shops.
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:01:03
Not a fucking chance.
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:12:01
Are they using XPOS from Pundi - x?
