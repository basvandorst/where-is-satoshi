Okay, thanks for the advice! For future reference, how much would you recommend sending in a fee?
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:54:32
Thank you!

What are these?
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:33:37
Yikes. Well I guess all I can do is wait, right?
@_date: 2013-07-04 03:13:45
Thank you for the answer. I guess I was expecting a little more of a rise in price (closer to $120), and wasn't expecting such a sudden drop. I wasn't sure what effect the Mt. Gox/US Government stuff was having, or if bitinstant being a bunch of dipshits was doing anything either.

Shit, that's worrisome. Last few times I've done it its taken an hour max for all six. Are there help services?
@_date: 2013-07-04 03:28:35
Well, thats terrifying. Honestly, things aren't looking good.

I don't think it was the bank that did most of the snooping in all honesty.

@_date: 2013-04-03 21:56:37
Fuck. Okay. I had deadlines. Thank you for your help.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:37:29
Okay, thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:44:56
Yeah, mine just worked. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:26:47
I did not because it was a little over one coin. Should I have...?
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:16:48
What do you mean by private keys? I'm using Bitcoin-qt, and it says I no longer have the funds I sent in that account, and lists my transaction. The problem is that I still, hours later, have 0 confirmations of that transaction. Blockchain sees that the transaction took place, but also lists is as unconfirmed.

Thank you!
