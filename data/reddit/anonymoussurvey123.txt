How is it a scam?

You're quite right on that last sentence. I didn't think of that.

For the most recent comments, I apologise. I wanted it to be as anonymous as possible. I'm conducting a study regarding the use of bitcoin and other Crypto-currencies within the United Kingdom. If you are from the UK and would be willing to help with my study, could you please complete the survey. [ Please note that the survey is completely anonymous and I have given the option where necessary to not disclose any answers you wish to keep discreet. (Just select other and state you'd prefer not to say)

I'm writing a report on the use and adoption of cryptocurrency in the digital age. Originally, it was going to be UK focused but I wasn't getting enough data. If I can get enough i'll collate and post it here in a graph for the community :)

I absolutely agree with this comment. It is totally meant to be anonymous.

Apologies if you felt like it was intrusive. It's mean't to be harmless.

Thanks for those that so far have done the survey, please up vote if you can too. 
I hope to get at least 1000 responses and I need your community support to do that.
Good luck all!

Everyone is involved, for as long as they have a bitcoin address.

I'm hoping the winner will post.
