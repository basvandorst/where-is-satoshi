Does the update mean that every time you attempt to send Bitcoin to sell, it repeats the following, ["I sorry Dave I'm afraid I can't do that"](
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:12:48
I'm not a mod or have enough time to explain Bitcoin, however! in layman's terms the world financial markets are going tits up, the bankster's have raped the masses, and the [world is in debt up to it's eyeballs and the clock is ticking]( and the only way out is Bitcoin.
Normally the corrupt governments and their arse wipe politicians get the masses to pay that debt, but they have run out of future generations to load it onto, and cannot print enough money to pay the interest, "welcome Zimbabwean currency"  it's fucked.
1 Bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 units called Satoshi's each Satoshi will eventually reach parity with a USA Dollar, so how much will 1 Bitcoin be worth in the future?, you do the math's.
The reason the media is demonising Bitcoin is because the banksters and the corrupt elite were late to the party, yet behind the BS and FUD they're buying it. When the dumb masses and sheeple wake up to the fact of what is going on it will be to late to buy a bitcoin below $100,000 $1,000,000 or whatever the price it is.
So $100 or £100 pound now is sweetie or Friday night out money, you can buy a bit of a Bitcoin now and forget about it.

I liked to concur, but I don't believe that to be the case, there are whales, traders in cheap shiny suits, investors, speculators, and your Joe Public end user, all with different motivations.
However! there are also government subordinate shills bankster types that want to destroy Bitcoin by any means necessary, and the weapon of choice right now is shorting... but this is only a temporary hindrance, until they run out of coins.  
@_date: 2018-12-18 09:40:17

Cool article, however! Bitcoin has a steeper hurdle to overcome than earlier inventions, the tool of the beast **FIAT**. In light of this fact we are at Defcon 2 in FUD lies and deceit from all corrupt Governments and their privately controlled MSM propagandist outlets.
The enslaved are handcuffed by TAX and FIAT the weapon of choice of Bankster's, subordinates to their enslavement masters. 
The genius of Bitcoin is the fact that it will be the last non violent answer to freedom, but that journey will be arduous but not impossible.
Everyday Bitcoin is above ground is a good day, and makes it stronger. 
Buckle up! what you are witnessing is historic, the biggest transfer of wealth in human history, and subsequently a small crack in the wall of the dam, that does not retain water but of humanity itself.

Value is subjective, I cannot fully predict the future, but I can see some of the past, and most of it is BS! yeah! I went to school I was educated aka indoctrination I digress ;-) 
Lets for example look at "Gold". If you had been stranded on a desert island for 1 week that had nothing except sand, and you had the chance to save 1 of 2 boxes washed up on the shore and 1 contained six bars of Gold and the other contained 6 Bottles of water which one would you say had the greater value?
As for Bitcoin it has scarcity they will only ever be 21 Million, and 2.1 Quadrillion Satoshi's, nobody can print anymore,. Everybody can see the ledger, if you want to pay TAX for roads, well  no corrupt wanker/politician Councillor can line his pockets without everyone seeing, If you're tired of bombing people back to the stoneage so people can make profit from the manufacture of arms ,Bitcoin is the answer.
