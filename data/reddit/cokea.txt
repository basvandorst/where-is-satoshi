So funny!!! XD

Bitcoin only has to outperform Berkshire Hathaway on a % basis in order for "yes" to win ("surpass BKA as an **investment**"), not that a single BTC has to be worth $185,000. This bet is poorly worded on purpose.

As an Adword advertiser, I have to disagree. From my experience, every advertisements are checked before getting approved. Google Adword team thus definitely checked and enabled an advertisement for a phishing page.

They hold all coins in cold storage so I don't think your coins are lost. However there's indeed a bug, I have 0.2 coins that disappeared

**FINAL UPDATE: Almost full conversation (the japanese Google Translate part didn't get record unfortunately):  - Please excuse the french accent and thank you MtGox!**
I like the second song. 9/10. Will live update with more impression.
*UPDATE:* The song n°4 is good as well. 8/10. How many more did they plan?
*UPDATE:* The song n°6 is very bad. A mix of sauna/8 bits song sped up. 2/10.
*UPDATE:* The song n°7 is a minimalist piano song with an 1/2 beat on the background. Catchy. 6/10
*UPDATE:* Back to the beginning. After listening to an 19 minute playlist elevator music, I feel relaxed and appeased. Thank you MtGox. I will keep providing live updates.
*UPDATE:* A live stream of this wonderful playlist -  Enjoy guys!
*UPDATE:* The first song sounds even better the second time you hear it. The saxophone solo always gets to me. 8.5/10
*UPDATE:* More information regarding the second song, reminds me of old Soviet Russia park music. 9 to 9.5/10! 
*UPDATE:* Missed the update on the third song. Skype's lag speed it up giving it a very nice random effect. The songs live and evolve with you! A bit too simple for my taste though, 4/10.
*UPDATE:* The complete list (of the 4 first songs, you can complete the playlist with the link above):  - Enjoy!
*UPDATE:* The soothing sentiment is disappearing as song n°6 started. Reduced to 2/10.
*UPDATE:* In the eventuality the operators do not speak english, I will be using Google Translate voice bot to talk directly to the operator in japanese.
*UPDATE:* Despite having prepared -linksnipofgoogle- and using the bot, a very nice lady replied to my call in english. Some personal information were shared so bear with me while I filter my name out.

Same here. I filled all the details correctly. Sent a SEPA transfer of XXXX euros 7 days ago, still didn't hear about them. They ignored all my tickets aswell.

Lol thanks for Google Translate, but the announcement was posted as an image

Issue resolved. They funded my account.
