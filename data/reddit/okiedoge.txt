Try and get a home loan (or most loans) from a bank. It's a bunch of keystrokes they make on your behalf, unless they're paying you with a check that may or may not be given in whole or part with fiat cash. Generally, it would be deposited and handled.....electronically!

Too many alt dates on the test, although Doge was extremely simple for me. I was a first-day Shibe on 12/8/13. Much sleepy after becoming Dogeillionaire next day. Such W0W! (Waiting to howl at eclipse tomorrow.)
Consider adding material regarding;
1) How often is the Bitcoin "halvening"?
2) How often does the difficulty factor in Bitcoin change?
3) How many BTC are estimated lost?
4) What is a Merkle Tree?
5) When will the 21 Million BTC finally have been mined?
The latter is especially problematic for media types whom believe they're already minted. Such ignorance indeed makes me cringe. I think  is onto something here. Having a ticker symbol is relevant or have a choice of answers and match in that regard. I scored 18/28. Not a bad test overall!

If you tell anyone about your cryptos, do NOT tell them how much of what you have and DO warn them of the volatility, so if they get into it, they're not whirlpooled as too many noobz are. This remains a heavy-duty subject for the uninitiated. Just Sayin'!

.05 of what? BTC? USD? If you're disclosing what you have, you're above the Plankton category and actually have a start. I'd keep building that as I can, especially after SegWit &amp; LN have those fees to a mere fraction of on-the-chain. 
Of course you're not going to find out the exact amount of what I hold today as that's my jellyroll, but it's definitely in the Crab category. During 2013, it was well into the Lobster category. Some I gambled away, some I won back, some I spent, I did really well and reported gains to the IRS 4 years ago and have pretty much HODL'ed or spent some of it on services or certain products. To use BTC in transactions in the past was really awesome and liberating. Of course there's LTC and some other crypto I HODL now as well.

And you've forgotten already that Bitcoin is truly international. You're trying your best to FUD this up, but too many have skin in the game, something which you likely DON'T.

I didn't know of this chart, but as you've seen - I didn't need it. :-) 
Since I'm putting together a non-credit crypto course (with Bitcoin as my emphasis) for the public at a local college, this is good enough to add to my presentation. The "Halvening" as it's called occurs around every three and a half years and is already a part of one of my presentations. My  emphasis of the course will be on coin security and cold storage, although I like some of the hardware Trezors showing up. I'll even touch on BIP 38 but haven't started on that one yet.
The tricky part seems to be passwords! A former roommate bought a bunch of Doge last year and missed out on a $7,000 cashout, although he'll get a second wind in the months ahead IMHO. Still, his $150 input has over $3,500 awaiting him if he can recall the password he made up while visiting me. Hypnotherapy maybe?? The Keiser Report episode E1167 on YouTube is a hilarious example.

However, that goes back to something that too few pay heed to, especially today: You shouldn't believe everything you see on the internet! There can be value in taking classes for this as long as the instructor(s) has/have actual, verifiable experiences in the material taught.

Not what I have in mind. I understand BCC has too many issues. I'm watching certain ICOs where new blockchains are in development. Although risky, if the best team makes a superior mousetrap, so-to-speak, it could take away at least some of ETH's value.

Although correct, there are usually fees associated with it. Not in all cases, but those fees do add up. A bank has to make a profit and interest rates going below zero isn't helping them at all. I did get rid of one bank who was using a third-party service to encourage customers to buy insurance and other garbage I had no need in getting. I was one of the few who complained and probably got a SAR wrote out on me. Good Riddance to Northwest Bank, backstabbing scum!

Even so, does the bank or savings and loan have any real duty to handle the entire transaction in a fiat means? It's a "fractional reserve" fiat system today for a reason and it does present cost savings, even if not the most intelligent means. If everyone insisted on total fiat settlement today, the banks runs out too fast. That's all I'm getting at as I keep some fiat outside of the banks, especially with the War On Ca$h going on in several nations, India in particular (they're very underbanked, so their new policy went over like a turd in a punch bowl to so many.) Sweden is basically cashless and several others are closing in. Concerns of a currency going into a blockchain ledger could affect everyone's privacy. It's like a credit card without the credit factor, but the transactions would be fully trackable and there's no escape. At least with full fiat, there's still some privacy today.

 you're SPOT-ON! Indeed, Bitcoin is learning-intensive for so many reasons and there's still not that perfect app which Granny can understand. In fact, the crypto which does that first (and securely for that matter) could outdo most if not all existing cryptos, if a crypto is already high on the food chain, the right app could even propel it over Bitcoin. 
Don't laugh, as CoinBase still hasn't caught on to what it should've already picked up on months ago!
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:23:26
The course I plan to submit to a local college for a non-credit presentation won't show some of the "vegetables" (as taught early in the excellent Princeton College course) of how crypto, Bitcoin in particular, works "under the hood" until the end of the initial course when they are better able to put those pieces into the puzzle and not giving up too fast. Their wallet and security should come first IMHO. My mindset is to not overload my students at the first, most whom aren't deep into computer science, but to teach them why Bitcoin is relevant and how much of that applies to other cryptocurrencies. It's bad enough that there's still not an app good enough for Granny to understand with available exchanges, registration/KYC API, USD or related currency settings, alert messages, help screens and more. I'm a 50-something whose mother lives hundreds of miles away and she still uses a dialup on a very small Win 7 laptop with no real interest in learning this. If she were to start learning and had no guidance on what to learn first, it'd take much more time to piece it all together, versus someone who has been at this a while. I started mining bitcoin late in '09.

Understand that not all attorneys carry specialization in what you ask (I'm not one either), as these laws varies with where you live. There are two forms of "theory" I suspect they can use. 
Reasonable suspicion is where the cop believes his education and training are strong enough to justify the search. Legally, it's a stretch but once cases using it have been successfully processed, a PRECEDENT has been set. Get it? 
Probable cause is where conditions show the cop there's likely something illegal going on, such as the stench of weed or alcohol, seeing rolling papers, you get the basic drift.
Finally, if you're in an area with Civil Asset Forfeiture, you don't have to violate any law. Your money or property did that for you! You won't be charged with anything but lose your property if the cop even suspects they were use in a crime and it can be quite costly to get your stuff back. Hope this helps.

What surprises me the most is that nobody here shows the desire to retort the bank's comments (disclaimer: they may well shut your account down, but they'll get the message) with;
 "Louise,
You have not stated specifically which of your policies I am in violation. Your response appears too vague to consider in light of such omissions and contains no legal citations. I would like my attorney to review further correspondence regarding these matters, which are legal in the United States under IRS guidance 2014-21. 
It's my understanding that banks facilitate money laundering with no more than stiff fines as punishment, then business as usual continues. Your colleague in banking, Jamie Dimon, told Senator Elizabeth Warren during an argument to the effect to "fine him" if his bank was breaking the law, that he can afford it. This bank's attitude toward customer service is proof positive that I don't matter to you. I may be forced to change to another bank. At that time, do not attempt to ascertain why I made such a choice if you wish to avoid the rude response your vague, canned missive deserves. Your side of securing my money doesn't allow for appropriate transparency under the law, anyhow and Congress has voted against the people regarding your practices."

If you have a Dogecoin wallet, I'll gladly tip you for the comment.
You've NAILED IT so well! I publicly warned people in 2009 about these unbacked mountains of paper garbage derivatives which make bankers a lot in fees, yet even those with backing are often found as flimsy at best. Jim Sinclair has warned so many for even longer. Consider it was the repeal of Glass-Steagal under Clinton's watch that allowed these suited madmen out of the box where they belong - each of them! 
Among the reasons for the '08 bailout, derivatives are a huge part of a gigantic casino and has gotten worse to the tune of globally at least 700 trillion or possibly as high as 1.1+ quadrillion dollars. The irony of it is that the demand for dollars will have to be met just to cover even a fraction of this amount, since most of these contracts are apparently denominated in USD. Most Sheeple haven't a clue to the massive mess and we barely hear a peep about the elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about, much less clean up after. The Market will have to do it for them, and the results won't be pretty. I predict with confidence that when it crashes, it makes '08 a walk in the park, with another World War to rearrange the puzzle pieces.

Although correct on all your points, (I invest in both, a long-time hodler) understand that there's only a set amount of BTC, ever. It's important that many have actually lost their coins through lost wallets or exchanges where the wallet.dat was lost, thus freezing the coins.
Gold is still being mined. With the degree of manipulation ongoing, most silver and a few gold mines are in C&amp;M (care and maintenance) mode. This too is unsustainable, especially the former being used in so many hi-tech applications. Silver will put on the shine, given time. I'm far more bullish on it than gold, although either will serve you well, solely in physical form and stored outside of the banking system.

I've refreshed the browser on the transaction just minutes ago. The transaction has apparently been reinstated, but still hasn't confirmed as of this posting. I'll monitor this and see what happens, but I'm presently a night owl, waking up to work. See y'all tomorrow. :)

So far, what you state in your final sentence hasn't happened. I think it wise for me to reboot my Bitcoin core wallet and see if it recalculates. As of this post, I show 416902 blocks.
I have to assume the change address likely gets any change given. I'm also curious how Bitpay sees these matters. Of course I'll coordinate with them somehow as a loss to them wouldn't be at all fair.
Regardless, this headache does bring up that wallets going forth should be dynamic and warn the user. There's at least one I've heard of doing this and I may choose that, however, I'm the only regular functional Bitcoin node for a pretty good distance (I'm way out in the sticks) and want to be part of the solution. Rick F. of Pirate Party fame said it best recently on an interview with someone in the Netherlands to paraphrase that any node lost "is a hazard to the network" and I wholeheartedly agree. BTW, that was really an awesome interview with language NSFW.

My thinking is that Bitpay likely charges enough to cover the whole enchilada, todo incluido (all inclusive) but they may not have considered my payment to them which when transmitted is normally trusted and it proceeds further. It's a potentially sticky mess if not resolved, but having experienced this, it has added some tarnish which is really unnecessary. When you run the transaction  you'll see where there's no transaction reported any longer and that it was indeed pruned. It showed as an unconfirmed transaction yesterday of under a half BTC. That's why I didn't post the public address, as it simply won't show a thing.
I did note the transaction in the original, at the very bottom:
The transaction # c28537f80dc69ddc035e36bf0c2621514d2ce869e6dc858ba2d6d6a16c2fb853
@_date: 2016-06-19 21:27:07
FINAL UPDATE: Yes, it was really strange to see a pruning, then it got revived, but it's finally resolved! I thank everyone for their input on this and hopefully it brings some food for thought going forth.
I consider this topic as resolved for now, but I do hope:
1) Payment processors depending on a payment will encourage users to include an appropriate fee to ensure it gets prompt confirmations, especially with major BTC events as the halvening and additional Chinese buying. Any huge black swan event can add to it as well.
2) That more wallets or even Blockchain or Bitcoin.org consider posting a dynamic "satochis per bit" calculator to aid those spending to render a proper fee, AND! 
3) That fees don't become an ******* "arms race" within Bitcoin, for the sake that users find a lessening benefit, even if the miners are faced with an ever-increasing difficulty multiplier to obtain fewer coins going forward.
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:05:52
UPDATE: So far, after the reboot and block 416904 showing up, the balance reflects no refund thus far.

You don't have to, but if you at least check the transaction  perhaps you can then begin to state something far more germain to this discussion.. I'm NOT here to troll anybody, so don't even begin to go there. 
Regarding my six years involvement, if that's your doubt.. I used to mine the coin through a website coded with java, (I think it was called kregminer) while a college student. I won't forget that horrible winter of '09-'10 and actually escaped malware and other nonsense due to no security of wallet 1.0 (the transaction fee at that time was recommended @ .01 BTC!)  I accomplished that through encrypting and copying the wallet.dat to another drive. That came in really handy as the HD had issues due to the subsequent 800+ mile move I made. I've purchased extra BTC during Spring, 2013 while between jobs and have done quite nicely with it. I was among the first Dogeillionaires and was a first-day adopter that December when it came out and should still have the posts on Doges.org to prove it. I've also escaped being Gox'ed and Cryptsy'ed along the way. If you have greater experience and can expand and enlighten the Class, by all means open up!
Although I frequently wear a cowboy hat and have rodeoed numerous times decades ago, this ain't my first rodeo in crypto, by any means.

You didn't really READ through this, didn't you?? Am I just wasting bits and time when I go through this, or is this just another tl;dr thingy? You may well be giving away your age on this..
Didn't I state clearly somewhere in this thread that I had one situation where I used my wallet to consolidate numerous inputs to a SINGLE input, IOW, I paid myself.
Furthermore, didn't I state earlier that I knew in the past that transactions I had made were delayed. I had NO problem with that. It was the issue of having been rejected that was it.
Cluelessness may apply to having not reinstated the fee before transmitting it, but I have additional reasons why a fee should not be necessary, in particular if a user wants to consolidate inputs to a single one. For it to work properly will compromise security to an extent though as the user would need to choose one of those existing balance addresses to be the full receiver. On that specific point, I won't budge a picometer!

These swine have effectively breached my Tenth Amendment protection in order to make military personnel access to bases in this state easier to do, despite the fact these same personnel are allowed a free passport, also recognized as a valid identification, yet would not require everybody's information to be submitted, most whom could care less about military service in the first place.

Consider too, the Bitcoins which were lost (not stolen) for various reasons; computer HD crashes, password loss to online wallets or Private key loss/corruption. That value has yet to be quantified. I even lost a fraction of a coin during a transfer to an address I no longer controlled and whose owner went out of business. The address was orphaned and I can still see it on the Blockchain to this day. I won't post it here since I don't want to be blamed for trying to obtain any BTC through it, although I literally can't.

@_date: 2016-12-27 22:03:19
Read this whole enchilada, no TL;DR'ing as I don't want you to miss any point I make: Specifically, Cold Storage is the means where you find an unused bitcoin address which you have BOTH Public and Private Keys that correspond with each other, then you move a set amount of BTC to that address. Furthermore, that address cannot be in your active, online wallet! (You may continue to add more BTC to that Public address until you reach your goal in Cold Storage) You then write down the exact and precise Private Key on a single slip of paper and securely store it. A second slip of paper gives better security in case of disaster, yet makes it twice as likely for someone to come across it and "take" your coins. There are many ways you can obtain such an unused address. If you decide to prune one out of your existing wallet, be sure ALL details regarding both Public and Private Keys are precise BEFORE you send coins to the Public address for storage. The point with Cold Storage is that you do not have it active online at all, thus the security of those coins is far greater, and unhackable if nobody "sees" the paper slip. 
Once entered, the balance you transferred remains in the BlockChain until that Private Key is entered into your personal wallet in the future when needed. You could gift it to another Bitcoin user, they entering the Private Key and claiming the funds as well. The Private Key when properly entered will "hash" down into the Public Key associated with the Private Key and when done, your wallet then contains the balance you stored, ready for spending or your choice of exchange.
Finally, you can encrypt your Private Key with BIP38 (It renders a 6z address instead of the "5" from a pure PrivKey) but you or a loved one had better, never, ever forget the passphrase used to encrypt, or those coins get LOCKED! Personally, I don't recommend such for a Cold Storage holding.
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:22:40
The best means I've used to secure Bitcoin I have is simply using Cold Storage, and I heavily recommend that over other means. I'm a bit more bold than many, having moved all my BTC to a single address which is not on any of my Bitcoin wallets, yet I have the Private Key from that address secured solely on a single sheet of paper, so it's hackproofed in regard to computers I operate. I also check the Blockchain from time to time using the Public Key address and it's still there in it's entirety. I sleep good at night.
Another alternative means is encrypting your Private Key with BIP 38. This means you'll have chosen a password or phrase you cannot forget, which increases the possibility of losing your coins. I prefer the simpler Cold Storage, but don't lose that paper!

So true, fellow hodler, so true!!
Comments coming from those who insist the moonshot happen NOW, likely have too much money tied up in their coins that they're feeling pain. This ain't the way to ride in this rodeo! 
N00bz, this isn't a game, yet it is! If you've never handled stocks before, this you'll find a lot of similarities too, except 1) on steroids [far more volatility] and 2) you won't find the degree of manipulation of endless naked shorting the banker$ thrive on.
Patience, Grasshopper.. It's digital $$ I have sitting around, most of mine is safely placed in Cold Storage, and I've timed downturns in the past and made even m0Ar! It's to the point I look and realize the price wiggles around, then Voooomm! Another mini-spike happens. Consider what pittance your wonderful bankers and their government buddies give you and it's an epiphanic slapping across your face that THIS is a game changer going forth.

When the bitcoin price drops, this experienced Bitcoiner simply says "Meh!" and awaits. The glass is only half-full. I've seen this over and over again.
The same happens to gold/silver and the metals have severe manipulation ongoing, until the COMEX/LIBOR no longer has physical metals to deliver, then it's Game Over for those riggers. It's coming... Called Shanghai, they have a physical exchange. I'll do well at that time, yet I have my coins and they continue to spark! 
Bitcoin will experience a true moonshot as it has settled in, but it's hard to pinpoint when. It's vindicating that more and more realize the power it gives. As long as governments don't mandate their own blockchain for money and eliminate fiat, it's an exciting time to be alive!

Errr.. The insurer is usually bonded by a State or related entity, and if they lost the $$, I would be willing to wager the insured party will find lawyers to fight that. You see, fraud could be alleged and that can prove quite nasty for an insurer, not to mention the time spent in court(s) of law getting it settled. 
Now I see your point regarding lower rates, but that would apply if the insurer put forth enough exclusions that the insured party can't effectively fight it. Sometimes, that's not enough though.

But....but..but, assuming there is not a War ongoing and the business was insured - they get the factory rebuilt. It's hard to destroy wealth. Generally, it's a transfer because betting with stocks and more complex means usually has people on BOTH sides of the trade. Mind you, it'll be difficult to truly short Bitcoin. The degree of manipulation can't be done through near the amount of naked shorts as COMEX is fed through the metals manipulators such as the commercials and the other TBTF's. That alone makes Bitcoin way more beautiful as it can beat that game to a pulp.

Fair enough. I am satisfied with my exchange for now. As you, I don't yet need fiat. It's cool to use BTC in buying services or stuff. I wish more HODLers understood this.
@_date: 2016-12-26 17:46:04
Not NO, but Hell NO! Use Mt. Gox and Cryptsy as historic reminders of exactly why you should never allow any exchange to be your "bank" of coins.
1) They, not you, control the Private Key for your holding.
2) BTC exchanges remain a prime target for hackers, for obvious reasons. The aforementioned exchanges got Pwn3d by different vectors, but they were hacked.
3) Axumata is spot-on regarding long-term storage, consider Cold Storage if you're a HODLer of at least some of your coins, as myself.
To conclude, any online wallet or exchange should be used only temporarily. Weigh your inherent risks whenever doing so.
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:10:51
This long-time HODLer TOTALLY gets this and feels this way, too! What I learned from Mt Gox five years ago, what I learned about using Bitcoin, even gambling with it from time to time and watching others going insane, them taking out second mortgages to chase bad bets (I watched one guy lose 7k BTC, worth 840k USD at the time, punch that button a few times too many, getting a bad seed!) Later, donating some BTC to a homeless shelter which accepted it (not a fake/fraud either) without mailing it or using any "third party" to facilitate getting the value there, then know it was received and confirmed minutes later. That was an epiphany by itself. To be among the early birds in something as this and taking that chance was unreal, but I learned what no college could've taught me at the time, and I do hold a degree.
@_date: 2016-12-27 04:18:09
In regard to Au/Ag, yes, Mike's clearly on-point. I like Maloney. I am familiar with all his guests he featured on Epi 1 except Scott. I also agree with Ahart999 that Bitcoin will benefit nicely as a result of the upcoming global collapse. Why? Bitcoin is only mildly inflationary. 16M of the 21M BTC to be mined - have been! The remaining 5M will be mined between now and 2140, assuming Bitcoin remains in place, and the limit is never modified. Consider too, the deflationary effect of those having lost coins (not having been stolen) through wallet loss or password loss, never being able to fetch them as they are effectively orphaned. Having even a few coins is already showing more power with the expanding Bitcoin ecosystem and those solid HODLers, but I still spend some. I've mentioned in these forums before that using and even gambling with it at times has been both a learning experience and liberating! What this video didn't show was what role cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin may have going into the future. I'm also unsure what opinion Maloney has on Bitcoin for now. Some of his guests are bullish on it, that I can confirm! To conclude, my Coins are only a part of what I have, and they've done way better than the phyzz I've stacked, but each should do really well in the months ahead. I'm still moving $$ outside of the bank system and into these alternatives so I have a fighting chance at surviving this collapse. I'm betting I'll reap a reward for not granting these criminal bankers too much of my power and time, even if the government should answer with a higher tax on the alternatives, if the government itself doesn't collapse! Such punishing behavior by government is one of the things my late grandfather despised the most, being punished for being resourceful, wanting to save and properly invest. It's certainly not the same America or the World he grew up in, and this upcoming global collapse will be something to behold. Assuming the internet remains viable, Bitcoin will be unbelievable and those with precious metals will benefit as well.

Furthermore, banks are at the whim of their host governments, so banking holidays have occurred. I won't even try to explain how woefully underfunded the FDIC insurance is, even when only a small amount of money flowing is physical fiat, today. Now if you truly don't care, more power to you. At least I tried to wake up a few, but I'll at least agree that too many don't give a shit. It's safe until it ISN'T!

Gold being used in Medicine? It's a fantastic tooth substitute or protector. I have several gold caps now. It's expensive in electronics. Silver has better conductivity, but Radio Shack used to sell vacuum tubes whose plug pegs were gold-plated, so there are those strange exceptions.
With all that said, GOLD is rare. It's not a strategic metal as Silver and functions fantastic as money, and if you don't believe me, ask central bankers WHY they continue to store it. It can be easily divided as it is a malleable metal when pure. In some cultures, just the spiritual connection is powerful!
This doesn't take away from Bitcoin. I've mined for coins back in late '09 on a slow desktop computer. To have spent BTC and made BTC and bought BTC is liberating! The learning curve isn't easy for most, but the ecosystem is getting better and I expect further improvements. I have several coins in Cold Storage and sleep good at night. Even if Bitcoin proves a failure, it was one of the better experiences in my life I can brag about, and it does prove there are true alternatives to get one outside of the Borg, the Matrix, the Hellhole that criminal elitist bank$ters want us to remain as debt slaves therein. 
It may not replace fiat as governments are already contemplating blockchains of their very own to track your every move and even block what they don't "approve", but it's disruptional - and I love that!

I became unemployed exactly 4 years ago this week. It was a long 8 months trying in vain to get good work, but it worked out well as I'm over 3 years employed with a Fortune 500 outfit.  During that time, Bitcoin went on it's first real tear! I lost a lot of sleep and watched MtGox with it's DDoS issues and insane peaks. Spring, 2013 was a true turnaround for BTC. I bought around 15 BTC around 35 - 40, up to 50 USD and made plenty of profits, paying taxes on those, banking the rest. I left BTC actively for a while becoming involved on the first day of Dogecoin, then moving back into Bitcoin where it's Cold Storage for now. I'm still sitting on a multi-bagger even after spending at least 60% of those Bitcoins. This was a part of my life I'll never, ever forget as I had so much fun! Disney World couldn't compare.

BTC_Forever is correct. I will add you can view the BTC blockchain via blockchain.info .. With that said, some answers:
1) essentially correct
2) The miners also assist in the security of the Blockchain through peer-to-peer sharing and verification of the information contained in the Blockchain and that of new blocks being added. The 51% you refer to is complex to describe in a short reply. This has happened with many other alt. coins (cryptocurrencies not Bitcoin) 
3) clarification.. Correct except that miners now receive (and split between themselves as part of a common group, due to the incredible difficulty to solve these blocks) 12.5 coins. This change occurred with block 420,000. I believe it halves to 6.25 coins at block 630,000 which is several years away.  Bear in mind, only 21 million coins will be mined in Bitcoin. Over 15 million have been mined already.
Finally, different uses of blockchain technology are being formulated by the Big Banks. It's extremely questionable if these blockchains will be shared publicly for transparency, or if our economies will be forced into it. I've already warned one financial analyst to be careful what he wishes for, since he's encouraging investors to ditch BTC for this new banker blockchain, which we have no clue yet to what protections if any it offers, other than granting full control to them and governments, since cash would be out of the equation.

Bear in mind the NSA's tools which were leaked to the 'Net. With them, one can hack into another's system and upload CP to it without the receiver's knowledge, yet that receiver now has CP and could be held liable if the originating party decided to turn in the receiving party to authorities. Yes, it's dirty and nasty for such a scenario to unfold, but the dog CAN eat your homework when it comes to computers!
With Bitcoin, there's a ying/yang aspect to consider. Yes, this information on the Blockchain MUST remain to keep the chain intact going forward. It goes back to how Bitcoin is secured in the first place via the Merkle Tree. It also proves the extremes that a hateful or fear-driven critic will go to crush this absolute game-changer. I have news for this person or group: GET OVER IT! Even if Bitcoin dies on the vine, it let the Genie out of the bottle and he ain't goin' back in there. Other solutions have emerged where such an attack vector under the color of law shall have NO effect. The B0rG will eventually assimilate you and your criminal banker buddies who try to remain relevant, much like those in Citibank placing restrictions on Second Amendment protection purchases.

Seriously doubtful, however, if SHA256 should be cracked where reverse hashes can be resolved to a private key, then all Bitcoin will become utterly worthless. Of course there are more complex hashing with some coins, so there's strong hope going forward.

Here's what I continue seeing; Even with so many issues facing Bitcoin both in the past and today, it still got past the Jamie Dimon's of the world. Many still predict a retest of 6k USD although that hasn't happened. The core release should help on transaction fees. There may well be a Black Swan landing somewhere which helps boost the coin. So many possibilities. You're right that time and the market will tell.

If you've ever HODLed Doge, the same thing was said then. Today, a Doge is worth far more than it was just months ago. A former roomie put in around $150 into it and presently sits on $2,000+ (His Dogecoin holding was above 7,500 maybe a month ago?) if he can ever remember the password he used. Bitcoin WILL recover and so will the alts. Because the alts are still too sympathetic to Bitcoin's swings (some due to regulatory concerns which may never pan out!) it indicates that we're nowhere near maturity in crypto. It's still very young and WILD!

There was once a webwallet service which I transmitted some BTC to an address that I no longer had an account with because they had gone out of biz and didn't have the Private Keys any longer.

It did in my case. Let me explain... 
The first huge datablock which contains like the first year or two zips by very quickly and apparently did not have to draw from other peers. From about 5 years ago and forward, it has gone to a snail's pace and continues progressing at a few weeks worth in a 12 hour period. I'm down to 1 year 40 weeks and still a few weeks worth of data in 12 hours I am away from this computer. Note too, there are numerous peers connected to me. Port 8333 is open and I see others connected to it, although BitNodes doesn't show a connection when I invoke it to try. It never did this nonsense on Win7 for that matter. Nevertheless, I will try out Ubuntu on another box I'm not using and will see how this compares.

I have a better idea. If the bankers or their hired minions are doing this, why not at least consider defacing currency with URL's to obscene sites? The bankers are already doing much harm to the public and fiat is used all the time in illegal transactions with none of them going to jail. Oh, I'll hear plenty of how "it's illegal to do that!" but Bitcoin seems exempt because there's no CENTRALIZED party to target.

The single mom needs to wrap her head around the Bottom Line. She should be prepping up on both fuel and food, water is critical, and some fiat hidden away OUTSIDE the bank$ would be extremely helpful when the rest of her town/community/city is lined up around the block trying to get ca$h out because the credit cards don't work any longer. Think I'm kidding? Considering the credit lockups in some areas during the recent solar eclipse (I was in Wyoming to experience that last month) and almost impossible to get on the internet right after the event, one must ask themselves just how easy any digital currency, including any supposedly "compliant" ones the bank$ters dream up, will be to access.

Even though I hated your comment, you are CORRECT! If I teach a cryptocurrency course (which I'm still putting together, BTW) I will give the greatest emphasis on security of one's crypto with as much information as I can dish out in that regard.

Make it NINE! I believe CE "gets" it. To my present understanding, the data relates to specific links or URL's on the internet.
The evidence a court obtains cannot be accessed by anyone as long as a court-ordered concealment remains in place. Otherwise, the public could well request this information and so could the media. (I worked in the media decades ago.) Furthermore, how much data can a Blockchain in Bitcoin take? Not much for an image readily usable or tradeable for that matter, especially when much of the space is meant for transactions. I certainly don't see where I can readily attach an image to a Bitcoin transaction with any wallet I've encountered. To me, this appears way too FUDdy on the surface so the media I once worked for has to apparently return a few banker and elitist favors. This only proves my decision to ditch those buffoons over a decade back was the RIGHT one!

But, when a police officer shoots an unarmed person or suspect, either directly or indirectly, they always claim "Officer Safety" at the top of their toolkit with their police union and usually the PA/DA/CA and/or Grand Jury justifying their trigger happiness. Disturbing pattern, but at least there's more body cams catching this. What? You mean more states are protecting the body cams' contents??
Bitcoin and other cryptos in cold storage can at least ensure a transfer of value to an better-informed or appropriate attorney or group of them when a government has frozen a suspect's entire bank balance. Don't discount this so quickly!

That depends if the seller is "connected." After all, Bill Clinton said during his Monica fiasco to paraphrase "It depends on what 'is' IS." Essentially splitting legal hairs. 
Why even have a law which specifies a limit, yet stings people operating just outside it, instead of simply making it illegal overall in the first place? That's simply too much and would cause 1) the overall economy to crash (when taking into account of drug money laundering as HSBC, BofA, et al, has done with nothing more than a slap on the wrists and monetary fines) and 2) Doing so delays any real discussion on the root causes of these "problems" in the first place.

So what's the Magic Solution you offer? I'm giving at least three as part of this missive. As I mentioned earlier, if not in this specific thread, but elsewhere in Reddit - The material MUST, I repeat, MUST remain intact due to how the Blockchain is secured via Merkle Tree or hash tree from the point forward where these infractions happened.
This, or 1) The Blockchain must be halted while the offensive material is removed, thus freezing BTC for an unknown period of time, then all miners and users must reindex everything from the block where the offence occurred. This can restore the validity and maintain the integrity at significant cost to all Bitcoin parties. Something Bitcoin h8trs will enjoy! 2) Have nations introduce legislation which offers at least limited protection(s) to cryptocurrency blockchains and similar in regard to such material having been posted by a user. This could include a requirement that additional technologies which can limit future damage (such as encryption to most end users) be implemented as condition of said protection, as they are developed. Provided that continued transparency of information contained remain accessible, I would have no objections, or finally 3) SCREW THIS! Let's just throw in the towel and declare Bitcoin as dead as a ball-peen hammer, because we can't entertain the possibility of anyone with a functional cranium using any portion of this technology to yield additional smut to the world. Bitcoin h8trs and the bankers in particular will declare "Mission Accomplished" while their criminality of manipulation as part of the Big Picture continues unabated. Nevermind, such things are happening with impunity in regard to the endless memes of the Internet and cellphones to share objectionable sex materials, yet I hear no outcry from the general public to do anything significant about it, other than fine or suspend driving privileges of offenders whom text endlessly behind the wheel.

I strongly disagree with point  People need to be taught about Private and Public keys being part of this, especially the former! Those in here understand why.

 With that said, I'm pleased that people are striving to make Bitcoin easier for Granny to understand and use! It need not be something relegated for the techy bunch, yet due to how it functions, one's security of their balances is paramount.

Interesting article, although the author may well be late to the party.. When the BIS claims the USD is supreme, they're ignoring the latest news regarding China and Russia who trade amongst themselves, not requiring SWIFT. In fact, I sincerely pray America does something so stupid as exclude our top creditor from SWIFT as was mentioned in ZeroHedge days ago. You'll see the Dollar's Demi$e happen so quickly! The bad part of it is that War will likely be the immediate result, to take away attention from the collective Sheeple. Bitcoin could well be a safe haven.
We're being told that the "debt" is conveniently swept under the rug per cancellation? If that's the case, then maybe we don't owe any more taxes as Unicornville has finally arrived with a Universal Income and other wild, unsustainable poppycock.

Continue hodling whatever BTC you possess, especially the dust as
SegWit should be your saving grace! Consider though, that small amount people today considers as "dust" may well become huge if the demand for BTC continues to skyrocket as the Market will sort it out one way or the other. It's a shame when people discard their dust as those dust bunnies do add up. The question then becomes "Will Bitcoin users and miners be able to sort it out without ruining it collectively?" and I have faith enough that BIP148 will be agreed on and save us a hard fork. If it doesn't, then altcoins competing will gain more traction. At this point in time, I don't even consider the alts except for payment through a third-party service once my portal launches.

If you're asking what nations, I won't name them all as these are cards I hold close to my chest, yet I'll give y'all a peek at some. So far, each have their pros and cons. Almost half are in Asia and each are English-language friendly enough. Latin America has three I'd consider for my 2nd passport and I know are crypto friendly. Two in Europe would be considered, then the Caribbean gets the rest. Now, if I stay American, I have but two choices; to stay: Puerto Rico gives the best promises. Stateside, I love Wyoming for too many reasons and am actively looking into a move there, including a replacement job so I don't spend up my crypto which the state protects now. Trying to reach their Blockchain Coalition is like pulling on that loose baby tooth in anticipation of the Tooth Fairy!

Errr... More like 100 of 'em! It's sad there are no more Big Bills here. An even better reason to appreciate Bitcoin. :)

This isn't new.. If you've kept up with the Keiser Report, there were 3 guys in discussions with the Gov't regarding such tracking technology months, maybe a year ago. It can be defeated, IOW the trail can be broken if you know how to do it.
This is additional reason that the People need to stand up and get rid of Civil Asset Forfeiture once and for all! It is technology which attempts in making each of us part of the Borg. To that end, I disagree with Technom4ge in regard to giving any significant level of trust to the government. Too many of them are unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, interested in impressing Congress. Congressmen need to hear from the People on such technologies, so nonsense laws aren't conveniently snuck in during Christmas Eve (The Fed comes to mind!)
Finally, who is leading the company? The former head of the USELESS CFTC! There's NEVER any silver price manipulation, despite a multi-year investigation by that group of buffoons. Already, any trust factor to grant it has seriously deflated with just that knowledge in my book at least.

In reality, using mosquito netting is far more effective to prevent malaria than the so-called "vaccine" that Bill Gates wants to give.

I tend to agree for one reason. Looking at the 6-month chart, that's long enough to see a cup being formed (it began before mid-February) and the other end of the cup is on the upswing. Now to play Devil's Advocate - where will the inevitable breakout with the handle go? Up or Down??

Such reward. Much W0W. Give Bitcoin their just-due and they'll certainly join in.

I spent time &amp; $$ researching these. I gave some of it out. Let the NSA and their Deseret data center  figure out the rest. As is, they got the goods on Hillary, so I want them to do some good for once.

I was watching the stream (still off of work) and almost crapped my pajamas. Unexpected fleeting bliss! Some flat-out missed it due to the red graphic, which is obvious she would be opposed to any transparency. They don't want the 99.99% to peek under the veil. That alone is a reason I HODL proudly!

Even worse, either the ESF or PPT are throwing so much paper gold and silver into COMEX to put lipstick and mascara on that USD pig. Why is an ounce of silver in USD @ 16 and a half? Why??

Really? As they say in Mexico; Porque?
Do you assume that Bitcoin users are only those who grew up with the technology? I thought there was a push to get this technology accepted by more and more people, some with limited technical savvy. To this day, the magical app which is simple enough for granny to understand crypto hasn't appeared. Until then, can't this sub be of help in warning Bitcoin users who aren't as far along as most here, of scummy phishers? As an example, I've been a part of Phishtank since its second month of existence and have helped shut down many a phisher's nonsense. 
Yes, mail filters are good, yet they're not always effective. Some phish emails spoof the URL header. Maybe you have the perfect filter or service to share with the class? I see nothing wrong with this sub warning users of scams. Bitcoin is $$, security of it is paramount, and I believe warnings are warranted here.

Consider if someone drives into Green Bank (WV, near the big dish) and sets up a 2.4 GHZ wi-fi router, they get sniffed out and warned to shut it down. Both the state and FCC have enforcement and fines available in that area. It took nearly an act of God to have snowshoe resort finally capable of allowing wi-fi to visitors. Visit Green Bank and you can find payphones that still work, since cell phone service isn't allowed.  Ham radio operators  (as myself) are the quickest means to communicate, other than the wireline phones. Just one radio station has clearance to broadcast locally. Even with digital filtering (which does have merit) I doubt the NRQZ is ready for this project, at least without significant advance coordination.

"If you get scammed out of 10 bitcoins, you're fucked. You literally have no recourse."
   Why is that really so bad? When the IRS pays a taxpayer whose ID and refund was stolen by some Indian criminal gang (they're getting caught, BTW) That money is now inflated! With Bitcoin, those hodlers not involved didn't suffer any effects.
 
 "more scams are coming -- older, less known tricks that will flourish in this naive fledgling game."
On this point, I totally, totally agree! Remember those early days of Bitcoin 1.0, the desktop software? I was part of that. Yep, the requested miner fee on that wallet was .01 BTC, but consider that Bitcoin was worth pennies on the dollar during Winter 2009 when I was mining with my desktop. It also had no freakin' security, so it was easy for malware to be distributed to steal wallet.dat files, simply having them FTP'ed to a crook for prompt processing. Who'd have thought? Consider too the Bitomats of the Internet (2011) were extremely painful, losing coins due to sheer stupidity. With that said, if something doesn't pass the smell test, don't pluck that "rose" only to find out it's a midget cousin to the corpse bloom.
"at some point, society thought it was worth it to sacrifice some of their fiscal anonymity &amp; freedom if it protected their investments."
Society drank the bank$ter's Kool-Aid! Government is already in bed with these fools. Both are losing The Game, yet they won't go down without dragging the rest of us with them, if it truly comes down to it. If the Sheeple weren't already so dependent on government and got angry enough to not only refuse such dependency, but rebelled strongly enough to scare these so-called representatives enough to question their own relevancy going forward, then some changes would quickly take place. I realize though, that's asking too much and that a Grand Reset has a 99x better chance of happening. That's how I read these tea leaves, today.

Let's consider an edit: Your coins are safe either
1) In a wallet which you literally have access to the Private Key information, such as a device you control, in other words, not an online wallet where a third-party must keep the Private Key! OR
2) Legibly written or coded on a sheet of paper and securely stored, best known as Cold Storage.
It is fully agreed that an exchange is never safe to consider as a bank for one's coins! The less time you keep them in such, the less chance you'll be Gox'ed, Cryptsy'ed, or Bitomat'ed.

Even Predictious in Ireland has their $3000 USD for a Bitcoin bets going for 9.9mBTC per contract to win 10mBTC. Confidence is strong, and why not? :)

I agree solely for the reason ETH is the fuel for the Ethereum Blockchain. There's a definite good use for it. What goes against it is the lack of scarcity going forward. I see a bubble, but to say when demand is finally balanced is a tough call.

Do as I do and keep a copy of that wallet. Give it time. Who'd thought that $30 - $50 BTC being worth closing in on 3k today?

However, that could change with Lightning Network, and/or how Bitcoin gains more ground. That dust will gain more shine, so hang onto it!

What about his 100 million Oz plus silver stash he had, maybe a decade or so, ago? Yes, he unloaded it and it seemed much like "convenient " terms at that, if you get what I mean.

One word used was "domestic " when Bitcoin is a nicely - international store of value that can spend in more of the world. An international airport would be an even better test. Just don't travel with any BTC swag, lest the TSA alerts in-house law enforcement, sometimes fed agents with questions. Can't give too much competition as Uncle hates that.

Even if you're correct, it'll still be a nightmare for the National Radio Quiet Zone which affects portions of West Virginia,  Virginia and a tiny part of Maryland. I'm wondering how the radio telescopes in Pocahontas County will mitigate this RF soup??
