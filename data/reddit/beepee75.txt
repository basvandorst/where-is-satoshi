I agree and once it's there, BTC will strike back massively. But it has to stop forking and start evolving now. The last 6 months have been ridiculous for its image. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:09:05
I think there will actually be at least 10-25 very great projects in different areas that are able to generate value in real life. Transaction is one of the more important ones. Logistic, platform dApp, storage, ID, administration processes, energy...all these will not necessarily compete with each other. Some ecosystems (ETH, NEO, VeChain...) will be the very big drivers but there will always be a place for good ideas in specialized areas.

Bitcoin behaves like a lazy old crypto dictator. Sooner or later, either it evolves or it will fall.

He will be much disappointed - he's a good friend of mine and can totally be trusted. He sent me 34mio $ last week (had to send him 12'000$ for fees before but no problem)

You can send some BTC to my private portfolio and I will give you more insider information :-D

For all people saying "I'm too late":
We're still in a state of "Internet around 1998" or so. Imagine investing 5'000 $ in some of the bigger companies at the time. 90% gone or useless and we had the bubble, sure.  but you needed only 10% of your money invested in amazon, yahoo, google, apple or microsoft and it would have turned out pretty well,
Would you like to travel back in time and invest some money? Yes, obviously.  Well now is your chance to invest in a market that will explode in the next 10 years and it's still only the beginning.

I made a coin for that: Tattoocoin (TTC)
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:30:17
Actually, "bite" means "penis" and "coin" is a "corner" (BTC could be pronounced beet-quang) and sounds very funny but slightly abusing

WHAT In THE WORLD IS GOING ON?!
This is just crazy I can see my money growing every couple of minutes right now. Did the federal reserve sell their gold to buy BTC?

If BTC hits 26'000 by the eoy, I will get a tattoo with the wizard eating John McAfees dick :-)

Of you lost your mind?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:26:53
I agree but the difference here: many users will just use random reddit discussions to invest here and there. The classic investments are less volatile because the average investor is much more aware of  what he's actually doing. And you have more people investing AND more info sources that you would have to manipulate. So manipulating gold or oil prices are nearly impossible unless you're a government or cartell. In crypto, you just need a small team on the right platform to manipulate currencies.
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:58:30
I mean: we are probably right to invest in Crypto but there IS a chance that we will look back on our lives one day and have the same perception. Let's not forget about the internet bubble 16 years ago. History will probably repeat - please accept a potential loss (or 80% loss) of your investments as a real possibility. That said, I still invest a lot here but I try not to go "all in".
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:42:06
Thank you! This.
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:57:12
Serious? Like in every country in the world at the same time? And what would be the legal base for Bitcoin to be declared illegal in the first place? I don't see any risk here
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:21:22
It's hard to tell because I can't speak for everyone. I think that you will sometimes hear a lot of good or bad news about some coins/currencies and a lot of comments on these post reinforcing the message. I like Ark i.e. but the moment it started increasing in value seems completely random. It will go down soon (to be back later because it's a good project). Here, in the short run Ark is being manipulated to make everyone jump on the FOMO train.
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:42:50
Yes and no. I know what you mean but once a bubble pops, every asset will suffer in the beginning. After a while, the "good" projects will recover (soon probably). But I agree that the shit coins and ICOs (and greedy investors) will probably cause most of the Mayhem.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:38:49
Long run strategy anyone? 
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:26:18
I don't agree. The internet bubble was people investing in a new hype, regardless of realistic economic potentials. Amazon,Ebay and Google were among some really great assets but there were also a lot of BS companies or companies that - though surviving the bubble - have been put away by better concepts a few years later (Yahoo). 
The same will happen to Crypto. We don't know yet which concepts will survive or dominate in 10-15 years. We can make some assumptions that i.e. BTC could be like Amazon or Ethereum like Google. 
But it could well be that Ethereum or NEO are more of a Yahoo or something like the Netscape Navigator or Altavista: successfull in the beginning but dead in 5 years.
Time will tell. 95% of what we see today will be gone in 10 years and there will be a lot of new concepts that we can't even imagine today (like Facebook, Spotify, Snapchat).

This post makes no sense. We are the people. We are also greedy. As long as we have big players that can manipulate the market, nothing changes.
@_date: 2017-09-26 18:37:20
OK guys so just for the people waiting BTC to rule the world. This is not going to happen as long this kind of tech insider bullshit (TIB) is a main topic. How do you expect mass adoptation from normal people with this kind of discussion that 99.9% of the population don't understand. It's great to have the geeks (otherwise we wouldn't see crspto at all) but this crap will have to stop sooner or later. It's just not helping to build trust.
@_date: 2018-11-18 07:57:22
This must be the most uninformed and stupid post today. The guy just took the old ECR-20 token when VeChain swapped to their own mainnet 4 months ago. You bet there‘s no users LMAO

I see it "the other way round" TBH: The prices of all coins together is the market cap. When money leaves the market, the average price of every single coin will have to go down. Because the market cap is in USD (real money), that's the total money that all the coins can share to define their value. When money is pumped in the market, all the coins will go up (in average).
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:59:04
Thx!! Great
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:41:15
Oh, I think that when market capitalization can move up and down by 20% in a few days, you'd better try to find a pattern. Because this will be the major impact on your coins in this period. So IF (!!) i.e. the whole market always crashes on a friday or by the end of the month (or quarter), then I would take all my money out a day before and reinvest once the dip has reached its 10-15% (let's figure transactions costs). But I guess that there's no clear pattern? ;-)
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:34:45
As long as total cap grows in the long run (let's assume a 10% growth each year to be on the safe side), your average coin will - ceteris paribus - grow 10% in value as well. So total cap is one of THE MF most important numbers ever because if total cap was only 1'000'000 $ and will never grow, guess what will happen to that BTC price? :-)
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:51:45
No I'm confused by the total market moving 20% up and down in such a short period of time. This is basically "real money" converting in crypto and back (which is quite expensive). So seeing large amounts go out ("It's the ETH bubble!") and then see the money come back ( and ETH up by 25%), the reason behind this is unclear to me. It's not something "that just happens".

@_date: 2017-06-28 21:43:28
If it's normal, I just have to figure out the pattern (if there's one) and I'll be rich in a couple of months. :-)
