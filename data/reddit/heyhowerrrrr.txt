Some nice volatility you got there, shame if someone capitalized it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:28:32
Its a trap.

Pause, everyone pause, time out.  GDAX needs a minute to prepare a proper fucking.   They'll let us know when they're ready to resume.

I'm writing the word Tether in this thread, simply because it has seemingly not shown up yet.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:29:05

I don't understand why people are pissed at bitfinex'd for pointing out the obvious weirdness surrounding tether.
Why shoot the messenger? Why go through the trouble of bot-reporting him.  He'll be back, now with more power.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:18:42
you want to hodl the hodlers.  This is like dividing by zero. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:44:08
