Consumerism can die. Investment and savings grow the economy, debt based spending shrinks it.

It's supposed to be expensive and cost significant resources. If it was cheap, it would be easy to attack and worthless.
Distributed consensus is hard, bitcoin solves that with proof of work. If you want a cheap solution put your faith in the federal reserve and hope they don't inflate your currency and undo your transactions.

I'd to see how much of a "great developer team" these alt coins have after they shoot up in price and thr devs become millionaires and get tired in infighting.

M3 money supply is $75 trillion. $2 trillion is not much.

During the high fee period a few months ago, a single transaction fee cost as much as running a node for a month.
Also lighting doesn't fix this, unless you want everyone to get only one on chain transaction every 10 years.

0.5 BTC reward forever? Or still decreasing to zero? Are you suggesting making bitcoin an inflationary asset?

If t-bills earn 1% (or even negative rates as they have recently) while inflation is 4% a year, you aren't escaping inflation.

Buy you can make copies of your bitcoin keys. You can't copy your gold savings.

Not worthless, but not worth as much as those assets are now. In certain real estate markets it's very clear that prices are being driven up by speculative demand (trying to escape fiat inflation). If a global bitcoin hard money existed (instead of fiat), some of that speculation value world go into the bitcoin market cap.

Correct. Bitcoin supporters are way too submissive of point of sale technologies. Bitcoin is a currency, and Apple Pay, Visa, etc can fully integrate it. These third parties offer valuable services that bitcoin cannot offer

Correct. Bitcoin price and miner profits make the hash rate higher, not asic efficiency.

I agree. DCA only makes sense if you have a stream of income to invest (like $100 of your paycheck every month). If you have a lump sum and are ready to invest DCA doesn't make sense -- without any other data, you don't if the price is going up or down in the future, so you might as well buy now.
No one thinks of the guy who was ready to drop a bunch into bitcoin at $1,000, but instead DCA his purchases for months at the price climbed to $19,000.

And what if it keeps going up and you missed the train. My advice: buy what you can now and hodl.

Or just buy some miners are keep mining on the original BTC chain. Even if 99% of miners jump to BTC2x, the BTC chain is still there and all your BTC coins are spendable with your private keys. It just might take a while for blocks to be found and difficulty to adjust.
This "stealing" stuff is a hyperbole.
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:31:30
Still not clear. Are they trying to trick you into converting your BTC into BTC2x so they can profit wheb BTC2x crashes in price?

Also the groomsmen only have one copy... so moving this to a new (HD, password encrypted wallet) with redundant backups is highly recommended.

There's not much to compress, it's mostly random hashes with few repeated strings. It's like trying to zip a jpeg our mpeg file.
