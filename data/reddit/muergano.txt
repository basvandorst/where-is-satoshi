It is hard to do so because crowdfunding pages don't provide their services to Venezuela. All venezuelans need to ask to a friend or a relative who already left the country to put a crowdfunding campaing, and I don't have anyone outside Venezuela.

Fees are above $5 dude. You sent barely pennies.
Besides, $700 worth of BTC, which is what you get, buys more than 200 nutritious meals, unless you are buying luxury food, clothes and buying expensive brands of personal supplies like Axe, you are overpaying for everything.
1 meal in here costs less than $1.

The problem is that I need a bank account in other country. It isn't because my IP.

I have been getting troubles to get the help I was needing for my family while I emigrate to Colombia, as [I explained in the previous thread](
OP already sent me $10 worth of BTC but it is almost impossible to do something with it because of fees.
I hope people consider this before working with @_date: 2018-01-26 17:33:54

This is similar to my situation, except I'm the one living in Venezuela.  I can't even afford to pay transport to go to the public university, barely is enough to pay for transport to go to work where is the only place I can get food, which leaves me as a privileged individual compared to the rest of my family who are already suffering the effects of starvation to whom I share with the meals I get at work. Even in my position I feel bad for those who don't have a job or those who do have a job but can't afford bus tickets to go to work, their children, newborns, elder people, are the most threatened.
As for me, I can totally relate what cryptocurrencies can do for those in precarious conditions as mine and your family: weeks ago I got some US dollars worth of a cryptocurrency, and I'm currently trying to make savings with my $4/monthly salary (every penny counts) to emigrate to other country, which would be impossible to do with VEF because of hyperinflationary monetary policies applied by the government. I can tell many others as I are doing the same with crypto currencies with plans to leave this country.
