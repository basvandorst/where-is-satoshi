It's good to die for Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:19:46
Yes food for thought
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:41:57
Tnt, boom
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:24:56
No none
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:46:20
My Jupiter did well, I was batch 1
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:49:49
Looks very shady
@_date: 2014-06-27 06:35:38
Never trust a company for more than one thing, they frequently deprecate features, get a conflict of interest or just stop caring about certain features
@_date: 2014-06-28 07:49:17
Yeah right
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:58:03
It's a joke
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:29:05
Wow he called us trendy
@_date: 2014-06-27 07:20:42
I'm sick of fairlay shill posts
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:25:36
He's letting idiots think Litecoin will succeed
Litecoin is a joke
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:54:59
Fuck Apple
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:57:15
Watch Taken
@_date: 2014-06-29 05:17:19
Litecoin is a joke, they're just desperate
@_date: 2014-06-20 10:16:39
Ugh dump all the alts already 
@_date: 2014-06-24 19:24:52
I'm making litecon
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:49:26
Backpage is good
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:04:59
Over 80%
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:19:33
Yes these trolls don't care it's already solved
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:49:49
They sell phone cards and shit I believe
@_date: 2014-06-24 08:07:59
I'm confident ghash will disappear, they're simply scamming idiots with cloud hashing
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:29:51
Charts and shit
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:50:56
Oh I was watching vice and the Ukrainian nuclear testing, they were all Asians so I got distracted
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:46:17
Well I'll remember never to donate
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:46:04
Yeah it's really shady
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:21:51
Call bitpay
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:17:40
Who do you work for shill
@_date: 2014-06-21 14:06:18
They're cringe worthy
In a great accomplishment they alienated both Bitcoin supporters and detractors
@_date: 2014-06-24 22:21:06
I think they said exchanges were not like kind, it's very strict
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:50:11
Well even with tor, one person owns the site and can add all the reviews he wants
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:55:44
There's no reason not to do it, it won't even increase the blockchain. There's only the incentive of might as well include transactions not random data
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:10:54
Yeah but satoshi never imagined pooled mining which is very different, he hadn't invented a way to not have workers steal blocks they find, slush did that much later
Mining farms are not pools
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:06:55
Yeah you're right it doesn't need to change, it just needs to eat bandwidth
@_date: 2014-06-24 15:47:58
With a lower price
@_date: 2014-06-24 09:37:15
Looks like he wants to scare the banks away to get Coinbase into power
@_date: 2014-06-28 07:46:06
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:09:07
I don't see it
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:05:25
Get out
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:41:15
Do the right thing and just do it, you'll get shit tons tips laters
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:19:57
What's up with all of them coming from third party developers
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:37:43
No because it gets subtracted from the profit margin which means the fee is actually much higher
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:07:12
@_date: 2014-06-21 16:54:24
@_date: 2014-06-21 15:20:14
Another scam coin like Litecoin, ignore them all
@_date: 2014-06-28 20:01:36
I lie constantly real feelings come after
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:27:55
To you no, to the 10 Mexicans doing your dirty work, yes.
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:01:40
You toss it when storing but check it when relaying
@_date: 2014-06-28 06:41:47
Lol april 
@_date: 2014-06-29 07:29:45
What's a club
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:46:06
Litecoin is a scam
@_date: 2014-06-25 13:10:46
I think we should host Bitcoin parties Tupperware
@_date: 2014-06-30 08:46:29
Gotta be classy
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:22:24
He looks like diarrhea
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:00:16
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:51:22
Vacationing before his death
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:23:47
Yeah that's good
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:40:30
Lol Litecoin is a joke
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:42:53
It's yelp for prostitutes
@_date: 2014-06-29 05:03:40
Yeah I swore when I clicked the link Bitcoin wouldn't be mentioned at all
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:02:39
Goxed means stolen like mt Gox
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:59:19
Fiat is monkey money
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:40:44
No wonder he's single
@_date: 2014-06-27 07:42:07
You can see the price increasing depending on the number of coins you're buying
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:24:43
I can't wait for gb blocks
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:13:44

@_date: 2014-06-23 05:01:13
Isis is a joke
Wont even run on my rooted phone
Idiots had a chance with Google wallet but killed it
Greedy Bastards ruined nfc 
Google wallet is still banned on my note 3 and isis refuses to run, I'm so over paying by tapping
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:11:08
I hear Mark is good friends
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:11:04
Guess he's trying to get his money back
@_date: 2014-06-22 02:50:27
They already alienated me
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:45:07
I've sold all my fiat already
@_date: 2014-06-23 07:55:28
Very nice
@_date: 2014-06-30 04:50:30
@_date: 2014-06-30 08:27:52

Op is a liar
@_date: 2014-06-25 13:35:11
The classic lp2844
But newer cheaper models like the brother would be amazing
I got a Samsung laser, hp inkjet, lp2844 and I'll buy some new ones if you'd like me to beta test
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:57:01
Good, too many child prostitutes. Guess they watched Taken
@_date: 2014-06-19 11:20:28
What happened to macro mode
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:46:12
No I took my money and they took a week to send Bitcoin because he was too busy
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:22:40
Lol they're still up
Let's do the right thing and click their ads to drain their budgets
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:38:36
That's true but they can still get caught
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:54:37
Let's do it, ghash see what happens? 
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:00:52
Because blocks are validated by nodes before storing and relaying, you enforce it by making sure gzip can't go below say 99%. Doesn't have to be random just uncompressable.
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:42:32
General public did get scared of stupid ghash 
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:11:26
No he's lying
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:12:35
@_date: 2014-07-01 01:32:27
Fuck you
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:50:29
Whatever you do, stay far away from the foundation
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:17:57
Cash grab by pierce

@_date: 2014-06-30 04:52:25
ALL these companies launch great and the first product is amazing, then they Fuck you. I got the first great from bfl, black arrow, knc. All amazing products.
Then got fucked by knc and bfl royally
I luckily avoided black arrow by a small margin because I ran out of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:27:57
Don't give him your email! 
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:44:35
Be nice, this will give him a seizure
@_date: 2014-06-29 21:19:03
Lol these fools keep forgetting about the universal part
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:42:21
Yes but the problem is one guy owns your hashing until you can pull out
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:40:36
Be nice, that's green, he's color blind
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:03:37
I use armory offline
@_date: 2014-06-28 07:41:24
Hope he burns in hell
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:03:33
Bitpay is the only choice right now
@_date: 2014-06-25 13:39:53
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:16:25
Lol they already took your money why would they reply? They're probably owned by ghash
Why would you even pay them while they're on ghash? 
They didn't promise anything, they just shilled on the ghash news to pump their stock
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:46:06
No a killer feature is to auth to the atm through your already kyc exchange account
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:49:05
True I'll personally avoid them though
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:07:23
Let's pump this up, go neo bee
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:48:42
@_date: 2014-06-24 09:02:51
Scumbag ghash
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:53:36
Never ever trust anyone that lays out their "credentials"
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:52:36
It's good to die for Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:47:32
What if I told you, you won't need to sell when the time is right
@_date: 2014-06-21 13:10:41
I.really like these cubes but very expensive
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:13:10
Cool name
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:00:18
So they weren't reliable, shipping was supposed to be March
I'm also screwed
@_date: 2014-06-28 07:42:29
Coinbase is full of criminals
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:01:41
He's a faggot
@_date: 2014-06-20 17:25:08
Sorry I had to burn the last neo bee issue
@_date: 2014-06-22 05:43:01
Tpm and sim
@_date: 2014-06-18 11:44:06
Hundreds of times cheaper
@_date: 2014-06-22 10:42:20
@_date: 2014-06-23 03:57:04
Does it work or is it just for weed
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:23:44
Yes they're criminals
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:54:42
Capitalism is banned, they're socialist
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:44:19
Selfish mining is good, let's punish ghash
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:24:13
Coinbase sucks, use bitpay
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:11:56
Slit Danny's throat
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:38:06
Upvote competing post, but I don't see one

You're a criminal
@_date: 2014-06-28 05:07:09
Lol stupid Litecoin
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:50:46
The Amazon button doesn't even work lol
@_date: 2014-06-27 07:21:57
@_date: 2014-06-21 08:28:08
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:58:36
You think old pervs looking for child prostitutes know how to use tor? And those that do will leave evidence everywhere.
Secondly, it'll be a honey pot
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:50:29
Stripe is a joke
Go bitpay, don't support these bank criminals
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:22:08
Was last halving early? 
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:17:59
Probably the same account the Nigerian uses to scam guys on Craigslist
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:42:36
It's only illegal when Bobby blows his load on prostitutes and rice
Sick of this guy and his stupid Litecoin brother
They're a drain
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:22:29
Why the Fuck does it link to Google drive
Proof 
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:35:31
Lol he sounds like a faggot
@_date: 2014-06-23 08:07:18
He's shorting
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:19:05
Never trust a company for more than one purpose
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:43:04
True but he didn't discover it yet, the guy inventing crt never imagined lcd
@_date: 2014-06-30 06:49:58
@_date: 2014-06-24 08:02:17
Fucking assholes
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:02:22
A company Circle keeps "launching" but no one can use it, it means delayed for who knows when
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:56:24
If it plays to your greed. It's a scam
Changetip is one click away, the only reason youd pm is because your greed is taking over
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:55:12
90% according to fbi
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:22:18
Idiot using ios
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:09:04
It's probably the easiest wallet I've used
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:48:41
They disabled my account for providing tech support services! Wtf
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:57:44
So tomorrow lol
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:49:15
That's why I'm switching to debian 
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:56:10
It's good to die for Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:12:00
Yup but depositing might be unsafe since you'll bring the private key to a computer to get the address
@_date: 2014-06-25 14:09:17
Oh wow didn't realize it was a male plug, that's very limited, I wonder if you can hack a host mode female adapter
@_date: 2014-06-30 08:22:17
Difficulty has been insane
Yah it really depends if you go in with Bitcoin or fiat and what you exit to, also what Bitcoin is before and after. It gets complicated.
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:34:59
They're existing terminals
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:36:11
They have balls to add this shit
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:52:03
Yeah ok bitpay has no business model
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:27:37
Technically 1 miner can still run the entire network. Difficulty drops for him
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:16:20
Yes I'm starting to see your point if they are powerful
I guess we go back to my random data
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:23:43
Drown in diarrhea
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:19:11
You walk into Mexico idiot, don't drive
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:52:09
That's what happens when you sell to poor hipsters
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:19:46
I want to directly show them Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:24:38
Break off the sound and Bluetooth chips
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:18:25
Bitpay is a much better choice
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:35:24
Pools were a new invention by slush, it wasn't even thought of
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:37:13
It's funny they even "validate" display url
@_date: 2014-06-25 13:11:29
What is it
@_date: 2014-06-24 19:20:41
It's private, there's nothing to insure
Great for usb disks
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:41:30
Litecoin is a scam lol
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:45:42
Yes it will also steal your Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-21 14:22:51
Time to convert non believers
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:04:13
The best and they help you verify bip38 was done securely
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:15:16
I wonder if bfl will presell an arbitrage cam
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:24:36
You don't need blockchain just signatures
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:54:02
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:38:47
You'll get more by Just doing it then holding up a sign, losing will get you even more
@_date: 2014-07-03 08:33:35
2019 
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:13:44
Yeah but satoshi never imagined pooled mining which is very different, he hadn't invented a way to not have workers steal blocks they find, slush did that much later
Mining farms are not pools
@_date: 2014-06-29 05:54:53
Good this means they'll go out of business
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:55:37
Are you single Emily? 
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:15:55
They usually work but most sites highly recommend using a new address
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:41:39
They're a scam
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:51:04
not install
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:53:44
Soon my friend
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:59:52
Only use bitpay
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:28:45
But it's the third date, why'd I buy you dinners
@_date: 2014-06-29 05:53:55
It's called Namecoin
@_date: 2014-06-28 06:41:08
Why pay with card
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:16:20
Can you offer features like filing tax returns like with zenpayroll and paycycle
@_date: 2014-06-30 08:45:35
Sure why not
@_date: 2014-06-29 05:52:04
Spread the word, spread the secretaries ;)
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:21:16
No we have bits
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:43:37
Eli5 only so many transactions can fit in 1MB every 10 minutes
@_date: 2014-07-03 03:14:51
That's why you never trust Coinbase, they're wired into the gobt
Use armory
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:54:33
Yup where's the fucking competition
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:46:37
It's called criminal contempt of court
@_date: 2014-06-23 08:08:41
Part d is the most blatant fraud and tricked me into not refunding but I guess that wouldn't have helped anyway
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:24:02
He's a criminal
@_date: 2014-06-24 22:00:47
Idiots aren't pulling out now, you think they'd care if ghash started attacking? You give people too much credit
@_date: 2014-06-24 08:00:48
And those that do read scary shit
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:21:12
This is great news
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:41:26
General public did get scared of stupid ghash
@_date: 2014-06-20 10:58:02
Racist scum
@_date: 2014-06-30 03:37:18
Add fiverr
@_date: 2014-06-30 03:25:21
The community is nice yes but there's just no need and so much wasted effort and money

We present a formal model of synchronous processes without distinct identifiers (i.e., anonymous processes) that communicate using one-way public broadcasts. Our main contribution is a proof that the Bitcoin protocol achieves consensus in this model, except for a negligible probability, when Byzantine faults make up less than half the network. The protocol is scalable, since the running time and message complexity are all independent of the size of the network, instead depending only on the relative computing power of the faulty processes. We also introduce a requirement that the protocol must tolerate an arbitrary number of passive clients that receive broadcasts but can not send. This leads to a tight 2f + 1 resilience bound.

I say uncompressed so they cant cheat with tcp compression somewhere down the line, the point is to even the playing field
Compression algorithms are very mature and could be used to check very easily, just make sure gzip can't go below 99%
