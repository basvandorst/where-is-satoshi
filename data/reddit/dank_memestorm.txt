how is the lightning network not centralized?  lightning network is not bitcoin, so LN transactions are not censorship resistant.  only on-chain tx are censorship resistant

increase the blocksize. next question
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:54:46
so, I'll have to open a channel (and pay $5000 fee or whatever it will be in the coming months), then lock up my bitcoin for some length of time, buy my coffee, and then close the channel (another $5000 fee)
@_date: 2018-09-08 23:02:28
ouch.  I wish you the best of luck, perhaps if bitcoin reaches astronomical prices it will make sense to attempt the electron microscope business others have mentioned.
I also have a phone sitting around with lost bitcoin on it, but more like 0.01 not 80, lol.  dropped it in a pool and it doesn't boot anymore but maybe someday if the price is right

but they are still connected to the network. why not kick vulnerable nodes off instead of passively wait for them to upgrade?
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:27:58
lol, that only applies to real assets of value.  a fiat currency being hyperinflated to zero is only worth the heat value you can extract from the stacks of trillion bolivar paper rectangles in a wood-burning stove because that is its final use case (or as wallpaper or toilet paper)

that sounds like a ponzi scheme.  bitcoin is peer to peer electronic cash.

there are usability issues with some dex when compared to popular centralized exchanges.  the main problem though is a chicken-and-egg problem (they have no volume because they have no volume).  users go where the volume already is, and there are many Chinese exchanges popping up who are incentivizing 'wash' trading with trade-driven token mining, which attracts volume from competing exchanges including DEXs

@_date: 2018-10-09 16:10:46
So basically, use bitcoin as a *ponzi scheme* (albeit a better one as it's digital and permissionless) and "cash out" when the next greater fool buys in.  I don't see a problem with this line of thinking, especially not currently since 2nd layer solutions are vaporware smokescreen for the real prize of destroying bitcoin as a peer to peer electronic cash system.

its actually from [2011](  The FUD gets re-hashed every year or so, probably when a fresh batch of crypto noobs hear about it and it spreads around again.  Or when (somebody) wants to short bitcoin and a coordinated media fud cycle pushes it out again

yes fiat, this is a quote directly from Bitcoin Core developer luke-jr.   
they have forked Bitcoin from a peer-to-peer electronic cash system into.. I am not sure, they call it a 'store of value' but that isn't working out so well at the moment

@_date: 2018-03-28 17:17:03
this is what Core wants - don't use BTC as a means of exchange, it is meant to be purchased and put into cold storage or left on an exchange.  If you want to transact, just use fiat.

Something like that did happened in the early days of bitcoin, I think some block was created that gave like billions of BTC as the block reward

@_date: 2017-09-01 21:46:33
mBTC is 1/1000th of a bitcoin.  thus, multiply the hard cap of 21 million BTC by 1000 and you get a hard cap of 21 billion mBTC.  Divide the code of 1 BTC by 1000 and you get a cost of $4.80 per mBTC
its just a psychological trick to make bitcoin seem cheap and easily obtainable to the average consumer

1-2k will get you some GPUs you can use to mine altcoins and sell them for Bitcoin, or you can mine with Nicehash which pays you in bitcoin for your hashing power.
you'd need a bigger initial investment imo to get into the asic mining game, and the margins are razor thin and the competition incredible
in most cases you'd be better off directly purchasing crypto instead of mining.   although if I lived in say, Iceland and had free electricity, I would mine and use the heat produced from the miners to maximum efficiency :)

you can buy from many exchanges, or from someone locally, or an ATM.  Fees will vary, to get the best value you want to pay as little fee over the current market rate in exchange for whatever currency you are trading in.
it sounds like you are only into bitcoin as a speculative vehicle.  others are long-term holders or use it as a means of exchange in regular commerce
