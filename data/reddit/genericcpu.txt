It would be if the community wasn't hard headed.

I think ethereum is a great piece of tech, but the currency itself is worthless due to extremely poor excecution.

Thanks for your input, I have been thinking about it and I feel as if the value for LTC will not increase until it receives the momentum that Bitcoin has by the media. But who knows when that could happen tomorrow, although I still think bitcoin has more to rise before people switch over the another crypto-currency i believe that litecoin is theoretically more valuable. I couldn't find the post he was talking about in the video but check this out if you have time

For everyone asking me why I think litecoin is more secure here is my source

Ripple seems really sketchy to me, especially since the developers of ripple already own a large percentage of the ripples in exist.

My friend (with a "very sound algorithm")  lost 200BTC on that site so just count yourself lucky you didn't loose a fortune.
I know the feeling though, I have lost Bitcoins gambling before it isn't the best, and trying to win it back is dreadful. As a shareholder of Satoshi-Dice I am going to say, please give it another chance. Just kidding ;)

That was my first impression of litecoin, but in the end, I believe that the currency with the best math behind it will succeed.

namecoins, ahah what a joke

Interesting analogy, but as litecoin grows will it not eventually become more secure overall?
