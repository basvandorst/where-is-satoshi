Can you elaborate here please? I've been following this debate and have been a heavy supporter or Core and their roadmap, but was always under the impression since early 2016 that some sort of blocksize increase(no specific amount of bytes) was part of the scaling roadmap, particularly due to people saying that LN would need one.
I absolutely abhor all of the previous hard fork attempts and all the political bs that's been involved(and the people who pushed them). But I'm also a bit surprised that the 'good guys'(not being sarcastic here) seem to have gone a bit silent(at least on these public channels like reddit) since that stupid 2x shit got rightfully shut down.
If the new technical consensus is very explicitly that we have this handful of technologies that is truly going to eliminate the need for any near-mid term base blocksize increase, that's great. But the silence, or at least perceived silence, is a bit concerning. 
I'll just add that actually don't mind the argument that Bitcoin is already way too centralized and there's almost no trade off worth increasing that even further than it is, since it's arguably completely failed in the regard too. If that's the case, I can accept that too. But I'd like to hear it from the people know know best.

People made this exact argument back in the day with regards to volatility for 1k BTC, 10k BTC ect. 
Honestly, I don't think too many people expected this level of volatility at multi-hundred billion market cap levels. I thought it was reasonably plausible, but it hasn't been stable at all. I'm not saying the volatility is exactly the same, but it's still very volatile. It hasn't really worked out. Which is fine for a speculative asset I guess. I'm not really complaining. But I have zero expectations of volatility going away with Bitcoin always walking it's new, unknown path. 
I could have and did imagine most of the things you mentioned other than facebook, uber, and snapchat. And I wasn't special at all. I'd be surprised if anyone didn't think video chat, console online gaming, virtual assistants, large scale streaming online video wasn't an eventuality 20 years ago. Social media was a bit different, and Uber is unique. But I wouldn't be surprised if there were people predicting either of those things back then too.

Yes, there's so much invested in the status quo that there's always been a very strong anti-PoS force from day one. But there's also a good amount of legitimate criticism against some of the PoS systems that have been used so far. A good amount of people in Bitcoin and other areas believe that there's a fundamental flaw in the very concept of PoS and that it can never work no matter how clever the system is though.
Personally, I hope that there emerges some PoS system eventually that stands up to all the criticism. In theory it really would be way better than PoW if it's possible. It's going to be a lot of drama either way though for sure.

There was Bitpesa in parts of Africa, that might be what you're thinking of. But having a wallet and a way to send transactions was only a small part of the issue. You still had to find a way to convert the BTC to cash, and especially in converting amounts like $20-$300 you ended up paying big fees to the money changers, and probably still do today not even considering the network fees. It wasn't that good of a situation then really at all. The spread you pay on the cash to BTC part of the transaction doubled dipped with having to pay the much worse BTC to cash spread in very small markets was bad. If there's no liquidity, even if there's no network fees it's still not great. 
I only remember one company that created what appeared to be a decent situation for Filipino workers in Hong Kong sending home money by acting as the middleman. That was good I guess, but it was just a company that was is/was able to exist because it did a ton of work establishing the channel and then being able to avoid regulation for the time being. Good for them, I applaud their efforts, but that was the rare exception rather than the rule. If Bitcoin was super liquid worldwide with low spreads, it might be a different story. Maybe it actually is now, it was very illiquid worldwide back then with money changers charging big percentage points on the cash outs. Even now, a quick look at localbitcoins and it doesn't look great even now. But back then it was even worse. People knew this too, but the argument they'd make back then was that in the future you'd never have to cash out of BTC because you'd be able to buy everything with it. I don't quite think that's here yet for the non-western world, but maybe in the future.

I thought withdraws were free and they only charged for deposits?
That's what I thought I remember it saying when you send money there and pay them a pretty big fee(like higher than the network average fee, so you end up paying 2 times including the fee you use you send the tx which goes to miners of course).
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:26:38
in 2016 people were saying that LN would need bigger than 1MB anyway. Not sure if segwit's block weight is sufficient for that or not. Is it? Is what you're proposing something like 256kb base size blocks with like a much, much larger block weight?
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:31:40
All of them probably will eventually? There's no cost to forking to PoS if you think about it. Someone just does it and everyone now has coins on both chains. It's not like a mining hard fork where there are limited resources to fight over and one chain can literally die off from lack of miners. 
Now if you're asking about what community will actually support this new PoS chain, all I can say is probably not Bitcoin's.
If anything it's kind of amazing no one's really done it with BTC so far as far as I know. But that could just be because PoS technology is considered pretty bad still, if not completely impossible to achieve what people would consider a decentralized consensus. Even after being around since like 2012/2013 or so with PPCoin.

As someone who's been around forever, I think that might be overstating it a bit, because the buy-sell spreads were always particularly steep. Especially in countries where Localbitcoins was the only option, or some small local trader/shop. 
Like you could buy and sell BTC with a decentish spread if you were in the US or some parts of Europe. But that last mile converting it back to local currency in other countries made it not quite the slam dunk option that many people seemed to always believe that it was(or would become eventually).
If the fees were a non-issue then it might actually be better now than it was. I'm not sure how much better the spreads are now in 2018. I know there are all kinds of new exchanges and such, so it might be a much better situation now. If they are actually far better than they were, and super low fees via LN become a reality, then perhaps the rose-coloured past might become the real present though. 
If we're talking domestic transfers, they are almost always super low cost or free in every 'developing' or 'newly developed' country from what I've seen. Interested to know if there are any countries other than the US where the domestic transfer system is expensive, slow, and shitty if anyone happens to have some examples.

Saddest thing for me about Bitcoin all these years is watching all the smart people who really don't deserve to lose their money lose it. 
assholes: 'lol windows'
me: remembering one the top Bitcoin researcher's in the world with a PhD getting his 9k BTC wallet on his Linux machine emptied.
assholes: 'cold wallets only or stfu' 
me: remembers a few years ago someone with a good degree from one of the top schools in the world losing access to their savings via not being able to reproduce the passphrase. 
And countless other examples really.
Shit like this just always happens. Not that I'm saying there's anything that can really be done, or that people aren't ultimately at fault and responsible. But it sucks, and happens and will continue to happen to anyone really. It's just the harsh reality of the technology I guess. Hopefully the amount isn't life changing for you and doesn't affect negatively your life much more than an emotional bruise. 
I was unaware of this Electrum vuln. I've always used it as a hot wallet since 2012, and until very recently, I've been using older versions. Not sure but I think 2.8.3 is the exact same one I last used before I did a recent format and redownloaded. I've always used Electrum since it's so convenient. I could have easily lost money from this, and apparently was just lucky that I was never on a specific website that was exploiting the bug while my wallet was open.

Maybe, hopefully. But people shouldn't delude themselves about the true state of Bitcoin right now going into 2018 with all the mental gymnastics so many people like to use on here. Bitcoin is super mainstream now, it's now more of a question of where it goes from here and how rather than 'getting in before it's mainstream'.
Basically, now the real work begins in building economic value rather than just the early speculation.

Under a dollar was whatever and I can't really say about what opinions or reasoning people had back then since at that point it was barely notable on slashdot or maybe hackernews or whatever. And Satoshi was still around working on getting it working at a reasonable level first. Wasn't really much of a market until it hit parity with the USD in early 2011 and there was finally a 'legit'(lol) exchange. At that point it spread throughout the internet quite a bit leading up to the first major bubble to $32. Not only that but it was already hitting mainstream news and you had politicians like Chuck Schumer publicly speaking out against Bitcoin. So it was on the radar pretty early so to speak.
And by then there were absolutely people who were buying and predicting some 'insane' scenarios of how it could take off. Just go back and read bitcointalk archives if you're interested. Lots of crazy people on there from various walks of life who held particular world views that Bitcoin spoke to on a very deep and fundamental level. Even when it went back to $2 then floated around $10 around 2011-2012 there were a lot of people who were very serious and very optimistic about what they thought was going to happen and they absolutely deserve credit for taking the risk that they did. If you ever spent time on bitcointalk or even here over the years you'd know how common the seemingly arrogant idea that Bitcoin was extremely likely to be worth a lot of money is/was. And some people put their money where their mouth was.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:21:51
It's always been like that from day one, and the market knows it. It's not 12.5k because people are expecting it to compete with credit cards. It's 12.5k because it's an entirely new asset class for a new century that has unique attributes that are similar to gold and other precious metals.

The whole 'debate' was centered on on chain vs off chain scaling though is what I was getting at. At first segwit was 'great', but they needed a block increase right away and it was an emergency. They claimed segwit and things that relied on segwit like LN were vaporware that might not ever appear. When it was ready to go new excuses were created and a full year of delays resulted.
Thankfully the people who are fine with centralization being an acceptable trade off are now backing Bitcoin Cash. In the end it worked out pretty well. Save for some minor annoyance with them trying to co-opt the Bitcoin brand name and literally claim that Bitcoin Cash is the 'real' Bitcoin. That's pretty ridiculous, but much better than the 2-3 years of bullshit political games and power grabs that was the so-called 'debate'.

Many of them had what I consider foolish and wrong reasons for why they thought BTC would gain value*. But at the end of the day it didn't and doesn't matter what weird economic view or political delusions they hold, they still won the game.
*Although the general idea about high demand for something that's inheretly limited in supply wasn't and isn't wrong. Lots of people could do the math regarding that. The issues are more about how, where, when, and why that demand would arise. But like I said, it doesn't really matter.

BTC opens a completely new dimension and incentive for kidnapping and robbery. People really need to realize that. Getting someone's private keys worth millions is vastly more plausible than somehow getting them to accomplish some reversible, traceable bank transfer worth millions. 
People are going to be tortured, and people are going to die. Assuming such things haven't happened already. Everyone needs to realize that privacy and security are of paramount importance. Unfortunately we live in a world where there are people that will do such things for relatively small amounts of money, let alone multiple BTC.

It makes me sick thinking about the amount of scamming that must be going on right now.
As much as it would be ideal if everyone could properly secure their own cold wallet, I can't help but think that regular people as a group will be better served by being able to invest in BTC through a bank, an ETF, or perhaps these new futures. It will just be another investment for them. I know that some people will find that sacrilege, but I do think it will be much better for the average person.

I don't really understand how people can ever complain about 'insider trading' in Bitcoin of all things. Bitcoin wouldn't be Bitcoin if insider trading was a thing.

Like it is possible that with LN and some sort of credit card-like offering from a business it could someday be reasonable to use for purchases? Sure.

Eh, it's not so bad now. I see a fair amount of people congratulating people who are getting out and buying houses and cars, or paying off debt ect.
Really at this price the potential upside is fairly limited comparatively when you consider the world economy. Sure, BTC could get in to the trillion(s) market cap range, but even for that it's only like a 5-20x situation. Where as the crazy thing about BTC before was that when you invested at $10 or $100, it was semi-plausible that one day BTC would actually go to $10k for a 100-1000x return. The potential upside was insane. 
Pretty much anyone who's not already cash wealthy should be selling down to BTC being a smallish percentage of their portfolio imo. The risk vs reward situation now just isn't the same.

Yes, but it's also a bit weird and sad that there are still people trying argue that Bitcoin isn't mainstream yet.
Especially since we already had Chuck Schumer speaking out against itand being reported on mainstream news back in 2011. Anyone who even remotely follows the news has heard of Bitcoin multiple times over the years as at least seen it mentioned, even if they didn't take notice of it.
Also kind of funny that CNBC calls this person an early investor because they bought GBTC of all things(not that it's bad) in 2015. I think we still have quite a few years to go before someone who bought in at year 7 of 9 can be considered 'early'.

The issue is that economic confidence in Bitcoin itself can be lost. Even if fundamentally there's nothing really wrong, paper BTC can crash real BTC. Manipulation can happen. 
Not that I know of any way to stop it or anything like that. I don't. It might just be similar to gold and silver markets where all kinds of crazy shit will happen despite the actual underlying asset sharing similar properties to real bitcoin. Probably just inevitable.
Ironically, like the article, the only way to prevent such things might actually be 'regulation'(not that I actually think there's any reasonable chance of decent regulation happening). No regulation and the 'extremely likely to be poor regulation' both lead down dark tunnels.

The paper BTC market will undoubtedly be huge, and will likely have an effect on the broader BTC market in general. 
I remember people who got out of silver in 2011 got into BTC specifically because they said the same manipulation via paper that was going on in the silver market back then(check the charts) wouldn't be able to happen with BTC. Between this and Tether, I think it's safe to say they were mistaken.

Things could have gone so much worse than they did if people weren't serious about standing up for Bitcoin back then(you included(being an understatement really)).
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:01:44




I think you've found a solid indicator.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:28:36
Maybe. But Bitcoin has been a huge online community for years now. Even if it's bs, it might as well be real as there's tons of people in similar situations. Rarely have I seen many long term holders seriously freaking out. Once people essentially secure themselves financially in the real world, the numbers on the screen going up and down literally don't affect their daily life, or the life of their family in the slightest. It's not that hard to imagine a decent amount of emotional detachment at that point. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 12:21:44
I've always found the whole 'weak hands' thing really cringy. All the emotionally charged phrases and memes that people come up with during volatile periods would be funny if they weren't a bit sad with the constant justification and trying to feel better about losing money. Especially when you realize that it's some lame attempt to influence others.

I've noticed that people have stopped mentioning the baseline block size increase that was generally considered very likely and necessary for LN, and part of the Core scaling roadmap.
Is this because we'll be able to effectively do the same thing with a segwit block-weight soft fork increase if needed? Or is there something else I missed?
It's awesome that we beat back 2x, the ver/jihan attacks, ect. But I'm not seeing the general wheels in motion towards a legit, safe, rational block size increase that I expected in 2018 or 2019. I have no expectations on how many bytes that may actually be either. Also, the people who matter could very well be discussing and planning exactly this, and it's just being drowned out by the recent flood of price talk ect, which would be good to hear and I'm not claiming it's not happening because I really just don't know. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:11:49

To truly say that you kind of need to be able to guarantee that you can run your own node if it came down to it I think.

@_date: 2017-12-17 10:29:56
Doing the math on that I'm guessing would make that seem pretty unlikely. Unless the unit that you're comparing the value of BTC with begins losing value in a similarly crazy way. But then you're not really generating real returns anyway.

No, it doesn't have the same consensus rules. Thus it hard forked into a new blockchain that is now completely different.
Bitcoin already has a miner centralization problem. BCH takes that problem and amplifies it by some insane amount. Jihan has way too much power already on Bitcoin. Anyone buying into BCH and thinking it's anything other than extremely lacking in decentralization is deluding themselves.
And that's not even touching on the whole Ver thing. It's a joke that's not funny because there are real people buying into it.

The whole ecosystem has been predicated on Bitcoin actually succeeding from the beginning. I understand what you're getting at here, but it doesn't apply to what I'm saying as it was never that type of situation. Altcoins were like completely irrelevant until maybe late 2013. Even Litecoin was barely notable for a long time. Not only that, but to use Litecoin as an example, the whole concept of Litecoin's success was based upon the assumption that Bitcoin would be successful, or too successful, thus the need for Litecoin(I'm not making this claim, but that's the concept).
It was never a case where Bitcoin was just one of many and happened to be the lucky winner while everything else died off. It was a completely new technology and there was nothing like it.
Certainly not claiming anything about following anyone's advice though. Like I said in the post, a lot of these people are completely wrong about many things. But they were right about Bitcoin and their zealotry paid off big time even if a lot of the times it was completely misguided.

Being a scarce decentralized digital asset with unique properties that can fit in the global economy. Similar to gold, but far more flexible. Another way to store or move value around to diversify everyone's economic options and not necessarily have to rely on governments or corporations.

What do you mean non-standard? What other standard measures of inflation are there other than the two I listed: 
Money supply inflation where the base money supply increases, as Bitcoin will for our lifetime. Or price inflation where the cost of goods increase relative to the price of the currency.
I don't understand how you can say it's 'inflation-proof' in the first sentence and then specifically refer to the inflation it undergoes in the second sentence(even if it's 'only' that) and say that what I'm saying would be non-standard.
If people want to invent some new term to decribe the uniqueness of Bitcoin's predictable money supply inflation, that would probably be a good idea. But people have been calling it 'deflationary', 'non-inflationary', or 'inflation-proof' for years by mistake when it doesn't meet any of those definitions as defined by to what inflation refers to in both of it's historical usages.  
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:58:21
Historically anything to do with payments(particularly those that convert to fiat) has been viewed by the market as either negative or neutral.
Back in 2013 when Microsoft first started accepting bitcoin the market had a pretty sharp and immediate drop. In fact there are probably threads on this sub you can dig up. It was a meme for a long while about dumping btc as soon as you hear another big vendor is taking it to convert it to fiat.

No, you're missing the big issue.
There's nothing wrong with putting small amounts of money on to a centralized service for it to be used in an efficient manner. The risk vs reward is clearly defined. It's like loading your card for the subway. 
That's not even touching on the fact that using LN isn't even the same as using a centralized service for small cash transactions. 
Trying to use the layer that matters with the big money and the big security, that has a real cost for that security and decentralization, for trivial purchases and amounts of money is really quite wasteful and silly.

Money supply inflation specifically is the increase of the money supply. But people generally refer to price inflation when they talk about inflation in the modern sense, yes.


That's quite a big claim to make. It's possible it's true...but even the biggest bull has to realize that there's a set of possible futures where this isn't the case at all. Lots of bad things can happen. There's nothing special about Bitcoin that *guarantees* that at all. If it offers enough utility to people then demand can outstrip supply and the price can increase as it has thus far. But it's not magic just because the emission schedule decreases at a fixed rate. People still need to buy more than they sell.

I don't know anything about the pricing of reddit accounts, but the fact that it's always been insta signup with nothing needed must mean that the supply of accounts is massive.
edit: I reread my post and what I meant by excessive was not price but excessively obvious that it's likely a bought account. So perhaps it's not since personally I think it would be stupid to buy such an account and try to passive off such an eye catching signup date as legit. I mean it gets pointed out in threads as we can see. Thats assuming someone buying accounts would actually try to 'blend in' or something like that though.

I don't think 'firing Core' is a wise move at all. And I honestly don't think that most of the people who signed on for the NYA had any idea that's what they were signing on to.
For example, after the NYA was public Erik Voorhees came on here and explicitly said that he didn't want to fire Core at all. So obviously there's been a huge disconnect here considering Erik is probably a lot more tuned into everything than most others are.
What you call FUD, I call people trying to make the reality of the situation known so that people who were mislead can see the mistake they made by signing on.
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:32:09
How many of them signed knowing that they were signing on to a contentious hard fork that will 'fire Core' and result in a very major chain split with a massive amount of the user base supporting the proven project(Core of course)?
I doubt very many of them had any idea what they were signing on to or how serious it is. A few of them are laughing at the rest because it's exactly what they want. I'm pretty sure lots of people have been misled here. I would like to see some explicit statements otherwise if I'm wrong, because this is a big deal.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:10:17
Why not let them actually try their scaling road map and give them a proper shot at doing it without all of this political bs though? Seems likely that we'll see a hard fork with a blocksize increase at some point in the near future if it's indicated by the data anyway. Doing it this way is just insanity.
Agreements like the NYA just seem totally ridiculous to me. It's like a complete slap in the face and completely unnecessary. Especially now that the group that was causing all the strife has seemingly mostly moved on to their own BCH chain now. Why don't people trust that Core as a project contains reasonable people doing their best job? It seems so obvious to me that the only reason there's this mistrust or perception of Core not scaling Bitcoin is because that narrative was crafted by people like Roger and Jihan who seem to have their own agendas. But nothing I've seen in reality actually aligns with any of the negative rhetoric that they've pushed. The fact that so many miners and businesses have apparently bought into that is really worrying.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:50:57
It still doesn't "increase the block reward". I think that's a poor choice of words still. It incentives exploitation that results in higher than intended inflation, but block reward refers to something pretty specific.

If the people who signed the agreement are prepared to alienate and reject the Core open source software project and come up with a new project to develop a referrence client on their new chain, that's fine.
If by doing that, they understand and are willing to lose a large portion of the user base who realizes the magnitude and achievement that Core has produced, and appreciates the work that the people have contributed, as well as the calm and measured approach to trying to design with decentralization and security in mind, that's fine.
If they truly understand what they are doing, and believe it's in their best interest to attempt to push through a 90 day hard fork right after Segwit has been activated and the mempool is looking good, then that's fine.
If that's their prerogative, then I wish them luck on their new chain just as I do now with BCC.
I don't understand why you would call the people who feel the way I wrote insane though. My honest opinion is that the miners and companies who want to make such a massive play for no apparent gain whatsoever(unless they truly want to 'fire Core') are acting in a way that I'd call insane given available information.
I hope they realize that the so called civil war has been instigated by a fairly small but well funded group of people with extreme opinions who now appear to be thankfully moving on to their own chain now(BCC). So if these businesses and miners felt compelled to 'take action' in any way other than activating the first step of Core's scaling roadmap that's been on ice for over a year now(Segwit), they should realize that the situation has changed and it's simply irrational to try to hold on to some agreement 'just because'.
That doesn't mean that Bitcoin won't see a hard fork blocksize increase in the near future if it's indicated based on the state of the network and the considerations toward decentralization. But hey, let's take a deep breath first and see how things go and take a look at the data first before trying to pull hard forks out of our ass that *actually* fracture the community and create yet another chain split under the guise of some sort of "compromise".
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:41:58


Ehh, I can easily see us wanting to differentiate between centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency. You can try fight to have that word imply decentralization, but it's such a nebulous concept that I don't think you're going to win that language war.
At what point does Bitcoin's current centralization problem progress to the point that we lose the ability to call it a cryptocurrency? What percentage of Bitcoin mining needs to be within the same geopolitical area to maintain the title of cryptocurrency? If it's 95%, is it still decentralized? And if it's not decentralized, then if not cryptocurrency, what do we call it? How many nodes and at what geographic spread? How much of a monopoly on mining equipment do we tolerate before Bitcoin becomes 'not a cryptocurrency'?
If Ethereum ends up hosted on ~10 data centers across the world, at what point as it condenses towards centralization does it become 'not a cryptocurrency'? Is it the physical locations or the amount of people who have some measure of control that matter?
There's quite a few altcoins that I've seen over the years seem to have various properties that would be consistent with what you might expect a cryptocurrency to have, but can't be called decentralized by any reasonable person.
More specific language is better imo. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. But Bitcoin does not automatically retain decentralization. And decentralization is a big spectrum. Having it become 'not a cryptocurrency' at some vague point on the spectrum towards centralization doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:57:40
By the nature of the agreement, anyone who supports Bitcoin Core necessarily doesn't support the 2x hard fork. 
We can assume for the sake of argument that both Bitcoin Core, and 2x have a significant number of supporters. If Bitcoin Core has a lot of support, and I think it's very clear that it does and has earned that support over the years, then naturally that makes 2x contentious.
If 2x supporters are so intent on 'firing Core' that they are willing to go forward with their new blockchain and do another chain split in a few months, then they should do that. Thinking that 2x was going to happen any other way makes little sense to me. My impression is that apparently supporters of 2x have been mislead to think otherwise. This is concerning. Everyone should understand what they are buying into before they participate in such 'agreements'. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:47:42
Yes, but it's convenient to ignore because it doesn't benefit anyone financially in the short term to point it out and complain. Especially since the secret sauce of Bitcoin is decentralization. Maybe the market prices the harsh reality in already? Who knows.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:12:43
Yeah, but if those forks and weirdos actually cause Bitcoin's blocks to slow down and its hash rate to drop significantly that would be bad. Bitcoin is supposed to be the sacrosanct one above all of that altcoin style bs. If Bitcoin Cash of all things can seriously have that big of an effect on Bitcoin, then it's pretty embarrassing for something that I'm hoping is robust enough to eventually become one of the backbones of the global financial system.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:50:41
I find the fact that there seem to be a fair amount of people in the community who somehow developed a Bitcoin worldview that miners are the definitive controllers of the protocol odd and concerning. Especially that it seems there are people with significant financial stake in Bitcoin such people involved in legitimate Bitcoin businesses that hold this view. It's scary.
It comes off to me as something like "I'm more comfortable in a system where I can cede my free thought and just follow an objective indicator like hashrate regardless of who, or what is behind it.". It seems irrational. But I can almost understand it too, as you can see that there are quite a few people in this world who tend to gravitate and are attracted to the idea of submitting to something they perceive as a greater power. Not having to think and decide things for yourself can be a hell of a drug I guess. 
It is true that Bitcoin was sold to many people in this way though. I won't deny that. When in my opinion, in reality it's actually something that will only work in the long run if its user base as a whole is constantly vigilant and actively tries to sort through the bullshit and fight to keep it decentralized. Clearly the incentives to do so are far weaker than anyone ever thought going into this thing years ago. People have all kinds of motivations to shape Bitcoin in their own vision and it's only going to work if the people who realize that Bitcoin is a joke without decentralization resist that.
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:14:17


Is far different than making the claim that:

Of course, which is why it's silly that there's a few people on here trolling about the fact that there wasn't some kind of magical worldwide implementation of segwit on all wallets and instantaneous lowering of fees. It's ridiculous that people are acting smug and like segwit is a failure mere hours after the soft fork.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:36:34


The funny thing is that while they absolutely think that what they want to do is more profitable than what most of us want, they're also extremely likely to be completely wrong. The market right now suggests that, but besides that vague indicator I think it's pretty clear that a healthy, decentralized Bitcoin built smart and strategically for the long haul is obviously going to be more profitable.
You have one set of people who are comfortable with data center sized nodes, and then you have another group that's literally launching nodes into space to literally put them out of reach of every person on this planet.
That says it all really.

Isn't it awesome that Bitcoin evolved in to a totally decentralized system where one giant piece of shit makes virtually all the mining chips? /s
Not that this really has much to do with anything, but it's an annoying reminder of who currently has far too much power. And even more annoying that Jihan and co are just straight up bad actors and don't even really care to hide it since they know there's nothing anyone can do right now realistically.
Something needs to break soon so Bitcoin can move on from Bitmain. For once I'm actually thinking maybe the Chinese government nationalizing their domestic Bitcoin mining might actually be a good thing in the long run. The rest of the world would just nope the fuck out of that and we'd leave China to its own devices while we all get a second chance at actually making Bitcoin decentralized. 
I mean obviously that would suck in the short term, markets would shit themselves ect. But in the long term it might actually be healthier. The situation as it is now is seriously bad and I'm not seeing too many realistic ways out from under the claws of Bitmain and China in general.

Maybe they all know Jihan has them by balls already since from what I understand he's more or less the only game in town for ASICs at this point.
It would be tons of short term pain for sure, but I'm thinking we'd be much better off if somehow all the centralized Chinese mining just went off and did their own thing while Bitcoin re-decentralized itself. Like you say, no one would follow them. But I could see the communist party forcing them on to their own chain with some government mandated consensus rules or something. Baked in AML/KYC or something like that.

This is excellent news. People who don't want Core and want 2x with btc1 or whatever will be able to do so on their own blockchain. If there's seriously as much support as they claim to have with business and miners, they should be able to have a real go at it and I wish them luck.
Personally I'm going to be 100% the Bitcoin chain that conforms to the consensus rules we have now.  
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:50:49
? Core wasn't even invited afaik.
I mean, I think 'firing Core' is stupid, and I doubt that's what the people who signed on to the NYA thought they were doing. But if they're fine with that and the implications of that decision then that's fine with me. It'll just be another chain split and I know which one I'll be on.
I used to think chain splits weren't worth it, but now post-BCH and 2 years of drama I think I'm fine with just doing it if people on both sides feel that strongly.
However, I highly doubt that there will be enough support for the 2x portion of Segwit2x. It just doesn't make sense in this context at all. But I won't fight it either way. My main concern is just making sure people really know what they're buying into here. If 2x people hate Core and want to get rid of the project and manage their own chain post 2x hard fork then they have the right idea. If not then they're making a huge mistake.

If what you wrote actually happens it's a pretty major problem for Bitcoin. Kind of threatens the whole concept of stable ultra secure store of value. If we do get into that altcoin style miner jumping game, which I have seen happen often with hash rentals and such in alts, then I think it greatly hurts the value proposition of Bitcoin being above all that due to its market position as the leader. Particularly with the 2016 block adjustment period. 
I hope you are wrong, but I can't say that it's impossible if miners want to shoot themselves in the head over short term profitability calcs and such. I have zero faith in and respect for the current set of miners now anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:56:33
The 2MB blocks isn't what I care about at all, I don't have a problem with any blocksize that makes sense from a technical perspective when considering decentralization. And high transaction fees with no alternative will obviously incentivize people to use other blockchains, so it's not a good thing. It's 'firing Core' for no reason and switching to btc1 with a short notice hard fork. That would be it for me as far as Bitcoin goes if that were to happen successfully and a Core chain didn't exist in any appreciable state.
And the fact that it wasn't expected to be contentious demonstrates malice on the part of the people pushing it. Misleading people to sign it by selling it as a non-contentious hard fork rather than just another XT/Classic/BU political gambit to 'fire Core'. I highly doubt many people who signed it really realized what they were signing on for.
I don't see how you can find people that object to that amusing.

 I honestly don't think most had any idea of what they were agreeing to in the first place. But if they seriously want to go on a new chain to uphold the 'agreement' for some moral reason or something then it will be interesting to see how that works out.
They should at least revisit the agreement. I don't think trying to be reasonable is dishonest if everyone is invited to participate and make their feelings based on the updated situation known.
To me this kind of reminds me of Brexit. Like they're walking down a path where most people would stop if given another chance(my impression at least, not a fact obviously), but they feel obligated to complete it.

There's absolutely no reason to do the 2x part now that they have their own blockchain. 
The only reason to go forward with the 2x part would be if people really wanted to 'fire Core' and go with btc1. That's going to result in another chain split though since I can't imagine too many people seriously thinking that's a wise plan.

isn't required right now, but not a big problem if it happens...
You don't consider hard forking to the apparently poorly managed btc1 software project over Bitcoin Core a 'big problem'?
To me it's the biggest problem I've ever seen in Bitcoinland. You would think the economic backbone of the Bitcoin business world wouldn't be so ready to toss aside the best set of Bitcoin developers in the world, and the presumably very large part of the user base that will continue to run Bitcoin Core.

The US consumer banking system is already 10-15 years behind the rest of the world. Even newly developing countries bank systems are set up so that people can send instant transfers domestically. 
The US in general seems to be falling behind in a number of ways. The tech companies and the quality higher education keep the potential there. But if they ever lose whatever incentive they have now to stay in the US and make some sort of exit(tech companies mainly), not sure what's going to happen.

Is anyone else ok with that as someone who's against 2x? If people are unhappy with Core, then we don't have to fight amongst ourselves. You have your own chain to which you can transfer your property, and ability to put your ideas to the test now.

It will hurt both chains economically. It can't be considered a postive thing at all for either the Bitcoin chain or the 2x chain.
2x is just fantastically unwise.

Bitcoin and free markets simply don't have as strong self-regulating incentives as people once assumed they did. Myself included. 
I don't blame Bitmain for their monopoly. I do blame them for the way they act and the way they use or abuse their power. Especially since I generally think that they act irrationally in a manner that damages not only themselves, but every other economic actor in Bitcoin.
It's like I don't blame Roger Ver for being in Bitcoin super early and amassing a large fortune, if anything I respect him for that. But I certainly do blame him for how he's turned that power into a weapon with which he attacks Bitcoin with though.

Even if there is significant activity on this chain that splits off, I'm comfortable with going all-in on the Bitcoin chain and developers that have consistently demonstrated excellence over the years. 
When the time comes for the blocksize to be raised after cool hearted consideration, weighing the tradeoffs, and careful analysis of the data leading up to it, I'll be 100% any such changes. But doing this random super quick hard fork to 2MB now as a 'compromise' that's no longer necessary now that the damaging minority has moved on to BCH seems...unwise at best.

Essentially borrowing money with interest to buy more where if the price goes down to a certain amount your broker will automatically sell what you own to pay off the loan before you get too deep in the hole(margin call).

Personally I'd definitely call the exploit that created the block that mined a billion or whatever BTC a hack.
Of course the blockchain was rolled back(obviously, else we wouldn't be having this conversation about Bitcoin in 2018 if it wasn't).
I think it's a bit disingenuous for OP to say it's never been hacked.
The only argument you can use is that it was an 'exploit' rather than a 'hack'. But by that definition any hack that succeeds by exploiting something is no longer a 'hack'. And that doesn't really make much sense.

On top of that it's been extremely entertaining to follow Bitcoin from close to the beginning and have a front row seat for it all.

Bitcoin store wasn't the first online store to take Bitcoin from what I remember. Was in either 2011 or 2012 else I wouldn't have remembered it launching, so it was a few years in. Maybe first to only accept Bitcoin, not sure.

He was part of BitInstant with Erik and Charlie too. That was a pretty big thing back then.
Bitconica was pretty snazzy while it lasted too. He invested in a lot of projects.

@_date: 2017-08-09 07:37:24
I absolutely disagree that there was any kind of widespread rejoicing here. Yeah, sure. 
There were and are people here that seem to support 2x, which is fine. The question to me is, of the people you refer to who appeared to support the 2x part of Segwit2x, did they even realize that not only was Core not invited, but that 2x would be a chain split that effectively 'fires Core'? 
I suspect most people were like Erik Voorhees who explicitly stated on here after the NYA that he had no desire or intention to fire Core. So perhaps the large majority of the support you observed for the 2x portion of the NYA was simply under false pretenses?
Also, it's amazing to me that we can have such wildly differing perspectives on this. Because from my point of view, the NYA itself is GoT level trickery, where signers and users were never fully informed that the agreement is a total rejection of the Bitcoin Core project and entails moving to a completely new reference software implementation.
And given that it follows that assuming there's any reasonable level of support for Bitcoin Core, a chainsplit will result. Yet I never got the impression that anyone who supported NYA really either understood or believed this.

Kick the can? This will enable things like Lightning that have the actual potential to be full scale scaling solutions while keeping a decentralized Bitcoin.

What do you mean? The exploit is obviously fixed now but the fact of the matter is that it happened and the coins were mined in what was accepted as a valid block by nodes until it was manually noticed by a person.
If you mean because it's harder for someone to mine a block now, that doesn't really change the fact that we are super lucky that the hack/exploit happened way back when and not now where it would make international headlines. Would be the worst possible publicity.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:21:38
So is there a serious dev team ready to take over development of the referrence client on the new chain?
In theory it's possible. In my experience though most of the talent tends towards Core once they take the time to fully understand the issues surrounding Bitcoin. The talent definitely exists in the world in great numbers, but it's like trying to get scientists to come out against climate change. Once they take the time to understand the issue, only a few are going to be willing to forego the evidence and come out on the other side. Of course, money can make such things happen. So if there's millions of dollars lined up to really attract talented people who can run a project like Bitcoin and are fast learners, it's possible in theory. But trying to rival top people that have years of in the trenches experience like people working on Core have is going to be extremely difficult and not going to happen overnight. This type of thing should really be planned a couple of years in advance imo. Then you and grow your Core-usurping talent to actually have a chance over that time period.

Stuff like that is the most disturbing thing about mining monopoly/centralization. Both actual mining under different identities, and then this type of cut and paste stuff to give the illusion of decentralization. 
The worst part about it too is that everyone wants it to be true, and really wants mining to be decentralized since we all have financial stake in Bitcoin actually doing and being what it's supposed to be. So there's an inherent bias there.

Well now that BTC has shot up this year it does seem like there are going to be some new competitors entering the arena.
But what I think happened is something like Chinese miners in general have had a huge advantage from favorable power costs from the local hydro generation plants and such. This pushed out a lot of the international competitors who both mined and produced ASICs(KnC miner, 21 Inc, Bitfury ect) and Bitmain happened to produce hardware that was good enough and in large enough amounts that they became the main supplier for everyone.
The cheap power could have come from legal government subsidies  or illegal corruption, but either way similar situations are probably quite hard to find outside of China.
I don't believe they have their own fab for the reasons you state there. They do probably have some sweet deals though with the amount of volume they do.

If they see Bitcoin on the news as the price goes up and ask you about it the new strategy is to say:

So far the US and other companies have simply been out competed by Bitmain or others. BFL and 21 Inc are two that spring to mind as far as US companies that developed ASICs go.
The way the world is going now, China is going to be very tough to compete with in many markets. 
Apparently some Japanese company is going to give it a go with SHA256 ASICs, but I try not to get my hopes up too much.

When the person is the one who owns the sub itself it makes sense.
I'm not claiming that everyone who posts in is involved in attacks. In fact I have seen quite a few people who post there who are well aware of how bad Ver is, and don't buy into to his schemes. And if anything, it would be healthier for that side of the community to start fresh in a non-Ver controlled sub.

Banning would be a good start. The sub is literally run as a commercial operation to funnel users to a bait and switch commercial website(bitcoin.com, which isn't actually about Bitcoin). I don't think they try to hide it even though from what I understand that's not how subs are meant to be used. Various stickies, sidebar full of direct links is just the start. (edit: Also the sub itself was purchased by Roger Ver from whomever had control of it before. I'm not sure if that's against reddit policy, but it sounds sketchy as you don't want people parking and flipping subs like they do with domains I'd imagine)
And we're talking about people with at least hundreds of millions of dollars here who are unrelenting and have been running these types of attacks since 2015 at least.
There's no easy solution, but since you can clearly see what is actually going on here, anything from reddit that might at least warn regular users and help avoid them getting swept up in what is at least misinformation, and at worst actual scams would be good.

They don't need to 'get away' with anything though. Some games are pay to win and don't hide that fact. Some aren't.

He got in early and was already rich before discovering Bitcoin. He bought a lot of it. As of now he apparently controls at least 45k BTC. Over the years people speculated that he probably held a six-figure amount of BTC. Also owns bitcoin.com which is troublesome.
He's not really a good guy and kind of went off the deep end the last few years.
It's not only him though. Lots of people with lots of different ambitions have been able to become quite wealthy off Bitcoin and use that money to attempt to influence the politics of Bitcoin. 
In terms of decentralization, imo the real issue is the mining centralization and monopoly or near-monopoly on hardware that Jihan Wu and Bitmain have. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:59:17
 in case you may have missed him covering for what turned out to be a loss of something like 800k BTC(don't remember the exact number, but it's something like that).

In that case yeah, Satoshi definitely saw big mining but everyone's assumption was that there would be further incentives towards decentralization. As in the market wouldn't support such obvious centralization. But the reality is quite different. It's not anyone's fault, I personally just have far less faith in 'market forces' due to the fallible nature of the people behind them. In reality people just seem to favor short term thinking.

Satoshi wasn't clairvoyant and definitely missed a lot of things. Not that I blame him for that at all, it was intended to grow into something where the community itself would solve issues that arise, not Satoshi himself. And so far that's what's happened more or less. Bitmain just happens to be the biggest issue ever that has no apparent solution. 
Satoshi himself didn't even foresee pooled mining. He did enough just coming up and creating the base concept. Trying to fully extrapolate all the possibilities is a bit much when you're fully engrossed in just getting your invention off the ground.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:49:28
Lightning is pretty cool, but I see it more as something that prevents demand from shifting to other cryptos within the market to help sustain value, rather than something that itself will generate new outside demand. Consumer day to to spending is still vastly outcompeted by things like credit cards that offer consumer protection from fraud, cash back, travel insurance ect. Something could change in the future, but for now the consumer is king, and competing in that arena will be a very tough nut to crack.
There's international money transfers too. But that depends on the liquidity of Bitcoin, the spread on both ends, and the last mile availability. Again, tough nut to crack. But perhaps more plausible than consumer spending. Also depends on centralized finance not stepping up its game to compete as well in efficiency, and not pressuring governments to support its efforts by being the ones to persuading them to make sure those companies dealing with the fiat to BTC exchanging on both ends deal with regulatory pressure. 
There's a lot of big 'ifs'. All of this stuff is well known and has been discussed for years related to Bitcoin becoming something people really *use* rather than a digital asset that is hopefully a store of value. People know it's a novel, useful digital asset. The 'currency' idea has always been pretty wishy-washy at best. Not completely absurd, but a big long shot in a modernizing economic world where people are sending instant domestic bank to bank transfers for free with their phones and such for 5 or 10 years already(not the US, but elsewhere). It's awesome as a cryptographically secure store of value that you can truly hold on to yourself though. It's advantages are exceptionally unique. But people also often try to push the square peg into the circular shaped hole a bit too much in the name of the 'pump'. It's always the same cycle.
That's just for the mainstream though. For someone like myself who uses crypto, and very begrudgingly made some transactions with non-BTC to try save the $10-$20 bucks or whatever, I'm personally super excited that I won't have to deal with that bullshit ever again thanks to LN and segwit. So that is pretty awesome. Very happy that the last two years of attacks and bs are seemingly behind us and the technology is coming to fruition. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:15:30
Pools were a novel thing at the time, so no. 
Why is it so surprising to you? And he didn't really come up with the mining concept specifically. Adam Back created Hashcash, which Satoshi adapted in to what we know as mining today.
Pooled mining is such a huge factor in Bitcoin that if it was known it obviously should have been included in the white paper or at least discussed significantly in the couple years or so leading up until Slash made the pool. We've had at least 3 periods where a mining pool has come close or breached the 50% hashrate mark based on blocks solved. Which is a huge deal.

I don't know why the community and the market collectively put their fingers in their ears and pretended that Chinese centralization and the Chinese government wasn't a massive, massive problem. I guess it's easy when everyone is making money in the short term. 
The government doesn't even have to lift a finger to destroy Bitcoin in China. People argued about them marching into mining complexes with jackboots and guns and whether or not that was plausible. But the reality is that every single Chinese citizen will instantly submit to even a crooked glance by the government. Because that's what you do when you have an authoritarian single party government with virtually absolute power. They don't actually have to fight any sort of war on Bitcoin at a packet level or physically seize anything really. That's the kind of power you have as a government in these types of situations. It's not the west.
Anyone expecting some serious blackmarket Bitcoin underground resistance springing up in China is due for disappointment. If the Chinese government is even remotely interested in killing demand for Bitcoin in China, they will easily do so.
And honestly governments across the world will almost all have it in their power to constrain Bitcoin if they want to. People have to accept that a 'successful' flourishing Bitcoin is completely at the will of governments. People don't want to believe that, and so many people have built up this project as some sort of power greater than the state, but the state controls way too many resources that Bitcoin relies on. From the companies that provide internet, to power generation, to the flow of capital necessarily for a liquid Bitcoin market, and more. It's not really plausible that 'the state' is going to be 'defeated' by something that relies too much on those things which Bitcoin certainly does not control. 
I'm sure the reality is not going to go down well with most people though. Bitcoin can still work out well and be a nice addition to the global financial system, giving us more control over capital. And I think it is doing that now and will continue. But the market has to smarten up and not allow situations like China to ever develop again if it really wants long term decentralized health.
Also that ICO shit was just stupid. Might as well wave a flag saying 'come regulate us'. Ultimately it's the market's fault for facilitating such stupidity. People are just naive and the market reflects that I guess. Hopefully we've collectively learned some lessons here though.

Except Localbitcoins shut down in Germany at one point with very little pressure or provocation from the government. And they're not based in Germany, or at least they weren't then. So don't get your hopes up for them to rebel or anything like that. Naturally companies are always going to comply to with the demands of governments seeing as how they are by their nature legal entities sanctioned by governments. 
Personally, I love LBC. A lot. But in general if people plan to put the future of Bitcoin in the hands of corporations, then that essentially equates to handing power over to governments. Which is why 2x is such a bad path to start walking down.
If there was a decentarlized version of LBC or something like that, then we'd have something interesting to speculate about here I guess. You'd need a trusted escrow though and that can be a bit tricky.

Or 2x, 2MB blocks, no plan, no team, no top developers, no consensus, no replay protection, just an absolute shit show where a bunch of clueless business people signed on to something that they obviously had no idea of what the implications would be and what it actually meant wrt to Bitcoin Core being 'fired', and a very large part of the community who will surely continue to support Core(ie a huge split).

I think Bitcoin would have a real chance in China if enough powerful members of the communist party had some of their personal wealth invested in it. As well as used it to move some of their own money abroad. 
It's a long shot, but Bitcoin could be saved in China if it turns out that's the case and enough phone calls get made. I'd imagine big players like Bitmain are already lobbying and passing envelopes since they have the most to lose it seems. Personally I'd rather see them go away though. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:53:44
You don't think government policy is capable of drastically reducing the demand for Bitcoin?
Bitcoin as a system relies on continued demand due to the inherent inflationary money supply that's a core part of its design. Not only that, but the incentive to secure the network is directly related to that demand, as network security via mining is inextricably linked to the market price of BTC.
Many people in this community over the years have loved to take the arrogant tone that you do here in thinking that Bitcoin is truly immune to government policy. But the reality is that Bitcoin is bound by the market. If the Chinese government really wants to do damage here, it obviously can, and the market knows it. Drying up Chinese demand would be a significant blow to Bitcoin, but won't kill it. But it demonstrates the power that governments have in reality. Thinking otherwise is just fantasy. If the US declared a 'war on Bitcoin' because of any bullshit political stance like terrorism or child porn, it could easily do even more damage. Don't fool yourself. It can survive in a technical sense, but you really don't want to kick the hornets nest if you can avoid it.
Bitcoin has to be agile, but right now it's not. The amount of Chinese centralization that the market allowed to happen is basically a complete failure of the project. The dangers should have been obvious, and maybe they were, but damned if most people simply didn't give a shit. In the long run this will be better for Bitcoin that the Chinese catastrophe happens now rather than later. I've said as much in recent months that I'd rather have something like this happen now so Bitcoin can attempt to redecentralize, and it looks like I might get my wish granted.

Just going to chime in and say that historically BTC price has tended to drop when a major retailer announces acceptance. For example, that happened a lot in 2013 with Microsoft, Dell, Newegg ect. And the price dipped so often that it even became a meme around here. People speculated that the reaction was because of the fact that these companies would just be insta-converting any BTC they get into USD, thus creating downward pressure. 
At least that is how the market seems to have reacted in the past. Who knows what it would do now, but just something to keep in mind.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:41:06
Hypothetically if 2x had actual solutions, developers, and technology then it would be a much more interesting situation than it is now.
I mean I'd actually expect this group of miners and businesses which put together certainly have valuations in the billions of dollars to being throwing millions at the project and trying to attract a world class team of developers. But all I'm seeing is a one man repo which thus far has been lackluster at best. 
I don't know what they're thinking at all with this whole thing. It just doesn't make sense. If they really want to 'fire Core', you'd think that in doing that their first priority would be trying to create a project full of experts and really try to actually compete on an intellectual and technical level with Core contributors.

Why is everyone so hung up on shorting? Selling and waiting for information is a normal, rational thing to do as well.
With Bitcoin it's one thing to try to time the market with buyins and tops with no major policy news or whatever - that's a different ball game. But being able to save money when obvious bad things happen like anything from the Chinese government is just common sense imo. Or Gox as it was before.

People can't be that stupid that they'd actually go through with 2x. Especially since Bitmain was funding Bitcoin ABC -&gt; BCC from day one.
If miners actually do that I'm just going to laugh. You would honestly have to be nuts to 'fire Core' and go with a one man piece of shit like btc1 as the new reference client.
In the long run it'd just be Chinese miners committing suicide. So whatever. It's going to be major pain the short term though for sure, yeah.

Bitmain has seemed to establish a monopoly on miners. If not physically controlling and mining with the majority of them, they do mine a lot with the latest models before selling them afaik and do put out a lot of hashrate. And apparently they were revealed to have a backdoor in them as well(Antbleed?). 
Honestly I'd be surprised if ultimately though whatever strings and controlled companies if Bitmain didn't mine 30%. That's just what I'd bet on if I had the opportunity to learn the truth, not making a claim that I know this for a fact. So take it for what it's worth.
It's a really bad situation. But for the most part I don't think it gets talked about much because it's not really in people's interest to draw attention to it too much. Especially since there's not much people can really do about it. Although supposedly there's a Japanese miner coming, as well as a competitive non-Bitmain chinese manufactured one also. But we'll see how that goes. Hopefully things change.

Bitcoin Cash is comparatively sane imo. This is just reckless, unnecessary.
You would never think in a million years that businesses which rely on a strong, technically stable Bitcoin would be behind such a thing. But here we are in crazy Bitcoinland where we get to witness 8 years of direct evidence about how irrational and emotional people can be even when faced with significant economic incentive to not to be.
I feel like I was so naive about how I truly believed that those with some of the biggest economic incentives would act. Like miners and businesses. Collectively they probably have the most to lose, but apparently a significant amount of them are comfortable putting the whole project on the line for reasons that aren't even an issue any longer.
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:17:13
'firing Core' and a split chain with a significant amount of people choosing to follow the consensus rules of Core rather than join 2x in abandoning the project.
Also the replay issue.
Also the fact that Bitcoin ABC funded by Bitmain ended up as a hard fork as BCH and took with them the very people they were trying to 'compromise' with to begin with. Making the whole 2x thing a non-issue.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:52:29
Why is everyone so hung up on shorting? Selling and waiting for information is a normal, rational thing to do as well.
With Bitcoin it's one thing to try to time the market with buyins and tops with no major policy news or whatever - that's a different ball game. But being able to save money when obvious bad things happen like anything from the Chinese government is just common sense imo. Or Gox as it was before.

How could anyone seriously think he's someone who doesn't honor his deals after all that has happened? Given BCH and the fact that btc1 is a total joke it's more than enough reason to consider the 'deal' invalid to begin with.
It's like saying you're going to jump off the bridge into the river tomorrow to everyone, but when tomorrow comes it turns out that the dam was closed and where water was yesterday there are only jagged rocks. The deal was made with various assumptions that have clearly changed. Not to mention it's also clear that hardly anyone who signed on to this thing had any idea what it meant. No way that all of those people would sign on to an agreement that splits Bitcoin into one side with miners and some businesses and the other side with a large amount of users and technical community.
It would be nice if people would just be reasonable and rational for once. The Core scaling plan looks good to me. I don't see what the problem is. Segwit is coming along great and that's just the beginning.

True, but in those cases they wouldn't claim that they're intending to replace Bitcoin or become the true Bitcoin by forking the actual Bitcoin blockchain.

Well, I mean Bitcoin has been a big thing on the internet for a long time and people have been buying and bag holding for most of those years since the bubbles were always very short compared to 2017.
People who were getting in post 2013 probably aren't the ones who made millions in most cases if it matters. ~10x-50x is a phenomenal return, but still takes a good solid 5 figure investment up front to hit 7 figures. Some people certainly invested that much, but if it makes you feel any better most people were only buying a few BTC rather than 100. Which is why I don't view people casually talking about buying BTC back then particularly skeptically, because the community was already huge and it wasn't a big deal to buy a few BTC.
Someone who bought 1 BTC at $300 can make the same statements as someone who bought 100 BTC and talk about bag holding and still be technically truthful without revealing the extent of the actual bag.

Obviously companies that are willing to throw away Bitcoin Core as a project and reference client are putting millions of dollars into finding a comparably large team of Bitcoin experts and respected academics. Put together I would have to guess they're worth over a billion in valuation, so naturally they'd use some money from all those VC fund raising rounds.
Anything else would be simply insane for something like Bitcoin which has only gotten to be worth tens of billions of dollars because it was lucky enough to interest a wide range of brilliant people to work on it thus far. Since that's clearly a fundamentally important part of Bitcoin's continued success, the people behind 2x must be hiding a large team of 10x coders, PhDs, and cryptographers that are going to be revealed at any moment now. 
Surely they wouldn't hard fork with a mediocre-at-best one man team on an open-but-closed source project.

People have been doing this with crypto since the days of GLBSE in like 2011 or 2012. But honestly, it's gone really badly for the most part. The general idea that the free market naturally has strong incentives against bad actors is one thing that I have a hard time believing after witnessing 7 years of crypto.
I'm curious to see some legit success stories eventually with lots of small investors reaping some real profits from a real business*. But there's also the huge issue that you're not legally protected as an investor, which could result in some bitter tears of people who were expecting a big ROI and some 'crypto executives' slimeball their way to screwing all the little guys who put in their $1k.
*Though this has actually happened with some gambling sites where people put in their money to provide the house bankroll if I remember correctly(dooglus). Gambling seems to be one area where crypto has legitimately made progress and real economic gains.

Most people thought it was due to the fact payment processors like Bitpay and Coinbase offer the merchant instant conversion to USD when people make purchases rather than holding most of the Bitcoin like a company like Overstock does.
In reality I think the market was just way over reacting. There's no way that enough people are buying enough computers or software to put any real sell pressure. Even back in 2013.
Now I'm very curious how the market would react to a major retailer accepting BTC in 2017 though. If I had to guess I'd probably expect no noticeable effect since it's so big now.

It's possible that this leads down a path that ends at an even worse situation than we have now with regards to privacy and freedom. It's probably best to at least care a little and try to avoid a corporate Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:45:31
It's always going to be a concern unless the world drastically changes in some way.
Also it depends on how things go with the protocol. If certain people got their wish and Bitcoin really did scale up on chain to the point where nodes needed to be hosted in data centers then it's an easy target. If people smarten up and keep it agile and stop fighting against the people who are trying make sure Bitcoin stays in a state in which it has plausibly survive in the long term then things might be ok. But we're not even at that point yet as evidenced by the fact that this 2x hard fork is actually a thing right now. A corporate Bitcoin without Core is just going to walk itself down a path of self destruction. The corporations by their very existence are beholden to governments and they will always comply. The only thing they can do is try to physically move to different regions, but I'm skeptical that all these companies that are still owned by VCs and such really have many viable options to evade governments.
It just seems like it's always going to be a fight. When you have people like Erik Voorhees advocating for 2x you know something's gone wrong in this community. People who based on past history you would expect to want a Bitcoin that has the best chance of surviving long term apparently live in a new world with a new worldview.

What happened to you? Supporting 2x and 'firing Core' is seriously misguided imo. And I'm honestly having trouble believing you think 2x has consensus considering you've always seemed pretty reasonable.
After Bitcoin Cash happened things should be ok now. No need to create more drama and fighting over nothing. Segwit is here, give Core an actual chance to implement their scaling roadmap now that they don't have miners holding them back for over a year(segwit).
I've personally been badly effected by the high fees and it's made a big impact on my livelihood. But I'm not willing to throw the whole project away for 2x. The risk vs reward here doesn't even come close to balancing out.

PoW change if absolutely necessary and a lot of people who still want to support Bitcoin will ensure it survives imo.
I agree that Bitcoin in general, people from every sub section of the community included, have problems with arrogant overconfidence. It's always been like that for everything unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:34:44
I think you're underhyping it because you leave out the fact that sha256 is a limited resource that also needs to be competed for. And if due to lacking that hashrate Bitcoin needs to change it's PoW, then the question of which one is truly 'Bitcoin' gets more complicated. It's going to be a fight for that network effect if that happens.

Funny looking back on that now considering how much Jeff wined about that if I'm remembering correctly. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:58:14
They'd burn massive amounts of money on electricity and get virtually nothing back. The ROI of throwing standard general purpose processing power at something highly specific like Bitcoin mining is hugely negative. To compete you need application specific integrated chips that do only one thing and one thing well.
But even in theory if Google was capable of doing that it would be better that they didn't. Large miners push Bitcoin further towards centralization. Especially when the miner is an organization that's beholden to various governments through laws. Just makes regulation more plausible.

I don't know if you're joking or not, but there's just so much noise now that I'm dead serious when I say a solid year of flatlining and just getting back to working on the technology would probably be better for everyone in the long run.

Anyone who knows who is brother is should have immediately realized that was the truth. People owe him more than a million beers collectively. He should be drinking for free for life at any Bitcoin event from here on out.
Even without his brother I would have believed him. He wouldn't throw that out there if he wasn't confident imo.

The thing is that even if 2x does manage to 'kill' Bitcoin by taking all the SHA256 hashrate, I suspect Bitcoin will just make an emergency PoW change if it's necessary and carry on. Annoying situation for sure, but I'd still support Bitcoin even with a new PoW. On the plus side we may have a slight chance of decentralizing mining again. That might be wishful thinking on my part though.
Companies and miners who are supporting this are seriously misguided, and that's putting it mildly to say the least. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:30:46
The Blockstream conspiracy has been completely laughable from day one. And the worst part about it is that pretty much all the arguments against Core are completely predicated on the silly idea that they are intentionally holding back on scaling Bitcoin to somehow profit off that. Which is of course ridiculous since Core has had a scaling roadmap that's been held back by miners and others since early 2016.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:46:51
Didn't they announce that Bitcoin was going to stay BTC but they reserve the right to reevaluate in the future? If hash rate is jumping around it's not like they'd immediately rename Bitcoin. It would have to be a bit of a process since it's a big deal.

Has even ever been a noteworthy contributor to Core? Maybe for BitcoinQT back in the day, sure. I remember he was the first person to get a salary from a private company to support work on QT. But from what I remember he drifted off into irrelevance quite a while ago.
And yeah he's definitely part of the 'do not trust' camp now. Oh well. I seriously hope he's getting paid a boat load of money for this since at least then we have the answer to 'why' someone would do what he's doing now.

The idea creating fair mining pools where people are awarded proportionally for their work is not a trivial one. Unless you happen to be Satoshi yourself, I don't understand your arrogant attitude and assumption that an interesting technical problem such as pooled mining was just so obvious. Especially when we have all of Satoshi's public communications recorded. Pooled mining was a complete game changer back in late 2010. It would have been something worth mentioning the the two+ years before.

It's seriously amazing how many supposed allies to Bitcoin end up becoming enemies. Either through their own malice, or their own ignorance.
Last few years, not just in Bitcoin but everywhere, I feel like I'm constantly getting the whole 'humans in general suck at critical thinking and rational decision making' hammered in to my head over and over again.
If Bitcoin can survive all of this and stand on its own then that's pretty good. But I honestly didn't expect the biggest threats to Bitcoin to constantly come from within the community. Definitely a learning experience.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:50:21

At the time everyone on every side thought segwit was amazing. Their only arguments were that it's 'vaporware' and that it wouldn't be done for years or something like that. 
Pretty funny to watch people change their tune once segwit was ready to go more or less on schedule. Suddenly segwit was the devil.

The NYA is a joke in general. But what's really interesting is that the result is various members of the community like Erik Voorhees and Barry Silbert revealing themselves as bad actors, and setting aflame years of built up reputation and credibility. All for nothing really.
It's just such an obviously bad idea that it boggles the mind why people other than Jihan are supporting this farce. At least with Jihan he's already established himself in the last year as the ultimate bad actor with his own ambitions and motivations. Why people do anything but fight back, let alone follow Jihan's plans and such since he's pretty transparent now really makes you wonder what is going on in their heads.

Bitcoin on the brink of bailing out the Bank of England?
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:18:11
It's kind of been obvious for a while that it would be in Bitcoin's best interest for that to happen. You'd take out a whole lot of bad actors in one sweep. One issue is all the innocents that get punished though. But still, if the community had the balls to protect itself in that dramatic fashion it would absolutely set a precedent going forward so that we'd never see the type of bullshit we've seen from miners the past couple of years again.
The existence of Bitmain's mining monopoly and the general mining centralization in China is unacceptable really in a project that aims to be decentralized. It shouldn't have been allowed to reach this point to begin with, but at least there's still a chance to save it.

I was around for XT and long before.
Gavin was only 'lead developer' to people who were clueless about Core. He had commit access at that time, but wasn't a major contributor by then. He was 'Chief Scientist' for the joke of an organization Bitcoin Foundation which by then was exposed as garbage  and carried no weight.
The sub was flooded with posts giving the illusion of support. Which is what spawned the moderation policy of this sub.
This actually has miner and business support. XT wasn't even close to 2x.

I think it's a bit deeper than just spite. Jihan has his own ambitions that involve increasing his already massive amount of centralized power within Bitcoin.

...token launch?  *(edit: After looking at their website it says there is no ico, so disregard this. I should have given them the benefit of the doubt. Apologies.)*
I've been a long time skeptic of 21's various paths but I always held a good deal of respect for them, specifically Balaji. So I'm pretty surprised to see that. 
Considering all the BTC they mined there at the start(they mined enough blocks to show up on the pie chart of miners for a while), and the fact that they raised over 100 mil already if I remember correctly I can't really imagine them being short on funds, even after 4 years. The BTC alone should be worth a ton now. That was always their one saving grace as a company, regardless of their products or services, one would assume they managed to obtain a good amount of BTC, and that alone should mean a decent balance sheet. Like in a way one might suspect that the start up was just a roundabout way for VCs to invest in Bitcoin without actually investing in BTC, which of course was a good idea in 2013.
I wonder what their burn rate is. Or perhaps they have lots of funds still but can't resist the easy money that's being handed out by the hoards.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:57:58
Nah man it's super simple single variable change and a one man job. Anyone who isn't willing to hard fork on short notice has no balls. Bitcoin is for real men who stay true to their word even if it means burning down their own business in the process. It's not about being reasonable or rational human beings, it's all about how we feel. And at the end of the day that's all that matters. Not the xx billion dollar project that everyone relies on being sound and stable. Fuck everyone else, we got the NYA!

Also ignore any private help for the short term as you will also be targeted by people trying to scam you. Do not give any of those alphanumeric strings to anyone as they could be private keys (particularly if they begin with '5').

The perception and/or reality that consensus changes can be solely dictated by a group of corporations that are by their nature beholden to governments. And the implications of that for that on the future of Bitcoin.
The idea that should a government or similarly powerful entity want to control or change something about Bitcoin, that there's no real group or individuals that can be compelled to do that is a powerful one. If this succeeds it weakens that idea immensely. Especially due to the very clear lack of consensus and massive push back by the community at large. Should 2x succeed it will result in a fundamentally different Bitcoin that defied some of the economic assumptions about what powerful actors would and would not do.
Also the fact that there's no dev team is ridiculous.

Yes, after seeing cdecker get his wallet drained for 9k btc on his linux box while literally doing his PhD research on Bitcoin, I knew that this was serious business.

Countless smart people have lost BTC one way or the other over the years. It's sad, but it's just how it is.

Highly doubt that. Core will continue on its own blockchain, not the 2x one. I have zero interest in a 2x style cryptocurrency, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who will absolutely not use or support 2x no matter what exchanges try to push it and what miners mine.
There's no tale-between-legs that's going to happen imo. For the most part people will either try to continue on following Core or they'll cash out and call Bitcoin a failed experiment if they don't want to continue the fight.

Don't a lot of ATMs require some KYC? And if not, there's not much chance they'll stay that way in a post 2x world.
Localbitcoins themselves instantly complied and shut down their services in Germany at some point. LBC is great, but many people here seem to think that it will stand tall as the last bastion of freedom should Bitcoin head down this dark road. But at the end of the day it's a company that has to comply with laws just like all the others. 
Also people getting arrested/fined for being an unregistered MSB trading on LBC has happened I believe. There's that, and then there's also more and more traders on LBC that are personally requiring KYC info as a condition to trade.

The impression I've gotten is that Segwit2x is claiming an 'economic majority' already which includes exchanges, which if they support the new 2x chain for real might not list the 'real' chain though, right?
Perhaps all these companies are going to wake up and realize that 2x is the beginning of the end some time before then though. But if not and they do actually list the two chains and a bunch of exchanges list them both that could be pretty interesting. 
I seriously hope that everyone knows by then that choosing 2x is truly abandoning Bitcoin as we know it, as well as Core and it's developers(has any major Core contributor at all even said that they'd develop for a 2x chain?).

And the stuff that does potentially make sense can just be administered by a legally registered company that can actively comply with local laws. Slock.it? Why? Why wouldn't Airbnb just integrate smart lock technology into their own business if it's legal and there's demand for it? 
It's not just smart contracts, but there's so much unnecessary 'decentralize all the things' that's been going on when there's absolutely no reason to. 
Billions of dollars of easy buzzword infused investor money flowing around creates a lot of bullshit. The only reason it happens is that below all the piles there's actually some sound technology that is interesting.
It's definitely a big industry with a lot of legit potential in things like gambling like you mentioned in the OP. But I'm quite certain we're not going to see some complete upheaval and replacement western law any time soon. Wishful thinking from a lot of deluded anarchists and libertarians. They thought the same thing about Bitcoin too, but 8 years later it's just being integrated into the banking system while people buy regulated offerings with their IRA and pay their taxes just the same. The law will just slowly adapt.

If Ethereum gets some legit cryptographically backed privacy with something like that then that would be an advantage yeah.
I think we were hoping that we'd see some Bitcoin sidechains with strong privacy, but that seems like a distant memory now that everyone's been wrapped up in the current issues.

Yes, so there's the meta issue with people trying to move nodes out of reach for regular users, and of course that's a big issue that has all kinds of implications. But I'm especially worried about that leading to companies trying to push things towards being forced to use something horrible like "sanctioned" SPV wallets with baked in KYC or something like that.
Funny how someone like Erik Voorhees supports 2x. He doesn't seem like a stupid person and at least publicly appears much more reasonable than most. And he runs a business that relies on a free and open Bitcoin. Plus his personal politics would suggest that he'd be highly against Bitcoin going down the path that 2x is going down. Yet he seems to either not understand or not care. Add in a bunch of other now wealthy Bitcoiners who apparently also don't care or don't understand and we get people yet again fucking up another system that in theory should be resistant to such things. 
It's probably going to go back to a cypherpunks vs the world type of situation again if people are so easily mislead and able to either unknowingly throw away their values, or knowingly do so because they think it'll make them more money. People always fuck up everything it seems. Even when the incentives should be obvious.

Honestly - at what point is it appropriate to call people who continue to support a string of the most obvious bullshit, stupid? 
In the last two years or so, there's been a subsection of the community who have consistently demonstrated a complete lack of logical reasoning skills. It's just becoming more and more absurd as time goes on.
The fact that Craig Wright is still scamming and being supported by people long after he was revealed to be a complete fraud is just alarming.
What do you even do when the community contains a substantial number of people who can't deduce truth from fiction? The fact that these people end up sapping millions of dollars of man hours from smart people who are otherwise trying to build world changing things on top of Bitcoin makes the situation not something that should just be laughed off imo.
Is this it? Are we going to be stuck in a war of attrition now forever because certain people like Roger Ver(the shining example of what I'm talking about) have presumably gotten wealthy enough through Bitcoin that they can continue funding stupidity indefinitely? I can't be the only one that's getting sick of this stuff becoming a permanent fixture in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:38:10
I value decentralization where it makes sense.
It makes sense with Bitcoin. But centralization is always going to be more efficient for any type of financial arrangement that doesn't completely rely on avoiding current regulations. Decentralization has a cost.
I think 'managing a spreadsheet' is oversimplifying the whole financial services industry just a bit.
 
Some countries do offer free government run banking as an option for people. And lots of countries all over the world already have it where anyone can send free instant interbank transfers anywhere domestically. With the healthcare comment I'm guessing you're American, and if that's true then I see where you're coming from since the US is a couple of decades behind in banking and many more decades behind in health care(unless you're rich or have some excellent insurance in which case it's quite good). 
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:46:19
Bitmain is definitely Bitcoin's biggest issue. But I'm praying that everyone who has been obstructing Core and their scaling plans just hard forks off and we all just move on with our lives on our own chains.
Out of all the crazy moves to try control Bitcoin, this one seems comparatively reasonable assuming they actually do leave BTC alone after they hard fork to a new chain.
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:39:50
Woah. That certainly sounds like BTC-E. 2011? Yup.
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:00:51
Except the US government insures your balances in actual banks so that this doesn't become an issue.
So the same saying can be used for people with money in the bank: Any money above the FDIC insured amount in the bank isn't yours. It's a loan to the bank. (and actually the whole amount is a loan to the bank, but let's just cut to the chase and talk about what you end up with at the end of the day once the insurance pays out)
You may have a legal claim to the money being 'yours', but that doesn't guarantee anything. But cash is like Bitcoin. Unless you actually hold it yourself, it's never really 'yours'. 
That's just common sense. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:38:51

Without Core I doubt people involved in 2x will push back against Bitmain's near monopoly on mining. Obviously the fact that they're willing to just wrap up segwit plus 2mb in three months that greatly implies they don't see a problem with the current mining centralization in China, since the higher we go on block sizes the slower those blocks are going to propagate outside China past the Great Firewall.
Maybe 2mb will be ok, but it's ridiculous to just commit to it before observing how the network handles the bigger blocks with segwit first. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:13:47
I think you overestimate how quick people are. 4 hours is pretty quick assuming this is what it is.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:00:42
Depends on what happens with 2x imo. 
But there should be a good chain with a new PoW that will probably still be worth something even in the worst case scenario.
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:21:08
Well, we don't know either way, right? What information do we have so far?
Supposedly coins thought to be BTC-e coin's were on the move shortly after things went down and such. So that might tilt the scale towards some BTC-e people trying to cover their tracks asap.
But either way, I don't know if people have a better chance getting them back if the gov does actually have coins, or BTC-e people still do. At this point the only incentive that BTC-e people have now to return coins is a moral one. Before one could argue that by running a profitable business, they had the economic incentive not to run off with the money. But now that they are firmly in the target sight of the US, that proposition is much different.
Someone could argue that they might be known by certain people who have the ability to harm them if they don't get their money back, which is a reasonable supposition for sure. But they could always just give such people their money back. Friends and enemies who pose an actual threat. Surely 99.9% or more of the user base poses zero threat to these wealthy Russians who given their line of work likely have their own connections and protection. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:54:49
Gox was way more mainstream and bigger and the timing was worse. 
Bitcoin Cash and Roger are very bullish since the closer we get to jettisoning that contingent from Bitcoin the quicker we can move on to a new era of building awesome tech focused on scaling in a decentralized manner. It won't solve the mining centralization issues, but at least people can begin to focus on that without being bogged down by the usual suspects constantly attacking.
I think the best case scenario is that Bitcoin Cash doesn't completely fail out the start gate so that people who really want to pursue that type of cryptocurrency can do so and let BTC be BTC. Although honestly I'm trying not to get my hopes up here given the track record of people who lean that way politically(in a Bitcoin sense).
SEC stuff doesn't seem too bad. Seems like more of an issue for Ethereum rather than Bitcoin. And at least if that ecosystem starts on BTC if/when smartcontracts or whatever happen, then people will have the knowledge of what they need to do to do it right and not get snagged by the SEC.

Isn't Monero also a public ledger, except the transactions are signed with ring signatures so it obfuscates the transaction by recording n transactions into the blockchain, where n is the amount mixins you choose for your transaction?
I could be wrong about that for sure. That's just how I think I remember it after seeing it a few years ago when Cryptonote was new tech and everyone was buzzing about a completely new cryptosystem.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:06:02
Is there even another exchange like BTC-E where you can go launder BTC to fiat and the other way around with little to no KYC/AML type stuff? I can only assume, and I think it's a pretty safe assumption, that massive amounts of stolen money and drug money has passed through there over the years. 
To Americans it's cybercrime. So I'm not surprised they'd call it that. Not that I like it.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:43:47
Hmm? Can you elaborate? What scenario is going to occur where there won't be a split or splits?
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:35:28
Whatever, but if any of these companies advocate for any change to Bitcoin that further removes privacy, or tries to integrate KYC, that's when we should riot.
I can totally see them using your argument here to try justify changes to Bitcoin in the future. Yeah, Bitcoin isn't very private to begin with, but for me that just means that it's even more important that we don't let it get any less private than it already is. Even outside of privacy issues, threatening fungibility is a huge issue too.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:41:54
Bitcoin is such a joke right now with all this bullshit. Segwit2x needs to go die off after segwit gets activated, those hard forkers for ABC or BCC or whatever it is need to go do that and forget about BTC, and then we can get back to some measure of sanity within the Bitcoin world.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:27:37
Localbitcoins is awesome, and since they don't hold money and such it's a completely different animal.

Or some further bs about terrorism or whatever.

Can you explain why you think this? Because that's not my impression at all. 
Infact part of the issue here is that it's simply not realistic to completely understand the entirety of such a complex issue, and why we should be weighing the value of the opinions of experts a lot higher than we do my own or any other regular Bitcoiner's opinion.
The only reason it seems people don't want to follow the expert opinion is that they believe they're intentionally lying for personal gain. But that seems highly unlikely to me. That or they just don't care about centralization because they disagree that decentralization is the primary basis of Bitcoin's value proposition.
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:22:56
Yes, as someone who is happy to see 'big blockers' go and give their ideas a shot on a new chain I find the amount of attention and seeming need to try to put BCC down very odd. 
It's like people are totally obsessed with BCC here. Why?
Why are people trying to be so negative when like you say people have been wanting people to stop the fighting with BTC forever? And finally we seem to have a solution that makes everyone happy. I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:16:21

Well, I'd say that's kind of accurate. Obviously segwit itself was made by Core. But this whole Segwit2x thing, with btc1 as the client is an attempt to fire Core and move away.
 
After segwit is fully activated everyone just needs to forget Segwit2x ever existed and move on and move forward with Core.
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:07:09
Ok but we're talking about drug dealers here. How many vendors were there on Alpha Bay anyway? I have no idea but let's say thousands at least. What percent of those are going to have the expertise to set up a remote server online on a VPS? And then of that group, they still have to be good enough to do that in a manner where they don't get busted. It's like you're requiring every seller to set up their own private darkmarket.
I don't know why the community over the years decided that Open Bazaar was going to be the future of illegal transactions online, but unless it's completely changed from the release the design of a public market where each vendor hosts their own server is literally the worst possible design I can imagine.
I don't know if the Open Bazaar designers deliberately mislead the community, or the community just created the mythology of OB on their own though.

1: It's a constant comedy of errors with that whole scene, so it just seems par for the course. This one is particularly confusing though, yeah. 
2: Yes, that's a big issue for sure and we're definitely going to be seeing some issues with that unfortunately. 
3: As you touch on there, lots of alts have tried to push the whole "Satoshi's Vision" spiel so they'll be in good company. It's already super aggressive and negative, but now they won't be able to blame Core/Theymos/Blockstream/Santa Claus ect. Plus, they've been saying things like the price is being suppressed and if there really were a 'big block' version of Bitcoin it would crush the so-called 'crippled' version. Sure they'll be making excuses for why that's not the case, but still it's another big 'L' for them and makes them even more irrelevant and they lose that argument when the market chooses the saner version of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:31:28
It will be funny if they use that excuse because personally I'm sick of the constant posts about BCC here. Like it's getting wayyyy too much attention here for some reason. Negative attention for sure, but people are way too excited about it.
Not to mention major exchanges and such sending out emails to their whole user base talking about Bitcoin Cash. The word is definitely out. Most people might be confused about what or why this BCC thing exists, but they've definitely heard about it by now.
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:48:56


It really is bullshit that people would try to write off incredibly valid and legitimate concerns about a single party "communist" state as racism.
If anything, the Bitcoin world is humbled and impressed by the complete domination of mining by China. But that doesn't make it any less of a problem.
If the situation were flipped and we had all the mining done in the US it would still be a similarly huge problem. Any sufficiently powerful government can make up some bullshit excuse like 'terrorism funding' or something equally ridiculous to justify their attempt to seize control. Which is why people need to refuse letting Bitcoin stay centralized in any country.

@_date: 2017-07-13 15:38:21
I'm talking about the implications of rejecting Core and giving power to Bitmain + various companies that if allowed will likely bend the protocol towards whatever they think makes them the most amount of money in the short term. Including things like KYC.
Also the fact that mining is already unacceptably cenralized in China and we already know that they're behind the Great Firewall. And we don't have any data from segwit to see just how the network is affected by larger blocks, but 2x is jumping into double the amount head first.

Nah. The people will fuck it up just like they do every other system on earth. 
At this point it's obvious. 98% of Bitcoin miners, the ones who are supposed to be the most economically vested in Bitcoin's interests, are signaling NYA. That says it all really. 
Between the centralization and the general stupidity of various parts of the Bitcoin community, the biggest mountains are yet to still be climbed. Bitcoin's biggest enemy is itself, the community.
Despsite all of this, the market is also equally clueless. So I'm sure we'll continue to make lots of money for a long time. Which I guess is what allows people to continue the delusions and such.
It's going to take some kind of revolution for Bitcoin to shed the emotion driven decision making and take some cold hard objective looks at what the limitations and relationships are between centralization and on chain scaling. Not sure it's going to happen any time soon though. People seem to be fine with trying to cash in today and throw away tomorrow. That's pretty par for the course though, so I don't think it's too surprising unfortunately.  
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:03:33
I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. 
I guarantee you that a massive amount of the people who support 2x have no idea what they're really getting themselves into here.
The lack of knowledge and absence of truth is probably the biggest issue driving this so-called 'debate'. People just don't get it and/or don't believe.
People who 'know what side their on' and are locked in to their opinion regardless of facts and truths are what makes democratic systems such a joke. As we can clearly see all over the world, but particularly recently. Bitcoin isn't a democracy, but I think it's pretty clear that the community suffers from similar issues.

Let's assume for a second that miners go full retard and say 90% of them hard fork. Without a PoW change or manual difficulty adjustment, couldn't the next up to 2016 blocks be confirmed incredibly slowly before difficulty naturally adjusts? Like potentially months of very slow blocks?
I've always just assumed that a PoW change was implied if all of the current miners really do jump off the cliff. Even just because Jihan will still be a legitimate attack threat. I could envision a scenario where the non-corporate Bitcoin on the chain we're on now is doing well and Jihan thinks that attacking it might help drive some of the value back to his abomination chain. It would be kind of futile I think, but would still be very disruptive. But if he gets desparate you never know what could happen.

@_date: 2017-07-24 21:07:57


Having this as some kind of law is one of the stupidest things I've seen. There are so many potential situations where mining can be corrupted(by governments for example) and following the longest chain can be the absolute worst decision you can make. 
The amount of apparent stupidity in Bitcoin is really staggering and makes me question the whole concept in general. It's worked well so far, but the last two years have been a constant shit show of people trying to drive it off a cliff. 
All anyone with a brain really has to do here is look back and see that there's a certain set of people in Bitcoin who have been consistently right, and another set that have been constantly wrong over the last two years. It's not a coincidence that the smartest people in Bitcoin, who have made it into what it is today, have a pretty good handle on how to steer the ship. And you'd think that the logical thing to do would be to give credit where credit is due, but instead we just get politics, obstruction, and drama.
You know it's really bad when you read that list of companies that apparently 'support' segwit2x. It's like they're from another planet where they've experienced a different history than the one we've seen on earth. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:34:03
Please tell that to the...(five minutes of trying to not sound like a complete asshole later) 'uninformed individuals and companies' that signed the NYA and thinking firing Core and hard forking in three months to 2MB is somehow wise. 
The btc1 project speaks for itself. When segwit is 100% locked in I hope people just pretent that the NYA never happened. It's so obvious that going with btc1 over Core is just a ridiculously bad idea. Like you have to be so clueless to do that, especially after we're going to have segwit already. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:12:03
Different crowd I guess. Bitcoiners aren't sitting here ready to throw money at the next bullshitter who comes along slinging tokens. But they managed to snag a new round of people that are apparently.
We already went through that on a smaller scale in 2011-2012ish with GLBSE. And that ended badly unsurprisingly. So decentralizing the token part of it doesn't really change much.

Great article. Thank you. In theory things like this should be ringing warning bells in many people's heads, but there are too many people that are so far gone that reality is irrelevant to them. It's very similar to what's going on in the US right now.
Bitcoin obviously doesn't scale on chain, and the people who insist that it can and should are just children who can't deal with the reality that they were mislead by people over the years who told them it was as simple as raising the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:44:39
They must know that if 2x ends up hardforking with an economic majority and the implied mining super majority, a lot of people are going to feel they have no other choice but to change the PoW in an attempt to salvage something resembling a free and open Bitcoin.

Shouldn't three months be coup  Why is BCC a coup? Sounds like they're trying to go off on their own and leave BTC alone for once.

People keep saying that with XThin but I've lost count of the amount of times I've seen it eviscerated by people who actually know what they're talking about when comparing it to Compact Blocks.
Not sure about FlexTrans compared to Segwit since I think that's more recent. If someone has a tl;dr of how they compare that would be nice.

This guy was rich af. Owned like 3 or 4 houses next door to each other and had multiple supercars apparently. I saw the houses, but not the cars. Read they were Lambos though.
If you mean rich corporation rather than just rich person then I agree though for sure.

If you don't like it dumping it is your best option to unequivocally state that.

Wow. This guy seems to really be the kingpin of the bitcoin money laundering world. He has his fingers in so many major hacks it looks like. I guess everyone always knew that BTC-e is where all that money went to anyway though, so I guess it's not too surprising. But to be honest I didn't expect them to be taking an active role in laundering - I thought they just turned a blind eye to everyone. 
That cdecker hack was the definitive 'if your coins aren't cold they can be lost no matter who you are' moment in Bitcoin history. A guy who at the time was a PhD candidate researching Bitcoin, using Linux, gets hacked for all his coins. Maybe you'd be safe if not using SSH, but still I think most people at the time and maybe a fair amount now feel completely secure on a Linux box, when you never know really as long as you're connected to the internet. 
If he could get even just a few mil back that would be pretty great. Can't really imagine it being particularly likely though.

Now that sounds more likely than the other stuff.
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:07:33
When you put it that way and consider the type of garbage people buy on there, you're right.

Where is that? That's particularly low. Lots of people in the world make $2-5 a day for various jobs and can live off of that. But $0.20 doesn't even buy a lot of rice or whatever other staple food people need to survive.

How is Bitcoin Cash an issue at all?
To me it's at best a good thing that people are going away, and at worst just a complete non-issue. 
Am I missing something here?

Why do you need to believe in some ideology to want to have more financial freedom and more options available to you?
I'd think that everyone from socialists, to anarchist capitalists would want that because it's all benefit and no downside to them as an individual.

If the economic majority supports this then it's over for a free and open decentralized Bitcoin.
I'm sure some people will try to keep a fork alive though. And it will probably have significant value as well since I'm sure a fair amount of people see that following 2x defeats the whole purpose of Bitcoin. A PoW change seems unavoidable though. I don't know where people are planning on finding enough SHA256 hashrate to slog through till the next difficulty change and not have it take months. Maybe I'm wrong on that though.

He probably wasn't told that he was going to be extradited and thought he would be spending the rest of his life in Thai prison. Or even if he knew, he didn't want to spend 20+ years in prison after living the high life.
It's not really that surprising when you think of it that way.
What motivation would the Thai police have for killing him? They're working directly with the US and Canadian police here. Having him die on their soil is a huge fuck up and a massive embarrassment.
If anything the one argument I could see someone making is that he paid them a million dollars or something to fake his death and release him to Cambodia or something. But that would take some serious coordination from top brass.
If they sent his body home, then obviously that didn't happen though. I assume that they'd ask for the body here. So that theory is a long shot too.

The Great Firewall seems like another massive centralization pressure that people seem to conveniently ignore.
It's utterly insane that in 2017 we're stilling dealing with retards after witnessing the shit shows that have been XT, Classic, BU, and now btc1. (and wtf is ABC? Hard forking in a couple of weeks? Jihan? Jesus.)
Core hasn't even been given a chance to scale Bitcoin. That's the saddest part of this whole thing. People are acting all crazy and desperate because they think Core is doing nothing. Yet they're the ones with the scaling roadmap and had the first step of that ready to go over a year ago. All blame should 100% be focused on miners who didn't signal for segwit and those who supported that.

On darknet markets though? Why? I don't remember hearing that it had any built in privacy or anything like that. Did that change?

Instamine scam. ~2 million coins was it?

I read it was 4 lambos, but whatever(which is incredibly stupid if true, especially with the current political situation and supercar tax crackdown). I said that to make my suggestion that he'd be someone able to drop a large bribe like a million to get out jail at least plausible(I think it's incredibly unlikely though). Sounds like he had somewhere in the 9 figure range based on what kind of numbers Alpha Bay did. Not earth shattering wealth, but easily enough to be rich enough to drop big enough bribes if and only if he had the right connections. 
Except this is a case where it's highly unlikely very many people, let alone a 26 old foreigner would be able to quash an investigation triggered by Americans. He would have needed to be tipped off very early probably by someone of high enough rank that they'd be privy to new information about international cases. Which is far beyond your local police captain who's drunk at the station collecting 500 baht at a time from people.
I know exactly what he would have needed and I'm not surprised he didn't have it. But especially with BTC's rise I'm pretty sure he had the money issue on lockdown. Even with money though it's not easy to build up those connections. He should have lived in Cambodia and he'd very likely still be a free man.

Really? That's surprising. That's a ridiculously good offer imo.

Are you predicting the Chinese government will decide to disable the Great Firewall sometime in the near future?
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:38:43
I don't think they are. Are there people claiming that it's different over in that land?
ICOs are much older than Ethereum. Various different names for the same thing have been used forever.
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:05:34
Probably some kind of scam.

Why does that increase demand rather than lower it?
