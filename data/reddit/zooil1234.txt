Really? The $1k is in CAD. What platform would you recommend me to use?
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:01:06
I see
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:02:32
I see
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:00:32
Okay. Even if the amount is $500-1k?
@_date: 2018-08-27 01:08:23
Coinbase is also Canadian, yes?
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:51:53
I see. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-08-26 02:39:53
I was hoping to ask someone who owns those
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:03:30
I see. What platform do you use or what platform do most Canadians use to buy those currencies?
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:50:26
Do you believe the price will go high in a few months?
@_date: 2018-08-27 01:07:48
I see
@_date: 2018-08-26 14:59:00
I see
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:33:33
Coin base? Are you in Canada?
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:45:53
I see. So it's a good idea to diversify them this way? 
Sorry but what do you mean exactly by the "bull run"? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:16:15
Ok. Are you in Canada?
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:33:12
If I have like $1k that I'm willing to throw into crypto?
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:15:53
If you knew what?
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:41:45
What if you were to just hold for 2-3 years?
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:48:56
I see.
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:40:58
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:01:59
By losing 70%, did you sell when the price was going down?
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:40:42
Okay. But do you think it's more reasonable to buy Bitcoin for $1k compared to ethereum or Litecoin? Or would it be more reasonable to divide that $1k into three and buy Bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin?
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:51:30
I see. By 200 you mean $200 right? Do you believe it has a strong future?
@_date: 2018-08-26 04:07:08
So you think Litecoin is a good idea?
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:46:58
No i mean what if I buy rn and hold for that time period? I'm not going to sell if it goes down but hope it goes high in that time frame?
@_date: 2018-08-26 04:06:53
Yup. Got it!
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:47:22
Why would I still be disappointed?
@_date: 2018-08-26 04:29:33
Ive watched videos online about it. Many people say that the risk is highly for cryptos but the reward could also be really high. You should invest what you can lose. I thought that if I invest an amount I can lose and if the coin does go up really high, what do I have to lose? I don't think this plan will make me disappointed at all.
