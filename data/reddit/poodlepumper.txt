Thanks for the tip! She agrees that it is the most important drug!  Currently she uses a Medipen vaporizer which cuts down her nausea and gets her to eat. She also doses with rick simpson oil...we are hoping it lives up to the hype!

Our service is the opposite of passive-aggressive. We are direct, friendly and informative.
For people who live and work in close quarters with others who have body odor, we provide an alternative solution. One that I am most definitely proud of.
