There was a recent episode of Let's Talk Bitcoin where the CEO of blockchain.info mentioned plans to launch a charity site (sharedcoin.com) I think? in Q1 2014.
It is supposed to be a platform for crowd-funded charities.

While I am not a security expert (and perhaps because of this reason) I do not and would not recommend keeping any sizeable amount of btc on a machine/device connected to the internet.
I would generate paper wallets on an offline machine and backup/encrypt those wallets.  If, for example, you use the blockchain.info mobile app, you can scan your cold addresses as "watch only" to check your balance and then keep a little bitcoin on your hot address for spending.

Not sure why you got down-voted.  People are losing real money on GOX and the lack of transparency, support, and communication are nothing short of criminal.
Taking a step back however, this is an important step in Bitcoin's turbulent history.  The "death" of Gox is absolutely necessary imo (or at least this iteration of the exchange) as Bitcoin sheds its training wheels in the coming years.

For as high tech as Japan is, it is surprising to some how cash-dependent their daily commerce is.

That's why I love crypto-currencies and Bitcoin in particular.  To have even a basic understanding of the economic implications, you have to fundamentally question definitions of "money vs currency", "intrinsic value", "hoarding vs saving", etc.
Another point of consideration when opponents mention deflation, is bitcoin is not in a closed-system (aka no geographic limitations).  Even if there were detrimental hoarding effects, the process could be slowed down and mitigate over a much longer time span.  We just don't know.

You keep going back to "bitcoin = fiat" which is erroneous as explained earlier.  
Bitcoin does have utility as decentralized protocol outside of its utility as a form of payment.  Obviously you don't see that value and so your relative value for the bitcoin protocol is zero.
I am sorry to hear you hold your shits in such low regard and I encourage you to continue refining what you think terms like "Intrinsic Value", "Fiat", "Currency" and "Money" truly mean.  I am not saying you don't know, but rather that they are discussions worth revisiting.    
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:06:21
Sorry bud.  I think you might have your fiat definition a little off and are therefore tripping up on the intrinsic value argument.  
This is a debate that often spirals into flame wars so I'll try to offer just a tip of the iceberg:
Fiat is declared by a govt to have value.  Intrinsic value is often used incorrectly when defining gold, bitcoin or other commodities.  At its core, intrinsic value is based on scarcity.  (ie floating in the Pacific Ocean, salt water has little intrinsic value, compared to if you were on the surface of Mars).

I really didn't want to comment on this but after reading Mr. Normand's report I felt compelled to.
**Myopic** sums it up best I feel.  His views on fiat currencies being a good store of value and thus qualifying as "money" are inaccurate.  His attempts to provide historical precedence fall short at providing any relevant contextual lens for analysis.
Taking a step back, it is important to understand what the purpose of any institutional research is or should be.  Research is typically provided to lay out a current state-of-play for a given company, market, FX, etc and provide insights and prognosis.  
While Mr. Normand does an adequate job comparing Bitcoin's volatility, market cap, and turnover to the USD and EUR, he ultimately fails in providing any future predictions on Bitcoin or the underlying technology, demonstrating a fundamental lack of understanding.
Even if his goal was to dismiss crypto-currencies as an immature fad, he did himself a disservice with this research.

@_date: 2014-01-09 04:57:31
I understand your frustration and sympathize for your predicament.  While exchange infrastructure will continue to improve and possibly make MtGox irrelevant to the future of Bitcoin, it is important to understand that the reason you are having such difficulty getting your fiat (USD I assume) is due to banks not being willing to do business with Bitcoin companies.  Bitcoin itself has nothing to do with your terrible delay in receiving funds.
If you assume that Bitcoin has a &gt;0% chance of not failing, then you have to assume that this will improve over time.

Concur on a the revaluation piece.  But we have to assume the funds on Gox are not representative of actual fiat inside the Bitcoin ecosystem.  
I believe (and I could be wrong) that this has largely been priced into existing exchanges.  IF Gox goes to near zero, we would of course see continued depressed prices on other exchanges as the news spreads.  But I believe the depressed prices would be minimal (~15%) and then settle.  
Coins created * indexed price of bitcoin (excluding Gox) already reflects a truer picture of the ecosystem.

Question for Andreas:
First off, I have really enjoyed watching your presentations as well as your time spent on LTB and appreciate your insight.  As you say, Bitcoin the technology and Bitcoin the price are separate entities and to truly understand where we are in the adoption/valuation cycle requires context.  
My question(s) to you is, how do you personally choose which variables and factors from information technologies, technology stocks, adoption cycles, and TCP/IP milestones to map out your "best guess" of Bitcoin's future for 2014/2015?  Which factors apply here and which ones fall short of the contextual framework?

As a potential investor I would expect a medium-high level business plan with 4-6 quarters revenue and cash flow projections.  Obvious value prop, environment risk, projections, etc.
You would also want to include estimated company valuation at time of share offering, % of company being offered, and then your dividend payment plan to include share buy-back/sell-offs.
If the dividends are attractive, you can even consider having the shares not signify any % ownership of the company.

Krugman is a good base to categorize fiat money.  As you stated, it needs to have an official status as a means of payment.  Bitcoin does not have this.  
Commodity money is a bit trickier admittedly since we are comparing something that is 5 years old, to coin institutions thousands of years old.  
One could argue that Bitcoin's intrinic value derives from its ability to agree on something without trust. (here me out).  While bitcoin as a currency is the first app, and its price is what everyone is eyeing, Bitcoin as a decentralized consensus ledger has in itself intrinsic value for the simple reason that there is nothing else like it in the world.  As advancements and protocols are made that value should increase over time.  
There are some interesting essays on intrinsic value (I don't have the links handy/at work) that discuss Intrinsic Value as a function of Utility, as well as a function of Scarcity.

I'm still in the discovery/learning phase regarding sidechains.  I'm pretty sure I understand the basics, but am less clear on implications from an economic standpoint.
For example:  If you "lock up" 100 BTC to create a PlatoCoin sidechain, are all my 100 million PlatoCoins pegged to the value of 100 BTC?  And does reducing the supply of BTC by 100 affect the fiat value of bitcoin?
Or am I fundamentally missing something?

I learned a few things from your post (FIRE) so, thanks.
Per your point regarding the Global Depression, I have been struggling with this issue and how I see it playing out.  While I think the initial reaction would be to adopt some form of a gold standard, I do not think the US has the necessary reserves to accomplish this.  While I am speaking from a US-centric viewpoint, I think the effects will be greatest on the reserve currency's domestic economy.  That being said, a country with such a large standing military in that situation could make some very unpopular decisions with the gold it currently holds for other countries...  
I know before the Revolutionary War, the colonies printed a fiat currency with no backing, that was printed at a rate commensurate with macro-economic output, but I do not know how such a system would be implemented in today's economy.
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:28:21
To be perfectly honest I am having a hard time figuring this one out so please help fill in any wholes in my logic or if I missed something:
On the one hand, the possibility of insolvency has existed for almost a week now (publicly debated on reddit, bitcoin talk, etc) and so is largely already priced in on other exchanges (assuming semi-rational investors). 
On the other hand, as you say, a significant portion of wealth would straight up disappear off the books if gox goes under. Investor sentiment would take a hit.  
I still do not see how that would drag other exchanges down to the 100's.  We still have ample liquidity and adequate price discovery mechanisms on the other exchanges.  We certainly wouldn't see any sort of rally, but, a crash?   I don't see it...

Sorry about what happened.
I use a combination of cold storage/off-line key generation (electrum/armory).  
For small ammounts (&lt;0.5 BTC) I use Blockchain with multiple passwords and 2FA.  It is important to close the loop and secure your email with 2FA as well so password recovery isn't exposed.  
Another option you can research is the new Trezor HD wallet.  I haven't used it yet but that is the next level of protection.

Andreas was rightfully critical of the Bitcoin Foundation's leadership (or lack there of) and flawed governance structure.  All foundation slamming aside, it is important to note that he is volunteering on a Bitcoin Foundation committee for reaching the impoverished unbanked.  
So, while the Foundation could implode at a later date, I think there is some merit to having Bitcoin Foundations/Alliances/Associations that advocate for the technology and its current/potential users.

There is a ton of merit in what you are saying.  I think with exponential technologies we have a really hard time understanding and grasping the rate of change to information technologies. 
Take a step back on the past 1, 2, 3, even 4 years and look at what obstacles Bitcoin has faced and overcome.  There are HUGE challenges ahead but, with a little time, human kinds short-sightedness smooths the curves of exponential growth.

One of my concerns about BTC over the next 5-7 years lies in BTC's similarities to gold.
Gold is a hedge against fiat (USD primarily).  So if the global economy sees its next marked growth period, commodities (including BTC) will face counter-cyclical pressures.
@_date: 2013-02-11 07:38:10
Intra-Day: $25 is a big psychological barrier.  Will see pressure to and arbitrage movements around $25 for next week or so.  
Short-Term (Less than a year):  Assuming no big negative news and shipment of ASICs - $45-55 by Jan
Long-Term (Greater than a year):  Lots of potential, but the governmental risks are high.  (ie What would happen if the US govt, prohibited US companies/vendors from accepting bitcoin?)

Money transfers will get faster over time.  Most banks are offering free/instant transfers to other customers of the same bank.  Ultimately, we have to assume the ACH will be "same-day" upgraded at some point in the near future.

The question to ask is, are we in the Feb/March 2013 cycle or the early April cycle?  The quicker the price goes parabolic, the more I am inclined to think the latter of the two.
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:01:06
It depends what "t" equals.  Today we have just under 12 millions bitcoin in circulation.  In 4 years we should have ~ 17.5 million.
So, if 70,000,000 people have bitcoin split evenly among them (not realistic), that would be 17,500,000/70,000,000 = 0.25 Bitcoin / person.
@ 1k USD btc wealth / person, BTC =~ $4,000.00 USD
Realize the above math is incredibly overly simplified.

Mining is great and thanks for strengthening the bitcoin network!  
It is important to note that, technically all 21 million coins were created at the genesis of the protocol.  Mining simply "unlocks" the coins at a predictable rate.

Western Union should incorporate Bitcoin into all its back-office payment systems.  If I were filipino for example, and I sent money every month to family overseas to the philippines, my family wont care too much about Bitcoin (right now).  But WU can give them the peso equivalent for the bitcoin I sent.  they already have the infrastructure and money transmitting licenses in place.
I'd also try and break into the digital micro-payments sector (think FTP gaming).  If they act with their eyes on the horizon they might still have a dog in this fight.

While your logic is sound, I am pretty certain that cancelling transactions on the blockchain (or any block chain transactions for that matter) are *not* considered to be transmitting money.
Bitcoin itself is still not considered actual "money".  If the foundation was running a service similar to coinbase or an exchange then they would fall under the legal definition of being a Money Transmitter.

Don't have time for a full reply (@ work):


FALSE.  While it can be difficult to track coins, the ledger is public.  IP addresses can correlate with wallets.  There are steps you can take to hide bitcoins (TOR/VPN/paperwallets) but most people don't.
Wallet security is a big issue right now.  2FA is key (at a minimum) and it does feel like the wild west bank robberies.  This will change.  When discussing bitcoin, solar, 3d-printing, etc people tend to look at it at face value (ie as a finished product).  This globalized, decentralized, digital reserve currency is an iterative process to say the least.
-Wallets **will** become more secure (hardware)
-Govt regulation **will** establish appropriate taxation and monitoring controls
-Fiat **will** continue to be devalued by their respective govt's over time

People need to take your line of thought and draw some intermediate conclusions from it.  
It is easy to get caught up on terms like stability when it all depends on what you are comparing BTC to.  We love talking about bitcoin's exponential growth and plotting it logarithmically.  **That** slope gradient is the tell tale IMO on where we will see Bitcoin "stabilize".

While they are both related to payments, I think it is a bit like comparing apples to oranges.  
There is a definite need to hedge pre-order risks with a service like paypal or credit cards.  There is also a definite need to be able to transfer wealth quickly and efficiently without cumbersome fees/delays.
IMO they both have a place in the market.  I will admit that Bitcoin's irreversible nature plays a bit on the side of irony here.  (I didn't downvote you btw).

To the best of my knowledge, bitcoin fees started as a way for users to help prioritize pending transactions in the blockchain.  This incentive to miners was always minimal and typically pegged to a USD rate of 5 cents or so.  If 1 BTC was worth orders of magnitude above its current value, the average "miner's fee" would be reduced via consensus among the major mining pools.
Lastly, from a long-term view, incentivizing mining is at the very core of Bitcoin's strength.  As time goes on and reward blocks are halved and halved and halved (every 4 years), miner's will be forced to rely more heavily on these fees to maintain a level of profitability.

The variables have been getting really interesting the past few days.  Old coins coming online to keep running buys in check (price stability).  Now this news with MtGox/Coinlab has the potential to open the flood gates to speculative money.
My original bet was Feb14 we would see 77-100USD/BTC.  It might still fall in that window but I think we could see another price doubling in March/April...(followed by quite a few bubbles).

You are required to claim on your tax form any profits you make in USD from buying/selling Bitcoin as a Capital Gains tax.

Yes and No.  With Bitcoin, the user takes on 100% of the risk.  Meanwhile, your banking assets/credit cards are insured and protected (up to a point of course).

@_date: 2013-10-31 01:09:35
All good questions that frankly require pretty indepth answers.  Here's a quick stab at a few of your questions: 
(Disclaimer: US-focused answers) 
Currently you are required to report any monetary gains (USD) on bitcoins that you make.  If you buy bitcoins for $180 and sell for $210 technically you should be reporting and paying capital gains tax on the $30 realized profit you've made.  The same is true if you bought sea shells, tulips, etc....Anything that you use in a trade and gain value on, is technically reportable.  If you buy and sell BTC on sites like coinbase.com, you have already validated your identity and can expect some reasonable chance of an audit some years down the road.
I'm not going to guess-timate on best case scenarios for the price of bitcoin but potential future values can be inferred from where you think the total market cap will reside.  We are sitting on ~2.3billion market cap at today's price.  If you think total bitcoin value should be 10 billion, then we "should" see $1,000/coin.  Doing your own research on where you think the technology is on the adoption cycle is critical here.
Stability is a tricky one.  Some factors that affect stability would include: liquidity, adoption rate, regulatory news, etc.  The current exchange infrastructure to support Bitcoin might be sufficient for a $2 billion economy, but probably not equipped to handle a $10 billion economy yet.  What I mean by this is having integrated options to short, futures, and quickly change fiat/BTC need to exist **internally** to all major exchanges.  These features would help reduce bid/ask spreads and reduce friction to market entry. Institutional money that is currently sitting on the sidelines will be an important factor to bitcoin's growth.  That said, they will not have overdue exposure to bitcoin unless the above are available, working, and fully integrated.  
While it is not feasible for a govt like the US's to "shut-down" bitcoin, there are decisive actions it can take to limit its legal use in the U.S. and most likely adversely affect the USD/BTC price.  Sweeping laws outlawing exchanges, merchant acceptance, and possession are some examples.  That said, I truly don't think we will see such laws enacted.  The long-term negative affects to isolating the U.S. market from the bitcoin economy would leave the U.S. lagging behind the EU &amp; China.  More likely, I think they will (slowly) create a comprehensive regulatory framework to enforce current KYC/AML rules, provide clearer taxation regulations on using/buying/spending virtual currencies, and possibly some restrictive capital control laws to "protect" the USD.  
I think there are something like 36 Altcoins currently out there, competing for Bitcoin's market share.  Bitcoin was the first, and there is an absolute First Mover Advantage when it comes to digital money.  Bitcoin's network affect is 4 years in the making and, at this time, no alternative crypto currency offers head-over-heels advantages to Bitcoin.  That said, if a new crypto-currency emerged that offered everything bitcoin does, and so much more, it could certainly compete with Bitcoin over the coming years.  (FYI there are a myriad of challenges alt coins face that Bitcoin had to endure as it grew)
There is a podcast that I listen to religiously that is published twice weekly and offers IMO the most uptodate and accurate information about this quickly changing landscape.  
[Let's Talk Bitcoin](
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:50:06
Not sure why you got down-voted...  A large part of bitcoin's success is derived from its first mover advantage.  Any financial instrument takes time to develop trust and bitcoin is still in it's infancy(read: experiment) phase as far as currencies go.  
The other crypto-currencies you see are newer and range in differentiation from bitcoin.  For another CC to surpass bitcoin it will have to incorporate a variety of enhancements, and spend years growing its confidence factor.

But that is not counterfeiting bitcoin - That is just scamming people with a fake "bank account" in a sense.
Ultimately if your question is, "Can bitcoin COMPLETELY replace a national currency TODAY?" the answer is of course no.  As it grows in popularity, its deflationary nature will be a pretty cool symbiotic relationship to fiat currencies' inflationary conditions.

@_date: 2013-10-24 05:01:05
The exciting monetary experiment that Bitcoin is becoming is, in my mind, staggering.  While we debate the resilience of a deflationary currency we have to consider that it is **digital** and **not in a vacuum**.  
Businesses can price their goods in USD/EUR/RMB and have real-time BTC price quotes to reflect the value in BTC.  Having the price confirmation, a worker is much less likely to feel slighted or to feel that his/her purchasing power is adversely impacted.  
The real irony perhaps is that Bitcoin's long-term success derives from standing on the shoulders of fiat.

It's a good question ninja.  
Shooting from the hip here:  Think eco-systems when you think of fiat valuation.  America is USD ecosystem, Europe = Euro ecosystem, and Playstation is PSN credits (I think), XBox is Xbox live credits, Amazon coins, etc.
The Internet of Things is beginning to see an eco-system developing for Bitcoin where capital for companies is raised in bitcoin, stocks are traded and valued in BTC, and tech goods compete in a free-market.
I do not foresee a day when BTC will be side by side with the USD on the value menu at McDonald's.  (though I could be wrong)

IAL (It's All Relative).  Bitcoin is gaining in value relative to other commodities and fiat currencies.  To determine if a national currency is inflationary you should compare it to other fiats, price of oil, gold, etc.  
I do not believe world currencies are about to go "belly up".  That said, inflation is a lont-term condition of floating currency.

@_date: 2013-04-23 00:52:26
While 1% of BB sales would represent a sizeable portion of bitcoins in existence, let's take a step back and look at it from a macro view.
We have to make the assumption that Best Buy sees more than transactional value for bitcoin.  There could be a first-mover advantage for a large retailer to accept bitcoin (if nothing else than from a PR standpoint).  
Along the PR/social media hype, BB could announce they had X million dollars in BTC-related sales.  Even a low % of total sales would seem big in the media's eyes.  
Also, assuming a company like bitpay can handle $10-30 million + in daily transaction clearing, the btc economy's size has marginal effect on sales.  
Last and minor point: If our target is Cyber Monday in December, we could potentially see a doubled in size (or more) btc economy to handle the holiday transaction traffic.

"FIAT", be it USD/EUR/RMB, is an imaginary game in which we are all willing participants and have bought "all in".  There is a reason China STILL buys greenbacks when $40 billion are popping out every month.

Dude, happened to me when I first started buying from them (Feb).  A quick email to them fixes it in a day, at the quoted price (70).  
While it is tough to buy from them and shit like this makes it frustrating, their customer service has responded back to me 100% of the time over the past 4 months. FYI I've emailed them 8-9 times overall.

My non-technical guestimation is a combination of past trends (not a guarantee of future trends) and psychological price ceilings.  
If I am correct in assuming that in a year's time we will have approx 13 million BTC's in circulation I think we will see prices between USD77-100.  The lower limit reflects a $1 billion market cap at 13million coins and the upper limit reflects a five-fold increase in value (mimicking this past year's performance).
I think both a) 1billion dollar market cap and b) $100/BTC are incredibly emotional drivers and ultimately depend on the increased utility of the currency.

This is great.  Thanks for posting!  My pie in the sky dream is to run a derivatives market (based on bitcoin) that allows prospectors to hedge asteroid mining operations....

I had a similar conversation with my brother.  I told him to decide how much per week (whether it be $100, $10, or $1) he is willing to "invest". And then to do just that via coinbase (easiest).  You can buy .25 Bitcoin (~$100) and watch it grow just as fast as you would 1 BTC.
The same is true for .1, .01, and .001 BTC....
FYI, 1 USD is worth approximately 267,000 Satoshis (.00000001 BTC = 1 satoshi)
Good luck!

Congrats!  I too have been paying for grad school (semester by semester) with Bitcoin.  It's kind of sad really...I basically put about 15k on a 0% APR credit card and every 5.5 months my bitcoin stash has appreciated/grown to where I can pretty much cover the entire thing.
Disclaimer: I just paid Jan 2014 semester today so the stash is starting fresh!

Anything at or below 30 is still fairly priced IMO.

Great work Isaac,
I too am a fan of the vertical bars denoting a "dollar symbol".
The horizontal bars work great for emphasizing speed of the transaction.  
Would you be able to play with the imagery in light of the latest Cyprus scare on Bitcoin being safe and secure?  (not a graphic designer or in marketing).
  
@_date: 2013-02-03 23:49:16
Great response.  Thank you very much!

Possibly.  But the resilience of the barrier (32) will not be as strong.

As an investor in a bitcoin-related startup, I would invest with fiat and hold coins.  As a start-up, I would want a portion of the seed funding in bitcoins as I expect the value to rise against the dollar (aka more cash to burn).
Very few investors would/have invested with bitcoin, especially during these bull runs.
@_date: 2013-05-16 07:33:26
5%-6% would be a winner in my book!
You could also price in "trusted" users (similar in a way to mtgox's reduced % fee the more trades you do).
Question:  How are you able to do this overseas?  Credit Card Only? 
Best of luck!    
@_date: 2013-06-11 05:31:55
Skeptical would be an understatement Sir...

Just ordered:) Thanks for the 15% discount!
FYI, when scanning the QR code, it added to "//" to the beginning of the address and I had to go in and delete.  Not sure if it was the Coinbase app or your check-out cart.

IMO you're right and you're wrong (love the name btw).  I would not expect BB to adopt bitcoin. 
As others mentioned, a large retailer would only even remotely consider accepting bitcoin if they used a service that hedged all the risk and instantly cleared btc funds to USD.  IF one exists that is able to handle the volume of BB, then we should look at other potential costs.
Best Buy, Home Depot, Victoria Secret all have their own credit cards if I'm not mistaken.  Their relationships with V/MC could be adversely impacted from a move to bitcoin.  Or not...
I mentioned the PR value earlier b/c I think that its something most people (including you) undervalue.  Before bitcoin, I wasn't familiar with companies like Wordpress.  While we all know who Best Buy is, their marketing profile could lend to staying "trendy" and relevant depending where bitcoin stands in the news come September/October.  (Can imagine a Geek Squad / BTC pairing).
The general public doesn't understand bitcoin (or care to at its current complexity).  With time, and more press coverage, the fear of the unknown will drop a little bit.  I'm not saying we all dance in the streets in our bitcoin banana hammocks - But I don't think it's too far fetched to see increased adoption from major players by the end of 2013.  
FYI, it looks like the Yen is about to get downgraded too (following the UK's downgrade).

They are 3 days late for me on crediting off my most recent sale (was supposed to clear on the 20th).  I imagine they are swamped right now.

You pretty much hit the nail on the head huh?

Currency Wars is a great read and incredibly informative.  I enjoyed the debate and agree with you - He could easily be "for" bitcoin given his arguments.

That's what I've been asking for!

Any luck with a formula?  I think this question popped into our heads at the same time...
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:56:58
I use   Lower volume and BTC price than MtGox but pretty reliable (if you can withstand the chat trolls).
@_date: 2013-02-19 04:54:35
That's pretty good too.  There is definitely a branding path to follow when it comes to "Money Evolved" and "Money 2.0".  Nice work.
