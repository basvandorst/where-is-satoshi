So about 6% of all multisig coins just got stolen right?
What's 13% of 13.8M coins? 2,053,015.25
and 120k stolen is 120,000 / 2053015.25= 5.845%

How is that multisig "protection" working out?

I wonder if the new cryptolawyers will displace the current batch of normal lawyers that occupy all levels of elected office in the USA?

Hoskinson says bitcoin users pay $3 usd per transaction.  He is mistaken.
1.  If you spend your coins, you can't pay "block reward tax" on the coins you no longer have.
2.  The cost of running the network used to be 1 guy, 1 cpu and 1 network connection.  If it stops being popular, it will return to that cost.
3. The "cost" of a transaction is massively changed by: A. full or empty block.  B. Market "price" of the block reward. C. The block reward goes down to 0 overtime.|
4. Your transaction, and its size, has roughly 0 effect on the "cost" of running the network.  The block reward will be paid every 10 minutes, barring network failure, whether you transact or not.
Hoskinson is a smart dude. In this case, he is mistaken/misleading.
TL;DR Bitcoin does not cost $3 a transaction.  Do not confuse people's desire to speculate/transact in a new currency driving up block reward usd value, with a fee.  The inflation in the system is not a fee.  It is inflation.

What %  of MtGox coins were "protected" by cold wallet?         
Please change the word "protected" to "use"
Because you use paint doesnt mean you are an artist.  Because you use multisig doesnt mean you are protected.

Can the secure use of multisig implantation be derived from p2sh utxo?  Nope.  For all you know half the people with coins in p2sh addresses have all the private keys on the same machine.  You do not know.  So do not claim "X coins secured by y method."  When you have no way to know how Y method is being implemented.

Look up the bitcointalk thread, where many large losses are documented.  Like the counterparty 2000+ burn.  You can also find unspendable btc in the chain.  So not "all" but many lost coins are known.

Charle's point was that the bitcoin network externalizes more costs for security, through proof of work, than other consensus mechanisms.  He also made the point that blockchains aren't useful in many cases, and are better served by other systems.  
Both of those are true.  As soon as the word "fee" is used, his point become inaccurate and misleading.
To your point about the "hash rate staying the same but there being no block reward"  That can exist in 2 cases.  Hard fork (then we are in lala land anyway.)  or far future (also lala land), both of these places are so different than today that speculation is either worthless, or if valuable, in a far different format than the questions we're looking at here.
Inflation is not a fee.  Stop calling inflation a fee.  You are going to get inflation whether you act or not.  If the inflation were a "fee" you could avoid it by not acting.

I understand multisig can be useful.  Do you understand it can be done wrong/harmful?
Thus calling any implementation of it "protection" is misleading and thus dangerous.  Doing multisig properly is NOT simple or obvious at all.  If it was Andreas wouldn't be able to sell for profit his consulting services on properly implementing it: 
Starts at $1000

There's no reason to assume using multisig gives you protection.  You could as easily be doubling your chances of losing a vital key.

So 2 of 2 m of n is great?  And you get 1 crypytolockered, You lose everything.   multisig, like passwords, is only as useful as the user is skilled.
