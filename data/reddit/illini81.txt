Are there no Mods? There is no verification with this. How the hell is this supposed to be a reputable forum if this trash can rise to the top.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:50:33
Is there no Mod to filter bull*hit like this? This is grasping for attention. There are no names/identities tied to this. The only details given are linked to speculative posts from other redditors.

But people aren't doing that for a reason. I think you're cutting this argument off before really figuring out why your hyperbole hasn't come to fruition, yet. There's more to it, IMHO

...but no one will use 2.0 because it has no support. The same principle is why people choose larger banks over smaller banks, their funds are more easily accessible and the odds of the business continuing is higher.

I'm following here, but I think you're undervaluing the network effect here. It's the reason why people find value in Facebook, or even the dollar. The US government doesn't have the amount of assets to properly back the total value of it's currency, the delta is made up by other user's faith/need of the network.

Streisand effect in coming! Can you hear it?
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:17:19


Totally understandable, but I do think that's a lazy way out. Networks haven't been properly analyzed and people aren't able to value them yet. This is going to be more and more common with the advent of globalization. My best friend and I have gone back and forth on this and haven't landed on anything beyond agreeing to disagree. I guess time will tell.

The difference is that one is happening and one isn't. It's weird, and as an Economics guy, i'd like to be on your side here, but there is a bubbling of understanding, globally, that is causing this increase. The most tangible piece of data that I can tie to it is the technological investment in ICOs, and new job postings by companies. People are investing time and resources to better the existing platform. The quote, "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted." is the best I can give you here.

Was in agreement until I saw the sub ��

it's unfortunate, but it's a real world play on all text-book lessons. We're seeing a story unfold that can be used to teach economics, both micro and macro, finance, international finance, psychology, behavioral psychology, investing, history, technology, and probably more. I'd call that as about as interesting as it gets.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:18:26
This whole thing is really fun to watch, it's like a capital market sandbox/simulation. I think we can learn a lot from the Bitcoin story, it shows a lot of the economic skeleton that all markets actually exist with. Even if we think it is different, it's usually just the same.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:21:05
i like that point of view. Humans are so irrational, at the very least, it keeps it interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:02:28
China is such an interesting beast. I have my theories on BTC, and most of the levers affecting the pricing, but I just can't wrap my head around China. Unfortunately, they'r probably the biggest variable right now, and coincedently, the biggest wild card. I'll stick glued to the news feed for now.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:45:20
No offense, as I am also in on BTC, but this isn't the most educated group of investors. It's a good place to get high-level info, aggregate news on the market, as well as bounce ideas off of people. I wouldn't be upset at the sentiment around the boards, there are people on here with all types of backgrounds, financial assets, and education levels. It's messing with the internet masses. Take it for what it's worth. It's fun and can be pretty informative if you weed through the junk.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:52:42
sing it sister. People throw their money in and talk bullishly about the idea, like they're trying to will the value up and up "to the moon!".
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:01:34
China didn't start the bubble, they inflated the price. The idea itself is strong, and there is a lot of backing from very influential people. This is a global idea, and we are in the beginning stages. You should be investing on principle and potential market cap, not speculating, in my opinion...

Coinbase "Bro'd" me out of 5 coins, at $1,800 profit when I sold. You're a lucky guy.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:02:40
...this was supposed to be inspirational. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:21:03
Good find! Thanks for passing it along.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:15:25
you're a very, very, early adopter of the trend. I would be patient. It's pretty cool that you guys moved your business to accept this. Who knows, you may lose out, but you could also be on the front of a tidal wave or revolution. You're essentially assuming the same risks as all of the "investors" out here. I hope it works out for you guys. I'm a freelance graphic artist, I should start working for BTC. I like the idea!
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:30:41
it does come off as a bit shady. apparently they have some pretty well known backers, which gives me confidence, however, after being yanked around twice, and being unable to contact anyone after those episodes, it's beginning to make me uncomfortable.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:16:49
This isn't an equity, it's a free-standing, unregulated market. You can point to housing, tech, or even those goofy tulips, but BTC thrives on its own, with the strongest infrastructure and quickest flow of communication in human existance. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:25:24
I think that, beyond calling it a bubble, it's a system that may stand up. I'm becoming more and more of a doubter everyday. I think that the recent $1,200 price point was a bubble, but long term, if the cryptocurrencys last, this bubble will solely be a ripple of tiddle wave proportions due to extreme sensitivity and volitility tied to how new the idea is. It's yet to be seen where it will go though.
Would you recommend that book?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:49:31
Everyone is in it for short-term gains. Let's be honest. If these people were here to invest, they wouldn't be shelling out life-savings, they'd be converting already invested assets. It's a fools market right now. Once the sheep flee, we'll see what this is really made of.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:51:41
Unfortunately it's a real problem. These people took a chance on something that had a lot of hype and probably took a big hit, around Christmas, too. Wall St. professionals were pulling the cord during the '08-'12 crash, these people have even less financial know-how. My prayers go out to these people, hopefully they realize that there is always a way to fix the situation.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:50:55
It's a play on the pyschology of the average BTC investor. It's not advice, to put it, "loosely".
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:09:40
You also can't win. You just die.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:06:16
I believe you should be posting on r/WouldYouLikeToPlayAGame. You sound like the character in "Saw"
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:22:18
IMO, all based on speculation and media attention. 99 out of 100 people who invest in BTC have no knowledge of investing, they just want to jump on board and make some money. The other guy, says he knows what he's doing, but it's too early to tell if he's telling the truth.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:03:36
I've heard that Bitstamp is a decent way to get in and out rather quickly, but I haven' done any research. I'd love to hear some good thoughts.

The author is the CEO of CoinBase. I would like to think that this article is a little slanted. Good find though.
