2 days ago, 29 November. The price dropped down to 1050 and then later to 1100. If you bought then you'd still be up.

Are these types of posts deleted by the mods? They really should be.  
 I am asking because this is the first time I've actually arrived early to such a post.

Please do not fill this subreddit with shit posts like this. Lets keep it serious.

he said in the thread he tried first with cashing out through Mt.Gox, but the delays made him concerned, so now he is selling his coins directly to people who wants to buy(investors).

Are you trying to send me on a trip to Belize?

I think he bought them for 72BTC and expected return is probably less than what he invested. These are barely economical right now, and soon the difficulty for mining is going to rise, and then these won't be economical at all.

just a link to downloading suspicious files and a luring title? seriously?  
I am not downloading that shit without any type of confirmation it isn't malware.

It's the internet, probably bullshit

wait what? if he said "I couldn't care less" he'd be lying tho, because as you pointed out, him taking the time to mention it means he does care at least some about it.  
  
So him saying "I could care less" is the correct thing to say.

Well. For me, when I was withdrawing my BTC, I first wrote the adress I wanted them send to, then I filled in the ammount(0.0005 less than what I had because of the fee). Then when I hit accept or what the button says, another box pops up in which I needed to write the code that they sent me.

I'm just gonna highjack this post and ask for help here.  
  
I added google authenticator to my account over at bitcoin-24.org and now I seriously don't understand what code is it I have to give them in order to log in.  
 At first I thought the code was gonna be texted to me, but that was only to verify I was creating a 2-step authenticator etc.  
Then I figured I needed to download the App for my android. But the code that one gives me doesn't work either.  
Then I tried the "applicationg specific password". But that was apparently only for my phone.  
Then I tried the backup codes, but they didn't work either.  
  
I think I have tried everything...  
Also on my google account where it says which sites have authorized access to my account there are **none**.

I managed to withdraw some BTC from MtGox 2 days ago. I think it took over 24 hours to confirm though, and the amount was below 0.3 BTC.
