It's not a crypto thing. In poker sometimes its a really common place to bluff so everyone would bluff there. Which makes it a perfect time to not  bluff, so no one would bluff there. Which makes it a good time to bluff. Leveling war.

Price volitility makes the value change mid sentence

Well the opposite of luck is skill and it seems weird to attribute those things to skill. You need to step back at look at expected value. I'm not sure if EV is on your side in this case. Always remember hindsight is 20/20

They probably all had the same bitcoins. Person 1 sold to 2 then 2 to 3 all the way to having 1000 people who at some time held onto what is now millions.

In 4 years btc gonna cross 20,000, for the second time.

Nah dude Wallstreet is leveling right now. Everyone knows what shorts are and that a dip comes after the spike. They're going to reap profit against all the people trying to sell and short btc
