Funny how it just happens to coincide with what BTC prices are doing... Market is about to readjust and drop: better pull BTC payment options to avoid losing potential profits. whats that? looks like its about to start gaining traction again? quickly restores option. 
Is it just me or is there an abnormally large number of "This is the reason why" in this industry that is only ever said after the fact or just prior to an obvious market trend? Even blind directional predictions can be right 50% of the time.
It became extremely obvious and much more frequent in the last month or so when every major currency was being shilled with fluff posts and specific reasons why it was going up but, a simple understanding of the currency pairs would explain the exact reason why most coins/Alts  were  going up... BTC had just peaked and would need to adjust... 
Sure, this doesn't apply to every example but it's something i notice more and more.

Yeah, how dare he do exactly what we all wanted everyone to do by spreading the gospel and leading the road to mass adoption. He excited about the possibilities?.... what a douche. Its not like all the new accounts in December made any real contribution to the value anyway... 
I think a lot of people commenting like this don't fully understand the interoffice gossip train that occurs when you say something in earshot of others that respond with nothing but negativity based on nothing more than what they read on FB. combine that with the large number of beady eyes popping up from behind cubical walls and all of a sudden, you are the BTC fan club Commander and Chief.

This.  A Reddit account with only 1 week of history as well... This is pure shilling designed to get you to hodl when the drop comes.

What definition of "crash" is that statement based on?

Serious questing, how is it NOT traded like a stock? People buy a share of it in hopes that it's value will increase, no? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:43:50
I'm confused by your statement. People buy it because they believe it will increase in value,  not because they believe it will increase in value,  is basically what you just said.

Ah,  I guess I understand stocks less than I thought. So, does a stocks value not have a connection between available shares and number of those being sold?

Sounds like these exchanges are going to be making a killing in fees tomorrow...

I think you are confused by what i said.  Your link only reaffirms my original statement.  
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:12:04
Thats not the question though. The outcome went your way but is still past tense (hindsight). 
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:35:23
 Tricky example. It's a complete sentence but not a logical statement.  It's like saying "I saw the things I will see". You can't REgret prior to the event or action.  The correct statement would be "I will regret the things I will do.

Hmm, you sound bitter. I apologize if my correcting your statement had negative effects on your emotions. I did not see it snowing outside. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:14:20
Isn't that the only way you can regret? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:43:39
We'll agree to disagree that vocabulary is a valuable discussion. I would point out however,  that I was merely addressing your comment and answering your question (?). Why ask if you don't want an answer?  
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:16:52
That would be a prediction of possible regret. It has not happened yet so you cannot say one way or another. once the situation has occurred, it can now be reflected on (past tense/hindsight). To foresee a possible negative outcome is not the same as regretting events that have already taken place.  
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:35:30
You did not actually regret it until After the event, not before.
