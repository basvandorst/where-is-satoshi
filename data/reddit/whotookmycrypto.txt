Was once wiping my rear end after taking a dump and the toilet tissue had "buy bitcoin" on it.
Karma please?
If enough people upvote I would submit proof.

So we should be betting on someone who continued to support a fraud even after it was exposed? This was his quote from the documentary:










Think the point here is that we shouldn’t blindly follow someone prominent, rich or famous cause they make mistakes too. And since we are talking about fraud on a Bitcoin subreddit, thought we should highlight our quick and easy [cryptocurrency security guides]( Stay safe.

You should watch the documentary. If what you are saying is true, it completely goes against what he is saying. Don't have the exact quote but it is something along the lines of we "bet on people who would put their lives into it". Pretty halarious.

Yeap there are many scams to be aware of when getting your hardware wallet. Examples:
1. Fake Trezor wallets
2. Fake Trezor bridge software and apps
3. Fake advertisements and websites
4. Fake Trezor customer support
5. Scams targeting other wallet users (eg. Ledger)

Don't just look out for SIM swapping scams. There are many other ways hackers / scammers can steal your crypto on your mobile phone.

Meanwhile in Indonesia, Bitcoin never sunk below IDR 10,000 even during the bear market.
