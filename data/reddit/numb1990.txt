I think I do unfortunately.. I'll mess around on the site more and see . Thanks for telling me how much it's worth, I thought it was more so I'm kind of relieved that I dont need to worry about it

They want this information in order for me to do that .. does it seem normal to do that for these kind of things as I know nothing about it ?

On reddit giveaways .. it seems legit as far as I know because folex coin has been written about in news articles on google  about cryptocoin or exchanges and markets ( the stuff I dont know about) . All I've been able to find out since I won it a couple weeks ago is  after I figured out the exchange rate of it to bit coin and then looking up the exchange rate to us it comes up at about 1200 dollars
