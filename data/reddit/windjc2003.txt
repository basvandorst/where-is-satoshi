People are not going to keep up with their bitcoin expenditures and the IRS isn't going to spend money on an expensive audit to try to find $5 here or $700 there that someone did not report from expenditures. 
This is much to do about nothing. 
And once people are spending bitcoins on a mass scale the IRS will amend the policy. 
Bitcoins as currency is so small fry to the IRS, they simply left this out. Ruling as property was the fastest, easiest and most relevant thing for them to do.

Well, until vilifying stops on both sides of the blocksize debate, then this dark time in bitcoins history will continue. 
So much vitriol (both blunt and subtle) being spilt everywhere, including this post and Hearn's. 
At some point the social contract of believing the best in each other and not the worst will have to come back to the forefront. Maybe reddit will never be a place for that. But if Bitcoin truly is "good" that nature of discourse will have to take place somewhere.

I know you are kinda still in denial about it, but the hard fork will be done by end of April at the latest, maybe end of March. So if SegWit is ready by then great! If not, it'll come after.

Who said they would sell their coins and quit? I keep hearing this, but  I have seen no direct quotes. If they do, then they are behaving as childish as Hearn did in his article yesterday.  If people aren't flexible, then they aren't going to make it as bitcoin devs. If a 2mb increase causes that, then they probably weren't right for this project anyway. 
Of course, reasonable people can change their minds. I think there is a decent chance Hearn himself will find his way back into the fold at some point in the distant future. We will see.

@_date: 2016-01-17 02:44:29
As a full time Bitcoin trader for two years, I honestly can't parse what your point is here. The market was primed to fall for technical reasons and its tension to do so was consummated by the news of Hearns very dramatic article. The market will have more uncertainty and doubt until this entire form is resolved. But in no way can price be used as a measurement for how much people like Core vs. Classic.
I hope you can accept 2mb + SegWit. And probably the removal of all RBF related changes until/if potential solutions develop actual real world problems.
Other than that I think most of the community and you share similar visions of where Bitcoin is going.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:04:48
What I am shocked by is that on github, Pieter is honestly saying he hasnt heard objections to RBF!?!  I believe him and so it completely shocks me! Because it means that the discussions for these things took place only on Github, not with merchants, miners, exchangers, or users of btc.  So the decision was made on 'technical merit' completely without discussion with the people making real world applications and uses.
@_date: 2016-03-08 23:34:08

Core has a huge PR problem. Maxwell is see as the "leader" but doesn't seem to communicate with anyone outside of Core. He also comes across as recalcitrant, whether he is or not. Then you Luke-Jr. posting bizarre extreme opinions, like today when he said NewEgg was the biggest economic player in the Eco system and the economic players decide consensus. Then you have Adam who has had very little positive to say about anyone outside of core and has made several seemingly condescending comments about Bitcoin as a whole. Then there is Peter Todd who is double spending Coinbase and announcing it to the world without consulting them first.
Core just comes across as cold callous and out of touch. Maybe they aren't. But look at Classic. It was started by one guy who took the time and energy to go across the world and talk to people/miners and ask them what they wanted. So simple. So human. And at its core, so effective.
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:17:42
Surprised this hasn't been censored. Michael Toomin is the brother of the main Classic dev not the dev himself. Did you make this mistake honestly or is this deliberate FUD?
@_date: 2016-01-25 08:32:08
Those aren't "mistakes" he made. Those are just your opinion. Adam and others in Core have supported 2-4-8. I doubt you would rush to say what mistakes they were/are making in their assessments. This is a great article and is very true all the way around. The fork is happening due to checks and balances. Core is the only one that can stop it, but if they don't invite a HF themselves and lead it, they have no one to blame but themselves.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:41:44
I dont think losing luke would in anyway damage bitcoin. Not that I want him to leave, but his opinions seem to be on the more extreme edge (perhaps one could say like Hearns). Casualties may be taken on the edge case opinions.
@_date: 2016-03-08 23:12:55
I particularly liked the part where you not-so-subtly let your epeen hang out in all our faces about how successful of a business man you are. More than most bitcoiners, I believe you said. Well, not more successful than this one I imagine. But of course, writing a self aggrandizing blog about how important you are shows how modest and behind the scenes you really are. Hold on, wha?...
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:03:26

So retail business owners that accept 0-confs are now 'kids on reddit?"
Of course devs with no understanding of whats happening on the retail side of bitcoin are not going to object. They dont have the knowledge or expertise or insight to object.
It is the devs job to show the community why it helps the eco-system grow, not the eco-system having to convince the devs not to hurt it.
@_date: 2016-01-24 06:12:40
There should be debate and discussion about this. 
And why is this 20% downvoted?
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:02:02
Greg, the more important question is one of communication. You are losing this battle because of a failure to listen and compromise. Are you going to take your lunch box and go home just like Hearn did if you don't get exactly your way or are you going to acknowledge - as he did not - that some of your ideas are not what the community wants at this time and work with Classic? Core will not be excluded at all. The only person that can exclude you is you. 
Please learn to be humble and communicate. That is all that is asked going forward. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:45:13
Look it's not a problem right now in the real world eco system. So it's not a problem that needs to be solved. Bitcoin is not just a tech, it's a world wide community of humans interacting. Sorry that that may not be your expertise. Tech is not my expertise. But that does not make you the smartest person in the room.
RBF will be removed by Classic. If people start to manipulate the system, of course we can add it later.

Well Maxwell said he wouldnt work on Bip101. He hasn't commented on Classic. But if he left it would be as childish as Hearn's departure. There is a clear way to work together and work with respect. Devs have to respect acknowledge and work to accommodate what the super majority of the eco system wants. I have faith that Maxwell gets this.
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:09:14
Its called compromise. I respect Gavin's willingness to be wrong and to take input and to value several opinions in the eco-system. 
Like it or not, you are right now not perceived as flexible or willing to compromise. These are qualities that you may not find important, but they are. Especially if you want to lead a team of developers for this project. You cannot code in a vacuum. I mean you can, but things may move in directions you would rather them not.
@_date: 2016-03-08 17:32:26
It's amazing that these type of points haven't been addressed. I completely agree with you that no one that I know of has publically talked about how lightening will allow people to make a one click low cost (low enough for micro transactions) one time rapid transaction from a wallet.

I fear you are being incredibly naive. I think at end of the three weeks you will find no clarity on a blocksize increase. I also spoke directly with  from Bitfury. He said the same as you - Core should give an answer for a blocksize increase or the people on the list will move to Classic. 
The thing is you are being dupped in my opinion. For one, it was never Classic vs. Core as far as devs go. While a few noisy pro-Classic redditors talked about getting rid of Core completely, no sane person in our eco-system thought that was a good idea. This idea is lunacy. But that is what you are being "sold".
Second, I don't think Core is going to give you ANY clarity that you want. I hope I am wrong. But you are going to be feeling rather stupid if it comes down this way I fear.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:24:56
I'm not annoyed. But I think most readers can see what emotions drive you. If they choose to follow fear, that's their choice. In my experience, those who wrap themselves up in the fears of others don't normally get to any place they are wanting to be.

Please explain what you mean by your opinion that it could "plummet to a fraction of the price". Do you mean 4/5ths of the price, 3/4ths of the price? What do you mean exactly?
Its also conceivable that Amazon could plummet 4/5ths of its price one day.  There are always external forces we can't control.
I hope you don't mean like 95/100ths of the price. Because at this point, that is just not supported by any fundamentals or technicals.
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:12:57
This is about power.  Current devs want to keep the power structure the way it is. Miners want to show they have the power to implement decisions too.  Miners hold most of the cards and this reddit makes it seem like people are in protest. Some noisy ones on this reddit are, but overall, most people don't care.  Some current devs might quit, but its unlikely. They like to bluff and stuff.

The future is unknown. That is what you use to justify your fears. Ok. But I don't choose to share your fears and I've made millions outside of bitcoin with various businesses and investments. And others don't need to hear your fears. They can research for as long as they feel comfortable and make a decision. The world doesn't need people to save it from Bitcoin.

Exactly.  BTC2X will be a fraction of the legacy's chain price. Therefore, even if the BTC2X has 85% of the hash power, there is NO WAY IN THE WORLD any exchange is going to call the cheap priced coin BTC. Not unless they want traders to abandon their platform.
Meanwhile, if 85% of the miners leave initially then the legacy chain will be slow, meaning that no one will be able to send coins to exchanges to dump. The 2x chain will be fast, so people will be able to send those coins to the exchanges to dump. 
How long will the miners mine at a 80% loss??? This is the question. How much money do the miners want to lose trying to bend the markets will to 2x?
I doubt they will mine 2x for very long.

You have a very specific personal opinion about what "great" is.  That doesn't make your opinion true or right. No one can have enough knowledge to consider the scope of what "great" could be because there are many different visions of what can be built on or around the bitcoin protocol. There are certainly many people that want to develop products around bitcoin that many would consider "great" that can't do so at the moment. Some would argue that a lack of general capacity for innovation is something far less than "great".

Not from a collector's standpoint. Although choosing the engraving option over the non-engraving option will undoubtably lower the value over time.

They did not lead rally in 2011.
They did not lead rally in April to 266.
They did not lead rally after silk road dip.
They did not lead rally at $200.
They DID lead rally around $250-$900 on first parabolic rise.
They have NOT led the market since, except for the day the news broke in China about the government guidelines.
In a nutshell, Bitcoin doesn't need China. They can hop off the train if they like, its not going to matter.
