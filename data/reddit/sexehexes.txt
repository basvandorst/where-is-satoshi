hahahahaha more like a 15ft yacht what are you smoking, for one of the big boys, you need 100m+ to be chump change.
A yacht costs roughly 10% of its value annually just to keep running. 
If it flies, floats or fucks - rent.

it's a lot more then 'an extra few k', try an extra few bitcoins.

You keep conflating concepts (like ownership) with physical things.... like cars or bottles of water... Physical objects have intrinsic value whether you believe it or not thats kind of the whole point of this discussion. Just because you dont see any real value in a lump of metal it has a use because it exists. Bitcoins physically exists of course (in the form of magnetic fluctuation on harddrives around the world) but the utility is way lower without trust or belief etc...

that wont happen for a while, we're at 1% irate which is historically nothing. Earnings are still being revised up and the $ is looking to gain strength over the next year as irates go up. 
This means there is a strong argument for pretty continual growth in the US market for now. 
Bitcoin on the other hand is totally speculative!

the fact that you can infinitely divide bitcoin also doesnt lend well to the scarce resource = prices rise argument.
Also why do you tie bitcoin value to blockchain? What do you think will happen when companies like credit suisse start implementing blockchain solutions to internal company mechanics (not including great big cross national blockchains for whatever things like uber) to bitcoin prices? 
Right now the only real way to get exposure to decentralised revolution is basically buying cryptos; once blockchain starts seeing mainstream usage people wanting to invest in the revolution will not just have bitcoin as an option anymore. 
You will see, in the end bitcoin will be disrupted by blockchain.

People here don't fully understand how investments and currencies work here, too much ideological thinking!

only until the rules are changed ... It's infinitely dividable.

No there is no trust, cars are made of materials, materials have intrinsic value. I was just explaining how things have less risk then 100% when there is some utility not just accepted value.

If you buy a cars to rent out as a business; and the business goes bad, you still have assets on your books. Bitcoin doesn't have that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:58:12
but who is in charge? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:18:16
How does a credit system in a bitcoin based currency/economy work?? Can a couple mortgage their house in order to finance an investment through a bitcoinn system?? I am having trouble answering this type of question!
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:31:43
thats not how volatility works; youre describing a trend.
Also where is this 40% decline coming from?  
what i can see non-inflation adjusted price is like 11x or something over 40 years...

damn, just as I was beginning to feel less old, I remember I had Wild wild west on dvd haha!
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:17:12
Correct me if i'm wrong but cant you just add some decimals in order to change the value of a satoshi, i.e. you can continue to break up bitcoin into smaller and smaller pieces ad infinitum?? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:45:37
It’s got nothing to do with belief in value - you need to learn about utility. Bitcoin has utility because other people believe it does. A car has utility because you can use it. You can’t sit on a bitcoin or sleep in it or use it for transport.

not even enough to rent a semi decent house for a week in a relatively nice area (porto ercole, spetses, not including south of france hotspots im afraid)
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:55:12
But why would you deposit BTC with a bank? What is in it for you? There is no interest rate with BTC right?? Banks would have to offer something no?

Something tells me you have not got much experience running a business as anyone who does can tell you how vital loans are to the economy; unless someone can tell me how the loan system will be replaced, I only see bitcoin as a potential competitor to gold, not the USD.
