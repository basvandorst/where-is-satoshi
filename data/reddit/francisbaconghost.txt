the same number of buys and sells are happening at all times

were you around here, say, 3 years ago? those adoption efforts clearly failed / were way over optimistic.

so you should start the clock at the first smartphone not the first phone... which would be like 1995ish and we get the first iPhone in 2007. Before that though the blackberry/winmo/palm treo were omnipresent. 
Basically this happened as soon as technology allowed for it.

that's some serious revisionist history. the public realized mobile phones were valuable waaay before then. are you old enough to remember "car phones"?
first commercially available handheld cell phone was 1983. i had daily interactions with one a decade later. and technological progress is supposed to be faster today.

day traders don't seek diversification. you missed my point.

yeah adoption is obviously non-zero. among criminals adoption exists (though they are moving to more anonymous currencies with lower txn fees). among gamblers there's adoption because they can get their fix without looking like low lifes. there just isn't...you know... real world usage by normal people

well the smaller alts have lower volume so more tracking error. if you want more leverage just use leverage. or just go to vegas.

right. the only adoption bitcoin has is in trading/speculation.
@_date: 2018-06-13 04:53:16
bitcoin is like 10y old?
@_date: 2018-06-13 04:42:33
shhhh. dont tell anyone
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:09:17
it doesn't have wide adoption. i think it's pretty clear what it means
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:31:13
i love the people that invest in multiple different cryptos. charts like this show that there's no diversification to be had.

is just an idiot
