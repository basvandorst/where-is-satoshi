So what? No one uses bitcoin for payments anyway, no one is ready to wait for 10+ hours and pay 20$+ transaction fees.

All I am trying to say is: Russians decided not to use bitcoin, don't they have such a right? Aren't they free to choose what to do inside their own country? When you say "Fuck you Russia, because you don't want to use bitcoin" you sound like a vegan pissed off by someone eating meat.
It would make some sense if GekkoPie said something like "fuck russian goverment for prohibiting bitcoin for russians", but he said what he said.
And yes, I live in Russia. [Right here]( And we have a democracy, in a way that most of our citizens are actually supporting the goverment they have and the way of living they have.

At least voters dont protest against this prohibiton. They swallow it. They don't protest, they are ok with that prohibition and with the goverment that issued it. So in a way policies are actually representative of the voters.
But I wanted to say something different.
@_date: 2014-10-03 18:56:12
this is the choice of russian goverment, which was elected and is supported by russian people. Isn't that how democracy works? Are russians not free to choose what they want to use and what they prohibit? Are they prohibiting the use of bitcoin for other countries? And how exactly does this deal with your interests? Were you planning a trip to Russia where you was going to spend some bitcoins?

If there is a problem for chineese to get money out of their country why don't they use their last opportunity to buy bitcoin before the ban, why are they selling?
I mean, owning bitcoins for chineese means owning money that is not controlled by chineese goverment and can be easily moved abroad.

Today everything about Russia is actually about resources, treasures of the soil. Putin and company hold control of the resources and they get enormous profits from selling them. Russian people are fucked, they get a share of that money enough only to sustain miserable existance. Most profits are going into putin and co pockets. People brains are washed by TV and other media to worship putin.
Russian goverment has no plans to bring the world under their control. All they care about - is to keep USA an Europe away from their resource feeder. And it is obvious that USA is trying to get its hands to every resourceful country, destabilise it and gain control over the resources.
Aleksander Dugin is a shithead, working for putin and co.

I ill leave my 2 cents here, no one is going to read it anyway.
I think Mark manipulated the market but he was after a much higher price, maybe around 4000$. Maybe at about $4k price he would have started a selling bot.
Buying BTC with fake dollars for Mark meant making debts before people who were selling, because he would have had to pay them back with BTC when they would have wanted to buy back. But if he could sell at the peak, he could cover the debts with less BTC due to a very high price.
And then all of a sudden China "banned" bitcoin which triggered panic sell, not planned by Mark, because users started massive sellings, not Mark, which made him pay people back with BTC that he did not actually have, that's why he had to halt the BTC withdrawals.
That's only speculation, I really have no evidence, but I think this can fit in the facts we have.
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:10:27
wow. why do you take that ban so personally? russian goverment which was elected by russian citizens prohibits bitcoin use for russian citizens and they seem to be perfectly ok with that. what the fuck is your buisiness in here?

You may be right, and I think you most probably are, but there are concepts which are very hard to decompose to raw sensations, and I think there might me ones impossible to decompose. There may be concepts that are lying outside the sphere of words interconnected by mutual explanation and with physical sensations in the center of the sphere.
Also, the process of decomposition to raw sensations is very subjective, and results may vary when processed by different individuals.
When talking about precise definitions a sophistry argument can be found. Can I precisely define the rock I am holding in my hand in front of another person? If I say "The rock I am holding right in front of you in my hand this very moment as I speak", will it be precisely enough described? We know now that every second through every centimeter of our space millions of neutrinos do flow. Did we mean the rock with neutrinos flowing through it at the moment or without? The duration of speech was several seconds, during this time some elementary particles of the rock itself could emerge from it, or the wind could move some sand away from the rock, or some molecules inside the rock could transform.
Of course clarity of communication is not the lost case,




I just wanted to draw attention to the fact that proper definition, especially of such complicated concepts as 'virtual', can turn out to be a philosophical problem.

They tie them through the exchange. When dollar inflates BTC/USD exchange rate will change on the exchange, and bitcoin will cost more dollars, so bitcoin buying capacity will not change, but dollars buying capacity will decrease.

Who the fuck cares about the price? Traders? So is this a trading community now?
Bitcoin is going to work with any price that is above zero. If the price goes to 0.1$ it will still be capable of transmitting value. Why the fuck are we even concerned about the price? Aren't we supposed to be concerned of other things like usability, safety of use, core developement and things like that?

if something that once cost $250 now costs $300 for you, bitcoin will cost 20% more in $ for you as well

@_date: 2015-01-25 10:08:02
Well, having a precise definition that cannot be expressed with words is something of course, but can something like this be proved to exist?
Even the language of mathematical notations cannot express definitions precisely, because it is not exhaustive and lacks the definitions of some initial concepts.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:19:15
No, I am not.
You were saying:




In my example the cost of burger rised from 1$ to 2$, but it didn't cost more in BTC, it was 1BTC for a burger both in EU and US and it stayed 1 BTC for a burger.
you are just trolling now, so conversation is over
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:33:22
The question is - can anything be properly defined at all, and can anything be entirely understanded?
I mean, while defining something, you use words that require definitions themself, and we can fall into a very deep pit here of linguistic philosophy and philosophy of language.

What do you mean by "tied"? In soviet Russia there were times when ruble was tied to US dollar for USSR citizens. That means there was no free market for citizens, and the only exchange there was - USSR goverment. Which said "from now on I exchange 1 $ for 4 rubles for USSR citizens, and yet you gonna get peermission to buy $ first". This is what I understand by "tied". But we are talking about free markets, aren't we?


I don't get the point of this. Almost all countries except maybe Japan have inflation, so almost all products are created in countries with inflating currencies. So how does this influence bitcoin?
Let's imagine you live in Japan during the time of deflation (the process opposite to inflation), today you can buy 10$ for 100 yens (for example, I don't know the course). Also today in Japan you can buy a burger for 100 yens, and you can buy one for 10$ in the US. Tomorrow US goverment will print lots of dollars, Japan won't, and tomorrow you will buy 11$ for 100 yens, you will also buy a burger in Japan tomorrow for 100 yens, but it will cost you $11 in the US.


This the root of your misunderstanding. If EU starts massively printing euro, the value of euro will decrease, but the value of $ will not. Same with bitcoin.


Again, this is a question of understanding the term "ties". Is gold tied to fiat markets? If USA starts printing tons of dollars, the price of gold in dollars will increase. What will happen with the price of gold in euros? People will think that if USA gone insane maybe EU will go insane too and will start printing euros too. So they will start buying gold for euros too, so the price of gold in euros will increase. Are you talking about this kind of ties?
You know, in modern world of finance everything is interconnected, so you cannot say that something has zero ties to fiat markets. My fart is tied to fiat markets, because if ruble gains value against dollar I will be able to buy more imported fruits for my rubles and my fart will be more fruit flawored.
I suggest you do some reading on wiki about inflation.

wow! thanks! Remineded me of the first tip I've got in my life (and the only one until today) while working in the US. A truck driver, who came every morning to drink his pot of coffee and smoke half pack of cigarettess found out I was from another country, came to me and put $20 on the table. "Here" - he said "For you, welcome to America".

*the cost of goods and materials is still tied to fiat
Inflation affects the cost of goods and cost of living whether you hold bitcoins, dollars, or monopoly bucks.*
You are kinda wrong here, dude.
If goverment issues more dollars, there will be more dollars in circulation, but the number of goods available for buying will be the same. Which will lead to reduce of dollar buying capacity, or the rise of prices nominated in dollars. But the amount of monopoly bucks wont change, so prices nominated in monopoly bucks will be the same. This is what inflation all about.

The default was due to a ponzi scheme set up by russian goverment in goverment bonds. Annual yelds on russian goverment bonds was if I remember about 140 - 170%. It was clear to everybody with half a brain that you can get 170% on coupons only in a ponzi cheme. And that it can't last forever. But investors wanted to gamble. People never change. Thay are always greedy and willing to take risk.
But our goverment is very good at inventing new methods of keeping foreing investors away from our economics. In 2014 they didn't set up a ponzi, they started a war. Well, a good way to ruin economical ties too.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:12:08
No. Because russian ruble has zero chances of growing in price. It actually has never grew up, it always got cheaper and cheaper. The course is not 66 R for 1 $ it is 66 000 R for 1 $ because in Russia we had denomination. And it was 1 R for 1 $ once. Ruble has no bottom. It will freely fall to the center of earth, having a denomitation after denomination.

*but im in a rush
oh boy, I was stoned indeed.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:58:46
oh man...
Let's get it as simple as possible.
1 burger cost you today 1$ or 1 euro or 1 BTC
this means 1$ = 1euro = 1BTC
USA prints dollars, 1 burger costs 2$ but is still 1 euro, because EU didn't print money.
so 1$ = 0.5 euro = 0.5 burger
now, what about bitcoin?
People in EU wake up, check the euro supply, understand that it hasn't changed, go out and buy a burger for 1 euro. Then they scratch their ass, sit down behind a laptop and go to european exchange to buy some bitcoins. What will the price of 1 BTC be? Right, 1 euro. Why? Because european geeks don't give a shit about US printing money. Nothing changed for them since yesturday.
But european forex trades first read a newspaper which tells that US printed lots of dollars. So they go on forex and trade 1 euro for 2 $. So what will the cross-course of BTC - USD be? Rigth? BTC = 2$.
because TODAY: 1 euro = 1 btc = 1 $ = 1 burger
TOMORROW: 1 euro = 1 burger = 1 BTC = 2 $

How exactly does it work?
If I want to sell a bunch of bitcoin at market price and find, say, 100 buyers that together have enough asks to cover my amount, will I have to manually send bitcoin to every one of them?
Or do I first send bitcoin to you, so you distribute them among the buyers? Or do I use some software of yours, that handles the transactions automatically? In this case you will be in control of my bitcoins for some time. Or is there a multisig thing implemented, like you prepare all the transactions and I just have to sign them all with a single button hit?

Why not just sell people something like a "full node kit" with a 1-2-3 setup instruction. Maybe based on a Raspberrypi or something like that.
