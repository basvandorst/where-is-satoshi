Perhaps. But if so I don't think the idealists are to blame for that, the majority of people is!
And yes, a cryptocurreny's rules are harder to change as the community and network grows. But that's not the fault of Core devs! (I personally even think that the fact it's hard to change Bitcoin's rules is a great benefit, and a key value proposition.)

Why is 2MB reasonably practical, and why are other sizes not? Why not 4MB? Or 8MB? Or 1.1MB?
Should they also release a version with a 22 million coin limit? Should they also release a version with 5 minute block time? One with X11 POW? If not, why aren't these reasonably practical?

True story.
@_date: 2016-08-16 10:32:34


Developers are not in charge of hard forks, as users can simply refuse to upgrade to whatever software developers release. See Ethereum Classic.
You need to persuade the community. And the *whole* community if you don't want a coinsplit.
@_date: 2016-08-17 09:41:47


Reject the (according to users) invalid blocks that miners mine. As a result, miners would be mining worthless blocks with worthless block rewards, and have to quickly switch back to whichever chain users consider valid. (Or go out of business.)


No that at all, that's one of the great things about Bitcoin! :)
It has even happened before, last time was [July 2015]( This wasn't a political disagreement, but the effect was the same. Miners mined blocks that users deemed invalid, so the miners had to quickly change their software to bring it in line with what users want.
Ethereum Classic has also proven that miners will follow users (AKA "the market"), as the hash rate on both ends of the chain quickly converged to the value of the respective tokens. *Not* the other way around!
Users *are* in charge.
(edit: that is, of course, users who can and do run full nodes.)
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:58:00
You must have not been paying a lot of attention then. 
There's Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited, all programmed to hard fork. 
I'd say at least one (former?) "Core dev" was involved with two of these. Or two or three "Core devs", depending on who you want to count as a "Core dev", and who you want to count as being "involved" with Bitcoin Classic. ("Core dev" is not an official title; meanwhile Bitcoin Classic listed a bunch of devs on their website that AFAIK hardly did any actual coding.) 
On top of that, Bitcoin Core is open source, so anyone else can fork that codebase at any time as well. You don't have to be a "Core dev" for that, which - again - isn't an official title or anything like that.
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:31:06
So what are you suggesting exactly? That Core devs should release a version of their software with every possible tweak they can make, so the market can decide? 
One version with 1MB block size limit. One version with 2MB. One version with 8MB. One version with a 21 million coin limit. One version with a 42 million limit.  One version that stops rewarding block rewards next week. One that stops the week after...
That's like saying McDonald's should sell every variation of every hamburger possible, else there is no free market for hamburgers?
That's not how this works.
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:24:09
Ha, these were actually rhetorical questions. But thanks for elaborating I guess. Now I have a better understanding of things you consider reasonable.
But here's the actual point you unfortunately missed: lots of people find very different things reasonable. You see that everywhere around you in the world, every day. Not only in Bitcoin. Sometimes it even leads to war and death :(
That is sometimes a bit of a problem. But in Bitcoin, we have found a great solution! Free and open source software!
Unfortunately, *you* don't get to decide what Bitcoin Core devs find reasonable, *they* do. *They* get to code and release whatever it is they want to code and release. But(!), *you* get to use that code for free! And that *even* means you can tweak the code, and rerelease the code in whichever way you see fit!
If that sounds like a great deal, it is because it is a great deal! It's as if McDonald's is giving away free hamburgers, and if you want to take the pickles off, or add some extra ketchup, you can! It's just that you will have to do it yourself.
It blows my mind that this deal is somehow perceived by some people as Core devs limiting freedom of choice.
@_date: 2016-08-18 10:00:11


The code is literally free and open-source software. Anyone can fork it, tweak it, re-release it, etcetera. If that's not enough freedom and choice for you, nothing ever will be, and you're just the type of person that wants to complain. So be it.


No one has to act "on behalf of users". Users can act on behalf of themselves. Kind of how there was never a consumer committee to decide which hamburger everyone should eat. No, everyone autonomously decided to go for the Big Mac, and that's how the Big Mac became the most popular hamburger in the world.
True, in Bitcoin there are network effects that weigh in. And that may require more communication among users. But still, no one is supposed to "map out" how everyone will organize, that can and will happen organically. Ethereum Classic has been a fascinating example. It started out among a couple dozen principled Russians on Russian-language internet forums, and spread like wildfire from there.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:16:19
Whether or not 75 percent is enough depends on that 75 percent. If they are willing to potentially leave 25 percent behind, they can fork. Today. No permission required. Not from anyone. (I personally don't believe for a second 75 percent of the community actually wants that. In fact I was personally not even aware of that poll until you showed it to me just now, which suggests it's not very representative.)
And no, "the Core team / Blockstream" has not been "pressuring miners" to do anything. For one, "the Core team" is not a monolith, it's an open software project to which anyone can contribute. Some guys who contribute (read: volunteer their time) went to Hong Kong and made a deal with some pool operators. But not on behalf of Bitcoin Core; they couldn't do that. Only on behalf of themselves. And *anyone* can do that. Regardless, other guys who contribute to Bitcoin Core thought that was a very bad idea. As mentioned, Bitcoin Core is not a monolith.
What's true for Bitcoin Core seems to be true for Blockstream as well, to a certain extent. The Blockstream co-founders who went to Hong Kong did so on behalf of themselves, not on behalf of their company. One of the co-founders of Blockstream even publicly called those that went to Hong Kong "dipshits" for making that deal. (By the way, even if they did go on behalf of their company, I don't think that would be a huge deal: Blockstream doesn't control Bitcoin Core, and it definitely doesn't control what software users voluntarily run on their own computers.)
I'm not aware of anyone being "pressured". (And I've spoken to several people who were there; that includes miners.)
@_date: 2016-04-09 13:18:45


Not from the point of view of a Segwit user.


Depends how you measure it. This is a pretty good piece on measuring decentralization:


He'll have to wait a couple of extra confirmations to approach the same level of security. Some relevant calculations:


Well, even non-upgraded nodes are still validating all (other) consensus  rules they signed up for. For example, to make sure bitcoins aren't created out of thin air.
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:23:48


Yes, users are decentralized. But that doesn't mean users will swallow whatever miners serve them.
(This is assuming that users run full nodes, of course. If they run light clients, they will indeed typically blindly follow the longest chain. Though even in that case these users may sell their bitcoin if miners push through an unpopular hard or soft fork; which would cut into miner revenue.)
I also don't see why users can't organize and coordinate as a group? We have this great tool called the internet, filled with forums and chatrooms and Slack channels and subreddits and all these other media built exactly for these kinds of purposes.


Core doesn't have "members". It's an open software project; anyone with the willingness and skill can contribute. (Case in point: some guys who contribute to Core went to meet miners in Hong Kong. Other guys who contribute to Core thought that was a profoundly bad idea.)


Yes, the level of mining centralization is obviously a concern. From what I can tell it's also a big concern for many Core devs, that's one of the reasons they work to decrease block propagation time. It's also a good reason not to raise the block size limit too much.
Mining centralization also makes it *even more* important that users can run full nodes, exactly so they won't have to swallow whatever miners serve them. Which is also a good reason not to increase the block size limit too much.
Indeed, the fact the Bitcoin Core is - by far - the most used implementation on the Bitcoin network today, seems to me like a much more important reason for miners not to hard fork. They would effectively fork themselves off the network. Users are keeping them in check.

Judging by r/btc, clearly not the Core devs!
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:45:33
The argument that the market could not decide without the(?) Core developers specifically building in a switch for some specific block size limit choice struck me as *so absurd*, that the best response for me was to extrapolate that logic further into absurdity. Hopefully, that would show OP that his suggestion was absurd.
@_date: 2016-04-09 10:17:36
SegWit is opt-in, so users that think 1.5MB is too much for them can choose not to upgrade. (They'll see &lt;1MB blocks, with no withness data.)
@_date: 2016-04-02 09:16:54
When I say "miners", I mean the entities that confirm transactions. That can be solo-miners or pools. Smaller solo-miners joining pools is a centralizing force in itself, as there'd be less entities that confirm transactions.
Indeed, if we *don't* start from the assumption that centralizing forces are a problem, BitPay's solution might be fine. We're probably not gonna find consensus on that assumption, though.
@_date: 2016-04-09 12:36:17
It's a compromise. (And I don't think Blockstream is pushing it.)

@_date: 2016-04-09 13:03:31
Nah. From the point of view of a segwit user, all that really matters is that transactions sent to him are valid. Which he can check, because he is running a full node.
@_date: 2016-04-09 12:38:46


Why should he care what kind of validation other users do?

@_date: 2016-04-01 19:52:34
Sending transactions to themselves is free, since they are the miners that include the transactions in blocks. (They either pay no fee at all, or they pay a fee to themselves.)
They don't even need to broadcast the transactions and risk other miners include them in their blocks. They can just include them in their own blocks when they find a block, no risk at all.
The incentive to do it, is that they could gobble up a bigger share of the mining market.

If we start from the assumption that big blocks favor bigger miners (and big blocks therefore tend to centralize mining, and we assume that's a problem), BitPay’s adaptive block size limit is no real limit at all. Big miners can create artificially big blocks by sending transactions to themselves, to continually grow the limit over time.
@_date: 2016-04-02 08:52:35


As in a sort of proof of stake polling kind of thing? I agree that would actually be very useful, and I think most Core devs will agree, too! If you code that up I think there's a very real chance it will be included in Core. And if not in Core, then in Peter Todd's fork and/or Bitcoin Knots. Probably Bitcoin Classic and Unlimited, too? If nothing else you can fork Core yourself and include it, such a vote system would in no way affect consensus rules, so no problems there.
Seriously, if you have the time and skill, code it up. (Time and skill are by far the biggest bottlenecks in Bitcoin development.)
@_date: 2016-04-01 20:36:02


By technical limitation I don't mean what miners *can* build, I mean what miners *should* build (without centralizing mining and increasing the cost of node operation too much.)
@_date: 2016-04-01 20:07:06
There's probably also more problems with BitPay's solution, actually. Like, blocks could grow too big even without manipulation, but simply demand being greater than technical limitations. I'm not the  expert here though, I was just answering a question.
Either way, I do love it when redditors come up with super-obvious solutions to very complicated problems!

@_date: 2017-12-25 14:18:01
True, but then it still needs to be accepted by the network (and specifically, miners). AFAIK most nodes reject conflicting transactions without a RBF tag. It's worth a try though.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:55:45

"Allow to increase the fee for outgoing transactions" &lt;- is that feature switched on?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:26
If you used a wallet that has replace-by-fee (RBF) enabled, you can re-send your transaction with a higher fee.
If not, you'll have to wait a bit longer.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:11:26
Yes, [lots of transactions]( are waiting in the queue to be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:10:34
What _should_ stop them is other miners including these transactions in their blocks. Then it costs the miners clogging the network real money.
That said, there are (probably) ways to game fee estimation algo's of most wallets, and IMO it is likely this is happening to some extent.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:43:53
Enable it. That way you can increase the transaction fee even after you've sent the transaction, next time.
Cancelling a transaction is kind of impossible. It may be forgotten by the network over time, but no guarantees there... 
However if you want it _confirmed_ there are some [tricks]( to make that happen.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:09:09


@_date: 2017-12-20 18:10:59
Long story. There are a number of improvements and optimisations that are being worked on and/or can already be rolled out. The most obvious example is SegWit, and it's not clear why it's taking so long for many exchanges, wallet providers, etc to utilize this.
But even if this was all improved, a healthy Bitcoin system does actually *need* a backlog of transactions:

I think I kind of like the idea, but who gets to decide which threads use this? The mods? Hard to be consistent...
@_date: 2015-12-28 22:07:48
If I understand correctly, miners are incentivized to include SegWit transactions rather than regular transactions.
So if you are a user, and you create a SegWit transaction, your experience will be exactly the same as with actual 1.6MB blocks. The same level of fees, and the same chance of your transactions being included in the next block.
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:39:55


Well yeah, GitHub is a platform for developers, so most signers there will be developers.
Of course, a large part of Bitcoin's user base agrees with the road map (at least for now) but didn't sign. (How large of a part exactly? I don't know. But I do know that you shouldn't take sentiment on Bitcoin subreddits (censored or not) at face value.)
@_date: 2015-12-29 03:32:24
It's programmed to increase the block size limit to 8MB one 75% of blocks mined support it, after which this limit will double every other year until it reaches some 8GB.
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:55:48


...which would be fine, because in that case users apparently don't care for a bigger block-size.


Who's "you" in this sentence, if not users?
@_date: 2015-12-29 12:16:20
I don't think 75% in favour is necessarily the same as consensus. It's a (super)majority. 
But that's not really the point of this thread. Please re-read what I originally said, and let me know if you have anything on-topic to add?
I said:


@_date: 2015-12-30 13:29:24


There are. 
Ben Davenport is probably the most notable example (BitGo CEO, one of the companies that signed the letter in support of Bitcoin XT.)
It also includes representatives from F2Pool and BW Pool (combined 30% of hash power), who previously supported a hard fork. (They were willing to go to 8MB.)
Additionally, it includes a bunch of exchanges, and wallet services, etc. Including Breadwallet, which previously supported Bitcoin XT. (Though they emphasize a hard fork will eventually be required as well.)
I'm also assuming there are a bunch of previously "undecided" names on there. But I haven't done an extensive analysis of all ACKs.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:19:50
What's wrong with competing versions?
@_date: 2015-12-01 11:35:16
Let me rephrase my question.
It seems to me like you're saying: we can trust miners to cooperate, because they depend on Bitcoin's value so they'll be good to those who give it value.
That's fair, but by that logic, wouldn't it be fine to just have one mining pool? ie. why does decentralization matter in that case?
In fact, why mine at all? Why not have Bitcoin Inc. set up a corporation in some low jurisdiction area? Sure, they could increase the 21 million bitcoin cap, but they won't, because it would hurt bitcoin's value, right?


That seems like a huge assumption to me. Why do you assume that bitcoin's value would drop if miners would try to screw each other over? (If they'd screw users over - sure. But each other?..)
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:34:50
Or, we can not be tribal about this.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:25:46
I'm not a Core developer, in case that's what you're thinking.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:54:08
There are a whole bunch of alternative implementations that are Core nor XT. (Most of them don't break consensus rules like XT does.)
See for example: 
@_date: 2015-12-02 15:04:08
@_date: 2015-12-01 02:36:59
But is this something we want to rely on?
ie. shouldn't we design for miners being adversaries rather than cooperative? (*Even* if they do cooperate?) Isn't that the sort of security that makes sure Bitcoin has value in the first place?
@_date: 2015-12-02 17:21:15
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-12-29 04:30:48
The consensus rules limit Bitcoin blocks at 1MB...
If your argument is that Bitcoin XT intends to break the existing consensus rules in order to create new ones, I would agree of course.
Is there a point to your argument you are getting at in the context of this thread? Or did you just want to point out that consensus rules can be changed?
@_date: 2015-12-01 16:39:29
You're pivoting your argument.
In your previous comment, you suggested that Scaling Bitcoin is a conference "designed to promote the idea of small blocks and off-chain solutions".
Now you're saying that "whether or not Gavin and Mike were invited and declined is irrelevant."
I think these two statements are mutually exclusive.
(Edit: Not to mention that you disregard the BIP 101 presentation because of... because of what, really? Because it doesn't fit your argument and/or preconception, most likely?)
As an aside, I would note that the Program Chair is Neha Narula from MIT DCI, ie. one of Gavin's colleagues.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:14:47


Actually, the Core Development team is and always has been the final arbitrator in deciding which features make it into Bitcoin **Core**.
If you want new features in Bitcoin, you can simply fork Bitcoin Core (it's open source after all), code up these features or pay someone to do that for you, and include them in your fork.
If this fork breaks existing consensus rules (like Bitcoin XT does), you'll need to convince the whole Bitcoin ecosystem to make the switch, or risk splitting the network.
You could also include something along the lines of your BIP in your Bitcoin fork, though I wonder where you're gonna find developers to code up any feature that any user might want? (Or am I misunderstanding your proposal?)
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:39:14
You keep using the term "consensus", while I originally said "existing consensus rules".
There is no denying that existing consensus rules limit blocks to 1MB, and that Bitcoin XT is programmed to break these rules.
As for the definition of "consensus" (we're going off topic now), I like David Graeber's definition:


@_date: 2015-12-28 18:06:00


As soon as SegWit is activated, all users can start utilizing it if they want. As such, for *them* it will seem as if blocks are bigger; they take up less space in the existing blocks and should be able to pay less fees.
Users who choose not to utilize it from that point out, probably prefer not to upgrade because the added cost of running Bitcoin with bigger blocks. (Or they don't care either way.)
I call that a win-win.
@_date: 2015-12-29 12:07:08

Maybe if you used it in combination with Electrum or GreenAddress. Otherwise, yeah I think not.
If you're really in a rush, there are some other tricks. Eg. spend all the coins in your wallet to a new address also in your own wallet, but this time include a _high_ fee. (Could be expensive right now, though.) If you do that, the whole bulk, including your "stuck" transaction, should confirm fairly quick, and all at once.

As soon as SegWit is activated, individual users can start utilizing it. As such, for *them* it will seem as if blocks are bigger; they take up less space in the existing blocks and should be able to pay less fees.
Users who choose not to utilize it from that point out, probably don't care about the advantages of bigger blocks (and/or prefer not to upgrade because the added cost of bigger blocks), so I'd say that's not a problem either.

That's a perfectly fair argument, but I'm not really here to argue about the block size limit in itself.
Different players within the Bitcoin ecosystem have different opinions on the block size issue. My job, right now, is to find out what these different opinions are, and report on that.
Whether or not these opinions hold any ground or not is a different story (literally - it's a different type of article). An important story, but not the story I am personally working on right now.

I assume that Chinese miners are (some of) the biggest users of Chinese bitcoin exchanges. It then follows that whatever is bad for Chinese miners is probably bad for Chinese exchanges.
Therefore, to me, it seems like common sense for Chinese bitcoin exchanges to oppose anything that could be bad for Chinese miners. Even if Chinese exchanges did not mine themselves. (Which, admittedly, they also do.)

Here's a longer explanation from Wang Chun, for those interested.
Me: "As far as I understand, the (main?) problem with oversized blocks, is that they would slow down propagation, increasing the number of pruned blocks (orphans). This could lead to further centralization of mining. Moreover, this is especially bad for Chinese miners, as you are behind 'the great firewall of China'. Is this correct?
And if that is correct, wouldn't you think that the Chinese miners would be at an advantage, while the miners *outside of China* are at a disadvantage? (After all, the miners inside China have a majority of hashing power. As such, you could argue that the miners *outside of China* are behind the great firewall of China.) Thoughts?"
Chun: "The Firewall of China may have impact on block propagation. I think the general poor routing in Asia may be more than that. For example, now from my 50/20Mbps AIS Fibre landline connection in Thailand, ping my server in Beijing takes 400 ms, but another TrueMove-H on my mobile phone takes just slightly over 100 ms. Sometimes data from Beijing to Hong Kong could be routed through U.S. West. Bluematt may have more info on this than me. I do not know if it leads to mining centralization, but this could give pools in China a minor advantage on orphan rate of course. I think it is fair, as we suffered the same high orphans back in 2013, when the U.S. and Europe still held major hashrate. Pools in the U.S. and Europe should find their own ways to improve connectivity to China. And the good news is we have better tools like the relay network right now.
Some people may argue we can afford 20 MB block as they can be easily uploaded or downloaded within 10 minutes, the typical time between blocks. But in the real world, the block data has to be transferred within a couple of seconds instead of 10 minutes to make the orphan rate at a reasonable level. In the past few months, we have an average orphan rate of 0.3%. It could be doubled even if the propagation and verification time increases by just 2 seconds.
Network propagation is one factor, but not the only one. Bigger blocks take longer CPU time to verify, larger disk space to store. As you may know, right now on an average computer, it usually takes a few days to fully sync a bitcoin node. If the block size increases by 20x, I don't know how much time it would take. So from this point of view, we are barely able to afford 1 MB block in 2015."

@_date: 2015-06-06 10:26:12


Yes, I did the article a disservice by combining that headline with this opener, as it makes it seems as if the headline was merely intended as click bait.
Although headlines (should) always draw attention, as does this one, I don't think it's unfair to say that the Chinese exchanges have rejected (the idea of) raising the blocksize to 20mb though.
It's actually the opener that might actually be a bit too "soft". These exchanges haven't just voiced concerns, they have made it pretty clear that they don't support this increase. It may not be 100% out of the question for either one of them, but still.
Either way, in part because of your feedback, I have adjusted the opener from "voiced concerns" to "criticized", as that might actually be the best way to put it.
@_date: 2015-06-07 11:43:28
Of course, but you can't really blame me for what the exchanges tell me.
This article is technically not about the block size issue, but about what the Chinese exchanges *think* about the block size issue.
Don't shoot the messenger.

@_date: 2018-08-10 07:50:32
Did you read the article?
It's explained very clearly that the initial plan for BIP148 was to get the *economic majority* on board.
For context, here's the segment we are discussing:




(Emphasis mine.)
The article *acknowledges* that a number of companies (eg.: Bittyliceous, Bitrefill) were on board, but at that point in time it was far from an economic majority (because no *major* companies like eg. Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken were). In fact, even if you look at that list of companies on the UASF website *now*, it almost certainly doesn't represent an economic majority -- and most of these companies were added later in the timeline.

I agree with most of what you say, which is why there will be several articles on this issue coming.
(Next up is web-wallets. Tomorrow probably. After that SPV wallets, mining pools, other exchanges, etc.)
However, I don't really see you point in this case, precicely because this article wasn't about miners. It was about exchanges?..
I also disagree that the word "reject" gives the impression that miners could *on their own* reject changes. I mean, yeah, I guess it's one way to interpreted it, but not the only way, and it's not how I meant it.
I do value feedback though, so thanks for that.

1. You're right, Luke doesn't "need" to provide a source. I can still ask, though.
2. It's difficult to prove a negative. IIRC most (major) companies didn't comment on the BIP148 UASF at all at the time. Still, [this tweet]( from BitPay CEO Stephen Pair comes to mind.
3. You claim that "many businesses" were on board, but you've only provided two examples, that aren't exactly the Coinbase's, Bitstamp's or Kraken's of this world. At that point in time (pre-"intolerant minority") the goal was to get the economic majority on board, and that just wasn't achieved. I was there, I remember it very well, but if you don't want to believe me we'll have to agree to disagree.

Because that's the bar set by the developers who wrote the soft fork.

@_date: 2016-03-30 16:45:53
There's a balance to be sought between too small and too big. While some developers think 1MB is perhaps a bit too big, none of them think it's disastrous, and therefore it's not worth the energy/commotion/outrage/etc of actually proposing to lower it.
As for miners... as far as I can tell most really just want to make money by mining and not bother with these kinds of difficult decisions. And since developers aren't actively pushing for a smaller block size limit, miners won't bother either.

Quick note: I've written for Bitcoin Magazine, CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph and BitPost, and don't share this experience at all.
I think BitPost asked me to write an article on BitPay once. That article included some critical notes, and was published nonetheless. I was not under the impression it was paid for.
CoinTelegraph accepts payment for pitches from companies, but it's still completely up to writers to decide if they want to do the story, and if so, how.
CoinDesk offered me a story on some kind of (new) company once in a while, but again, I was never under the impression that these companies were scams and/or that the articles were paid for.
I cannot recall a single instance where Bitcoin Magazine wanted me to write about a specific company. If it happened, I definitely didn't have the impression these companies were scams and/or that the articles were paid for.
Other writers might have different experiences, of course; just felt I should share mine.

- DDoS. First of, AWS offers no build-in protection against DDoS. (Not sure about Choopa tbh.) Second, can you be more specific about a situation where more targets to attack helps someone in some way or another? And is that something I haven't covered in my article? (Like transacting, or relaying.)
- Lower cost. Core &amp; Classic 0.12 offer bandwidth limiting, so users who feel they upload too much data can solve that with a click on a button. And again, from a network perspective this was not a problem in need of solving.
- Shutting down politically + privacy arguments. We covered this. I disagree. Sorry.
But ibrightly, can we maybe take a step back and remember why I wrote this article in the first place? It's because of this sort of stuff:
We can argue all day long about technical nuances regarding privacy and DDoS protection, and that's fine. But *in general*, you agree that this "show your love for Classic by running a node from a data center" campaign is silly, right?

That would only be possible if the block size limit is unlimited (ie. no block size limit at all) and miners basically include all transactions in the first block they find. I don't think anyone is arguing that as a serious option.


No because it seems you (still) don't understand how (opt-in) RBF works, and the scenario will literally never happen. TL;DR: If his wallet supports opt-in RBF, there would be a button "re-pay" and it would be solved, or it all would be fully automated in the first place.

Then there could be a split.
One Bitcoin with 90% of hash power and 70% of users.
One Bitcoin with 10% of hash power and 30% of users. (This group might want to hard fork to a new proof of work and/or difficulty to avoid slow block times for a couple of months. And perhaps to fork off miners that - from their point of view - acted against user interests.)
Point is: the vote would still not be binding. You can't have binding elections in a voluntary system.

@_date: 2016-03-08 11:45:45
Unconfirmed transactions in Bitcoin are never 100% reliable. In fact, even confirmed transactions are never 100% reliable.
Should wallets not allow users to send funds, because there's a chance miners won't accept the transaction for whatever reason?
Should wallets perhaps not allow users to accept zeroconf, by not showing any incoming transactions until they are confirmed?
In fact, by your definition of unreliable, 1-confirmation transactions are definitely not reliable. You could be looking at a block that get's pruned. Better not show any incoming transactions until we're six blocks in!
Heck, should wallets perhaps not even allow users to accept bitcoin at all? Who knows, perhaps there is a 51%-attack going on...
Bitcoin is just not 100% reliable. So neither is RBF.

Yeah, miners can also set an activation threshold on X/1000 blocks at which point the moon is made out of cheese. But if that threshold is reached, it doesn't mean the moon will actually be made out of cheese :)
If miners start mining blocks that don't adhere to the consensus rules that users apply with their full nodes, users won't accept these blocks as valid. (As such, these miners will be wasting valuable resources.)
That's why it's important users can run full nodes. They ensure miners can't hard fork against the interest of users.

I don't have the authority to decide what people do or don't call "Bitcoin". But if the Bitcoin Core developers want to implement an incompatible protocol, but some people prefer to keep using the current Bitcoin protocol, then yes, it'd be nice if "Core" picks a new name.
@_date: 2016-03-31 12:35:06
If you mean the Bitcoin Core developers: they are not in charge of Bitcoin's consensus rules such as the block size limit; the consensus of users is.
Furthermore, over the past years, there is literally no group of people in the world that has done more to scale Bitcoin to the levels we are at today. And they are continuing their hard work (which is essentially volunteer work, I might add); Segregated Witness is a great example of such an improvement.
What have you contributed? I mean, if you develop a proper way to apply sharding to the Bitcoin blockchain without risking Bitcoin's value proposition, I'm sure the Core development team will be excited to implement it! 
(I believe Peter Todd pointed out some problems with the concept of sharding  applied to Bitcoin though; but I didn't delve into this subject myself yet, so I can't tell you what it is.)

Even though he seems to have moved on to other things (like Satoshi and Mike), I think Amir Taaki deserves to be on that list. While I wasn't around back then, I understand he was very active in the development of Bitcoin during the first years, and he's a staunch 1MB supporter (even still).
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:02:55
This is all speculation. 
Transactions getting stuck, and not being able to do anything about it but wait, might shatter confidence much more. In fact, if RBF is widely adopted and in use I don't see any problem as for the confidence factor: everyone will know not to trust zeroconf (which they arguably shouldn't already).
I agree there's a usability factor to take into account, and I address that in the article.

@_date: 2016-03-25 09:27:30




I actually recently did a short write-up on my “bias” so I don't have to re-explain myself every week. [Here it is](
For this article, I did quite a bit of asking around (including on the Classic slack channel), and this was the most complete picture I was able to draw.
As for your arguments:
- Privacy argument. Let me see if I understand your argument correctly. You're suggesting you connect to the node in the datacenter with the node at your home to protect your privacy, right? But in that case the FBI could just ask the data center where the connection is coming from, can't it? So while it adds a hop, that doesn't sound like a lot of privacy protection? Unless you connect to the data center through TOR of course, in which case simply connecting through TOR in the first place sounds like a much better option?.. Am I missing something?
- Decentralization. So, pointing out that a certain type of attack hasn't happened before doesn't sound like a great argument to me either. Bitcoin is not Apache or SMTP. We haven't had Bitcoin before, so there is no last time to compare to. Well actually, that's not entirely true: the last time we had something *like* Bitcoin ([E-Gold]( it was shut down because it wasn't sufficiently decentralized.
- Pruning. So yeah, my original conclusion was: "Operating Bitcoin Classic from data centers does not currently provide much useful data to syncing nodes."
(Note that is says “currently” not “by definition”, and it says “much” not “any”.) 
From what I understand, data for syncing nodes is currently not a bottleneck, and therefore nodes in data centers don't help that much. It's as if there's a homeless guy in your town, and each day 100 people show up with food, and then you send another 100. Homeless guy can't eat that much yo.
If these nodes are pruned, they don't help at all, but that was kind of a secondary point and originally not part of my conclusion.
- SPV nodes. Original conclusion: "Operating Bitcoin Classic from data centers does not currently provide much useful data to SPV nodes."
Again, “currently” and “much”. Not a bottleneck that is currently in need of solving, as far as I understand.
Also, as pointed out elsewhere in the article, I think your fear of SPVs being sybil attacked probably actually increases if many nodes are run from the same datacenter, as it presents a single point of failure.
Not exactly the same situation, but for comparison of these type of single point of failure risks, also see:

You might not *like* the road map, think it's not enough, SegWit won't be done in time, or something like that. But suggesting Core devs are sitting on their hands is a lie, and a toxic one at that.

Nodes aren't "voting" in the event of a UASF either. At least not in a one-node-one-vote kind of manner which you propose.
Rather, people "vote" (by their economic weight). They just need a node to do it. But whether you run three nodes, or 300, you're still only one person, and it doesn't increase your economic weight, so that doesn't help you at all.
That said, to "vote", you should run at least one node. (And use it to transact.) Zero nodes will give you zero "votes".
(The problem you describe called a [Sybil-attack]( by the way.)

Right, Bitcoin is the protocol. And Bitcoin Unlimited is an alternative protocol. So as long as people want to keep using the Bitcoin protocol, it would be nice if the people that prefer to use the alternative protocol adopt a new name.

Miners decide which transactions they include in blocks, and under what conditions. If we assume that miners want to maximize their profits, which is assumed for the reliability of Bitcoin itself, RBF should be reliable.

- Privacy: Honestly, I think you're grasping at straws a bit here. You pointed out yourself that Tor and VPN are options, and I think they're better options as well. I don't feel sorry for not including this argument in my article. 
(Also take into account that my article was not so much about running a node from data center, but mostly about running tons of nodes in data centers, by a relatively small number of people, that don't seem to use it for transacting.)
- Decentralization: Yeah, sorry, I stand by what I said. Sure there will be more weak points. I'm not sure why that is an argument against what I said.
- Syncing &amp; SPV: "The more the better"... I guess it's hard to argue against that. (Maybe the homeless guy was not a great example.) So perhaps a tad more nuance would have been in place in that part of my article. However, the main point there was that it doesn't really solve an existing problem that needs solving. And if it ever does become a problem that needs solving, it will be easy to solve anyways. I think that still holds up. 
(On a sidenode: all these nodes in data centers need to sync themselves as well right? Doesn't that mean they're actually demanding a lots of data as well, and could perhaps even be responsible for the increased outbound traffic you're seeing? Just thinking out loud now though...)

Think "market" instead of "politics".
Who gets to decide that Starbucks sells the most coffee? No one "voted" for that, in a literal sense. Rather, the people buying coffee decide, by how much coffee they buy, and where.

Yes, it's an interesting case.
As long as the miners that opted to use the newer rules don't go back on that agreement, you should be more or less fine. Else it could get messy... you could be accepting "bitcoins" that most people don't consider "bitcoins", so you wouldn't be able to spend them everywhere :/

I kind of feel that “biased” is just an ad hominem. It probably means I wrote something you don't like for some reason, but it doesn't actually offer any type of valid argument. You're really just name-calling.
The first time people started calling me biased, was when I described Peter Todd, Adam Back, Pieter Wuille en Nick Szabo (you could say the “Core” side of the argument, back when it was Core vs. XT) as “[decentralists]( I didn't actually coin that phrase, I think the first time I heard it was probably from Kyle Drake, and Adam Back self-identified with it... so why shouldn't I use it? Because it implies they care about decentralization more than XT? Well they do! This was even [acknowledged]( by Gavin Andresen before I wrote the article, and by Mike Hearn [after]( And it's in Brian Armstrong's [slide-show]( too. In fact, it is now fairly common knowledge that there is a centralization trade-off at stake in this block size dispute, and that “Core” errs on the decentralized side of the debate. This common knowledge was almost completely absent at the time I wrote the article. So people called me biased.
The second time people started calling me biased, and this is when it really took off and I even became somewhat of a meme on r/btc, was when I broke the news that Chinese pools were “[sticking to Core]( Not only did I have two independent sources confirm that at the time, it's pretty clear now that I was well-informed.
So yeah, it seems to me “biased” is just an ad hominem. It probably means I wrote something you don't like for some reason.
To claim objectivity is making a claim to some kind of higher truth. No human being can claim that, and neither can I. I never did.
Since objectivity is impossible to attain, every human being constructs its own version of the truth. Where these differ, you could say it marks the space where “opinions” begin.
This is a tricky definition, because it basically means that no one can ever be wrong. They just have  a different opinion. [This guy]( for instance, was of the opinion there are eight days in a week. (Props to Paul Sztorc for [digging that one up](
Philosophically, it's almost impossible to escape this trap. So be it.
Here are some things I consider true:
- Bitcoin (capital B) is a settlement system, by design. The process of consensus “settles” upon a time-line of transactions. It's lowercase b bitcoin that's the currency. We'll (almost) certainly need layers on top of Bitcoin to scale bitcoin to billions of users and to realize instant payments.
(I would also like to point out that this is nowhere near a new idea or something invented by Bitcoin Core, let alone Blockstream. See for instance this [forum post]( by the recipient of the first ever Bitcoin transaction Hal Finney from 2010, this [interview]( with Libbitcoin developer Amir Taaki from 2014, and this [development mailinglist contribution]( by Bitcoin Classic developer Jeff Garzik from 2015.)
- Since users give value, they are effectively in charge of Bitcoin, by their economic weight. Not miners by hash-power, or even developers by merit, and not companies who built a service on top of Bitcoin. That's not to say miners, developers and companies are not important. They are, in so far *users* think they are important. Miners, developers and companies just aren't in charge - except to the extent that they are also users.
- Consensus is the name of the game. Consensus among users, that is. Not majority vote, or hash power voting, or whatever some commission would like to come up with, or anything like that. If users and (especially) software are not in consensus on what Bitcoin is, there could be a coinsplit. (Which might resolve over time, or it might not.)
- Bitcoin's core service is censorship resistance. All else follows from that.
(Another one I [borrowed from Jeff Garzik](
This, for me, is the truth. It's not want I WANT Bitcoin to be, it's what Bitcoin IS. It's how Bitcoin was designed, and how it works today.
Since objectivity is unobtainable, I think transparency is important. Readers should know who wrote an article, and what that person's truth is.
I do think I provide that transparency.
On [Twitter]( which I consider a personal medium, I'm quite opinionated. The same is true for other personal media, including my [Reddit]( account.
I also just provided transparency in my previous point.
No. That's a [fallacy](
If a journalist was to cover the eight-days-in-a-week discussion, he shouldn't grant these arguments equal time. Preferably, he should instead explain there are seven days in a week – not eight.
If I think one side is right, and one side is wrong, I think it's wrong to present these as equally valid opinions. And if I think one side is telling the truth, and one side is lying, I'm kind of lying myself if I present these as equally valid, as well.
That said, if both sides of the debate *do* have valid arguments, and the type of article suggests both sides will be covered, they should of course both be covered fairly, so readers are aware of the trade-offs. I always try to do this. (Do I always achieve this perfectly and flawlessly? Well, I'm a mortal, and we're at the cusp of a brand-new technology that we're all still learning about every day, so... probably not! But I definitely try.)
Any claim I make that's not self-evident (at least for me) and can be sourced, should be sourced.
Neutrality for me means you're not aligned with any specific interest group.
Some of my detractors like to say I am aligned with Bitcoin Core. That is absolutely not true. I do my own research and draw my own conclusions. It is true that these often resemble the conclusions “Core” has drawn, but that's not my fault.
I often ask proofreaders for input, and try to get proofreaders from both sides of the debate where needed. I have gotten push-back from both sides of this block size debate in the past, but in the end I decide what makes it into the article, and what doesn't. Well, and my editors typically have a say, too. More on that in the next point.
This is perhaps the most important one. I am an independent journalist. I have no stake in any company, any implementation, any other individual or anything else. 
Except for Bitcoin. I do hold some bitcoin, and I am making a career in Bitcoin. So it would be good for me if Bitcoin continues to exist. (I do try to stay critical of Bitcoin where needed, and believe I'm doing a fine job at that. Maybe someone “from the outside” will disagree; I don't know.)
Plus, for my income I rely on publications that pay me to write articles. Within the Bitcoin space, I have written for Bitcoin Magazine, CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph and BitPost.
I typically enjoy(ed) a lot of freedom within each of these publications - though at some more than others of course. I often pick(ed) most subjects myself, and fill(ed) in these subjects to great extent.
However, that freedom is never absolute. All publications have a certain brand they want to maintain and a certain audience they want to reach. I write my articles with that goal in mind. Editors regularly make slight adjustments to my articles as well. And it has happened a couple of times (but not often) that editors ask me to, for instance, nuance some parts of an article a bit myself. Perhaps to make it slightly less opinionated.
Sometimes I agree(d) with them, and was happy they helped me temper my statements a bit. Other times I would have preferred to do it my way, but saw their point and adjusted it. That's OK. I understand that running a publication is a team-effort, and I'm willing to make certain compromises as long as I consider them reasonably fair.

Hi. I'm not really sure what you're commenting on? Sure, hard forks are possible. FWIW I'm also perfectly OK with user groups hard forking -- though I wish they'd pick a new name for their coin is there's no consensus.
Regarding your comment: 
1. What is "node count miner difficulty"?
2. The idea that exchanges and wallets are kind of representatives of users is mostly flawed, IMO. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer technology. If a wallet or exchange supports a "Bitcoin" its users do not, users can switch to different wallets and exchanges.


Ethereum Classic exists, and is not worth nothing? It's a top 10 altcoin, in fact.


This is impossible to tell with certainty, because we cannot replay history without a hard fork and compare. However, we *can* tell with certainty that ETH + ETC combined is trading lower than ETH was before the hard fork, and *much* lower than ETH before there was any talk of a hard fork.
Also note that there wasn't actually much contentiousness about the name. Ethereum Classic just called themselves "Ethereum Classic" instead of "Ethereum", and everyone sort of agreed with that.

Well in both cases there is no consensus for a change. So in that sense it is comparable.
I think that pretty much any group of users, even small, can cause a coinsplit. 50/50, 70/30, 95/5... doesn't really matter, at least not from a technical perspective.
The more important question, imo, is how fundamental the disagreement is, and how dedicated the different user groups are. If the disagreement is less fundamental and the different user groups less dedicated, a coinsplit is less likely. If the disagreement is more fundamental and the user groups more dedicated, a coinsplit is more likely.
As mentioned, how fundamental a change is, is in the eyes of the beholder. And how determined users are, is of course up to them.

Actually, I care more *how* a decision is made, than I care *which* decision is made. I would personally not have much interest or faith in a Bitcoin where a majority of miners or developers have that decision-making authority.
Let me turn the question around. How are we going to decide to remove the 21M cap?
A) Let miners vote on it
B) Let a group of developers decide
C) Let any (group of) developer(s) propose any version of any software he/she/they want(s), and let every user voluntarily run that version of that software if he/she so chooses to
D) Only lift the 21M cap in case of emergency*

@_date: 2016-11-08 19:44:42
TBH I don't think your examples are very convincing. I doubt this is why BU includes this option. If you were right, they would have actually included the option to switch "block depth" off completely, like Core has. (Not only the option to switch it to an insanely high number, like 1,000,000).
But anyways, I see little merit debating this. So let's assume you are right, and this configurable option makes a lot of sense for reasons you described.
In that case: why does Bitcoin Unlimited allow non-mining nodes to change the max block size settings? These will be overruled by a majority of miners anyways. Surely you don't think it's the same reason? (Only for disabling behavior.) Because if you do think it's the same reason, the BU narrative and website is insanely misleading...

AFAIK Core devs tend to agree with that. Some have even made proposals or are working on them. But it's very hard to come up with a good algorithm for the block size limit. (If you have an idea, let's hear it!)
Bitcoin Unlimited hasn't come up with an algorithm either. Instead, they just put control of the blocks size limit in the hands of miners by hash power majority; a bad idea IMHO.

Hi Jacob,
Ok let me address your points:
1: Chinese store-of-value seekers... that's adoption in my book! Pretty great adoption actually...
I think the Trace Mayer YouTube-clip I linked to in my last post applies here. ("Why do we hire Bitcoin?")
edit: 
PS: Confirmation time is unpredictable per Bitcoin's design. But if you're frequently experiencing multi-hour delays, I think you need a wallet with better fee-estimation. (GreenAddress and Electrum also offer RBF just in case a sudden burst of traffic delays your transaction.)
2: Yes, Bitcoin Unlimited node operators can configure their settings such that it would cause a split among them. Example: some users could configure their settings to only accept 1MB blocks, and not accept &gt;1MB blocks until these are 100,000 blocks deep in the chain. If other users leave the default in place, and a majority of hash power mines four &gt;1MB block, the blockchain splits (for 100,000 blocks).
It's only *if* users don't touch that configurable setting, that BU cannot cause a split... but then why make it configurable in the first place?
Or, if all users agree not to touch that configurable setting... why let nodes even set a max block size at all? A majority of hash power can override it anyways.
3: Sure, yes, I meant if miners in general don't like it they can block SegWit. If ~95% upgrades, the other ~5% must upgrade as well. (And that's because Core set the bar for activation so high. In theory it could have been ~51% to activate - "forcing" the other 49% to upgrade.)
4: 
- I addressed the soft hard fork (AKA evil soft fork) in my previous post.
- The less invasive soft fork doesn't hold up either. Miners don't vote on hard forks, period.
- Full-out hard fork. I think you underestimate the dedication of those that want Bitcoin to be a sound money rather than a Nomic currency. (Credits for that reference go to Greg Maxwell.)
5: "I'd love to read more frank interviews with miners" &lt;- stay tuned :)
6: Remember: we were discussing a hard fork. Core devs have presented a road map, but they haven't really proposed a concrete hard fork yet. It remains to be seen how well that would go down.
But yes, sure, Core devs and miners can negotiate a proposal, and present that to the community. But that's what it would be: a proposal. In the end, the community of users would have to accept it.
I guess I would personally prefer to have community-wide negotiations in the open. (Like what happens on the dev-mailinglist.) But your idea is an option.
Re: SegWit soft fork. If miners reject it, so be it? Try a new proposal next year, I guess. I don't think Bitcoin's consensus rules should (or can) become subject to horse-trading. A proposal is either good, in which case it should be adopted. Or it's bad, in which case it should be rejected.
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:23:07


I disagree with that. Devs have no authority to increase the hard-coded 1 megabyte block size limit. Most devs happen to also agree it's not needed, therefore they don't propose an increase. But if they did propose it, that would still require all these users to accept their proposal. Devs can't just decide to increase it.

2: Let me try to be as clear as possible. BU has a "feature" where users will accept any block size as long as it's X blocks deep, where X is configurable. This is supposed to ensure that all users end up on one chain. But that makes no sense, because:
- Since BU users can configure that setting (for example setting it to 1,000,000 blocks deep), it means that different BU nodes can split off to different chains (for 1,000,000 blocks). No amount of misleading info in their FAQ can change that fact.
- If BU creators intended users *not* to touch that setting, why make it configurable in the first place?
- If BU creators intended users *not* to touch that setting, there is nothing "emergent" or "decentralized" about BU "consensus". Rather, a majority of hash power decides, period. (This is what Alp recently addressed in his piece on [Bitcoin Unlimited's placebo controls](
From the BU homepage:


Nope! Rather: 
- Whomever controls &gt;50% of all hash power calls the shots. 
- The chain can split and there will be no consensus at all.
What's on the BU homepage is just false advertising, plain and simple.
4: Yeah it's a bit of a quibble. "Economy" in this context = "people who accept ETC as payment". Essentially, people are selling BTC/ETH/fiat, and accepting ETC as payment. That's what makes it an "economy".

One of the great things about Segwit is that it is backwards compatible and opt-in. If Bitpay has other priorities that's fine by me.
Besides, if fewer people use Segwit it means blocks are smaller, so running a full node requires less resources.

Hm I don't really know what to tell you that I haven't already told you.
Miners don't determine the Bitcoin protocol, the Bitcoin protocol determines who is mining (and users determine what is the Bitcoin protocol.) This is most clearly demonstrated by the fact that Bitcoin (users) can change to another proof of work - even if every single miner on the planet would oppose it.
At best, miners may provide an incentive for users to switch to a new protocol (more PoW security) - but that's not the same thing.
If you hold another opinion it's probably best we just agree to disagree...

The main reason witness data is discounted is because that allows for bigger blocks. (Thus more on-chain transactions per ten minutes.)

Jacob, you've seen the BU homepage. Can we at least agree that it's very misleading?


Hm, that's kind of confusing. Earlier, in the context of absence of a sort of "governing body" of either developers or miners, you said: "I strongly believe this is a recipe for stagnation and being superseded by other projects capable of bolder technical growth." How does that not apply to a solidified protocol due to competing clients? I mean, I thought that was pretty much what you *were* referring to...

Only two weeks ago, a Princeton paper suggested that the 21M cap should be lifted:
That wasn't the first time this has been suggested. See for example:
Last summer, Ethereum hard forked because an investment company running on its blockchain was hacked. Crazy to some (including myself), apparently not crazy to others (including you).
The block size limit is probably the single most important parameter concerning decentralization; I can assure you that many people think it's very important.
What constitutes a "crazy" or a "non-crazy change" lies entirely in the eye of the beholder.

1. It's really not an excuse. If you're looking for a light wallet: I've frequently used BTC.com (formerly Blocktrail) and GreenAddress over the past year, and _never_ experienced a problem. Not once. Not even during the heights of "stress tests" did I have to wait for more than one or two blocks to have my transactions included. I suggest you give it a try. (IIRC Electrum is good, too; but I stopped using Electrum for unrelated reasons about a year ago.)
2. I was just presenting an easy-to-understand example. There are of course many possible configurations to have different BU nodes fork off to different chains.
3. (Apparently I actually *need* to put a "point 3" here, else I mess up the entire lay-out of this post.)
4. *"But given that miners have a much bigger (financial) stake in chain unity than, eg, Core devs do, both I and most miners might feel confident that at least among miners, the pretenders would be few."*
&lt;- Well we've seen something similar play out with the ETH/ETC fork. At first almost all miners hard forked to the new chain. Then more and more came back. As it turns out (unsurprisingly imho) miners will sooner or later follow the economy rather than the other way round. So if the economy is split over both sides of the chain, so will the hash rate be.
5. (See point 3)
6. *"My main concern about a truly decentralized, open, coalition-free consensus process is that basically no change will ever meet the threshold"* &lt;- I think changes that benefit everyone will meet the threshold. Changes that don't benefit everyone... yes that will be *a lot* harder. (But note that many people consider it a big plus that Bitcoin is hard to change.)

1. I think the statechain could be smaller than a blockchain. Just a chain of signatures, no need to verify or keep all the other (backup) transaction data.
2. On Bitcoin (on-chain) everyone needs to keep track of all transactions. But there could be many statechains, and you wouldn't need to keep track of everything that happens on all of them.

No, they are in the business of keeping Bitcoin secure.


AFAIK no one is suggesting the block size limit should remain at the arbitrary 1 MB limit forever.

However, I am even more concerned about the security of the network, as that *really" sets the stage for forever.

Sure, and I respect and thank you for that. I honestly believe the Bitcoin ecosystem would be worse off without your efforts, and yes, you obviously can't work on everything at the same time.
However, it seems to me that bigger blocks are a trade-off with centralization, and specifically a trade-off with the centralization of mining. Big trade-off, small trade-off, doesn't really matter: it's a trade-off.
As such, and exactly because Bitcoin is a democracy, I hope you can understand that some people are extremely hesitant to make such a trade-off. Not because they don't want Bitcoin to grow or because they want to stop it from being successful. But because it's a very painful trade-off to make.

But transactions are already free, right now! The only reason you pay a fee is because that's the default setting of your software; miners include transactions without fee just the same. How is this supposed to ever change if it's not through the establishment of a fee market?


But off chain transactions are *already* noticeably cheaper! And they probably constitute the majority of bitcoin transactions, since all exchanges use off-chain transactions. (If you buy or sell bitcoin on an exchange, that transactions happens off-chain. Because it is so much cheaper that way.)


But sidechains can be *more* anonymous than on-chain transactions! 
Not sure about the Lightning Network, but again, it's *optional*. While if the Bitcoin protocol is centralized in a handful of data centers, I think privacy could be killed quite easily.


I don't think it's ironic, I think it's realistic. If you want the whole world to use Bitcoin, technological limitations suggest that there will probably need to be some sort of centralization at some level. So the question is: do we want in on a protocol level, or on a level build on top of that protocol?


"Electronic cash" is not the full title though :)
The full title is: "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
I would argue that "peer-to-peer" is probably the key phrase in that title, as most money was already digital before Bitcoin was invented?..

Probably, and I'm not arguing against that.
What I'm saying is that anyone who wants to use the Bitcoin blockchain for payments directly (and not the LN) still can, as long as they are willing to pay the required fee to do so. 
Yes, this fee may be higher than what it is now, and yes, that can be considered a bad thing.
However, the LN cannot and will not be a prerequisite for using Bitcoin, and as such, is does not make its large central actors necessary for payments to be made on the Bitcoin blockchain.

@_date: 2015-08-18 15:02:26
Unfortunately, at this point, it seems like we are going in circles :-/
Let me reiterate my position one more time:
- I would be delighted if we could process and record all transactions everyone wants to do forever directly on the blockchain for free while keeping Bitcoin decentralized.
- Unfortunately, however, I believe real world technological limitations would only allow for this if Bitcoin would be run from a handful of datacenters.
- Therefore, and unless someone has a better idea, I would prefer more centralized solutions on a higher level than the actual Bitcoin protocol. Like sidechains, off-chain transactions, and the Lightning Network. While this is not ideal (see my first point) it would at least be optional. User who do not want to rely on solutions like these can still use the decentralized Bitcoin protocol directly, although they might have to pay a higher fee. I don't believe this fee will be so high that people literally can't afford to pay them, because most people would be fine with using sidechains, off-chain transactions and the Lightning Network for most transactions. (I know I would.)
I hope this makes any sense to you, even though you might have different preferences (which is fine).

I seriously doubt that fees will ever become so high that people literally can't afford to pay them. I just think they will be so high that people will prefer to use a cheaper alternative for transactions that don't really need to be recorded on the blockchain anyways. (Which I would argue are almost all transactions.)
If we come to rely on a handful of data centers to process and record all transactions, that is pretty far from the _peer-to-peer_ electronic cash system Satoshi envisioned and many signed up for as well, wouldn't you agree?

From what I recall (it's been a while since I interviewed him), that was very clearly part one of his argument. He doesn't mind higher fees as long as the system remains decentralized.


(Emphasis mine.)
He didn't say: "only" to settle debts. Just, "in particular". 
My interpretation: Bitcoin would be good for normal transactions if you're willing to pay the fee, and it would be good as an instrument to settle debts, too.


I never interpreted this as him saying Bitcoin should be used by banks only. (And that doesn't quite sound like Amir.) He just drew a comparison. He's basically saying that not every transaction needs to be recorded on the blockchain.
Re-reading the interview, I should see if I still have the audio recording laying around somewhere. I wonder if he might have hinted at payment-channel type of stuff, which could have gone over my head at the time...

My impression is that, in general, developers are in favor of a soft fork, or at least a soft fork first. And most seem to like Bitcoin Core's scalability road map. It's mainly CEOs that favor a hard fork. (There are some exceptions both ways.)

**Me**: Well, for one, it might get you into trouble with the law. Secondly, most people would probably not consider it the best possible PR either.
**Amir**: But I'm not acting through fear! (...)
(On the website, it now seems as if "Why?" was part of my question. But it was Amir's initial reaction. I thought it was very typical that he didn't even seem to understand why anyone would ​*not*​ want to promote DarkWallet as a money laundering tool, so I left that in on purpose.)

This is a feature **they're** very interested in having, because it's good for **their business**. And **they** see business being turned away because this issue isn't being addressed.”
“**These companies** that are putting tens of thousands of transactions on the blockchain every day have a real problem, right now, in that transactions are becoming increasingly unreliable. That's a problem **for them**, that's a problem for **their customers**.”

At first glance, the conditions of the bet seem a bit vaguely defined. Are we talking a contentious hard fork (among devs, companies, users, etc.), or a hard fork with broad consensus, or either? Are we talking sha256 hash power specifically? (Either the majority or  the minority chain might switch POW, in which case there will be no ASICs on that chain, so less hash power, but could still be secure.) What if exchanges support both chains? etc.

I do not. The vast majority of nodes on the network **does** reject &gt;1MB blocks.


That's a contradiction in terms. Dead means dead, there is no "as long as". Rather, in the scenario you describe, the network is perhaps sort of sleeping. Miners can return at any time, and as ETC showed (as well as tons of altcoins), hash power follows the market way more than the other way round. And even if miners don't return, a difficulty adjustment and/or POW change can be forked in.


Looks like we've found a central point disagreement :)
You know, I don't think there is anything inherently (*edit*: as in ethically/morally) wrong with your position. But it's not something I personally find interesting, and I don't think it's current reality. (*Edit for clarification*: Users pay miners to confirm transactions, most obviously with transaction fees. Users put a transaction out there, and whichever miner wants to mine it can have the fee. It's sort of similar with inflation: users put an inflation bonus out there (inflating their money) in return for security through PoW. So in both cases, users put out an award, and any miner is free to take it in return for a service. Miners are "hired" to do a "job". They don't go around selling a service.)
Additionally, I don't think there's much future in your envisioned path for Bitcoin. A Bitcoin controlled by a few large mining pools will probably be regulated to death, and even if that doesn't happen I don't think it will be able to compete in the marketplace with more efficient alternatives. (Alternatives that don't, for example, burn all that energy on hash power.)


While we do have a signaling problem, miners evidently (and probably correctly) assume that the network is currently not being Sybil attacked. (At least not as much as there are economically relevant nodes limiting the blocks to 1MB.)
How else do you explain there are no &gt;1MB blocks being mined?


Yeah, bad example perhaps. Good thing there are no unions in Bitcoin ;)


Yes, network effects matter. Even though no one is forced to play by certain rules, the incentives line up to do so. And that right there, my friend, is the beauty of Bitcoin :)


I'm sympathetic to that approach. But Bitcoin Unlimited by default also follows the longest chain after four blocks. That's a bad default IMO. (And as I understand it, you can't even switch it off completely, which makes it worse.)

You are right. I cannot with certainty say what (*edit*: economically relevant) nodes on the network will accept as valid*, nor do I know for a fact that's what's keeping miners in check. It's seems to me like a reasonable assumption that is at least one factor, though.
Edit: *Except for my own node of course. And the only node that matters is your own ;)


Ok so then you do agree that miners can be fired (or: "fired") if they don't provide the service users want? That's good :)


My preferred client will not follow the longest chain if that chain is not considered valid first. (This means no blocks bigger than 1MB, among other things.)

No. But I did have the option to run a different client.

Among the upgraded nodes: Sure.
Network-wide: It's the standard explanation, and it makes some sense. But I think Eric Voskuil presents an interesting counter-argument. If not all nodes on the network are in consensus over what the (edit: new) rules are, why call it "consensus rules"?
It seems we're now straying into a discussion on semantics, though? (Let's not.)


How can a standard soft fork increase the 21M coin limit?

Exactly. The market values efficiency. Decentralization is very inefficient. Bitcoin makes radical trade-offs in that regard.
Of course, the market *can* value some potential consequences of decentralization, like sound money or censorship resistance.
I don't think Bitcoin can be considered a sound money if the rules can be broken and replaced despite opposition - even if that opposition is a minority. I also don't think Bitcoin can be considered a sound money if users are no longer able to validate transactions themselves. (At least not for these users.)
And the problem with censorship resistance, is that we'll probably only realize Bitcoin has become too centralized when it's too late.


Hm? I don't agree with that at all? In fact, I thought you agreed that miners could be fired by users if they don't do what users want? :p
TBH many of the rest of your answers seem like arguing for the sake of it, with some straw man's hidden in there.

Voicing your displeasure won't change anything on this subreddit, I think.
I also think the comparison with Somalia is silly. I like to compare a subreddit more to a comedy club than to a country.
Lets say there is a very popular comedy club in town. It was the first of its kind, and got a great spot in the city center because prices were cheap back then.
Now, you are a comedian, and you have a sketch about african-americans. It's a pretty funny sketch, and well within the means of what is acceptable within the context of comedy.
*However*, the owner of the comedy club doesn't want it. Maybe because he wants his club to remain family friendly, or he's afraid of backlash from the african-american community, or whatever. Now you gotta choose, either leave the sketch out of your show, or don't perform at all.
This it *not* an attack on freedom of speech. After all, you can still do the sketch in another comedy club, or on the street if you will, or you could even start your own comedy club.
You can of course also state your complaint directed at the comedy club owner, and argue for a change in policy. That's fine.
But once that is done, and the comedy club owner still doesn't want it, that should pretty much be the end of it, I think, unless maybe you have a new argument to bring to the table.
Theymos, as the owner of *this* place, has clearly stated that he won't allow for discussion for Bitcoin XT, and has explained why. As such, from my point of view, the complaining everyday is starting to look a bit like nagging. 
As far as I'm concerned you are free to do whatever you want, that includes complaining. But at this point I would personally suggest to either accept the rules as stated by the owner of the place, or leave. (Or maybe propose a new argument concerning *why* talk on XT should be allowed.)

@_date: 2016-10-25 09:38:29


I don't know what your node does, but the [vast majority of nodes on the network]( would reject &gt;1MB blocks. Miners, therefore, don't mine &gt;1MB blocks; they need users to accept their blocks for them to have value.


Probably shouldn't have cut off the remainder of what I said, then: "(And therefore wouldn't it live on at all, I suspect.)"
Besides, I actually do hope that Bitcoin lives on in a meaningful way.


No, I don't. The ledger would still be in tact, even transactions would still be processed - though they wouldn't confirm. Transactions not confirming would be a problem of course, but it's a problem that can be fixed: change the PoW-algo.
Miners are really just employed by users. They can be fired and replaced. (Potentially even in such a way that users can mine themselves, as per the original design.)
Let me try an analogy. What you're claiming is that Deutsche Bahn would seize to exist if its employees don't show up to work. Sure, there may be no trains for a couple of days, and that'd be a pain. But DB can fire these employees, hire new employees, and life will go on.


No, but it's the only one that decides how big a blocks you will accept.


"I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It's completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. [...] The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work."
^ Paranoid!


It cannot.


Sure. But Bitcoin doesn't only rely on PoW. (We'd be using hashcash if that were the case.) It also relies on public key cryptography, a clever inflation schedule, and more. Nodes check for all of this stuff.


I suspect that the incentives align nicely for miners to not become evil, exactly because they can be fired. 
But if they ever do become evil, well, they can be fired, probably bankrupting their operation. This will presumably be a very valuable lesson for the next batch of miners, to ensure they *never* become evil.
If my assumption is incorrect, and miners for some reason always turn evil, we'll have to conclude that PoW is not the answer we're looking for, and we need a new consensus mechanism. (Or another way of ensuring miners cannot turn evil.)

FWIW, if I were mod I would allow for discussion on Bitcoin XT, too. The fact that Bitcoin XT could be what we all regard to as "Bitcoin" in the future (as acknowledged) makes it relevant for the Bitcoin subreddit imo.
However, I do follow Theymos' reasoning, and I think he should be allowed to do with his sub whatever he pleases.
At this point, therefore, I would suggest anyone complaining about censorship to either stop complaining (you don't like the policy, we get it) or gtfo of this sub altogether.

First, you say:


Then, you say:


^ Seems like a contradiction.


I really don't think "fired" is the right term here. Users aren't being paid to be part of the network. (Miners are.)
Regardless, let's say you are right.
I suspect in that scenario these "fired" users would sort of split into three camps. One group may begrudgingly change their software to join the 2MB network. One group of users may stay put much like ETC did, or hard fork to a different PoW-algo if needed. One group of users will lose interest in Bitcoin and quit altogether.
These latter two groups in particular will include people that are interested in Bitcoin as an a-political currency, and/or a decentralized consensus system. For these value propositions to hold, it is *crucial* that new rules cannot be imposed against the wish of users - even a minority of them.
If it turns out these rules can be changed despite opposition (especially if done through manipulative tactics), for these people Bitcoin (at least the 2MB version of Bitcoin) would be a [faile]( [project](
Note that these two groups may very well include pretty much all Bitcoin Core devs. Some of them have already indicated they would switch to a new PoW or quit, and I don't think they're bluffing. (Especially given how they've been vilified by the XT, Classic and Unlimited crew over the past year.)
Of course, Bitcoin Core devs quitting will be met with cheerful banter over at r/btc - never mind that these devs are responsible for pretty much *all* performance improvements over the past years. But even more important than a lack of improvements, I wonder who's going to [discover and fix]( consensus critical bugs when they pop up. Or who'll come up with solutions for other system-critical threats like broken encryption standards.
Again, even if I personally wouldn't mind a majority of hash power imposing new rules - I'd see no future in that Bitcoin.
nb.: FWIW like [Meni Rosenfeld]( I *will* defend anyone's right to split off. Like [Bram Cohen]( I also think it's the biggest threat to Bitcoin. Ideally those that want to fork just pick a new name, as forks of open source projects *always* do.

@_date: 2016-10-24 22:16:34


The problem as described in the article. (Sorry; I should have better explained what I meant.)


Running a full node is the only way to partake in the network in a trustless manner. As such, it also serves as an important check on miners. It ensures they aren't increasing the block rewards, prevents them from creating bitcoins out of thin air, and makes sure they keep to all other protocol rules as well.
Since running a node comes at a cost, and increasing the block size limit can (and probably will) increase that cost, it doesn't make sense to me to allow the miners to increase the block size limit. You allow them to decide how expensive it is for you to check on them.
IMO users (more specifically: node operators) should agree to increase the block size. (Luckily, this is not so much a matter of how it *should* be, "IMO". This is how it *is*.)
@_date: 2016-10-25 08:25:26


Yes, I do: the past year.


It really doesn't. Even miners have to run nodes.
Or, if only a small group of miners runs nodes, now everyone has to trust these miners. That means Bitcoin is no longer trustless, [entirely defeating the purpose]( It wouldn't live on in a meaningful way. (And therefore wouldn't it live on at all, I suspect.)


It doesn't. At worst, no blocks will be mined for a while, until new miners enter the system.


The only node that really matters is yours. Nodes empower the individual. Sybil-attacks are irrelevant.


If miners become evil, they will be fired by node operators. (Node operators can change the PoW-algo.)

If your goal is to try and convince someone of your perspective, I would suggest to go easy on the superlatives.




In the case of an evil soft fork, non-upgraded nodes don't experience a removal of the 21M limit. They just experience no transactions being processed at all (except for the coinbase transaction). 
Miners aren't obligated to process transactions; they're just economically incentivized to. So yes, users inherently accept that miners can one day choose not to process any transactions any more.
Of course, that doesn't mean users will have to learn to live with that reality. Instead, they can opt to switch (hard fork) to a new protocol, preferably with a new PoW-algo. Hopefully, new miners will suit users' needs better.


Well, yes. Redefining "consensus rule" is the point of the article. I think it's an interesting perspective, at least. You clearly don't - ok.
@_date: 2015-11-10 11:59:20

@_date: 2016-10-29 16:27:37
I'll respond...


Of course.


Really? Based on what? FUD you read on r/btc? Bitcoin just hit $700. Adoption is surging as far as I can tell.


Rather: If we let the miners pick the block size, they **can** pick a size large enough to centralize mining in a few hands. And more importantly IMO: they can pick a size large enough to centralize full nodes in a few hands. (At which point Bitcoin would no longer be trustless.)
Whether or not we can trust miners to refrain from doing so is another question, and not an important one. Bitcoin was designed [not to have to trust anyone](
Note: this is often misinterpreted - by you as well - as to say I do not trust (or respect) miners or something like that. That is *not* what I am saying. Miners seem pretty trustworthy at this point in time. I am saying it should be *irrelevant* whether or not miners are trustworthy.


First of: note that the notion of "firing miners" came up because others brought up a scenario where miners turn "evil". Firing miners is a nuclear option that I personally don't think lightly of.
And yes, "miners are at the mercy of the community who can 'fire' them" is a pretty disrespectful way of putting it. It's like saying: "My employees are at the mercy of me, because I can fire them." Of course, I didn't put it like that - you did.
That said, technically yes: miners are "at the mercy of the community". Because the community pays them to perform two specific tasks. The community pays mining fees to have transactions included in blocks, and the community puts an inflation bounty out there for PoW-security.
If miners stop performing these tasks, obviously they should not be paid.


Again, "whining" is your word, not mine.
I also don't think it's true miners are being ignored. There's been a Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong so Chinese miners could attend, there was the Hong Kong Roundtable with Chinese miners, there was a more recent gathering with developers and miners in California.
SegWit even includes an effective block size limit increase. (SegWit could have just as well been proposed without a block size limit increase.)
And if miners don't like SegWit, they don't have to accept it. That's the nature of soft forks, and why this particular soft fork even has a 95% threshold. 
Miners are in no way being ignored. Much like other infrastructure providers (exchanges, wallet services, payment processors, etc.) their opinion matters. That's why I have personally spent months and months polling all corners of the community to find out how different parts of the Bitcoin world feel about this issue.
But in the end, users are in charge.
Most miners are often also big-time users, so that gives even more weight to their opinion. But as miners, they cannot hard fork to new consensus rules. It's the other way around: Bitcoin's consensus rules determine who is mining.


Ok but who is supposed to negotiate with whom? Users are ultimately in charge. Bitcoin is based on personal autonomy among all users, not elected representatives.
If a room full of developers and miners can "negotiate" a hard fork to Bitcoin's consensus rules, Bitcoin has become too centralized and has effectively failed. (Luckily this is not the case, and won't be the case as long as individual users can run full nodes.)


It really doesn't. 
Even an evil soft fork would require users to "upgrade" their software. If they don't upgrade, they experience no bigger blocks.
They would also see no transactions confirm. In other words: miners wouldn't be doing what they're being paid to do. Plus, they'd be preventing other miners to do the job instead, as these blocks would be orphaned. It'd effectively be a 51%-attack.
You argue that's the leverage miners have... but now it actually does start to sound a lot like blackmailing. I hope Bitcoin's consensus rules don't become subject to these kinds of games.
I also think users have way more leverage than miners. 
Users would have to download and install new software, with a strong incentive to do so (after all: transactions aren't confirming). An inconvenience.
But if they do go through this inconvenience, that would instantly render all custom mining hardware worthless. That's not just an inconvenience.
(Also note that an evil soft fork would present the exact same level of inconvenience for users.)


Hash power majority =/= consensus


BU's proposed method =  hard fork, just like any other hard fork. And that's indeed blunt.


False dichotomy, see: 
Let me instead ask you: if more througput = more adoption, why isn't everyone using Dogecoin instead of Bitcoin? (And before you think I'm joking: some people actually suggested Dogecoin would be the coin people use to transact, because of lower fees etc.)
Here's a hint: there is real, empirical evidence that the fees in Bitcoin are so small that most users don't care at all:

As I said elsewhere in this thread, I think you are right. I did not completely, 100% debunk this myth. (It's probably very hard to do so, even if it was 100% myth. After all, it's impossible to look into someones brain to see what his intentions are.)
I would like to note though, that I stated in the article that:


I do think that still holds up. Though maybe I should have stated more clearly (like I did for the 11th myth).
 &gt;When there are people working both on Core and for Blockstream, and the Blockstream business model depends on the bitcoin blockchain being unable to handle a large volume of transactions, he would be hard-pressed to convince people that these players have some OTHER reason to cripple bitcoin.
Indeed I didn't to that in this article. But I did link to another of my articles that does:

Hm, somewhat uncharacteristically, not really a great headline selection by I think.
This argument, "there are no spam transactions in Bitcoin", is typically employed by the likes of Mike Hearn, who take it to mean that the block size limit should be increased to *whatever* level it takes to record *any and all* transactions *anyone* wants to send for *whatever* reason.
Andreas, of course, says the exact opposite: not all transactions can be recorded on the blockchain. Which ones will, and which ones won't, will be determined by the fee market. Transactions that pay enough fee should not be considered spam.
(I personally tend to agree with that, except that as in any market, it's ultimately up to the seller to decide. The miners decide if they want to block transactions for being "spam", not Andreas.)

@_date: 2016-10-24 09:13:22


That makes the problem worse, not better. It means that a majority of hash power can override the preference a node operator has, shifting control from users to miners.
(In BU's defense: it is a configurable option, so node operators can take that power back. But it's still a bad default IMO.)
@_date: 2016-10-24 13:47:24
Right now a majority of miners can:
1) Block transactions ("blacklisting") 
and 
2) Revert ("double spend") transactions
They cannot, however, arbitrarily change Bitcoin's protocol rules; full nodes serve as a check on miners. (FWIW this is also mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper; first paragraph under "11. Calculations".)
Handing control over the block size limit (a protocol rule) to a majority of miners clearly shifts more power to a majority of miners. Especially since a majority of miners then decides how expensive it is to run a full node, hence how expensive it is to serve a check on them. So yeah I'd say that's making things worse.

Ironic. You talk down on users for blindly following Bitcoin Core... while at the same time expecting users to blindly follow Bitcoin Core if Bitcoin Core would lead a hard fork.
I would argue that the main reason Bitcoin Core has any "supporters" in the first place, is that Bitcoin Core has a rigorous peer review process, stopping them from merging controversial hard fork code. You're asking them to abandon that process... but the most likely outcome of that would of course be that Bitcoin Core loses much of its support.
Indeed, it is very evident that not all so-called "Core supporters" would follow Bitcoin Core under all circumstances. Just look at the support that's been building up for BIP148, which has *not* been merged into Bitcoin Core.

Since it's weekend, and I'm killing some time...
Here's Mike Hearn explaining that the block size limit was meant as a temporary clutch (anti-spam measure), and has become unnecessary since the introduction of SPV-clients:
Fact is that Mike Hearn has a Google-mindset, where demand must simply be met, hence by increasing capacity. Google Maps must be able to handle whatever load that's thrown at it. The solution to IPv4-addresses running out is not to charge for IP-addresses, but to introduce IPv6. Etc.
I believe he also touches on that in this talk:
As for "the likes of Mike Hearn" (what I really said)...
Here's a top-upvoted post on from someone claiming there is no such thing as spam, just "paying customers":
(I see you agree with me that it was pretty obviously spam by the way!)
In the same category:
I've seen similar discussions on the Classic slack. I've also discussed it in person with Mike when I met him in Berlin a year ago.
I suspect the reason you're calling me out, is that you... je voelde je aangesproken ( &lt;- what's the right English translation for that one?).

Right, but note that exchanges don't even need to be part of the economy, which I would essentially define as users: those who accept bitcoin in trade and hold on to it as store of value. Exchanges are ultimately service providers. (Of course, exchanges are often effective holders, as a proxy for their users who store their bitcoins on the exchange. But it's good to make that distinction regardless.)
Exchanges have a bigger role in the naming issue: how a coin is listed. (BTC/BTU/148/etc.)
Either way, you're of course right that no(t many) major exchanges are actively encouraging BIP148. Then again, no major exchanges are actively discouraging it either AFAIK?
Also note that, according to [this page]( there is actually a bunch more of (presumably smaller) exchanges who've stated they prefer BIP148. Bitcoin India, Bisq (formerly Bitsquare), CoinGate, Échange de Montréal, and others.

I honestly wouldn't know, sorry. I have to assume they're significantly smaller than Kraken.
I do think it's fair to say that almost every Bitcoin user in The Netherlands has used Bitonic at some point. It's an easy entry-point for newbies in particular.
If you're a serious, high volume trader, you probably wouldn't use Bitonic though, because their margins are relatively high compared to actual exchanges. (You may use bl3p instead, but bl3p is relatively new so probably low volume still.)
Either way, if BIP148coin becomes a thing, I'd bet that most exchanges would support it, because trading volume Legacy &lt;-&gt; 148 (so, trading fees) ought to be high. Just look at what happened to the trading volume ETH &lt;-&gt; ETC in the first weeks.

Hearn believes we should not hit the limit because bad things would happen if we do:
If hitting the limit is inherently bad, that means the limit should be raised every time it comes within reach, which means there effectively is no limit.
He's also said that he doesn't believe a fee market should ever develop, not based on block space scarcity anyways:
He's also been asked at which point it's ok to cap capacity, to which at my knowledge he never formulated an answer. You'll probably find some evidence of that in this thread:
There's probably more examples out there, but to be honest I can't really afford to spend my afternoon digging up links for you.
So maybe we should turn it around. If you think I am wrong, and Mike was ok with capping the limit at some point in the future to exclude certain types of transactions from being included in blocks, can you point me to where he said that?

If you prefer, it's also fine if you find me a quote where he says fees should be used to limit average blocksize.
He wrote and talked a lot about this issue, and you seem pretty certain of your case, calling me out and calling me biased. So it should be easy to find.
(If you want to save time, I would suggest not to look for a quote where he says fees should be used to limit average blocksize. Mike was actually a pretty smart guy, and I think he'd know that is a broken solution. Edit: Then again, he also thought equally broken assurance contracts would be the way of the future...)

IMO those that split off should pick a new name -- or a new name should be picked for them, eg. "BTU" for Bitcoin Unlimited. That should avoid most of the confusion. (Of course no one can enforce this -- similarly no one can stop people from splitting off anyways. It is what it is.)

Well, Bitmain says it will privately mine that chain for the first three days. So at first, other miners don't even have that option. And since that hash power on the private chain isn't mining LegacyBTC, is only increases 148BTC's odds.
After these three days, it's perfectly rational (and expected) for miners to just mine the chain where they earn most.

If BIP91 activates before August 1, a majority of miners should only be mining bit1 blocks, which would be accepted by BIP148 nodes just the same.

It checks all transactions always. (Keep in mind that full nodes already check all txns for validity.)


As said, full nodes already check all txns for validity. Whether and how scalable that is, is indeed the big question. (Most likely IMO, Bitcoin will require added scaling layers to handle that level demand.)
TBH I'm not sure how much more CPU power Stealth Transactions would require from a full node. But I suspect it wouldn't be that much.
