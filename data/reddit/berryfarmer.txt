You can't fork gold.
You can't politically manipulate gold.
You can't insert a backdoor into gold.
You *can* destroy the pricing mechanism of gold via naked short selling and paper gold contracts. Bitcoin is immune to this attack via it's verifiability on the blockchain. Which simultaneously defiles any chance of achieving fungibility in its current form. At least gold is fungible.

there's a howto on the oniontip site:
OnionTip runs in an open manner and retrieves all its data from the network consensus data published in the Tor network. To get your running relay included, it must have a valid bitcoin address listed in its contact information. The contact information is listed in the Tor config file which will typically be at /etc/tor/torrc on GNU/Linux systems. Your ContactInfo line should include a bitcoin address as in the following example.
ContactInfo admin - 1MiJ46CgV5pJzJy3aHvnwCvvpSN45q3Xva
Once you have made the required modification you will need to reload or restart your relay (service tor reload). After a couple of hours you should see it included in the list below.

You may omit some of the mixing junctions if you're not as paranoid.
Be sure to let the coins sit on the exchange for a while if using large amounts (25 coins or more for Bitfinex, lesser for the alt-coin exchanges, a 100 coin deposit on Bitfinex and immediate withdrawal will result in getting your own coins back), and check taint afterwards on Blockchain.info to make sure you did not receive back your original coins.
If using Bitcoin Core (highly recommended) be sure to set SOCKS5 proxy to 127.0.0.1:9050 while Tor-Browser is running.
~~./bitcoin-qt -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050~~
    ./bitcoin-qt -proxy=127.0.0.1:9150
Also, enable "Coin Control" in the Bitcoin Core settings for maximum control over coin movement and change addresses.

David may be referring to ICO's here, but Bitcoin will encounter serious fungibility problems propelled by soon-to-be regulation. Today, in our speculation driven euphoric dreamland, these words don't make sense, but they soon will. Bitcoin may be an exceptional somewhat-decentralized database, but it is no currency, for its units are not, and will not be fungible due to regulation, blacklisted coins, green addresses, and loss of privacy.

@_date: 2017-09-19 20:52:26
In true centralized fashion, what matters is what Coinbase thinks of this, or Amazon, or whoever is accepting the coins. What matters is how many levels deep Amazon scans the chain for taint. If they scan 5 levels, maybe the coins are tainted, maybe they aren't. It's up to them.
With a fungible coin this vulnerability doesn't exist.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:24:53
Given that Bitcoin lacks fungibility this event is unlikely to happen on an extended timeframe unless hidden actors wave the hand of stimulated adoption to fulfill their particular ulterior motives.

But you are ignoring the scenario in which Coinbase refuses the Bitcoin that have been received by the MJ grower via the atomic swap. In such a scenario he will then have to swap again, hoping for untainted coins the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th go-around.
In this case, as has always been the theory with regard to Bitcoin, the grower will cut out the middle man, holding the fungible coin directly. Just as was always theorized -- that people would forgo holding USD and instead hold Bitcoin due to its ease of use and technical superiority, the same will occur with whatever fungible coin becomes the new normal.

The chart is extremely misleading, none of the Bitcoin clones can have confirmed transactions reversed.
The crisis will involve the infinite number of clones that will be created of each respective coin. There will be dozens of Bitcoin clones.
This will usher in a centralized IMF-backed one world currency, as the open source currencies will be in shambles, and people will beg for centralization as they tire of wondering what the coin of the day is

Due to Bitcoin's inherent lack of fungibility, and extremely low likelihood of ever being fungible, this may not have been the best idea.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:39:38
An extreme example, but the WannaCry ransomware tainted coins would never be usable at Coinbase. This cannot happen with a fungible money, such as with gold.
The video outlines that the eCash being predicted will make it extremely difficult for governments to collect taxes. Bitcoin is the polar opposite of this notion, it is the most traceable currency to ever exist. Bitcoin will not make it difficult to collect taxes, it will make it simpler.
I don't write this from a perspective of envying this prophesied society of tax evasion, but from a literal viewing of the video. My personal views are agnostic in this argument, and the argument is Bitcoin is not the currency prophesied in the video, not even close.

Yeah, and "Bitcoin isn't anonymous", and "Bitcoin may eventually be hacked since it was made by humans that are fallible".
Full of lots of goodies!

Oh I see. Gandi is quite serious, they're one of the oldest registrars on the net.

No. Greed is powerful. I bought at $13, speaking from experience.

To allow people to dump them, yes. He exchanges them for USD immediately.

ZeroCash doesn't exist.
Steal Addresses are a joke (a la DarkWallet).
I've been in Bitcoin for many years now, and this is getting old, please think up a new vaporware scheme to sell everyone on.
Green addresses *will* be implemented in Bitcoin, there is no question of if, but only when. Bitcoin will become an Orwellian Nightmare after all is said and done.

If this happens (a big if) convert bitcoins to gold.
Provident Metals would be happy to sell to you.
Gold will be much more stable in price than bitcoin. Youbcan then sell the gold to any big dealer like APMEX for cash in blocks of $25000 (maximum insurance on Registered Mail)

Peter Schiff (Irwin's son) believes Bitcoin is a bad idea.
He has a great debate with Stefan Molyneaux on the subject.

The worst part is, much of the time is right. only defense is "ignore the trolls" which doesn't say much for their weak arguments.

no matter how the fork works out Bitcoin will still not be fungible

US Dollar bills aren't money either, (they're currency) yet they're accepted everywhere in The United States.

More predominantly, he sells financial guidance on investing in emerging markets. He only recommends a 5% to 10% allocation to gold and silver, leaving the rest to invest in income generating assets.

This is the same logic the moon kids were using to say bitcoin would be $10,000 in early 2014.

In this scenario the teleportation technology is accompanied by an always-on GPS system, so the government always knows where the teleporter is. It is possible to attempt to scramble this GPS system by walking into shopping malls which act as Faraday cages, but it's quite a sloppy procedure and doesn't always work as planned.
Due to this analogy of a GPS system Bitcoin inherently lacks fungibility, one of its main initial selling points. It was "anonymous". The Bitcoin technology is an Orwellian Nightmare in disguise.

it's not going to do any good if the layer 1 chain lacks fungibility

I honestly can't count the number of times I've read "Localbitcoins exploding" on this sub. 3000 bitcoins per week is not explosive

Nah. Nobody uses Monero.
