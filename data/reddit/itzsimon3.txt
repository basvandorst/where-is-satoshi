Why does the price matter after you sold...
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:51:19
I see the bull trend ending and going into a bearish lower high and lower low.

Trying cashing your coins into USD with the ledger... you can't! So you still need coinbase

Jokes on you because it is at $3200

Well I held lots of bcc before and during these events. Let me tell you that I didn't profit much with the big crash yesterday that affected all crypto. So lets not keep blaming bcc when we are all on the same boat. As a community we need to educate the public about crypto and quit debating who is better.

He sold the 40BTC at $6250 each. Dummy
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:04:05
He didn't buy at 2k, 5k, 10k, 15k... he bought at 19.5k when the top was 20k. Idk if this is bad luck or stupid.

Don't listen his dumbass. You have to use a middle man service. You are doing great!

Make money. Isn't most of everyone here to invest and hold these coins for value? No one wants to use bitcoin because it goes up in value. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:48:32
They said they were doing this for the five states months ago.

I recommend doing it the traditional way with fiat. You have to write your sale price on the title transfer. 
Technically what you are doing:
-Buyer: change crypto to Fiat
-Fiat goes to Seller for car (cap loss)
-Seller buys crypto with fiat 
-Seller sells crypto for fiat (cap gain &amp; income tax)
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:25:58
No, but at the same time I do believe in the technology and the ease of money transfer. I think the satoshi idea is long been useless and there is a bigger picture. I think platforms like ether and Neo will be more successful in the long run. Bitcoin right now is basically a piggy bank for people to store their money.
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:31:56
We have to file taxes on our business. Unless you want the IRS on your ass, you want to use a service like coinbase. Now let me ask you, Mr. Satoshi, why the hell is BTC worth $11k if it is supposed to be used as a peer to peer currency?
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:12:10
Thank God because PayPal's buyer protection is so bad for sellers.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:03:43
You have to pay the gains as income on every transaction...Good luck in jail for tax evasion ... don't drop your soap. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:09:29
You won't have to report anything because you sold your car less than the original cost, it's considered a capital loss.
The question is when you sell the BTC, this may be considered as income tax plus capital gain if you wait to sell. Also state income tax will go into affect here too. California has a 13.3% cap gain tax on top of your income tax. So it is best to sell your crypto in states with lower cap gain tax.
The best thing to do is sell it for Fiat.

You do know this is Russia not Costa Rica...

You must not be Russian lol 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:57:22
I said one of the most corrupted... learn to read before you defend mother Russia with your words.
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:42:40
Yes. Can you imagine the Russian police coming to Coinbase headquarters and arrest employees? That is not possible.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:47:22
True but I prefer a class lawsuit over an international lawsuit. The cost goes through the roof with translations and travel cost for the law firm. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:30:41
That means they established a company in the U.S. Their domain in Russia should still be active. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:37:24
This all sounds like a bunch of bs from a corrupted company in one of the most corrupted countries in the world (Russia). The FBI cannot just walk into a location in Russia and seize equipment and arrest staff... no Russian would ever let that happen. In my opinion they are buying time until they figure out how to get the money out for themselves and distract the public. Y'all should know better than to trust a Russian exchange in the first place...
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:57:05
Hope it all works out. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:57:12
So what is keeping them from not refunding. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:42:25
This whole thing is speculations... no one cares how or what is happening. People want their hard earned money back. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:41:35
Then their server and domain in Russia should be active and running. Operation should only stop within the US. Correct?
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:18:46
������ tell the world something they don't already know.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:04:35
Russia just reduced US embassy staff by 75%.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:36:23
My point was that the FBI cannot take down Btc-e as a company that is located in Russia. The seizure of equipment in California does nothing for the behind the scene sketchy operation that btc-e is doing. The money is gone and no one in their rightful mind would create an international lawsuit against a foreign company, especially in Russia. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:21:10
Those are Cloudflare's server, not BTC-e's 
Traffic was routed to Cloudflare's servers before being forwarded to BTC-e's 
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:02:28
In what right mind do you think I would answer a personal question like that? How does knowing my age have anything to do with this topic...

You do know the 300 Spartans were slaughtered at the end and the City of Sparta fell to the Persians right?

You mad because your payment didn't go through? Don't think it is Coinbase's fault.
