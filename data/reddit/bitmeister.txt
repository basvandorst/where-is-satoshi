A short term observation: I love the Friday Fails and Miraculous Mondays, where the DOW/S&amp;P will shed 1 - 1.5% on a Friday and then BAM! it's back on Monday. Someone's prying hard over the weekend!
The Euro/Greek threat, FED rates and the "unemployment" figures are entertaining to watch, as they are all used as an economic control (FUD control). All in an attempt to keep equities the only game in town.

Interesting hash stats. Reaching a plateau in hashing growth. Two bottom charts show 30-day average of percentage of daily growth is nearing zero. I won't buy in until I see another uptrend. If the miners are trailing off, then I'm not in a hurry to jump in, although I will really be tempted if it hits 150.

The FEDs only have a limited number of controls they can use *too* influence the dollar/economy. Having moved the primary control, interest rates, *too* zero or near zero, they've run out of options. All they have left is threatening *too* change the rate. Unfortunately, that *to* has run its course, as *there* now officially the boy who cried wolf.

I know that this point is about cost-benefit, but **I want to add a note on underutilization**. I pay for two separate fiber connections, a primary and backup. I have to pay for the backup, and it sits largely idle. It will be hosting a node soon. Should I ever need to commandeer the backup connection, I could suspend the bitcoin node and the bitcoin network won't feel a thing.
This is an exaggerated, obvious case where I have two networks, but the other more subtle case is the underutilization of a single line. Most server builds have planned excess storage and bandwidth, and most bandwidth is purchased in large gradations. Nothing would satisfy me more than utilizing what I've paid for.

One thing further, I don't recall if you considered NFC in addition to BTLE? I think it would round out the use cases. It would be nice to be able to simulate key and lock operations, where it takes a deliberate close proximity as the act of unlocking. This would apply to lower grade security, like a casual desktop login/profile, the door to your house, fast food purchase, etc., cases where BT is too far.

Which party to the deal was defrauded? The customer got a program, the program yielded a result, the customer was satisfied. The seller created an invoice, gets paid and the seller is satisfied. Seller applies appropriate accounting and IRS collects tax on the net sale. (But are they ever satisfied?). A purely software solution was provided as a service.
If you're the buyer, and not comfortable with purchasing a program, or perhaps you're an international buyer, then [use the classic PGP solution and write the code in book and sell the book]( BOOM! Free speech! **For fun, you could call the book *Magical Numbers*, like voodoo, where applying the numbers will yield great riches.**
These examples serve to highlight the fact that Bitcoin is a protocol, a simple means of communicating with math, which is a natural fact represented in a language form, and that as hard as the gov't may try, the transmission of those facts are a basic right. So if you play within the defined rules of a society that truly supports free speech, and has laws to collect a tax on commerce, this solution fits nicely, as the tax collectors will collect their appropriate cut. **What this approach prevents is the gov't from controlling your commercial activity and demonstrates the farce of current financial regulation.** The Bitcoin protocol is more fundamentally sound than the current fiat system, has fewer rules, but are more rigid and enforced through math, which means that gov't regulation is unnecessary. In effect, it reveals the only fraud here is the gov't regulations of Bitcoin.

Why would someone need to wait 34 years? Silver moves up and down almost 2% daily. It was a thing of beauty two years ago when it would swing up and down nearly 50 cents daily. Lately, it's hit some very nice low points, which makes it easier to go longer, like that last 12% run up.
You must think that just because I mention depressed silver prices and the deflated dollar that I'm hedging with silver (or bitcoin). As you can tell, I do own silver, but I like the volatility, and these are very tempting lows. And whether you use silver as a hedge against inflation or not, the price seems well out of whack historically. If someone offered you a pure oz silver coin for $20 wouldn't you buy it? And since the market is really spooked with it's own success and breaking records, if someone yells "fire' (or "Europe"), silver could get really exciting again. Probably not a 34 year Big O, but exciting nonetheless.

Where's the mystery? I'm still waiting for the basic "double bounce bottom". Long traders (like myself) won't jump back in until after the second bounce off the "bottom", but every time the chart has dipped, it has pushed a new low. Every time it goes up, it's a sharp recovery. Too sharp and unrealistic. 
I liked the 275 price, but it didn't hang around long enough. It raced back up, but I figured it would settle back down. I like the fact that it's a slower decent this time, but if it drops below 275, or even 290, I will wait longer, looking for a second bounce.

I will tell them about the email I got last month notifying me that my product had shipped. Having not used PayPal for about 6 months, this came as quite a shock. It had my financial details from about 5 years ago, but the buyer and seller were completely unknown to me. First thing was "OH SHIT! Identity theft and/or PP compromised!" I confirmed thoroughly that it wasn't a phishing email and after talking with "Angel" from PP, she eventually admitted that there was an error in their notification system and told me numerous time "I have nothing to fear, nothing to see here, move on." The catch was that I now had an email with all of the buyer's details and seller details. I asked Angel if I should feel safe knowing that my purchase information was to someone else. I sent a warning message to the buyer and seller.

I gather this clause as a pivotal means of collecting taxes. They need a reference to fiat currencies in order to gauge taxable earnings. If your entire "inventory" is bitcoin, for sales and cost of goods sold, then your profit is in bitcoin too, which is inconvenient to computing tax. I don't know that they need to actually convert (convey) the bitcoin to USD, only measure their profit in USD for accounting purposes.
To me, this rule is the most dangerous! It's not that they should avoid any tax, it is that the tax should be payable in bitcoin.
I don't actually think they could enforce this policy, since bitcoin is only an asset class. It should be treated more like a used car business than a financial business. They can't have it both ways, bitcoin is either a currency or an asset. This is why I will likely never convert my bitcoin to fiat. I will only trade, and the trade will always be even, with no profit or loss.

It's been doing this over and over, to the point where the general equities investor sloughs off 10% drops like they were nothing. The same thing but in the other direction for bitcoin, where drops are expected, and when the prices rises, no one expects it to last.

I see, more of the Jukebox approach, just add more quarters.
I want to be able to play a song anywhere at anytime on any device, but I want to conveniently hit the tip button and know that I am paying the artist. Just torrent the music, so there is zero distribution cost for the artist, but create a means of verifying artist identity, like the bitcoin blockchain itself, where my player can guarantee that I'm tipping the artist and not someone phishing with a hacked the MP3 file.
It's basically DRM, but it doesn't prevent me from playing the track, it prevents me from tipping the wrong artist. I don't want the player to "phone home" every time I play a track, but I don't mind it do a certificate check when I hit the tip button.
**Also, I'd be happy to send tips to Grooveshark, if they just posted a bitcoin address.

Because the CC company, Goliath, isn't disputing the purchase took place, they're just trying to satisfy their customer, the CC holder. The Goliaths know they have the merchants, Davids, by the balls, they either take plastic or fail in many cases. Goliath wins on the sale and they make a killing on the chargeback. There is a huge incentive to do chargebacks. It moves the burden to David, who is now guilty until proven innocent. It's now up to David to get Goliath to capitulate, and we all know Goliath has more time, money, paid staff and fine print to wait this out. Meanwhile, they kick David in the balls with the chargeback plus fees, 
and his retort is to give them a picture. Goliath shrugs and indicates they don't have a picture of the CC holder, and that David will need to report this "evidence" to the authorities, etc. Unfortunately, these David and Goliath stories rarely end like the first.

I think articles like this are important, I just think that people writing them at this time in the life cycle of Bitcoin is rather self fulfilling. The massive rush to explore the endless possibilities provided by Bitcoin tech, and be the next cool app, and to be the first-mover, it becomes a race. That race compresses the time line tremendously, and writing articles like this serves only compress it further. It's like write the eulogy for a baby after it gets its first tooth. (pronounced u-googalee).
I understand that you have to ponder points of failure, but overzealous development can hardly be an indicator. There will be many tried and failed ideas, but even those may just be too early for the market and will resurface.
On this, I speak from experience, as I am a failed dot-com survivor. They burned through $14M in 11 months time with nothing to show except some weak IP. It was a streaming video company, just like Netflix, but we were too soon for the market and content providers. Napster was fresh in the minds of providers and they were scared and still clinging to pay-per-view, premium channels and DVD rentals. They were too afraid their digital copies would end up on Napster. Roughly six years later and Netflix launches their streaming services, which was identical to our business model.
So the start-ups will fail, but the viable underlying idea can survive. Just give Bitcoin a chance! Just let it get off the ground some before we start writing obituaries. If the market doesn't support it, it will go away, but for now go with.

I think I got that right. Low price (cause) has reduced mining growth (effect). I don't have to assume they want to "maximize their bitcoin", nor do I care why they've reduced mining (direct purchasing), nor do I have to speculate on their mining motivations; all point to the same effect of reduced mining.
I *do know* that someone must be highly motivated to mine, especially now that it requires specialized equipment. They're motivated by a mix of passion, greed, interest and maybe some altruism. So if the faithful miners aren't feeling it, how can you expect the rest of the market (speculators) to jump on board.
We haven't seen a negative difficulty slide in recent times, so I don't think they are turning equipment off (yet), they're just not adding new hash power.
I'm certainly not going to rush out and buy some coins if the bitcoin clergy are still backing off. If we see an uptick in hash rate, I'll be more than happy to chuck some fiat.

First, I like the well though out argument and the way you presented it. I would have to largely agree, but I think it only applies to people with hodler positions. I think the "useful" segment of Bitcoin participants, those using and not holding, are growing and that's why we see the price dropping. The exchanges have made it much easier to use bitcoin only when you need it, rather than hodling it, and risk fluctuations.
Of course, you don't have to be a pure hodler or user, and one could argue which there are more of. Of those that are hodlers that evangelize heavily, you could definitely classify them MLM'ers. Then again, I'm a hodler, I evangelize heavily, but I do it so that my friends don't miss out on the benefits, as I don't encourage them to hold.

Indenting paragraphs, like double space after periods has long been retired. There must be additional space though to contrast with line spacing.
Paragraphs were indented because extra spacing would have required more leading work (as in the periodic element), as it was much easier to just shift the characters to the right and keep the lines equal spaced.
Granted, OPs document doesn't have a clear enough distinction between line spacing and paragraph spacing. The kerning is also crap. I'd knock a few points off for poor presentation, esp. since it's so easy to do (or fix) today.

Is this competing or comparing? Is it even a parody?
If a competitor solely alters the advert, replacing components their details, that is copyright infringement.
If you solely alter their advert, injecting your own satire, it is a parody that falls under fair use.
If you create clearly different content, while posting their unaltered original, to compare/contrast your competitive edge, this is fair use.
You can have a mix of the later two, by making a parody of their advert and a comparison, it could be considered fair use, but I think it diminishes the impact. It could arguably expose you to copyright, if it isn't first clearly a parody.
Unfortunately they grey area caused by copyright/fair use requires arbitration, and most hosting companies aren't in the business of arbitrating. So when they get a take down request, it's easier to comply by exercising their right to reject any content they deem unfit.

I concur with the other, you're a gambler. Period. Get help.
Now, my advice. From your other comment, it appears you have $50K left.
Don't gamble anymore. Stop.
Tell your family of your mistakes. This will relieve your stress, restore some credibility, and give the family the opportunity to cope with the loss.
Let the family decide what to do with the remainder.
As for the bitcoin "investment", if the family wants out, let them sell their portion if they like.
If you can live without the "investment", leave it in bitcoin. You chose a long position, then stick with your plan. you're in for the long haul. Unfortunately, plunking down $50K a pop clearly indicates that this will be very hard for you to do.
You must consider your bitcoin money lost, which should've been your initial mindset. If the price recovers, get out and stay out. You didn't win, you did it wrong, and just consider yourself lucky.
This isn't the end of the world. You're human and we're not perfect. All you've done is squander opportunity for your family, so you owe them. You must do your best to make it right for them, because that's all you can do. Just think of it as your purpose in life. Some people don't even have that.

The stick in place (pinning) is a behavior I added, if you click-drag and then hold still a moment before you release. If you click and nudge the node, it will release.
Initially, I anchored the buttons, but it spoiled to look. The gravity/forces pulled the nodes into a more oval pattern.

More important than going negative, is that it's [part of a trend, where the computational rate has arced over.]( I think it means equilibrium in market price and mining (including speculation/gambling). The loyal order of bitcoin brethren, who have been mining with fervor, have likely saturated their "inventory" and sold their extras, but to continue mining and selling extras doesn't pay the bills. In the short term, we could see another drop due to excess supply, but any upturn will return to a moon trajectory.

Thanks for the explanation. Next question: if the line represents 12 and 24 month returns, how is it that there isn't a 12 or 24 month gap at either the beginning or end? For example, if the graph represents the end return, where the amount shown on 8/19 represent a theoretical purchase 12 months earlier, then the beginning of the graph would be skewed because there wouldn't be any data for 12 months. Or visa versa, if the graph represent the return as of date of purchase, then the end of the graph would lack data, since we can't see 12 months into the future (yet). Does this explained why the graph is flat recently?

Could this be the source of OP's confusion? Too many wallet options?
Also, buying from coinbase and then moving them to a personal wallet should be considered protocol, but this concept likely seems very foreign. It would be like buying something and the cashier doesn't hand you back your change, rather he puts it in a wallet and then gives you the wallet. You then move then contents to your own wallet, and then you (should) never use their wallet anywhere else. Why can't we just give them a deposit address from our personal wallet?
I ran into this same BS with localbitcoins... Why do I need to create another (expletive) wallet with them? I'm certainly not going to use it to make an exchange.

[As I predicted]( 11 days ago when we someone got excited about the 10% recovery (that run up to $450).
Of course, it could drop well below $325, which would invalidate my prediction, which is very likely.
If the miners push the difficulty up again, I predict we easily plunge to $250. [Reasoning]( And seeing that the hash rate just broke a new record high moments ago, means the difficulty will likely be going up, so look for more downward travel.

The difficulty acts a governor on the introduction of new coins, effectively the supply rate, and not the overall supply in the market. Yes, the difficulty works up or down on a short term period, but the point is the difficulty value becomes an indicator as to where the miners are at.
With the 1% daily growth rates we've seen, a flat line means people aren't turning on new machines. This means existing miners are running their existing equipment and potential players are taking a wait and watch. Since miners are a vested lot, real optimistic believers, and they've slowed/stopped growth, then I wouldn't expect the open market (personal or institutional inventories) to take the lead and buy more (and shrink inventories, drive prices up, etc.)
If someone thinks that flat production means a shrinking supply and higher prices, I think it's jumping the gun. There's no telling how deep the miner inventories are, or how eager new prospectors are to risk capital. But if we see the hash rate continue to rise, driving up the difficultly again, then we know at least the bitcoin faithful (or VC types) are pouring real value into the network.

I've got my own interesting answer, but it may not be possible; don't convert your bitcoin to $US. Rather, you should trade for goods and services. Bitcoins have been declared a commodity/asset class by the IRS, which means you must treat it as a stock, bond, physical gold, etc. Everyone initially thinks this is bad and will prevent bitcoin from being a currency. I think it will work out OK.
You see, if you purchased your BTC for $1US and sold it for $10US, the IRS will tax as $9US capital gain. But when you trade for goods or services, it is a NET TRADE. If you trade your 1BTC for a television set (assume used) there is no USD associated with the price, and therefore an even trade. You agreed with the seller that the TV was worth 1BTC and therefore no increase or decrease in your net worth in USD.**
The IRS could attempt to quote market value of a BTC at the time of sale, or the fair market value of the TV, but it would a loosing argument because you could argue that you bought the TV on sale, well below market.**
Give it a little thought, and you could likely show huge losses on paper. Just be sure to document your "bad" trades. If you do well (poor) enough, you could end up writing off some losses against other investment income.**
Akin to Uncle Jimbo and Ned yelling "It's coming right for us!" before shooting the deer, be sure to write "It was scratched, so it was heavily discounted" on the receipt.**
But if you "trade" BTC for dollars, you're on their turf (ledger).

The key point here is flaunt it, but never bring it up as a topic of conversation. Pretend it's Fight Club if that helps you.

A small business doesn't have to outrun a Fortune 500 company, it just has to outrun other small businesses, and it might be faster access to capital through Counterparty that gives me the edge. Kickstart and the like might be a great start, but the ongoing trades will certainly need a different vehicle.

I've been waiting to see the effect of lowering price on mining. This might be the first time in a long time that mining crests, as the estimated difficulty level is currently less than the last difficulty level. It's been a long time since this has happened. Although, it might not go down, because we are in a naturally low part of the mining swing. The next 2-3 days will be telling. If the difficultly doesn't go up, or even goes down, then we will know that we are at a point where mining isn't worth it, which might be a sign of a lower bound.

I like the argument that you give, but I have a more fundamental perk; security! I don't have to give them any financial data. I'll pay 1% for that. I can give them a mailing address; not even a name is required. As a merchant, I know they will start giving discounts. If you are a merchant and have the prospect of no charge back costs or you can avoid the hassle of chain-link and razor wire required to store CC details, you'd tender 1% to bitcoin users. My small business will offer 3% discount for bitcoin.
Also, I heard an interview with Overstock CEO, when asked if it was risky to accept the volatile bitcoins, he responded that they convert the bitcoins to fiat, and then he smirked and made the comment "well, up to 90% of the bitcoins to cover costs". So it sounds like they might be keeping their margins in bitcoin. Tax strategy?

Bullish? Not yet. I think it's a trailing indicator, telling us that miners have filled their private coffers (hodling), have sold as much inventory as they can tolerate at these prices and are now shutting down equipment. This will reduce supply, but there's a glut. Miners aren't going feel like hodling more, and speculators aren't going to buy until supply shrinks.
**The question is, with production flat or negative, how deep are the mined inventories?** I would see a return to [+1% daily growth]( as the bullish sign. Of course, the general public could get excited again and inhale those inventories.

The competition is undercutting Bitcoin. They are printing and giving away vast quantities, but only to the big players that can promise their loyalty (e.g. pre-IPO shares to BABA at $68 and the market opens at $85). The competition has well established methods of distribution (and dilution). Bitcoin is adjusting its value to compete, but the difference with Bitcoin is that all boats truly rise and fall together.

I didn't say everyone doesn't get screwed. It does create a silent tax through inflation where everyone looses a significant value of their dollar, quietly. It's the fact that they don't physically print money, they just make a few journal entries that magically erase a banks bad debt, which clears them to make more loans, increasing circulation.
You're correct about the wealth transfer, that's why it's also called the ignorance tax, or stupid tax. That is because most people don't know the effect of inflation. Even my in-laws, a few years back whilst complaining about loosing 15-20% in their market investments, they didn't realize they had lost 50% of their value due to printing. In a three year span the gov't had practically double the supply of money.
They play their inflation game by narrowing the number of commodities that are tracked as a measure of inflation. Kind of like the way they've narrowed the definition of *unemployed* so that it doesn't include the *underemplolyed* and no-longer-looking. This way the gov't can say there's no inflation, nothing to see here people, move on. It's amazing how many daily items aren't included in the inflation index because, get this, "they're too volatile and fluctuate too much". Isn't that the point of having an index! Of course by narrowing the index, the gov't need only put the fix in for a few sectors.

I don't normally write AMEN comments, but yours deserves it. I might add to your point, that along with "fixed money supply" it is a closed loop system. Perhaps a better way to say it is a "fixed rules system", where we know the rules of bitcoin, and **the rules allow feedback to work the way it should.**
Most systems employing capitalism fail because some bureaucrat (Fed Res) thinks they know better and can "make adjustments" in lending rates, QE(n) or bail out select industries. With the transparency afforded by the blockchain (ledger) the "self-stabilizing effect" actually gets a chance to work.

The whole point for me and micro-tipping is that I want to feel free to tip whatever I feel at that moment. I'd like people to feel the same, but I'm not going to demand they do the same.
The key for me is I don't want to ever keep a mental ledger of how much I've tipped any one person or organization. Take music for instance, if I hear a song again that I like, I want to hit a button and BOOM a small tip! I don't want to stop and think, "Hmmm, let's see, I've given them a $1.50, should I tip more?" I want a button on my player (radio) that I can hit when I hear a great song and know that the artist and station get a hit.
I think we need one more incremental change in tipping, which is the single button push. This way, just as people hit the up-arrow, folks can leave a tip. Then 500 people leaving 1 or 10 cents won't seem like an insult.

I'd rather see a service that played songs with official bitcoin registrations embedded (no phishing). That way, on my player I could designate a micro-tip, say one dime, and if I hear a song I like, I can just hit the tip button (and verify), and the artist gets tipped. Then later, when I hear it again, and still like the song, I can one-button tip again. I want it to be fractional, so I don't have to remember if I tipped them already, if I still like the song when I hear it a week or year later, BAM! hit the tip button. That is what bitcoin is for (or some alt-artist-coin to keep the micro-tips off the main blockchain).

I think the volatility is required and should be expected. Not because it will necessarily skyrocket because of new adopters or speculators, but because it is the only feedback mechanism built in the system. Unlike other monetary systems that try to shield users from currency value shifts by printing or printing at different lending rates, or shifting balances to another ledger, or bail outs and other "stimulation", bitcoin will shift in value related to all other items.
Case in point is the hyper deflation argument given a fixed supply of money. If people horde, the value will climb, perhaps so high that no one uses as a currency, but at some point, it will saturate and reverse course. These could be violent moves early on, but as it holds true to system rules, and let the system work, it will steady. And when it does steady, just be prepared for another roller coaster.

Actually, I've been watching the hash rate closely, hoping to see what how the value and adoption are affected by any sort of tapering in the rate. Just when the exponential growth rate starts to taper, it explodes again. The running average is 1% daily growth, which is utterly amazing, but at the same time concerning that anything could maintain that pace. In simple terms, that means the hash is doubling every 72 to 90 days. What happens to bitcoin adoption, and value of course, when this does taper? Without this daily "inflation", will we start to see the feared hyper-deflation? I know the difficulty factor makes a great governor on real bitcoin inflation, but it doesn't throttle the bitcoin hype.

I quite agree, it shouldn't be feared, but we've never had the opportunity to explore life with deflation. In the past, would have it occurred, it was always too tempting to run the printing presses (faster than they can on the inflationary side of the curve).

For my two cents, we are currently living in a bizarro world, where inflation is running rampant and yet silver/gold is reaching new 52 week lows this morning. The financial puppeteers have tapped all the tricks in their bag. Corporations are sitting on the largest pile of cash.

The ETF would be just as susceptible as all others with regards to the paper (declaration, loopholes, minimums, etc.) that form ETFs, but the backing asset (bitcoin) would more stable, with its limited supply. I trade in silver and gold ETFs and not only do you have fiat price volatility, you have supply (mining) volatility. Primarily, there's no measure of total supply.

Is this exclusive to bitcoin, because its success is dependent on the mass effect, or has someone like, say Warren Buffet, been called a Whale, or more explicitly a BearWhale?

I agree with your premise, but the "I don't know any..." statement doesn't exactly describe the whole marketplace. I think he did a good job in the article describing how the market wants the equilibrium, but in the start up phase, there is a push-pull effect when the system is launching. I liken it to the effect freight cars have when a train starts off, where a rail car is pulled by the car in front at times and push by the car behind, as the length of cars develop momentum.

Executive Summary:
* call bitcoin "digital cash"
* spin cash as inefficient (wtF?)
* bitcoin users want to remain anonymous which implies "suspicious" activity
* spin message to appear MC is going to "move beyond cash" through trust (sorry, I just threw up a little there)
Witness the double speak: "85% of the world's retail transactions are cash", yet spins "combat the inefficiencies of cash and create a much more transparent and inclusive financial system." Last I checked, my cash still worked, was extremely efficient and wasn't broken because of anonymity.
What I find really encouraging is that 85% figure. I would've thought that credit transactions were much greater, but this is their figure and represents their competitor (cash). **This means that the technology that most closely resembles cash, will be the winner. Since MC can't/won't replicate the anonymity aspect, they will ultimately lose.**

Micro-donations! This is my biggest Bitcoin dream come true! Being able to simply point my phone at an address (confirm it matches) tap in my donation and done! That feeling that you're doing some good and knowing that VISAMASTERCARDPAYPAL doesn't get a dime! The donation can be small so that I can tip/donate at whim and know that I'm not risking a huge amount if it were a fraudulent address.
To make this easier, I'd like a wallet/app with an option explicitly for donations with a single button push. The amount is fixed so I don't accidental fat-finger a decimal point. Recommendations?
Also, I know a QR can contain an amount, but can it also contain a note? That way my donation app could automatically record the cause. Currently, I have to edit the address book. I'm using the Schildbach bitcoin wallet app.

An *embrace and destroy* maneuver from PayPal was my first reaction, but *trojan horse* works too.

Yes, this is the game! Notice that the US has "tapered" its printing, only to have the Japanese a couple of weeks ago start printing, and now the ECB.
You see, it's now their turn. Nations are playing round-robin limbo with their curreny... "how low can we go?". The US prints, which devalues the USD(FRN), which sweetens exports, which bumps manufacturing and the economy (stops the hemorrhage). The US pulls back and it's Japan's and Europe's turn to devalue their currency. Remember, they don't really print money, they simply have the right hand paying off the left hand to write off bad debt. Is China next in line? I think Russia makes a stink when they get overlooked in these manufactured "recoveries".
Rinse and repeat.

I Agree. I wouldn't say PayPal started like that, it wanted quite a bit for the confirmation. You didn't have to confirm, but if you wanted to do anything useful, it was required.
A better example might be Prosper. I signed up early on and it was good. Then all of a sudden they suspended operations as they got the attention of the Feds, spurred on by their competitors, the banks. Then it was photo of D/L, proof of this and proof of that.

Wow, you took some hits on this opinion! I'm looking for the right word to describe your paradox, but only ironic comes to mind. **Your attempt to make a point about the ineffectiveness of using technical minutia in marketing got panned because it wasn't technically accurate.**
They aren't marketing bitcoin as much as they are evangelizing bitcoin. Marketing looks for sympathetic means of triggering an emotional connection with the mark, whereas evangelism sets out to persuade an audience through reasoning and passion.
I have to agree that most of the articles and youtube references have been evangelism, where they have to explain all these new terms in the lexicon (digital currency, crypto, ledger, etc.). It's like a competition to unlock the hipster achievement by coining the next buzz word (sorry for the pun there). I don't ever recall getting this education for e-mail... "there's this SMTP protocol that attempts to deliver you message...". I don't want to know how the sausage is made.
So, on the one hand I agree with you about the marketing tact, but on the other hand I don't think it needs any marketing at all. No one, sans AOL, had to market email, so why market at all? **I think we should just STFU and play hard-to-get.**

If you bought into Bitcoin because you thought it was ready, then that was a mistake.
2. There's no difference with fiat currency. Just look at the spread between the *haves* and *have nots*. There are those that understand the rules of the game, embrace the concepts and prosper. As far as I'm concerned, I'm not sure I want everyone to show up and play. Eventually they will, as economics and human nature will dictate. Until then, **I want to enjoy the benefits of this new tech and work/play among those that understand it.**

I agree the hard "cash" deposit is a turn-off. It is one of those things we forget that a CC does. The CC company has extended their funds as a guarantee, and the B&amp;B accepts the CC ability to cover that guarantee. This is apparently a dependency that works more often than not.
I wonder if it would be acceptable to show that the wallet used to fund the stay has enough bitcoin to cover the deposit? It would be like paying cash, and flashing them a couple hundred bucks you have in your wallet to demonstrate that you're good for it. I think in the end, if there were a way to demonstrate past payment performance (debit record or cash record), perhaps vendors would extend short term credit. Of course, this runs counter to the privacy aspect of bitcoin, but I think we will people use both public and private wallets.

Inflation and taxes are the same thing. The difference is tax is forthright, whereas inflation is silent and subversive. **Inflation is a tax on ignorance and apathy, because those that don't understand the impact of inflation are those directly affected by it.** Those that understand it, or can afford to take measures to offset it, recognize it early on and are usually the first to raise the prices. Inflation usually trickles down to the consumer, when their dollar can no longer buy essentials.
Key example, is the shrink-n-grow in food packaging. Packages shrink in net weight to avoid price shocks, and then grow (50% more!) to justify price increases. A classic inflation distraction technique. My wife and I have noted that the ice cream net volume has shrank for the third time this year, each time about 1/10th of a liter.

If it is a USD for stamp and back to USD, then you would be liable for tax on the difference in USD, although if time had passed, you could prove that the gain in dollars was due to inflation.
To really complicate things, what if you used a collectible $5 bill that had a market value of $20? Could you write off the loss against other income?
That's why I think when the transaction doesn't involve any USD, simply BTC to *asset* and back to BTC, **there is no gain.** Since the IRS has declared BTC an asset, it is an asset-to-asset exchange. If I have a car, trade it for a boat, and then trade that boat for another car, there's no gain, even if I think the second car is worth more. I can simply state the original car was only worth $1, which then means I only value the boat for $1, and eventually the next car at $1, so there is simply no gain and no tax. To avoid any misunderstandings, each bill of sale would have no mention of USD (currently known as FRNs).

I agree on the need for full disclosure. Why would it be kept secret? An obscure answer might be to minimize the endorsement of bitcoin in general. To me, the sale of bitcoin for Fed Res Notes is a **major milestone with huge implications**. An official branch (executive/law enforcement) of the gov't just validated bitcoin by exchanging official currency. Even if the coins sold at half their market value, these coins are invaluable compared to all before it.
So, if you're the agency that just lent credibility to bitcoin, you might want to keep the splash to a minimum. What message does this send to all holders of FRN (USD), foreign and domestic? I doubt they want to yell from on high that their national currency is only worth 1/650th of some upstart, infant virtual (read: better) currency. There are consequences when any Federal agency sets monetary precedence. That effect is not limited to the Fed Reserve.

Yes, been waiting! I consider this the next required step before next run up. In fact, I'd like to see two consecutive negative adjustments, if not some clearly flat entries. We've seen a few flat ones, which has been good.
To me, it represents an equilibrium with price and mining ROI (managed production), and mining's lottery effect (speculative production). It may also indicate saturation of hashing technology. The point is, that we are finally seeing [the exponential curve start to arc](
It has flirted with closing with a negative difficulty four times now, but each time near the end it has managed some growth, so we will see. We are only half way through this run. I've seen it recover the climb within the last 15%.
If it shows little growth or negative, I have a "trailing buy" on this run down (to $300 hopefully).
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:01:34
Supply-demand is correct, as a root cause. I was looking for something used to gauge the effects of too much supply. To much supply, the price certainly falls, but are the miners the first or last to react to the oversupply. Seeing as how they're the primary input, I suspect they will be the governor on supply and begin reducing it when it is no longer cost effective to mine (putting aside the gambling factor). I'd say this is likely to make them the last to react to oversupply. In other words, they've put the machines in place and are willing to let them run so long as they can break even (or at a deficit if they're gambling). 
Setting aside the multiplicative effects of speculators, if the miners are sitting on more coin than their comfortable hodling and they aren't cost effective to sell, we will see mining taper. As long as that condition exists then a speculator isn't going to hodl either.

I will say that this, at the least, always makes for a great story line. I guess the part I find it hard to believe is the need to be so clandestine.

This might be the first time since the $1K peak that the mining difficulty will actually drop. *Could this confirm bitcoin pricing is clearly in the "Despair" portion of the chart?*
Approximately 5 days remain before the next difficulty adjustment. With less than 40% of the blocks remaining in this series, this is the longest stretch where a difficulty decrease has loomed. Might this indicate that the miners don't like this low price and that they've **hit some equilibrium where mining isn't worth it.**
This would make for a clear indication that bitcoin pricing has entered the *Despair* portion segment. If that were true, then we won't see the price turn and climb until the projected difficulty resumes climbing. I wouldn't buy until we see some equilibrium (or bottom) in mining and pricing.
So will the miners pull off another amazing reversal within 5 days and continue pushing the difficulty upwards? They did so about 60 days ago, but it was comfortably achieved and went on to set some record leaps. If the difficulty is moved higher this round, I think the price will continue to drop, as it signals that the miners think the price is still worth it, and that they haven't entered the *Despair* portion, which will keep the investors/speculators/hodlers in the *Fear-Capitulation* sector as **they keep looking for some bottom signal.**

Correct, at the time you wrote your comment, they only had about 18 hours before the difficulty adjusts and offsets their surge. On the other hand, I think all miners in general may have thinned their inventories and are now turning up the hashes.

This reminds me of when my first boss taught me a VERY important tactic in negotiation: always start with a ridiculous offer. If they are asking $100 you offer them $20. He said, "What's the worst thing that will happen when you make this ridiculous offer? They will laugh at you. But that offer has just made it clear to them that they are not going to get any where near $100." You've staked your position, much like NYDFS. 
NYDFS has made a ridiculous offer, knowing full well they won't get it all, but they made it very clear they will being playing a big role. The only way to counter this is to make a ridiculous counter offer to let them know they won't get what they want.
The question is who has the stronger position? I think bitcoin does, as it is an inherently disruptive technology. My feeling is that if Bitcoin needed any regulation, it would be part of the protocol, and the reason bitcoin is so successful is that it doesn't include extraneous rules. If needed, the community will adapt the protocol to solve any *real* problems the NYDFS regulation is trying to solve.

**I like micro-tipping and I will tip when and wherever I feel like it.** I'm going to make a few converts, I'm going to make someones day, and I'm going to feed a few pigeons. Some will think "manna from heaven" and others will think "what pitiful amounts", but I'm going to feel good about it. That's the beauty of micro-tipping, the amount by itself is insignificant. Tipping isn't altruistic in the slightest.
This isn't a high risk investment. I don't have to make a mental note of whether or not I've tipped this person already. If I hit some mental threshold to give, I tip. 
If someone comes along and can weave the false tale that causes me to tip and maybe a few others, then shame on them. But, if that was their intent and they spent the effort on the con, then they were rewarded. It certainly isn't a noble cause, but even a rats gotta eat. It's a micro-tip... yawn.

No, there's no telling how many of those were programmed buys, people that had a buy order sitting there that was triggered. You'll always get a frenzy with large price movements, so volume is a fickle indicator. Most of the trade action on a dip is called "feeding the bears". I just don't like the pattern where every low is followed by a bump, only to strike a new record low. I'd just like to see two lows, the second low not breaking lower than the first (and both will be active trade, the second maybe not as much as the first). If we touched 300-325 again and start a rise, I might call that a bottom (and consider the 275 price an overshoot of the bottom). If it bounces off of 280-300, they will feed this bear again. I'm also watching mining closely, as I like the fact that the hashrate growth rates are tapering some.

I think it touches at or near 275 again, then a clear rise. Otherwise if it drops below, like 250, then we have a long wait for the next bottom, or two. The miners have backed off, we've seen a peak in the hashrate, and a recession in the difficulty. So supply (growth) has tapered off (and negative short term). But will this shrinking supply spur demand? When the hash rate rises and the price rises, in that order, you can assume there is demand for new supply.

Comparing the two seems a far stretch, but if you look at the prescribed root cause of the commodities price shift (namely silver), it's the accelerating increase in the value of the dollar. If you apply this to the price of bitcoin, it too should be dropping, but isn't, which could imply that the value of bitcoin is rising with the rise in the dollar.
I think both commodities are under pressures specific to their market. The Swiss won't be buying silver, and OPEC is trying to bully the market. Still, it will be interesting to see what the Fed will do to kill the dollar's growing strength. More "printing" likely to dilute the value.

It is no accident that they must devalue the currency. That's why they always use the word "consumers". If people aren't spending money, the markets panic. The gov't, primarily those states with sales taxes, REALLY panics! No spending, no taxes.
What I like is the fact that people will naturally stop buying crap, like cheap chinese crap at the dollar store or checkout stand. Instead, they will get smarter and buy something once. This will save on landfills. They will slowly shift their mindset away from "I might as well buy it today because tomorrow my dollar will be worth less (or worthless).

TIL, it wasn't even suppose to be called a dime. Also the nickel has a crap load of history. I didn't know they made a three-cent coin! It was the inspiration for the nickel, and was made from copper and nickel. The penny's official name is "cent". The slang was adopted from the British.
It appears the masses don't have a problem with nicknames, but I'm sure it will drive the technical purists nuts. Some celeb or hipster will undoubtedly pick the name.

I agree with your points and as means to segue into mainstream use, yet I think adoption is inevitable and won't need much assistance. Just the sheer amount of propagating innovation built on Bitcoin is astounding.
I'm a bit disappointed in how bitcoin can't support true microtrxs, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Kind of like gold doesn't make a great currency. Namely the 3 to 5 cent mining fee can be significant when compared to 10 cent tip. Also, a 10 cent tip doesn't need to be recorded in the blockchain public ledger of all time. In short, a tip can be forgotten within a month, and ideally it should be forgotten. The amount is also insignificant, so the liability hardly requires the security of private key.
I offer that a solution could be built around the concept of an IOU or personal ledger of outstanding payments. Rather than record a bitcoin exchange, an IOU is created containing the target address and the amount. These would be collected to either an amount limit (credit) or the due date. Then, perhaps on the first of the month, all of the IOUs are settled up with one bitcoin transaction with multiple addresses. In this mode, this could be a completely standalone app, or an option added to any wallet.
It's like changetip, which is a great system for tipping, but changetip needs to gather and hold your bitcoins up front and they must become an ongoing account with security and a ledger, and yet one more place to create a wallet. With the IOU approach, it only keeps the ledger long enough to pay off the IOUs, and it merely works with your current wallet to formulate the batch payment.
At first, this might only work tips and donations, but it will save users money on these microtrxs. At some point, it could become popular to take IOUs, like running a tab at a bar, and then settle up. This would require an on-line service, but it would provide other services too. Other benefits could include building a credit worthiness score, real loans, pay all your bills in one shot, rewards programs, etc.
All of this would be done without the IOU system making yet another wallet and private key. At some point in time the IOU system creates the necessary bitcoin transaction to pay off the IOUs, all of the addresses get paid with one small mining fee (0.05%), and the IOUs can be discarded at will.

False choice. It's difficult, and eventually impossible, for a "real" insurance company to compete with a gov't that can print money.
Since everyone is playing ProTip cards: pay cash for your healthcare!
We do, and we get between a 20 and 50% discount! These discounts aren't due to public support programs either, as they offer them but we refuse and just pay cash. To further make the point, *these are discounts off the balance*, but the balance is also greatly trimmed, sometimes halved as well. If it isn't clear yet, you will quickly find out how many fewer charges they put on your bill! If you have larger medical bills, they just put you on a payment plan. Gee, just like they did long ago, in the before time.

Personal experience: watched BTCChina intently Q1 last year and there was definitely a lot of bot trades. There were definite signs of 2-3 bots, or a single bot trading 2-3 patterns, as trades executed in definite predicable patterns and you could set your watch by them. This only leaves the question of who was running the bot. It's likely that anyone could fire one up and play on BTCChina since there was no charge per trade.

I like to think that most here, including myself, are intelligent folks. (And no, you really didn't leave that aside. Hey, did you just use blatant demagoguery and manipulation?).


Yes and no. You don't need gov't to execute those services, but you need a gov't to manage those services and collect taxes to pay for those collective services. I agree though, the services themselves should be provided by the private sector.


Since effective spending means different things to different people, it can be difficult (near impossible) to form a consensus. This alone would make it impossible to "vote" for every expenditure to run a community. Hence, we vote for ("hire") public employees, charged with the task of executing the will of the people. Unfortunately, the current method of accountability (spending and management) has little or no incentives to create/improve efficiency.

The point: I'm just trying to confirm n8u's "yet people in this subreddit" remark, as I'm one of those that would offer testimony that I've seen fake trades, as I consider bot action "fake", as in synthetic. I didn't imply it was limited to 2-3, I only claimed to distinguish 2 or 3 high volume bot patterns a year ago. There could very well be thousands now, esp. since it's been over a year. I also didn't indicate bots were limited to BTCChina, only that they had a low, or no cost trade, which meant BTCChina would be a big playground for bots. The only ambiguity (and implication) was whether or not BTCChina was running its own bot to inflate trade volumes for bragging rights (artificial mass effect).

**The new ease of tipping requires recalibration in tipping habits, and why micro-tipping is a better approach.**
Those that have preached that tips less than $1 are an insult are still thinking in terms of the physical world, where the audience is much more restricted in size. On the Internet, where the audience is magnitudes greater, smaller tips will add up. It also exposes people to more fraud, as it seems easier to do. Micro-tipping reduces the exposure of any one person, offseting the exposure/ease of fraud.

I agree that it is best to orbit away from political talk, but only because it is too natural to conjoin the two. It does seem to many the "silver bullet" to many political problems making it all to tempting. It is an easy tune to play that your peers know and understand. I think it becomes inevitable because you can't escape the social implications. Certainly, sticking it to the corrupt to-big-to-fail institutions is motivating, but ultimately politics and bitcoin will lock horns when it comes to taxes. At some point, as society adopts the better method of wealth transfer (bitcoin) society will insist the social coffers are filled. We all know that **politics will decide how this bounty is spent to "keep us safe and secure"**, and, of course, how much we are to contribute.

I'm leaning toward a "RAID" approach, or RAIK, going with a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Keys, dividing the bitcoins into smaller "denominations" over a larger number of private keys and I can't do that effectively when they're $119 each.

I agree with your liquidity argument as a required increase in bitcoin value, but not as a cause, but as an effect. Bitcoin will achieve 100x to 1000x in value as an effect of use as a currency, rather than become a currency caused by a 100x to 1000x increase in value. I think it is the indistinguishable swing between the two that contributes to volatility during adoption.
I would say too that I don't agree with your follow up 3 points and the conclusion. Small businesses love innovation and opportunity and your points seem to ignore this.
1. small business folks will speculate (albiet sometimes to a fault)
2. they may not see a transaction early on, but that won't stop them from casting a net (a cheap and easy net I might add!)
3. small businesses like any and all transactions, esp. ones that act like cash
Sure, bitcoin will have to be magnitudes greater in value to actually replace any fiat currencies, but that's the plan.
What I didn't get from your comment was whether or not you thought bitcoin would become a viable or competitive currency? I read your comment as a negative.
Full disclosure, I'm a small businessman, and I will be offering a bitcoin payment option to my customers. I will also offer a 3 to 5% discount if they pay with bitcoin, as this will offset the current merchant account rates and fixed costs.

I'll have to look into what data is available about age/qty of unconfirmed. It would be funny to add intensified drama ques, like they do in modern video games.
I've noted on reddit before, but the amazing thing is the constant flow nowadays. When I wrote the code over a year ago, I had to also write a mock data stream to simulate transactions in order to hurry along debugging. The actual stream was so slow, it was taking me 10+ minutes to test new features. Now it hits the 300 node threshold within ~~a minute~~ 30 seconds!

What's really bad is when PayPal sent me notice of a transaction that wasn't even mine! I thought it was some phishing scam, but it had my # and name, so I thought someone hacked my account since I hadn't used it in nearly a year. It had my account header but a completely different buyer and seller. Apparently they had a bug in their notice that had an overlap in transaction ids. Like you said, I now had everything but their SSN. The PayPal CSR tried to shrug it off as no big deal. I replied, "I bet if I asked Deborah or Gloria if it were no big deal, I'd get a different answer." I sent them both an email notifying them of PayPal's mistake, seeing as how I had their email addresses.

Already scoured your site before asking. You're a fool to think EliptiBox replaces something as simple as a Ledger Wallet (L/W).
I see them as **two different tools for two different jobs**. The complex h/w wallets will replace the role of banks, and simple devices like L/W will handle walking around money. Also, because EliptiBox will be relatively expensive, it will mean you must store all your bitcoin in one location, but **commodity priced h/w like L/W allows for multi-key solutions** and spreading risk to multiple devices.
The L/W could certainly benefit from a secure device like EliptiBox, acting as a secure programmer. The major drawback of L/W is the need to setup the device on a secure computer (clean room). EliptiBox has the facilities to fulfill the role of bank, e.g. account management, whereas commodity hardware like L/W fulfills the role of a small account, or traditional wallet with walking around money. **To put it succinctly, I'm not going to buy my kids an EliptiBox so they can dispense their lunch money.**
**EliptiBox has all of the components necessary to fulfill the role of a clean room.** To put it another way, if L/W didn't exist today, it would have eventually been a great natural add-on for EliptiBox. EliptiBox should be sold as a "secure clean room used to program your security tokens". In fact, if I were you folks, I would be signing a pact with L/W right now!
Also, in my opinion, I hate the name EliptiBox. It says nothing to me about security. It's hard to type. The "box" part degrades the value, e.g. my cat uses a box. Don't get me wrong, I love your product idea, and there will be a niche for it. You've got a lot of tech in a small device, I just hate to see you naively narrow your use cases.

Honest opinion: not sure I'd call it art. I would classify it as a simple illustration. It's largely factual and unimaginative, striking neither emotive or empathetic reaction. Someone called it iconography, but it barely makes that grade, as it requires explanation to the viewer (e.g. it's not a joke if you have to explain the punch line). And finally, as a general graphic, it lacks flare (wow factor). On a more generous note, I do like the texture of the acrylic on the canvas.

Is it possible to build into (onto) the "protocol" limits on rate of withdraw? For example, some kind of time-lock where only so many funds could be spent in a day or other rate of spending. So if the private key were exposed, the transaction limit would be hit. It would be really cool if the rate were tied to the number of keys present, then you could have single-key limit, 2-keys limit, 3-keys unlimited. I could give my kids a $20/day limit on their key.

I think this whole discussion about secure vs. insecure hardware brings to light the uneasy feeling about bitcoin and security and why I haven't gotten more invested. I don't like the knowledge gap in wallet security.
I don't want to be some kind of hacker, who might have to understand checksums and circuit layouts to know that I have an authentic device. It would be like going to a boutique shop at the mall and looking at a leather wallet, then wondering if it's some kind of Chinese trap that could be insecure. **Seriously, can you imagine looking at a leather wallet and not knowing if the cash you put in it could be stolen by the wallet maker!**
The terms are that you need to be "sufficiently paranoid" to survive in the computer world, and feel as though I am. Yet when it comes to bitcoin, when there is real hard earned money on the table (or in the wallet), I don't feel qualified.
This seems to be a very asymmetrical problem: the more cash you put in a wallet (higher risk), the more it requires that you trust the developer, manufacturer and distributor of the wallet. So as the risk increases but the trust doesn't, it limits the effectiveness of wallets in general. It's like data storage in general, like building a RAID, where you need to buy multiple disks from multiple vendors in order to spread the risk burden.
This could be the argument for picking up one of these cheap copies, as the effort to spread your risk. Perhaps you keep your larger stashes on Trezors (plural) because of the lower risk quotient, but throw a couple of bits on the cheap copies for walking around money.

I may wait a bit longer. I was waiting for the apex in mining, which came, lasted a couple of months, but the strength of the resurgence has me wondering. This alone looks like it could be the cause of the price drop. Did miner inventories get depleted over the holidays and they are rebuilding?

That's why the average person then shouldn't deal with stocks if they don't understand, but instead look at a managed (mutual) fund or through a financial adviser that can explain it to them.
I would add, that Berkshire H. fund moves up and down in increments of $800 - 1000, while a $25 stock will only move nickels or dimes on an active day of trading. It's relative and therefore they speak in points (percentages). They will generally price in larger denominations to exclude smaller investment portfolios, and target institutional investors.

Just imagine what happens when they immediately follow that with an equal sell order. I like the market contrast, where on Wall Street, this would be prosecuted by the SEC, but under bitcoin it could become common practice. As a result, it will harden the (remaining) participants as they learn to ignore these rush-in-rush-out, pump-n-dump tactics. Can you imagine a marketplace where there are no more easy executed head fakes? Where a mass of buy orders will be met with immediate price increases and mass sell orders are met with skepticism.

Talk about playing on a whole different fiscal level! 1000 bitcoins at $250 is a quarter million. You've got to have some balls to exchange a quarter million on a simple email directive. **Even if the message were crypto signed with God's own key, I'd still have a short face-to-face confab before executing.** Amounts like this would require multiple keys to release, [which reminds me of this War Games clip](
Actually, I wouldn't even keep that amount in a single wallet. I'd spread it over 20 or more wallets, which would make it a more laborious and slow process to execute. This is why protocols often implement framing with ACK packets and some kind of parity checks.

You must define crash. Is it the value of the USD to other global currencies, or is it the USD vs commodities?
Every country is taking the US lead and killing their currency. It's a race to the bottom, to "print" money and dilute their currency, to increase the int'l appetite for their exports. So each nation is attempting to "crash" their currency. This has created a dangerous game of chicken.
At some point, individuals (middle-lower class) and small businesses will stop burdening the quiet tax of inflation and recalibrate the cost of their labor. This will exacerbate inflation. This is a dollar-commodity crash.
Once there is push back from the general masses, the nations will wish their currency wasn't worth less, or worthless. Social services will teeter on collapse because it will be easier to live on perpetual unemployment than to find a job (funemployment). Gov'ts' only recourse is to start "printing" to pay for social programs and the unfunded liabilities on the balance sheet.
The macro-decision to "print" will trigger spiraling inflation in commodities, as folks discover the huge value gap between equities (stocks) and commodities (food,water,shelter,oil). This striking difference will make it abundantly clear that the Haves only have fiats and ledgers, while the Havenots supply/produce the commodities. This will be the crash, as the Haves will rush to buy commodities before their equities become worthless. How much wheat will your Facebook stock certificate buy?
What I want to know is why we didn't collapse yesterday or last year? I could spend the whole day creating a list of the reasons why it will crash, but I'm hard pressed to define why it hasn't. Perhaps people are currently content with their station in life.

I've owned a PO box for years, but long ago, in the before time, they passed a law requiring strict details of owners. I recall this, because I had owned the box for years when the requirement for more identity was delivered with a treat of closure.
I don't recall what they demanded, but I do recall it angered me greatly, especially since I'd used the box for years and still lived at my street address registered with the box, and that alone didn't meet their requirement.

I would add distributed security. Rather than large institutions securing your value and information, making them large Targets, that are eventually compromised, each address is secured individually.
It's not perfect security, individuals will be compromised, but the attack has to be broad to be profitable, because the reward is narrow.

Decentralization is a necessary condition for censorship.
I think you need to take a closer look at the word censorship. It implies that the dissemination of information is intercepted or curtailed by a third party. It is the act of preventing the decentralization of information. So without the decentralization of information, there is no need for censorship, hence censorship follows decentralization. 
I think the confusion here is that another form of decentralization is applied as the solution for routing around the censorship of the first form.

When real value is involved, it's like pumping a troll full of crack. Bitcoin brings real value to data. That means real value is at stake. The introduction of real value into the Internet sphere amplifies the already uninhibited personalities, both good and bad.
The typical troll gets a rush just from the idea that leaving ridiculous messages will piss in someone's punch. The idea that you can't unread something. Instant gratification. It's like setting a mine; knowing that someday it will kill someone, or take an extraordinary amount of effort to diffuse it. Their sadistic gratification is immediate, paid in advance. This rush is amplified by the fantasy that bitcoiners could loose real money. This is crack for trolls.

Right, except I have to wait 5 minutes for the person in front of me that hit New User. He's nearly done with the 2HR (or even 10 minute) video, but since I'm the typical consumer and don't want to wait for the newbie to finish. I go and find another BTM, one that doesn't attempt to train anyone. And because it doesn't do training videos, I can get consistently get my coin/cash quickly. It becomes my BTM of choice. So, the first BTM, that caters to the New User, will loose future business for that effort.
As a general rule with any operating machinery, if the equipment sits idle it's loosing money. In this case, if the BTM isn't transacting, it's operator is loosing profit. If the machine could charge for the training time, the machine would fulfill this goal and justify turning away "paying" customers. It would also establish that it needed a steady stream of newbies to stay in business. But realistically, if it were a 10 minute training video, and a normal transaction takes 2 minutes long, then you would have to charge a new user 5x transaction fees, which is completely unrealistic. "To learn about bitcoin, insert two dollars."
@_date: 2015-10-17 04:01:46
Sure, but that would be a scholastic ideal and not an economic or capitalist ideal. Someone or some company put that BTM in place to turn a buck. It isn't performing that function if it isn't transacting.

I lived through this period, as a tech type person, and I don't remember ever having to convince anyone to use email. Most I dealt with understood it immediately, and these are family, friends and customers, many of which were technophobic. I think there was a massive appeal to send a letter, with immediate delivery and no stamp. The part they didn't understand was dial-up, internet providers and operating Windows in general.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, deals with money, and that means risk. No one cares if you lose an email, but when you throw real value in the mix, you get a FUD barrier.
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:02:11
I understand his point, but you quickly get the walk-run problem. Next time I visit the BTM, I don't want to spend 2 hours. Not even 2 minutes. I certainly don't want to wait for the newbie in front of me to finish his 2 hour intro. Instructions are great for during the learning -to-walk phase, but it will quickly become a hindrance during the run phase.

    Everyone, check it out, I've got a troll on the hook!
    He's only one month old, so If I land him, I'm certainly
    going to have to throw him back. So join me on this little
    expedition...


    Wow! This new troll is fast little guy! Going straight
    for sarcasm with no time to even capitalize. So I'm going
    cast off with some logic to see if I get a bite. As you
    can see, my overall response already has enough
    sarcasm for a reddit post, so I'm good there.
Selling content and asking for tips don't have to be mutually exclusive, as owners an producers can do both.


    This could be fun, I sense this troll is mid to late 20's with
    some college free thinking. Observe the quick leap to using
    a that-being-said straw argument built on his prior flawed
    logic. I could use some more logic here, but I will loose him.
    I may use a colorful metaphor here to get him excited and
    stir some emotion.
Only a fucking idiot would compare arts and entertainment in the digital era with a one-off task like painting a fence! Downloads create a zero cost distribution model. You do realize that when you hit the play button on your MP3 player that it's a recording and not the actual artist playing the tune.


    He's a lively one! He finished with a question and a taunt!
    I could respond with a question in kind, but I'm going
    to avoid doing so. To me, the sport lies in the finesse, so
    I'm going save something for his next pass.
    I hope you all enjoyed this little troll adventure, I know I did.

I'd rather there be a method of embedding a verifiable bitcoin address, of the content owner(s) or beneficiaries, in the content that I download from any source, that I can feel confident in sending a tip. Players would support the extraction and verification of the address, so I only need to push a button, sending a microtip of preset size. That would apply to all content, including porn.

Get this. If you come in just under the threshold, it's double jeopardy. If they spot these cases that come in just under the threshold, the IRS confiscate the accounts, without notice, because they think you're deliberately trying to thwart detection. This has happened to a number of small mom-n-pop operations that have daily receipts just under the limit and get nailed. Some knew about and avoided the limit because of the added paperwork on routine deposits. The IRS apologized to these folks before Congress a couple of weeks back for these tactics. I'm sure it's all better now. &lt;/s&gt;
