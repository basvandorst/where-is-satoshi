Of course it is. This is basic basic stuff you can Google. Or just look in coinbase FAQs.

Reporting = telling the IRS on your tax forms. Not everything that's you report means you have to pay tax.
Here's how this works: exactly the same as stocks &amp; bonds in a standard brokerage account (which includes individual stocks &amp; bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds in brokerage accounts, and excludes any holdings in 401k, 403b, or traditional IRA acocunts).
If you buy and then sell for less than you bought over any time period: capital loss. You subtract your loss from your income and pay less taxes (i.e. you made 50,000 from work, bought 10k in BTC and sold for 8k. You have 2k in capital losses, which are subtracted from your income, so you're taxed on 48000 instead of 50000).
If you buy and sell for a profit in less than 365 days: short term capital gains. You add the gain (sell price minus buy price) to your income and are taxed at the normal rate. (i.e. Making 50k/yr again, you buy 10k and sell 15k, making 5k in gains. You're taxed on 55k all at the normal tax rate, maybe in the range of ~30%).
If you buy, hold for over 1 year, and sell for a profit: long term capital gains. You pay a discounted tax rate on your capital gains. With the same numbers as before, you'd be taxed on your 50k salary at the normal rate, and on the 5k in cap gains at a much lower rate. Depending on the specific numbers, you could pay ~30% on the 50k and ~10% on the long term capital gains.
ANY time you sell or even transfer from one currency to another is a Taxable Event. If you buy 1 btc @ 10k one day, a few days later you sell 0.5 btc @ 20k (for 10k), you made 5k capital gains on half a bitcoin and also still hold 0.5 btc. A few days later you buy back 0.5 btc at 10k (for 5k) to hold 1 full btc again, you still have the capital gains from the first sale and have to pay the taxes on it.
TLDR: same as capital gains taxes normally encountered on stocks and bonds in normal brokerage accounts.

You're looking at it from different angles. Your intended angle is to look at it horizontal, same orientation as the text. I can tell by the trusses under the track.
These other guys are looking at it vertically, in which case it does look like he's going forward downhill. That's how I thought it was oriented at first too. The only real way to tell is the trusses.

All the other replies are the. When you sell your bitcoin, that is a "taxable event." 
- If you sell for less than you bought, that is called a "capital loss." The loss can be subtracted from your income so you pay a little less tax. 
- If you sell for more than you bought, that is a "capital gain." if you held the BTC for less than 1 year, it's called a "short term capital gain" and is taxed at your normal tax rate (basically just add it to your income).
- If you held it for 1 year or more and sell for more than you bought it, it's called a "long term capital gain" and taxed at a much lower rate than your normal bracket.
If you make many transactions and/or the amounts bought/don't always align, thr easiest and most common way to determine your buy/sell dates and prices is calles FIFO, or First-line First-Out. This method makes the assumption that when you make a sale, you're selling the oldest bitcoins you have. The first bitcoin you bought is the first bitcoin you sell, FIFO. For example (using nice round numbers, and assuming all sales are profit and not loss) you buy 1 BTC on day 1, and buy 1 BTC after 1 year. You now have 2 BTC. You sell 0.5 BTC at 1.5 years, which using FIFO means you have 0.5 of your day-1 bitcoin left and all of your day 2 bitcoin. This sale is all Long-term capital gain because you bought it 1.5 years ago. The next day (still about 1.5 years in) you sell all your remaining 1.5 BTC. In this transaction, you sold 0.5 BTC for long-term cap gains, and 1 BTC for short-term cap gains (half a year since you bought the second BTC).

There's also nothing to say it WILL be either... Saying it will go up or down (or stay the same, for that matter) is all speculation.

Capital gains is not in the basic TurboTax package. It's an upgrade.
That said, if you made only made transactions between coins and USD (not coins for other coins, that complicates things real quick) and kept track of your transactions/prices/dates, I highly recommend doing your taxes yourself with the actual forms! It's not as complicated as TurboTax and H&amp;R and all the other tax software companies want you to think it is. I use this excel spreadsheet that some guy makes to help me with my taxes (basically to do the actual math for me):  and then fill out the actual form. Really helps you to understand what is actually happening with your taxes,and why you owe the number you owe (or get the number you get as refund).

It's the same as capital gain/loss tax. If you lose money, you subtract from your income. If you make money by selling under 1 year, it's taxed as short term cap gain. If you sell 1 year or longer, it's long term capital gain.

Thanks. I think I still need some clarification. So it would be what, a sale of 1BTC with an itemized deduction? Or a sale of 0.9 BTC with an itemized deduction? 
I'm guessing now that I consider it 0.9 BTC sale and the 0.1 BTC lost is no longer in the cost basis for anything. So it's like I bought 0.9 and am selling 0.9, and the USD value of the 0.1 (at the time the fee was incurred) can be deducted on sched A. 
I'm more interested in how losing money in fees affects the cost basis. I'm not going to have enough deductions to itemize, but if it can help anyone else then that's good to know too.

I get how capital gains tax works.  However, I am wondering how to reconcile coins lost in transfer fees.
Using arbitrary numbers, lets say I buy 1 BTC on Coinbase at $10,000.  I transfer it to my private wallet and back over the next few months, losing .1 BTC in fees (I know that's not a realistic fee but simpler numbers are simpler).  Now I sell my position at 6 months at $20,000, but I only have 0.9 BTC to sell for $18,000.  
How do I reconcile this on my taxes? Have I realized $8k on 1 BTC (.9\*20000 - 1\*10000)? Or $9000 on .9 BTC (.9\*20000 - .9\*10000) and the .1 I lost to fees is just like, I pretend it never existed? Or I can use it as cost basis for some other BTC I trade down in the future?
Edit: fixed asterisks meant for multiplication that were italicizing instead

Makes sense. Thanks for the help!

With so many -ham suffixed towns in MA, what right does Framingham have to claim the name "hamtown?"

Really? I can't comment on conflict areas, but tourist areas seem very well maintained. I went to Xplor and Xcaret over the winter (south of Cancun) and everything was well maintained, clean, etc. 
Xplor has a series of ziplines which were very safe, and all the operators took safety seriously. Xcaret has many performances and all were top notch. 
The grounds at the ruins of Tulum (further south from cancun) were also very well maintained. Additionally, we explored Puerto Morelos (a small beach village, not super touristy) and Playa del Carmen (moderately touristy city but mostly just along the actual coast) and never felt unsafe walking the streets as late as 1:00am. And to top it off I didn't have a single bad meal, even in the parks! Didn't even stick to typical Mexican cuisine, all the food was just tops.

Better than average, that's solid
