What's greedy about becoming wealthy? There's nothing wrong with investing money in the right area and getting rewarded for it. He was just wise with how he used his money. Doesn't make him automatically greedy

Yeah I'm still trying to learn about mining but like I said, I think that's the gist of how miners make money but I know that they make small percentages off fees but glad that helped some

What does it mean when the status is yellow and says "wip" I use mycelium for example.

A node is an endpoint, typically a server though

Bitcoin is not much different from any other currency in the respects that it only has value because we say it has value. We decide value partly based on rarity. For example gold is much rarer than copper so it has a higher value. With Bitcoin it's essentially 1's and 0's much similar to regular credit cards. But in the end, it only has the value people place on it along with it being more rare/harder to obtain which gives it a natural value. I hope this helped some

Well people are willing to pay for it because it has been decided for it to be used as a currency. Take this for example. A gold necklace has value, but it's not used as currency. Once it is decided by people to use as currency, then people will trade these 1's and 0's for goods/services. But with mining, that's a little different. mining machines earn small amounts of money because when someone makes a purchase using Bitcoin, there will be a fee to pay. Much like buying concert tickets online and there's a 5$ processing fee that goes with it. Miners will get a small percentage of that extra fee. Thats essentially how miners make money. Now how do miners get connected to that fee you ask? Well I'm a little Shakey on that part itself but to my understanding, miners are like nodes (servers) on a network. They pass information (or Bitcoin) from buyer to seller and they pass on your transaction by constantly dehashing algorithims that unlocks a figurative gate that allows funds to pass through. Now when you choose the fee you want to pay, you are essentially choosing how many nodes or miners you want your Bitcoin to pass through (again this is to my understanding) in order to make the transaction faster. Each time it passes through a node, I think the fee raises but so does it's speed.  I hope this helps give you a better idea. Try looking up how Bitcoin minining works and it'll help you understand the value better. But also look into how credit cards equal money/value. I think of you understand how that works, it'd help understand the value behind Bitcoin since credit cards are more basic of a concept because digital value is much different than physical.

Got it, thanks.
