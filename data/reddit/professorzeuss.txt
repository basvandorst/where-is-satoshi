He has a brain. That is all.

Do you understand that the whole idea of a proper BTC wallet is that there is no bank? No middleman, no fuckboys playing you. Did you listen to the full 2 hours? What he said was to use exchanges for buying Bitcoin only, then transfer to a good hot/cold wallet.

Not if YOU want to be the true owner of your coins. Moreover, the number of exchanges that have either been hacked or ran away with customer's coins is baffling. Exchanges are not banks, they are exchanges. You simply trade currency on them.

BU is the poison that would kill Bitcoin. Segwit nigga please.

pokertravis, just go away... keep your (i mean the exchange's) coins on your exhange. But don't insult a bright young man just because you take phrases out of context and don't listen to the full story. Embarrassing.

850 looks like a real possibility. I'm 50% out for now. Lower price are not a bad thing right now

100% agree. Problem is miners are not approaching segwit with any level of pragmatism.

50% of LT BTC holdings sold?
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:48:53
That is probably one of the best advices ever.

Nobody wants BU. Isn't it dead already?

Let's say hypothetically your exchange gets hacked and someone steals your coins. What would you say then? Banks are insured against such events. A lot of BTC exchanges are not. Stop comparing apples and pears. You only maje yourself look like a fool.

I'm not pro-core, but I'm VERY anti-BU. BU is horsefecal matter peddled by mining gear merchants.

If you setup a transfer early morning, deposits are usually confirmed by 11:30AM the following day. Remember to follow Bitstamp's instructions thoroughly.

If using SEPA, you get significantly more coin on Bitstamp than Coinbase due to much lower transaction fees (starting at 0.25% vs 1.99%).
Using debit/credit card, Coinbase charges a 3.99% fee. If you live in a non USD/EUR country you also have to account for the conversion fee. Usually, a further 1.75% hidden on top of a slightly high exchange rate.
