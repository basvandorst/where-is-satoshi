If you were to spend 10k a year ago ONLY on BTC I want you to think about the value... versus spending 10k divested across BTC, LTC, and ETH, your USD values would be much different. LTC went up like 6000% vs BTC only 1500%. Even on shit downtrend days, you would will have a better portfolio by diversifying. In most investment cases, diversity is key. (Disclaimer: Engineer, not investor, but I know basic math)

Do yourself a favor, don't listen to any advice on Reddit, a vast majority of opinions are from people who are not REAL investors (such as myself) and are only along for the ride. This market could tank or sky rocket... Go read about some of the crypto out there, and if you like the underlying tech ideas behind each coin, diversify your money.

Use coinbase pro and the fees are minimal. Regular coinbase is a scam when it comes to fees

Why would someone who is clearly so disinterested in Bitcoin continually go on interviews bashing crypto? I have this gut feeling his firm is buying up crypto assets and trying not to bring attention to this.

This was the same sentence people were saying in January 2018... Almost verbatim
