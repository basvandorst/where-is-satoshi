“Here in my rented house for the day....with my rented lambo for the hour”.

If this were the early-mid 1990s, Tai’s content would be pumped on late night infomercials with a 1-800 # to buy his book/vhs.....there is nothing significantly different with his “self-help” content and all other “self-help” gurus over the years, except that he was first to market with YouTube using the line “hey, I’m in my (rented) garage with my lambo”....that visual is much more of a selling point that seeing him next to a car/mansion in a book (most under 25 yr olds don’t read anymore, they just watch the internet - I know because I teach at a University).....he does what all the late 90s rappers did - promote a look of wealth, to make wealth from low quality content sales.....he is a marketer that sells content - the fact he makes $ does not mean his stuff is high quality, free or not—— he will not be remembered in 20yrs as a “great”. In fact, I would bet that he will have some lawsuits in the coming years.

Great tough internet talk, by likely a child who lives at home with his/her parents.  Go back to your room at mommy’s and daddy’s house —- and stop trying to live for freebies —- Learn how to work for your keep, fool.

Simple Bank is the best (but also under BBVA Compass, who is actively working with Blockchain vendors)

I guess that went over your head —— he still was posing either way....I buy my properties, and never show them off.

I’m an independent consultant - University stuff is for fun on the side. I’m not going to elaborate anymore - my suggestion for you is to live some more (another 20 yrs, on your own) experience life, raise kids, travel the world - especially a rural 3rd world country - and then you’ll better understand when someone is feeding you BS on an internet channel, vs. personally knowing real multi-millionaires that earned it on their own, without reading “guides to get rich”. 
“ Life Wealth” is created by having a strong circle of positive people around you that can guide/coach you directly - if you can go call Tai for advice, then you’ll be all set!!!! Otherwise, your just following someone else’s BS.

Thanks for taking the time to understand.

Everything you said is Apple Pie - I’m talking about rentals - been doing this 12 years. My point is, he is using false imagery to sell “snake oil”— there are people out there who are vulnerable to materialism advertising, so his ethics are questionable —— just because he rents it, does not mean his net worth is really that significant.
