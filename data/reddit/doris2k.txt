Unregulated bitcoin can go to any price the market will bear. If it goes high enough, early adopters will get rich. It doesn't matter that they didn't earn it, or whether or not some Reddit posters think they deserve it.

He's bluffing.
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:58:03
I trust there are many geniuses currently working to prevent this.
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:06:04
Yes. But an exchange to/from fiat?
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:32:49
So... wait to buy BTC until after black Friday?
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:57:41
Ironic that if bitcoin is a success, there will be no need for a Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:44:41
And go themselves, or send their own family members to do it. Damn straight.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:22:02
That's very powerful, thank you. I had never seen that clip before (or the documentary containing it).
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:14:29
How did that work out for those empires?
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:25:17
With every new adopter, the world changes.
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:56:36
Because he doesn't have a case. See Bill O'Reilly for another example of the "baffle 'em with bullshit" stance.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:27:29
Self defense is not the same as nation-building wars of conquest. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:48:47
How do you know that they don't?
@_date: 2015-11-27 18:17:01
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:16:17
Raising the limit from 21 million to 21 kajillion. :)
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:07:20
Good point!
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:34:34
True that.
@_date: 2015-11-21 00:31:45
They could just say "deposit all cash into an approved account within 90 days and use your debit card for all transactions. After 90 days, all paper cash will not be honored." That sort of thing.....
@_date: 2015-11-27 04:04:14
@_date: 2015-11-26 05:13:54
As soon as pigs fly.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:43:39
If you buy bitcoin and it goes to zero, you'll lose all your laptop money. If you buy a laptop now instead, even if BTC rockets to $10k, you'll still have your laptop.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:16:18
$500 by Christmas?
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:35:49
4 kajillion.
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:38:20
No, just substantially diminish.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:55:15
How do you get reimbursed for the time and expense to do that?
@_date: 2015-11-21 00:32:28
Banning bitcoin seems harder than banning cash. Certainly harder to enforce....
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:32:20
Always has been.
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:11:36
407 on Preev now.
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:16:05
Really? How did it work out for those empires?
@_date: 2015-11-06 18:46:10
"crickets chirping"
@_date: 2015-11-06 02:15:23
Wow my very first tip. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:05:11
...or more likely a genius.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:11:48
He sounds like a Mob boss. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:09:15
Bitcoin will remove a lot of those hoops.
@_date: 2015-11-23 02:10:36
Bitcoin Users Accounts Unaffected.
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:52:34
And you're, which should have been *your*
@_date: 2015-11-06 02:24:02
At what price would you buy more? Because that's probably the next bottom. :)
@_date: 2015-11-26 05:15:59
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:39:45
This is what most people who scream "but what about the roads!" don't seem to understand.
@_date: 2015-11-30 04:14:23
Only time will tell.
@_date: 2015-11-23 02:17:56

301 on Preev...
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:24:50
Seems a very bitter and unimaginative way of getting back at her family. She could have given it all to a local charity.
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:55:55
What a bunch of malarkey.
@_date: 2015-11-30 04:19:37
That would be bitchen!
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:09:32
Another potential solution to a bank run: stop using banks.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:07:33
@_date: 2015-11-01 03:23:30
Decentralized and anonymous. Is it possible?
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:29:01
At least the price went down. They'll get less money for the stolen loot!
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:39:57
Not endless wars like these.
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:56:42
Is the DOJ that Jamie is referring to the same DOJ that is currently selling 44,000 bitcoin for US dollars today? LOL
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:51:37
But won't it be $10,000 by then?
@_date: 2015-11-20 23:58:50
The idea that there is ever "due process" except where it benefits the State is what I was referring to as a bunch of malarkey.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:32:28
$415 on Preev.
@_date: 2015-11-06 01:26:10
Slightly better than what?
@_date: 2015-11-20 03:08:39
And... the price drops.
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:50:51


Votes have been bought and sold for years....
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:33:27
New governments?
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:44:09
This is a brilliant translation.
@_date: 2015-11-23 02:11:41
There are no stupid questions. Only stupid answers.
@_date: 2015-10-30 04:08:49
$330.10 on Preev now...
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:09:42
Depending on the DOJ to maybe make your competition illegal? Great business plan.
@_date: 2015-11-29 00:50:13
And spell there, t-h-e-i-r.
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:58:17
Is the DOJ that Jamie is referring to the same DOJ that is currently selling 44,000 bitcoin for US dollars today? LOL
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:34:39
And just because someone is retarded, doesn't mean they can't be a leader, or even a president!
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:39:25
Both, just like the dollar.
@_date: 2015-11-22 02:44:45
Can you prove that?
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:59:36


Sure, and the corporate-controlled media is totally free not to air it. Nice spin. :)
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:39:29
Based on today's activity, apparently not.
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:03:53
Get rich slow!
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:53:46
Always check the expiration date before buying.
@_date: 2015-11-06 18:03:20
Based on what?
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:39:08
The intent is very important to the discussion. The concept of somebody defending themselves after being personally threatened is far different than a government killing half a million children in a country that's mainly guilty of not being American enough.
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:48:02
Why don't they just send them all to a burn address then? Serious question. I agree with you that "money" is printed at will.
@_date: 2015-11-02 18:29:43
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:45:29
Horse and buggy manufacturer wages war against the automobile. So what?
@_date: 2015-11-06 18:39:29
Eh, he's one of a group of mere aging mortals defending an obsolete and antiquated system with the threat of possible violence. How long can that last? 
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:46:36
Governments don't need no stinkin' laws....
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:30:34
Due process and such.... What a bunch of malarkey.
@_date: 2015-11-19 04:03:02
Good! Pretty hard to make bitcoin illegal if it can't be traced. In fact, I predict a surge in popularity.
@_date: 2015-11-22 02:46:53
You're right. And I'm not. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:05:59
And perhaps your arrogance outshines your intellect. I'll leave it you to try and figure out.
@_date: 2015-10-10 21:25:09
To me, they come off sounding sad and desperate. "It's just too scary outside the comfort zone!" What's wrong with providing an option? Nobody's forcing anyone to use it.
@_date: 2015-11-30 04:16:55
If anything, it sure keeps bitcoin interesting.
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:44:53
Good! Pretty hard to make bitcoin illegal if it can't be traced to a specific transaction partner.
@_date: 2015-10-24 18:10:35
Always assume that some of it goes to Dick Cheney.
@_date: 2015-11-06 02:40:10
Gutsy! In my opinion, it will pay off very well for you.
@_date: 2015-10-28 04:22:04
307.3 on Preev

The income tax will probably change to a consumption tax.
@_date: 2015-10-24 18:34:54
Buy $2.50 worth and wait a year.
@_date: 2015-10-28 01:23:13
It is what it is. And likely unstoppable.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:42:26
Anything under $700 seems reasonable.
@_date: 2015-10-29 16:26:06
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down....
@_date: 2015-10-25 19:45:27
And interest is growing daily. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 00:29:37
Yes, but of the two extremes, I hear it's the better one.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:17:33
Tesla. Fossil fuels are so last century.
@_date: 2015-11-19 22:05:31
Or time to buy.
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:16:44
You mean "terrorists." Nudge nudge, wink wink.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:21:23
If the war looks like a good investment
That's a big if, and war is a disgusting investment.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:05:23
I wouldn't have sold at $250. Does that help?
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:11:10
$445 is now seen as a collapse. These are good days.
