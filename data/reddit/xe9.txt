So this entire post was so you could brag you had "a three digit amount" of bitcoin? 
what are you 12?
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:05:35
im not saying there's anything wrong with that but it would be nice to be able to finally move beyond the hype about how high the price is today....you know 'evolve' to the next level. it just be nice to see bitcoin move to that next level. i just think so long as price was probably hyper inflated...it was more a hinderance to that happening. should price fall that hype might die down and we could possibly see greater actual use of bitcoin as a currency. but who knows maybe im just retarded windbag who drinks too much wine?

Why?  A little paranoia is a good thing i think.  Maybe a highly developed evelutionary survival mechanism.  If you can question and anticipate possible scenarios it seems you are smartly looking out for your welfare.  Lack of paranoia concerns me so much more.  It seems the byproduct of a weak mind that has given in or given up.  Paranoia generates questions and those are always a good thing.

Another reason to have dual boot pc with linux. If you download armory on a linux os you can very easily checksum the download for authenticity. Plus it runs better on linux install....at least mine does.

Learn how to put your coins in cold storage. You dont have to leave your bitcoin on anyone's exchange. Just leave a spendable amount on the exchange you would use for everyday purchases or what your selling and put the rest in storage.

you have been lucky. my transactions in the past have taken on average 30-45 minutes. iv'e even had some coinbase transactions take several hours. if you havn't seen anything show up after six or so hours then i would start to consider contacting them.

Hopefully someone does and caves in his kneecaps. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:22:55
I dont get it...there is more demand than they can keep up with but the price has been plummeting on their exchange all day? Then there must be some insane selling going on to overtake demand. Dont they have sellers bitcoin to turn around and sell back to all the demanding buyers? Something isn't adding up. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:26:19
be patient...it can take an hour or more to show up sometimes.

Breaking $500 was a significant sign of weakness for bitcoin. That price was in my opinion, a retreat from strong buying on weak fundamentals that I think was all china. If we remember bitcoin was only  around $125 before china got on board. Technically there was really no fundamental reason why bitcoin would or will not drop to the next lowest technical area of support (the highs of the cyprus event) after dropping below $500. My opinion is that unless some significant fundamentals kick in very soon we will see a test of $260ish. I would be very cautious personally even at that price and would wait for a bottom and a re-test of that bottom if it holds, before buying back in. I dont think going back to $125ish-$200 is unfeasable.

Mark karpeles has to stop selling all the 800K stolen bitcoin then price can start going back up.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:53:26
bitcoin needs to collapse. i honestly think it will do it more good in the long run if it does. i'm a firm believer in bitcoins future but i'd honestly love to see it crash so people will stop focusing on it as much as a get rich quick scheme and more for what it was designed for or at least what i think it was designed for. maybe then people will start to actually use it *en masse*. and i could also buy a ton of cheap bitcoin if it crashes and get rich quick and retire early.

well if its supposed to replace cash it needs to get pretty instant I think?
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:53:01
I hope so because the first words in the first  sentence of satoshi's white paper is "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash". electronic cash implies instant transactions. Have the core devs lost site of this implied vision? I'm not bashing them serious question? is there something they could or should have done to prevent this backward slide sooner?
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:39:27
ok fair enough.  the fee was the auto suggested fee. the fee was also auto suggested fee in 2012 era. if I wanted to go buy a coffee with bitcoin how could I be expected to wait 10 minutes standing at a counter waiting for a confirmation. why are we at a 10 minute average confirmation time for a simple transaction? if bitcoin is supposed to be a currency that's easily and quickly useable how are we expected to use it with such long confirmation times for such simple tasks? even ten minutes is incredibly long for a currency...why is it 10 minutes? what is the cause of such a long delay? I can pay with credit card or cash instantly. how can bitcoin be expected to replace a currency at this rate?
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:12:09
well yesterday just for fun I sent $5 worth of bitcoin to one of my wallets as an experiment. three hours later still no confirmation. how can we be expected to use it as a currency in its current state except to trade to make money or hold as a store of value? sorry not bashing you OP rhetorical question. we have been pigeon holed into a useable path for bitcoin and I blame the devs.

I don't know anything about encryption blocks but personally I would stay far, far away from bitcoin stocks if that's what you meant. there is basically no regulation and the company can pull the plug, scam or make up its own rules at will. believe me I lost a lot of bitcoin in the early days of bitcoin stocks. I was foolish and greedy...out of over half a dozen investments only casino bitcoin survives but at a very discounted rate on return. wait until/if they are regulated and accountable...in the meantime trading bitcoin and altcoins is way safer and a hell of a lot more profitable.

your idea makes more sense than mine because with your idea the rich can avoid socially higher taxes on luxury items as i suggested might happen and the banks and govornment stay in control.
@_date: 2017-07-23 01:47:32
i dont think federal and local governments will ever let it get to that point. dont underestimate them they are not that stupid. if for example a shift from fiat to an cryptocurrency started to happen they would simply shift where taxes came from. i would think they would simply raise taxes in a major way on consumables, property, vehicles etc...etc...etc...to make up any offset lost to federal or state taxes. that may actually be a good thing if your a socialist as the heaviest burden of taxation may get shifted to the most expensive and luxurious items....obama and bernie would be proud. they should be pumping bitcoin for us. the people may end up owning their currency but the govornments will always own the lands we live in and everything that goes on there. at least for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:02:16
selling bitcoin and cashing it in for fiat are two separate things. trying to get cash out of an exchange does not affect the price of bitcoin to the best of my knowledge. all he would need is a single corrupt bank or banker I would think, or several. Jesus man were talking Russia, no offense I love the country but I get the feeling corrupt banks are like 7/11's in the US. I still think a reasonably intelligent criminal in his circumstance would not be so bold or or reckless to draw unwanted attention by dumping huge amounts of BTC on the open market quickly or in huge batches. the fact that BTC-e's price has consistently been below everyone else's for years maybe suggests this was a long going, carefully orchestrated selloff/launder of bitcoin. ive traded BTC-e since its inception and its always to my memory anyways been the lowest price per BTC exchange.

yeah the Markets tab has all the links still.

huh? can you fill in the blanks?
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:46:41
I don't think it had much to do with the price of bitcoin in general.  if I had hundreds of million of dollars of bitcoin to unload and an anonymous exchange to use to do it with I would slowly sell it off carefull not to cause too many ripples or be too obvious. if he had accounts across many exchanges and was doing it all at once I could understand but that probably would have been too transparent. chances are he was only using btc-e or maybe one or two more anonymous exchanges and selling some off on the genuine bitcoin highs but not enough to dramatically change the price direction of the currency. my guess anyways. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:30:25
only lost about $100 but was just about to transfer coins over to btc-e in coming days. was waiting to de-link my two factor authentication that I couldn't remember. whew.....

yeah its been a popular trading site because it was one of the first and easily accessible altcoin exchanges as far back as 2012-2013ish. kinda like going to a casino...tons of legit, good old everyday folks gambling in the casino but god only knows what going on behind closed doors. sad to see everyday traders loose out because of this. chances are good anyone who lost coins there will never see them again.

@_date: 2017-07-27 04:09:08
some resistance at $2600-2625. if it breaks through that looks like clear skies to 2700ish range. I think were going to pop up to 2625ish and drop back to test support at $2480 range before we can go higher than $2700. would be really nice to see it break $2700 though. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:05:57
dont feel bad. i had a lot of them in 2012 and cashed out cheap. now five years later i'm spending $2000 for an amount of bitcoin i used to throw away regularly playing with wallets and just goofing around with friends... enjoy what ya got.

lol yeah that's what I am thinking. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:54:26
i wish i could answer that. that's the million dollar question. no one really truly knows the fair value of any coin at any moment. its 100% speculative all the time. i know lame answer but that's the truth. if you want to invest in bitcoin or altcoins you should understand them and the technology behind them. if you believe in it and its future you should consider investing a % of your wealth in whichever you choose, current price be damned. if you choose to daytrade the coins though then you really need to understand trading and price action, technical analysis and fundamental factors regarding bitcoin and what can drive its price. that's an entirely different subject. as for which to choose...as a trader its subjective but for now i'm sticking with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:21:39
huh? exploded? its still struggling to break out of resistance technically speaking although it looks like it might...we shall see which emotion rules the day tomorrow though fundamentally. i'm hoping greed :D

you can still load BTCUSD charts though if they are bookmarked or already loaded in a browser. my BTCUSD chart is operating normally and updating as it should. I can even switch between exchanges normally including coinbase. maybe tech error? BTC-e chart looks freaky.

@_date: 2017-07-22 18:14:03
Coinbase is a good broker to use to buy bitcoin. There are others i guess it depends on where you live. if your in the US they are one of the best options. You can follow its worth from coinbase's  site. Bitcoin Wisdom is a great free charting website. tons of usefull info there and decent price charts. if you want to try daytrading BTC-e is a good site that's been around a while now. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:43:47
Well considering the price was $150ish before they piled into bitcoin it seems reasonable. The sooner the better. Be nice to get over this whole china drama....its starting to become a real bore. So much other good news getting drowned out by the overly dramatic China stories.
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:36:32
I personaly think people have become complacent and need to become smarter regarding technology and start taking some responsibility for their laziness. Thats the only reason why this scam is so effective. We simply need to adapt and become smarter then these sorts of problems will become minor issues. Constantly trying to shirk responsibility by pointing fingers at everyone else for our problems is not being honest and Iignores the real issue. Thats what modern governments have become professionals at doing and is why we have so many problems. 
 A $75 backup harddrive and five minutes every couple of weeks woyld prevent this entire problem. Basic things that have been preached about since computers were introduced mainstream decades ago.  Bitcoin has nothing at all to do with this discussion as does any other form of payment...
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:54:25
Well considering the points you make above...lets say my argument becomes invalid because the problem moves beyond the individuals ability to reasonably protect themselves...I think we make an evolutionary shift, or we would have to by necessity. Again I do think bitcoin or any other form of payment becomes irrelevant.  What would have to happen is that technology would have to change and adapt. I cant be specific since its not my profession but maybe we would have to shift to an entirely new technology for computing. new forms of cryptography at the personal/pc level.Its sort of ironic bitcoin seems to have been born out of the necessity for change that it now could be responsible for creating. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:33:46
So why cant reservations start bitcoin friendly banks?
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:03:14
Thanks...i figured thats how its done but it would be so nice if it was a seamless (single payment source/ single card) process. 
it probably sounds petty but having to stand in very busy, rush hour, los angeles whole foods checkout line and go through multiple cards, check balances, use a card, then another, possibly a third to buy a bag full of groceries is a real pain. 
i know all these bitcoin payment options are in their infancy and i will probably deal with the hasstle to support bitcoin but it would be a nice feature i think to be able to add funds to an existing card. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:07:19
