You understand that some people keep their money in crypto, right?

Exactly, bitcoin now "crashes" at 12k.  That is not exactly a bubble.

Time to buy.
Do people really think that it will just continue to gradually increase in value with no dips?

When it hits 20k "I am a genius investor!"
When it drops to 12k "Fuck this gambling ponzi scheme!"

That has lasted a decade and is still gping strong.

The "moral of the story" is learn to tell when something is about to trend downwards (those aren't "crashes") and then sell, and then buy again when it begins to trend upwards.  That's what stock traders do.

I made more money from bitcoin today than I did at work.

This sub is a ponzi scheme?  I don't think that term means what you think it does.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:34:17
Not yet.

It feels good to waste money on hookers and drugs too, but ultimately giving is a moral decision that is chosen without any real benefit to the giver.  i.e. altruism.
