what connects/relates these payments to Neo Bee? &lt;- That's the part you are missing.
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:36:07
how do you know it is dividends?
how do you know the payment is from N&amp;B?
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:21:17
yeah, "Patrick" gets mad when you question his journalistic integrity.  I asked them why we should pay journalists to write news stories as well, then he starts in with insults.
This is a common blackhat shakedown method.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:22:13
It's not my opinion.  That article was not based on anything factual.  If she had actual evidence or "facts" as NW claims, then they would have presented them.  There is no real evidence in that article. Her entire story revolves around the statement she claims he made, and she provides absolutely no context for that statement in the story.
That's exactly what tabloids do, they fabricate a story based on circumstantial evidence and/or evidence out of context.  And that's exactly what was done here.
@_date: 2014-06-28 23:24:06
is it ok to mention the name Mark Karpeles?  Because Reddit didn't seem to have a problem with the community posting evidence of him committing fraud/scams against reddit members.
why the double standard?

You seem to want to reduce govt in Texas, but how does that work when it comes to environment, when the govt's roles in Texas is already very small, and coincidentally, your state has a terrible record on environmental issues?
What is your position on the environmental issues that currently plague Texas?
What is your position on water use and drought prevention/preparation?
What is your position on climate change and proposed solutions? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:36:19
yeah, it's a failed tabloid.

@_date: 2014-03-07 17:44:21
so posting a complete BS story without any actual evidence is typical of what?
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:40:04


I agree with this


it depends on what part of Texas you are talking about. Rural areas seem to have absolute property rights.  In fact, if you are homesteaded, the govt can't even take your primary home if you don't pay taxes.  And don't forget, you can shoot someone if they trespass. :)
So, in some areas, Texans have strong property rights.  I admit that in surburban or urban areas, it's a lot different.
@_date: 2014-04-03 22:28:05
it's a page that lists share ownership.  There's nothing that ties these payments to N&amp;B
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:52:01
and I'm saying this is not the first of their articles that they put together without one shred of actual evidence.  While they may have been on par with respected publishers in the past, this has not been the case recently.  
Let me be clear: if an organization regularly publishers articles without basis in fact, then they can be accurately described as a tabloid.
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:49:26
yeah, I think they are just scraping for them.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:02:44
they can have good content (hell, even I was mentioned in Newsweek a few years ago), but the sensationalist cover stories are what get me.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:19:03
Karpeles has said several things that contradict that document like:
"Well, technically speaking it’s not “lost” just yet, just temporarily unavailable"

With Abbott's Tort reform, I don't know how that solution will hold up in the long term.
Though, with respect to corporations' abilities to gauge risk vs reward, I still don't see lawsuits as a realistic deterrent to environmental destruction.  After all, a great amount of Texas land that has been abused has been abused by the legal title holder.  It's not against the law to exploit resources to their full capacity, nor destroy your own land or water.
What I'm saying is that you can't rely on the courts to do everything, you need legislation to do their part, as well.

from other threads on this subreddit, those numbers are seriously questionable.
@_date: 2014-04-03 22:29:52
yeah, you are missing a lot:
* 1. Any sort of evidence to links the sending address to N&amp;B
* 2. Any sort of evidence to suggest these are N&amp;B dividends
You've found an address that happens to be listed as a shareholder, and it received a few small payments.  You've jumped to the conclusion that these payments must be dividends from N&amp;B
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:27:39
yes, I agree, but when there is little information/evidence to go by, we have to work with what we got.  A lot of people have acted like that leaked document was legitimate (even Mark somewhat confirmed it, kinda), but these coins bring up significant doubt to the validity of that explanation.

exactly!  you win the reading comprehension award for today!
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:36:51
Well, I see Texas making more exceptions for corporations to do these things, and property rights don't necessarily come into it.
Take, for instance, the West, Texas "accident".  Many, many EPA and safety violations prior to the explosion.  Where were the govt regulators and enforcers?  Well, in Texas, especially under Perry, those roles have been gutted.  So, safety and environmental violations go unnoticed, and then you have a major explosion that COULD HAVE been a serious incident killing a lot of people. Allowing people to "sue" after the fact doesn't deal with the core issue.
Reducing the govt's role in environmental protection has not led to better environmental conditions in Texas.  In fact, Texas has some major environmental issues, even beyond fracking, like air and water quality (can't be addressed through property rights).
Do you see the conflict here between environmental protection and reduced govt regulation on businesses?
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:12:00


what evidence leads you to the conclusion that it's "over"?
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:26:23
nah, we bought at $400
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:20:28
Funny, cause if you weren't the guy every said you were, you'd deny it, too.
Newsweek can't prove he's Satoshi.  They had no real evidence.  He doesn't have to prove shit, we assume he's not Satoshi until evidence is presented that confirms otherwise.
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:18:19
I was also contacted by "Patrick"  When I replied that I was interested in him doing a story, he said I would have to pay first.  When I asked why should we pay "journalists" to write news stories, he started making insults about me and my site.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:59:53
yeah, but how do you know similar things are not happening with other exchanges/services.  This went on for quite a while and no one really noticed or cared.  I don't know why we would assume it's not still going on right now.
edit: I guess what I'm getting at is that declaring something "over" on the day you find out about it may be premature. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:21:49
spot-on?  nothing's been confirmed.  Blockchain evidence is starting to contradict your sources.
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:45:22
No, I want them to discuss with the experts before causing public panic.  They don't have to keep it quite, but they should discuss major issues with the core developers before freaking out and blaming the protocol for their poor implementations.
The choice isn't hide the issue or panic.

@_date: 2014-05-12 21:17:28


so, where do you stand on the hypothesis of man-made climate change?
if you support the evidence suggesting that climate change is caused by human actions and pollution, what role should the govt play in the proposed solutions?
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:06:03
oh right, yes, the lost private key is certainly the most plausible.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:13:20
that's true, but it also makes the story of "750K btc stolen" seem more unlikely.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:37:19
I agree.  I don't see a confirmation of the numbers anywhere, and I see a lot of people (Mark) avoiding confirmation, which to me indicates that they are incorrect.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:15:23
Ok, you agree with the hypothesis that humans are causing climate change.  But, where do you stand with the proposed solutions?
I guess what I'm getting at is that do you see that an issue like climate change is beyond the capabilities of a reduced govt role and that the reliance on "private property rights" to address such an issue are limited?
Your state is actually a perfect example of this in action, as the decrease in environmental regulation and enforcement has a direct correlation with increase in pollution and abuse.  
Respect of property rights hasn't led to a cleaner Texas.
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:25:07
no, that's wrong.  There is a clear distinction.  And anthropogenic climate change is considered a hypothesis, not a theory in the scientific community.
Saying that it is fact because many scientist believe the hypothesis to be true is a logical fallacy (appeal to authority). The mark of a scientific theory is not that it is favored by "the consensus" but rather that it is: a) falsifiable and b) not falsified in repeated trials.
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:41:23
not even close to the biggest known problem.  that's why it is a low priority fix.  
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:52:49
this is a good idea.  The Labcoin guys were previous scammers, so was Danny Brewster, and TradeFortress (inputs.io/Coinlenders)
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:33:40
yeah, so that fiat was stolen at least 6 months ago, and why are we just noticing now?
Still, it means that almost 1000 btc was stolen each and every day for 2 years.  That seems pretty far-fetched.
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:19:10
I wonder where they got all of our contact information.  Bitcointalk hack perhaps?
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:05:34
no, I just think it's funny that they are the one exchange everyone always expects to fold, but they don't.  
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:27:26
Mods delete scam reports, now?  Interesting.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:17:21
I feel that is also casts some doubt on the "official" story of 750K coins being stolen and only 2K remaining.
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:28:54
why are all reports of this being deleted by mods?
@_date: 2014-06-28 14:54:23
I imagine what happened was that Bitcoin Journal flagged all the negative comments that provided evidence of their fraud/scam and mods deleted accounts without actually looking at the content of the thread.
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:21:33
he raised the majority of those IPO funds back when BTC was around $100.
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:27:02
or, alternatively, the mods just deleted everything that got complaints.  Where did complaints come from?
@_date: 2015-05-11 14:25:30
Roe v Wade, abortion is protected under constitutional right to privacy.
There is a good case for gay marriage under “equal protection clause” or the “due process clause” of the 14th amendment. The 14th amendment prohibits states from depriving “any person” of “life, liberty or property” without “due process of law”.  Marriage has been upheld many times by SCOTUS as “a central part of the liberty protected by the due process clause".
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:02:11
yes, I agree
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:51:25


We are not talking about the same bill.
His "filibuster" today talking about patriot act/NSA was during the time when the Senate was supposed to be debating the TPP, which he voted for.  It does not delay or stop the vote on extension of Patriot Act at all.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:06:51
except that you couldn't withdraw fiat for like 6 months.

@_date: 2014-02-27 21:26:00
well, it's the story the press and most of the bitcoin community was running with, so that's why I labeled it "official".  I agree that there's nothing actually official about it.

3rd line of that link:


@_date: 2015-05-21 00:18:07
he has only ever supported medical MJ, never legalization
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:26:01
yeah, that was the clincher for me, too.
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:26:21


Not according to the SCOTUS.  Abortion is a privacy issue, and women have a constitutional right to privacy.  Rand seeks to violate this right by banning abortion.
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:06:34
then why hasn't he ever supported legalization on a federal level?
@_date: 2015-05-11 23:46:00


Not when you are talking about giving States the power to do precisely that.
"I don't like Feds taking my liberty, so I'll make sure States do instead."

please explain how they lost the btc, but it's still there.
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:19:45
it's a dog and pony show to try and look good for the Presidential elections.  His dad used to to similar things, add a bunch of pork to bills, then vote against them (if they were going to pass anyway), so he could say he voted against it, even though he benefited from those bills.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:44:37
GovCoin, anyone?
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:16:49


keeping it illegal.
@_date: 2015-05-11 19:13:16
Except that having a SCOTUS ruling doesn't prevent states from still making laws that limit people's rights, it just gives those people a route to fight those laws through the Federal courts.
The States don't have a strong history of protecting individual liberty or constitutional rights, and that's firmly within the power and responsibility of the Fed govt.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:32:18
Where is he "pushing" to do anything?  He didn't co-sponsor that bill. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:38:17
but then he rails against pork spending on bills.  It's called being a hypocrite.  He doesn't want anyone else to get govt money, just his district.  
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:48:56
He claims to be libertarian, but there are a lot of issues and his voting record that dispute that.
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:04:18
Medical MJ only.  That's not legalization.
He voted for TPP.
He proposed almost $200 B increase in military spending.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:22:29
You realize they'll likely outlive everyone, right?
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:20:07


It is his job to interfere when states violate individual's constitutional rights.
Not interfering means those things would remain illegal.
@_date: 2014-06-28 23:22:24
I agree.  Posting evidence of an outright scam should not be censored.
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:18:01
no it didn't, it would have limited their ability to record data on American citizens, and he voted against it.  It didn't pass.
@_date: 2014-04-03 22:31:07
you have to know where the money starts to follow it.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:49:46
I never questioned whether climate change was a fact.  I asked him where he stood on the hypothesis that humans cause climate change.
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:27:18
he voted against reigning in the NSA just a few months ago...  and voted for the TPP
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:06:10
In his own words, he claims to be a "constitutional conservative", which is not a Libertarian.  
@_date: 2015-05-22 01:19:27
no, it isn't, read the bill, it only relates to state laws regarding medical MJ
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:25:20
There have been many proposals for full legalization, and he has never supported them. You are either for legalization or you're not.  He's not.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:25:07
"medical marijuana"
Not Legalization.
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:43:47


meaning keeping it illegal
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:24:01
So playing semantics and effectively not doing anything constructive. Libertarians should put personal liberty at a higher priority than reducing federal action. He's doing the opposite.
@_date: 2015-05-11 13:47:48
Allowing states to deny constitutional rights is not liberty.
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:29:00
pork means added spending unrelated to the purpose of the bill.  In other words, taking Federal money. No, it is not making it less bad, it is making it worse.
So, for bills that were going to pass anyway, he added a bunch of spending for himself, then voted against it to say he voted against it.  But he still got the money.
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:45:27
so much this...
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:29:58
And Rand has a similar approach.  He talks big, but when it comes to voting, he secretly votes for things he just spoke against, like the TPP, NSA, etc
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:44:28
you support the TPP?  keeping marijuana illegal? Expanded US military?

@_date: 2014-02-15 01:38:14

There was no personal information or doxxing going on.  There was a lot of evidence of fake information, including links to stock photos, etc.

BFL takes almost a year to produce under 200 units vs AM shipping tens of thousands of units in less than a month.  
It doesn't matter how many USB or blades BFL's vaporware is if it never arrives.  They are tens of thousands of units and months behind schedule.

I didn't sell anything today, but you know, the market didn't like the dividend nor the hashrate drop
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:30:58
@_date: 2013-06-30 21:07:49
why do you assume the dividend will remain constant?  It is highly probable that we will see .03 as a dividend, making the APR @ 4.5 around 35%
@_date: 2013-03-17 03:45:41
and in most cases, especially with these super cheap debts, is that no one ever sees any repayment.  Debt collectors are hardly anything to worry about, and really, a small price to pay for not meeting your side of an agreement.
if there was no secondary market for these bad notes, you would see less predatory lending practices.

they own shares on the exchange, and those shares are not locked, so yes, there is a possibility that they have been trading.  there is certainly enough volume for them to do so.

24 hour volume on btct is 1800 btc
On bitfunder, it was 1500 btc.
That's over 3,000 btc traded in the last day.  That far more volume than any other security on the exchanges.  While the orders posted may be thin on either side of the current price, the actual bitcoins being exchanged is quite high.

debt at these stages is not a worry to the borrower.  they have decided not to pay, they haven't been paying, and their credit score has been hit. The damage has been done to the borrower, this doesn't change that.
What this does is perpetuate the practice of selling debt that has no value (no repayment = no value), which keeps the pressure up on the borrower.
If you couldn't sell this debt, because there was no market for it, it would be written off by the lender.  Instead, it gets passed to a new owner that harasses the borrower once again for a few months, until that collector sells the debt to someone else.  Rinse and repeat, until the statute of limitations runs out.
While the intention is good, this accomplishes nothing, except giving lenders and/or collection agencies some money.  
This perpetuates the exact system they claim to be opposing.
It's like buying blood diamonds to protest buying blood diamonds.

@_date: 2013-02-12 06:29:47
They were good when I migrated to them, but got worse as the years went by.  And really shutting down an account like they did without warning was the straw that broke the camel's back.
I only ran about 50 sites with them, but I expect that my sites are up, and if they are ever down, there better be a really good reason, and a strategy for getting them back up.  Site5 failed that test.
So, I like the host where I'm at, now, and their level of support greatly exceeds what I had at site5.  I do hope they treat you right over there.

no, it would balance out, because we could trade btc to ltc, then transfer ltc to other exchanges.

I keep hearing that, but it never seems to actually amount to anything...
And really, they have paid back the IPO a few times over, now.  So, they don't have much in terms of debt, and currently have a market cap around $120M, so I think they do have "infinite financing" as far as bitcoin mining/equipment companies go.

I wish I had bitcoins to buy it!
@_date: 2013-05-22 13:59:31
really?  I missed that.  I never saw a sales report, only that they were selling.
Well, 1.99 btc X 10,000 = 19900 btc / 400,000 shares = .04975 / share. Some of that will be shipping/etc, so let's just round down to .04/share.
Mining profit is about .013.  So, total dividend (if all USB miners sold) could be **.053**
I kinda doubt that all the miners have sold and/or that profit will be included in this week's dividend.  Still, it is something to look forward to.
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:12:35

this week will be considerably lower

If I thought an investment would lose money, I wouldn't buy it.  No one is forcing anyone to buy.  They buy because there is no other option.
Avalon is mining with your purchased equipment, KNC doesn't have anything, and BFL is 9 months behind, barely hit 220 orders.  You claim Avalon is shipping, but they are MONTHS behind orders.  That s not shipping, that is trying to catch up.
AM is the only company that can reliable and consistently deliver mining equipment.  And yes, there is a premium for that.  
Don't like it?  Don't buy it.  But don't act like they are some sort of evil entity because they maximize profit.
They have been selling their Block Erupter Blades without an issue, sold out of what they had.  So, it seems, the market wants what they are selling.  They've likely sold out of the 10K batch of USBs, btc-guild sold out in 40 minutes.
You can't compare KNC to anyone, because they haven't delivered anything but promises.  Stop acting like that has real value.

too bad the American company turned out to be shit.
@_date: 2013-08-21 19:52:56
bitfunder was slower on the AM drop this morning.
@_date: 2013-07-01 04:18:56
like 7500 btc per week with mining.  When equipment sales are in full swings, they can double that, so like 15,000 btc per week.
 that's $1,500,000 per week, or $78M a year.
@_date: 2013-07-17 18:42:21
higher risk
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:46:55
but as AM's share of the network increases, it takes a lot more investment for someone else to affect the profit of AM.

just saying...
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:24:35
even if they go down a bit, you still have their worth as equity, and must include it in your payback equation. 
Saying it will take 3 years @ .1/week dividend ignores the fact that you are actually saying 100% profit (doubling your investment) in 3 years.
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:04:35

without AM, they won't even be close to 50%, anymore.

aaaaaaand... it's gone
@_date: 2013-06-29 19:34:15
no, I don't think you are understanding what I am saying.
at 30% APR, the level of risk is acceptable (few alternative investments that are safer with higher returns) for ME.  That means that I accept a 30% annual return when i consider the risks associated with AM.
Back when it was 2.5 and the dividend was .03, the APR was 62%, but the risk was the same as now.  And, if you notice, the share price increased to approach the 30% APR.
@_date: 2013-03-23 18:04:29

I think it points out a weakness in the speculation market of bitcoin, but we should see this as an opportunity to address and confront weaknesses like this in the bitcoin system.
Weaknesses like this must be addressed, and bitcoin, as a currency and a community, must learn that overcoming issues like this makes bitcoin stronger.
So, our exchanges are a bottleneck, there is consolation, centralization, which creates a weak point.  How do we deal with it, folks?

I don't know that bitcoin can be a preventative to Corporatism, really.  Concentration of wealth will occur, and with it will come influence over the economy.  Even in the infant stages of bitcoin, we can see this happening (mtgox, satoshi dice). While they are not influencing state affairs (yet), they still represent a centralized form of power within bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-13 13:16:41
does it mean that no one gets fucked?
@_date: 2013-06-22 01:52:18
no, I only posted the truth.  The dividend/revenue dropped by 50%, the share price dropped by 15% in an hour, and the hashrate unexpectedly dropped by 60%.
FC came online, got the hashrate back up, gave us good news, and the market responded.
I am long on AM, but I am also a realist, and will continue to post as I see it.  I predicted the share drop and the later share rise.
edit: thanks!

That's putting it mildly.  Given their track record, it is likely that they will NOT ship your unit in 2 months. or 3 months.  or 4 months.
@_date: 2013-01-29 03:45:29
me too, I like the concept, and I think you could make it into a legit game, where the last persion loses, but only loses, say 5%
@_date: 2013-07-03 05:55:26
KNC and BFL are NOT selling devices.  They are selling pre-orders on devices that may or may not arrive.  $50 per GH is a nice price, TODAY.  In a year or even 9 months, it may not be such a great price.
The cost of nothing is always cheaper than something.
No one is claiming nobility, but acting like they should not sell a product for as much as the market will pay is ridiculous.  Where else can you get a miner next week?
People buy all sorts of things that never make ANY btc.  If people don't think its a good deal, they can get in line and wait a year for a competitor to deliver a product.
@_date: 2013-02-12 01:50:11
I don't like Site5.  I was with them for years, and their support and service just went downhill.  Then, one day, they kicked off one of my accounts for resource usage, and never told me or anything.  There was no warning, just blocked my website.
When I asked them about it, they just said, well, that's the way it goes.
So, I moved hosts (they don't take BTC, either), and I am completely happy with my new provider.

and yet, you are blaming the sell off on me!
@_date: 2013-06-16 16:11:48

I think a lot of us are in the same boat.  And for merchants, this sort of functionality offers a lot of convenience.
@_date: 2013-06-30 22:29:38
what competitors?
in the mining realm, AM is ahead of all the pools by a growing margin, now.
In the manufacturing realm, AM is the only company that can deliver a product within a week or even a month.
There is no competition.
power consumption, to date, has not been a driving factor in the market.  Price and availability, are.  It doesn't matter how well project chips are if they never arrive.
But, we are talking about the value of the share right now.  And right now, they are the leader of the industry, with growing profits, growing infrastructure, and a several month lead on any real competition.  They are providing a 30% APR with their dividends, and nothing even comes close to that.


Not in the long term.  Compare buying a BFL miner 8 months ago vs investing in AM 8 months ago.  And where do you suggest we buy a miner right now?
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:51:55

You should probably read this thread: 
  - they are mining about 950 btc a day right now, more miners coming online every day.
 - they get their money from mining bitcoins and selling mining equipment.  Costs include electricity, hardware, development, reinvestment, etc.
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:24:00
they will keep from earning like that because other miners will be coming online.  Their target is around 30% of the network.  If and when competitors ship, then everything changes, and there is no way they will get close to even 50%, much less 80%.
If they get more than 30%, they'll probably sell mining equipment to encourage others to mine.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:57:41

@_date: 2013-07-13 01:38:55
no, what I am saying is the volume is so low that to actually realize profits (and certainly not the 25% profit like what was said in the title) on a decent amount of btc, SELLING is not the route to go.  Sure, you could buy low/sell high, just as with anything, but the massive dividend was not a free profit giveaway like a lot of these threads imply.  And you are not dealing with much btc, either.
Can you make a profit with this stock? yes, you can, but it is not as easy as just collecting a 25% dividend, cause the share price drops significantly, too.
@_date: 2013-06-22 03:51:14
it dropped to 2.56 on BTCT
@_date: 2013-06-20 04:52:05
even the mining revenue dropped 20% this week.  That, over everything, is supposed to remain fairly stable.

@_date: 2013-04-25 20:38:06
so, for that to be true, they are just driving the price down when the market is shallow only to let it bounce back again later, right?
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:07:00
you can buy cheap ones right now at a flat rate of 2.4 on the bitcointalk.org forum.  So, sell your 200 slowly around 2.6-2.8, and then buy them back at 2.4.
If it is worth your time at lower margins, then sell at 2.5, buy at 2.4.

Dividends are paid weekly. Dividends are profits paid to shareholders.  Some weeks, some profits are held back for reinvestment.
Profits include mining and hardware sales.

yes, I think it is.  The dividends will likely double next week, and they have multiple profit streams lined up.
Just last week the price topped 1.3 btc.  I think at the current price of 1.16 is a great deal.  This company is going places.

did it drop?  no.  share price is stable

@_date: 2013-05-08 22:43:35
well, that depends on a lot of things.  If you want a ASIC next week, AM is the only one delivering.

it's floating at 20% of the network, it could easily double the mining capabilities and not threaten bitcoin.

we already had that, and then we had panic buying...

about 1 in 50 customers are able to buy from them, if you follow the forums and this reddit.  That's hardly reliable or dependable.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:40:39
I heard about it last year, but got serious about it in Jan '13.  I started earning free bitcoins when they were worth $16.
I had about $5K that I could have thrown in at that time, worth about $60K today.
Still, I'm up a lot for my $500 investment.
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:28:27
hahaha, that's funny!  Is that why the price on the PTs drop every time there is a big auction like that?
well, if you have 400 shares, you can pull out of the PTs and sell on the auction, and the market price stays stable, so your point is not really valid.
@_date: 2013-06-29 14:31:44
well, it jumped past 3.56 this morning, was around 3.44...

yes, it could come true.  I don't know the exact probability, but there are a number of ways this could happen.
But realistically, let's just be happy it hits $100 this year...
as to your original question, yes, he is crazy.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:59:32
if all banks are hacked, what happens?  What about the credit card network?
if all of paypal is hacked, there won;t be enough insurance to cover the losses.
you're comparing individual accounts hacks vs a network hack. So, look at a network hack on traditional systems and see what happens.
@_date: 2013-02-06 15:23:16
that's something you can influence, tho
@_date: 2013-06-16 00:59:23

oh, you are talking about the USBs.  That's not the only thing AM has sold, in fact, they haven't even sold those.  The blades they sold are already mining.
I wonder how that BFL will perform in 2 months after AM has dropped 250 TH/s into the network...
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:10:06
yeah, I know what it is called, but why is no one doing it?

just because there are obstacles doesn't mean they can't be overcome.  Other companies do this sort of thing regularly, so it is quite possible, though you need to figure out the details.

@_date: 2013-05-14 13:41:59
this week will be a great dividend, more than last week.  Mining profits are about .015 per share, and I believe auction profits are about .03 per share.
They will probably keep some of that for reinvestment, but a dividend of .025 is possible.
Bitfunder has the cheapest prices right now:

@ 2.1% dividend per week?  ha!  
You'll see shares hit 2 btc within the next month.

those are different market orders.  So, you could order 100 shares @ .08 btc each, if you wanted.  But, if you want 1500 shares, the first 1400 would be .08 btc each, and then  .099 for the last 100.

$6K 8 months ago would have bought about 500 btc.
500 btc would have bought 5,000 shares in the IPO (.1 btc/share)
5,000 shares are currently worth 12,500 btc ( btc/share)
12,500 btc is worth $1,525,000 (
so, buying a board seat in the IPO at $6K would be worth $1.5M today (plus dividends)

power consumption matters, but it is not the driving factor with ASIC devices right now. It certainly doesn't matter for products that are not on the market, yet.  That's what I am saying.
AM wins the vendors category because they are THE ONLY ONES SELLING products.  Blades will be sold in the coming weeks as well, but it doesn't matter, because no other company is even delivering a product within a reasonable timeframe.
**Here's the bottom line: you are not competition until you are actually competing, and that means delivering products within the same timeframe as AM (less than a week)**
The fact is that the competition is NOT keeping promises, and AM is.  That is why their share value is high and will continue to be.


yeah, I keep hearing this statement.  March, April, May, June, now the fall, soon it will be winter, and then it will be 2014...

Current state of AM:
For the week 1-8 May 2013, the dividend was 0.01108519 BTC per share.
**Dividend projections**
As of this moment, ASICMINER is operating 18,530 GH/s of hashpower, which is estimated at current difficulty to produce 5,825 BTC per week, after 10% fees/maintenance, or 0.0145 BTC per share per week.
If ASICMINER continues to grow at minimal rate of 3 TH/s per week, we will see at least 21,530 GH/s of hashpower, or 6,768 BTC next week, which will be 0.0169 BTC per share.
If ASICMINER grows at 7 TH/s per week, the dividend will be approximately 0.02 BTC per share.
If ASICMINER meets top growth rate estimates of 10 TH/s per week, the dividend will be approximately 0.0224 BTC per share.
**The latest news up to 8 May 2013**
* 200 TH/s has been ordered for 2-3mo deployment timeframe.
* USB devices fully tested, 10,000 units ready for order at 1.99 BTC each.
* Block Erupter sales have produced an average of 50 BTC per unit, or a total of ~2500 BTC in the latest auction.
* If 10 TH/s is sold as planned in Block Erupter auctions at 50 BTC per 10 GH/s unit, Bitfountain will receive 50000 BTC, which is a healthy 0.125 BTC per share in dividends.
* 50 TH/s is estimated to be fully deployed by June of this year.

actually, while I support the intent, this just supports the establishment.
Think about it.  They are buying bad debt that would have never been paid off.  So, they are buying those losses from the lenders.  This rewards the lenders by giving a value to their bad notes.  This is highly beneficial to lenders.
It has no real effect on the borrower.  They wouldn't have paid it off, anyway, and it still is on their record as a bad debt.

@_date: 2013-07-13 00:50:19
ok, dude, chill out, I don't know what your problem is, but just look at what you are saying.
You are saying you sold about 11 btc worth of SELLING today, and this thread was about buying right before the dividend (price around .033-.035) to make 25% profit.  If you bought right before the dividend, and sold after, you stand a good chance of losing money, or at best, making a few percent, definitely not the 25% profit in the title.
If someone had followed the advice here, and bought, let's say, 10 btc worth of SELLING at the time of this thread, they would have received 300 shares, at best.  So, they get their 2.4 btc dividend, and then they want to cash out.
Whoops, price is now at .027, except if you actually want to move 300 shares, then it drops even further.  So, even if they got the .027 price, they get 8.1 btc of their 10 btc invest, plus 2.4 btc, so in the end, they make .5 btc.
.5 btc profit on 10 btc is 5%, not 25%. And if you sold at certain times today, you would have lost money.
My point is that most people that want to move decent amounts of btc can't do it through such a thinly traded security without causing huge price swings.  And if you try, you risk losing your principal.

as long as your ignore the share price, which has been steadily increasing.
If you take the share price into account, as long as they are paying decent dividends (more than 0.5% a week), the share prices will continue to increase.
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:07:18
it depends on the scale.  If you have more than 5-10 full shares, you will destroy the market of the partial shares.
Also, partials tend to be more expensive than full shares.
@_date: 2013-06-19 15:41:17
probably close, it might be a bit higher, but I doubt we go much over .02
@_date: 2013-06-25 05:10:11
yeah, I see what you are saying, but that's number of shares.  If you look at where the volume was higher, we are significantly more valuable, now. So, the daily volume in btc is probably higher now (I certainly remember a time where 500 btc in a day was good)

It's a road block for most Internet users.  In the age of instant payment, waiting days for things to verify when you just want to buy something in btc is a no-go.

@_date: 2013-06-26 14:30:07

@_date: 2013-12-05 17:14:54
I read the full analysis, and I feel that they have seriously underestimated the market potential. They compared Bitcoin to Western Union and focused primarily on e-commerce.
What they fail to realize is that bitcoin is not JUST a Western Union killer, it's a Credit Card killer.
So, let's look at the market cap with 10% of the CC market included. The industry claims $150B annually, so 10% of that would be another $15B on top of the already $15B in the analysis.
And that's really just one market overlooked.  Bitcoin has significantly wider applications.
That's a $30B market cap, and really just scratching the surface. Even then, that makes bitcoin worth at least $2,600.
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:42:41
drugs may become a wedge issue in upcoming elections...
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:40:28
because BTC is a cheaper transaction network than the CC 3% on merchants.  That's why.
it's not about replacing the CC network, it's about stealing business from it. Woo estimated 10% for other markets, so let's say 10% for the CC market as well.  That's another $15B on top of Woo's $15B, giving Bitcoin a fair market cap of $30B.
@_date: 2013-06-19 16:47:17
50% decrease in dividends...
@_date: 2013-07-13 02:05:36

there were some good ones in there
@_date: 2013-07-12 17:05:34
SELLING was at .035 right before the dividend.  Last trade was at 0.0212.  That's a 31% drop in value.

@_date: 2013-07-03 03:41:41
why not?  they have no competition and have 1000 TH/s in the works by the end of the year.
Hardware will likely become the focus as mining revenue decreases
@_date: 2013-06-29 22:28:33
yes they have.
They have initiated production on the last 100 TH/s of the 260 TH/s total production.
Where do you think the components for blades and USB miners come from?  thin air?
@_date: 2013-06-16 05:47:12
they've been higher than 20%, and have been at that level for quite a while (April, I believe).
The only difference is that they used to be in pools.
@_date: 2013-07-10 14:46:17
AM mini blades are going on sale for ~10 btc: 
You'll be able to get those sooner than anything else (except the USB miners)
@_date: 2013-06-29 20:02:00
they can only buy full control of the board if full control is for sale, and it hasn't been. So, that's not a realistic risk.

AM shipped a few thousand units last week.
BFL shipped 15.
@_date: 2013-06-29 17:05:29
but they have produced considerbly more, since they are mining with 40 TH/s or more right now.
So, even if BFL has produced 10 TH/s (doubtful), they are several times lower than what AM has produced in less time.
@_date: 2013-07-12 19:22:37

@_date: 2013-06-25 04:56:40
low demand
@_date: 2013-06-16 06:15:36
how do you know?  they also spend a lot on development
@_date: 2013-03-17 00:42:11
so why reward the lender by purchasing their bad assets?
@_date: 2013-06-26 15:22:21
well, mining revenue is .01577, so that means that they would have to sell a lot of hardware to make up the difference.
@_date: 2013-05-03 00:01:52
so buy 8 and pay someone to set them up for you.  The thing is, you still get in at current difficulty.  Waiting on BFL costs money.
Alternatively, put $31K in ASIC Miner shares, and enjoy .5% dividend a week (plus share value)
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:53:22
that's been the rate the price settles towards for a while.  Based on the amount of risk and proven track record of AM, 30% seems to be what the market deems is a good return for AM.
Now, if other news comes out, like the new hardware for sale, then I think the market will settle for a bit less, maybe even down to 25% APR

BFL has shown that they can't deliver on time, and in the mining industry, that's a big deal.  Their credibility is all but gone, and no one actually believes new orders will ship 3 months from now.

People are selling a 400-500 a night on the auction board.
Also, someone is selling about 3,000 for 2.4.  It is a day old, and they are down to about 1500.
So, not as difficult as you think.
@_date: 2013-02-02 01:58:37
well, you get 1.1X investment, with 96% chance of winning, so you can tell if it is worth it.
I say it is a dent bet.  Similar odds on SatoshiDice gains 1.004X payout.

yes, I agree.  Something simple that manages a everything for them, so they enter an email, password and funding source.  Kinda like paypal.

There is a growing concern that the sheer volume of Satoshi Dice transactions pose an unnecessary burden on the network. While not a direct concern right now, it could become one.  
Mtgox has a lot of control on value of bitcoins.  Look at what happened to the price of bitcoin when they got hacked.  Is it inconceivable that they could influence the market to their advantage?  
While we "control" the money supply, that is but one aspect of the equation.  Corporatism and the dangers of extreme wealth concentration will still be issues with bitcoin.

I could probably try, but in the end, they can afford better lawyers than me.
$10,000 isn't a lot of money to a lot of people, but it is a lot of money to me and my family.  And that's what makes the situation really sting.  The ones that do well out of this situation are those that are breaking the law, and those of us that are following the law don't really have any recourse.
As a small silver lining, I guess I can count it as a loss on my taxes, not that that really helps us much, but it's better than nothing.

really?  where?
@_date: 2013-08-22 05:31:50
We have collected several shareholders' questions for answering.
**Could we have an official live hashrate meter from ASICMINER?**
We have an internal one, mainly for troubleshooting when some of the racks going down. The hashrate meter based on the blocks mined reflects more of the real speed (plus luck of course). We will buy more bandwidth before making it accessible by the whole internet. It also requires more commitment in maintenance.
**For more transparency, is it possible to share a wallet address for depositing income from ASICMINER hardware sales?**
We use a different deposit address for each payment transaction. But a centralized nexus address is good. Then people could see how the funds are separated as dividends and expenses.
**Besides mining, hardware sales, and franchising, are there any other potential sources of revenue?**
There are many possible ones considered, but none can support serious sound business model based on a 1-2billion dollar total market value of Bitcoin: selling patents, offering solution for mining farm construction, assembly service, etc.
**Why has the hashrate dropped the past weeks?**
It dropped in different few days. Some of them are internal hardware/network glitches, some of them are luck based. We haven't identified any form of DDOS attacks recently though.
**There hasn't been a huge hardware dividend payoff: is it because of reduced margins, or delays?**
Because we are collecting funds to get ready for the exponentially increased devices to be assembled in September and October.
**How are things going regarding your business plan? Did you account for the sudden network hashrate increase? How is the international expansion of ASICminer coming along?**
The business plan is unchanged. The network hashrate increase was still under our projection. The total hash target originally set for the end of this year would probably achieved earlier.
The ASICMiner expansion via franchising is still much within China border. The internationally deployed portion will dominate when the gain of operation cost outweigh the delay and cost of international shipping/assembling abroad.

first of all, it is 100% increase from 2 weeks ago (price @ 1.36), not 1000%.
Look at the amount of dividends, and the performance of the company. These shares are still undervalued.
They were severely undervalued 2 weeks ago...  That doesn't make it a bubble, it means that we are getting close to the true value of the shares.

I use paypal on amazon all the time, but not because of Amazon being able to accept it.  I use my debit card from paypal to pay on Amazon.

It has to be more seamless than that if we expect anyone to really use it.  Have a bitcoin debit card would definitely help, IMO.

they claimed because it was a fraudulent transaction.  To be honest, they gave very little details about their decision making process and why they deemed it fraudulent.
I supplied data from the people that made the transactions, and they confirmed with receipts, phone numbers, etc.  The bank contacted the person and they affirmed that it was a legitimate transaction.

I think you are confused as to how odds work.
Statistically speaking, you have a 97% chance of getting 1.1X payout (winning), and 3% chance of triggering a reset (losing).  There is a history published on the site of all transactions, go see for yourself. 
It's the same with any betting game.  You don't think casinos pay the winners from their own pockets, do you?  Those that lose are what funds the winners PLUS the house edge, which can be as much as 10% in a normal Casino.
The odds for this game are generated by a simple formula generating a random number, and then comparing the generated number with a predetermined number to give the odds.  It's the same method used by most Bitcoin betting sites (like Satoshi Dice) to give the user the odds desired.
The result is not .97 X 1.1.  The result is that for 97% of the players, the result is 1.1 x their bet.  For 3% of the players, the result is 0.

well, technically, it is not the last person holding, it is the person that generates a reset.  This is done similar to Satoshi Dice, where we take the transaction hash and address and generate a random number.  If this generated number "hits", then you lose.
Odds of reset are currently set at 3%.
With gambling, someone always has to lose.  In this game, we have a lot of winners and very few losers.  With other games (slots, roulette, dice, etc) you have few winners and a lot of losers.

not going to happen. .025, at best
@_date: 2013-06-30 22:11:25
except that they are currently the leader in mining equipment sales and production, and mine about 25% of all bitcoins, drastically ahead of any competitor.
They are keeping up quite well, and this week, we learned about the plans for 1000TH/s before the end of the year.
dividends are increasing, as this week will include more equipment sales, and we'll probably top .025, which puts the APR around 30%.  I challenge you to find another bitcoin security with similar APR and risk profile.
so, you get to ignore the share price in your break even scenario?

the thing is, the FBI or other agencies are not throwing much attention or effort towards Tor or Silk Road.  You start assassinating Presidents, and they will.  It's not a matter of the networks being secure, it is a matter of the entire process at some point will have a weakness that can be exploited.  And if you are the number one focus for an agency like the FBI or NSA, I guarantee they will find that weakness.
Don't get me wrong, I find the idea interesting, I just think there are significant disadvantages to it being successful.

@ 4.3, it's earning close to 30% APR if you follow the average dividend.  That's why it's holding around 4.3.  Where else can you get return like that for the same risk profile?

basically, they claimed to be mining with 2TH/s since Sep 10.  Today was the day they were going to post evidence of this.
Instead of posting evidence, they posted photos of unassembled chips and boards, and admitted to not mining and being behind schedule.
Their advice to shareholders?  "hold until 30/10/2013"

volume is way lower on TAT-ASICMINER.  If you drop 5 btc worth of share on there, you rock the price.
If you drop 5 btc on the main AM PT, no one would even notice.

dude, STFU
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:58:39
someone just put up a sell order at 2.47 for almost 400 shares.
people sell 400+ shares on a daily basis in the forums, and the price typically exceeds market price.
If the price on the exchanges starts to drop like that, you will see massive buy orders spring up to catch it.
I see what you are saying, the buy orders are currently thin, but if you think dumping 400 shares will actually drive the price to .01, I suggest you prove it.
@_date: 2013-06-24 23:32:50
I'm not trying to fight you, I'm just saying, 3,000+ btc is decent volume.

@_date: 2013-05-13 22:31:22


dividends should increase in the short term, this week looks to be even better than last week.  Dividends are rising faster than share price, though.
Many people use dividends to reinvest, as a simple roll over.  At current dividend rates, you are looking at a 40+% APR, which is a very nice return.
Bitfunder is a bit cheaper on share price, but all PTs are good.
@_date: 2013-08-21 19:20:53
why not just look at the history on both exchanges?
@_date: 2013-07-13 00:14:30
plenty?  how many btc?
@_date: 2013-06-16 15:22:33
yes, it is possible, but don't expect that to earn more revenue.  They'll be doing good if they can maintain 20% of the network, or about .015 btc per share per week.  If they can maintain that through August, they will be doing great.
@_date: 2013-05-22 15:29:47
I think we can reasonably see 3 btc in the next 2 weeks.  Above that, and it starts getting bubble territory, unless AM releases some new developments/hardware/ideas
@_date: 2013-02-06 06:24:19
It's a game, people like it.  
There's another one that's almost 12 btc, but it doesn't reset: 
And a similar game, but resets and has better odds than the Gem, and it runs 3 games at once: 
Each one of these seems like a better play than Satoshi Dice, as far as payouts vs risk go.
