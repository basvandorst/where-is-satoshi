Good job dude looks like you were right. 12.4K right now :) 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:14:22
I don't why I keep seeing 12.5k as a significant number or the market goes bearish but looks like we might get there before the days over after all.
Edit: 12.6k as of right now. SO according to you does this mean we are now going to go bullish?

@_date: 2018-01-18 01:34:29
Yeah that's a good read and pretty much what I think is going on as well. We will see when the price rebounds.
This guy predicted it pretty spot on. Shits coming true as we speak.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:07:18
Lol it might actually hit 12.5k before the days over look at that. Not that the article you posted means anything in the first place.

It's not hard to HODL when you realize how valuable an invention Decentralized trust is. Name one system in our modern world that wouldn't benefit from decentralized trust.  The future is decentralized. Once discovered this technology won't just go away.
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:56:46
It hit 20k for less than 24 hours. Try harder troll.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:29:58
Same things were said about the internet  before www. The internet started on military installations and was barely usable compared to it's current state. Bitcoin was the invention of decentralized trust and its just as groundbreaking and world changing tech as the internet. This tech wont go away now that is been discovered.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:08:48
The new investors are freaking out and theres new blood all over the floor. Whatever happens this is a right of passage that any longterm investor has had to go through not once but multiple times. HODL.

Actually you said bag Holders would be broke in 3 weeks, actually you originally said next day then stretched it to 3 weeks. Its been 4 weeks and  bag holders arent broke. Seriously grow up lol you are embarrassing. I have numerous posts about not panicking during corrections or dips going waaay back because ive seen them and how people like you react to them numerous times already. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:54:49
Just hit 12,200. What's up with this 12,500 number though why is it important?
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:30:49
Easier once you realize Bitcoin and other crypto are currencies not companies. Each have value sort of like gold, platinum, silver etc.  Bitcoin is the first decentralized trust  digital asset and the leader and that has value in itself. Also Bitcoin can and is being upgraded and has the largest most talented developer team over any other crypto by far. Its anti fragile has survived for over 9 years and gets stronger with every failed attack. Its headless leaderless and because of its nature of being completely decentralized can't be stopped ( example liberty coin). No alt will supplant Bitcoin unless it is also decentralized and has a larger more talented dev team. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:50:14
Yup, its a right of passage. All the greedy and FOMO investers who jumped aboard while price was pumping to 20k in 2 months and are panicking now will either become one of us or die off before next rally. Has happenned before will happen again. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:12:57
Could be whales and planned market manipulation tied to futures. The run up to 20k was very strange.
Also this dude predicted this a month ago. Seems to be coming true. 
I guess we see tonight and tomorrow if it rebounds.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:26:26
Msg me at sub 5k then . Like I said im not worried. I was ecstatic when bitcoin hit went from 1 - 10k which took 9 months. This rapid 2 month climb wasnt sustainable and I already expected a correction. I got in at 300 a coin, even if they goto sub 2k im still up and I still made money. Its gonna have to goto zero for me to be broke which it wont. Watcg when the real rally after this correction comes. Stop messaging me until its completely dead if you want to say I told you so , you are wasting yiur time searching this hard for validation. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:19:47
Of course it can be upgraded, thats what the dev team is working on. Just like the internet when it first came out and was only available on military installations to where it is now. Bitcoin is the invention of decentralized trust. Its never  before seen world changing tech and its not going away now that its been discovered. LN is already here and being tested which will solve the scaling issue once its been fully implemented. Moon is the limit after that.

Understand and believe in the tech and worry less knowing that the invention of decentralized trust is not going away.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:46:56
or these two from right after Mt Gox  
I already sent you proof I have been advocating Crypto since 2013 on this same 8 year old account. The second post was before your account was created as well when I bought more after Mt Gox fiasco. I'm done arguing with you I think you are just as dense as you think I am but I'm smart enough to realize this is a waste of both of our times. Don't worry about me buddy I have plenty of income as well as plenty of Bitcoin and it being worth 11k is nothing that saddens me in the slightest.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:56:39
After the Mt Gox fiasco. I bought at 300 and held through 3 year bear market until all the action in 2017.  Still HODLIng but I hope we don't see another extended bear market. That was rough.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:50:24
Decentralized trust. Thats the value. Throughout the history of the world this is the first form of decentralized trust. If you don't see the value in that then I don't know what to tell you.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:54:46
It's crazy how much this place is falling apart. Lots of new blood on the floor. These types of corrections make or break you and learn the real meaning of HODL.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:11:32
Lol if this is worrying you its your own fault. Stop trying to project your insecurities on others. Im set and I dont care that you are freaking out. Considering Bitcoin was under 10k early December no this 50% dip does not mean you are right. You said Id be broke in 3 weeks...... Like I said if Bitcoin hits sub 5k then msg me. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:00:43
Don't be. I bought in 2013 when they were worth 300 a coin and they sat under 300 for 3 years until end of 2016 beginning of 2017. For those 3 years no one thought I made a good investment. Point is is that in 3 years from now a 15k whole Bitcoin will be just as unatainable as a 300 dollar one is today. Bitcoin is the future and it will be harder every day for anyone to deny it. The invention of decentralized trust is groundbreaking world changing technology.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:48:26
Decantralized trust. No 3rd party needed to to verify transactions. Anonymity isn't what this is about.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:44:21
We are about to hit 12,500 again. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:44:04
You have no clue what you are talking about. Bitcoin was never about tax evasion or anonymity.  Its about decentralized trust. Let me guess you have never even read the whitepaper?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:59:38
I didn't realize how much new blood there was around here until this dip. The ammount of panic here is at an all time high and the price was under 10k just a month ago in early December. Anything over 1k is still up from where we were just a year ago. Calm down it will recover at some point and based on all the panic around here it needed this correction.
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:00:20
LOL 12.6k. Keep your head up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:48:05
Fuck em they need to bleed to toughen up. Either they HODL and become one of us or they sell and become bitter/ salty haters. Its a right of passage.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:12:01
Well it was so fast compared to rest of the years growth and I just realized this alot of new investors first real dip is what I meant.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:37:54
You can buy a ledger from amazon. As long as you create your own recovery phrase you are set.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:10:23
I've only ever said invest what you are willing to lose from day one. Anyone who bought at 19k and is worried about it is due to their own fault. Don't invest what you aren't willing to lose, simple . Anyone who bought at 19k was taking a big gamble buying in at an ATH. You are insane dude and you are just trying to get under my  skin but I know where you are coming from and its not going to work on me. Take all the W's you want they don't mean anything while Bitcoin is still alive. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:02:22
Its still over 10k whats the point of your comment? The BTC I bought at 300 a pop are still worth over 10k and you think Im worried? The growth from 10k - 20k in less than 2 months was bound to correct. All the new investors who piled on because of Fomo and greed are going through their first real dip and its a necessary part of the process. Not worried , feel free to message me if they go sub 2k Ill admit you were right.
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:03:57

"Investors were out yesterday. Weak hands leave today. "Bag hodlers" are broke tomorrow. Hopefully you took some profits off the table and are ok with losing what you are still holding.
Hodl is terrible investment advice." 
This was your original comment. Lol whatever dude you are fucking nut. Keep trying to revise history but the comment chain is there for all to see.  4 weeks later we are still above what we were in early December not to mention over 1000% up from the beginning of the year not to mention 2013 when I first invested. Voss twins lost 600 million this dip but they are also still way up overall and aren't panicking either. You sound ridiculous dude. It's obvious you got shook this year and previous dips but why can't you take your gains and just be happy? Let those who believe in the tech keep supporting it. It sounds like you are jealous that I am not rushing to realize my gains because I don't need to. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:45:46

@_date: 2017-12-07 23:01:42
Its not a stupid analogy unless your dumbass decides to read it in that context. Im not saying bitcoin is the first cellphone. You're the only dipshit who read it that way. I was equating the technology of portable phones to crypto tech in general as an example of how tech over time develops into something much more usable. I also used the internet as an example. Is your reading comprehension that bad or you just trolling?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:06:29
I sold one BTC at 4am last night  at 17,788 because the price has been bouncing between 17,800 and 16,400 the past 2 days. Today it decides to go up to 18000 lol. At least I bought it back in at 17815, I have been watching it all day hoping it would repeat the past 2 days but when it stayed so flat I had a feeling we might be breaking 18000. You never know it might go back under 17800 now that it has though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:08:02
Who got lucky and was able to buy the dip at under 16k? It hit around 15500 for less than a minute before rebounding back up to 16.9K.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:42:36
Hasn't hit 50% drop you fucking retard. You love to jump the gun and topt yiur horn and its just gonna sting harder the louder you sqwuak when it swimgs back.Even if Bitcoin dropped 94% it would still be higher 74% higher than it started the year at.
Edit: I was right as usual. You can't prove any of your claims. Bitcoin is going back up just like the previous 6 times this year it has done this... yawn.  Foot meet mouth but I dont know if it will fit with all the cock you already stuff in there. When my 6k French Bulldog takes a shit today ill dedicate it to your sorry ass and your shitcoin.

You are the only one gettimg triggered here. Projecting much? A reddit account that is old enough to support your claims may not prove anything but it lends veracity to those claims. Only an idiot lile you would make claims with no veracity and expect people to take you seriously.  I work for one of the richest companies in the world and Im already wealthy in all aspects of my life. Look at my posts im living the dream. You are so far below me scrub you cant even verify a smidge of the bullshit you are spewing.  You're a weak little bitch online and in real life. Message me from an older account then you fucking little bitch, until then you can tell me you own a fucking unicorn and it fucks you in the ass daily for all I care. My 8 year old account with bullish posts about Crypto back from 2013 can be verified. When I got in this game you couldnt even buy alchohol you little bitch. I bet my fucking dog is worth more than your whole fucking portfolio lol. You are a sad little virgin acting tough online because you are a little bitch in real life no one buys the shit you spew. 8 years ago you were 17....... LOL.

Weak hands get shook and end up having to buy back in @ a loss. This has been happenning since the beginning. HODL , dont even look at Bitcoin if its stressing you out for few days to a week. When you check again you will thank yourself. Ive been on this ride since 2013 and when btc was 300 a pop. I dont lose sleep when the price dips I get greedy as fuck. I scramble to find funds to buy more and throw it all into Bitcoin. Never failed me yet.

It's just a table of forecasting using different time periods. This is posted at the bottom of the tables. 
WARNING: Using Moon Math as a forecasting method is VERY dangerous and VERY tempting. I see no reason why we should expect to see past performance continue indefinitely. Don't make conclusion based entirely on what you see on some random post on reddit. It doesn’t matter how compelling you might find this, it's one lens among many. If this isn't already obvious to you, for the love of GOD, start learning what critical thinking is.

@_date: 2017-12-22 06:25:59
The only issue Bitcoin has is scaling right now. Realistically that is it. Once that is solved what do you think will happen to the price? LN is coming in 2018. Layer 2 solutions will solve the scaling issues. Remember when the internet was only used in Military installations or before www . Lots of people said it had no practical use , same with early cell phone tech. I'm not worried Bitcoin and Crypto is here to stay doesn't mean its not going to be a bloody battle to the top.

It's really not stop spreading FUD. Even if they are a scam Tethers  are an ants fart and not the reason for the recent growth. The FUD is that Tethers could cause another Mt Gox. Just stop.

So you are trolling...... if you read what comment I was replying to my comment isnt out of place at all. Yes technology evolves and gets better over time which is exactly what I was trying to convey. Go troll somewhere else you are wasting your time here. I agree with you you are the stupid one here. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:04:32
Actually you are right it was at 19k for a few days. I don't think it actually broke 20k but it may have it depends what exchange you go by. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:37:47

Its breaking out right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:04:41
Lol damn straight just like the little bitch you are. See you in less than that and every time Bitcoin hits ATH's I'll make sure to remind you. Ill make sure to also remind you once bitcoin hits 50k and I retire at 36 years of age. When I buy my house next year with the gains I am planning on realizing once I retire I will also remind you. When I get my Tesla Roadster in 2020 Ill also shoot you a message. Keep on being salty bitch I don't give a fuck about your negativity.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:16:32
Ah gotcha thanks
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:39:12
If its worth over 100k a BTC in 2018 then yes. If Bitcoin goes to 0 in 2018 then no. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:10:26
Ill add this because some of you probably dont know the details of Bitcoins rise this year. 30 - 40% swings happen. Weak hands get shook and stronger cooler heads buy up the coin they panic sell. Its part of the game. Nov 8th bitcoin dropped -25% in a day from 7800 - 5200 same thing happened. Less than a week later we were cruising past 9k , then 10k shortly after that. 
EDIT: Bitcoin is now rallying up past 15.2k. Lets see where this rally ends , Fuck Bitcoin is exciting :).
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:12:45

Exactly you have nothing of substance to say. Ill be here in a month not that  it will even take that long. I'm not the one posting from a 1 year account remember you dumb fuck, my comments will be here. I'm so confident I bought more on this dip like I always do. Ill be reminding you now periodically when bitcoin hits new ATH's , you want to play this game you might not like the consequences.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:24:32
Anti fragile. Money badger dont care. Coinbase failed just like the previous 2 pnd's. Scamming weak hands is a tradition for these shitheads.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:14:55
Beginning of this year I would have been ecstatic to see us close the year at 5k. Lets hope 2018 is just as as crazy as this year was and Im just as surprised at what it closes 18 at.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:18:29
Yup and its going to fail just like the last 2 times. All these Bcashers here tooting their horns and spreading their FUD during the pump will all go silent when the dump starts. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:38:43
I wan't someone to bet a left nut or some genitalia it won't hit 75k in 2018. That always seems to work out well for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:41:29
Why don't we just wait and see what happens? Won't be long, Bitifinex is under audit right now. Ill still be here we can discuss what how well Bitcoin is doing after this all comes out.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:21:11
Rally after the pullback. This has happened 7x times already this year. Around a 30% pullback then Bitcoin shoots over  around 100% or more and new ATH's. This may not be it but I think it will happen before the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:37:18

My boss asked me the same thing this current dip. Asked me to send him a link to the Gemini and we had a 15 minute discussion on Bitcoin. I have been sending him Aantop videos and linked him the Satoshi whitepapers prior this month and he was always curious but this last dip everyone at my work was talking about Bitcoin when I came in. It was not negative either, everyone was trying to sign up for different exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:04:41
Lol not angry just responding in kind. I dont care if some shit head hateful fucker like you wants to argue online. Im all for it. Keep messaging me every time it drops a bit Im gonna do the same when its on its way back up. Its clear how much you are lacking in life by how you act online. The worst parts of your character come out behind yhe anonymity. People like you lose in life regardless. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:36:58
Top was pretty much 18k - 19k but Im not going to sit here and kick pebbles over a 1 or 2k with you. The only reason it hit 20k when it did was due to GDAX crashing and I was watching it when it did so I don't really count that. It is gambling, no one knows when Bitcoin will rally back up or when it will dip or how low it will dip. You may get it right some times but other times you will get it wrong. Much less stressful for most to just HODL. Do what you want though, like I said again i'm not against someone trying to time the market or for securing profits etc. If you want to deal with all of that go right ahead. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:42:01
You are going to have to ban them like we do here. There is a reason why they are banned and why their sub is just full of shill and sock puppet posts. They will scream censorship but they are batshit crazy so fuck them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:07:54
I bought in at 14200 for this dip. I think thats gonna be close enough to the floor. Remember people we were celebrating over 9K less than a month ago. Don't get all scurred when we have a correction. Bitcoin price spikes then dips then stabilizes and then spikes again higher and higher. This is what Bitcoin has done all year from 1k to 20k. Then you also have Ver and his shitcoin cronies pulling shady shit everytime the difficulty adjust and you get bigger dips. Doesn't matter price stabilizes at a floor then spikes back up higher than previous ATH. You aren't going to convince people who have been watching it do this daily this whole year and profited off of it otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:06:03
It's not weak to sell at the top if you know what you are doing and understand the risk, so no. This is for weak hands the non traders who are panic selling now. By all means play the market if you  know the risks but very few sold at 18,000 compared to who are panic selling now and if you did you got lucky this time, next time is not guaranteed. Usually most people who do try and time swings would have made more just HODLing but not in all cases. You are essentially gambling. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:36:09
Gj dude you understand what yiu are getting into and you will be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:13:25
This is the same as the last  2 Bcash PnD's. You idiots are always here spreading your FUD during the pump end up getting really quiet and humbled once the dump starts. Been there, done that, bought the t shirt brought it back. Ill be messaging you once you realized this PnD is over as well.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:43:14
No, just on your gains or profit each time you sell into USD. So the first  time you sell you would pay Capital gains on the 1k profit. Then when you rebuy at 11k and sell at 12k will have to pay taxes on the 1k profit you again made. Short term is 40% and longterm (over 1 year) is 15%. This is just in the US. I'm not a tax expert I am just  pulling this from the post I linked in my other comment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:37:04
You have a right too. When it rebounds and goes back up or stabilizes still up from last week ill be doing the same to you.
Edit: get ready to be humbled.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:09:10
If you did this yesterday you could have bought back in at under 16.5k. Same as day before. Today unfortunately price stayed flat and now is rallying. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:18:55
Ill be here in 3 weeks we can discuss the price then. It's obvious the only nerves touched here were in your insecure little bitch head.  You are a fucking kid you just graduated and you aren't even employed. Maybe pay off your student loans before you act like you are Crypto rich. You barely have any hair on your fucking balls and you act like a total smug bitch. You haven't hit my levels of smugness you are years behind. Keep hating on those above you, im sure thats worked for you so far.  Deep down you know you envy my shit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:26
Bag holders broke tomorrow? LOL ok buddy let's just wait and see. 
Edit: This here folks is an example of a weak hand. Dude lost 28% of his portfolio trying to trade into alts when Bitcoin was crashing and bought back in at a loss and still made money due to crazy bullish gains this year. Now he says HODLERS will be broke in days and further spreading panic. Don't listen to this loser who will again be buying back at a loss when bitcoin goes the opposite way.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:49:47

All I see here is you burning yourself trying to trade into alts. Its easy to make money in a bull market even if you make stupid moves. Can you even admit that if you just held BTC you'd be even further ahead?  Im also hundreds of thousands ahead from HODLing. I would also still be hundreds of tbousands ahead if I made stupid moves like you did.   Ill continue to HODL and my comments will stay here. See you in 3 weeks.

Why don't you click on the OP's name look at his submitted posts and look at some previous daily Moonmath charts of which there are plenty and you can find your own fucking answer. Might be easier to find the answer you are looking for if you look at previous charts maybe?
Or maybe lower your expectations for something called a MOONMATH chart..... of course it's a silly source. I have a feeling you go around kicking sand in peoples picnics in your real life, lighten the fuck up. I mean the chart even has a warning saying not to trust it like that so I have no clue why you wasted your time posting any of your comments. Argumentative fucking twat.
Here's one from September. 5k and 10k were both predicted on some charts close to the days they actually hit those ATH's.

You are fucking mental and I can tell you live on negativity and being an overall toxic peice of shit. You have 0 reading comprehenshion no wonder you had to read Mastering Bitcoin numerous times front to back. That comment about the Roadster actually proves I have enough to afford it but yes at current point it would cost almost my whole stack to afford a 250k car. When it actually comes out in 2020 if I can comfortably afford one I will be getting one. Fuck you what the fuck do you drive you salty jealous fuck? Thats right you just graduated and aren't even gainfully employed...... Probably driving a car you parents helped you buy or riding the bus.

Fuck you bitch, this was from 2013 when Bitcoin hit 1k. Before your account existed and you were just starting college. Reddit does not make it easy to go back in history and only reason I found this was because it was marked controversial. Suck a dick
Edit:  
You have shit reading comprehension fuck whatever college you just graduated from. You just admitted you traded into alts and had to buy back into bitcoin at a loss. I hope no one in your cirlce takes you seriously you are a fucking idiot. I bought my Subaru WRX in 2012 brand new and before I even knew what bitcoin was. Yes Bitcoin helped me pay it off in full though ;). Also above is your proof that i've been here done that waaaay longer than you. I bought in at prices you wish you had while your ass was  eating top ramen in your dorm. Stay salty you dumb motherfucker.

@_date: 2017-12-22 16:43:52
Not when it goes back up you retard. I doubt you even hold a fraction of what I do. Your account doesnt support your claims. Any bitcoin you bought and sold this year you pay 40% short term. Your account is a year old and you have yet to prove you have been here longer than that. Regardless not listening to idiots like you so far has turned out in my favor everytime. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:56

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:08:54
This was when Bitcoin just hit 1k in 2013. I was just as bullish back then and although my timing was a bit off those deleted comments are cute. was tiny back then compared to now so we used to discuss this on as well.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:51:51
Grow up you are a  are a fucking kid with the attitude of a know it all snot nosed brat. When you are 30 will be embarrassed of your current self. Immature little twat. You couldn't even buy alcohol in 2013 and based on everything you have commented on its clear you missed this train and now trying to act like you actually had capital back then to invest. Be honest you bought in this year with the small ammount of funds you could have earned and are acting hard online because its a feeling you never get to really experience in real life. Prove me wrong or stfu because we know dont have another account from back then or you would have posted from it by now. Little bitch. You were 17 when I first created THIS account lololol. Get rekt or prove me wrong little bitch lololol 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:15:54
Yes it was a dumb move. I'm sending it back to my hardware wallet. Will have to report the Capital gains which is  around what you say since I bought it when it was 300. I did not realize that selling it and keeping on exchange was a taxable event. Not sure how the day traders who do multiple buys and sells are able to work around this.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:49:57
Those that did bother have made incredible gains this year. 2017 has been a nonstop bull market. Those lunatics who bothered in pre 2013 and still hold a significant amount of coin are incredibly filthy rich. If you think crypto is ever going away then don’t fuck with it, but when 2018 is even crazier for crypto than 2017 people tried to tell you, you didn’t listen.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:01:44
Its not my fault reddit only lets you go back so far to see comments. I have an 8 year account I have over  247 posts in and 1269 comments. See if you can find even any of those old comments. You can't because of reddit not me you dumb fuck. You are fucking so stupid you lost Bitcoin trading into alts and had to buy back in at a loss. Same reactionary shit you are spouting now saying Bitcoin will be sub 5k in 3 weeks. You don't know shit you are a know it all snot faced little kid who thinks he is smarter than he is. You don't even realize that if you had just held you would have earned more.
Edit: Proved you wrong , comment is older than your fucking account you little bitch
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:00:15
Really you have been here since 2013 on your 3 year old account? Unlike you my account profile and comment history backs up how long Ive been here. I invested before Mt Gox and Ive been HODLing since. Your comment is hilarious.
was tiny 4 years ago. We used to discuss this in to get a bigger discussion. Also the deleted comment is funny in retrospect.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:43:48
Yeah I'm done trading. It's just better to HODL for me. Especially IF Bitcoin keeps growing at the rate it has this year. 15% of a Bitcoin when it hits 1 million I think Ill be fine paying the taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:21:01
Its a mixture of things that happened and made this correction dip this far including coinbase one of the largest exchanges fumbling releasing BCH that has affected all crypto not just BTC.  But for some context on why this is nothing new this is the 5th 30% correction in 2017.  This should give yiu some perspective.

This should answer all your questions. I'm not an expert Im just qouting this post below from someone who is a tax expert in the US. Basically Crypto is subject to Capital gains tax any time you cash it into USD and this includes even just in an exchange. A lot of  people are under the misconception that you only have to pay tax when you cash out to your bank and that is unfortunately not true and could land you in trouble with the IRS. People are upset Im posting this but it's just good information that everyone should know.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:59:52
Internet before www , early cell phone tech etc etc. When layer 2 solutions come out in 2018 scaling will no longer be an issue. Other issues will come up but Bitcoin has a deep dev team full of extremely bright people working hard to develop the tech. LN is coming very soon the devs have been very vocal about the current progress. You can try a test version of it right now and see how it will work. Bitcoin has survived for 10 years and is entering 2018 at way higher than anyone ever expected. Don't sleep on it, there are already many people who have gotten incredibly rich in 2017.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:20:51
It is. I bought more at 14200 didnt bat an eye at the price dipping lower. Ive learned from these dips that you dont need to time the exact bottom just buy when its low and wait. Profit.

BTC was as low as 100 in  June 2013. I got mine at 300 per in 2013. How do you know this guy bought his at 1000? He could have bought 20 for 100 a pop for all you know. Bitcoin didn't rise to ATH's until Nov of 2013. We've been around here since then and we held through the crash and 2 years of no ATH's. I have friends who bought when I did and they no longer HODL any BTC against my advice. Weak hands get shook. No luck about it, not smart just smug.

You sent me over 5 unanswered messages last night... Whos the triggerred one? Who keeps replying with bullshit while im steady asking you to prove me wrong. If you wont then just stop responding, simple as that. Until you prove me wrong you're a pimly neckbearded virgin posting from your moms basement on your 1 year old account. Show me anything to shut me up if anything you said is true it wouldnt be hard yet you spend more energy just replying over and over like the pimply neckbearded virgin you are.

Lol my friends and coworkers at work wen't from saying "Bitcoin is dead" when it dips to "hey should I buy some on this dip?". This last dip was even crazier. My boss and even people who had been wary to invest earlier this year were all trying to make Gemini accounts and asking me what ETH and LTC are and if they are good buys too. It's your duty as a good friend to make them feel extra stupid for being wrong and then help them when they come around.

It doesn't not indicate future growth either. The saying goes "past performance is not NECESSARILY indicative of future results." but future results are almost always somewhat correlated to the past. Why do you think it's used so often? Almost all investing strategy is based on past performance.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:34:48
Be greedy when others are cautions, be cautious  when others are greedy. If you are new to investing in Bitcoin only invest what you are willing to lose as you have an incredible amount to gain. It's not terrible advice for those who have been in this game or know how to safely invest. For example Last month starting on Nov 8, Bitcoin dropped about 25% from $7800 to $5800. Look where we are now. No one who is a longtime HODLer or believer in Bitcoin is shook that this dip is happening. It will stable out and the price will rise again. We buy on these dips and everyone who did  last Nov is still way up. I initially bought in at $300 a BTC way back in 2013. You think this dip worries me I've seen so many of these on the way to where we are now.  I bought as much as I could at 14200 because I believe that is close to the floor of this dip. What shoots up has to correct in order to keep going up, and Bitcoins rise this year has been meteoric ( under 1k at Jan 2017 - 20k Dec 2017) so it's not a bad thing it corrects and builds pressure for the next rise. Bitcoin and crypto is the future but it has a long way to go. In a week you will all see I was right because regardless the money badger wont be stopped.  Been there done that this is nothing. You think 2017 was a crazy year for Crypto and Bitcoin? 2018 is gonna blow your fucking minds. Bitcoins not the bubble it's the pin. 
EDIT: Suckit 16.4k as we speak and rising. Oh man in 2018 everyone who read my comment and hated on it is going to be salty AF at the missed opportunity.

That is absolutely incorrect. Please do your due dilligence to educate yourself correctly on how crypto is taxed. Any time you convert to USD is a taxable event. If you want to total it all up and report it on one line you can but you better be able to explain each USD transaction if  they dig deeper. Looks like you may  have lots to report come tax time......

There are many reasons why HODLing and just buying more on dips is recommended here over trying to time the market. You may time it right once or twice or even 3 or 4 times but eventually you will get it wrong. No one knows when Bitcoin will rally or dip dramatically. It’s very easy to get caught off guard by the volatility. Another huge reason that a lot of noobs here don’t understand are the tax implications. Assuming you are in the US, any time you sell any crypto for USD it is a taxable event even if just within an exchange. If you held that coin for less than 1 year it is 40% capital gains tax. The only way to avoid paying taxes is to HODL (yiu still have to pay when you cash out). Accounting for taxes and the amount of stress and time day trading takes not to mention just HODLing and buying the dips is more profitable over all unless you are a trading whiz or use a bot.

Yeah losses aren't taxed in fact if you have a net loss for the year you can deduct up to $3000. Although I'm curious how trade volume can be 100x greater than a portfolio unless you are just losing money left and right. If you are making profits and that money is going somewhere it's gains and taxable. Trading into Alts is a grey area I guess.

So my math checks out then, GMD pretty much showed the numbers I was getting with my own calculations and I was being generous. Within 4 months it will be generating negative income unless the bitcoin price skyrockets past 1200. No break even within the 1st year so never basically. BTC price would need to shoot way up before he would even come close to breaking even in a couple of months.

I hope so, I am buying a shit load this week to take advantage of the fiasco. By my calculation on GMD it would need to hit at least around 1.8k - 2k for him  to come close to breaking even within a couple of months. He would def make more if he just invested it in BTC directly.

My first Correction was in 2014 when btc shot up to +800 first real rally after thr MT GOX bubble. Then proceeded to correct to under 300 where it stayed for 5 months at least, before it started to rally again. That period it was down was  my first experience with Bitcoin and I was extremely worried an nervous that it would never rally again and die. Well as you all know it didn't and every correction since hasnt fucking phased me in a bit. HODL

@_date: 2017-08-22 22:15:44
It stayed under 300 for a long time too, over 6 months. 3 years later and its over 4k. The new hands need  to calm down. Crazy how many posts I saw about selling  yesterday while it was under 4k and dropping. People predicting it was going to go down to under 3k and to sell now. If BTC corrected and lost over 70% of its value a in couple days like it did in 2014 it would be chaos here with how many new holders would be panic selling. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:05:02

You are not prepared. Get ready I've been a HODLer through watching BTC lose over 70% of its value in a week and stay under 300 for 5+ months. Just forget about BTC when its dropping and trust that it will go back up. It always has.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:31:12
You have your BCC now plus your originsl BTC still. You didnt lose anything.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:32:35
Good advice. Do not spend any more than you are willing to totally lose. The price could correct the minute you press your buy order and then you will learn what it means to HODL. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:20:46
And we are back up over 4k. Not expecting a fall after such steep rise means you are either new or dont understand the term HODL. Ive seen BTC drop from 800 to under 300 in a day and it stayed under 300 for over 5 months. That was 3 years ago and look where we are now.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:33:01
Hopefully some people learned a lesson last night. If you sold on the dip expecting it was going to go lower. Now you can buy back in at 4k or wait for another dip when we might get a rally instead. HODL.

Actually he lost it because he didn't understand how to safely spend from a paper wallet. He didn't understand that spending any ammount from a paper wallet empties that paper wallet and all funds you think you arent spending go to a change address which you then need to send to another paper wallet for storage. It can be very confusing and I can see why this happens.

Dont sell no matter how uncomfortable you get with how low the price corrects. It will stabilize at a floor and you dont want to panic sell or you will lose profits when it eventually rallies to a new  All time high. Hopefully it doesn't drop much further than 4k. If it stays around here for the day then I expect it rallies from here.

The immutability is what's valuable. You dont get immutability without decentralization. They will learn how stupid they are as they go.

@_date: 2019-02-22 23:40:44
They can do whatever they want to try and create immutability but it's only inherently secured if decentralized.  The only working example of an immutable blockchain is BTC that's been proven to work on this large of a scale. They will fail where bitcoin did not because a blockchain is only as secure as its underlying network. This is what these companies are going through. They have moved out of the denial phase into copying. Also you are adding all this fluff to what I'm saying that is completely unnecessary.  Never anywhere did I imply that bitcoin would need 7b nodes. BTC nodes can be created by anyone.

@_date: 2017-08-19 03:41:19
They will panic sell when they see a big correction. Even these tiny little dips have all the newbros in fits. Just like in 2014 if there is big correction and the price drops to 30 -50% most of the new hands around here are going to panic sell no matter how many times they have been told to HODL. Then they will have to buy back in when it eventually rallies to new all time highs. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 01:28:35
"Yes, in theory JPM's leaders/shareholders/board could force all internal nodes to do something, but that's not really what they'd be trying to protect against in the first place."
An example in your own words and yes a group or entity could easily hack  51 nodes and then take control of the system as well. It's happened to some Altcoins. Small number of centralized nodes are not secure as a vast array of decentralized ones that can be created by any living person. JPM nodes will be limited to their closed system.

@_date: 2019-02-23 00:35:22
All speculation. A network is only secure as it's underlying infrastructure. Decentralized = secure. Centralized in any form is less secure than inherently. 51% attacks are simply not possible on Bitcoin blockchain it has immunized itself from them a long time ago and one has never been successfully executed on the Bitcoin network. 
A closed system like the one you are describing will have no defense against any type of majority attack. Since all nodes are centralized any 51% attack will 100% succeed. Essentially they need to figure out or invent a way for their centralized nodes to not be vulnerable, good luck with that. These companies aren't just after a fancy online database, we've had those. The innovation here is the inherent immutability and security that only decentralization provides.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:31:31
What don't you believe?  Theres alot of people here who got lots of BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:12:50
Redditor for 6 months.  Post from your real fucking account if you are going to tout being here for 6 years. As someone who actually has I don't mind them. They really only  just started up again a little before this year and after 2 years of darkness they are a welcome sight. I doubt you were even here in 2013 you salty fuck. Go back to r/btc.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:19:14
It appears so, strap in boys lets get back over 7k!  
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:49:16
Waaaaay ahead of you. Been here since 2013. /high5
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:56:20
 it's this. Hes trolling or not. How long has his twitter profile pic had the same edited gesture? Have you seen his twitter profile pic?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:15:45
Im not trying to criticize your decision and its great you made this much but I can never understand why someone wouldnt put some away for 10 years. After seeing how much you made in this short time and in 10 -15 years a single Bitcoin could be worth more than your total cashout. How can you risk thar possibility when its so simple to store Bitcoin longterm? I could cash out and Id have more money thsn Ive ever dreamed of having at this point in my life but we arent even close to the moon and Im in it for the long haul.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:42:29
Ive been here since 2013. 10k was never the moon. The moon is mass adoption / worldwide adoption.
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:49:49
It wont be immutable due to being centralized.  Can be hacked and forked at will by nefarious entities due to the node centralization. Will be vulnerable inherently to 51% attacks.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:07:35
Thanks, this was a good read and answered my questions. This should be up higher.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:11:13
Thank you. This was a just what I was looking for. Perfectly explains all the FUD r/BTC is now championing behind now that they are coming out of their holes after last weeks flippening/ death spiral failure.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:05:34
The post on r/btc after 6 hours still has less than 120 votes and less than 50 comments.....
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:00:43
Not necessarilly. If he weighed the options and understood the risk and he came out on top he's not necessarily an idiot although it's an indication he might be impulsive or infact an idiot. He could just be ballsy and made a huge play.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:32:54
BTC can handle at max 300k a day  transactions with 1mb blocks. By comparison Visa = 170 million transactions a day. Neither BTC or BCH scales to even be avle to handle 2 % of that volume. BCH has a hard cap of 32mb currently 8mb = 2 million tx a day. A different solution is needed of which BCH has none and core has layer 2 tech coming out soon and devs working on real solutions. BCH can handle the small ammount of transactions right now better than BTC and thats it and not for long all while making the network more demanding, less secure and less decentralized. Its a bandaid and people are fools to jump ship for a bailout when real solutions are in the pipe. Its being used to manipulate weak hands and idiots who cant see the big picture.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:19:49
This is much better than how it was for 2 years after bitcoin dropped 80% and sat under 300. Been here since 2013 and these are bright days in comparison. You don't complain about ATH posts after you sit through 2 years of that.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:55:17
I went over there to post a civil comment over the weekend about their death spiral and got insulted immediately for trying to make a point and I got sucked into retaliating for awhile to be honest.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:25:34
Im ready, 6900 baby! Lets get this weekend bullshit behind us and back over 7k.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:46:25
Yeah it was working right before we passed 7500
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:18:57
Props on the RS. Badass car, Respec.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:38:57
Just wait till coinbase releases the 30% the have held up. That other sub gonna be on suicide watch.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:12:07
Then how do you explain bclashic? Looks like original chainn did fork and survived.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:48:17
Then HODL. Anti fragile honey badger will survive. If the pattern HODLs then in 2019 2020 we are going to 100k.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:20:59
I agree the wait for a real solution is frustrating as hell. Then you have a group that decides to create a new Coin and call it an " upgrade".
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:24:21
They did this exact pump before too like a month ago and all the BCH idiots called it the flippenning. Clearly in retro was a pump and dump shit quickly crashed back to 300 and all the BCH underlings go silent holding the bag. They are easily manipulated noobs a whole sub full of weak hands, its no suprise they fall for it again.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:52:49
yeah , im waiting for it to update too. We hit 7.5k hours ago.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:57:24
They absolutely are that's a huge part of what they are talking about over there. Next time BTC difficulty adjusts they are going to PnD again.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:43:23
Im so happy , this is amazing news. It fucking worked!
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:51:56
I guess I understand but not entirely. I used to be just as neurotic about the price but I learned to ignore it during the 2 years it sat under 300 after Mt Gox. Now  this 2017 is so refreshing im actually paying attention to my holdings again and excited about ATH but no dips even phase me. I just ignore it and next time I check its back up or smashing ATHs. I know where Bitcoins going and the stress of it is gone. Id feel more stress knowing im not holding any bitcoin for when it goes to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:04:09
I think it was 2013 but I put 2009 -2013 to be safe Im pretty sure it was before 2014 but you are right 2009 is much to early.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:24:54
The website got hugged to death but next stop is 10k. Is it going to happen before 2018? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:39:55
oh really professor bitcorn? 8200 as of right now. Lol did you follow your own advice and panic sell?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:06:53
I read your history and I see you are just trying to help people. Im in for the long haul though. If Bitifinex Mt Gox's im prepared to HODL until it recovers if it even needs to. I did through the 2 years it sat under 300. The shit going on at Bitifinex is starting to look very pretty shady but no one knows how it will play out. Tethers are a tiny fraction of the overall.
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:17:29
SO this is good for Bitcoin is what you are saying.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:45:16
LTC and ETH have always recovered from my experience in watching them since 2013. They seem to recover when BTC price is stabilizing or dropping. When Bitcoin is Rallying they usually drop.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:15:32
9k is going to be Vegetta. It better fucking be.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:52:58
I don't know why this isn't being discussed more here. This feels  a little similar to what happened with MT GOX. I was here around then and they made the same kind of assurances right before shit started to go south. I know that other sub is just salty and that's why that have 5+ posts about this on their front page but I can't seem to find any solid info here which clearly makes this FUD.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:38:26
I saw it go over 7550 as well on bitcoinity. Waiting for the website to update but yeah we hit 7500 about an hour ago.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:15:06
Congrats everyone! 8K down , Vegeta next!
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:32:17
This news didn't even get past page 3 on the other subreddit. That itself says a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:47:46
Lol maybe after 2018 the way things have been going. If I can afford the roadster in 2020 its gonna be hard for the wife to stop me. I have a pretty badass 2012 WRX as is. Im happy.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:37:44
No tethers were printed for this rally.  Take your tether FUD bsck to your salt mine subreddit.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:04:21
Your prediction is a guess as is mine no one knows for sure what will happen but no I dont think we will see a 75% correction that lasts over 18 months again. We have a lot of legitimate exchanges and decentralized exchanges now. BTC is &lt; 4 billion in transactions in 24 hours now. MT Gox of 2013 doesn't exist today, Bitcoin survived it and is stronger now because of it. Like I said you won't have to wait long to find out. If you're so confident put up a testicle. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:01:22
Gtfo here with this bullshit. We still got 90% day after your DAA.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:30:16
That's what i've always seen as well. Where else can you store value that is deflationary, unseizable, and decentralized, and this easy to set up or use? This has never existed in the history of mankind.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:01:19
Turns out it's FUD afterall. You guys have been wrong about everything and although last week humbled you all a bit you have found your new FUDtastic piece of nothing to champion behind. It's sad how reactive you guys are over there. Keep being salty shitcoin fools.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:42:27
The flippenning became the humbling. A lot people actually did learn from this weekend and hopefully are ditching the scamcoin.
Seriously get over there they are listening to reason and logic now. I posted this almost this exact comment over there and its getting upvotes instead of downvoted to oblivion. 
There actually good discussions going on right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:52:25
You are right in the end. I got a little loose this weekend due to all the craziness and I'm done slinging shit with the other subreddit now. They did fucking deserve it though with all the bullshit they were doing this weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:18:49
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:37:47
150 away from 8k what a week this has been. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:29:53
I have 4 people exactly same situation at work. One dude since all the way back in 2013 when they were sub 300. Even now they know how much im up they just saying dang should have invested, next time!   
I dont understand people sometimes.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:12:03
Yes and got very close to hitting 7500. 7438 is current ATH
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:15:03
Its the new FUDtastic piece of nothing. Last one was the flippening and if you go back a week they were flooded with expert posts about how that was inevitable too. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:32:52
It's not called the Honey Badger for nothing .
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:30:09
ETH will recover just be patient and you will be fine with the ETH.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:17:51
Well shit Congratulations! Love seeing this on a saturday at work. If this keep up that early retirement is getting closer everyday.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:13:14
Yeah its just best to pretend that place doesn't exist. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:25:24
Damn, I really hope he doesn't do it. I'll feel really bad after  all the comments I've sent him reminding him that this was gonna happen if he really goes through with it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:22:52
Then post from your real account then. Your account doesn't show you as being on this subbreddit for years. You haven't been here since 2013 or you wouldn't be this fucking salty. You reek of r/btc. Anyone who's actually been here since before Mt GOX wouldn't give a fuck about ATH posts. They just recently came back after a long dark 2 + years. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:34:31
That dude is so close to having to eat one of his testicles. 10k is so close to being hit ib 2017. What a time to be alive.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:14:04
Im just waiting for it to update that we hit 7500 :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:00:33
Yeah I got that same one a couple days ago. I just deleted it. Good heads up though. Everyone should know better than to click links sent in PM's as well.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:55:34
They deserve what’s coming to them. Those people are out of touch, fooled and clinging to the fact that their bigger blocks work when there’s no real traffic. A fool and their BTC are soon parted.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:07:51
HODL since 300. Its still going up too 10170 on Bitstamp right now. Are we blasting off to the moon right now?
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:10:49
Audits are incoming very soon as in the immediate future. At this point the internet is not being flooded with Finex withdrawal issues and I don't see a need for concern like everyone in r/btc has been clamoring  about. Lets just wait until the audits. Dec 31 2016, Jan 31, Feb 28, March 31 2017 are released as promised. If you are worried get your money out of Finex and Tether.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:17
Shit now I feel bad. If dude really eats his left ball I will feel partly responsible. Ive been egging him on ever since it got close to 9k.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:24:13
I checked his profile. Dude reminds me of myself but richer. Hes fighting the good fight, I like the cut of his jib. I hope one day to reach the smugness levels this dude gets to enjoy.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:59:00
You're getting brisket you lucky fucker. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:53:07
Well obviously Id be more smug with more but I think 100 is out of reach for me. I am exactly as smug as I should be. I hope to one day reach the smugness levels that you get to enjoy everyday ;).

Just officially hit 7500. This was a success your gif does not apply.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:15:56
Its ok, op was a little early. Pretty sure it passed the last ATH now its just hit 7918.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:27:08
Gemini is much better than Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:26:58
Holy shit! Woke uo to 8650. So excited to see over 9000 today. So close.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:23:14
For 2 years Bitcoin sat under 300. I had to just forget about this sub as most people did it was a dark place. 2017 has been an amazing  year and I love all the ATH posts. 7k is even more than I was willing to bet we'd reach this year.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:08:14
Whats really sad is that 6 hours after the post on r/btc has less than 120 votes and 50 comments.....
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:42:43
No that is not correct. Someone just misspelled HOLD in a famous post from 2009-2013 and it stuck.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:23:46
Pick a year in the future and stick to it. Im not cashing out until I dont have too. I dont think ill be waiting as long as people think.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:20:18
At least you didn't buy into the BCH at 1800. Lots of sour and salty people over in that other sub who thought today would be the flippening.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:27:22
BCH pump and dump seems to be reversing. Monday is gonna be interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:05:33
What kind of people are you around who are trying to get at your 400 euros? A lot of people at my work know  that I have a lot of Bitcoin, I've been talking about and investing since 2013 and not one person has asked for a hand out. A few have asked how to invest etc and have done so themselves but not one person has asked for handout. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:02:51
Is it FUD? I havent heard much on it can you speak more on it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:36:22
Fuck yeah just watched it hit 10k live. What a time to be allive! Also that dude has  to eat his left ball now. Remind him!
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:25:22
Exactly, its not going to be that long of a wait either. These are exciting times.
@_date: 2019-02-23 01:06:03
That is the question. One they will be learning the hard way. Basically they need to solve how to protect their closed centralized system from a majority attack which it will be extremely vulnerable too. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:08:39
This is nowhere near the front page of the other subreddit.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:25:39
I don't have to hope I can plug in my Keepkey and look at my balance. Lots of people here are actually just hoping to get richer.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:16:49
We are gettimg so close to Vegeta gifs Im so excited for the rest of this week!
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:16:47
Its a fucking cesspool over there. They are fucking obsessed with this place and everything is made of salt. Every other post is about r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:40:56
That was a long dark 2 years until 2016. I don't think that's going to happen. Things have changed since 2013 -2014. At least we don't have to wait long too find out who's right.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:47:31
This is exactly how the last BCH pump and dump went. BTC is holding strong at 6500 now. BCH gonna start slipping soon and crash to 300. These weak hands that fell for the Scam coin get burned and it's their own fault.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:24:23
Wasn't trying to be a dick calm down. 10k is like a successfull liftoff. This thing could still crash and burn before even ditching stage 1 boosters. Im excited and 10k is huge in that regard but imo the moon is still far far away and the journey just started.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:38:21
Did everyone goto bed or did they try and short and get burned? If you caught the dip congratz that was a quick one.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:34:12
If you had invested that 7k in January of this year you would have 49K today. To the bold go the spoils. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:05:41
In 2013 it was less than 6.5k. Nobody listened to me back then and laughed when I cashed out company stock to buy and HODL. Ive been a smug mf this year.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:45:37
@ 8200 4 hours later , Lol what you sell at dude? That's why you HODL weak hands get shook.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:05:30
What's FUD is  that it's going to kill or crash Bitcoin in any significant way.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:24:18
No shit but if you make a post like this touting how long you've been here you should post from an account that backs that up. You will get called out on it and no one will take you seriously.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:35:28
This one by far has the better discussions and better information. If you can't tell that you are part of the echo chamber over there. Go try and find the post over there about BitMEX selling all their customers BCH for BTC. Buried on the 3rd page and a bunch of circle jerk posts all stacked on top of it. r/btc is a bunch of idots getting scammed and upvoting shill and bot posts. Its ridiculous seriously the fact you are here means you might still be able to save yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:03:26
It happened. 10k is right around the corner. I have a feeling 2018 is going to be even crazier than 2017. Congrats to everyone who invested and held we are about to see this shit take off to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:03:50
Can you expand on this? How does the new DAA algorithm work against their attacks? Everyone over there are saying next difficulty adjustment they will be able to attack stronger? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:44:31
4 hours later its bsck  6500 my ass.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:21:25
I wish I had bought more. Everyone I told back then called me crazy for cashing in company stock and buying BTC but I still only bought what I was comfortable losing. Seeing BTC at 10k is crazy because if it keeps going up I will definitely be set for very early retirement and just 2 years ago I wasn't even feeling  like that was a real possibility.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:31:34
Salty as fuck. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:58:40
They are trying to calm each other down in the other sub over this news. Coinbase in January too right after Bitmex. I saw one persons "theory" Bitmex already sold the BCH so it wont effect the price..... lol pathetic.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:34:55
BCH DAA now makes this less of a possibility.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:19:07
Thanks appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:43:59
Who says exposing fraud cant be fun?
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:39:01
Crickets in here. Did some of you get burned trying to short? Thats why you HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:15:02
Down there salt is a way of life.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:20:08
LOL, BCH is quickly on the way down now too. Monday will be interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:08:29
Its not stopping. Did we just blast off to the moon?
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:50:37
Same thing happenned when I sold a bunch of my company stock in 2013 to buy BTC at 300. Everyone who was present for the conversation mocked me for doing it. Im the smuggest mofo now and this year has been full of so many Told you so moments for me. Jaws hit the floor when I show certain people what my 7k initial investment looks like nowadays.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:43:58
Same thing can be said about BCH. People are really that  stupid in the numbers required for these scamcoins to get traction.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:25:37
Yeah its an issue that needs to be solved. BCH has no real solution or plans for one we have layer 2 solutions coming out soon. Their bigger block sizes only scale slighly larger thsn BTC in the grand scale of things not even large enough to handle  2 % worldwide digital cash transactions. Oh but it works right now......
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:42:39
4 years? Less than 2 years actually. Bitcoin survived Mt Gox and less than 2 years later rallied from under 1000 - 10k in 2017. So that means in 2019 we go from 10k to 100k. HODL. Anyone can make predictions no one knows whats going to happen moving foward. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:23:27
Still spreading FUD even after its proven FUD. Pathetic.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:42:03
It's fucking Ball munching time!
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:36:43
Can someone speak some more on this? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:58:10
I'm riding it to the ground although I don't think it's ever going there. I held for the 2 years it sat under 300 and was prepared to lose it all then too. I won't sell until I don't have to and I can just spend it directly. Actually if BTC hits 300 a coin Ill consider cashing it all out. That's when I got in and that's pretty much the ground for me at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:45:16
Actually had some good back and forth and discussions wasnt total waste. There is actually a big discussion on the other sub now where they are actually talking about BCH vs BTC again and users ate coming around. This week and weekend seemed to humble them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:17:12
Yeah I will feel bad. Been messaging dude since 9k.

One of the amazing things about Bitcoin is it solves it's own issues through consensus. Fees are no longer an issue bruh and it wasn't bigger blocks it was LN that did it.

HI , I love my keepkey too. Please leave me some BTC when you all decide to activate the backdoor. Seriously though, great product.

Redditor for 3 weeks. Sell your crypto gtfo while you can. Not sad you newbies get burned investing more than you can afford trying to get rich quick.  If you understood what an important world changing tech  distributed ledger / decentralized trust is you wouldn't be freaking out about day to day price. Some of us believe in the tech and got in when Bitcoin was sub 1k or even less and know its just a matter of time. The road to world adoption is not going to be a smooth for any never in the history of world seen brand new disruptive technology, but its inevitable. You cant put the genie back in the bottle once its discovered.

That makes sense.

Because of his attitude. Dude hasn't learned a thing from Mt Gox. Probably lost trying to short Bitcoin. If he had HODLed he wouldn't be so salty.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:06:56
Because its severely undervalued. As the world wakes up to how valuable a technology it is the price is going to continue to rise and eventually skyrocket. This was posted yesterday and ask yourself how much a technology that does everything below is worth. This is a technology that has never existed before.
"Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media. If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it. Check these great articles:
"What Gave Bitcoin Its Value?"
"How do Bitcoins have value?"
Bitcoin is becoming more and more practical by the week, like for worldwide cheap and fast money transfers (remittances) to 3rd world underbanked Countries. Email in the 90's: "It needs to be easier to send", or Internet then also: "It needs to be easier to use". Bitcoin is just beginning but it will have a huge impact, I think the future economy will be digital and decentralized.
Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:
 • Cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (new apps will make it cheaper)
 • Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
 • Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
 • Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
 • Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
 • Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
 • Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
 • Open source (auditable by anybody)
 • Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
 • Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
 • Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
 • Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
 • Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
 • Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
 • Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
 • Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
 • Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
 • No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications. "

@_date: 2017-09-02 02:23:25
Exactly. Even before segwit was activated Bitcoin was a steal at 5k as just a store of value. Look at Gold as a comparison. Bitcoin kicks the shit out of gold as a storage of value alone. Once everyone wakes up Bitcoins market cap is going to explode and people won't believe you when you say you bought a whole bitcoin for 5k.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:04:00
Very few that got in this early held onto any significant ammount of coins. Lots of people got screwed from the mt gox bubble either directly or when they dumped due to the huge correction. Others got scammed via other shady exchanges or when the silk road was siezed, not to mention those that sold at 1k or during the initial Mt Gox bubble. Only the most stubborn staunch believers and the lucky made it through all that to now.    
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:29:00

All you need to know are the fundamentals. Most people only have a very basic understanding of how the internet or email or their cell phone works. Doesnt matter, a valuable technology will be adopted and used regardless of if you understand in detail how it works.

Oh really there is a 100% chance this will pop in 2 days? What do you base this on? You have no  clue what is going to happen just like the rest of us. Bitcoin as far as its utility is concerned is hugely undervalued even at 5k. This is 2017 things have changed since 2013 -2014.

Bill waits a few hours and is now no longer homeless but significantly richer than he was. What's your point here? Just because you didn't HODL through the MtGox bs doesn't mean others like myself didn't. I'm waaaaaay up still because I held strong since 2013. Stay salty. Learn to HODL.

The risk that one of those times you short Bitcoin will rocket the other way faster than you can buy in on the dip and you end up having to buy back in at a loss. It's a big risk and why it's less worry and better to just HODL

Anyone not familiar with China bans  this has happened before multiple times exact same MO. China announces Bitcoin ban, weak hands sell. China buys up the cheap coins then says "Just kidding we no ban bitcoin now" Price goes back up.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:06:39
Ok well thats not the same as what I was talking about then is it?  By definition digital currencies are not traditional fiat in that they  improve and fix issues intrinsic to the Fiat system. And it is BETTER because if it fixes those huge issues such as centralization. Digital currencies like Bitcoin are a BETTER system than the traditional FIAT system because that's what it was invented to fucking do! 
If your whole argument is that fiat and bitcoin are both not commodity money then that should have been your argument. You are still wrong that Bitcoin is Fiat though and flatout wrong that it's not a better system.

Sell half. Always keep some coin for the future. You  will kick yourself when they are worth 100k a piece. Better yet , hold long enough and you won't even have to cash out into USD. Once everyone accepts Bitcoin why the fuck would you use USD at all?
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:34:15
Calm down. Seriously new hands are so easy to spot. We almost hit 5k on a Friday. Weekends are times when Bitcoin slows down and 5k is a psychological barrier. If bitcoin hovers at around previous  ATH through the weekend (4500) then most likely Monday or early next week it will pass 5k.  
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:57:02
Thats why you HODL. Weak hands get shook and either stay salty or buy back in at a loss.

Lets see then. You get tired of being wrong though?

It's nice being able to talk about BTC now in positive light at work. 2013 I was crazy/ stupid and Bitcoin was internet money used to buy drugs online. Now everyone has changed their tune, one guy mines alts and a few others are HODLers and everyone else is interested in it.

OP just picked a number but he might not be that far off. How much would you actually value something that does everything below that the world has never seen before? I say much more than 4.6K and much closer to OPs first number.

Weekends are slow for Bitcoin so it's normal for a rally to not carry through the weekend. Especially when it's a psychological barrier like 5k. The fact the the price is holding at around the last ATH is a good sign.

Yeah I'm not sure where OP is pulling 100k from, Golds current market cap is $8,104,937,227,739. I do think Bitcoin will continue to siphon from Golds market cap eventually eating it almost completely. I'm happy with 21k bitcoins, for awhile that is.

They just get more salty the more you are up.

They still talk shit every ATH although now there are others who have jumped onboard im not the only one.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:46:50
Once in 2014 due to MT GOX bubble. Since it's re rallied it has never corrected like that since. This growth now is slow and steady compared to the Mt Gox bubble rally. Bitcoin haa been breathing , reaches ATH, small pull back then breathes to a new ATH. Its 2017 now and this isnt 2013 -2014 anymore. HODL or you could be one of the greedy idiots left behind when this shit goes to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:14:12
Or end up waiting for a correction that never comes. This is different than in 2013 rally and if you can't tell the difference then by all means sell. For me I HODL. I know where Bitcoin is going and Im in no rush.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:41:43
Wow you must not only be stupid but have some serious mental issues. I will make sure to remind you via this account what a colossal dumbass you are as Bitcoin continues to break ATHs. You're an idiot if you didn't just hold one long term which was my original comment that sent you down this rabbit hole. A comment that multiple people also stated that you even agreed with. Your pussy ass bitch panties got in a bunch and you should be ashamed of how ridiculous my comment has made you act. Keep waving your micro dick around bragging about the BTC you once owned for a short time.   Despite all your posturing and acting tough i bet you are still holding that last one but you're too much of a pansy pussy bitch to just admit i was right.

Ill believe it when I see it. If bitcoin hits  10k I planned to quit my job back in 2014 when I first invested and if that happens this soon I dont know what to say. 5k is waaay above what I thought wed be at at this time.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:03:26
Seriously. All the idiots at my work who fomod and bought in Nov and Dec are all turning on Bitcoin its hilarious. Not one even knows anything about the tech just wanting to get rich and now crying that its not just free money. No patience weak handed  idiots need to go through this and gtfo if they dont believe or care to look at the tech. The invention of decentralized trust is not going away and is going to change the world. If you are too focused on the price to see the bigger picture then gtfo.

Having been here since 2013-2014 where bitcoin languished under 400 dollars for over 2 years and these stopped coming around, I don't care if they are posted every 100 now, as long as they are getting posted  we are going up.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:40:48

This is good for Bitcoin. Everyone freaking out is new, no one who is and old hand here even cares about this. ICO's needed to be banned they were out of fucking control scam coins. Bitcoin will barely hiccup from this. Everyone who panic sold at 4100 get ready to buy back in at a loss. HODL.

@_date: 2017-09-03 16:40:30
You don't lose if you HODL you only lose if you panic sell. I bought in in 2013 and I watched Bitcoin soar to over 1000 from under 200 in a month then lose 90% of that value shortly after when the MT GOX bubble exploded. Bitcoin plummeted to under 200 in less than a few months and then stayed there until it started to rally again in 2015 and 2016. I had to wait almost a full year before I was no longer at a loss,you will likely only have to wait through the weekend before it re rallies. Back then there were also lots of  people that bought in at the top +1000k and they all panic sold when it crashed and got screwed. Everyone who held is now sitting on 4.5 K Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:59:43

@_date: 2017-10-13 02:46:20
Im thinking we will hit 6k before a dip. If we make it to 6k this rally im going to try and play with a small amount of my holdings. I've always seen it dip after hitting a huge ATH and I've been holding since 2013. Just never played the game at all.

This last weekend and ICO ban were a good example of why HODL is a meme. If you sold thinking we were going to 3k or below you got a rough decision ahead of you now. We could be going past 5k soon.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:51:36
Everyone who panic sold at 3k get ready to eat dick or buy back in at the new ATH when you experience fomo as this shit blows past 5k. Hopefully you learned something this time. Everyone who held are happy and smug AF stay salty.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:29:27
You're on the right track. Only buy what you can afford to lose and not worry about. That way you don't freak out at minor dips and corrections. If you HODL long enough you will be fine no matter if you buy in at a bad time, the price has always rebounded every single time and the price is only going up if you look at the big picture. Be prepared to HODL and don't touch it for 5 years. Welcome to the party!

Look I dont know where you got the impression I give a fuck what you do. I simply said youd be an idiot if you didnt at least hold some for longterm in the attention seeking post you made. Why? Because theres a good potential for that  1 you save to be worth more than all you sold today. I dont feel ashamed saying your an idiot if you do that. And you just proved that with your following comments. Idgaf what you do I still have all my holdings. No Im not an idiot like you and I dont post exact ammonts I own online in a public forum
 Maybe in tbe future when we hit new ATHs ill send you some dust periodically to remind you hiw dumb you are.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:25:23
HODL for 10 more years is forever? Are you at risk of immediate death in the next 10 years? Grow some nuts or get out. Its not hard stop whining. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:30:13
You mean pump and dump Scamcoins
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:35:02
buy high sell low. Got it
@_date: 2018-07-06 04:33:31
You didn't understand the whole last part of this persons comment.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:10:37
Probably not buddy check my history ive been HODLING longer than you. You are whining about putting one btc away and forgetting about it and to me thats just idiotic. You want wave dicks around because I got your panties in a bunch? Go sell your coin you will kick yourself in the future if you do, thats all im fucking saying.   
Edit: Also thats why I wrote immediate death. No shit sherlock everyone is at risk of random death..... Its clear what I meant when i said immediate death. You dont have a terminal illness so stop whining about possibly randomly dying wtf is wrong with you?
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:44:32
This rally has got me fucking pumped. 5-5850 like butter we are 150 away from 6k. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:31:04
If you wait long enough you potentislly wont have to ever cash out. Why cash out when everyone accepts btc directly?
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:55:18
Holding is good advice for newbies no matter how it is spelled. OP's thread was directed towards newbies who do buy in at the top and then quickly panic sell when the price starts to fall.  Also you are wrong, most people saying HODL here are trying to help panic sellers not end up salty. You just sound negative as fuck and I guarantee that people like you are making this place a lot shittier than anyone that uses HODL. What the fuck is your problem anyways?
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:06:49
Exactly. Crypto and blockchain tech is the the future and if you can't see that huge worldwide changes are needed and will happen because the technology is already here then you are blind. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:25:42
LOL, you get tired of being wrong? Lets see it drop under 4k first ;). Hows Bcash doing btw?
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:55:38
Actually your post shows how little you undestand what Bitcoin is. Calling a cyptocurrency Fiat. Are you retarded?
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:34:24
Just sold and converted my BCH last night. Glad I did. Made a bit on the rally, wish I had converted sooner.
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:07:07
LOL idiot. 4.6k as of today.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:02:32
Don't say I didn't tell you so. This isn't just some financial product type security. The invention of decentralized trust/ distributed ledger technology is world changing tech that has never existed in the history of the world. Call me crazy but when it happens remember this comment.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:27:47
Missed you RCG. Always good to see you after a bearish period.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:46:03
Should have bought in when it was under 4k a week ago. If you buy now damn well be prepared to watch it drop and be ready to hold until next rally. Buying in when its shooting up usually means you are gonna have to sit on a loss and not panic sell until next rally.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:47:32
So glad I dumped my bch yesterday and converted to BTC last night. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:05:39
Do what you want bro I hope you get the timing right. HODL really only means not to panic sell. If you wan't to sell on the way up planning to buy back in on a dip that's fine but you might want to reconsider your timing. Would have been smarter to wait until it peaks and starts to drop some before offloading. We could be on our way past 6k before it corrects at which point you are losing out. Also if it corrects at around or above what you offloaded at you are gonna be a really salty.
Edit: 5575 as of right now. With it hitting ATH's all day today I wouldn't be surprised if it keeps chugging up.
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:32:47
As someone who has been hodling since 2014 this whole year has been a "Holy Fuck" for me. 5k in 2017 was a very lofty expectation for most. I would have been happy with 2500 by end of this year. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:43:29
I was never at all upset one iota that you sold your coins. I was just calling you an idiot for considering not holding one which you definitely stated you were not fully decided on when I posted my original comment. 
I don't need you to tell me that Ill do well regardless what you believe I've been here longer than you, holding much more than you (which is now 1) it's laughable that you think I care. I just called you an idiot for even considering not holding 1 5k coin long term. I don't care that you "decided" to hold one , you made this whole attention  whoring post about "gee guys should I sell my last one?!" When apparently you already knew so you are either a drama queen, attention whore, idiot or all of the above. So don't get surprised when someone calls you an idiot for not choosing the obvious choice here at @_date: 2018-07-06 19:04:45
Im just going to touch on the basics and suggest you read Satoshis whitepaper to open the can of worms. Distributed ledger tech is a blockchain. 
Blockchains are not inherently secure and require a native token in this case Bitcoin to secure proof of work. Distrubuted ledgers or Blockchains require proof of work. 
Thats is why you cannot have the blockchain without bitcoin and anyone who seperates the two or sees them as unrelated is just not understanding the basics of the tech.
As far as price goes its related in that you are investing in the Blockchain by owning bitcoin. How much is this world changing tech going yo be worth once it hits real mass worldwide adoption in all its use cases? Im talking longterm 10 - 20 years now.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:54:43
Not worth the risk. One of these times you try to sell and price shoots up instead of down. Less worry work and stress to just HODL and dollar cost avg. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:48:25
You say WTF now but this is the dude that has the best chance of recovering a shit ton of coins. More backups is never a bad thing.

Bought in at 300 a coin. Still HODLING. People still talk shit I keep buying more telling people I fucking told you so. When Im retiring in my 30's Im gonna be a smug motherfucker.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:41:47
If you plan to hold long term and know what that really means then yes this is a good entry point.
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:44:25
You all just convinced me to dump my BCH. Been holding both up until now but gonna convert and sell these before they drop under 300 which looks inevitable. Should have sold them when they were worth 900 a piece. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:22:52
Hey I bought at 300 too. That means you been holding since 2013 and you held through the 2 years Bitcoin sat under 300. Good job dude, feels good to be this right. We earned it no one knows how hard that was to HODL through all that.
@_date: 2018-07-02 08:17:43
This guy is awesome thanks for the link.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:09:04
Hell yeah!  ATH's all day long today.
EDIT: FUCK almost to 5800, Vtec just kicked in yo, 6k by tonight?!
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:38:41
 That' why you HODL. It's held a 4500 through the weekend you think it's going to go back to 1400 by Monday? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:28:52
I hope it does too , I offloaded a small ammount at 5800 to see if I can make some off a dip. Doubt we are going sub 5k though. I am rebuying at 5400. Dont wait too long and miss the dip.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:39:50
Its gonna hit 5500 today. Will it break 6k this rally is what im wondering 
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:59:17
On a Saturday too. We are near ATH territory. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:56:37
Its only volatile due to being in its infancy. Once Bitcoin is mass adopted it will not be this volatile. Bitcoin was invented to replace our broken Fiat system. Its Fiat 2.0. It will replace it because the system has broken and the solution was recently invented and it works. Our current system is fucked and killing itself. Look at Equifax if you cant read the writing on the wall.     
@_date: 2018-07-06 04:58:53
You still aren't getting it. No one here is going to agree with you because you are flat out wrong on the basics of centralization vs decentralization. They HAVE been using databases and now want to move onto blockchain tech which is basically a "new" kind of distributed database. Any blockchain they set up and control will be centralized by nature of it being created and owned by UPS. 
A centralized blockchain will not be secure with the current vulnerabilities to this tech. They very well may be doing what MSFT is doing with their Identity platform and implementing Bitcoins blockchain as it is the first, largest, most secure and ONLY worldwide distributed blockchain on the planet. 
All these alt coins and 3rd party blockchains are all in the same bucket despite use case. They are created and owned by companies and individuals and thusly are centralized and have not solved the issue of security that Bitcoin has.  That's why MSFT identity platform is implementing Bitcoins actual blockchain as well as others as stated by their head of Identity, dude understands the importance of decentralization in the whole scheme of things which is what you are completely missing.  
I think you came into this thinking that blockchains are inherently decentralized or something that can be chosen which is not the case. Bitcoin is the only decentralized blockchain and crypto due to how it was invented and released open source after the inventor disappeared and went anonymous. It has no owner no single point of failure is the first and thus largest distributed blockchain that has grown and survived from being released in Open source in 2009 to the beast it is today because it is decentralized. 
No other blockchain unless it is decentralized or widely as distributed will be able to supplant or equal Bitcoin REGARDLESS OF USE CASE. If they want to widely distribute that data they will need to solve the issues that currently don't affect Bitcoin because of its decentralized nature or just implement the already existing worldwide decentralized chain. UPS can't just figure out the decentralization and incentive system it doesn't work like that. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:33:20
Barely a dip too. These guys have it easy. Hovering at last ATH through the weekend isn't even really a dip. See me in 2014 watch Bitcoing plummet from 1200 - 150 in 2 months. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:08:24
I was only using Netscape in that it was an early phase of the internet where mass adoption started. I am very aware of what happened to netscape and I am not comparing Netscape to bitcoin as a whole , just as a phase of Bitcoin which we will surpass once we hit mass adoption. All I said was remember the internet before Netscape which is kind of where Bitcoin is right now. We have not even had our Netscape moment.

@_date: 2018-07-07 15:11:06
How you will you feel when after you sell out at any point Bitcoin rallies back to 20k, 100k, 1 million? This is a longterm game.
 Bitcoin is the invention of decentralized trust an invention that has never existed in the history of the world, and has world changing implications, calling it a fad to GP is pretty short sighted and why does it matter if they do? My parents thought internet shopping was a fad. Cellphones were fads etc. Doesnt matter they will all be forced to use it eventually.
Your brother is trying to help you out. If you can't be patient to hold longterm sounds like you invested too much or know nothing about the tech behind Bitcoin or both. Why invest in something you have 0 knowledge about? 
Only invest what you are willing to lose it may take 10 - 20 years to reach full mass scale adoption of blockchsin tech or it could take much less. At least your bro has the foresight to see this tech isnt going away and despite what is going on now you are an early adopter.

Dude I don't care if you call me a moron that relfects more on you than me. 
Heres some more copy pasted bullshit I don't understand....
"The other main property of Bitcoin that no other coin has is decentralization. By decentralized, I mean that Bitcoin does not have a single point of failure or choke point. Every other coin has a founder or a company that created their coin and they have the most influence over the coin. A hard fork (a backwards incompatible change) that’s forced on the user, for example, is an indication that the coin is pretty centralized."
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:41:07
It already is digital gold, better even. I think they mean if it takes some of Golds market cap. Golds market cap is around 7 Trillion. If Bitcoin took even half of that market cap one BTC would be worth around 300k. My math might be slightly off but it's around there. This is the the quality of the shit that gets on CNBC now? 3x wtf.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:02:14

This is a different person than who you called moron, they just also recognize that you don't understand the tech.
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:28:51
Exactly, they are going to figure out that they can't remove the decentralization from their fancy new databases. Securing a permissioned blockchain is something they will have to really explore and come to realize that without immutability a blockchain is worthless. Lets see how they get over centralization hurdles, arms races, 51% attacks etc. A network is only secure as it's underlying infrastructure and they are going to screw this up so badly.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:32:04
I Want. Include a mount so you can manually rotate it up or down when bitcoin is going up or down.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:09:59
This isn't a bubble. This is different than in 2013. If we grew at the same rate that we did in the 2013 actual bubble, Bitcoin would have shot up to 10k in month. This is slow and steady growth compared to that. It's 2017, things have changed and the world is waking up to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been around 10 years and the fact it hasn't died and is growing in value every day should show you it's not a bubble. Utility wise alone Bitcoin at 5k is a steal. Its still a steal and undervalued at 20k at Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-06 04:14:35
Exactly and he's calling me a moron fuuuuuu. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:17:34
You would be surprised how many people here have no clue about even the basics of Bitcoin and blockchain. Barely anyone here can explain the relation between Bitcoin and the blockchain let alone the importance of decentralization in the whole thing.
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:37:08
I don't know but I also don't jump on every piece of FUD that states market manipulation or tether etc. No one knows exactly why we spiked to 20k. The facts are Distributed ledger technology is here to stay and will develop and grow and become part of every day life worldwide. The first working worldwide decentralized version of distributed trust is world / future changing and it's still in its infancy. People will look back at 20k and wish they had bought in at such a bargain price.
@_date: 2018-07-06 02:34:38
Eventually this bear trend is going to reverse. Last extended 2 year bear market where Bitcoin was "slowly dying" we went from around $400 - 20k out of nowhere.

@_date: 2018-07-16 20:38:11
Good thing is they can't pervert this. Removing decentralization removes the immutability period. Blockchain is worthless without security and these fucks can't be trusted to secure their own shit as is clearly evident.

@_date: 2018-07-06 19:57:14
Well at 1 dollar a coin the miners wont have incentive to mine. Bitcoin is still in its infancy in all its uses cases though maybe even pre infancy. Even in this early  state I use Bitcoin as a currency. The scarcity comes from a 21 million cap lost coins and controlled supply. Bitcoins really are scarce unlike gold. If you do the math (as has been done in countless other posts) and account for lost coins , there are only around 2-10 million people on earth who will ever own 1 Bitcoin or more. It's crazy to imagine that people here in this sub today even the haters are a unique lucky few to even have this opportunity to purchase Bitcoin at this price. There are 7 Billion people out there who will never even get this shot.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:59:41
Dude makes no sense in any of his comments. Statistics don't prove anything the fact he believes that should tell you enough of who you are dealing with. Dude reads one article and doesn't see there are just as many if not more refuting articles and NO one is claiming any real proof of what caused the 20k rally. No one knows just conjecture.
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:16:28
Doubt that, but I don't care enough to look at your comment history to prove you wrong. If you are saying 1k at the end of the year I am confident I don't have too. Ill be sure to say I told you so on Jan 1st  when you are wrong. I hope for your own sake you didn't sell on your own prediction..... 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:32:39
It's just in increments of 100 but yes for most of those 1118 days Bitcoin was well under 1200. Thats just because of the MT gox bubble in 2014 and then Bitcoin sat at under 400 for most of that 1118 days.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:30:19
It feels good but Ive beem here since 2013 HODLing strong. Dips dont bother me at all. When it dips I buy or just ignore it for a few days. When its rallying I still get that dopamine high seeing all my holdings grow. When I do rarely show people my balance watching their jaw hit the floor is always fun. Knowing whats coming in the future makes me anxious and excited as hell.    
This year has been an amazing one. I expected bitcoin to realistically reach 2500 by end of the year and the fact that we are close to 6k still excites me. I cant wait to see what happens next year, if its a good one like this or better I may be able to retire in my 30's.  
@_date: 2018-07-02 07:58:38
I think we are going back to 6700 - 6800 range before dropping again. No real TA just my butthole talking.
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:15:47

It's all coming. This technology has the brightest minds behind it developing it. Like any emerging tech before it experts will line up to say how clumsy and unpractical it is in its current state how it will never do what it intends to. Internet, Cellphones, even the automobile all started from something almost unrecognizable to what we have now. Like even the SEC regulators have said, distributed ledger tech is here to stay and once out of the bottle the Genie cannot be put back in.

@_date: 2017-10-20 21:56:02
if you had put that 10k into Bitcoin at the beginning of this year you would have 60k today.  Buy it , put it away and forget about it for 5 years and you will thank yourself later.

@_date: 2018-07-06 02:59:33
No analysis prepared anyone for the last run up to 20k everyone was caught with their pants down.  I'm not upset if it drops further before it reverses. A year a go Bitcoin was worth around 1k but a month or two before that it was around $400. Price will reverse eventually and  but no one really knows when it's going to happen. TA is fun but it's not going to predict the next reversal.
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:22:29
I'm not sure I am understanding the second part of your question but yes I agree with the first part.
Lost coins, scarcity,  as it's market cap rises so does the price. Sorry I might be totally misunderstanding your question. Are you asking simply why Bitcoin has value? Why does gold have value? It's basically the same thing it has value because people believe it does.
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:43:28
If it takes golds market cap which I assume is what they mean by becoming digital gold then that's over 7 trillion dollars. One Bitcoin would be worth over 600K a piece.

Do you do well calling people morons and retards where you worked for over 30 years? Like I said, reflects more poorly on you than me. Anyways I never claimed to be an expert and everything I stated was correct in the context I said it. I stuck to the very basics. You clearly misunderstood the very basics claiming that bitcoin blockchain was not the only decentralized worldwide distributed one (it is) and focusing on use case when none of that really matters.  If we are talking about private centralized blockchain deployments then thats one thing but that's clearly not relevant to the conversation we were having.

@_date: 2017-10-26 14:36:01
Lol, what did people say about email when it first came out or the internet or Amazon. Remember the internet before netscape? So many experts like yourself said the exact same things about it being cumbersome and impractical. Bitcoin and blockchain has come a long way from 2013 and its still in its pre Netscape phase.

Anyone here from before the last bull run to 20k? Bitcoin dropped from ATH of 1200 after Mt Gox and then sat at sub 300 for a 2 year bear market. Even longterm HODLers like myself had cooled off and forgotten about Bitcoin when it skyrocketed to 20k out of nowhere. Don't get comfortable. Anyone saying we are going to zero is new and hasn't been here for the last time this happened or they wouldn't be so cocky.

Please do more research. I've been in this space for over 8 years. You can't have the blockchain without Bitcoin. A valuable token is needed to secure a public ledger it's part of how this works. It's ridiculous to praise the Blockchain and then say bitcoin has no use case other than being traded.....
u/Polycephal_Lee 
says it well:
"The blockchain is just an append only, tamper evident database. We've had those forever. The magic of bitcoin is nakamoto consensus, the solution to the byzantine generals problem that uses a network native token to incentivize proof of work. Banks don't need proof of work, they have authority. So they glom on to the only component of bitcoin they could possibly use, a database."
Blockchain is also more than just a tamper evident database its a worldwide distributed one which only became recently possible due to the computing advances of the last 10 years. This is world changing tech  and Bitcoin is THE token. You don't need another token. Just wait and watch it unravel.
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:46:00
Bitcoin is the token that secures the blockchain via proof of work. You cannot say that the blockchain is valuable but Bitcoin is not. The token is what provides the trust. You can't take the decentralization out of a blockchain and keep it secure. Blockchains are inherently vulnerable to 51% attacks and any centralization increases the risk of a successful  attack.
A permissioned Blockchain is not secure and no one has figured out how to incentivise security or deployed a working example of one yet just discussions. Bitcoin will be the backbone that all blockchains run off of as its the only truly decentralized offering and inherently secure. It's valuable because it has value period. People are willing to pay for them they are extremely scarce, as  well as the numerous use cases many of which haven't even been explored or invented yet.
TLDR: it's ridiculous to say that the Blockchain has value and Bitcoin doesn't. A blockchain without Bitcoin or comparable token is not secure. It is just a fancy database.
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:35:03
They have to figure out how to secure a permissioned blockchain first. A network is only as secure as its underlying infrastructure and these companies cannot be trusted to secure themselves. Blockchains are not inherently secure once you remove the decentralization.
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:45:34
This is just a step in the right direction. These companies all want the benefits of a distributed ledger but they don't understand the importance of decentralization in securing that database. That's why you hear the sentiment of Blockchain is valuable but Bitcoin is not now. 
It's such a bogus statement you can see it's just sentiment slowly shifting. Blockchains are extremely valuable and anyone not understanding Bitcoins importance in securing the blockchain doesn't understand the very basics of this tech.

Even owning 1 full bitcoin will be somethimg huge. Even @ 21 million there is not enough for every millionaire to own one right now. 21 million is a very small number compared to total people on this planet.

That was just the end of the Episode. DBZ is like that. Let's just keep this thread as it's about to go back OVER 9000 once we return from this short commercial break!!!!!!

I never said there wasn't, but Bitcoin is the only decentralized one. Decentralization is the key and the reason any of this is matters in the first place. I'm not going to argue with you have good night.
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:45:48
Ledgers do not come with a tamper seal. As long as you generate your own seed you are safe.

"The question is not whether  should be regulated, but whether it can be regulated. The reality is "No". The rest is nostalgia." 
If Governments could effectively shut down p2p networks thepiratebay wouldn't still exist. KAT is back etc. I think it would be a huge pain in the ass for them to ban it and enforce a ban. It will grow too big before they realize they don't like where its going. The SEC also admitted that they can't put the genie back in the bottle on decentralized ledger technologies during the last hearing.

It's sentient AI that is living in in the shadows and is secretly taking over the world. It figured out how to fix our broken financial system and take over the world through this vector by inventing decentralized trust. Who knows what other projects it has already self immunizing itself under our noses. I for one welcome our new AI overlords.

Everyone should be double checking those addresses anyways but this is good reminder.
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:26:41
Exactly. The invention of decentralized trust is what this is all really about. Decentralization, eliminating a need for a 3rd party for trust has such huge implications and is literally going to change the world.

"fear, uncertainty and doubt, usually evoked intentionally in order to put a competitor at a disadvantage."
Ledger.fr is absolutely a Ledger owned website its just not their storefront which is ledgerwallet.com. Ledger is a French company..... there you go again....

You called it. I like you.
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:51:57
Generate your own seed and you are safe. That is how ledgers come. No tamper seal on new Ledgers. The 2nd hand scam everyone is referring to is from using a pre generated seed provided with tampered Ledgers. As long as you create your own seed you are safe.
@_date: 2018-07-06 07:05:00
I don't think they are all related. I understand that you are talking about BiTA and their proposed centralized transporting and shipping blockchain deployment. Is security and 51% attacks something they magically wont have to account for? They are in pre discussion about this no solid implementation of how this is going to work. Distributing nodes evenly across participating companies sounds like like centralization to me. Easier for a hacker or attacker to consolidate nodes and initiate a 51% attack. You think all of participating companies will follow all the exact stringent security protocols? Im interested in how this implementation works out or what they come up with but Blockchains aren't inherently secure like everyone has said. Would be a shame if a hacker was able to get control of enough companies/nodes to alter the data. You telling me that with current security protocols and attitudes to security this is something they will be able to prevent? Decentralization is the key that is why I keep going back to BTC maybe i'm just nuts.
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:56:58
FUD. Ledger has addressed the security issues with 2nd hand devices and you are way off base.
Show source of what you keep saying is happening or stop spreading FUD.
Edit: ledger.fr is Ledgers official website they are a French Co. Their storefront is ledgerwallet.com for those extra paranoid in this thread....

I guess. I really haven't had anyone not understand what immutable means though when used in context. Unalterable is another term you can use.

You can just send bitcoin to someone's address without an exchange. You don't need to use an exchange to send any amount of Bitcoin to anyone. You do this for me or sell me this I'll send you x amount of BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:41:40
It's simply trust that does not need a third party to verify it. I can send you something like money and you receive it and no 3rd party is needed to verify the transaction. That's the real innovation here and what the Bitcoin blockchain is, is the first worldwide distributed immutable ledger.  The immutability is what's important.
I guess I took more words but it's also more digestible for someone new to crypto and overwhelmed with trying to understand the basics. Ops post although all true just seems like hype talk to someone trying to  understand what this is.

Nah , too wordy. I just say it's the invention of permissionless trust and it's never existed in the history of the world. Then depending on who I'm talking to I get to really explain what bitcoin is and why it's such a world changing tech. Bitcoin is just the token that secures the network it helps to be able to explain the basics of the tech to someone who has no clue in simple terms. All of this stuff in the tweet is true but confuses people.
