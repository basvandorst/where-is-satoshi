I always hover the mouse over the links of suspicious emails to see if the links correspond to what the origen could be, in this case I think is legit :  I suspect that they got my email from the hack to the bitcointalk forum as other emails that I received from a lot of ico's but I just ignore them or report as spam.

Yes, and that makes that a high percentage of people only go to vote just to not get fined ..and as expected we end up with some kind of pseudo-representatives on government that till now we ask ourselves how they got elected ..

Peruvian here :P , yep you are right those lines  normally is to pay for anything related to transactions with government agencies, old plan of retirement pension , no-voting fines, etc.
But recently there is a new law defining the use and implementation of electronic cash "Dinero Electronico" using basically a cellphone for transactions person&lt;-&gt;person , person&lt;-&gt;commerce , person&lt;-&gt;government/agencies with some monthly amount limits and will be via sms or internet, is something similar to what was implemented in Africa I think.
Obviusly the companies that will start implementing this kind of payment-processing will be the telco's (more money for them), I gave a glance to the law text and I was thinking what good oportunity could be for a payment-processor with bitcoin-network support .
