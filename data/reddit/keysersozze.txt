My son was playing with it and must have put it there - typical baby/mini-drunk.
I seem to miss catching these kind of random things - would have scratched my head if that thing was there too before he came along

Two dogs - both little bastards - very perceptive, I didn't even know that thing was bitten up

My 14 month old must have put it there - daily chaos with that kid

Without a doubt - that will come later, I was speaking more architecturally, do miners have to signal adoption or is it going to be in the latest bitcoind?
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:32:17
Great thanks for that
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:06:05
Got that covered too!

Question I can’t seem to find an easy answer to: What tangibly needs to happen for LN to be deployed across Bitcoin and what can I do as a user to help? Do I need to be a miner or can I run a full node?

This is the LaMetric Time ( pretty cool device w/ api integrations - learned about it from this MKBHD video:

Think I paid $149 for it? not for everyone I guess

Funny - got my wife some too - she's been my hodling wingwoman, great to have a partner through the journey. She would have never let me put this up otherwise :-)
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:29:52
Yup! not gonna lie :-)

There's a bunch of apps - I've seen some popular alts - ETH, LTC - not sure about others, there's an API that can easily check GDAX, CMC etc

Aesthetics - you don’t want smartphone displays hanging around your home. My teenage bedroom would have been fine but wouldn’t work for the TV room
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:30:48
ha! haven't thought of that till now.... brb gotta take a shower
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:03:34
I don't understand - what is OP saying?
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:07:16
Cringy AF - back in the old school this type of shitpost was a sell signal

Actually 6 months as we’re in a new resistance line indicating a parabolic uptrend - it will be easier for BTC to move from 10K to 20K than from $1 to $3

Don't disagree, I think it would leave viewers with either a 'wow, this is really cool - I need to look into this more' or 'hmm... TIL, thought it was for buying illegal stuff on the underground internet'.
The fact that viewers will leave with a favorable view - at best- is definitely a good thing for Bitcoin's longer term promise.

Very well said - cognizance of reality is the first step in forging your own.
