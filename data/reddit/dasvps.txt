Just because you made bad decisions doesn't mean Bitcoin Cash is shit or at fault. This is on you. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash have different methodology but they're both fine coins. Your hate is immature and pretty pathetic.

I think you misunderstand what they support... Maybe you took 1 person's opinion as the consensus of all BCH supporters. They know unlimited block sizes won't work. They know that their current model isn't sustainable forever, and a layer 2 solution will eventually become necessary. It seems like a lot of the hate people have for BCH causes them to believe that BCH supporters currently think the coin is perfect as is, and will never need to change. I don't think any BCH supporters believe that's the case.
Also, since I feel like I need to state this anytime I say something here that isn't negative about BCH... I do not support BTC over BCH or BCH over BTC. I see value and future in both coins and don't let myself get involved in the pettiness displayed by both groups of supporters.

If you want to carry your private keys with you, I can be sure to be the one that hits you. I'll be soft :)

Salty cunt is a bit over the top. Pessimistic maybe. Stop being so defensive. It's a terrible trait we seem to have here.

Say you had 2.45 BTC on August 1st, then you now have 2.45 BCH in your Blockchain account. Last I checked, the value of 1 BCH was roughly $3,400. So if you had any serious holdings in BTC, congrats on your new found wealth.

People coming up with giant conspiracy theories to explain the problems that Bitcoin is having.
