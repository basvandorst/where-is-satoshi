Spot on! Seems like everyone's Donald Trump these days.

Everybody's tilted over Bitfinex. I will tell you that regardless of your jurisdiction, your legal case against the equal loss attribution is going to be fruitless. Absolute 0.0% chance of success. You cannot attribute different losses to members of the same stakeholder group, that's not allowed. What they do is mandatory to prevent insolvency, and based on international legislation all financial institutions must treat members of the same stakeholder group equally - whether it happens in the litigation process or in the process of preventing imminent insolvency.
If you insist on a legal case, go ahead, but you will probably be told the same I just told you for free, but for a consultation fee of 500+ USD per hour. S* happens, sorry for your loss.

Thanks for posting this. It's a good reference to show that long-term legal advice and consulting is not something an average Joe could afford. "I will call my lawyers" threats are too funny, especially when coming from a tilted jackass who lost 5 Bitcoins ;)!

    There is no legal way they can then take funds from the unaffected parties without breaking the law.
No, that's the exact opposite. Anyone using their website is an "unsecured creditor". It does not matter if you were depositing your BTC or USD or both with them, you're still one of the same group. Individuals matter nothing, only the stakeholder group to which you belong is relevant.

If Bitcoin continues to be a mere HODL-currency, it will only appreciate if there's a major loss of trust in another asset-class.
In case of a next financial crisis, or a major technical enhancement, it might go as high as 5K $ per coin. Assuming we won't have a major crisis, it is going to be a boring float around 600-900$ per coin. I don't believe in a 10x appreciation due to block reward halving. Days of easy gains are over. It's now a 7-year old technology that needs to further prove itself to gain adoption. If more businesses start accepting Bitcoin payments, the masses will follow.
To win over big businesses, i see two major points of improvement - privacy and scaling. Privacy is more important of the two. In some niches, it's just not possible to do business in a transparent way. Your competitors will eat you alive.

If you put your funds (BTC, USD, ETH, ....) to an online exchange such as Bitfinex, you by definition are "Unsecured Creditor". All unsecured creditors take the first hit in case of an imminent risk of insolvency. All unsecured creditors are to take equal losses. You cannot attribute different losses to members of the same stakeholder group, that's not allowed by international legislation.
If anyone wants to sue so bad, trying from another angle may produce a different outcome: bad commercial practices. And that for misleading people into thinking the funds stored at Bitfinex were secured and covered by insurance. This at most will get Bitfinex fined, and maybe they will even lose the license to operate. But is there any chance of making a financial profit out it? That's right, in the end, there's nothing but the "Got you now fkers!... and empty pockets".
