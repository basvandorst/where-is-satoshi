If they just wanted a quick fix, they could just match Bcash. No, they are taking their time for good reason. Bcash screams about "Satashi's vision" but fails in the most fundamental part, decentralisation.

If i am completely honest... probably 20% ideology... 20% tech... 60% to try and make money.
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:20:05
Of course.... completely not the point. Warren Buffet likely knows more about economics than anyone in bitcoin. It doesn't mean no one in bitcoin knows about economics... likewise, just because Buffet steers clear of things he doesnt understand, he 100% understands economics.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:11:23
You attribute all of that to futures... I'm suggesting that is ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:22:24
Very good post and fits my thinking too, not a chance that the futures market is solely responsible for the recent dips. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:03:53
They realise it's global, right?

I think both of those will be fine. Bitcoin + LN + media coverage and trust makes me think btc will survive.

Mentally stable?! Fuck you... what a low cunt.
I've been in this game since 2013... i understand manipulation... i just know that the futures market is tiny and in no way affecting this dip in the manner you suggest.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:55:14
I think it was physiological selling.... like most every other case of fud. We'll never know though... but as laid out in this post, the small futures sums just don't seem too add up.
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:50:26
If that's the case, then using bitcoin's name in bitcoin cash is cultural appropriation!
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:01:01
This is my hope. Bitcoin are doing things slow and steady so that they have a scalable, cheap, fast and.. most importantly.. decentralised solution that can really try to establish itself in the real world. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:05:52
I think there is more to it.... I think the banks and financial giants are using the futures market to suppress the price, pushing lots of people to swap their btc for alts. They are buying up all the btc they can, knowing that it will be one of the few that will pass the test of time.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:00:11
Not sure your point... If you are happy with centralisation, why do you even care about bitcoin? If you are interested in decentralisation, you will understand that it is still early days in terms of scalability... yet, currently, you can move money for less than $14 and it will take under 30 mins at high priority 
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:02:19
So you understand everything you invest in? Do you know what economics is?

Dimon gets massively overcredited for the crash to $3k. That was after the China news broke. He just kicked it when it was already down.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:27:56
If you completely ignore decentralisation... i guess they're right.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:59:19
I've seen nothing at all in today's movements to suggest any real manipulation... some people are giving far, far too much perceived power to the very small btc futures market (where there is a winner and loser, btw).
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:52:04
No one really knows yet how these fast and cheap/free transaction coins will work with scale. Btc is having to deal with scale in real-time, so we get to see the current negatives and, hopefully, the coming positives.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:22:37
Not everything goes on news... The market tested the $10k point and it showed strong resistance for the second time in a week... This might be seen as a good sign by investors who then started buying. Likewise, if it had gone from $10k to $9k, the opposite would have probably happened.
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:51:02

I've been into btc since 2013, yet have traded quite a bit of my btc across to alts for one reason.... fees.
Once segwit and/or LN go mainstream... I'll be back.... but let's not bury our heads.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:06:31
Bitcoin is decentralised, bitcoin is fully tested against attacks over 9 years, bitcoin is open source, the core team are passionate and the whole project is about longevity and scaling, not quick fixes to keep the price rising.
I currently only hold about 6% btc, so I'm hardly evangelical.... But these free/fast transaction coins are not the holy grail that some seem to think. They are mostly centralised and have yet to prove anything in terms of scaling, network spamming etc. It is very easy to be fast and cheap when you have very few transactions and are centralised.
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:36:01
Very good news... all major exchanges will launch ICX once they move from eth to mainnet
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:48:27
All part of the game, I'm afraid.
Also, i think his words didn't have that much effect... it was the China news that was big... dimon just kicked it while out was already down
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:36:30
Does he need money?
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:42:52
Resign?! His words helped his shareholders (and me) grab btc for $3k! He deserves a raise
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:01:58
I think (maybe hope) that people are giving too much influence to these future traders. We were still in the thick of the Korean news, last time around.
This reminds me of everyone saying Dimon crashed Bitcoin, even though we were deep into the news from china. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:32:46
So the dev team should drop everything to protect your investment?
The way I see it is the bitcoin team are trying to do things right, not do things quick. Higher block size = less decentralisation

You will find that most of the top 20 will rise, fall and steady alongside btc. It's the lower coins that seem to have their own ecosystem. I have btc, monero and neo as my "safe" bets... then $SUB, $IOTA and $ICX as my wildcards (based on nice tech)... I've actually seen a rise in my portfolio this last week or so due to sub and icx rising well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:27:38

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:42:19
I didn't say that... i said that the prefix 'bitcoin' should not be allowed on forked coins (exchanges, news outlets, the community would need to enforce this). It is confusing new users.
Allowed is maybe not the best word... it should not be accepted.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:51:31
Ok... let me rephrase and say that bcash is currently running better as a currency due to tx fees and speed. Loads of alts do this better than btc too. The bcash politics, fud and outright plagiarism is it's key weakness though
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:02:36
I think it's bad for bitcoin..... adds to confusion, adds to the politics (see bitcoin cash). Forks should not be allowed the prefix of bitcoin. They are just alts.
@_date: 2018-09-30 13:10:36
Well known, first "to market', more decentralised, more and better devs, less bad press, no clear leader/s, less infighting (as of now). 
I have no issue with BCH as a currency, it's a good short/mid term fix to a problem that will have comprises (scaling). The stuff that surrounds it.. the huge involvement of bitmain and the actions of a certain few powerful players makes it harder to like.

Bitcoin cash itself isn't a scam.... It's not anything special, but it isn't a scam. The way Roger Ver promotes it as the "real bitcoin" and calls bitcoin as bitcoin core, while crying about people saying bcash.

@_date: 2018-02-21 16:48:38
It is a dirty grey area between government and financial powers. But bitcoin specifically targets financial powers, there is spill over to how it will affect government, of course (especially blockchain). 
And if it was an all out attack on government, that would be more anarchistic than libertarian (who accept some governance is required).
As said before though, it's all semantics and a bit boring. I think we can both agree that bitcoin, blockchain etc is a movement that is more than just outright capitalism. It is about personal ownership, about shifting power, about closing down corruption. You can put those ideals into various different politics systems.

but... did you also delete all your news apps, your tv etc?
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:31:41
The thing is... there is so little to be gained from talking about it at length. It's a capitalist market and this can and will happen, time and again. At least, with blockchain, we get to know it has happened. Which other financial systems would show, with complete accuracy, this kind of trade... it's impressive.

Yes, I know that particular offshoot... Just like anarchy is also an offshoot of libertarianism, which in turn is an offshoot of humanism. Search Libertarian socialism or anarcho socialism.... 
It's all a bit pedantic and boring though... If you think bitcoin is purely capitalist, I personally think you are wrong. I'd be involved in crypto if there were no gains to be made. It's about taking away central control (government and banking) which fits into libertarian thinking AND anti capitalist thinking. Not everything has to fit into neat little boxes.

thanks, didn't even know about byteball! time to trade it all for ICX

No one knows if it will dump. Anyone who actually does have some insider knowledge is not posting it on reddit!
If you have researched bitcoin and feel it has a future above $8k or so... buy now... If you are unsure, hold tight and see if it drops. 
Make sure you know about things like wallets, keys etc 
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:08:13
No one knows... 
My personal advice is to invest in bitcoin and alts you like and don't worry about making the biggest profit. Just re-balance your portfolio, from time to time. Trying to time the market is the easiest way to lose your money.
@_date: 2018-04-29 07:22:55
The article is from last week.... seems to be a growing trend on reddit... bots posting old news
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:03:30
Ver directly linked bitcoin's fees to the death of babies... is that not relevant?
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:00:25
This sounds super legit
@_date: 2018-04-30 10:02:53
Thanks for this two month old news... Come on reddit, let's sort this crap out
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:58:07
Most alts have been on a bullrun for 2 weeks, a bigger run the btc. Only today has that eased off.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:40:06
Why post something from 3 months ago?
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:27:03
Regardless of your take on what the real bitcoin is... Anyone supporting this confusion tactic is against crypto as a whole. It's fraud and it's that simple. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:15:59
Ok... you clearly don't know what you are talking about... so let's leave it there
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:06:26
Thanks for keep us up to date on last week's price movement... Not many people here bother to check the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:13:56
Just admit that you made a dumb point about btc being the only decentralised coin and move on. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:40:47

You're about as relevant as a floppy disc 
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:33:57
My thinking is that unless there was a total global ban, then the countries that allow it would put themselves in a better position than those that do ban it. World power is won and lost on being able to adjust to new technologies, especially financial technologies. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:29:08
At a huge crypto conference... yea, they do. Not sure what your issue is here... if other people want to discuss it... then it's relevant. Simple as that.
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:41:23
This is 3 weeks old, ffs
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:31:51
Week old news with "according to Bank of America Corp." In the first sentence.
Great post!
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:12:47
Whales and financial establishments might relish in the idea of $4500 coins and fleecing everyone on the way down... The lambomoons who think they are hotshots for making 0.001btc on the last drop... less so. If the bear market gets really bad, don't expect fast recoveries for years. Unless you are cashing out to fiat from these bear runs, you are running the risk of gaining btc but ruining btc too.
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:32:05
No probs... hope you get some luck in the market. Ps - i use mycellium wallet, very safe and secure... just take the time to learn about private keys and backing up your passwords etc
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:23:50
Every price prediction, every single one, is just someone trying to move the market in one direction or the other.
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:12:59
Genius!... no one's ever made that link before
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:28:55
Where is the betamax? the 3D tv? Tesla's wireless electricity?
For every hit, there are 1000 misses... Obviously i'm keen on crypto too, but these things are so misleading.
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:37:59
How many wallets are empty, abandoned? I could sit and create a million empty wallets and skew the stats even more
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:58:54
I think the golden rule for any blog post about crypto is to check the date before sharing... things get out of date really quickly! If it's over an hour old... it's been posted and could already be dated
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:47:18
Considering he is an "expert", he has a very strange way of speaking complete and utter nonsense!
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:31:06
As safe as any online company. They are the biggest fish in crypto though, so you should be covered
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:34:41
Then you try and win that battle away from the buying customer, especially the newcomer. 
This is fraud by misconception. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:58:08
So many wolf of wall street wannabes here... Anyone wanting $4500 has zero fucking clue about how fragile this market is.

@_date: 2018-04-23 11:11:41
Because we are having an alt run. This often happens when bitcoin has some sideways or small gain movement for a long period. Alot of alts got hit much harder than btc during the crash, so this is how the market tends to correct.
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:50:41
Thankfully, most of my friends who knew I had some btc asked me to form a buying syndicate for them and are now part of the hodl culture (3 year "lock" on the syndicate).
There are certainly a few people who seem to be willing it to fail though, especially the more tech involved guys I know who didn't get onboard. Very strange mentality really... If my friend's house price rises or something... I'd only ever be happy for them.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:35:19
I just sold all my bitcoin and bought kin... is that seriously what you expect?
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:35:49
Good old Wodger, he'll keep trying this little trick
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:31:38
Part of the problem is the wallets and exchanges set their defaults ridiculously high... Though that doesn't explain the sudden rise. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:34:48
Why not make an alternative suggestion then? I find coinbase absolutely fine for a quick bitcoin purchase that gets moved to a wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:29:32
People mentioning taxes, please remember not everyone is in America, getting charged tax per trade.
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:59:11
I find this sudden surge in posting old, generally negative news very suspicious. It is becoming quite regular now
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:02:44
Not really...overall I actually agree with your point that alt runs take dumb money from bitcoin to shitcoins in pursuit of quick profit. Yet your misinformation, aggressive nature and inability to debate completely negates any decent point that you make.
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:28:34
Probably the best place to buy, as a newcomer, is coinbase.com .... it is wise to learn about how bitcoin wallets work and how to keep your funds safe
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:06:33
You spelt lambo wrong
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:56:04
If only bitcoin is truly decentralised... please explain burst. PoC is more decentralised. Same for asic resistant coins.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:59:36
Roddgger has put another $1k into the bcash machine
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:19:17
Either way... surely a direct attack on bitcoin is, by definition, relevant to bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:58:54
So, you can't answer a simple question and resort to name calling.... interesting
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:24:47
Thank god for these blog posts, none of us here on reddit ever check the prices!
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:07:26
This is 7 months old.... That's 70 years old in crypto years
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:37:57
If you learn about wallets and keys, then it is very, very hard for someone to steal your bitcoin. It sounds complex at first, but is simple once you get it. If you are only investing £50 here and there, you could just keep your bitcoin on coinbase. It is slightly less secure, but very simple.
