You don’t think it will dip even further and stagnate for a little?

Even bitcoin is “fictitious”. Same principles behind that and fiat currency. Something is only worth something as long as people buy into it or say that it is. 
I’m not hating on bitcoin lol dont downvote me.  
I’m just saying like if EVERY person who wanted/ owned bitcoin said I’m only paying $1 for it, it would be worth that in a sense. 
Things are only valued at what people are willing to accept/ buy into. You know what I mean?

Oh okay, I was confused about the address and “personal information” and stuff. If you don’t mind could you explain that? I’d love to learn more. I bought .25 at 8,100 and just plan to hold for a long while but I feel I need to be way more informed. I use coinbase btw just because of the ease and just beginning and such

Why is that?  Just curious, haven’t been big into crypto’s but recently I have been after making a killing is the stock market lol, this run up was phenomenal for me but what don’t you like about PayPal? I’ve used it to withdraw from coinbase before a while back. 
Just tryna learn! Thank you!

They can??????? I honestly did not know that.... what would a better alternative be in your opinion?  I know PayPal is held in a high regard by the general public for the ease of making transactions from peer to peer and with their apps like Venmo....
