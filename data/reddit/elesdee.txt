I'm trying so hard to understand futures trading. So this person purchased a a buy order saying that on x date he will purchase x amount of bitcoin at x prices. So I understand it from the buyer and seller perspective but im having trouble understanding the speculator perspective. He agreed to buy at $15239. The price didn't hit that so on X date he will have a margin call of the difference between the amount he purchased @ $15239 and the actual price?

Have you checked to see if your bank is holding it? I've had to call my bank before and approve transactions, especially when sending money to a new institution overseas.

What am I looking at though?
So in the middle is where a buy is matched up with a sell and thus cleared as a matched order? And the escalating lines to either side are buys are those prices that will slowly work their way to the middle? Do I have that right?

Good point!
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:55:11
That's dumb, give me my $200 and I'll invest it in bitcoin. Letting someone get away with damaging your property is asinine.

The second it drops below 10k people are dumping money into it. We wont see 7k again.

Quick question, is electrum a "wallet I control the keys for"? I downloaded it and figured out how to send, store seeds and wallets and reinstate.  Do I need to keep my coins in the cold storage on electrum to be safe when the fork hits?
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:28:12
What do you mean "own your private keys" ?

I have my bitcoin in coinbase. Is it OK to let it sit there?

The hep C he contracted is rotting his brain.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:48:35
I too have this question. Is my Bitcoin safe on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:29:16
Would a paper wallet be preferable?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:57:57
I think, and someone correct me if I am wrong, that when the fork happens. Bitcoin will split into two currencies and you should have your bitcoin in a wallet you own the public and private keys too. Why? Because if you have your bitcoins in an exchange like coinbase, coinbase could decide your bitcoins are now the new bitcoins which may or may not tank.  That is my understanding, but im pretty dumb so idk
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:25:04
I think depending on the exchange, they will take you $20 and call it either new bitcoin or old bitcoin.  1 or the other
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:23:01
Is something like electrum sufficient enough for cold storage until the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:00:25
Ok, what is the best course of action then?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:16:52
Thank you!
