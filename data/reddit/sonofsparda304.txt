Agreed. Crypto isn't meant to be centralized onto exchanges. The ideal future is that business and private transactions would be done only with crypto, not with switching to USD/cashing out. We're far away from that right now, but the tech is doing a lot more than just being a currency in some cases. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:35:08
This makes a lot of sense. Moving that large (or larger) amounts of any kind in USD one way or another is going to gather attention.

I get the idea that op loses money for a reason.
I've never had a problem with coinbase. I had to contact support when I was having trouble getting registered. They responded after it had magically gone through.
Considering they have a 10k/day withdrawal limit there is probably an issue doing higher amounts that holds things up. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:29:18
Issues seem to scale with money, which makes sense. 
Coinbase isn't a bank. In the eyes of the feds, a person trading a digital asset for tens of thousands all at once looks shifty. Not saying it is, just saying how it gets seen by the authorities. 
Hopefully as time goes on the law will catch up with simplifying this. Government moves slow though, so I won't expect this to be properly handled regularly for at least a few more years. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:59:31
It's definitely applicable to miners though.

Yeah the IRS doesn't fuck around. I remember a personal finance post about a guy who got his inheritance or something and wasn't sure if he was supposed to deposit it all at once or something. The answer was basically don't hide it and be honest. Increments look sketchy, the whole payment is justifiable. You can't avoid the taxes unless you're a billionaire who shits super-yachts.

I would advise mining other currencies and then converting them to Bitcoin.
Depends on your hardware.
XMR - multicore CPUs 2MB cache per thread, some AMD and Nvidia cards
ETH - ddr5 Nvidia cards &gt;=3GB, AMD 290x/570/580 and a few others
ZEC - Nvidia

How difficult is the concept that the dollar isn't the be all end all currency? Even if you think of Bitcoin as fiat, you can't deny that Bitcoin has more buying power than a dollar or any other world currency. Not to mention it's relative value and buying power constantly increasing. 
What you think is a difficult concept for other people is really just your own ignorance.
