Can they trace it even though you do for example 200 anonymity sets?

Yes they can be traced but it would be extremely hard to do so. 
Also “taint” is natural thing for all currencies. There is higher percentage of “tainted” currency distributed among people the longer the currency exists. Look into your wallet, there is a chance one of your bills is tainted. 
Coinjoin only spreads the “taint” evenly so you end up with Bitcoin which is like 98% clean. Would you not accept this Bitcoin? It wouldn’t be good for business.

True but you can still spend that beautiful green...

That’s crazy. I want some.

Cool. Did you release any other projects? I am more of a EDM/Pop guy.

Has anyone got an experience with this wallet and has anyone  checked their code on GitHub?

What genre do you produce?

I guess your best bet is to send your Bitcoin to Wasabi wallet, use Coinjoin until safety profile of your coins is at 100 and then cash them out at local Bitcoin ATM. You will encounter high fees but it will be anonymous. (I am not sure if they require ID at the ATM so someone correct me if I am wrong)

Coinjoin in Wasabi wallet. The best and the cheapest option. Fees are very minimal.
