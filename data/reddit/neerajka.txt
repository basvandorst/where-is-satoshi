Coin Center has analyzed this bill and identifies its problems here: 
Here is a quick summary of what we have done to respond to the bill since its language was announced earlier this week:

Neeraj from Coin Center here. With the help of many in the technical community we have created [this document]( It is meant to help the media understand any claims that a certain person is Satoshi Nakamoto. If you have anything to add please let us know.

I am the comms guy here at Coin Center. Don't worry.. they (and others) know about it!

Coin Center is aware of this and is working to oppose it. However it's worth noting that the bill would not change the current treatment of cryptocurrency, and is actually just redundant with existing guidance. 
"The first thing the bill would do is add "issuer, redeemer, or cashier of ... digital currency ... or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency" to the BSA’s definition of "financial institution," thus bringing these under BSA coverage. However, FinCEN’s intervening 2013 guidance made clear that these persons are already considered MSBs, and thus "financial institutions," making this section of S. 1241 bill redundant with current law. Furthermore, if this language were to remain in S. 1241 it would introduce a lot of confusion by creating new language and categorizations that would now be incompatible with FinCEN's guidance, administrative rulings, and the years of compliance efforts that have emerged around that guidance."

Neeraj from [Coin Center]( here. 
This will likely be the case in almost every state. If you are exchanging as a business (not just a one-off sale as an individual) you’re a money transmitter.
For more information on what that entails, see our [backgrounder on money transmission licensing](

Coin Center's research director laid out what Bitcoin could mean for Net Neutrality in this op-ed for Wired. It is a few months old but may answer add some color to your thinking on this subject.

Hi all, Neeraj from [Coin Center]( here. We just today published a backgrounder on OFAC which may clear up some of the questions raised in these comments. 
Read: [**What is OFAC and how does it apply to Bitcoin?**](
This should give you an idea of what the OFAC compliance landscape for cryptocurrency businesses looks like. If you have any other questions let me know.

We are! [Coin Center]( is an independent non-profit in DC that is working to build a better understanding of Bitcoin and to promote a regulatory climate that preserves the freedom to innovate using blockchain technologies. 
We regularly meet with lawmakers across the country to go over everything from Bitcoin basics to the implications of proposed rules on innovation in the space - and the importance of preserving that innovation. 
We also produce quite a bit of original policy research. Just as an example, yesterday we [released a report]( in which we argue that Bitcoin should not be classified as a security by the SEC. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 13:24:20
At [Coin Center]( we are working to develop and advocate for sound public policy related to digital currencies like Bitcoin. 
Our regularly published [backgrounders]( are designed to explain key cryptocurrency concepts in plain language. A few of my favorites: 
* [Is Bitcoin Regulated?](
* [What is Bitcoin Mining, and Why is it Necessary?](
* [How Anonymous is Bitcoin?](
* [What is Money Transmission and Why Does it Matter?](
* [What is OFAC and how does it apply to Bitcoin?](
* [Does 18 U.S.C. § 1960 create felony liability for bitcoin businesses?]( 
Another useful guide is [Bitcoin: A Primer for Policymakers]( 
Finally, our [State Digital Currency Regulation Tracker]( tracks and compares digital currency legislation state by state. 
I hope this is helpful. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!

Not exactly what you asked for but I am going to chime in anyway. 
Coin Center is leading on Bitcoin's policy, regulatory, and legal issues. We can help you get up to speed on those angles if you are interested. Drop us a line: media 
We also have a series of [backgrounders]( written by experts from all over the industry. They attempt to explain Bitcoin concepts in plain language. Some of the journalists we work with have found them helpful. Hopefully you will too.

Neeraj from Coin Center here. 
We made these pocket white papers for fun. Folks seem to like them so we started to give them away to our donors and occasionally at conferences. I promise we are not trying to indoctrinate anyone into any cults. It's more of a tongue-in-cheek take on the pocket Constitutions that are so popular here in DC. 
By the way if you want one they are available to donors [here]( You get a sweet shirt too.
EDIT: Wow, we got a rush of donations after this post. Thanks everyone!

I work for Coin Center which is leading the charge on the Bitcoin advocacy front. For example: our Executive Director, Jerry Brito, [just testified today]( before the California State Assembly's Banking &amp; Finance Committee. 
We are working to protect the freedom to innovate using blockchain technology and ensuring that any regulatory reaction to Bitcoin is based on a sound understanding of the technology. 
We are non-profit 501c4. If your current circumstance allows you to donate to us we would certainly appreciate it. Our [about]( page has some introductory information about who we are and what we do. Let me know if you would like to learn more. 
I should also mention that supporting us [includes some donor benefits]( for you as well.
