Maybe as another plugin.  They like to do that.  Especially now that they're moving to a more web-based model.

I use Armory.  The "offline" computer is actually a dual-booted Ubuntu on an encrypted partition of the hard drive, on the same laptop my "online" wallet rests on.  I've disabled wireless in Ubuntu.
If I want to sign a transaction from my "offline" wallet, Armory lets me save it to USB.  I just reboot into Ubuntu, sign the transaction, and reboot back into Windows.  Since Ubuntu is "offline" when it's active, and on an encrypted ext3 partition (invisible in Windows)... It's an amazing offline solution.  Of course, the process in Armory really makes this all user friendly, as well.

I think it does... As long as it's encrypted.  Also, I still keep a paper backup in the safe, just in case something catastrophic happens to the laptop.

Absolutely not... lol.... I'd love to really sit down and talk with you on this.  And... I did read the last part of your forst comment.  I was, honestly, really worried about it coming across as 


I'm just really excited to get this going.

When you consider that Linden Dollars were tradable for real currency, and exchange rates were being compared across global sites... I'd say the Linden was a good start towards Bitcoin.

Of course, I would like to see more places flat-out accept Bitcoin... but, this is a way to provide transaction volume, support a company that supports the Bitcoin community (x3 Gyft rewards when bought via Bitcoin), and get more use out of your BTC (in America, for now, obviously).
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:44:22
I bought several coins at $180.  Now, that I'm seeing HUGE returns, I have NO problem spending my "gains" (conversion-wise) on Gyft cards, especially since they've been so "pro-Bitcoin".  I'm basically spending $10 in investment on $50 Gyft cards.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:20:19
lol, probably.  Since I bought several coins at that rate, I've been burning up this gyft app... Paid for an Rx last night at CVS, even.  I just look at it as putting these "extra earnings" to good, practical use.
Plus, an ROI that involves cheap baby formula has finally gotten my wife on the bandwagon.  =)
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:59:29
Definitely!  I feel like I've gained sooo much "homework" while jumping into cryptocurrencies.  But, it's fun and interesting, to say the least.  =)
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:56:57
That's the thing, though... I'm not flagged "High Risk"... they just changed the amount of BTC for the price I originally paid. I **still** had to buy more, to complete a purchase, this morning.  It went through, instantly.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:24:59
Personally, I've done my homework, too... and I can't wait to link my (several) TerraMiner IV's to your pool once they come in.  I love your payout scheme, the stand your taking with the patch, and your involvement in discussions.  
Besides, let folks go to Ghash and BTC.  They'll pay fees AND have less of "a cut of the pie" when they're mining with pools that big.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:20:39
Is that why the prices bounced right back up?  those candlesticks shrank as fast as they grew.  It was pretty funny to watch unfold.  
Although... it could've been some folks trying to dump some stolen coinage.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:00:24
LOL... thanks... just took a look at the charts while writing SQL queries at work... 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:00:57
Yes... but BTC is still being spent.  It still creates a transaction.  And yes.. Gyft **is** the benefactor in this.  Which, other companies will start seeing, and go.. "Hmm... maybe there is something to this whole Bitcoin thing.  The BTC crowd is pretty loyal..."
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:28:42
In a way, yes....
You're treating it as a commodity instead of a currency.
If we hoard it all instead of spending it, how will anyone take it seriously?  That makes us no better than the "Buy gold!"-crowd.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:41:00
So, how exactly does that work?  I mean, they drop a bunch of coins... And all of a sudden, everyone's "ask" drops in relation?  Is that a function of the exchange?  I honestly don't know, and would like a few more details... I just come off sounding like an asshat in my typing, sometimes.
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:06:40
My mom, once I showed her a few of the "bitcoin.org" YouTube videos, gets it.  She couldn't wait to set up her wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:22:40
Maybe you should go back and read the post from the guy who spent 10,000 or some odd BTC on a pizza.  He's not really upset about it.  More so glad that it's gaining traction.  But... to each his own.
I'm still enjoying my part in the "decentralized Ponzi scheme"

Armory and offline wallets.  
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:52:12
In fact... Buy **as much durable goods** from these companies with "tainted coin"...
We've seen the ACA rollout... We KNOW technology is not "the government's thing"...  All it takes is a few quick, early moves from the community, as a whole, and the whole idea becomes pointless.  Especially when retailers are eating costs.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:25:10
Why does that matter?  If you spend them with any major retailer, for now (Gyft, Target, etc...)  They're probably turning right around and cashing out, because of the market.  
Unless you paid a private company and/or person in BTC, they may "keep" them.  However, I'd like for *them* to spend the BTC, too.
The currency needs to spread, to become "adopted".  Plus, If I can use my "profits" for discounts, now... I'm trying to spend BTC any way possible.  I don't care *who* gets them or what they do with them.   =)
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:27:03
Well, you can get an Asus eeePC for $120-$250... And that's IF you want to buy a new computer for this.  Hell, you can grab a used box off of eBay for $25 these days with a Pentium Dual core in it.  Maybe this would stimulate the "old computer" market.  
Heck, one of the guys I work with goes and hits the "Recycle your electronics"-bins every few months when they stick it outside our office building.  I'm sure 80% of the "crap" he pulls out of there would run an offline wallet.

NASDAQ, DOW, and S&amp;P all dropped, as well... Must be "market news"
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:09:46
Yes... you summed it up, beautifully... 
That's EXACTLY what I meant... WORD FOR WORD... how profound.
Obviously, there are other ways of support... (Like douchey-doucher-son threw back at me, above)... but this is a way to immediately provide transactions and business through a company via Bitcoin.  And, you can use your coin at more places.
God forbid someone or some company try and push this protocol forward into the market place... because your activism is really getting those Coinkite terminals out there, huh?
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:13:54
YES... I'm glad you agree that coins need to be used for this to take off.  I'm sorry, if, in my excitement, I didn't throw in "*in America, only"....  
But yes... coins need to be spent, not "sat on".  Then, we're just growing a commodity.. not a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:34:38
And, while we're on the topic of "widespread adoption"... I bet most of the folks on Reddit aren't old enough to remember the "Beginning of Credit Cards".  And I'm not talking about the "slide to copy the card", hand-held device.
When Credit Cards *first* came out, most businesses were looking at them like, "You're telling me... that a customer is going to give me a piece of plastic... and I'm going to take his word that he's good for whatever he purchases?"
On top of that.. to **accept** a credit card... It wasn't even the device I mentioned, earlier.  No... **Every week, the credit card companies would send out a BOOK of "valid numbers" to businesses who participated in accepting them.**  This book would list ALL of the numbers, numerically, and the person's **personal information** to verify that "This # = The right person".  Can you imagine that, today, from a security aspect?  Sending out a book of credit card numbers and PII every week?  TO EVERY BUSINESS THAT PARTICIPATES?
On top of that... it was usually a week or longer before the business ever saw the payment from the Card Company.  They had to just "trust" this new system would work.
Yeah... there were a lot of folks who said, "Those cards will never catch on."
EDIT: spelling

Armory allows you to 0-out if you want to.  Plus, the whole "offline wallet" feature is very nice, once you get used to it, IMO.

What's wrong with paying $99 for a licensed copy if folks are so worried about security?

It cracks me up, everytime I see someone running a "free / hacked / reg'd" version of Windows, and then freak out when it gets malware or worse.
There is a reason you don't download non-opensource OS's from the internet.  
I learned this back in 2003-4, with a "hacked" Windows XP that we shared around a few friends.  However, we all wound up with erratic bank statements, stolen passwords, etc...
I've been using Linux at home, ever since.  No problems.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:19:16
BTW... I absolutely found it hilarious.  Grabbed a few on cheaper prices... But, it was nice to see that this time, most of the folks went, "Yeah... OK... suuuure."
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:15:10
True... but, since I bought my coins at $180, and they're now worth between $588 - $610... I don't even want to do the math on how *little* I actually spent on my $50 Gyft card.
EDIT:  Yes, I do... I paid .101 BTC for that $50 card.  SInce I *originally* paid $180 for my coin, and now, it is to (for argument's sake) $588, that means I, technically, spent $15 on a $50 Gyft card.   =)
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:17:17
It took me about a week (or about 5 business days) for my first transaction.  I was nervous and a little sceptical, too.  But, now that I'm "fully verified", and I've hit my "30 day period", its just as easy and "instant" as PayPal on my checking account.  I'm impressed.
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:15:28
GI e the state of things here in America, with new legislation that will, soon, drive our deficit through the roof, I look at my BTC investments as a "hedge" against a soon deflating fiat currency.
In 10 minutes, every ten minutes, there are 6 blocks created... representing 25 BTC for each block.  Period.  That is how the code is designed.
In that same 10 minutes, our Federal Reserve just printed 7 million dollars (at least).
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:47:21
Awesome... Once you send coin through the tumblers, send a few Satoshis back to the "clean" addresses... Like the guy above said, since there is no "rejection" in the protocol, you've instantly tainted a whitelist.  
In fact, I say a boycott is almost the opposite of "what to do", then.  Find the companies that sign on with such ludicrous ideas, and "flood" them with vast amounts of "tainted coin".  When they, themselves, become "suspect", all of a sudden, this extra layer of bureaucracy and regulation becomes a real hassle.
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:24:07
Another thing that folks are failing to mention... but becoming more and more obvious... is the loyalty of the Bitcoin crowd.  Look at Gyft.  Upon announcing that they would accept BTC for their cards, their business saw an immediate draw of funds.  In the business world, being the first to cater to a "new demographic" (even if it is a small demographic, at the time) can be an amazing advantage in the long run.
