So Jamie "richer than you" Dimon who called JP Morgan's London Whale a tempest in the teapot right as the London Whale made JP Morgan a teapot in its tempest, thinks that will be the end of it for bitcoin?    
Well that's a good contrarian indicator if u need one

@_date: 2014-01-12 15:04:51
that might be so
most of the places accepting keep it in btc form i believe (though future ones may use the local gocoin)
there are times where btc floats at a premium above international rate locally too, less often now though i think
(i think after ASICs were shipped for local supply, and people bringing in their own coins)

 In the tropical idyll of Bali, dozens of merchants now accept payment in this electronic exchange system
arlier this month, a friend called Mats, who works in banking in Switzerland, set off on a long holiday in Bali for a spell of relaxation between jobs. Hoping to forget about finance for a while, he duly booked himself into a modest hotel in Ubud, a far-flung resort famous for yoga retreats.
But when he arrived in his tropical idyll he got a shock: the seemingly otherworldly location is in the midst of a striking monetary experiment. Over the past year, dozens of local merchants in this part of Bali have started accepting payment in Bitcoin, the electronic exchange system that is sometimes dubbed a cryptocurrency. Such is the enthusiasm for this financial innovation that Ubud was even staging a so-called Bitcoin festival, pulling people in from all over the world.

     GST Treatment
"The sale (including the exchange) of bitcoins in return for a consideration in money or in kind is a taxable supply of &gt;services subject to GST. If the seller is a GST-registered person, he would have to account for output tax on the sale of bitcoins made in the course or furtherance of his business. "

The opening text:
Via JPMorgan CIO Michael Cembalest,
After digesting all the hyperbole and the pessimism, my biggest concern is not that Bitcoin will fail, but that it or one of its many virtual currency competitors will one day succeed.

@_date: 2014-01-13 07:12:03
Vouch for this  
I've just finished watching the whole program
How I see it  
Its the China government trying to cool off the gamblers and speculators in China from btc (as well as distance themselves from the fallout):  
1) Gamer sinks $10k USD into BTC (selling even his prized game account) (buying pretty much at the top and selling at the bottom) --&gt; Parents don't let your kids run wild with money this way (not so different from, don't spend $10,000 on Candy Crush on your phone)  
2) OKcoin interview --&gt; you are speculating too hard, this won't end well, or we will come down hard again, ban ban ban  
3) Taobao cosmetic seller becomes ASIC miner reseller, almost gets wiped out in a month --&gt; from selling cosmetics to change completely into selling mining hardware, which part of this is a good idea? (probably saying, sell normal stuff on taobao which you actually know, stop this mining hardware flipping and speculation: if the frenzy is this rampant this would really explain why taobao did their ban/ordered to do their ban)  
4) Students who borrow money to gamble on bitcoin, unable to pay back, or have hospital bills to pay, gambled entire family's life savings. some MLM cloud hashing scheme that suckered people in --&gt; Don't gamble  
5) back to gamer --&gt; don't spend $10,000 on candy crush, spend what you can stomach, don't go crazy.   
6) silver lining: bitcoin is an exciting new technology, but it comes with great risks, like planes are new tech but may crash. Take with caution. It may change the world, but if you're not careful, you're dead in a crashed plane.  
7) Obligatory Tulip bubble reference, warning gamblers once more  
Frankly it's not unlike a public service announcement not to gamble
Its just saying the China end is too heavy with rampant speculation, instead of trying to find actual uses for bitcoins (and so they should stop doing the former and start doing the latter). Compare with say Overstock and Zynga, where practical applications (bypass fees, reduce absurd wire transfers, international microtrade and microtransactions, virtual currency for virtual goods, perhaps future cost savings etc)
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:56:32
china gov will probably do whatever china gov wants to do, and btc co.s there will probably have to be flexible and work with that...
@_date: 2014-01-02 09:24:35
nice one, i didnt think of that! hahaha
@_date: 2014-01-15 09:16:57
My quick and sketchy take (please correct me if I'm wrong, couldn't catch some words)  
Starts from about 1 hr 10min ++  
1h16: 1) Bitcoin is not a currency  
2) Bitcoin speculation can lead to loss, so appropriate measures are required   
1h 17: Bitcoin is an intangible good. It is not a currency  
Currencies need to be a medium of exchange, medium of exchange for currencies. It has to be accepted widely, and not just by a few people. Currencies have to have inherent value.  
Gold for example is widely accepted. Gold also has inherent value, but is unfortunately scarce, and cannot be used for currency to facilitate economic growth. That is why we have fiat currencies in the world today. They are guaranteed by governments.    
1h 20: Now looking at bitcoins, does it have such characteristics? To my knowledge, most countries have not recognized bitcoins as currencies.  
  
A watch 200 RMB, A bottle, A car 20k to 30k RMB. How do you price it in bitcoin? Look at its crazy volatility, how do you use it as a currency? Which country has such a crazy currency? Can you use it to price items, or to store value?  
1h 24: We have no discrimination or intention to suppress bitcoin. We simply want to say that it is not a currency. Nor is it inherently a currency. As to its price, we will let the market decide. In the meantime, we must safeguard against the risks of bitcoin, and we will be watching it carefully.  
  this is the part that oxfeefee says is not in the transcript, another additional part is that they would like to have the markets determine its price instead (I think)
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:52:23
haha icic, has it been going well?
@_date: 2014-01-19 13:50:48
The spice trade! But with bitcoins! The world comes full circle again!
Age of Discovery: finding a new route and a New World
One of the major consequences of the spice trade was the discovery of the American continent by European explorers. Until the mid 15th century, trade with the east was achieved through the Silk Road...

消息称国内某银行已经主动找到一些大型比特币交易所开始接洽合作事宜  
person says banks in china may arrange something with the bitcoin exchanges  
谣言满天飞。我来给大家讲一点正面的消息： 国内某银行已经主动找到一些大型比特币交易所开始接洽合作事宜。 央妈没说银行不可以直接和交易所合作的。我为我讲的话100%负责。  
Rumors rumors everywhere. I bring positive news that: China banks have been talking with the bigger exchanges to arrange things. Mother PBOC never said banks couldn't directly deal with exchanges. I take 100% responsibility for what I say.

I thought the best part about this was the Cumbrian professor going: it's great it makes people think, what is money? what is currency? very important questions

at the last bitcoin meetup there was someone who was sharing his own experience of despite having one, due to bad decisions he ended selling bitcoins at a low and barely broke even
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:39:40
it seems bitcoins have not only freed up transactions across borders and space, but even through time itself
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:43:52
I'm from Singapore, the GST is the goods and services tax in Singapore that's at 7% and loosely equivalent to the european VAT.
In Singapore, investment grade bullion (gold and silver) are not taxed this GST due to recent legislation. Note that bitcoins are not treated as "gold and silver" or "investment grade bullion" at this point of time.
The wording is quite a bit on the messy side, but at the very least those going for buy and hold appears to go under the zero capital gains tax that the island has.
Taking it at cafes and shops will probably come under the 7% if they would come under it through legal tender (from my reading)
