Less money? This pool will have enough TXs to fill up their blocks but also it will contain more TXs in their blocks as they're smaller.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:02:28
You're forgetting about the impact it has on the users. Even a temporary loss of few % of income is justified when users realize "oh, we must adapt to segwit so our TXs are processed (at all, not only faster and cheaper)". Later it will snowball into most of the miners rejecting segwit. Also, UTXO growth reduction also saves costs for miners.

-donation to someone developing cheap energy technologies, i.e. hydrogenium or thorium based, better batteries, better energy transportation
-funding research on smart-contract based elections, auctions, insurances, etc.
-better transportation methods (not based on oil), electric cars but also magnetic trains, hyperloop etc.
-increased awareness on technocracy, e.g. TV ads, flyers, events, courses, perhaps a movie "technocracy is here" or a music video "cryptoanarchism is the new sexy"

Thirdly, how many of you cared enough to review the patch, and how many blindly installed it on your production machinery?

Yeah, but 3 GB seems not much useful. You should be able to store, let's say, all currently non-spent transactions there, so if you see a new one you will have something to say about its validity. 
So according to UTXO chart, it's 2.7GB, then you should think of blockchain overhead, signatures, I'd say 10GB is the absolute minimum.

Schnorr singatures will compress multisig TXs further.

Those coins would have to be planet-local for now as we cannot avoid double spending issue in electronic blockchain world while the electron speed is c. However, if you use LN and atomic swaps, it should be quite easy to scale up to the whole galaxy.
Simply, for each pair of planets a channel is created by the exchange brokers (e.g. BTC-MarsBTC). Now, if you feel like sending some wealth from Earth to Mars, you create an LN transaction that will take 12 minutes (with the speed of a lightning) to reach your recipient. Obviously, an exchange rate is used but you'll know it prior to locking the funds. And the underlying Blockchain transactions are not needed for as long as a non-empty channel path exists between you and the recipient.
Think of it like IP layer over the Ethernet layer. If one Ethernet collision domain was to serve all network adapters of one small country, the MTU, the bandwidth, the reliability of such network would be terrible. It's not effective and not needed to do it this way, hence IP was introduced. LN (or virtually any other layer-2 BTC protocol) is the natural step for scaling Bitcoin up.

The next technical steps are probably uninteresting for you. The technology is already there, the papers are written and reviewed, there are hundreds of fancy inventions that can be done with blockchain but only 100 people in the world can fully understand the papers itself. We are currently working for software engineers to create an ecosystem of tools, libraries, frameworks etc. for easy implementation of everything, everywhere. Just take a look at segwit, it brings benefit for everyone except roger ver but the adoption is still not 100%. And segwit is really plain and simple thing. Then, when the ecosystem is there, we need businesses to integrate it with their flows, that's going to be even harder and longer process, see warren buffet. Finally, when all this is done, try learning little children at schools how to secure their wallets. It's the mentality change, like introducing electricity. Give or take 60 years will pass before we fully release what we already have in whitepapers. So what will be the next step, technologically? What invention will the world need to add into BTC in 60 years? Smart contract scripts? Schnorr? Bulletproofs? Damn, really hard to say. But if you can guess and bet on it, you will be one of the Fortune's top 10 in 2078.

Now imagine the software/distro vendor provides me with the software this bad. I mean... seriously, in the times of UUID disk volumes, LVM, automounts and lots of other stuff, they cannot provide a robust installation script that doesn't crash in a not-that-rare scenario? Whoa... same with downloading blocks via torrent. I mean, I hope you at least run bitcoind with -rescan afterwards, don't you? How could a person expect to prosper in the p2p world of cryptography and anonymity if they cannot trust the tools they are using? Stop being so lazy, if you NEED Raspiblitz to run a LN node because you DON'T KNOW how to run any other LN distribution with BTC node then maybe you shouldn't be doing that in the first place? Seriously, maybe you should pay someone to keep your wallet away from you! For your own safety! Never thought of that? Also, are you reporting the bug on Reddit because there is no official support from RB community? Whoaa... I wouldn't put a dime in it then, or at least I wouldn't tell anyone. Come on, start reading docs by yourself, learn about Linux disk mounting, partitioning, perhaps installing Debian or other distros, compare the tools and choose the ones that suit your needs. Never trust anything you didn't check for yourself (including me, don't trust me! I might be lying now!), learn algebra and crypto, don't talk to anyone about your coins without anonymity, or you will eventually lose EVERYTHING (so my coins get more value so I don't care lol).

HODLers of BTC will soon recover the value lost by these fluctuations as BCH market share will drop from 10% to 0.1% (even now it's difficult to say: is it 5%? or is it 0?) and the panicking noobs will lose their investments.

I disagree. Just ignoring the problem does not cause it to go away (an ostrich method). Instead, we know them well for spreading FUD, making childish comments and noise in many ways whenever something in BTC world happens and they can use it to their benefit. So, in response, the least we can do is to point out the actual flashes of sanity from vendors, such as Bitpay today. Wouldn't you say that it's a good occasion to use Bitpay just today, to show them you respect blocking BCH payments?

This analysis lacks pragmatism. The scene apparently takes place at some concert. I would say the guy has a better viewing perspective than the others, he was just using his luckily achieved edge on mocking others and as soon as this objectively superior way of experiencing the conert was acknowledged by the mass, they have run to that place to exploit it. It had nothing to do with following the guy and in the end of the video we can't even longer see him there, he has got no recognition of his "noble deed".
Then, going back to I would say that we are currently using the edge we have, namely we have technical prowess to understand how crypto works and why is it objectively superior to the old financial solutions. Maybe some of us were randomly punished by the dollar-based systems (let's call it "luck") and somehow forced us to become interested in BTC. Or, simply, we just saw a lambo at our friend's garage and realized it didn't come from nowhere. But mass adoption won't happen just because we tell other people how we came into this or "be brave" or "treat others as equals". This has nothing to do with it. Mass adoption will follow when it will become economically unfeasible to continually conduct business using USD/EUR/etc., when the governments start bankrupting, or any other severe flaw in the legacy financial system becomes apparent and unbearable, making the cost of transition to BTC-based economy smaller than the perceivable profits from this transition. As always, there will be some lunatics or handicapped people who will persist in the legacy system (and those will go bankrupt ultimately), some early adopters (which we are not necessarily the part of - as we could just buy 100 BTC for $100 a few years ago and accidentally happen to be on the bright side before actual economic even transition became), some scammers and consultants... Nothing is really random in here and the attitude of the individuals towards new technologies or the fear of missing out... really, has nothing to do with it.

Get out of here. Create a smart contract on Ethereum, define what "the Bitcoin price" is (is it an average of 10 hard-coded currency exchanges or what), publish the code to us. If it works as I suppose it should, meaning it will distribute all the money that was bet on different prices to the 10% of the gamblers with best guesses (with a proportion of square distance) then I will happily bet $100 on this.
A pseudocode:
1. Phase one, accept bets during each December.  
a) whenever an incoming transaction comes together with a positive $xxxxxxxx.yy number, register it as a bet, otherwise return it as invalid bet (minus fees). Perhaps you wish to set the minimum bet to be at least $1 based at the last year's coin price (avoid spam).  
b) A registered bet is stored in public register: "address XXX has bet YYY dollars that Bitcoin price will be $ZZZ on 15 Aug next year"  
c) Bets can be updated. If the same sending address resubmits with another price, all the money he already placed in the bet will be now betting for the new price.
2. Phase 2, 1 Jan - 14 Aug each year, wait.
3. Phase 3, evaluate the price, reward the best gamblers:  
a) Do the math (as I said, example would be average from the 10 most popular exchanges, or maybe volume-weighted average, but what happens if they all die? will you promise to only update the contract in Phase 4?)  
b) Publish the price, e.g. send a transaction to yourself (looks like a bet) with the "correct answer" in the parameter. Let's call it X.  
c) For each gambler Y\_i, evaluate his absolute error Z\_i = abs(X-Y\_i)  
d) For each from the 10% of gamblers with the smallest Z\_i values, evaluate his fraction of the pie to take, I suppose P\_i = power(Z\_i, -2) / sum(i, power(Z\_i, -2)) could do, but could use stronger exponent. I'm not that good with mathematics. In fact, the right formula here is the most difficult part of this contraption, avoiding all kinds of anti-social players, small-bet spammers, billionaires trying to influence the result... Maybe you should actually allow placing bets during the whole year but award the early votes exponentially?  
e) Multiply the sum of money collected in phase 1 by the P\_i of each gambler, subtract the transaction fees, pay out the prizes exactly at 00:00:01 UTC of 15 August because it will take one second the network to pay up, won't it? No mysterious delays taking place in the process.  
f) Also collect 0.01% fee for yourself for organising this nice contest. It's not much but you will still probably get enough for a living just by being the first boy to do this.
4. Phase 4, 15 Aug-December: do nothing (return all funds being sent?).
If you succeed at this, ETFs on Bitcoin will be redundant and the whole world will see that Wall Street is obsolete. A nuclear war might be a result so think twice before you continue. You can also add an extra field in the step 1a to accept bets on different cryptos separately (perhaps with different lottery dates, e.g. 12 coins for 12 months with an option to replace one each month if it's in the corresponding Phase 4).

Every LN transaction is a valid BTC transaction, just not broadcasted until it is absolutely necessary.
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:29:07
A bidirectional payment channel is what folows. Alice and Bob generate a 2-of-2 transaction, say "Alice gets 0.05 BTC and Bob gets 0.05 BTC" (which is basically a copy of their inputs), but they do not publish it to the network. Now, each of them can publish it at any time (including the case when the other party becomes evil) but they can also keep it in limbo and later generate a new transaction called "deprecate the previous transaction, Alice gets 0.04 BTC and Bob gets 0.06 BTC", meaning that Alice transfered 0.01 BTC of her funds to Bob. Now if Alice wants to cheat Bob and publish the former transaction, Bob can publish the latter, as she already signed it too. The same scheme repeats with each next transaction, possibly indefinitely. The only case in which the transaction needs to be published and stored in blockchain is when the channel is getting closed (A &amp; B decide they don't need it anymore, or one of them timeouts, or becomes evil, etc.) but the intermediate transactions can occur for years at literally zero cost.
Now, network of such channels plus BGP-like routing is called Lightning Network. Clearly, it's not a fork, it's just a group of Bitcoin users agreeing with each other to make funny 2-of-2 Bitcoin transactions and delay publishing them.

Well, these are *dense* graphs so it might be problematic. I would start from selecting the top 5% nodes with the larget capacity / link count and put them in the center - hopefully most of the links exists within this subgraph and may help you to draw it without long edges. Then, the rest could be sorted by capacity and drawn orbiting around such core. Or perhaps draw 5 differently-sized orbitts, on each put the nodes of different size, hopefully orbit no. 5 will only have 0-link nodes, orbit no. 4 will have 1-link nodes (directly above their channel partners in orbit no 3.), etc.
Another approach would be just a world map based on the IP geolocation. Or remove links, just denote the capacity with the nodes' size (something like coin360 - but when you click a node then all linked nodes are highlighted). Finally, you could try 3d imaging (plus the IP geolocation, links coming through the inside of the globe).
