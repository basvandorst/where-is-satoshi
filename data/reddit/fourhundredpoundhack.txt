No, you're not. As a former Intel engineer, I decided to look into this whole affair, and find that the people are right.  I understand that normies care about memes, but people who put money into infrastructure care about their investments. 
From a political science point of view I also see blockstreams behavior as toxic, the idea of moving transactions off of the blockchain and using bitcoin as a settlement layer, is precisely the opposite of what I want out of a cryptocurrency.

Except, no I am a cloud systems engineer who works in a datacenter, so I don't think you know what the fuck you're talking about.
Please demonstrate the reason why bitcoin can't scale for global demand, since that was the goal of bitcoin from the beginning.

Except for the fact that Satoshi himself said that the block size should increase. 


Then why hasn't the block size increased over a year ago.

can the contract can be used as a reserve asset of some other coin, lets say to issue Trumpcoins whose value it supposed to be approximate, and who is able to be redeemed in bitcoin per the contract?
Congrats, you now have now used bitcoin akin to the "special drawing rights" like the current banking system.

Its an argument against the business model that Core is has patented, and what will inevitably happen if the block size is not increased to allow on chain scaling, thus what is likely their business model which is at odds with the business model of miners.

This makes you all look like retards, there is no terrorism going on, and you literally sound like OWS retards, blaming miners for wanting to scale on the chain, rather than destroy their own investments in hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware.
Why? because Segwit incentivizes keeping making blockchain transactions expensive and limited, so that we're forced into LN  sidechains and smart contracts, which resemble the sort of fractional reserve trading bitcoin was established to defeat. 
But hey fuck that satoshi guy who said we should increase block size and scale on chain, he was a fucking miner who horded millions of dollars in bitcoin that he kept all for himself, he shouldn't get to reward himself with that pesky proof of work.

They agreed to both bigger blocks and segwit over a year ago, the only people who wanted to cause these stalling tactics are Core.

Which is what every large financial institution will do, because the price to exchange bitcoin will be too high, and people will not be able to afford to directly trade on the blockchain, and every point of sale will support "visa-coin" payments, backed with the "full faith and credit of bitcoin".

I also do not support UASF and segwit, I want larger blocks.
