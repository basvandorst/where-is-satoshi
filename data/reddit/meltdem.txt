more fantastic advocacy work by coincenter - thanks to Jerry, Peter, Neeraj, Robin, and the entire CoinCenter team for their tireless work. i'm proud to support this organization, and the work they're doing for our community.

Most telling quote - "decentralization erodes the value of network effects over time, especially in platforms that rely on centralized data stores" - similar to the "walled garden" arguments around the demise of AOL as the gateway to the internet

Not surprised at all. Fidelity sponsored IDEO's bits + blocks lab at Harvard Business School this summer (which Dan Elitzer, who helped get the MIT Bitcoin Club started helped run for IDEO). They're also allowing people to fund fidelity charitable accounts - the second largest charity giving - using Coinbase bitcoin balances. They've invested in a several interesting projects, have hired a few industry folks, and i think they've been very under the radar (no vapor ware, no crazy PR unlike... ahem, others) and have been thoughtfully and quietly exploring and building. Also - the Johnson family who owns a majority stake in Fidelity is supposedly very interested in Bitcoin. Just sayin'
