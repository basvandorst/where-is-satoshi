I have heard the title, but nothing really about what it actually does. I think "google lightning network" is probably all I actually needed. I can probably take it from there. Thanks for the quick response!

The reverse effect also includes getting no media attention. People don't invest in things they don't know about and never hear about.

You should have led with this. If you started with “I don’t believe anyone in America should pay taxes and that is why I oppose this bill” then everyone could see the point you are getting at and make their opinions. The bottom line is that cryptocurrency is getting taxes or treated as a illegal offshore bank account. Those are the only two options. There isn’t a magical christmas-land where people and corporations can just store massive amounts of money without being taxed and be completely legal. That never had a chance of happening.

That seems like it would take longer that not prioritizing them. Why isn’t this getting beaten out by competing miners?

If the fees are rising, maybe it’s BTC that is coordinating it. I would understand if people were talking about something that isn’t actually happening.

While it’s growing, any line in the sand is going to be wrong. At 1 million, the smallest increment would be worth a penny and that would line up well. But any answer will be a poor one until things are more stable.

I’m partially commenting so I can mark the video to watch later, but I also wanted to ask a question and “the video covers it” is a completely valid answer if it does. 
If I make a LN exchange and it isn’t recorded on the block chain yet, what stops me from exchanging that same coin to another account through a normal transaction? I’m assuming there is some way to make sure this doesn’t happen, I just don’t see it (mostly because I’m super new to this and trying to understand it).

Exactly. If I saw on the news that it was above $15,000 and someone who seemed knowledgeable told me it was up to $20, I would lose all interest. The large number actually gets headlines and gets more people interested.

If you have an iPhone, you can use the coin base widget on the left of the main home screen. They you are just 1 swipe away from getting the current price. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:08:28
Oh, cool. I like the widget page better, but good to know I have options to compulsively check prices. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:06:03
Oh, okay. Thank you for being patient and helping me to understand.

So... having multiple millions of dollars doesn’t make you a multi-millionaire? That’s less than intuitive. TIL, I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:41:32
To be fair, millionaire ranges from having a million bucks to 999 times that much. He is just saying that by millionaire he doesn't mean he is deep in that range.

I think it’s more about cryptocurrency becoming more common that actually getting the money. It’s like a person getting their first direct deposit after living in an all cash world.

Not shocked that 2 shitty people don't get along. Ones a complete prick looking to measure dicks and the other is claiming to do an interview while telling the person their position on things. Neither seem to be the type of person you should actually give you time to. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:33:43
Yeah, it's a game changer. And by that I mean I'm fairly new and watching grass grow super hard. Hopefully I can give it a break a little. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:46:49
Do you have any sources that are 4 to 6 months old? I’d be interested in people who actually predicted the current trend. But I’m not interested at all in people who see an increase and make “analysis” that just says the current trend will continue forever.

Black Friday is probably the worst for it. Big ticket items (like large name brand TVs) are made specifically for Black Friday. They use cheaper components, thinner plastic, and often have shorter cords. It isn’t a sale; it is the shittiest model made by that company.  Often a refurbished or lesser known brand would be better than buying a TV on Black Friday. Also you don’t have to deal with the large amount of frantic idiots.

I mean, it worked for Calories. Not* sure about outside of the US, but America calls Kilocaleries “Calories”. The unit sucks and eating two million calories a day is really hard to track. So we just changed a decimal and got everyone on board. Now we have a much easier unit of measurement. 
Edit: typo*

I could be asking the question poorly due to my lack of experience in the area. I kinda get the idea of the framework, but how do you “move” bitcoins without them being recorded on the block chain? I get that the intention is the move them to a multisig address, but to all of the verifiers, wouldn’t I still have the coins if the transaction isn’t made public?
