There was a time when governments didn't trust electronics manufactured outside their country. This is why it's wise to have manufacturing propped up, you can deal with it in your jurisdiction.

You aren't converting the BTC into goods and services. You can't rely on it to be an investment forever, it's a *currency* use it.

What if some exchanges have a cap on the exchange rate, like between 300 and 800 $$ for BTC? Would that help control price volatility or would it not help retailers/consumers at all?

Yep and this is why I don't like reading mainstream newspapers or watching CNN or any other mainstream news. It's like they can't do the most basic fact-checking. Fire the most useless reporters and staffers and hire a fact checker -_-'

Price drop is the perfect time to buy up if BTC has a future. It's the same reason why Warren Buffet bought up some train companies and newspapers when the price was low; they aren't going to go bankrupt overnight and they're not going to completely disappear in the next few years either. When you're at the bottom, you can only go up (unless you really really fuck it up).

What you're basically saying is that bitcoins can be taken seriously now because there's lots of real dollars invested in them. That's awesome, it means BTC is here to stay.

He would still report it to the IRS when filing taxes as an asset or currency and pay tax on it so it's hardly anonymous.

If you're going to make money off the work of others,  just use capitalism and a regular currency.
