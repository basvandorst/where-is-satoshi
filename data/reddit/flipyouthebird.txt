You must sleep well at night, having it all figured out. Lol

Buddy you PM an address and I'll give you some skin in the game.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:27:12
Lol, what did the rest of the guys say?  Sounds like quite the defining moment in your life.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:06:03
Not really.  These comments just appear to indicate a lack of understanding of basic shit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:21:22

I wouldn't let worrying about 15 dollars stop me from buying.  If timing the market was easy, everyone would be doing it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:33:24
I completely agree.  Or buy some for him, or work out some chores to work it off.

Fuck off with your PSA.  Don't tell me what to do with my  money.
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:00:48
I'm not sure why, but I also imagine them being used in some sort of grand gesture like that.  Not any particular country though and not for a long time.
But then I remember how pointless that would be.  People would just start scamming and stealing left and right and ultimately some collection of ass clowns would end up withe all the coins.
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:56:07
Most adults you know struggle to like you.
It's ok though, you're really smart.

Have your lawyer send them your ID requirements?
Sucks that you have to do it, but you also didn't read the fine print.

Well I admire your patience. I just don't get how homie can just casually dispute you with weak stuff.

What's the character limit of the inner ring? 
@_date: 2017-02-04 08:22:02
-Asteroid mining will fuck up gold.
-EMP's/Solar Flares/Zombies/Prepper-whatever will fuck up everything that most everyone has the majority of the money tied-up in. Can 401k's/Bank accounts/stocks just flip back to paper?
-The lack of an apocalypse will fuck up bullets, guns and bunkers.
Everything is fucked when its specific worst case scenario plays out.  Quantum computing isn't just gonna step on the seen and tank the price anyway.  Pay attention and GTFO to the next one.

This sounds like the way to go.  Thank you for taking the time to answer.
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:14:17
Yeah, I left it on over night and it was showing as connected.
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:05:26
This sounds great.  Thank you very much.  Here I am thinking I have to wait on armory support the entire time.
@_date: 2017-02-16 10:47:25
You do good work here.  These posts infuriate me and here you are just patiently dropping knowledge.
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:58:20
Is this a yo' grandma joke?  Did grandma go to prom knocked up, then birthed and tossed the baby prom night?   Or was she knocked up on prom night, brought to term, then thrown in a dumpster on someone else's prom night? 
Or better yet, is this just a line of questioning only a sweet prom night dumpster baby would ask?
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:42:11
Hey, you changed your response!  Do you want to change it again and fix that contraction while YOU'RE at it?
I love my username lol.
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:59:08
Thanks you and for the advice.  I finally got around to it this morning.  Extracted private keys from Armory and imported to electrum.  +1 skills aquired.  
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:39:50
I've had a lot of issues this weekend with armory.  My last two transactions aren't showing up even though they are confirmed in another wallet and now all I get is errors trying to send out.  I've tried rescanning and rebuilding too.
@_date: 2017-02-26 09:49:00
Snooze-fest.  How do you plan on quadrupling your money again that way?

Listening to him on Stern over the years has made it difficult for me to figure out how I feel about him.  I cancelled sirius 4-5 years ago, so I don't know if he's done more.

It was definitely slow, but not that slow.
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:47:18
I like your style bud.  This BTC isn't gonna buy itself for you. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:19:55
It doesn't really take 'so much time and energy' to set up a wallet.  Maybe dicking around with faucets and trying to get free money does though. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:24:48
I did this back in July.  No regrets so far.
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:50:05
Bird retracted.  You seemed a little salty, doing better?  I understand the struggle.

@_date: 2016-01-22 23:42:47
Your "legal actions" will cost you more than than the ~$500 in btc you're fussing about.  You should totally do that though.
@_date: 2016-03-24 21:52:58
I'm waiting on 10 and I'm not whining.  We're so far from the original ship date, another week or month or months doesn't matter.
Is it annoying to see them available on other sites for full price before you have recieved yours?  Absolutely.  However, being a crowdfunder you bought yours at a discount, so you have that going for you.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:58:17
I know, I know.  I 401k too.  
Sounds like we bought around the same time!
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:26:19
I had nothing but good experiences/buys with Coinbase in 2014-2015, so I can't bitch about them really.  Worst was me getting annoyed getting two emails, a year apart, asking to explain my shit.
That being said, I've been using Gemini since December and it's fucking sweet, so I don't intend on looking back.
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:54:40
what's the hotwiring for settlement?
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:24:06
Thanks again!  It was probably a no-brainer for you but I was thinking I was stuck with no options.  They ended up responding to my ticket and told me to factory reset and that my copy of the chain was corrupt.
Give me one up top!  High Five @_date: 2017-03-24 08:18:06
lol. Easy bud, I was just referring to the rhetoric I remember.  I think it's shitty too.

My new all time favorite username I've seen on this sub.
@_date: 2017-03-05 11:46:31
This is the answer right here.  Gemini verified my account like the same day, but I've heard that's not always the case.  I'm in the mitten, so I didn't have to deal with NYC shit.  Sign up and wire that cash if they let you.
@_date: 2017-03-31 04:41:18
I've had zero issues the last two years, so it works just find for me.
What doesn't work for you?
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:23:57
You are a straight shooter and I respect that.  Can I get your contact info for my next DUI or domestic violence allegation?

This guy is a liar.  I am definitely not Satoshi.  Speak for yourself bro.

Terrified seems a tad over dramatic.  Unless flight-or-flight has kicked in, I think you are most likely very concerned.
Hiding from the raptors in JP1 is terrifying.  Hyperbolic post titles like yours discredit this sub.

I've been trying to give the Cash App my money for a month now with zero success. From day one I have not been able to add cash or buy BTC. All responses to my ticket have been automated confirmations, support has not replied to my case number once and there isn't a phone number I can call to try to move the issue.
I'm hoping I just have some glitch, but I don't know how much more patience I can muster up. Sorry for the bitching lol. I'm hoping others are having luck, I'm just sore about mine.
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:55:47
I know, what a fucking idiot.  I hope he's really embarrassed (or rolling in his grave) about this shit show he left the world.

Wouldn't Greece 2.0 just be: 
1.) atm withdrawl minimums
2.) talk about a haircut, and everyone paying their share.
3.) no significant affect to bitcoin/usd price, and
4.) This sub flooded with "Plan B" fan art posts (99% not being in the language of the country they are directed at).
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:31:38
I get that coinbase sucks, but your account name is fucking irresponsible.  Please humor me and tell me how you were wronged?
Outstanding call out, for the record.  Had no idea I was a fund manager too. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:06:50
Dood straight up disappears years ago, never put a real name out there and this joker is just now getting concerned with who's in charge, lol.
@_date: 2016-01-22 23:55:42
So the manipulation is by the banks this time and not the whale-bears?  Or have the whale-bears been the banks the whole time?
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:01:47
If they aren't willing to put in the leg work, let'em fall for it.  The Bitcoin CEO doesn't have rebranding in the 2017 budget anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:01:19
I had plenty of good experiences with Coinbase, but I also haven't used them in over a year.  I signed up with Gemini back in December and that's been awesome as well.
I think my Gemini account was verified the same day, which was awesome.
The $500 a day limit at Gemini seemed lame at first.  But really, if I want more that bad, I just need to take my lazy ass to the bank and set up a wire transfer.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:46:27
Calling someone an idiot isn't any way to persuade them.  YOU GO ON AND GET.

@_date: 2016-06-28 03:29:38
I ordered 10 from the crowd sale to give to friends.  No product or response to personal emails, just bad news and monthly excuse updates.
Pretty shitty but oh well.  First and last crowd funding buy for this guy.
Even shittier to hear they are sharp and come off as poorly made.
@_date: 2017-01-12 14:12:42
I don't know.  The friend seems to be reveling in OP's perceived bad decisions.  That's not a good friend.  And OP is saying the friend is still telling him what he's doing wrong 5 years later.  Dude might suck.
@_date: 2017-01-15 17:34:49
I've seen you all over the sub recently, it's been an exciting time.  Good news is I've been able to stop cringing and appreciate all the helpful responses that up mix in with the side show.  You commit some serious time to bitcoin and that's pretty cool.  
I think I remember you mentioning you were 61, because a you're goldbug v2.0 shtick  is new in town and notable.  You proud of your peers?  Seems like you are more interested in blowing up what your generation is handing off, and not patting yourself on the back like the rest of the guys your age.
That generation shit is lazy bro and you know it.  Truthfully, I don't even know if I am or not.  I've seen multiple ranges, but I also don't really give a shit.  I was born in 82, and in first grade we got shirts that said class of 2000.
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:54:07
I'm very happy with Cryptosteel.  I don't know what they cost these days, but a few of them will be cheaper than a safety deposit box. 
They are fun to put together, well-built and it's cool not having to trust some bozos with your phrase.  They have holes to put pad locks through, so you can prevent someone you'd normally trust from taking a peak.  
I was in your boat, so I bought 10 during the indiegogo campaign (lol why not).  It was a rollercoaster getting them, but at the end of the day I am super happy with them and very impressed by Wojtek.  Dude seems cool and he handled a lot of setbacks very well.  If he ever comes to Michigan I'd buy him a beer.
In other news, I still haven't decided where to put the fucking things yet though lol.  Get ready for that decision!
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:43:13

The same wind they came in on bruh. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:39:37
Looks like it!  If it keeps plunging after that, I'll probably start getting a little bummed because it'll just prove further I can't make sense of this stuff lol.
If 700 hundred is the new bottom though,  I'm pretty stoked.  Truthfully, I don't quite remember the jump from high 400s to 700, that one happened fast too.
@_date: 2017-01-01 07:48:46
Everything is possible, but what's more likely?  Come on dude.  
@_date: 2017-01-29 07:29:14
Just keep your btc at coinbase and keep your fingers crossed.  Nothing bad will probably happen, unless it does.
Or you know, you could put in a little effort and try to learn a new skill and understand the shit you bought.
You don't need to spend any money on a hardware wallet to get technically savy.  Are you incapable of learning new skills?
@_date: 2017-01-12 12:23:35
Who shits on their friends interests like that lol.  I'm overly annoyed from just reading this.  Plus dude thinks he's Walder Frey.   With friends like that OP.
@_date: 2017-01-01 06:46:48
Dude is taking his time to respond to you.  Don't resort to being a tool.
@_date: 2017-01-01 07:49:55
Since you are sloppy, Satoshi much be too.  Got it.

Bruh, why you gonna do me like that 2 months later?
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:39:58
You can withdraw from your 401k and roll over to a self-directed Roth IRA.
I can vouch for Broad Financial/Madison Trust.
@_date: 2017-01-14 18:50:28
I have a trezor and ledger and I like them both.  They both have their pros and cons but still do a good job.
You will probably feel more comfortable with a hardware wallet that was generated offline though.  But everyone is different.
If you have a decent chunk of change of btc, just consider it the cost of a fireproof safe for something you value.
Spend the money if it makes you feel more comfortable!
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:02:05
But it's already priced in bro.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:59:25

Currently, you can see a lot of support at the price.  However, we may be due for a substantial correction to the price.
Other observations worth noting:  Double-top, dead-cat-bounce, falling-knife, bull-trap, whale-pump.

Let us know when they hit your account.  I'm curious to see how long transactions going that way take.
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:58:30
how many years is double many?
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:26:25
You're still a bad ass for going that far.  You should still be proud you identified it's potential and made a boss play.  
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:22:20
I'm too much of a pussy to play the market.  I realized I wasn't cut out for that shit on e-trade.  I lost on everything I tried, I swear.  The only exception was a handful of stocks that dropped so much, that I just said fuck it on, and doubled/quadrupled downed.

@_date: 2017-08-17 08:06:47
Obviously, you won't have an opportunity to assess the situation when it hits 30x.
Lol but seriously, can you imagine how long that would take to cash out with daily withdrawal limits?
Or better yet, go sell it all on Localbtc and get fucking kidnapped.

For real.  Theres all kinds of cool shit being worked on.  Not everything is a fucking scam.  Some are scams.  Some can't pull it off.  Some focus on a niche and get after it.
Is everyone capable of contributing just supposed to sit on their hands?

At least they think it's legit.  They might just want advice from you.  How is your advice track record looking?

I wish you nothing but good fortune with your next bitcoin, bro.
@_date: 2017-01-14 18:35:05
I bought a trezor and ledger duo and really like them both.  They are fun to set up and messing with them helps me learn a little more and get more comfortable with bitcoin in general.
If you get a ledger, take the extra time and make the bootable usb stick with their ISO file.  It creates your wallet and gives the 24 word recovery offline.  It addresses ledgers biggest complaint/weakness.
I got burned having money and btc on bitfloor a couple years ago when they closed shop.  Coinkite was great website but then they went and shutdown.  It really sucks when you don't have access and obviously worse when you lose them completely.

I really appreciate your answer even though I'm not OP, so thank you!
Seems like the advantage with average cost is just ease and less complication.
If you've been buying all the way up this whole time, it seems like LIFO is the way to go.  I guess it just depends where the majority of your coin was purchased.
I think average cost is best for OP since he doesn't seem inclined to sitting down and getting dirty with the numbers.

Tying up someone's money like that is total bullshit when there is zero customer support.  I understand they have legit reasons sometimes, but you are entitled to a fucking explanation and steps necessary to address the issue.

I had a great experience with them yesterday.  If you have money stuck in dwolla, don't wait for your mt. gox verification or resort to dwolla--&gt;BitInstant--&gt;Mt.Gox.  
Dwolla--&gt;CampBX: my money was in my CampBX in under two hours.  Worst case, six hour wait (stated in their faq).  They have a nice, clean and easy to navigate website.
Dwolla still sucks though.  Don't use them if you do not have to.

I can't speak to exodus, but I have had great experiences with both poloniex and the shapeshift app.
Just dive in, use both and don't let overthinking the fees and every potential cent you could make hold you up from getting started.
You basically answered your own question anyway, right?  As a total beginner, why not start with the faster and easier option until your comfortable?
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:57:48
Yeah I guess that's pretty shitty advice these days lol.  Poloniex is sweet and pretty straight forward, so I'm sure you'll figure it out quickly.

An update would definitely be appreciated.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:52:46
Dwolla verifies your checking account.  CampBX mentions something about your account having to be 30 days old to fund with dwolla, but mine was only 4-5 and the transfer went through.  Mind you, this is putting money in.  Getting money out is always the harder part.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:55:18


Come on man.  
At least he took the time to respond to your post.  Start a conversation.  He shared his thoughts.  Now respond to his.  I get the sense his thoughts are pretty pervasive in this sub.  Make some counter points.  Share some reasons you are optimistic about litecoin.

It's a great time to buy.
You need to specify what country you are trying to buy in and what form of payment do you want to fund your exchange account with (bank account, cash, etc).  Also how much you are looking to put in.
You are going about it all wrong asking for a tutorial though.  That would imply you have done very little research (if any).  You should start by reading everything you can find on the right side of the screen.

There is limits too how much money you can transfer out of your mt.gox a day.  Something like $1,000 a day to start.
I do not believe you can deposit it directly to a bank account either via mt.gox.  You instead have to use in intermediary like Dwolla.  
It's a bigger hassle to convert to USD.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:21:07

Not totally hating on BitInstant.  In fact, I successfully used them going the cash--&gt;moneygram--&gt;ZipZap--&gt;Mt. Gox route 
(That way will cost you 3.99% in fees plus a 3.95 charge on the back end. End result $223.95 straight cash to $211.42 USD on Mt. Gox )
My coworker has had a couple hundred bucks tied up with Bitinstant for a few days now.  He tried to transfer dwolla--&gt;BitInstant--&gt;Mt.Gox.  That route failed for me too but luckily when I tried, the transaction failed and the money never left my account.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:39:18
I feel like you have a couple options but it depends what you have the stomach or patience for.
1.) I am sure you can get straight cash from an in-person transaction, but you will have to sell at a heavily discounted rate.  You will be paying a premium for cash and the immediacy.
2.) If you say you were a millionaire, I am assuming you have atleast  +4000 BTC.  Start buying these flats and porsches that are being sold for BTC.  A porsche went for 300 BTC the other day.  Stuff like that can be turned in to real cash in due time and it's value is much less volatile so you won't be losing any sleep.  Buy the most expensive/valuable stuff bitmit.com has to offer.
3.) Do what u/tozee already suggested, make an account with every exchange and just grind out those daily limits on every one of them.  I heard that once mt. gox verifies you, you can contact customer support to up your limits by 10X.
All those options have their risks and outside of the exchanges, you will not get the market rate.  Personally, I would do a combination of all three.  Cash, value in land/cars/whatever and money in your bank accounts.  
I want your problems son.

I would get in on that.  $5 or $1000, the end result would be worth it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:46:50
I am certain that is what he's saying.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:00:48
Just got verified after 10 days.  Highest was 12000 in the queue.
Funny thing is, the wait only made me learn easier ways to get in.  I will never trade on mt. gox again.
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:35:06
I have done three transfers.  Two took 4 days, one took 3.  My account was verified.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:04:03
Hedge your bet.  
Roll the dice with bitsinstant for $250 to mt. gox and set up a deposit with dwolla for the other $250.  
Worst case only half your money is tied up and bank/dwolla transfer is a sure thing in a couple days.
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:02:22
This really does appear to be the situation.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:50:35
What a fucking joke.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:59:05
Those definitely aren't panic sells.  Nor a group of like minded people who want to cash twenty bucks out.
That is text book shenanigans right there.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:42:32
I got bitcoins out tuesday and USD in yesterday.
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:05:42
That is pretty exciting.  How many hours would you say you throwing at it a week?
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:55:17
So far, my USD is just hanging out in my account.  I set up ACH last Thursday morning and as of right now that is still being reviewed.  I am not expecting anything until the middle of next week at the earliest.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:38:56
I have had luck with mt. gox and CampBX.  It's just that getting money in them sucks.  
I used cash via BitInstant to fund Mt. Gox and had my money in less than two hours total.  But you pay fees.
I used Dwolla to fund CampBX.  Dwolla took two days to verfify my bank account then another four days after that to process my BoA transaction.
Bitfloor has faster options but it has been hacked before and currently owes people money/coins.  I did not get a chance to try them because my money was tied up in bank to dwolla transaction period. 
Linking bank accounts and getting verified takes days and weeks.  So start up the verification process with mt. gox ASAP at the very least.  How you fund it, depends on your preferences/circumstances.
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:32:53
As long as the price is over $100 USD, I think any publicity is good publicity.  Everyone still respects the purchasing power of a c-note.

Mike Adams:  So **bold** it hurts.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:08:31
What country/city
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:43:32
I've always found tranferring money in to anything is much easier than transferring money out.  I am sure that's just a coincidence though...
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:30:23
You heard it here first people.  I solved the bifloor crisis.
Who's in charge of the parade?
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:13:02
Funding dwolla will take 3-4 days.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:11:39
Read r/bitcoin for a day.  Stop being lazy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:36:34
Now they are completely useless.  That was the one transaction I had with them that actually worked.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:55:38
Dwolla--&gt;Mt. Gox via BitInstant is a crap shoot.  Dwolla to CampBx worked very well for me.  That transfer took under two hours.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:12:45
How has your service been holding up with everything?  Are you pretty busy with it?
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:04:05
Try harder.
I'm not being douchey, you just seriously need to do the leg work to have a good understanding.
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:34:02
You have a bright future in consultation.  Could you look at my portfolio?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:14:27
Make sure to keep us updated.  This will be interesting to see how it plays out.
They stand to earn a lot of street cred if they don't flinch.

How will you spend your new found wealth?

I see you are being very bullish.
Brass balls.  You have them my friend.
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:58:15
I'll let you know how my $145 withdrawal out of there goes.  I'm sending my info tomorrow when I get to work.
I wish I would have gotten a heads up.  I found out just now when I logged in to pull the trigger.  I was waiting to buy all day.  For once I thought I would be patient and watch the ticker for an entire work day.  I fucking can't win at losing.
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:13:08
I would like to join this gang.  What's the initiation?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:13:48
I want to buy ASAP.  What time EST does mt.gox open back up tomorrow?
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:24:38
Defense noted.
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:23:05
More like last man standing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:41:49
I don't know, but I want them all.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:03:16
It's only temporary.  Apparently they shut it down to catch up with the high volume of orders.  It worked very well for me.  I am glad to hear it's still an option.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:30:35
I'll be ready to tomorrow when another bank transfer clears.  I wish I could now.
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:36:01
I know.  I don't think many people will report it.  I was just wondering what you would do.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:06:47
Seconded.  Fix your website before you start redditting.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:55:32
I imagine amazon will pull this soon.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:04:10
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:47:55
Truly remarkable insight.  Thank you for posting this amazing advice.

You are now my go to guy for indie software developement.  How does it feel?
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:24:54
lol.  I know right?
Just put the check in Tradehill.  Cash the whole thing into BTC and just refund accordingly.  $100/btc isn't a terrible price.  Obtaining BTC was the entire point of sending money to bitfloor to begin with.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:53:58
The VC's are on their way.  There is money to be made whether it's BTC or USD.  All the recent pub has chummed the water.  There will be more secure and capable exchanges soon.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:59:04
Oh come on, that was barely a fuck up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:19:10
I am not claiming a conspiracy with my accusation of shenanigans.  More power to the people with the time, smarts and resources to spam trades of .01btc and manipulate mt. gox how they want.  Clearly, they know what they are doing and are free to do it until someone gives a shit or provides a better service.
What I want to see is someone step in and create an exchange that prevents things like that from happening.  I will gladly give them my business and transaction fees for features that Mt. Gox doesn't seem to have any interest in providing.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:54:01
Re-distributing the wealth already I see.  Thanks for the gold, guy!
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:13:10
You sound about as bold as Mike Adams.
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:49:19
Don't you have a big announcement coming up in an hour?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:10:46
I would have gladly thrown an update in Japanese into google translate or at least begged a Japanese redditor to translate it for me.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:17:59
According to other posts, they only have one dude that handles all their issues, so of course customer service is going to be shit.  Too bad they don't put that on their website.
Litecoin, really?  May I ask, why do you see your $600 better converted to LTC than BTC?  Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:55:31
I am.  Step in to my office.
You're fucking fired.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:50:54
Locking you in to that price would be pretty shitty.  Best of luck!
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:46:52
You are coming off as a douche.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:04:06
Thumbs up for CampBX.  Opposite of the cluster-fuck that mt.gox can be on occasion.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:54:26
This is **r/bitcoin**.  Take that heresy to r/litecoin.  
Now scram!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:11:35
I am 100% with you.  If they want to swim in the deep end of the pool, they need to handle issues like these better.  
"Welp, were so busy we can't do it right" is not going to cut it for much longer.
Look at the bright side, at least you didn't buy at $260 today?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:22:03
The process of setting up and account and funding takes time.  Start this now since it costs nothing.  Do as much research as you can about it until then.
You should be able to answer your own question by the time you can actually fund your exchange account.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:48:35
Well the good news is you taught yourself a valuable lesson today.
However, if you are that jumpy about your investment, you might be biting off more than you can chew.

At least you have the stones to come out and admit it.  This place doesn't take kindly to sellers.

Kind of a lame move.

At least they are starting to communicate.
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:27:50
Additionally, one sentence on the bitfloor website does not constitute a detailed explanation.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:07:43
This is exactly what is happening to my coworker right now.  $250.00 tied up for two days now, ZERO communication.
Funny thing is, this could be saving him money right now (giving him more buying power later) with this little dip back to $200 USD/btc.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:59:32

Mooch food.  Buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:25:55
It was bound to happen eventually.  Everyone singing their praise was going to catch up with them sooner or later.  I hope they are back up in a couple hours when my bank transfer clears.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:43:29
 [Here]( it is.
I am pretty impressed with myself right now.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:33:23
Thanks for the update.  Now we just need someone who requested yesterday to post how long it took them.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:48:36
I do.  Call me greedy, but I just wanted the clarification.  You seem like you know a couple things.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:13:37
Well if it isn't Mr. new money!  How did you feel about todays excitement with your new found wealth?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:54
The fault lies with me.  I am clearly just upset with myself at this point.
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:17:39
Would you report any money you make on them?  I'm just curious.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:59:07
Also this guy
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:43:06
Welp, I guess no birthday card from Uncle Dave this year.
Where did you borrow the $40,000 from?
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:02:14
Not being a smart ass.  Don't a lot of kickstarter projects basically do just this?  Just not illegal because it involves a lot more goodwill and you are not guaranteed anything?
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:44:36
I'm stuck right there with you.  The more I read, the the more I feel like I don't need one unless I had like hundreds of BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:38:28
Fine, you win.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:52:55
That is the best reason/excuse I have heard yet.
If that is the case, then they still shouldn't continue to take orders while rolling out new models and spit-balling release dates while they have a cash flow problem.
Also, they should be cashing out some bitcoins to solve their cashflow problem.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:04:41
So what price are we looking forward to seeing tomorrow?
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:12:14
CampBx is great.  But for all I know, they are going to be targeted next.  Get in, buy, transfer out.  What a pain in the dick.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:19:59
I had a buy order at 20USD while I was sleeping.  No luck.
I guess that is a good thing.
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:11:59
That is what has me disappointed too.  I was ready to buy at the market value when I signed in and found out trading was suspending.  Funding these exchanges is such a pain so finally getting money in and not being able to use it just sucks hard.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:00:38
How do you plan on acquiring your bitcoin (what exchange, currency, method of funding said exchange)?
You are going to be in for some disappointment if you think you can just sign up on mt.gox and start "wheelin' and dealin'".  That is unless you already deal in some other form of electronic currency.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:30:52
It seems bitinstant is a roll of the dice at this point.  I had luck with my one and only transaction with them, but the fees were brutal and I am not willing to risk having a couple hundred bucks tied up for who knows how long.
Dwolla is reliable but you have to be patient.  Unfortunately, with bitfloor down, I don't believe there are any safe and faster alternatives.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:08:53

I am willing to bet a few may have changed hands.

How have you come in to bitcoins and still be unaware how to send them?

Everyone that uses coinbase regularly complains how they do not have coins available to buy/trade.  They have some sort of limit.
