Once I only get $38 for my $50, I will stop using a debt card.

Just leave em. So many people who invested late have to be staunch supporters, otherwise they are stupid investors. They will learn their lesson. I play online poker with bitcoin and I only get $38 from my $50 deposit. Coinbase takes a fee then there are transfer fees after it goes from wallet to site. I get around the coinbase fee through gdax transfer, but the end result is the same. Huge fees. The fees will never allow bitcoin to be a long term, relevant currency.

Appreciate it, but I've accepted my fate as well. Good luck and I hope you get out with crypto.

BTC will overtake all fiat currency within 5 years. Then we will all laugh to the bank.

Fiat currency will die within 3 years and bitcoin will take over. Each bitcoin will be worth $1M and the people who bought will become the new elite .01%. Then I will laugh at all my relatives that worked hard and became investment bankers and doctors that who are now paupers who laughed at bitcoin. Warren Buffet who?

So you are relying on Govts' ruining the banking system and official currency before Bitcoin will be used as an everyday currency?

I think you're talking about gold and silver.
