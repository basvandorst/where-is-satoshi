They're so deluded they made a posting celebrating 9 years of the 'Genesis' Bitcoin like r/Bitcoin did with the very first block being mined and they even link it to a site calling it the "Bitcoin Cash" Block 0 and the reward for the block in BCH!!!
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:50:26
I wouldn't say 0.12BTC is a "small" amount of money!

It's 11pm and I really don't want to go to bed I'm way too engrossed.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:01:50
Thumbnail actually did look like Bitcoin at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:55
Gave me a giggle.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:09:56
Exactly, I'm prepared if it drops again, I'll just keep hodling on and enjoy the ride as we go.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:11:30
Yup I got charged twice at £9.50 a pop just to send a few bloody Euros, wish I'd known sooner but once I did a quick search including "Coinbase" and "Withdraw" it's like opening the gates of Hades of horror stories involving Coinbase and their terrible support, it's shit like this that leaves a sour taste for Bitcoin newcomers.

It's technically not a movie it's from a documentary regarding Chernobyl, it's a good watch ��

To complete Step 8 I'd first need to complete step 8 but in order to do that I'd need to complete Step 8 which requires completing Step 8 as a prerequisite...
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:45:59
No time like the present, invest only what you would feel comfortable losing, sit back, and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:04:35
Ahh usual crap!
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:55:10
Had a work colleague randomly ask me about Bitcoin the the other day, then the other was like "Oh yea it's like currency that you mine from hard drives"... they are not technically minded whatsoever and I have never facepalmed so hard in my life.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:06:55
Wait it broke 13k? When? I've been checking a few times and it's been hovering around 12.6-12.7k
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:04:57
I'm part of the 10% of 21 Million does that count ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:46:05
What was said? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:05:01
Wasn't that drop to do with the Mt.Gox collapse?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:29:33
Oh I was half expecting a punchline ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:38:15
I know just joking around with what's happened recently haha
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:40:53
Just had a freaky vision of the future then...
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:58:09
Yea I had a massive headache and stress trying to figure out how to get over a grand from Coinbase back to me, I'd never use them again, only GDAX and then from there into my Wallet to be sold on Localbitcoins, stupidly GDAX transfers the whole amount of BTC you have for free where-as Coinbase take a small percentage off to transfer it to your wallet... which is ridiculous because GDAX IS Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:07:18
lol timing, they received my payment yesterday which went into my EUR wallet but they still haven't verified my bank account so I transferred the EUR into GDAX, bought more BTC and transferred it outta' there xD
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:28:06
I've literally lost count of how many times I've heard "will there be a bubble?" or "will the bubble burst?"... all the while BTC keeps pointing towards the moon ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:06:29
Charming, my account is 100% empty and the last transaction I made was yesterday which by now has at least 120 confirmations so... yea, sorry for being retarded though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:23:52
Ok one more time... I have no money in Coinbase, I've never kept just raw currency in their it's only been straight BTC purchases, there is nothing to clear into my bank and all my BTC is within my Electrum wallet, all of it, so again there is NOTHING left to be transferred, withdrawn, confirmed, cleared... NOTHING.
Anything else you wish to add from up there?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:14
I wanna BUY goddamnit, I feel like a a crack-head waiting for a slither of coke right now :(
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:00:53
Alas it was never to be ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:56:53
I just typed in my current 'investment' but when I added the decimal place for the pennies it reckons I'm in negative £43,852.
Rounded up with no decimal place shows the % gain correctly.
Just a little heads up.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:01:18
I may even have an extra half a sugar with my tea with how riveting this is making me feel.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:31
Good stuff all working now!
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:58:02
Caught in a landslide.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:32:03
I've been following Cryptocoins since about 2013 (mined a few different coins, none of real importance) and have only just come back to BTC after being away for years and I'm enjoying the ride so far, I've seen something about a "Hard Fork"? What is this and is it something I should be concerned about?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:10
Just had flashbacks of Vice City.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:41:28
I gave up with Coinbase, I transferred my BTC out of there and sold it on Localbitcoins instead, worked out about the same after the EUR -&gt; GBP exchange fee + international transfer fee that would've been deducted from the money transferred from Coinbase... whenever that would've happened.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:03:04
I would do that tonight if I weren't preoccupied ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:31:55
Ahh I getcha, well yea that's one way to put it, money on tobacco is 100% never coming back to you but with Bitcoin as long as you are comfortable you can afford to lose what you purchase Bitcoin with then it's a million times better than just smoking it away, plus smoking only gives you relief for what maybe an hour or so? But Bitcoin you're in for a long ride baby ;D
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:54:32
Officially $14,000!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:31:10
OMG I just burst out with laughter ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:06:43
I'm a bit ambiguous on BCH but does that mean I also have BCH I can claim? I've already got an Electrum wallet for my BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:03:59
Saying that it's getting blimmin' close.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:26:11
Yea they'll release a roadmap schedule and when you least ex-*BOOM* RELEASED.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:22:45
Smoking makes your life better? I don't think that was a very good analogy to explain to your family.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:28
I remember it like it was yesterday... hang on a sec.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:36:17
Fellow Brit hodler here reporting in.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:24:04
It's no biggie it's more the principle if I'm honest, I don't want anything to do with them anymore and the sooner my hands are washed of them the better.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:39:16
If not here hopefully over at r/BitcoinUK
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:00:23
Indeed! Keep hodling that BTC for as long as you can, in regards to the 0.12 BCH I've not really got experience with BitcoinCash so can't help you there I'm afraid ��

I've no idea but at the moment it's offering to buy BTC at the equivalent of $16.8k... either it's impossible to register and get verified at it's clearly South Korean-based or there's some kind of clause with it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:44:36
Exactly, it's like going to Lemonparty.com because you want to setup a party with a lemon theme but it's not what it seems.
...please don't actually go there.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:30:56
Do we have 15k memes at the ready? Won't be bloody long at this rate ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:20:18
Nothing! 
It literally says the last step is to close my account which it won't even let me do!
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:37:52
This is glorious, would have to hit 12k nearing Xmas time too ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:20:27
Will be ready for it ;)

Marry this woman... if she's not already taken.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:16:25
Woah man, woah.
First things first, if you have other more important financial commitments then withdraw what you have and pay them off ASAP, difference being if you're in the negative with Bitcoin then yea you've just lost money but at least you won't have bailiffs showing up at your door, being behind on your rent or anything else like that then it's a different story.
Cash out NOW, pay off whatever of your rent that you can afford so you're up to date and accept the temporary loss, I know from personal experience that being in thousands of debt is a scary place to be but take it slow and steady and once you start paying things back you'll soon look back with a sigh of relief.
Good luck.

"Bought the dip"... you mean from the dip of last week? Or the week before that? Or the week before that? Or the week before that?
I've been involved in BTC for a while now but it just makes me laugh when people say buy the dip, it's not a dip if it dropped 60% in the past 4 months, that's a landslide.
