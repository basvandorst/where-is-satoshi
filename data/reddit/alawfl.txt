Many already do.  Even more flexible is donating to a DAF 
It especially makes a lot of sense from a tax point of view with the recent price increases. (If you're a HOLDer, you can always immediately re-purchase, instantly upping the cost basis to the current price.)

Don't forget you need a [bitcoin appraisal]( to take advantage of the tax benefits in the US if you give big.

Some obvious and common suggestions that are totally approved by the IRS: 
(1) Gift to charity. No taxes at all (assuming of course it's a bona fide fide gift to a qualified public charity). If you came into 10 million, surely you can afford to do this. And you can discount any gifts against actual income from sales you keep. 
(2) Hold for at least a year. You still owe long-term capital gains (IRS notice 2014-21), but it's a lot lower than standard income tax, and
(3) Hold for a lot longer, hoping the tax situation changes. You don't owe 'till you sell. Maybe not ever, but worth holding some just in case.
Setting up an S-corp whose primary purpose is to give you a lavish lifestyle based on crypto profits without paying taxes is shady at best, and is likely to bite you in the end. This is different than a legitimate business that has as a small portion of its expenditures providing (nice but limited) perks and benefits to key employees or owners as operating expenses.

I thought reading the Bitcoin Whitepaper was dangerous!

Exactly. Transaction fees are down because far fewer people are using Bitcoin. Stripe, Steam, Microsoft, and others have stopped accepting it, for one.

We have decided as a society that being physically stronger does not give one the right to prey on the physically weaker. Does the same not apply to intellectual or emotional strengths (even if we somehow manage to even out educational opportunities)?

I wish computers stopped people from making dumb choices, but more often than not they seem to amplify stupidity (or at least the consciences thereof) rather than reduce it.

Yes, I have, both directly and more recently via a Donor Advised Fund (e.g.  ) which has the advantage that you can gift whenever it's convenient to you, and then give to virtually any charity (and it simplifies taxes too to have a single "recipient" (though you still may need a qualified appraisal for gifts over $5,000)).

I talked to a couple of appraisers I hunted down on  . Most were not interested at all (actually, the vast majority didn't even respond to my inquiries), and the only two that made offers wanted to charge $500+hours and $1000 respectively. However, I did recently find  that looks like it has much more reasonable rates for Bitcoin appraisals (only $120 for a single donation).  Certainly a lack of people in this space. 
(Nit, the amount of Bitcoin that requires qualified appraisal is actually $5,000+. Between $500 and $5,000 you can file the form yourself filling in your own FMV based on exchanges.)

That list hasn't been updated in a while, but is a great start. GiveDirectly [now accepts bitcoin]( too. 
Also, another great option is Donor Advised Funds, which are a great way to gift Bitcoin (and other cryptos) to virtually *any* charity with full control over gift timing (for tax reasons, even taking the deduction one year and deciding who it goes to the next). Both [Fidelity Charitable]( and [DonorsTrust]( have seen the light here. Of course for gifts of more than $5k the IRS requires a [qualified Bitcoin appraisal]( to allow taking the deduction.
If you're a HODLer, you can gift and immediately buy back, locking in a higher cost basis tax-free.

Welcome to the rollercoaster!

Given that crypo is both a bearer asset and highly volatile, being wary of *lending* money to purchase crypto makes good financial sense. You generally can't even buy good old-fashioned stocks with credit cards. (Margin trading is different, as the exchange retains the ability to call its funds back before you go underwater.)
Cutting of debit cards, wire transfers, etc. is a different story.
