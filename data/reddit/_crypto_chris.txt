You must be talking about utility in the 20th century term of the word. Because as it stands, BTC’s utility is paramount within the current crypt-verse, it is the only crypto currency used universally amongst all exchanges. Want to trade an Alt? You need to go buy some BTC first then exchange. Bitcoin may be pricey, outdated and slow but it was first and it’s hovering at 50% of a half a trillion dollar market cap, so its still considered the “global currency” in the crypto world. If you like analogies, consider BTC the ocean, and all other Alts being boats, sure some are really big yachts and others are paddle boats but remember when the ocean rises, all boats rise with it and vice versa.

Exactly, it’s really amazing to witness.

Then why can’t they afford larger servers and not have their site crash every time a spike occurs.

Yes, this is correct and I agree. But also keep in mind that the bitcoin/altcoin market is currently comprised of mainly retail investors and that means institutional investment hasn’t yet entered (futures only and that’s barely a week). 
Think of a new product and it’s adoption curve, when it first enters the market, it’s comprised of only innovators and early adopters, before it enters mainstream maturity and mass adoption. That’s where bitcoin is now and altcoins are fast approaching- which won’t take nearly as long as bitcoin did, like everything once the trailblazer lays down the path, the others follow suit in droves. So we are talking about tens of trillions of untapped global investment funds just watching the cryptos, salivating and even if they only allocate into a small percentage of it, that’s it, that’s all it’s going to take to bring cryptos to another climactic bull run.

Tough not to buy at the ATH’s when every day is a new one! But very sound advice, heed.
