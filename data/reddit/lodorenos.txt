My favorite moment was buying game maker with bitcoin and learning a ton with it in the following months. That $11 is worth $20 now but I have no regrets.

If you have an address with lots of input transactions that tx fee will rise sharply.

My phone gets about 18H/s (OnePlus One) mining Monero, calculating that out gives me a profit of $0.0036/week. Not counting electricity costs. 1/3rd of a penny per week. Worth it? Hell no. Fun to do? Sure.

Yep. The blockchain itself was never paused.

Yes exactly. I have a Trezor myself so I'm not sure of the specific workings of a Ledger but it should be very similar. You connect the device via USB and use software (eg. A Chrome extension for Trezor) to interact with the device. When I want to send BTC or whatever coin I'm working with, I'll initiate the transaction on the computer with said software and then I'll have to confirm it on the Trezor.

None of them are worth the time imo, the developer profits from you watching ads. If you actually mined on your phone you'd generate about nothing per year.

The online computer can have malware which for example can read your screen, control your computer, and access your files. Such files include (unencrypted) wallet.dat files (bye BTC). Computer access also means someone who infected your machine can wait until you unlock your wallet and note the password using a key logger (again, bye coins). An attack can even include changing the sending address begind the scenes, making you send coins to an address owned by the "hacker"/script kid, whoever.
Hardwallets and paperwallets are immune to these attack vectors IF you set them up properly. Storing a PDF of the paper wallet in your Dropbox for example is an excellent way to nullify the whole point of an offline wallet.

Same error, even on the normal site. Probably just temporary and if you followed the instructions and have your mnemonic written down you have nothing to worry about as you can always recover to a different wallet.

The go-to these days for people without ASICs is mining altcoins that are ASIC resistant and selling those for BTC. After considering power costs and hardware degregation, it's probably not worth it.

Must be interesting knowing you "paid" more and more for that car as each day passes if the upward trend keeps up over the years. Of course I can say the same for any purchase with BTC, but the value of a Lamborghini is a bit higher than that.

Good questions! There are tons of articles and videos explaining everything you'd ever want to know about the blockchain but the tl;dr version is something like this:
It's called a paper wallet. Make sure you create paper wallets on a computer that's not connected to the internet, preferably a live Linux DVD or similar.
Your coins aren't actually stored on the paper wallet, they're on the blockchain on millions of computers around the world. The paper wallet (and any wallet) holds the private key which enables you to spend BTC in the relevant public address. You can get an address from a private key instantly, but you can't get a private key from an address.
Imagine you put $100,000 in a safe and wrote down the lock combination. The paper with the combination in itself is worth nothing, no money is on the paper and you can't do much with it besides OPENING that safe to access the funds. Private keys are similar.

Mainly the people who aren't holding I think. People who plan to let it chill for months/years probably don't care much for daily dips.

Afaik there's the BCH and BCG forks that may be worth a little bit of BTC. Easy enough to check those two by looking at the BTC value in that address on the fork day. If forking happens more often an app or website would be pretty neat.

Linux doesn't automatically make it secure, the best protection is yourself. But yes, a Linux distribution that is only used as a means to run the core wallet is pretty damn secure.

Sure thing! If you'd like to give mining a shot on a phone you don't care much about, you can install minergate from the play store. It's from the same company that runs Changelly. Your phone will likely overheat, demolish the battery, and use more electricity costs than you're likely to generate but hey, you can say you mined crypto on a phone.

I don't recall ragging on this person's decision to buy a Lamborghini with bitcoin. Good on him! The point I was trying to make was that if BTC rises in a few years to say, $100,000, that car would have been paid in theoretical millions of "could have had" money.
I see people joke about that guy who ordered a pizza for 10,000 BTC years ago, this is similar.

The hardware wallet holds coins, the exchange holds coins (well, it holds the private keys that give you access to the coins). You can send them between each other (exchange-&gt;hardwallet &amp; hardwallet-&gt;exchange) and you don't need a middle man.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:33:59
Explained in another thread, copied the text but lost the link. I didn't write this but it's one of the best explanations I've seen. 
Well you can send bitcoin to two types of addresses.
Addresses that start with a 1 represent a single public key, that has been hashed into an address. So someone out there generates a private key with their wallet, converts it to a public key, then hashes that to create an address. This is the classic, traditional, old fashioned bitcoin address. You send money to it, and the person who holds the original private key can then spend it themselves. This is called paying to a public key hash. 
Addresses that start with a 3 are more complex. Instead of generating that address by hashing a public key, instead what you hash is a SCRIPT! Wow what's that. A script is a set of instructions written in bitcoin script op codes that run a little program before the coin can be spent again. The popular use case for this is multisig. So if I run a company (like dark wallet, or ethereum) and I want our bitcoins to require multiple signatures to spend, I cook up a script that says "2 of 3 to spend" hash it, and thus create a pay to script hash address. 
Edit:

Had the same issue. Max "exchange" was locked to $499,99 or around there and no matter how many times you pressed "next" it would never advance to step 2. I ended up using the send feature to load the BCH into a wallet and sold them from there. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:44:08
I understand it wouldn't be very useful as you can just send yourself the coins normally but I wanted to make sure that it's possible.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:30:07
It's not his wallet, he asked where to find the public key (unhashed address). 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:07:03
Alright, you seem to know what you're doing. I don't disagree with you, I dislike BCH and the confusion it creates.

Interestingly enough another thread popped up dealing with this exact issue: 
As for what the "best" way to avoid this is, avoid using one address to store both your main BTC and using it to collect faucet/mining transactions which are usually paid out in very small amounts per transaction.
If I'm wrong about any of this I'd love to hear why.

@_date: 2015-02-14 18:56:05
Well, not quite. I remember the earlier days when even CPU mining was still profitable, followed by the GPU days and the brand new "super miner" ASICs. It's strange to look at these devices now and know that they will never again serve a purpose.
