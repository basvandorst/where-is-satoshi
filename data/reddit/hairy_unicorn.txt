It seems that "Blockchain" as it's envisioned by VCs and the media is really just a shared database that's controlled by a set of trusted validators. That actually does sound useful, but it's an incremental improvement to the database security model and it's not terribly revolutionary. 
I think it will become clear that true "blockchain technology", with its cumbersome nature and inefficiencies that are the necessary byproducts of censorship resistance (the only reason IMO to employ blockchain technology), is probably limited to very few applications - most notably cryptocurrency. And what the "blockchain technology" proponents seem to keep missing is that cryptocurrency is the revolution, not the underlying blockchain technology piece.

Then you haven't been reading very much. BIP 101 is naive and aggressive. It just says "let's pull a growth figure out of our assess and hope that it's OK." 
It pretends that blocksize-related centralization pressures don't exist, or handwaves them away. A major concern is that [selfish mining attacks]( are much more effective when block sizes are large.  Large blocksizes also guarantee that fewer nodes will be run by individuals. 
These effects need to be studied and mitigated if Bitcoin is to have any future as a decentralized digital bearer asset. BIP 101 is like tying a rocket to a car and not worrying about the suspension, brakes, and aerodynamics. It's reckless and insane.

Right, but we're a bunch of enthusiasts for trustless consensus. Cryptocurrencies are fundamentally about trustless consensus. And as you say, that requires PoW.

I disagree. Bitcoin should be, first and foremost, the most trustworthy and censorship-free digital bearer asset on the internet. That alone is a titanic goal to achieve.
All the other use cases that turn Bitcoin into a general asset register detract from that primary purpose. A general asset register isn't terribly revolutionary since it deals in IOUs - something that has been possible for decades using legacy technology. 
An uncensorable digital asset has never been seen before, and it is what we need to focus our time and energy on. If Bitcoin can be successful at that, then it can be a solid platform for all the other use cases (as higher protocol layers).

@_date: 2015-12-17 20:49:22
So, Bitcoin is this great distributed and portable store-of-value that can't censored, a digital bearer asset, the first of its kind. It's made possible by combining proof-of-work, digital signatures, and a blockchain, which taken together allow for consensus on transaction ordering and the prevention of double spending. It's a solution to the Byzantine Generals problem. It's quite a breakthrough, but you can't isolate one of those fundamental technology components and call that a breakthrough by itself.
Then a bunch of companies and foundations and non-technical tech evangelists and whatnot come along and proclaim "nobody wants a digital bearer asset. What they *really* want is that data structure, the blockchain!" 
OK, I guess, but blockchains have been around for a long time, in the form of Merkle trees and variants thereof. Something like Ripple or whatever R3CEV is working on or whatever gimped thing comes out of this Linux Foundation effort (assuming they avoid proof-of-work) were likely possible using existing technology a decade ago, before Satoshi's breakthrough.
My point is that there's so much more to Bitcoin than just a friggin' blockchain. The revolution is an uncensorable digital bearer asset and how that puts financial control back into the hands of individuals. It's right here and working, a marvel to behold, and yet all this money and talent is being wasted on trying to figure out how to make blockchains replace shared databases or some other handwavy goal.

Bitcoin excels at being a transferable digital bearer asset that can't be censored - I don't think that can really be contested. 
Yes, it's not a great general asset register, or an IOU register, and it was never mean to be.
And it's true that the raw Bitcoin network is not an ultra-cheap payment system that will stand toe to toe with a centralized system like Visa's.
In the early days of Bitcoin, a lot of really fantastic claims were made about what it could do based on naive assumptions and a lack of understanding of what exactly Bitcoin is. I believe that the schism we currently see in the community is a hangover from that misunderstanding. 
That doesn't mean that Bitcoin can't serve as the base layer for other protocols, such as lightning or sidechains, so that eventually all use cases can indeed be fulfilled.

Depends on who you ask, but even 1.7MB is pretty good, and it's ready to go *now*.

I've never heard this before - this seems like a novel claim. And I'm well informed on the subject. If you're referring to Lightning then you're deeply misinformed.


For some definitions of *complex* I suppose. It's been extremely well tested and the Core development community (hundreds of contributors) is satisfied that it isn't too complex for deployment.

The problem is that the r-btc side is emotionally invested in a outdated understanding of how Bitcoin will scale ("just change the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE parameter to 2MB"). 
So when you try to make arguments about why the SegWit scaling approach is safer and that it solves some critical technical problems (transaction malleability) and paves the way for further scaling, you get downvoted into oblivion.
You also get mercilessly downvoted if you argue against the paranoid conspiracy theories they espouse. For example, they believe that a developer-founded company called  Blockstream has taken over the open-source Core project, which is obviously ridiculous. However, just try to suggest that and you'll be angrily dismissed.

Ethereum had no problem with uncontentious forks, things like protocol upgrades that had broad consensus.
 But when they had a contentious fork (that gave a mulligan to the holders of a contract  that had an unexpected outcome), Ethereum split into two viable chains - ETH and ETC - supported by those who were for and against the fork.
That split will also happen to bitcoin if the hard fork is contentious.
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:57:58
I must admit that I want this as well. If BU miners and node operators forked to their own coin (I don't even care if they call it "Bitcoin"), then we can get on with proper scaling. I wanted to avoid a hard fork but it appears that certain large mining entities and Roger Ver may be forcing this to happen. If a fork has to happen, we might as well get it over with. Both sides seem to think that their chain will be the most valuable but I know which one I'll be betting on.

In the early days of Bitcoin, some of its most prominent evangelists had spread the message that Bitcoin was destined for Visa-scale, and that it would be a global payment system that could satisfy all use cases, including microtransactions. Not only that, the Bitcoin blockchain would serve as a general database for an endless variety of apps. 
Very little attention was given to how this could be possible while Bitcoin retained its core value proposition: censorship resistance arising from decentralization. But it didn't seem to matter because everyone was so excited that Bitcoin existed at all, and everything seemed possible.
Those early promises still echo through these and other message forums, long after they've been dismissed by people with technical insight as fundamentally in opposition to what Bitcoin excels at: being censorship-resistant money. And as Szabo points out very eloquently, censorship resistance is expensive. 
Bitcoin cannot be a cheap payments network at the base layer. It must first establish itself as a valuable, globally transferable digital asset that is **highly resistant** to censorship. If it doesn't do that, then there really isn't much of reason for Bitcoin to exist.
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:28:44
A compromise of principles kills the project. There will be no "compromise", only a developer's consensus of what's best for Bitcoin will keep it alive. 
The best path forward, IMO, is for BU and Jihan to implement larger blocks and take their fork off into the sunset.  Both sides need to go their separate ways, because we clearly are strongly ideologically divided.

I believe that Wright did support BU or some form of big blocks. It would have been a big win for the big block side to have Satoshi come back and declare that big blocks were the solution to the scaling debate.
The whole thing stunk. Wright was so obviously not Satoshi - it would have been a simple matter of signing a message using a privkey from an early block - but Gavin and Matonis and the rest of them expected us to believe it based on his fast talk (which was actually nonsensical rambling) and a magic show that he put on in a hotel room.

@_date: 2016-03-07 19:06:51
Same here. Holder since mid-2011. Bitcoin is digital gold, cash, whatever. Visa-scale payment system never interested me. It just has to be a secure and censorship-free bearer asset for it to have a unique value proposition. Higher protocol layers can handle handle high volume payments if people care about that sort of thing.
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:42:34
It does make sense, but it ignores the political reality that people want to see something done to address scaling right away. Going to 2MB immediately would have little negative impact on the system, and it would be a signal to the community that the Core developers are listening. Sometimes you have to compromise technical purity for practical considerations.
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:21:10
 &gt; Bitcoin used to be a big tent where all sorts of different innovative ideas and apps were involved to be secured by our chain. The network affect of bitcoin as being something more than money, the internet of money, is something I bought into. It's sad to give that up.
I see what you're saying, but I remember that those were more desperate times when we applauded any use case that would make the TPS rate go up. 
It took a while to realize that the future of Bitcoin is not really to be a general database, despite all the crazy hype that sold that idea to a wide audience. The truth is that a censorship-resistant blockchain is quite expensive to secure, and to compromise on censorship resistance is to call into question the entire project.
I used to be really excited too about Bitcoin as a general-purpose blockchain, but these days I'm way more excited about Bitcoin's best use case: censorship resistant money.
@_date: 2016-03-13 05:42:25
Yeah, you'd think so. A 1MB difference seems like nothing. But it turns out that it does matter on the margins, when you're talking about getting your block propagated to most of the hash power before your mining competitors beat you to it. 




Not only do larger blocks increase orphan rates, they also    make it easier for other miners to strangle you by filling up blocks to the max with spam transactions, creating a delay for you as you try to validate the entire block, when in the meantime your evil competitor has had a head start on the next block. 
I've heard people argue that miners wouldn't do that out of a shared sense of self-preservation, but I find that unconvincing. Eventually some miner will do it/has been doing it because of the profit motive, long-term consequences be damned.
We probably have no choice but to move up to 2MB due to increasing demand, however it's likely that it will add more centralization pressure, and that shouldn't be dismissed.
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:04:53
From a basic economics perspective, it's ideal. And more importantly, it solves the problem of transactions getting stuck when the system is under a spam attack.

The problem is that Classic's plan is to achieve this by implementing a controversial hard fork, which will split the community and cause major uncertainty. Core's plan is to use a soft fork, avoiding all that, and achieves an effective blocksize increase using SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:54:04
Wrong. Wrong. WRONG.
If the majority of hashing power creates blocks larger than 1MB, but the nodes operated by exchanges and business are still running Core, what do you think will happen to the miner's out-of-consensus blocks? 
I'll tell you: they will be rejected, meaning that the rogue hashpower is no longer mining Bitcoin.

That's excellent - you're one of the reasons I believe that Bitcoin has a future.
But I do wish that Core would advance the raising of the 2MB limit to sooner rather than later. That would completely dissipate the momentum behind Classic, and it would send a message to the community that you're willing to listen. It's a compromise rooted in the politics of the situation, even if you think there's little technical justification for it. The Classic guys are winning on politics.

No. Not fundamentally - they don't modify the consensus rules or process.
 BU on the other hand hands consensus over to a mining cartel of less than a dozen people. That is a subversion of Bitcoin that will turn it into PayPal.

What you think the miners would do is pure speculation. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:43:13

@_date: 2017-03-13 18:41:19

@_date: 2017-03-18 18:05:18
BU changes Bitcoin's consensus model. Instead of relying on a hardcoded blocksize limit, BU allows miners to control the blocksize. 
This introduces all sorts of problems, such as making it easy for attackers to [DOS the system and perform double-spend attacks].(
It will also probably lead to an increase in mining centralization (and it's already terrible) as large miners will have an effective tool to wipe out the competition. 
In other words, BU's Emergent Consensus is a *very bad idea*. So it doesn't make sense to run it at all, let alone in parallel with SegWit.

It would be, but the Core scaling plan is to increase the *effective* block size to 1.6MB using the Segregated Witness feature (which also solves transaction malleability), using a safer soft fork. It's a far better approach than Classic's approach, and it's happening in April.

LOL, give me a break. My eyes have nearly rolled out of their sockets, thanks.
 The debate is about **what is the safest way to increase Bitcoin's transaction capacity**. 
Most of us here have come to the conclusion that Core's SegWit solution, which uses a safe soft fork method to increase capacity, is superior to BU's solution that lets the miners change the blocksize limit according to their selfish needs whenever they want, and opens up the Bitcoin network to constant attacks that lead to devastating chain reorgs that will cause people to lose money.
BU's "emergent consensus" is a **bad** idea that will ruin Bitcoin and cause its value to plummet. It is such a bad idea that one might be excused for thinking that it's an attack by people who have an interest in Bitcoin's demise.
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:43:19

A blocksize of 20MB or 32MB would be a nuke in the mining space because it would cause miners who aren't geographically near most of the hashpower (which is currently in China) to receive blocks late and to validate them even later. Meanwhile the large miner has a head start hashing the next block. This attack is well understood and Emergent Consensus hands it to large miners on a silver platter.

The "Emergent Consensus" mechanism puts control of the blocksize in the hands of miners. Miners will of course then be incentivized to select block sizes that benefit themselves and that crush smaller miners (not to mention what it will do to the number of nodes). Emergent Consensus is the perfect mechanism for creating a mining monopoly and utterly destroying bitcoin's decentralization.

@_date: 2017-03-24 13:31:05
Here's what it would take:
The BU proponents - the people who believe that "Nakamoto Consensus" applies to chains of different protocols, who believe that miners are the most important part of Bitcoin, who believe that 4 or 5 powerful mining pool operators should control the block size, who believe in conspiracies between Blockstream and the Core open source project - would have to apply replay and wipeout protection to their software and then initiate a hard fork to a new coin.
And then we could go our separate ways.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:51:56
What you guys don't seem to understand is that "Core" isn't just the devs, it's the users. The users install and support Core. So by saying that you're trying to remove the power from Core, you're saying that you're trying to remove power from the people who install the Core software. And you know what?

The most likely scenario is that the segregated witness feature will be deployed next month, allowing for an effective 1.7x increase in block capacity. I say "allowing" because wallets must be programmed to be able to take advantage of SegWit, although I believe some are ready to do so (for example, Electrum).
Afterwards, planning for a hard fork to 2MB capacity will begin.
This is laid out in the [Capacity Increases FAQ](

But they did... SegWit even allows for up to 4MB with the right transaction mix, but 2MB in practice. They came through on the promise. It's ready to go now too, it just needs major miners to signal it.
Why the miners demand a hardfork is beyond me when it can be done safely as a softfork. There's basically no downside to the soft fork, everyone gets what they want.

BU isn't merely an alternative client implementation. There are other implementations like Knots and btcd that *don't break consensus*. BU not only breaks consensus, it cuts into to pieces and sets it on fire by implementing the totally bananas "Emergent Consensus" mechanism.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:02:51
The problem is that if the value of Bitcoin doesn't go up way higher, then there's not much of a future for the blockchain being a world-wide ledger. The whole system is dependent on the ledger units being very valuable in order to maintain the support incentives. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:42:33

Switching PoW doesn't burn it to the ground. On the contrary, it rids Bitcoin of the mining cartel, at least for a year or two. And it formalizes the power of the Economic Majority over the miners - that's a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:38:51
BU is a takover attempt staged by Roger Ver and Peter R. There is no  "compromise" with that.
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:34:16


That's not supported by the data. And just think about it: as the transaction rate rises, node operational costs increase, until only corporations can run them. 
With significant transaction growth and without restraints on layer-1, there would come a time when most nodes would be running out of datacenters by well-financed outfits, which are easy targets for regulation (few above-board businesses care to openly fight the government for obvious reasons).
That's why layer-2 and higher solutions are so critical for the future growth of the system.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:32:21
It allows for different consensus rules, so it is not Bitcoin, but an altcoin-in-waiting.

1) By not activating SegWit, a capacity increase that's ready to go.
2) By conspiring to hardfork without the support of the Economic Majority. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:51:36
Yes it is - because it's the miners who create the blocks and determine how large they actually will be. With this control, they can wipe out smaller miners by creating large blocks that keep them perpetually behind and unable to validate in time due to lack of resources. Emergent Consensus is a gift to the miners and an attack on Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:33:04
You're talking minority hashrate. But Core has the **economic majority**. Do you think that the economic majority wants to hand control of the blockchain over to miners, just because they throw 75% of their hashrate on an out-of-consensus chain? That's not how this all works.
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:39:17
 &gt;  They created an incident report for the recent bug - BUIR-2017-01-29. You can find this on google if required. A patch was quickly released.
Only after they ran out of excuses! Seriously, Roger Ver tried to argue that the invalid block was actually valid, and that it was Core that was responsible for the situation!
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:12:28
Thank you. We're obviously a bit freaked here out because BU is such a bad idea and Ver/Wu have the resources and clout to give it momentum. Personally I'm glad that you're going to list the forked chain as *not* BTC. 
I would hope that your determination of  a "clear" market signal of which chain has majority support is rigorous and takes into account things like business community and user community sentiment.

That doesn't seem reasonable to me.
 Let's say BTU lives on for a few months and it manages to become much more successful than BTC in terms of nodes and price and hashrate. It would be immoral, and practically theft, to hand the BTC ticker over to them because of an arbitrary decision that they've become dominant enough. It might even be illegal. Think of the damage that would do to BTC holders. Not a good call at all.

@_date: 2017-03-17 17:50:17
Yep, that's what Emergent Consensus does - goes against the very backbone of bitcoin's network consensus. Fortunately it's dead in the water, phew.
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:40:58
You can blame Roger and Jihan for that since they decided to block SegWit. We would be currently enjoying a 2x capacity increase right now. If users are leaving for other cryptos, it's 100% their fault.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:50:04
If the economic majority assents to the PoW change by installing the corresponding node software, then it is indeed Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is for censorship-resistant value transfers, not for storing data for someone's pet app. 
There is potentially *unlimited* demand for low-value data storage on the blockchain. Why should node operators be required to store that indefinitely? 
Bitcoin is for money. Let cheap, centralized blockchains handle app data.

@_date: 2017-03-14 02:25:11
That's nonsensical.  SegWit already includes a capacity increase to 2MB. SegWit essentially fulfills the objectives of Bitcoin Classic but without requiring a hardfork - plus fixes for transaction malleability and the quadratic-time signature hashing problem. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:39:24

"Why won't BLOCKSTREAMCORE/NORTH COREA/KIMJONGMAXWELL compromise?!?!"

Let's get this straight: The Core team didn't sign any "Hong Kong" agreement. You're talking about an agreement made by a few Core developers, representing only themselves, and some miners. They did not represent the Core development community, nor could they.

@_date: 2017-03-14 00:22:14
You're just quibbling over irrelevant details. The fact is, going by the current transaction mix, SegWit blocks would be from 1.7MB to 2MB in size. There will be more transactions packed into larger blocks. That's a block size increase.

@_date: 2017-03-24 13:36:36
Because SegWit was a compromise between the small blockers and big blockers, and now the goal posts have shifted. SegWit could be activated **right now** if the miners would stop playing politics. A hard fork to 2MB will take months to activate because of code changes, rollouts, and waiting for a block height threshold. And who's to say that a risky 2MB hardfork won't just lead to more goalpost shifting?
SegWit needs to activate first, then it will be time to focus on a hardfork.

An HF is unlikely now, unless the miners decide to stop earning money. Without the economic majority on side, BU has no chance in hell of being successful. And the looming threat of a PoW change will control Jihan's temper tantrums.

@_date: 2017-03-15 20:59:59
You're making it sound like the two teams are equivalent in size, capability, and vision. They are not. 
BU is a destructive vision of Bitcoin, one that substitutes computer-mediated consensus for human-mediated consensus -- essentially anti-consensus as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned.
And then there are serious issues with the qualifications of the team, the fact that the lead developer is deceitful (doctoring screenshots is one example), the serious concern that its main promoter is also a major altcoin investor and promoter, and I could go on.
BU doesn't deserve to be considered as a reasonable alternative to Core. We're stuck with the current consensus rules for at least  the short to medium term, so let's drop this BU nonsense and  figure out a way to move the system forward safely.
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:46:48
That doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:35:10
There's no reason to believe that at all. This is an ideological divide - it has nothing to do with hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:38:37
It's complicated: 
Good reasons to believe that it really only forked twice, and an argument can be made for once.
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:15:07
Miners work for the economic majority. If they fuck up, they're gone. There are thousands of eager GPU miners waiting to mine Bitcoin who will understand to not make threats against the economic majority. 
It is the USERS who determine Bitcoin's consensus rules, not the miners. A POW change will prove it.
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:28:26
I agree with that, which is why the POW-change threat should serve mostly as a deterrent. I hope it never needs to be used.
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:59:43
BU hasn't been adopted by the community - the economic majority runs Core. Hashpower doesn't matter if it is dedicated to an invalid, out-of-consensus chain. The community wants SegWit, and one or two powerful mining pool operators are blocking it. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:58:15
Bitcoin's primary value proposition is censorship-resistant money. Payments are a much less important consideration to this. This isn't some new idea that was conveniently invented to rationalize the capacity limits we're bumping into today - it's been long discussed within the community by passionate believers in the ideals of a money that transcends government control. Here's an excerpt from the linked interview with Amir Taaki, a productive Bitcoin software developer from earlier years.
**Aaron van Wirdum:** You don't really see Bitcoin as a payments-innovation, do you?
**Amir Taaki:** No, it's not very good for that. The Bitcoin-network is currently subsidized through inflation, meaning transactions cost about thirty dollars each. This vision of Bitcoin as a faster, cheaper and better payments-network is simply not tied to any technological grounding of what Bitcoin is really about. If we want to make Bitcoin a competitor to Visa or MasterCard, we would need to increase the blocksize and centralize mining so much that it is basically the same as existing payments networks. And even then, at some point, we'll reach a limit where Bitcoin is just not cost-efficient. **We don't need to have all these miners crunching numbers just so people can buy a coffee. That's insane.**
Edit: and I would be remiss to omit Hal Finney's famous comment from 2010 on Bitcointalk:

The banks are going to create their own Ethereum if they find it useful.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:19:34
Yes, but it's unreasonable to discount *all* of them. Certainly there's some signal in the noise. The long-term node trends suggest that the bulk of those numbers are reliable.
@_date: 2016-01-16 01:39:03
No bank will ever create a decentralized ledger that's out of their control, so that's a non-starter. 
They already have a centralized ledger under their control, so why bother creating an inefficient decentralized ledger that introduces more risk?
A true decentralized cryptocurrency can only come from an open source community project. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:27:01
Most cumulative hash power determines which chain wins out of competing chains that all follow the same consensus rules. 
When the consensus rules change, the community must support that change by updating the node software. 
The exchanges are representing that they won't change their "BTC" node from Core in the event of a contentious hard fork situation, because they believe that wouldn't be in the best interests of their users. That's a perfectly rational announcement to make and they're simply exercising their power as node operators to stay on the chain of their choosing.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:30:46

@_date: 2017-03-21 18:08:52
All that matters is how hard it would be for a bad actor to outperform the honest hash rate. 
If Bitcoin switched the work function, most of those GPU miners currently working on altcoins will have a MASSIVE incentive to switch to Bitcoin.
If most of the available mining GPUs are working on Bitcoin, I think we can assume that it's secure for the time being.
Then within a month or two there'll be FPGAs, then ASICs within a year - but at least the current mining oligopoly will have been broken up and taught a lesson.

Exchanges are on and off ramps into Bitcoin. If the exchanges don't list the Bitcoin Unlimited chain, it won't have liquidity. And without liquidity it'll have low value. 
The exchanges recently collaborated on an industry letter that said 
A) they won't list a BU forked chain unless BU implements "replay protection" (so that transactions made using BU won't replay on the original chain). BU developers still refuse to implement replay protection.
B) if exchanges do list BU, it will have the ticker symbol "BTU", not "BTC".
So it's clear that exchanges aren't going to be pushed around by BU. They're doing the correct thing and protecting their users from a miner-initiated takeover attempt. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:52:33
The problem is that a hardfork will take a year minimum to prepare and deploy, whereas SegWit is ready to go *right now* (well, within a few weeks) if the miners would simply signal their readiness. 
A capacity increase is sitting there ready to go, but AntPool won't signal for it because... it's not big enough? Because Jihan's feelings were hurt? It's maddening.

It's an actual increase. Blocks will be larger than 1 MB. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:32:30
Hashpower has no superiority over the decisions of node operators. If node operators run code that accepts 1MB blocks or smaller, there's nothing that hashpower can do about it. Even Satoshi would agree with that, since it's simply reality.
And if you think that node operators are irrelevant, ask yourself this question:
How do exchanges, businesses, and users gain access to the Bitcoin network, and how do they verify that the blockchain is following the correct rules?

"BTU" is the ticker symbol that exchanges have agreed to give to a BU chain.

Ah... this doesn't help :(
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:39:12
As said, Ethereum hasn't grown up yet, so it has yet to face the problems that Bitcoin faces. 
Some cryptocurrencies will implement some form of centralization in order to increase their TPS rate, and they'll declare that they have a superior solution to Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin's philosophy is to go for maximum censorship resistance, and any coin that wants the same will eventually encounter the same problems and tradeoffs.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:51:59
Doesn't matter. The chain would still live. Fees would go up, for sure, but transactions would still confirm within 40 minutes. Hodlers would be unaffected. Exchanges would still work just fine because of off-chain transactions. We'd tough it out, not a big deal.
Meanwhile we'd all make sure the world knew that the slower confirmation times were because of an attack by a mining cartel in China, cheered on by Roger Ver. That's the message that will win in the media.
It would be pretty stupid for the BU fork to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:28:19
BU isn't getting much love from exchanges, wallets, and businesses. Time to pack it in, boys.
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:12:04
The exchanges are sane - they recognize an attack on Bitcoin when they see one. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:24:19
That's good to hear. But why would you want to achieve that using the broken Emergent Consensus mechanism? Giving that much control to a small number miners is bad news for decentralization. 
SegWit increases the block size *and* paves the way for off-chain solutions. And it doesn it without a chain-splitting hardfork. Further, we'd be in a much better position to start planning a safe hardfork to larger blocksizes that includes basics like a block height threshold and replay protection.
What I'm saying is that if we all want on-chain and off-chain scaling, BU is probably the worst way to get to that.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:09:57

2) Obviously you CAN discuss it here. It's all we've been talking about these last several weeks.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:11:28


Wrong. Super wrong. So wrong it's ridiculous. Please educate yourselves:
The proof is in the way Core nodes work. They DO NOT ACCEPT INVALID BLOCKS. It doesn't matter how much hashpower you have. 
The only way you can force new consensus rules through is if you get the economic majority to replace their Core nodes with nodes that implement the new consensus. 
How could this not be more clear?
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:15:37
Miners won't waste their money for long on that. While they're attacking the Economic Majority chain, they can't direct that hashpower to their new altcoin. So it's not a very compelling problem to worry about.

There is a plan already underway:
[Capacity increases for the Bitcoin system](
It provides for a 1.6MB increase in the *effective* blocksize in April, using a safer method than a hard fork. 
Hardforking with Classic gets us 2MB (not much more), but with a risky contentiious hardfork maybe one month earlier.
edit: fix my numbers

@_date: 2017-03-21 03:34:27
Over 90% of nodes are Core nodes, and 22 of the most important exchanges have recently announced that they won't list BU unless they add replay protection (something BU won't do). Even then the BU chain will be listed as BTU, not BTC. That is pretty good evidence that economic majority is with Core.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:40:58
From the exchange perspective, it's not a big deal. Their trades happen on an internal database, so a slower blockchain is a just a small inconvenience for users depositing and withdrawing. It might a bigger problem for arbitrageurs, but certainly not the end of the world, and certainly worth enduring for several weeks until the difficulty adjusts. People would be understanding if the exchange explained that Bitcoin was under attack.
As a hodler, I wouldn't have to do anything but enjoy the show as the best laid plans of the attackers go awry.

Nodes are extremely important. They allow users and businesses to send and receive Bitcoin without being scammed or without being tricked into using an invalid chain.  
For example, if the mining cartel forks to a larger block size, Bitfinex will be protected from that invalid chain by its Bitcoin node. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:05:56
We need to either somehow convince Jihan Wu to signal for SegWit, or figure out how to do a user-activated soft fork.

@_date: 2017-03-19 05:01:56
It's only a minor (hah) factor because of the centralized state of mining these days. There's good evidence that one individual controls upwards of 50% of the mining hashrate.
So you have a handful of mining pool operators vs. hundreds of business node operators and thousands of individual node operators.
Unless you believe that hash power can magically force Core nodes to accept big blocks, then yes - miners are mostly irrelevant in deciding this issue.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:15:05
It's unrealistic to think that the major economic entities will install BU, not after the distrust sown by Roger Ver. He could redeem himself by campaigning for the activation of SegWit which is a capacity increase that simply waiting for miner signalling - something he can directly influence.
 I won't hold out hope that he will though, because his actions demonstrate that he's not entirely concerned about scaling.

No, the whitepaper never discussed a mining cartel taking control of the system. It mentioned 1 CPU = 1 VOTE.
 It also didn't discuss the situation where most nodes are running one set of rules, but a tiny number of mining nodes are running a different set of rules. Satoshi's whitepaper discussed the resolution of differing *in-consensus* chains using the longest-chain rule. It said *nothing* about how to settle the problem of two chains using different rules, because those are two different coins. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:40:06
Litecoin's blocks are also limited to 1MB, but the block rate is 1 block every 2.5 minutes. Litecoin is basically Bitcoin, but with 4x the block rate, 4x the coin limit, and scrypt instead of sha256 for the hashing algorithm.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:05:59
Not according to the echanges. Unless BTU gets an overwhelming majority of the nodes, which is unlikely. 
I love how BU folks talk about majority hashrate as though that's all that's needed to determine what is and isn't Bitcoin, ignoring what the users actually want.

Quite the contrary, nodes are essential to the proper functioning of the system because they validate the blocks produced by miners and they represent the economic demand of the system. if 86% of the economic majority (yes I realize you can't map it directly that way, but it's probably not too far off) wants SegWit, but the miners refuse to signal for it, then the economic majority will find a way to activate it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:48:40
Sure, miners can cause Bitcoin proper to suffer a long retargeting period, but they can't change the consensus rules. 
Judging by recent hints given by reps of major businesses like Coinbase, BitGo, BitFinex, and BitPay, it's obvious that BU will not be adopted by the economic majority. In light of that, I doubt miners would even dare to try forking to BU.

It includes a capacity increase to 2.1 MB, using the current transaction mix as a guide. It won't solve the scaling problems forever, but it buys time for no cost or risk.


That's a bizarre argument and untrue.


Over 80% of nodes have SegWit deployed. The "market" has accepted it, but the miners are reneging on their responsibility to the users by refusing to signal for it. 


It isn't just Core supporters, it's the economic majority. Most of the influential businesses in Bitcoin support SegWit. Most of the nodes are ready for SegWit. On the other hand, 23 exchanges have explicitly stated that they won't list BU as "Bitcoin", if at all. 
SegWit is well supported, I dunno where you're getting your impression that it isn't.
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:36:28
But the parts that aren't identical are a disaster. The greater point is that BU has done nothing to ensure a safe hardfork transition, making it hostile to current users - hodlers and spenders alike. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:33:40
Without the support of the economic majority, especially the exchanges, no miner is going to mine invalid blocks. Bitcoin isn't going to be killed off because BU isn't a credible threat. 
BU is now a discredited project. Peter R, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu - they've embarrassed themselves with their unprofessional and deceitful behavior. The code itself is a disaster as the two recent devastating remote hack exploits demonstrated. The Emergent Consensus model is obviously brain-dead to any Bitcoin expert who bothers to think about it for more than 10 minutes. The exchanges have made it clear that a BU chain will be an altcoin. It's over for BU.
Let's just ignore these BU idiots and figure out a way to activate SegWit without the miners. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:20:35
Nodes define the consensus rules. So a UASF in principle could work. We just rarely do them because it's safe to let miners signal their readiness. If the miners refuse to do their jobs, then we can work around them with a UASF.

@_date: 2017-03-09 22:45:13
So any SHA256 coin that receives the "majority hashrate" is Bitcoin in your estimation?
If the BU chain contains a block that's larger than 1MB, it's no longer Bitcoin, because the economic majority won't validate it as such. It doesn't matter how much hashpower it has, because the chain is an altcoin!
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:45:00
It's extremely unlikely that the economic majority will ever support BU, so that's a dead issue. If 75% of the mining hashpower wants to reduce their income by mining an altcoin, then so be it.

I know, and I get that. The problem is that the rest of the community does not :(  And given the seemingly impossible mission of trying to get everyone to understand with clarity the Core approach to scaling, I figure that it might just be prudent to say "fine - 2MB soon, then SegWit". It seems that changing that single parameter is something that people can grasp, and then they'll get off your case... for a while.

Businesses and exchanges really need to come out and publically state their preference. I know it sucks for them to have to do so, but it's the only way through this impasse.

It is so over for BU.

Majority hashrate is irrelevant when it comes to two chains that use different rules. You're thinking about how majority hashrate resolves the competition between two *valid* chains (i.e. chains that follow the consensus rules expected by the Core node software). A BU consensus-breaking hardfork will turn it into an *invalid* chain as far as Core nodes are concerned.

 &gt; if BU gets 70% in the coming weeks it will (most likely) become bitcoin whether you like it or not.
The industry letter from the exchanges clearly excludes that possibility. A hard fork to a chain with different consensus rules must include transaction replay protection in order to be listed, which BU refuses to do. And even if they do add replay protection, the BU-chain will be listed at "BTU" not the coveted "BTC".
The economic majority is running CORE nodes. Let that sink in for a second. The original client that Satoshi wrote, Core, doesn't accept blocks larger than 1MB. What do you think will happen to big blocks when they hit Bitfinex's Core node? They will be dropped. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:43:32


One exchange (Coinbase) declined to sign the letter and expressed a desire to remain "neutral".
Two exchanges (Poloniex and BitMex) officially agreed with the letter in its entirety after it was published.


Two exchanges - Kraken and Shapeshift - were initially concerned that the statement didn't include a clarification that they would consider changing the BU-chain ticker to BTC **IF** it happens to became the "dominant" chain later on. But they later made statements that they agree with the thrust of the letter: BU Will be listed as BTU, but before that they must implement replay protection.
So that's 22 exchanges that will list BU as 'BTU' if BU agrees to replay protection, and one exchange that will remain neutral (who knows how that plays out), and Gemini has declined to comment. 
That's why I think this fork threat from Jihan is just a bluff. A BU  fork doesn't have a chance of becoming Bitcoin.

An unlimited number of transactions on the base layer implies enormous block sizes (given enough demand), and only very few miners and nodes would be able to handle that. Most businesses and exchanges would likely subscribe to a node service, and there'd probably only be 2 or 3 mining pools/companies, if even that many.
With so few independent nodes, they're easy centralized targets for government regulation, which would turn Bitcoin into an inefficient and pointless version of Paypal.

Not really. There are those of us who don't agree with the very idea of Classic - that the developer's mechanism for reaching consensus on what gets committed can be subverted by populist tactics. That's a game-changer for Bitcoin, and I and many others want nothing to do with it. Bitcoin Core will be its own coin (in fact, we'll still call it "Bitcoin"). There'll be plenty of nodes (in fact, most of the nodes) and  a large enough chunk of the ecosystem that it'll still be viable on its own.

Let's say a miner makes an "important decision" and creates a large block, larger than 1MB. This large block then arrives at a Core node owned by, let's say, Bitfinex - one of the most (if not *the* most) important Bitcoin exchanges.
What will happen to that large block? What will happen when it hits other Core nodes, run by other important businesses? What will happen when it hits the nodes of regular users, 93% of whom are running Core?

Blockstream has little to do with the Core client, despite the feverish conspiracy theories from fanatics.
BU is trying (and failing miserably) to build a replacement for the core client that it controls, governed under an "Articles of Confederation" (I wish I was kidding), with a President and everything. It's a quasi-corporation.
In contrast, the Core open source project is run by a bunch of volunteers who use a consensus model for governance.

Moderation != censorship.
Imagine a meeting room where people are sitting around a table trying to have an in-depth debate about a complex technical subject.
Then dozens of people with only a cursory understanding of the subject burst into the the room and start shouting falsehoods and half-truths, drowning out the voices of the experts, and they don't stop, arguing tenaciously and refusing to listen.

93% of nodes run Core. 80% are SegWit nodes. 23 exchanges (21 signed a letter, 2 made their own announcements) have said that they won't even list BU unless it has replay protection, and even then it'll be BTU not BTC. Look at the reaction in social media... it's pretty obvious that BU is now more or less the butt of jokes. It's not seen as a viable node candidate, and won't be for quite some time if ever.
The weight of evidence for who supports BU and who supports Core suggests that it is *you* who needs to consider if you might be wrong.

You're right, node count isn't an accurate signifier because of sybils. But that doesn't mean that you can discount them completely, unless you believe that nearly node every node is a sybil. 
I don't dismiss people who've invested in Bitcoin, but it's hard to sample them. 
I do believe that 23 exchanges coming out with statements that a contentious BU hardfork will be listed as "BTU" and not "BTC" is a strong bit of *evidence* that the business community in its entirety (not just exchanges) would rather remain with the status quo than take the risk of supporting a highly contentious forked chain, at least not while calling it "Bitcoin."

This is a super lame reason (let's not endeavor to do a safe soft fork because it's *hard*... wtf?!), and not true anyways. 
Hard forks, *especially* when they're contentious, lead to chain splits which are economically damaging to the system as a whole. Further, hard forks require careful preparation: activation thresholds, replay protection, and wipeout protection. So hard forks are neither simpler nor cleaner to implement at all!

We shall see! I'd rather Bitcoin do one thing, and do it *extremely well*: censorship-resistant money. To be that, it has to optimize for decentralization. A money network that is maximally decentralized will not have a high TPS rate at the base layer.
Let's let the Ethereums and Dashes try the other use cases. They're going to run into storage and capacity problems eventually, and they will face the same problem - that transaction capacity and decentralization are **fundamentally** in tension. 
ETH and DASH will have to decide where on that spectrum they will sit, and that will cause their communities to fracture as well into different ideological camps. And then critics and the disaffected will declare that other cryptos are going to eat their lunch, etc.

It's a risk, but it's not insurmountable. It the miners start censoring transactions, then the economic majority of node operators can switch the work function, effectively firing the SHA256 miners in favor GPU miners (and that community is gigantic). 
This is why nodes are *extremely important* (and as many as possible) - by serving as the gateways through which users transact with the Bitcoin network, they ensure that miners are producing valid blocks by rejecting invalid blocks, that miners continue to serve the interests of the users. Nodes and users establish bitcoin's value and exchange price, and as history proves, hashrate follows price.

As block sizes rise, it becomes more expensive to run a full node, and that unavoidably leads to fewer nodes, which increases centralization.

@_date: 2017-08-22 17:40:42
A large number of users are holding the tokens because they're sound money. For instance, I only need to make a transaction 2-3 times per year, and I wouldn't care if the fees were $50.
 I'm willing to pay the fees because Bitcoin is censorship-resistant and inflation-resistant. Those properties are expensive to maintain because they require decentralization. The need for decentralization favors small blocks. Small blocks drive up fees. 
In effect, high fees are the necessary cost of maintaining a censorship-resistant value storage and transfer system on the Internet.

I completely agree. There's a war going on now between those who believe that Bitcoin should become a valuable commodity before it can be a useful payment network, and those who believe the opposite. 
But we know from 8 years of operation that Bitcoin is just not compelling as a payment solution akin to the Visa network.

That's a ridiculous false equivalence.

It's entirely the point. The only reason for Bitcoin to exist is for censorship resistance. It's about monetary sovereignty, not cheap payments. 
The people who've promoted Bitcoin as a competitor to PayPal or Visa never understood why Bitcoin was valuable in the first place. 
If you want cheap payments, wait for 2nd layer solutions such as lightning. The base layer must have its censorship resistance preserved at all costs, and that requires decentralization, and that is bloody expensive.

Yes, sad, since SegWit is an amazing protocol upgrade for the system. It eliminates transaction malleability, provides for at least a 1.7x capacity increase (and probably more than 2x in practice), and it paves the way for 2nd layer tech like the Lightning Network.

In the event of a permanent fork with two separate and incompatible Bitcoin Networks, the Trust, Gemini Exchange and the Custodian will elect to support the Bitcoin Network with the greatest cumulative computational difficulty in order to engage in bitcoin transactions and the valuation of bitcoin. 
They're taking on unnecessary risk with that approach. It would be safer for them to commit to siding with the chain chosen by the economic majority. They could list the top 20 exchanges and services in bitcoin, and state that they will side with what the majority of those businesses choose. They would have to update that list annually. That would be much less of a gamble than a simple look at hash power.

Everyone agrees that we need bigger blocks. The problem with the 2X effort is that it involved very little community input and no (that's correct: none) developer input. Its only developer (Jeff Garzik) also happens to work on an ICO that profits from contentious cryptocurrency hard forks - a significant conflict of interest. The hard fork date is widely considered to be rushed and incredibly reckless. It's a total shit show.
A proper capacity increase will require broad consensus with input from the entire community: users, developers, businesses, and miners. Anything less is contentious and doomed to split the chain.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:54:20
I'll try to provide some context:
SegWit is an advanced transaction type that is cheaper to send than a standard transaction type. 
The code that implements SegWit was deployed to over 90% of Bitcoin nodes (by way of node operators installing the updated Core software) by late last year. The node software wouldn't activate SegWit until it could see that 95% of recent blocks being created by miners contained a special SegWit activation string.
This signaling threshold was finally achieved (after protracted and bitter community in-fighting) this past summer, and now all Core nodes will recognize and process the SegWit transaction type.
The problem is that wallet providers such as Coinbase haven't changed their custom wallet code to *create* the new SegWit transaction type. They're only capable of creating expensive standard transactions. They had well over a year to build SegWit capability into their service, but they haven't done it, possibly for political reasons (they prefer a simpler but more dangerous approach to scaling). 
Whatever their reasons, Coinbase's failure to utilize the SegWit transaction type is making transactions very expensive for their customers.
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:38:27
The problem is that "we the people" might be half of the community/businesses/hash power, creating uncertainty as to which chain will prevail as the "true" Bitcoin, and that could cause a damaging loss of confidence in Bitcoin.

SegWit lowers fees and improves the odds of your transaction getting confirmed in the next block, so in that respect it can help confirmation speed. Otherwise is doesn't change the Bitcoin block (and thus confirmation) rate of 1 every 10 minutes. That's pretty much set in stone - changing it would require a hard fork following a lengthy community consensus-building process.
There's a lot of debate over the ideal block rate - many Bitcoin devs feel that 1 every 10 minutes efficiently minimizes the [block orphan rate]( which minimizes miner losses (and wasted energy). So lowering the blockrate comes with tradeoffs, and that rarely ever gets mentioned by competing altcoins.
Second layer solutions such as Lightning Network (LN) do promise to allow for very high tps rates with near-instant confirmations.

The main concern has nothing to due with HD space, it has to do with  block transmission times.

Saying that it's "faster" is misleading. Blocks are generated at 4 times the Bitcoin rate, which comes with its own disadvantages, such as higher orphan rates as block sizes increase. 
Additionally, Litecoin's implementation of scrypt uses the default parameters, meaning that it's not as nearly memory-intensive as it should have been. Not that it matters all that much - the hashing algorithm is just a way to force miners to prove that they've expended energy. It matters little what the algorithm is, as long as it's a one-way function that's hard to calculate and easy to verify. Litecoin's claim to fame was that its scrypt implementation would be ASIC-resistant, a goal that it failed to achieve.

SegWit directly addresses the blocksize issue by providing an immediate boost to the blocksize (estimates are 2.1 MB) for near-term relief, and by providing the foundations for long-term 2nd-layer scaling.
The reasons for opposing SegWit have been irrational and incomprehensible. But with this ASICBOOST revelation, we finally know the true reason for the opposition.

You need to pay attention to what the major economic nodes are saying. 
[This exchange industry statement]( for example, makes it clear that a BU fork can not compete directly with Bitcoin as a rival. Without exchange support, it's pretty much impossible.

The hits to the project's credibility resulting from the two remote crash exploits and from the zaniness of its chief promoter are also fatal blows.

Satoshi would have to be crazy to have not sold even some of those coins when the price skyrocketed past $10 (an unlikely outcome that probably even took Satoshi by surprise). The fact that none of those coins have moved, even when the price hit $1000, is good evidence that they never will.

SegWit includes a real, bonafide, actual, motherfucking blocksize increase. A block packed with SegWit transactions could in principle be up to 4MB in size, but in practice is expected to be 2.1MB in size on average. Not "effectively" - **actual** size. 
If you counted all the bytes of a loaded SegWit block, they will exceed 1 million bytes. Not in separate blocks, not using compression - the actual block that contains *both the commitments and the witnesses* will exceed 1 million bytes.

Accelerating demand is crashing hard into a supply that is essentially fixed (1800 new bitcoins are added each day, but 79% of all bitcoins that will ever be in circulation have already been mined).

Buying and holding Bitcoin has been an amazing bet since 2009. The market corrected 38% during June and then went to an all-time high near $5k. This is yet another correction. 
There have been dozens of big corrections in Bitcoins price history. There's no good reason to believe that this current correction is somehow special or any worse or more final than all the previous ones.
China has "banned Bitcoin" several times in the past. They even halted withdrawals on all Chinese exchanges last year, a ban that went on for many months. During that time, the price rose!

Jimmy Song asked Alex Petrov (of BitFury) which chain they'll mine if there's a 2X hardfork. Petrov responded that the NYA was premised on there being one chain after the hardfork, and if that doesn't end up being the case,  then he doesn't feel that they need to follow that agreement. Therefore he's not going to commit to mining one chain or the other.
This is logical - miners are strongly incentivized to mine the most valuable chain. If the 2X hardfork fizzles as it appears it's going to, there will be NYA miners who quickly defect away from the 2X chain and back to the normal chain.

The bandwidth demands that 300GB will place on your home connection are prohibitive for a significant percentage of the population. Also, downloading and verifying that 300GB is *extremely* CPU and I/O intensive - i.e., the computer is practically unusable for days (or weeks) while setting up a full Ethereum node.
The size of the blockchain inversely correlates with the number of nodes that will run to support it. Too large, too soon = centralization pressure. A cryptocurrency without decentralization is pointless.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:55:58
There's a right way and a wrong way. The way leads to centralization and the death of Bitcoin, or at least the relegation of it to a Rube Golberg form of PayPal. Non-technical business CEOs think this is the way to go, possibly because they don't understand the long-term implications, or maybe because they don't care.
The way is strongly committed to censorship resistance by way of preserving decentralization. All the best and developers and computer scientists in this space are aligned with this vision.
The two paths forward lead to radically different outcomes, so it's disingenuous to pretend that it's just a matter of disagreement over essentially the same thing. This is a fight for survival.

They're saying that they'll assign "BTC" to the B2X chain if it gains the "most accumulated difficulty."

@_date: 2017-10-25 08:54:14
They're using the euphemism "most accumulated difficulty", which means only one thing: they will let the miners decide which chain wins.
They're saying this because they're obviously confident that they've locked up well over 51% of the hashrate for at least 48 hours, even if the miners have to lose money for that period (Coinbase and Gemini are perhaps covering the loss).

Coinbase, on the other hand, WILL GO OUT OF ITS WAY to assign the BTC ticker symbol to an invalid chain by installing the btc1 software. It's dishonest, it's arbitrary, it's self-serving, and it's fraud.
Coinbase is going to expose its customers to confusion and financial loss, because its founders can't handle the reference client being run by an opensource community of volunteers. They and their conspirators want control.

Not true. If the current chain (there's no "1X" chain - please stop that) retains the most value as the futures markets predict, then miners will be heavily incentivized to defect back to the original chain.
Also consider this: most of Bitcoin's value is controlled by holders. We don't need a transaction rate to continue holding. Also consider that the vast majority of Bitcoin's transactions happen on exchanges and other off-chain platforms. Bitcoin can endure a low block rate for a very long time.

They're saying the chain with "most accumulated difficulty" will become Bitcoin. They don't give any time frames, and they don't specify any other metric in such hard terms.
Since over 80% of the hashrate is controlled by mining pool operators who are NYA signatories, Coinbase must feel strongly that the miners will follow through on the agreement and mine the 2X chain for several days, regardless of losses. This is why they chose the specific terminology "most accumulated difficulty", and not "community consensus" or "a poll of our users."
If they were trying to protect their customers, the most logical choice is the one they made on Monday: The current chain remains Bitcoin, no matter what. Coinbase's Core node will ensure that  - they don't have to do anything but let it reject incompatible blocks as it's designed to do. 
Instead, they went out of their way to clarify the statement (somebody must have gotten slapped around at the Coinbase office) with "most accumulated difficulty" which is a euphemism for "the fix is in: we choose B2X."

It's an obvious propaganda technique. Clever, but slimy and inaccurate: the Bitcoin chain is actually 1.5X and will grow to around 2.1X as SegWit adoption continues to accelerate.


This doesn't make any sense at all. It's clear that current chain is being valued at six times the 2X chain according to three separate futures markets. If that holds, then the longer the miners stay on the 2X chain, the more money they will lose - to the tune of millions per day. There will be defectors before long. The speed of coin transfer is irrelevant - that can be done off-chain, or via other commitments. 


Bitcoin has enough holders and off-chain capacity to buffer over temporary drops in transaction capacity. Faith will be shaken more when the public realizes that a couple dozen CEOs can seize control of a cryptocurrency. That's what will make headlines.

It can't be all those things at the base layer, but it can be those things in multiple layers (as demonstrated with remarkable success by the Internet protocol stack).

Hardforking would be contentious, because a good portion of the community wants to see protocol efficiency improvements before the blocksize limit is raised. 
Raising the blocksize to 4MB before SegWit is activated would be dangerous, because of the quadratic relationship between block verification time and signature operations. SegWit makes that relationship linear, which is why it must be activated first.
More information here: 
A contentious hard fork would split the network into two coins. My guess is that most nodes would continue on with Core, but there would probably be one or two major exchanges/businesses that switch to the breakaway client. The value and reputation of both coins would be damaged.
Sensible, smart scaling in the form of SegWit is already deployed in the code and waiting for activation. It would be foolish for a large mining concern to block it for the irrational desire to replace it with an inferior solution (changing the blocksize limit parameter).

Nobody is against bigger blocks - that's a strawman argument. 
SegWit is a rough doubling of blocksize capacity, and it's been deployed to nearly all nodes and available for activation since December, yet the miners refused to activate it for questionable political motives. They obviously weren't too concerned about fees.
But regardless, everyone agrees that future blocksize increases will be necessary, but the issue is *how much* and *when*. Even 2MB blocks will *necessarily decrease the number of nodes*, which is a hit against centralization. The only reason for Bitcoin to exist, after all, is to be decentralized censorship-resistant money. 
It is therefore paramount that we balance the fundamental tension between system capacity and censorship resistance. That means that we must scale in careful steps, evaluating the effects of each change along the way.
SegWit is a beautiful solution because it solves a number of critical problems in one go: it doubles transaction capacity, it solves malleability which paves the way for more practical 2nd layer transaction caching/payment channel solutions, it solves the quadratic-time signature validation issue, and it disincentivizes UTXO spam.
SegWit provides a strong foundation for future blocksize increases, which *nearly everyone expects will be necessary*. But it would be foolish to go too far too soon. Slow and steady wins the race.
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:59:06
The fact remains that the vast majority of users want SegWit, and only a tiny minority of mining pool operators (literally &lt; 10 *individuals*) have been blockading it for political reasons.

The NYA activates SegWit (an all nodes) via the BIP91 -&gt; BIP9 path. It requires only the miners to install special software to do this. 
*If* the miners follow through on this, then we have nothing to worry about, because SegWit gets activated and then we can ignore the 'btc1' project.
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:22:00
Why not? If BIP148 fails, then Bitcoin will have been  commandeered by a mining and business cartel. That's the beginning of the end of censorship resistance and puts Bitcoin on track to become a regulated (and really inefficient) payment network. 
Many of us aren't in Bitcoin to watch it become a crummy version of PayPal. We're in it for censorship resistance.

The thing is, Core didn't balk at a 2MB blocksize - they created SegWit, which compromised between the keep-blocks-small-and-nimble crowd and the add-more-capacity crowd. 
For reasons I can't understand, a bunch of people on the big block side of the debate - people who wanted 2MB blocks - never believed that. But here we are, about to get an increase to 2MB blocks *without requiring a hard fork*.
@_date: 2016-05-22 21:38:08

@_date: 2017-07-19 17:28:37
The 2X HF  (it's not 2MB - the HF doubles the blocksize capacity, hence the 2X) is not happening. Too much of the community **hates** it. I suspect even many of the NYA participants are by now changing their minds due to the incompetence of the btc1 team.
And you really are out of touch (or have been listening the the wrong people, which I suspect is the case) if you believe that Bitcoin hasn't moved forward in the past two years.
Aside from three soft forks (BIP 66 - 2015-07-04, BIP 65  - 2015-12-08, BIP 68/12/113 - 2016-07-04), The Core software is constantly being tweaked to reduce node resource requirements, helping to keep the system decentralized:

SegWit already includes a blocksize increase to 2MB. SegWit was a compromise between big blockers and small blockers, then the goalposts mysteriously shifted, so talk of a new "compromise" before the first compromise gets implemented is ridiculous.
 SegWit is the foundation for all future scaling - it needs to happen first before talk of future improvements can be taken seriously.

@_date: 2017-07-13 00:10:49
You don't understand. Users have *already approved* SegWit. It's deployed to over 90% of the nodes. The only reason it isn't active right now is because the miners are refusing (for political and selfish reasons) to signal their readiness under the BIP-9 activation mechanism. BIP-9 was intended as the safest possibly way to activate a soft fork, not as a way to give miners a vote on soft fork upgrades. 
Most soft forks were done the UASF way. BIP-148 is merely continuing this tradition. 
BIP-148 isn't users acting like children, it's users activating a feature that's been deployed for 8 months!

The only reason they're not directly signaling 141 is to pretend that they have some control over the matter -- to save face.

@_date: 2017-07-19 19:16:23
We'll have to see what happens after SegWit. Currently we have enough capacity to balance the need for volume against the need for centralization. SegWit roughly doubles that.
It would be foolish to rush  to double that *again* within three months without watching to see what happens with SegWit. This is because each increase in block size will necessarily decrease the number of nodes due to rising operating costs.

My point being that all this adulation being given to "SegWit2x" is misplaced bordering on ridiculous.

Or, the miners realize that the economic majority won't switch to their coercive hard fork and are willing to wait out the difficulty readjustment. Then a few miners start to defect back to the real chain because the one they're mining is worthless, and then a few more return, the hashrate picks up, more miners come back, and then the  it's over. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:36:18
The miners have agreed to put a signal in their blocks before August 1st that will trigger the activation of a set of improvements called "SegWit" that are already deployed to the vast majority of Bitcoin nodes, ready for activation, and have been since late last year. 
The miners had agreed to activate SegWit much earlier by common agreement, but politics and self-interest got in the way and they stalled signalling.
To counter the signal stalling, a contingent of users came up with a method to activate SegWit: BIP148, which is a user-activated soft fork (UASF). UASF is the old way of activating protocol upgrades that doesn't rely on miners signalling their readiness to upgrade. BIP148 says that come August 1st, participating nodes will reject blocks from miners that don't support SegWit. 
The miners saw this revolt coming and make a big showy deal of pretending to come on board with SegWit called the "New York Agreement" (NYA): They will activate SegWit using an unnecessarily complicated signalling method, and then three months after activation, they will implement a hard fork that will arbitrarily *double* (2x) the block size capacity on top of the doubling that SegWit already implements.
This "2x" increase is widely seen by a majority of Bitcoin Core contributors as reckless and dangerous because it foolishly adjusts the consensus parameters soon after a major protocol upgrade, it would be implemented using hastily written code that's developed in secret (despite their public GitHub repo which looks to be just for appearances), and would necessitate a dangerous chain-splitting hard fork due to its highly controversial nature.
**So what will happen?**
On August 1st, we will get SegWit. Yay! No chain split is expected then.
Three months later, the miners *might* attempt to continue with the 2x hardfork plan, but it's highly doubtful that they will. *Why*? because unless the rest of the community has upgraded to the 2x node software by that point, the miners wouldn't dare to start mining larger blocks, since the nodes would reject them - meaning, the miners would be mining an altcoin. Miners cannot change the consensus rules without the participation of the *economic majority* of nodes. 
*What do we have to do as concerned users?*
You could install a BIP148 node and use that as your principal way of making Bitcoin transactions. This will help to ensure that the miners keep their word and activate SegWit by August. Or you could do nothing. There's a good chance that the miners will activate SegWit regardless.
As far as SegWit2x goes: don't install the 2X software and tell your exchange and favorite Bitcoin businesses that you're concerned about dangerous hasty hardforks and that you want them to IGNORE SegWit2X.

There are plenty of political tools to do so - a technical attack isn't even required. Here's a scenario:
A UN treaty called "Single Convention on Virtual Currencies" is ratified. It requires that participating nations ban unapproved digital value-transfer mechanisms for general economic use. This drives cryptocurrencies underground, where liquidity is pitifully low. This will kill off nearly all speculative cryptocurrencies (i.e. 99% of cryptocurrencies).
The only cryptocurrencies that will survive that kind of attack will be the ones that have strong network effects and that are truly lightweight and decentralized - i.e., anyone can run a node on cheap equipment, anywhere.
Cryptocurrencies that depend on expensive "master nodes" that need to run in data centers will be easily shut down.

Miners do have some power, certainly, but it's not absolute. They can potentially collude to reorganize recent blocks. They can potentially collude to double-spend. But they can't steal anyone's bitcoins. And they cannot unilaterally hard fork without the rest of the community upgrading their nodes.

It's too bad, because that's an illogical requirement. SegWit is ready to go *right now* (ignoring the lock-in period) with a 2.1x increase, whereas a hard fork will take many months to test and deploy -
 and worse, a hard fork at this point remains highly contentious, so it's likely to fail and lead to a permanent chain split.
Delaying SegWit for a hardfork is insane. Everyone's complaining about high fees -- the immediate solution is SegWit. A hard fork for more capacity can  be planned later.

But Andresen/Ver/Matonis believe it! It's like they've all been replaced by aliens. Or maybe they were always stupid and we refused to see it.

The miners won't hard fork until they see that the major economic nodes have installed SegWit2x (otherwise they would be mining a worthless altcoin). It's doubtful that major exchanges like Bitfinex and Poloniex, who have traditionally been pro-Core, would be bullied into installing SegWit2X.

The question is: why would it? All of the just-so stories spun by LN detractors about the inevitability of a small number of Lightning hubs are pure conjecture.
Besides, if you fear that the Lightning Network will inevitably lead to a few dominant Lightning hubs, then you don't have to use the Lightning Network, because it's a 2nd layer *optional* payment network. There will be other 2nd layer payment networks that you'll be able to try out.
 SegWit paves the way for any number of higher layer payment solutions, most of which will probably fail, but a few of which will succeed brilliantly. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:35:21
The miners will be compelled to switch given the incentives. Anyway it doesn't matter - the miners have promised to activate SegWit by August 1st, right? So if they're honest, then there's nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:08:40
Some of us expect a chunk of the hashrate to go back on their word. BIP-148 ensures that SegWit gets activated.
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:58:00
BIP 148 didn't propose a hard fork - it is a mechanism to activate SegWit, the soft fork upgrade that had been deployed to over 90% of nodes for over half a year. 
BIP 148 was required because the mining pools refused to do their jobs and activate it.
Were it not for BIP 148 forcing the issue, the same people who blockaded SegWit activation would not have caved in and agreed to activate it using BIP 91. 
So really - it's a little rich to thank the same people who *prevented SegWit from activating* for finally activating it only after it became clear that the community was going to route around them.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:47:07
The SegWit part is fine. The 2X part is controversial, so that's not happening, no matter how much hashrate is behind it.

@_date: 2017-06-20 03:37:52
They can't turn it off, because all the Core nodes will have locked in "on". If the community then later refuses to install the NYA/SegWit2x node software, there isn't very much the miners can do about that other than threaten to hard fork to 2MB. A hard fork threat is toothless, however, if they don't have a substantial number of business nodes on their side.
So why don't they just signal bit 1? Politics. There's no rational technical explanation. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:16:47

Another scenario is that most of the economic nodes won't switch from Core, forcing the miners to abandon SegWit2X. That's pretty much what's happened with all the other fork attempts - why would it be different this time?

That violated *censorship-resistance* to bail out some of the founders who lost a ton of money on a bad contract. Ethereum will never live that down. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:10:12
The only reason for a cryptocurrency to *exist* is censorship resistance. That is the only value proposition for blockchains in general. Otherwise, why bother with such an inefficient, Rube Goldberg database? 
Ethereum violated its primary value proposition - its promise to the community that it would run "[unstoppable applications]( and that "code is law." 
[More info here](
Once you go down the road of forking the chain to compensate holders of an unpleasant contract outcome, you've lost all integrity. Ethereum Classic is the original chain that still retains its integrity - the DAO contract outcome was allowed to continue according to the rules of the system that everyone signed up for. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:44:18
No - that was a bug in the client implementation (the bitcoin protocol doesn't allow more than 21M coins to exist) that required an obvious and uncontroversial fix. 
On the other hand, the DAO contract was *perfectly valid code* according to the "code is law!" nutcases from Slockit. This code-is-law contract contained a re-entrancy bug that allowed ETH to be drained from it by a perfectly valid transaction.  
Note that the Ethereum platform itself also functioned perfectly - the DAO exploit didn't involve any bugs in Ethereum at all, just the crummy DAO contract. 
If that happened in Bitcoinland, it would have been a Mt. Gox-style disaster, but the community would never have supported a hard fork to make the contract owners whole again. That would violate the principle of censorship-resistance - the very philosophical foundation of a cryptocurrency that gives it a reason to exist.
But not in Ethereumland! It has a central figure with enough political power to overcome that annoying hurdle. And so He and the Foundation pushed for a hard fork that handed the DAO attacker's ETH back to its previous owners. And in doing so, they violated the Ethereum community promise of censorship resistance. That *never* happened in Bitcoin.

The proposed 2x increase (doubling of the maximum possible block size from 4MB to 8MB, hence the "2x") will necessarily reduce the number of full nodes on the network due to the increased operating costs, mostly in terms of monthly bandwidth charges. 
Many developers (perhaps most) feel that it would be prudent to wait and see what happens to the network after SegWit is deployed, which will roughly double the block size (to 2.1 or 2.2MB on average, 4MB maximum theoretical). 
To double that automatically without consideration to real-world effects on node count and miner behavior (larger blocks make it easier for large miners to snuff out the competition) is seen as reckless.

"What is more important? You having a copy of the blockchain, or you having money that no one can manipulate?"

There'll be no divorce either. Bitmain and ViaBTC are issuing impotent threats. They don't have the economic majority on their side.

No, he's wrong - SegWit is a blocksize increase. SegWit blocks will be larger (approx 2MB on average, 4MB max). If you watch the block enter your node using a packet analyzer, you will count more than 2 million bytes for the average block.

It didn't have majority support... that was never conclusively established. It was quickly railroaded through by a committee of Foundation members, DAO founders, and exchange operators (the latter of whom were mostly taken offguard and deferred to following advice from Vitalik). It hardly went through and serious review process at all.
The hard fork to forcefully remove funds from the DAO attacker was a blatant violation of Ethereum's community promise. The contracts could, in fact be stopped. The code did, in fact, care. 
Ethereum crossed the Rubicon with that violation and can never go back. That taint will stick to Ethereum until its inevitable final form as a centralized database.

If the miners activate SegWit, then BIP 148 has no net effect. There won't be a split.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:09:34
The proposed SegWit2X signalling method activates the existing installed base of SegWit that's deployed to the vast majority of nodes.
 Only the miners need to install the SegWit2X code, which is being maintained as a separate codebase (project 'btc1' on GitHub) by a different group of people, in order to proceed with their unnecessarily complicated signalling method.
The challenge for NYA supporters will be to get the rest of the community to install the SegWit2X software in order to proceed with the *2X* part of the plan. There's nothing forcing anyone to install that software, so the 2X part seems iffy at best.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:43:23
It is trivially false. Core nodes will not accept out-of-consensus blocks from miners, and the vast majority of economic nodes run Core. 
If miners could change the rules through mere hashpower, Bitcoin would now be "Bitcoin Unlimited" under the rules of Emergent Consensus.
And regarding the whitepaper - Satoshi programmed the client software to ignore blocks that don't follow the rules that it understands, regardless of hashpower. Satoshi's implementation breaks anyone's misinterpretation of his whitepaper.

Some investments are scams or without merit, and cryptoland is filled with them. 
Ethereum is a centrally-controlled smart contract platform (although not necessary technically true, it's effectively true owing to the considerable political clout wielded by the Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin) that has dubious long-term utility (there are few rational use cases for managing real-world things using a blockchain), serious scaling issues (every node has to run every contract), and potentially unbounded security vulnerabilities (a consequence of Ethereum's virtual machine attack surface). 
And then there's the glaring problem that Ethereum violated its community promise of providing a platform where contracts would be run without interference ("contracts that can't be stopped" and "code that can't care"). They did this by modifying the outcome of a contract (the DAO) that had an unfavorable effect on the wealth of Ethereum Foundation members, by pushing through a very hasty hard fork on the community. Up until that point, their chant was "code is law", but when the improperly written code was exploited in an unpleasant way, it was suddenly no longer law.
Bitcoin has never violated its community promise - it is censorship resistant and always has been (Bitcoiners didn't even consider for one second to bail out the  the Mt. Gox depositors). Bitcoin's founder disappeared so there's no Bitcoin prophet who can railroad through changes on the force of his beatific glow. 
Bitcoin is an actual cryptocurrency, Ethereum is on track to become a smart contracts platform run by a consortium.

Ethereum's price runup is mostly due to the ICO craze (you have to buy ETH to get into most ICO presales). 
ICOs are essentially IPOs by another name: an unregistered security is offered to the public but without any oversight whatsoever. For example, Bancor just raised $150M (in a few hours!) on nothing more than a business plan, and there's nothing stopping the founders from blowing it all on coke and whores and yachts. 
Imagine getting millions of dollars up front for weak promises of future delivery that you don't actually have to keep. There will be many scams.
Eventually a scam will be Too Big to Ignore, and the regulators (SEC in the US) will start making arrests and lawmakers will crack down. That will collapse the entire ETH/ICO house of cards, and the price will plummet.

It's baffling to me as well. Both sides can have what they want if layer 1 is preserved as a maximally-decentralized and censorship-resistant chain, and higher layers are used for low-fee payment channels.
And if businesses are willing to sacrifice some censorship-resistance for faster confirmations and lower fees (as they clearly seem to be), then federated side chains seem like an ideal solution.
I don't get why the big block side has fetishised scaling on layer 1. They just want to throw more cylinders on the engine because it's easy to understand - but it's foolish.

Circle pivoted away from Bitcoin at the absolute worst time - they're missing out on this tidal wave of new interest. Without Bitcoin, they're just an also-ran against Square. Too bad for them.

SegWit includes a blocksize increase of roughly 2.1MB. It's nonsensical to further expand the space by changing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE, especially since that requires a highly contentious hard fork.
The right path forward is to execute SegWit immediately (all the miners have to do is signal for it in their blocks). Then we see what happens, then we plan a hard fork that the community can agree on.

Actually it was Charlie Munger who said that.

The fact is that a safe and widely lauded scaling solution (not the end-all be-all solution, but an important step forward) has been coded, extensively tested, and deployed to over 90% of the nodes, and has been waiting for activation by the miners as per BIP 9 *for several months*.
The current high fees are entirely due to the stonewalling and blockading efforts of Jihan Wu and Roger Ver and their associates. One must conclude that *they're the ones who actually want high fees.*

No, there's not.

Was the May backlog manufactured?
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:12:26
Probably something disappointing.

Immutability is also a cultural value of a cryptocurrency's community. If immutability is not valued, then a hardfork to modify the ledger is possible (like what's happening in Ethereum). Without immutability, the remaining justifications for cryptocurrency are dubious.

Not that I don't want it to be true, but this claim is from a rinky-dink investment advisor looking at its own clients, so take it with a building-sized grain of salt.

Coinbase wishes that Ethereum was the top coin, and they act accordingly.
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:42:08
Yeah sure. Nobody expected Bitcoin to be able to take over *today*. It's a silly criticism to say that Bitcoin isn't ready when it's barely out of diapers.

The odds are strong that there will not be a chain split.

ETH is a house of cards. It's not an enemy, but when it collapses 80% after the coming ICO crackdown (ICOs are essentially unregistered securities and no better than most penny stock scams), Bitcoin will bear some of the resulting backlash against cryptocurrency. Similar when it's widely realized that there are scant few uses for "blockchain technology" aside from cryptocurrency and some extremely basic non-cryptocurrency use cases.

Core is an open software development project. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:27:50
SegWit, which provides a capacity increase and a foundation for 2nd layer scaling, is deployed to 95% of the active Bitcoin nodes. The  Core open source community wrote that (NOT Blockstream), and it's been ready since last year.
 It is Roger Ver and his cancerous, technically ignorant disinformation campaign that has caused miners to not signal their readiness for SegWit. Roger and his idiot army (some of whom are essentially paid goons) are responsible for the lack of scaling.
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:04:32
None of that fantasy will happen, because the miners aren't going to abandon the chain that is in use by most of the nodes in the ecosystem, unless they want to lose a shit ton of money. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:19:44
Bitcoin is an open system -- a community platform for storing and transferring value on the Internet. It is entirely appropriate for its technical path to be guided by a community that follows an open source development model. The development community did an excellent job of creating an elegant and safe scaling improvement that benefits all Bitcoin users.
Bitcoin is NOT a product that requires making compromises for "key stakeholders". The platform needs to be as close to ideal as possible. Making compromises for the sake of politics would ruin the system.

Eric goes on to say that he feels the project was "hijacked in a bait-and-switch."
It really does seem that way. If the miners actually  support SegWit as they loudly claim to, then all they have to do is signal for BIP 141 and we could have 2.1x scaling with a few weeks. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:54:10
Yes, and that's a good thing because it plays a key role in preserving censorship resistance, which is the whole point of cryptocurrency. Letting politics sway technical decisions is a corruption of that purpose.
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:33:26
The scaling war exists because some bitcoiners refuse to believe this, even though layered networking is fundamental to why the Internet became such a success.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:17:21
The crowd have been going bananas here lately, along with a ton of new accounts that spew the same anti-Segwit anti-Core talking points.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:33:40
Nobody has to switch to SegWit2x. Only the miners participating in this silly and pointless agreement do. They'll signal on bit 1 of the BIP 9 version bits, which is what 95% of the deployed nodes are looking for. That will activate SegWit. Then we ignore them. Done.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:06:33
And I will. So, uh, so there!

They're unable to understand that *Core* isn't an organization, and that it is the node operators who ultimately support core by willfully installing and running the software.
