Well said.

Are you interested in potentially working on a blockchain project? You might enjoy the Blocklancer platform - freelancing on the blockchain...you might be too young to trade crypto (maybe you're still investing), but Blocklancer allows you to earn cryptocurrency for freelance work - developers are always in demand.
I'm working on the project as well and wonder if we might need another developer - can definitely check if you're open! Great work for anybody, but 16? Great job. :)

Very well said. 
I just entered this year, but have given the blockchain/cryptocurrency space my heart and soul. 10-14+ hours a day, every single day. Family may think I'm obsessed when they don't hear from me, but I can only hope they understand that I am fighting for the greater good. For them. 
They don't realize it. They may never realize it - that's okay. This is much more than getting rich and buying a Lambo. This, for me at least, has everything to do with unseating tyrannical businesses and governments across the world that, for too long, have been taking advantage of the people. 'Unaccountable' is the word - you got that right. If everything in history had been on the blockchain, we'd know a lot more truths than we do today, that's for sure.  
Thank you for spending your time to write this post. It has only further inspired me to continue fighting for this cause, knowing there are others out there that believe. Together, we can succeed.

Roflmao - dead on...it was bad about 3-4 months ago and this is just a bigger dip. Blood in the streets = buy time for strong hands. All of the noobs are getting shaken of their gainz by the whales and we'll be on the ride up in due time, I'm almost sure of it. 
Wall Street hasn't made enough money to let Bitcoin fall this hard and stay down, not yet.

BTW, they positioned the commercial terribly - 'Bitcoin folks'...I'm not into the hype crap ICO's brought, but it's interesting that it made a big enough ripple into the corporate world for UpWork to attempt to make a commercial with. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:00:06
Interesting perspective you have. Not sure how long you've been in the game, but I'm curious to see how your trading goes with that in mind.
I use overall market cap as an indicator to understand the health of the market. For example, if the overall market capitalization is $127B right now and it grows to $200B - then we know the amount of fiat value the overall market has grown nearly 75%.
Looking at Bitcoin dominance after market cap helps us understand the overall relationship between Bitcoin and all other altcoins. Considering things that affect the entire market, like Bitcoin splitting, it's important to know if Bitcoin is just taking market cap or if people are pulling out all of their fiat from the market.
If market cap goes from $127B to $80B, we have a general idea that the entire market dropped 40%. If Bitcoin dominance rises to 60% at the same time, then you know WHERE to look deeper depending on what your portfolio consists of.
My portfolio is only growing so these indicators seem to be working very well for me :) 
You'd be surprised how much more successful you'll be if you try to see things from other people's perspective - good luck trading!
@_date: 2018-10-12 07:26:06
Have you reached out to UpWork about this directly? I suggest reaching out to them because it will hit a tipping point eventually where enough businesses will be either wanting to use other forms of payment easier OR go to an alternative platform that emerges in the future. 
Thanks for sharing your insights too btw! 
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:12:28
Uh, not the entire community involved with cryptocurrency and Bitcoin pays attention to the price 24/7. Most do I'm sure, but new market cap = new heights. Since when has Bitcoin had a $60B market cap? Can almost guarantee you anybody outside of cryptocurrency in finance/FOREX isn't even following that closely.
So if you're a noob and type in "bitcoin" in Google and find a Reddit channel and follow - prolly going to look through the feed first, right? Well noob isn't going to have an idea how much Bitcoin is worth, but they have probably seen a headline somewhere about the price and seeing $3600 as a new high = new number to them AND anybody involved in Bitcoin. Big number too. The piece of content alone does not have a ton of information either, though it does have some - my blog is an entire library for any crypto-noob to start sniffing around to get interested in a cool project - also different time zones...

Is there really a big difference between code vs paper/metal money? 
Yeah, code doesn't change, but the value of the USD has collapsed before and there are many foreign currencies collapsing across the globe. This will undoubtedly reach the more developed economies and hurt them, no matter how hard they try to defend their fiat currencies. 
I'm not against government or anything like that, but am educated in economics, have been in the space sometime and have been digging deep into the objective facts. The truth of the matter is that fiat currency across the globe is in trouble and $19+ trillion in debt for the USD is more likely to trigger a collapse than anything.
Best way to pay off foreign debt is to print money...

Great point - the internet is still evolving as well after quite a few years.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:01:11
I agree, but we need to continue rallying the community because every time BitcoinCash tries to do this they are appealing to the nature of human greed. Each time it bounces back down at its resistance point, around $1,000, and they start again, we need to hodl around Bitcoin and buy the dips as we know i will only bounce back up as BCH fails at their attempt at 'the flippening.'
We have to remember that they have a lot of power on their side - institutions, businesses, and Chinese miners who don't even know the difference between BTC and BCH...these guys are probably accumulating more BTC from altcoin investors too as they shakeup the market.
 
Let's make sure people know the difference!

Oh wow, sounds like even your 71 year mother understands why people would fork and that it can cause inherent problems. THAT is why this article has the word "fork assaults" in the title because all of these forks are truly an assault on Bitcoin and Satoshi's Vision - only to take away value from the "main chain." Thanks for your comment! Always appreciate the input.

I agree completely, which is why I'm warning the community about this BS altcoin and the centralized leadership behind it.  I do not support that coin you mention.

Lol you may as well, Jesus. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:59:24


Do you have a link or source that explains more? I know Tether itself is having sort of a problem with transparency and have been considered to be creating their own 'Federal Reserve' in a sense. So I would love to learn more about this because only the Tether project has the ability to 'print' them out as far as I knew.
Considering the high level of centralized manipulation with Bitcoin and other markets...it would be helpful to know about that.
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:07:08
If but for this moment.
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:46:18
It’s more an art piece, I’m assuming.


If 1 Bitcoin were worth $10,000,000, then a small bag of groceries, say $50, is only 0.000005 BTC. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:49:17


Right, but this makes a pretty strong assumption that all other things will just be extremely over-priced due to inflation. Just because BTC hits $10,000,000/each doesn't necessarily mean inflation will destroy the purchasing power of it.
On top of that, does fiat inflation rate really have that strong of an effect on BTC price? Or will it? What if BTC hit $10M before any real hyper-inflation occurs?
It's happened in other countries for sure, but [America didn't even experience that level of inflation during The Great Depression]( Quite a few websites have similar figures to this one. I'm aware of the 100 trillion Zimbabwe bank notes as well and am not saying it's impossible for a bag of groceries to cost $10M lol, **just highly unlikely that the purchasing power of Bitcoin decreases at the same rate that consumer inflation increases.**
Although, I'm always open to hear other people's perspective on this stuff! Always open to learning about economics from others. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 04:04:31
Great point here. 
My great grandfather purchased his first vehicle, a milk truck, when he was 12 years old for $15 in the 1930’s. 
Really puts inflation into perspective for me when I think about it. Trillions will definitely be more normal to hear about and quadrillions are imminent.

A run on banks isn’t a bad idea if they can organize it.
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:38:51
I mentioned exactly that up there. Look at Bitcoin Cash though - those BILLIONS in BCH market cap should actually be added to Bitcoin had the fork not happened. What if that continues to happen? 
Bitcoin will not reach what it was first thought to have unless the network figures out a way to retain more of this than fractures keep happening, isn't there another potential  fork opportunity coming up soon?
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:44:59
Yup - democratize access.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:12:51
Eh, it seems to be fluctuating between $4,700-4,800. At least while I was writing the article it flew up to $4,748 and to $4,720 multiple times. Figured it was creeping, but it seems it might fly past $5,000 if fiat money is entering the market at this rate.
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:26:18
Heh. At $10,000, that’s only 12,500 BTC. This is great news for their customers, but that does not seem like a lot.
Specially if the price increases rapidly - the amount of BTC the insurance covers cuts in half if the price doubles to ATH. After thinking more about it, that’s actually a **ton of business risk exposure** if they maxed out their insurance at a low BTC price.
Interesting...maybe this is a bit off, but miners need BTC to be a certain price to cover fees and earn a profit. The higher, the better. 
Institutions that allow futures that are actually settled in BTC face certain potentially devastating risks with *insurance policies to cover some of that risk* on losing deposits. The lower price BTC is, the more of this risk is covered for an institution like Bakkt per insurance ($125M).
Interesting times.

Have referred over 300 people to sign-up to the platform and they stopped counting my earnings like 5 months ago now. Have contacted them at least 3x now and no responses...pretty annoying to have that happen to me considering I helped build their platform. Would be nice if they could at least respond to the issues I have on my end.
Have also heard some weird things about them charging ridiculous amounts to list on their platform, varying from project to project. I try not to keep anything on their platform.

This is a prime reason it's important for the US to have it's prized 'green backs' *extended into so many other economies* across the globe: **they need massive demand for the US Dollar in order to stifle the negative effects of printing more to wipe out national debt.**
Supply and demand is very real and, IMO, is why the US tries so hard to push the US Dollar onto other countries. Demand for the US Dollar within the domestic US economy isn't great enough to withstand negative effects caused by the continued need to increase the USD supply for stuff like wiping out national debt...
