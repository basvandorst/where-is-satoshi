I think it's going to start surging soon. People are just starting to hear about it and get excited! Keep tipping your friends and strangers both, they'll spread the word for you!

I think Bitcoin is going to prove to be a great investment, you just have to be smart enough to think long term. If it was easy to make money everyone would do it. ;)

Ever since I sold something on ebay and got scammed and paypal sided with the buyer I vowed never to use paypal again! Talk about terrible customer service!

This is a nice way to explain Bitcoin to people who are new to it, thanks!

Changetip is the first Bitcoin service that has gotten genuine interest from my family. They all like Twitter so being able to tip via tweets made them see Bitcoin's uniqueness.

Great post op!! I think Bitcoin is inevitable and soon we'll look back and be amazed that anyone doubted its adoption!

In my opinion it will happen much sooner than that. People are starting to hear about Bitcoin and get excited about it!
