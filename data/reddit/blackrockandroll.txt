Why should we care other than to be petty?

This is probably not a good idea no matter how good of an investor you are. It is better to invest scared than invest confidently.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:02:32
Wow that sounds really tacky
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:46:09
jaxx is pretty good imho

He literally made the case for bitcoin yet for some reason used the word 'gold' instead.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:55:47


You dont see anything wrong with that? Bitcoin was built to be a currency. You arent a currency if it doesnt make sense to spend it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:30:35
Do you know what unites a community? It's compromise, not the bullshit "do as we say or bitcoin is dead" attitude of core.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:40:06
This is why bitcoin is a bubble, it is fueled by memes instead of people buying it to use.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:00:18
so you agree core controls bitcoin? And you don't have a serious problem with that?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:38:02
That's such a ridiculous thing to say. You shouldnt get upset at the competition when they are able to provide a better service than you, you should improve your service.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:30:54


Lol wat?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:01:55
It matters bigly, in one case bitcoin is just acting as an investment tool and the other it is acting as a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:18:05


Where are you getting this magical knowledge about the wishes of the community?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:40:05
I am pretty sure the run up from 9k -&gt; 10K was fueled purely by memes
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:54:19
Bye Felicia

They have power because other people choose to follow them. You can just make the same claim about core how 15 developers torpedoed 2x because they refused to compromise.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:20:02
I know we should really stop core from their hostile takeover
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:22:10
it's always been about ego for you people
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:19:08
What if it is cloudy?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:39:44
We are a part of history folks!

I would not say bitcoin is a merely a 'confidence game'. The value of bitcoin is not just the confidence people have in it but it is the value of the network and of the ecosystem. Real time, money and effort went into building the ecosystem. That gives it inertia and staying power. The ecosystem will never just get tossed away.

Did they pay off their house in bitcoin or did they sell their bitcoin for cash and use that to pay off their house? I tried to use bitcoin this weekend. I had to pay 7-8$ dollars in fees (between bitpay and the miners) per transaction. It doesnt really make sense to use bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:55:10
I'm in crypto for the revolutionary tech and it just became abundantly clear that bitcoin is a dinosaur. I'll move on to bigger and better things.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:54:03
I bought a hardware wallet and some stuff on overstock.

Thanks Core for hamstringing bandwidth right when we were hitting mainstream adoption. Dumbasses...

SN is probably dead or lost his keys
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:46:53
What does than? An arbitrary poll of consumer support?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:26:42
probably almost none? maybe we lose a couple percent worth of nodes.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:56:00
So people should only invest in bitcoin to avoid fomo? This comic is stupid
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:52:46
Shit the other portion of your portfolio must be killing it that that 1% is only 10% now
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:14:35

Price =/= success. Number of users is a much much better measure (although I am sure they are correlated).
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:05:10
it does look pretty
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:26:47
Your linked post literally says you want to subvert the market...
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:56:25
Oh wow an entire 1mb blocksize increase??!? bitcoin is doomed
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:55:10
This isn't really a good measure of community support. Not really sure what is though
