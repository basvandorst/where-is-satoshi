Well they set the 75% and no one stopped them.  You speak like this is common thing but protocol change has not happened in the history of bitcoin.  If classic succeeds with 75% why not embrace it.  95% for a somewhat subtle yet important change is unlikely to happen.  There will easily be 5% of users that don't bother to even vote or care to switch.  75% is plenty.

Context.  A threshold is voluntary.  What if classic launched with zero percent.  Placing a threshold has nothing to do in terms of the overall direction of bitcoin and you are trying to say this threshold represents just that.  Research the purpose of having a threshold ever and contrast that with bitcoin development.  Think of all the changes that have zero threshold and then think of your argument again.  A threshold in one implementation does not define consensus for all time.  It is really not connected.

You have missed something

Trezor is better.  Usb sticks break.  Trezor recovery is available for eternity.  100 bucks well well well worth it.  Or borrow someone else's and create a wallet and pass it on.

Ok.  Possibility of more transactions.  If you build it they will come.  Let's build the possibility of more transactions, after that it will become a reality.  More bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:57:29
It leads to more transactions and more users and higher price most likely

Coinbase is   GDAX is number 2.  Earning your coins is truly the best.  But coinbase is really number one.  People just like to complain.  Coinbase.  Also don't sell your coins.  Instead hold your coins.  Long-term holding. . . Find a hardware wallet.  Buy from coinbase.  Its simple.

Only if you are the top computer scientist in the world.  No.  All windows/desktop wallets are vulnerable to the majority of users.  You need your coins offline. For 90% of users this means you need trezor.  The other option is a paper wallet, but that is not easy.  Might as well keep them on an exchange until you get Trezor.  Trezor.  Trezor.

Satoshi Nakamoto, October 04, 2010, 07:48:40 PM "It can be phased in, like: if (blocknumber &gt; 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit / It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete."
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:21:12
The one where the blocksize increases above 1MB.

If there are others, communicate them to him.  Coinbase and gdax are widely considered the best.
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:53:40
Yes I have many links.

Technically, purchasing coins is a TRADE.  Trade away.

YES. And party too!

I didn't say more bitcoins.  I said more bitcoin, as in the network. Scaling the network.  
Lightning is not bitcoin.  It is on top.  Anything can be built on top. 
 Today, if I to send you bitcoin, I can make a transaction on the bitcoin network to your address.  This is the basic functionality of the network, to allow users to transact.  
Increasing the number of transactions allowed on this transaction network is a good thing.  This is what bitcoin was built for, transactions.  
Lightning does not exist today.  It is not used.  In comparison to bitcoin, lightning is a house of cards with many unknown attack vectors.  
Bitcoin has been working since inception, and is antifragile.  The incentive to break this system has been very high for a long period of time yet it grows stronger each day.  
Allowing more transactions on a strong transaction network is a good thing.  Plus miners will still have the option to keep their blocks small.  The checks and balances are in place, raising the limit is what bitcoin was built for.
Raising the limit is the next step.  It is even on that hongKong roadmap.
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:41:03
Yes, increases are coming this year, and also next year!

I don't get you.  Coinbase allows you to buy and sell.  Gdax allows you to buy and sell.  I answered his question.  You did not.  So what now.
@_date: 2016-06-05 01:29:05
Where do you get your coins.  If you get then on coinbase, just keep them there until you get a trezor.  Otherwise electrum and mycelium are ok.  Try bitcoin.org
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:20:20
It equals more transactions.  Bitcoin allows people to make transactions.  A larger blocksize means more transactions, more bitcoin transactions, on the bitcoin network.  More bitcoin man, more.

Well paper wallets are tricky.  Roll dice?  Offline printer?  If your machine is infected. . . Hardware wallet wins.  100$ for peace of mind.  Plus satoshi labs rocks they deserve it.
@_date: 2016-06-05 02:19:00
Ok keep key forked trezor.  Ledger. . . I don't like it.  Perhaps the future ledger, ledger blue will be better.  Start with trezor
