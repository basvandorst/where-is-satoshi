Immediately, I get the following errors:
Subtotal must be specified
Subtotal is not a number
Total must be specified
BTC must be specified
Payment method must be specified
Transaction must be specified
Which is weird because I can only pick one action: withdraw the entire amount to my bank account (and there is no BTC).
Thanks for thinking with me by the way, really appreciate it!

I can only select one bank account, and I don't think I can post something there because when I login, I get redirected to the withdrawal page immediately (so I can't really login for other purposes it seems).

Yup, withdrew numerous times before with no problems.

Correct, they closed my account and told me to transfer my funds. A reason for closing my account was not given, but I certainly didn't do anything illegal.
Transferring BTC and ETH was no problem, but when withdrawing my fiat I get an error, so it seems to be a bug of some sorts. Customer support won't respond however.
I will definitely contact a lawyer if this isn't resolved in a timely manner, but of course I would like to refrain from that if possible.

So I have received a response from Coinbase and they will not provide a reason. I can't believe it. I'll order a Nano Ledger S and transfer the assets to it. Thanks for the replies.

I am not talking bad about Coinbase. I have had no problems earlier with Coinbase whatsoever and it might as well be a mix up (or I did violate some rule without knowing it).
Please don't be paranoid, I'm just asking for help.

I can understand, and I certainly don't see it r/bitcoin's duty to fix Coinbase's horrible customer support. I was hoping to find some pointers how to get in touch with Coinbase as the traditional methods don't seem to work.

Jesus christ people like you are like a muscle that contracts involuntarily whenever you read something ostensibly negative about Bitcoin. Read the god damn post or grow the fuck up.

UPDATE: Coinbase contacted me last week that it should be fixed, but it wasn't. After that, radio silence. It's been THREE WEEKS now. I gave them an ultimatum: fix it this week or they will have to deal with my attorney. I advise everyone else who's being screwed by Coinbase to do the same. Consumer law states that all attorney costs will be for the party in the wrong (which, obviously, is Coinbase).
