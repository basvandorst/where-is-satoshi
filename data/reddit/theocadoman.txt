The issue is this gives us an indication of where we might want to be in terms of costs, but not where we will actually end up

This looks promising,  thanks

Do you have a citation for that? Some people would surely be willing to take the risk of a lower reserve ratio if it meant a better interest rate.

You don't necessarily need physical notes. You could run an electronic system similar to the online banking systems we have at the moment

To complete the analogy she would also need to say "I have to make sure all the stuff you left at my apartment is from legitimate sources so I will need to see original purchase receipts before I can return any of it to you"

If you accept the efficient market hypothesis the expected value of the bitcoins in the future is the same as the current price. If you take the consumer to be risk averse he should spend his coins as soon as possible

The potential advantages would be similar to the advantages of banks over cash. They could:
- Offer an interest rate
- Provide safeguards to help prevent fraudulent / accidental transactions
- Insure your deposits against theft
- Potentially offer faster / cheaper transactions than the bitcoin protocol
Of course you would have to trust the bank, and if they were operating a fractional reserve system those risks would be multiplied. But I think if the bitcoin economy continues to mature these types of services will start to pop up. They may be particularly appealing to less tech savvy users who could perceive managing their own bitcoins as too complicated / risky.

Why wouldn't fractional reserve be possible with bitcoin? You take in someone's bitcoins, set up an online account that says you have this many bitcoins that you can withdraw whenever you want, and loan most of the rest out. It works with any store of value.

You can though. Take instawallet.org for example. If I transfer bitcoins into an instawallet account, all I have to vouch for their existence is some numbers on a screen. If I owed some money to a friend, he could set up an instawallet account and I could transfer the funds and they would appear in his account instantly. Say he then uses that money to buy an indie game, and the developer gives an instawallet address for payment. Then say I happen to work for that developer as a programmer, and at the end of the month she transfers those bitcoins back into my account as payment. Those "bitcoins" have done a full cycle through the economy without a single transaction appearing in the blockchain - they were all instantaneous internal transfers through instawallet. Those numbers on the screen when you go to your account address are acting as the "notes", backing up the real bitcoins. Of course not many people would be willing to trust large sums to instawallet at the moment, but the principle is there. And it would only take a few keystrokes for them to create a new wallet with a positive bitcoin balance that's not actually backed by any real bitcoins, which they could then lend out to someone else.

OK, but is there any theoretical reason a service like the one I just described couldn't exist?
