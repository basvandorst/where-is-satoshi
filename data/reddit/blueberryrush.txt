The 5% owning part was pretty surprising

Exactly this.  Thanks to selling my BTrash bitcoin could literally go to $0 and I would still have made a healthy profit.

My manager in a meeting mentioned a ransom ware attack and the perpetrators wanting to be paid in "bits or something."
This was yesterday.

That's what my BCH was for.  Selling the trash returned very close to my initial investment.  From here on its basically a gravy train (rollercoaster?) now.

Go out of your way to really appreciate the nice things happening to you, no matter how small.
Did you get a green light in a normally busy intersection?  Totally awesome!  That was some great luck, right?  No staring at the fast food sign stuck at the red light today, buddy.  *High 5*
You don't have to pretend that small nice things are life changing, just make sure you appreciate that they are nice things and they happened to you.

My husband and I have drilled "HODL" into her head since buying.  I think the plan is to let the coins sit and then pass them down to the grandkids one day.

I agree with this.  I got a call from my mother in law a month ago which went roughly, "what is bitcoin and how can I buy it?"
She has 2 coins in a coinbase vault now.

To be fair everyone else considers it monopoly money.  I've had lots of people tell me to get out of this "ponzi scheme"

I bought one the day it "spiked" to $1900.  My stomach turned because clearly I was buying during a 'obvious bubble'.  
My MIL bought one at $2550 then another at $2850 just before the July dip.  She wasn't happy with me for a few weeks.  Now she's posting on facebook about how she's made almost $2000 in a month.

Trust me when I say the coins are safer with coinbase than with my in-laws.  They have "grandma's forwarded emails" levels of tech savvy.

Is it buying money or is it buying an asset with value?  If I bought a silver coin with a credit card would that be the same?

Thanks OP!

I don't know about that.  At the risk of sounding like a Disney movie, sometimes you meet someone who you click with so well you can't imagine your life without them.  I met and married my SO less than a year after meeting them.  It's been 9 years now and it's still the best thing that's ever happened to me.
But yeah, if you're not thrilled - over the moon - stars in your eyes - butterflies in your stomach in love with someone then don't marry them.

It needs to be refined like crazy to be deadly.  The bean/thing itself won't randomly kill you if you touch it

I agree.  I don't think you need to convince them to make a sizeable investment, just convince them to use some "funny money" to go in.  Remind them that they don't need to buy a whole coin.  Also, if buying would put them in financial hardship then they are not the people that should be convinced.  I know boomers who have 5 digit "funny money" investments.
I convinced my in-laws by just telling them about what I've done.  They asked a million questions.  I told them that if they ever wanted to buy I could set up an account for them.  Then they bought a single coin because "why not, let's see where this thing goes."

I just sold 1.6 to buy a car.  =(

Where do I find the new account stats with coinbase?
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:06:48
I'm a noob.
Why would they convert it to BTC instead of selling it directly into fiat?

A friend of mine has some "play money" in a pretax account.  In early May I finally convinced him to dip into Cryptocurrency.  He bought six figures of GBTC at $200 but for god knows what reason put a sell order in at 20%.
  So he got his 20% and got out in 5 days.  It's now worth $500.  Had he held... his $160,000 would have turned into $412,000.
Edit:  But if you have POST tax money just buy the bitcoin.  GBTC only has 100,000 BTC so it's crazy over valued at $500 a pop
