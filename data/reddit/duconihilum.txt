 &gt;  We've explained to OP the issue countless times and made offers. 
Disagree. You made an offer to refund / transfer my funds. I wanted my order processed how it was. There was no explanation until this thread. .

If you or anyone would have at least responded to me explaining the situation I would be more sympathetic. You cant send an email to us explaining the siuation? Or even respond to emails pm or calls?
@_date: 2013-03-09 18:38:00
How so
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:23:52
Maybe I'm just worried because I've only used them once for a much smaller transfer and I'm new to using bitcoins, but considering I invested a huge sum of money for me I am stressing out right now. Now my girlfriend thinks I'm an idiot and got scammed out of 200 dollars.
I hope that the money comes through correctly.
I deposited it around 1PM when bitcoins were at 43. Now they're around 50. That's a huge loss if they just give me the 'new' amount!
@_date: 2013-03-10 04:12:33
Nope. I even got confirmation that the order has been processed. The admin said 85 percent of the orders went through but then the rest did not. The issue here is that the only way for me to get my mone
y back was to make this post and I have yet still to get my money back. The admin communicating with me today was the first time I heard anything all week aside from a copy paste email
@_date: 2013-03-09 07:01:29
That warning wasn't there when I deposited my money. I have no idea what happened honestly. It's almost to the point where I consider it stolen. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 08:01:57
I have emailed you, sent you reddit messages, and called you multiple times. I haven't got a word back. There's no excuse for this. I was paying for an 'instant' transfer to bitcoins. I still don't have my money. What gives? 
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:02:26
Yes. Im sure. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 08:00:48
It was hacked, taken down, and brought back up.
If they couldn't handle their business when they started up, they shouldn't have opened up to begin with .
@_date: 2013-03-12 05:25:19
I just wish it didn't take a reddit post and calling them out publicly to help anyone.
I missed out on the last post because I didn't resend the admin my order information for the nth time while he was online. I sent it about an hour after he seemed to sign out (I can't use the internet at work so I have to wait until I'm on break) and because of that, he never responded to me / looked at my information.
Seriously, I've sent an email a day on average, several reddit PM's, and voicemails. I've messaged them one way or another EVERY DAY usually with MULTIPLE METHODS OF COMMUNICATION and I still haven't gotten a direct, personal response to my situation yet! 
I really didn't want to make another thread drawing attention to this issue because I understand they are overwhelmed, but I feel like this may be the only way for my issue to be resolved whatsoever.   When I made the thread a day or two ago, that was the only time I got ANY response whatsoever that wasn't a copy paste / do nothing. That response was 'what is your order information' and days later we still don't know what is going on. 
Seriously, this company is awesome when they are being reliable - the fact that I could use cash to get bitcoins in under an hour really appealed me. Now that my money has been locked up for a week things are looking extremely frustrating to me - especially the way the bitcoin market has been.
Not to mention that this was my first bitcoin transaction I did all by myself. I've transferred bitcoins to friends by bitinstant in payment of services, but the first time I decide to get some myself I get totally screwed over.
Seriously, if support would have messaged me the next day with an explanation and a fix, I would have been 100% satisfied - but now with the constant ignoring of messages / emails / etc it's just frustrating. I don't care how high volume you are right now - does that mean you completely ignore support inquiries? Shouldn't there be at least a queue I get put in? Or is it only the people who yell the loudest that get noticed - because I don't think human eyes even considered my situation until I made a reddit post.
Here's hoping that this gets resolved TUESDAY.

They lost bitcoins and closed down for the weekend to sort things out.
They opened up their services monday.
If they weren't capable of running things smoothly monday they shouldn't have brought things back up.
I wouldn't be so mad if I had any communication from anyone about this. I've got one email back about getting my funds within "24 hours" and that was a few days ago.
Imagine if you went to the bank to deposit your paycheck and it never went into your account. Then they completely blew you off and ignored you for a week. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:28:41
Its been over a week and I've yet to see my money. Doesn't sound fast to me. 
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:17:41
I sent you a pm with the order information this afternoon
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:01:07
I bought bitcoins to bitcoin address. I'm just worried considering this is half a paycheck for me and a huge sum of money. If I were to hear something like that from a support member it would be different but they have been silent thus far. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 07:59:43
I can't attest for everyone elses situation, but I have a thread going on right now with a similar issue.
In my situation, the funds have been released by zipzap to bitinstant. 
The problem here is 100% bitinstant. Bitinstant has my money, but for one reason or another is not converting it to bitcoins and giving it back to me. They are effectively borrowing 200 dollars from me. 
I paid a premium to have my money 'instantly'. If I don't receive a total refund of their fees I'm going to be pretty mad. 
I've left multiple messages, emails, and even reddit messages to no response. Either they are down-wright stealing my money to cover their losses or they aren't working as advertised and doing a totally piss poor job.
I deposited my money at the start of the week when bitcoins were at 42. They went up to 50. I could have, if I wanted to, earned a very easy 40 dollars on that if I would have sold them that day. Now I didn't even have that option because a service that offers "instant" bitcoins stole my money and refuses to have a real person respond to my concerns.

Hell are you looking for full time employees or part time? Work from home or in your office? 
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:53:57
No idea. I would love to know though. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 07:39:34
I don't see why. They have had my money since Monday. It's not like they haven't been paid. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 08:00:16
I felt the same way until they held 200+ dollars of mine in limbo. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 05:32:20
For the most part it seems to. But for a lot of orders lately, they have been locked up. Good luck getting your money back if they do. I've sent a dozen total messages either via phone, redddit, or email to no real response or action. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 08:06:07
They got hacked over the weekend and shut down their website when that happened. They opened up monday with the blog post saying things were fine now.
Apparently not, because they can't process orders. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:27:51
Do NOT buy through bitinstant.
I have had over 200 dollars locked up with them for about a week and they have not responded to calls, emails, or PM's in any substantial way. The admin asked for my order information (only because I made a front page post on this subreddit) two days ago and I thought it would be resolved but he still hasn't messaged be back yet.
Terrible experience.
