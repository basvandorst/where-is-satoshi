Mix a cashless society with governments currently pushing for required backdoor "brick" abilities to cell phones.  This leads to a government with the power to turn off the communications and bank accounts of anyone they want at a moment's notice.

Haha, no.  I wish I was that baller.

Many governments restrict citizens from owning gold.
Other countries don't allow gold to leave their borders.
Gold as a means of transmission of funds is limited by the ability to physically pass it from one party to another.
Gold can't be used as an payment method for international micro-transactions for web services or digital product purchases.
The hoarding of gold for the physical value, makes the usage of gold for its tangible scientific and technological benefits all the more difficult.

Can confirm, peanut butter on burgers is amazing. There is something about mixing 3 kinds of saturated fat from the beef, the cheddar, and the PB that creates a mouthwatering tastegasm.  I like to put a quarter inch round cut slice of a slightly sour grilled granny smith on there.

So what you are saying is China is leveraging Russia's military right now by purchasing their bonds and oil?

Bacon optional, though encouraged.

A lot of places around the world this could have been a reality.  Egypt turned off cell service during the arab spring.  Turkey has been attempting to block youtube and twitter.  Argentina had the "disappeared" of the 70s during their juntas.  Lighthearted worries about the philosophical effect of these decisions in the US, often apply themselves as a reality in foreign countries.

If the comment made from Satoshi's account during the unfortunate Dorian escapade is legitimate, then I would believe Satoshi will reveal theirself when they so desire.

If you're going to pay the price of a beer for Andreas' work, just buy it from him, geez.

Antonopoulos speaks in Canada... Assimilates with local culture by opening his presentation with an apology.

Listen to the first one, it was fantastic.  This second podcast was kind of crappy.  Andreas seemed like he was having an off day and the topics never really engaged Joe.

At 22:40 when it talks about Satoshi, they humorously use a pixelated picture of Dorian to indicate the unknown (not Dorian) creator.
