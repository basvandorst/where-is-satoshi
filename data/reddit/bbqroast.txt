I'd guess coinbase wants to be a profitable company as opposed to one of those hip new startups that get billions in much needed venture capital as they consistently make a huge loss. It's not sustainable to run a company on venture funding in the long term, which is why funding should be used on things like new servers, staff and codebase upgrades.

Most depictions of pre industrial tax seem to be of tax men simply taking a fixed amount/as much as they can - I don't really agree with that system. I think for the most part people will still pay income tax with bitcoin, as the website described tax dodging is normally discovered by looking at flaunted wealth (properties, cars, etc) which are easy to review as opposed to looking at income which is easier to hide.

I pay you with one btc, then I given the same btc to someone else. Who gets it? That's decided by the bitcoin miners, if the next block contains my transaction, and that block is in the longest chain then nodes will see it as valid. If ghash.io has 51% of the hashing power they can out pace all the legitimate nodes, create the longest chain and control which transactions are valid, allowing them to double spend or reverse transactions.

How is the USD intrinsic at all?
The USD is only intrinsic because it is universally accepted. Bitcoin isn't quite so universal, but acceptance is still existent enough that it has value. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 20:23:11
No this is nothing to do with the two generals problem.
This is simple, simple, simple reasoning: there's no way a node can know that two nodes (which cannot be trusted, because anyone can create as many nodes as they want) transferred data.
Bitcoin works because the sending node (the receiving node does nothing) is able to prove that it received Bitcoins. Each transaction has outputs, in order to use an output in another transaction you take it, sign a message that describes your transaction (take this output, send half of it to this guy and half of it back to me) and then sign it with your own private key (the public key being the address the output was sent to). Please read Satoshi's white paper so you understand this.
Bandwidth is an *entirely different matter*. What is to stop me creating two nodes, and telling them to claim that one of them is storing 5PB of data for the other? (Thus giving me nearly unlimited storage space in the network at next to no cost).

Nodes allow other people to connect to the network.
It's important that you ensure that you have port forwarded properly, there's concern that we could run out of "connectable nodes". That is nodes that allow you to connect, and have no already became fully connected (generally people cap it to a couple dozen connections).
When people don't port forward, they take several connectable slots of the Bitcoin swarm up without contributing more.

It's a bit of a circle jerk really. Some points are ok, most aren't. I don't know how fiat stops debt and improves job prospects. Bitcoin actually creates wealth distribution issues (those early buyers), but they mainly stem from capitalism for fiat (which Bitcoin does not even modify).
Then we make the jump to improving prospects of survival and third world mobility. For global decision making I have *no* idea. Third world mobility could be helped a bit with a solid currency for them to trade in, but I imagine the slave drivers will still find a way to ensure they stay enslaved.

The problem is that two armies, planning to attack a city, can only communicate through it. They have no preshared key but must be able to identify each other.

For those that don't know why: ghash.io is approaching 51% of the network hashing power. To avoid allowing ghash to take control of the network move your mining power into a smaller pool. One with ~10% share or better yet use p2p mining - although that's still proving difficult to setup.

"How much money has been put into Bitcoin" is hard to answer because different amounts of money were spent on it at different price levels + you might want to include the total cost of mining equipment + electricity used. That gets very complex and requires lots of sources to cooperate.

~12million btc * ~850 us per btc = 10 billion us dollars.

Not so much that, rather that you must wade through Earth's dense atmosphere to get into Space, then accelerate to 8km/s to stay there.

Simply put the miners are running the entire block (the hash of the previous block + all the transactions that occurred since the last), along with a random nonce through a hashing algorithm. This produces a number, they're trying to get that number below a set level (which is lowered to make it more difficult as more power mines at the network). To do this they change the nonce and test trillions of times. That's what people mean when they say they have a one terahash miner (1 trillion hashes a second).
To put it in perspective it takes the entire network, which I believe runs at several thousand trillion hashes a second, 10 ~ minutes to find a valid solution. The winner gets 25 bitcoin which is about 20 grand US.
When a new person joins the network they simply look for the longest, most difficult chain of blocks and use that as the list of all previous transactions.

Hardly, the increase in value is significantly greater than the decrease due to the increased currency base.

The 21 million coin limit has its uses. Divide each coin into a trillion pieces and suddenly that limit approaches the upper end of a BigInteger.

In short:
Instead of being produced at a mint, Bitcoin is produced by "mining", a computer intensive operation. Coins are handed out in a "mining competition" every 10 minutes, which also validates transactions across the network.
Most people will buy and sell Bitcoins at an exchange, just like any other currency.
To "hold" Bitcoins you use a program called a "wallet". With your wallet program you will create a **private key** and public key (**bitcoin address**). The private key is kept secret in your wallet (normally password protected incase someone steals your PC) and mathematically confirms that you own any BTC sent to your bitcoin address.
Some websites store Bitcoin online, however this is often unsafe as they have control over your BTC. Several have suffered major hacks or accidents in the past (I heard of 10K of other people's BTC being accidentally deleted by a hapless server admin - that's several million USD today).
Bitcoin addresses are long strings, however we also use QR codes and phone apps for easy usage. Your private key can be copied (think of it like a password to your Bitcoin "account"). For example you can have a spending wallet accessible from both your phone and PC, or even print out your key and stow it in a safe place.

Have you taken those stupid basic economics courses? One of the ideas of that is that supply goes up with price. That works with btc to.
At 850 maybe the community is willing to spend 100btc. If you want  1000btc you might need to ask for 1000 dollars. 
But it gets worse, when the price jumps 150 dollars suddenly people start believing the currency is going into a growth stage of a bubble. People want to sell less and more people learn of bitcoin and want it too - driving the price up in a bubble.

Mining bitcoins is very difficult and even using high end GPUs connected to a pool you may not receive a payout for a while. Most modern miners use expensive ASIC mining machines.
Most people will buy Bitcoin from an exchange - just like getting Euros from USD. Coinbase seems popular in the US, I used coined.co.nz to buy mine from New Zealand and there's always the Local Bitcoins website which has global presence (it's a directory that allows you to find nearby traders, some will require bank transfers while others will meet in person over lunch).

Depends on the situation, you can verify it instantly if you have your own version of the blockchain (you can remove all the spent outputs to massively reduce storage space if needed) and all recent transactions, for large transactions you may want to wait for a block to be mined 1-20mins. 
A 0 conformation transaction broadcasted to you by a major peer (ie a big mining node) is normally relatively secure.

You have to perform an algorithm on a random number + some data and get a number within a certain limit before anyone else does to mine some bitcoins.

Credit cards take far longer to confirm, and often transactions can be reversed weeks after (I had a friend who lost 2k after a transaction was reversed, unless you're a major vendor it's impossible to fight). 
In this case it's not going to be the cameras catching the thieves, but rather identifying them. 
Also, transactions actually propagate incredibly quickly (like blink fast in some situations). You yourself, or a third party provider, can provide a service which listens to the network for a potential doublespend and warns the cashier (if the doublespend doesn't appear in a few seconds it's unlikely it will be included in the block before the valid transaction). 
Finally, many transactions are already done off chain (less/no fees, often paired with an exchange wallet, etc). Especially smaller ones (ie ones where you're not willing to wait), in this case blockchain confirmation doesn't matter at all.

I believe the battery has an A/C unit so the battery itself should be fine.
Sadly power usage is increased, unlike a petrol engine which generates heat which can be used to heat the cabin an electric car needs a separate heating system. As such keeping the car warm in the winter uses more electricity. On the plus side you can preheat it from your smart phone (when it's still on the house's electricity), so no more freezing cold cars in the morning.

Having used QR codes for BTC payments my self I disagree greatly.
QR Codes are amazingly good at what they do for Bitcoin.
- They work really well. At least with my app I've never had issues with it not focusing, even in different life levels (SIII mini, hardly high end). 
- They transfer lots of custom information (eg price, notes, etc). 
- They're well integrated with the ecosystem of phones (QR code opens web address, which triggers Bitcoin app).
Now lets compare it to the alternative of using Bluetooth:
- Wait for phone to start Bluetooth.
- Select merchant (what if someone's spoofing? QR Codes allow you to see who you're paying - remember no one wants a central certificate provider).
- Transfer money. Hope it is your order (what if you're in a supermarket with 10 different checkout lanes).
Now with QR Codes:
- Grab out your phone in queue, unlock wallet (always encrypt wallet). Most people have it out anyway (no more waiting for those slow ass credit card machines).
- Scan QR code (my phone can scan it before I've even aimed it at the code).
- Tap "accept".
- Walk away as checkout lane explodes.

All a 51% attack can do is reverse transactions, with the difficulty of doing such increasing with each block that the transaction has been buried in. Note that smaller block times do *not* fix this issue (as that simply means the blocks are easier to mine, thus are easier to reverse). 
Coins cannot be counterfeited or stolen from a wallet unless they've moved in recently (and then they can only be moved back to their old wallet). 
One option for geographically limiting coins could be ping times? I'm not sure if it would be possible, but what if the network was designed so hashing power had to respond to network (the network being the legitimate users) within a certain time?
I'm not sure if that would help at all...

The issue is that it *is* the problem. A decentralized Youtube, Dropbox, Facebook, etc, sounds great until you realize that the thing that pins it all together doesn't work - it's like Bitcoin without it's voting algorithms! 
There's some options I've looked into, one possible solution is to have it all peer based. Each peer identifies itself with a public/private key. Each peer remembers who's done what and what it owes them.
Peer A stores 10GB for peer B. Peer B then stores 10GB of peer C's stuff. Peer A, B &amp; C take note.
Peer A needs to store 15GB, Peer B can't take on the excess load (for whatever reason) and tells peer C (which owes peer B 10GB) to store the remaining 5GB.
The issue is this network of checks and balances relies on the peers making good of the agreement. Peer B could decide to never payback peer A and ignore them. At what point does peer A put its foot down?
Also perhaps a hash of the file contents + random challenge could be provided by the storing node intermittently to guarantee that the files are still stored?

Speed actually doesn't matter at all. For transactions in person committing fraud is very difficult - your risk being caught on video camera and someone may pick up on the double spend before the block is mined (this could be a possible service to provide in the future). 
For online purchases 10 minutes doesn't matter, in game purchases can be rolled back, app store accounts can be frozen, shipped items are unlikely to be dispatched before the 10 minutes is up. The only time it could matter is moving into another digital currency, but most exchanges require you to move coins into their shared wallet before hand.

At 28 million Gigahash/s (according to Blockchain), and about 500MHash per watt (this is the number I worry about, it was the first shipping ASIC I came across, others may be more efficient - sorry the market is such a cluster fuck it was difficult to get numbers) we come out at 56 megawatts.

Valued, not set. A Bitcoin is $200~ USD now because vendors are willing to sell that low and buyers are willing to buy that high (market equilibrium), if the USD goes down then presumably vendors will want more USD for a BTC.

Do not store the wallet on an online service. I'm not saying blockchain.info is evil or anything but it defeats the purpose of Bitcoin to not just store the BTC on your own disk (unless you have a small amount of BTC on blockchain.info for rapid transfers as they're a well connected node).
Store it in a password encrypted wallet on your PC, back it up to a few external storage devices + a cloud provider or two (encrypted of course). It might take 10 minutes to set up but will give you pretty good peace of mind.

- Internet access is becoming more and more commonplace. Even 3rd world countries commonly have atleast some internet access, Bitcoin transactions do not take much bandwidth, they could also be carried out via text messages.
- You misunderstand how BTC works, you can see a transaction as soon as it happens, and thus can check for double spends. A block confirmation or two is only required for very large amounts of cash. Also remember that fraud is much harder in person (because when it bounces &lt;10 minutes later you might not be to far off and security camera footage and such).
- Explain? Obviously BTC storage requires some due diligence. Make backups, don't put your BTC password on a sticky note and buy good antivirus. All are good practices any way.
- As I said in point 2, transactions are quite quick. A confirmation or two from a major mining pool (which will pick it up quickly) is enough to be sure for small amounts of money. If you're trading 10K at a time you can wait for a few minutes surely?

I think some of them are profiting. Some are true rackets, ie the ones that report "delays" so that they can premine with the new tech a bit (Just ensuring the product isn't faulty and all!) but most aren't really doing much wrong. 
They make a capital good which people are over valuing, thus over buying them and producing a surplus of the derivative good making mining unprofitable.

History disagrees with you :).
Think of it this way, you eat food, food comes from farms, food gets to you from farms by road, roads are built by the government. Sure a private organization could build them, but then you'd be in the same position, just having to go through the bother of paying toll fees. More importantly, if you live in somewhere slightly rural then a road is simply economically a stupid idea for a company to build, but governments build them anyway.
As a single being, humans are very weak. We have bad defenses, as we age all our regeneration abilities wear away and we're not very strong. What we are good at is co-ordinating, together a team of humans can out match any animal, one man of the team might spend his day at a desk designing weapons, another might work in a factory building them, et cetera. Alone they're all relatively weak, but together they are mighty, over history humans who organize themselves have came out on top (eg the Romans, Americans, British, Ghandi's revolution movement, et cetera), while those who fall into anarchy (think the last days/years of the Roman Empire, when power became fragmented) have died off.

If you were to loose the key to your Bitcoin address (see my other comment  then the coins are essentially gone. Without the key you can't verify yourself as the owner of the wallet thus the network will not recognize you as the owner of the wallet.
Note that you can backup keys, even print them out on paper (in the form of a QR code) for safe keeping. However, if someone gains access to these keys they can send all the money to an address they own.
If that did occur - your coins being stolen, you can't do much. That being said - in the future law agencies may decide to follow the trail of transactions from your address, while a laundering service would drop the trail it is possible that the thief identifies himself by using the Bitcoins (eg paying his rent, cashing them in at a co-operative exchange, etc).

Normally pool leaders prevent new signups as they approach 51% (because they likely have an investment in Bitcoin). Even if they didn't, miners in the pool have a massive incentive to move their hashing power away as the pool approaches 51% (once a pool passes a certain threshold (at which point the block reward incomes are stable) its size does not matter to the miners, but if the pool gets very big it risks sending uncertainty into the Bitcoin community - reducing the value of coins, as such the miners will want to reduce its growth).

I'd say it shouldn't be a major issue. 10 minutes isn't a huge window. For online transactions most can wait for 10 minutes (shipping products and such) while others (online subscriptions, game cash, etc) can be revoked easily if the transaction turns out to be false. 
As for transactions in person, committing fraud by going to multiple places (which may have cameras) in less than 10 minutes. Is hardly ideal and once the transaction bounces you won't be far away. What's more if the shop system keeps its own version of the block chain (or the service the shop uses it does) then they can verify that your input hasn't already been used (shortening your window for the time it takes your transaction to propagate, which is very short for well connected systems).

When we talk crypto we prefer to say "the likes of which have existed for a few decades". Much like the blocks in the blockchain (which are more secure after being "buried" under the proceeding blocks), new crypto is unsecure (because it hasn't been tested extensively), but with each passing year older crypto becomes more trustable (because it's more likely that any flaws in the crypto would've been found).

The big issue with MultiBit is the risk of a virus getting in, that being said providing you don't keep MultiBit running with your keys installed it should be fine.
Note that it should be best to look up how to properly deal with MultiBit files - as it may save them somewhere else. Also, files can linger for a long time. When you delete a file your only marking it as "deleted", so the hard disk can rewrite over it when it needs to (for another file) - as a result it could stay there for a long time. What's more there's stories of recovering files after 5+ rewrites.
That being said, a password encrypted wallet should be pretty safe.

- Nothing, Bitcoin is just like any other currency in that regard. But why would one exchange buy Bitcoins for $140 while another is selling them for $120? The first exchange can simply buy them direct from the second in the first place.

I like it because of three reasons:
- Easy to setup/receive transactions. You can setup a wallet in less than a minute (download wallet ~10-30 seconds, open wallet &amp; sync with chain (lite client) ~5 seconds, create new address ~2 seconds).
- International transfers. Doesn't matter if the other person is in a country that the US has decided they don't like (eg Cuba), money still moves quickly and effectively.
- No asshole central company drawing back funds, freezing your account during the Steam sale, banning teenagers/kids because you're to young, et cetera.

Ahh but here's the thing, the government is doing an awful lot to that land. They had it originally (well kind of, they probably got pretty bloody in getting it thou) and they've developed it, they're almost renting you the land, but many governments will have some sort of constitution so they can't just take it away.
To put it simply, the land is still the government's. You have the right to "own" it, in return you follow the govt's rules. Bare in mind if you threw off the govt's rule then in return you'd have to give up your rights to use any of the public infrastructure they have developed.

Yes a BTC can be split into up to a trillion bits (each called a "satoshi").

Obviously a welfare state will have more "dependents" than a non welfare state, simply because you can't depend on a state if it's not actually giving you anything.
Dependence isn't an issue, happiness in the short and long term is. I personally feel that a left state is beneficial because it provides a safety net so that people don't starve, allows sustainable economic growth by providing education and healthcare, and can ensure longterm sustainability by interfering with the free market (petrol taxes to deal with global warming, controlling land usage, et cetera).

A Bitcoin "address" is simply the decryption key of a public/private keypair, where one key (in this case the public one) can decrypt and the other can encrypt. 
When you send Bitcoins your simply "signing" (ie encrypting) a message with your private key that says "these Bitcoins go to this address (another person's public key". The network then checks that those Bitcoin were sent to your public key, and if so adds a line to the public ledger "reddelicious77 gave bbqroast 1.05BTC".
The paper wallet is simply the private key printed out in some form of computer readable media (QR code, barcode, etc). You can send Bitcoins to the public key and in order to access them you need the private key. The exception being if you "crack" the wallet by trying to generate billions of keypairs in the hope that one is in use.

We're talking about bandwidth, not latency. You can still have 100mbps on a 10 second latency connection. Satellites normally have a few hundred ms of latency, depending on their height. 
The issue with these tiny satellites is they have very little power for radio thus little bandwidth which may be needed for many uses. As such sometimes it makes more sense to measure by the minute or hour, as you may not be able to guarantee bandwidth per second (ie you might have two seconds of radio usage every 5 seconds for you application).

War is very interesting in an economical sense.
The profit from war is rarely material goods, yet the victors in war often win out immensely (see America before and after WWII). Perhaps the biggest effects of war are three things:
- It makes government spending unquestionable - we can, quite literally, throw more money than exists in the world at something if it's war related.
- Motivated economy, while these tend to flop in the long term (see Russia and other state controlled economies) they certainly fly forward in short bursts (ie WWII).
- Technological leap, the combination of the two above allows technology to leap ahead. Radar barely existed at the start of WWII, but by the end of it radar was one of the most important aspects of a modern defense, and offence system - and indeed what little did exist before WWII was driven purely by the idea "wait, could this detect enemy ships in heavy fog!?!". 
 
War certainly isn't right but it definitely pushes humanity forward. Some of our most momentous achievements (large aircraft, internet, moon landing, etc) were driven by either the threat of war, or war itself.

Make sure you keep password-protected backups of your wallet, offsite is recommended. DO NOT use a "bitcoin banking" service that holds the Bitcoins on their servers, no reason to let someone else's incompetence wipe out your BTC (read an article a while back about a guy who wiped 75K worth of other people's Bitcoins from his server).

A million dollars isn't an awful lot, plenty of upper middle class families will have multi-million dollars worth of assets (house, cars, etc). The average person in the US will generate about 1.5 million dollars in their life time.
Being a millionaire due to Bitcoin's deflation would be wonderful, but it's certainly not impossible. Over time I think you'll find those massive Bitcoin funds will be leaked away at, either by the occasional spend or taxes (in France for example you have to pay taxes on inherited goods).

Actually the US govt paid a huge part in developing the US rail road system (back when it was vital to life), granting land and federal funding. They also build a vast majority of public roads.
Governments can regulate companies to keep them in check, which is always useful (capitalism ensures that big companies get bigger faster than smaller ones, note that even America is much more anti-corporate than a "free market).
In other parts of the world health care is very cheap due to govt intervention (by refusing to pay a high price to medical suppliers, who can't just sell to another insurance company).
Governments pay a huge part in starting off things like the internet, technological advances, etc through federal funding (take the moon landing and space for example).
Also, what you're suggesting with the community thing? That's basically a smaller direct democracy (where votes are determined by wealth, not existence). 
The government is great at one thing when doing things correctly: equalizing. Crime, violence, etc are all linked to equality. Does he have something I don't? I'm not advocating communism, but it's much nicer when getting a good education, healthcare and life isn't dependent on being born into the right family.

^ This is a good point, when an industry dies another pops up in its place.
Take the movie industry for example, in the UK and other countries they insist that the entire economy will die if they don't get paid, yet when you pirate a movie you don't go outside and burn 10 dollars. You go and spend it at the corner store on some pop corn (which arguably, is more beneficial to your local company because corner stores don't funnel the money into Cuba for it never to be seen again).

As in GST (or VAT I think)?
Sales tax is more of an issue, but if you're running a store it's still easy for the govt to say, (assuming they've already gone over your income tax) you're making this much money from your store and therefore it must becoming from your sales, so why aren't you paying any GST (or very little GST).
Bitcoin is interesting because it's actually a very good protocol for taxation (correct me if I'm wrong here) as every transaction is logged in the publicly accessible block chain. A computer could do a decent bit of the job automatically. 
Sales tax (still assuming you mean GST/VAT/etc I don't know a lot about the various terms) is generally very good because of how simple it is. Normally its just a percentage of the sale that must be given to the govt, that works well because it's so easy to do. Most merchants will just do it automatically.

One way to think of the growth is the fact that when Bitcoin first started you could mine with a shitty i3 and probably make 100s of BTC a day, there was that guy who bought a pizza for 10,000 BTC.
Now BTCs cost $200+ each. That pizza (say $20) sold today at the same price would've sold at 2 *million* dollars worth of BTC. We could argue that the Bitcoin is now worth 100,000 times what it was back then. Do that again and Bitcoin has a market cap of $200 (not counting for inflation) trillion and I have 5.8 million NZD. It probably won't make such a massive jump (at least not for a long time), but it'll certainly grow.

Hard disk size constantly rises as well. Also, I guess there's no reason you can't prune the Blockchain back, only including transactions that haven't been used as inputs yet, keeping you Blockchain relatively small.
Still, it costs very little to run a server with a few TBs of storage space and an internet connection.
Edit: Just to give you an idea that **14GB scales down to just 12.5MB** when pruned of spent transactions.

Depends where do you live? Coinbase is based in the US, but it seems very slow. I live in NZ and use coined.co.nz (higher rate but they move coins the same day or tomorrow depending on timing).

Can you not read the OP?
The 10 minute confirmation time is arbitrary. Listen to some major nodes and you'll pick up the transaction within seconds (especially if you're customer base is listening to the same nodes - eg light mobile wallets). If you're really paranoid you can confirm it yourself (check Blockchain, check keys). 
The block confirmation time doesn't really matter, only for moving large amounts of money. What's more a shorter time makes it less secure (as the hash is now 1/4 the difficulty).

But odds (at least perceived) can be derived from what people are betting on each side. Which is how this website works out how much to payout.
A standard betting company will do the same, running the numbers before hand to try and estimate how much people will bet on each side and setting the payout based on that.

Transactions are relayed immediately by nodes providing that node sees it as valid. If a trustable node relays the transaction to you its safe to confirm for small (&lt;500) amounts, especially if the transaction is done in person.

Well it is kind of voluntary already. You could leave America (or wherever you are) and go to some country where there's no taxes (most countries have tax, but lots of countries don't proactively collect tax, but at the same time they don't provide services).
@_date: 2013-02-15 10:12:16
TBH I'd rather live in a country with a government that (oh god) taxes me than a country where I have to purchase my own security force and live with an electrified fence.
The entire point of taxation is that certain, important, services only work well when distributed to everyone. For example police, a few policemen can roam an entire neighbour hood and keep it safe, while a security team that only responds to a few houses would be far less effective. More importantly, policing is something that works well if it's everywhere. If a criminal can rob other people (who don't have security) then its stepping stones to robbing you.
Anarchy sounds wonderful until that sudden realization hits you, you probably don't want to spend your entire life governing your own little state (ie your property and self) and even if you don't mind you probably won't be able to afford anything (unless you have lots of money you inherited or something).
Anarchy is a system that kills off the poor, weighs down the middle class and makes living ugly for the rich (I don't want to live in a world where I need a security team to take a walk, which I don't because there's tax payed police men patrolling).

Bitcoins can be divided down to 8 digits I think. A "Bitcoin" is simply a term for the money, the balance of each user is kept in a massive, decentralized public ledger (see blockchain.info for a over view), anyone can help with the book keeping (you'll even get paid!), to find a user's balance we just run through the Blockchain to see how many coins have been deposited in their wallet.
To prevent others spending your money you have two mathematically related keys. One acts as your address and the other is kept secret, you can encrypt something with the latter which can only be decrypted with the former. The result is that you can prove to others that you own the wallet (address).

Some estimates peg the original Apollo missions at $18 billion each, so we're not to far off. That being said I bet a modern lunar mission would cost less than $2 billion if managed correctly, hell they could probably get it down into the 100s of millions range.

Out of interest, has there been any indication that Satoshi is even alive? For all we know he could have stepped of a road accidentally and gotten mashed by a passing car, or some other common means of death (or he could have been assassinated by Obama's hit squad, take your pick). He could be dead, taking his million odd bitcoins with him to the grave.

On the flip side connectable peers are a scarce resource. By doing this you consume some of the connectable peers without providing more. With fewer peers to connect to new nodes cannot easily connect to the network.

My bad, I thought you meant wait for the price to go to $1000 and then it would be profitable to mine using solar panels, I see now that you meant to use the ridiculous amounts of money some of us could make (if Bitcoin goes "to the moon") to buy solar panels for your house.

To be honest, as long as you have good anti-virus I think you'll be pretty safe. I don't think I've seen a virus yet that specifically targets Bitcoin wallets (ie getting the private keys, listening for the password, etc).
Also there should be a way in MultiBit (or another application at least) to view an address without the private key (so you can ride the Bitcoin Rollercoaster^^TM in realtime^^^patent ^^^pending).

A fork probably would occur if this were to happen. Bitcoin miners and nodes know that the Bitcoin is valuable because of its decentralized nature, if it were to become centralized they would have an incentive to quickly and universally push against it - otherwise the coin looses its value along with their mining equipment.

The countries aren't though, which was his point. "Social advancement" != having a few really rich people. 
Nigeria brings in a wopping $2.8K (1.7K nominal) per capita each year and has a high GINI (inequality measurement) and low HDI (development) stat.
Saudi has done a bit better, with a decent per capita income (25K, still not getting near Norway) but I can't find a GINI rating.

I'm really confused what you're trying to get at.
- Locked doors are easy to get past. That's a major issue.
- That's a major breach of civil liberties which is wrong (seeing as they're doing it in the dark). It could potentially be a major issue as they have dirt on millions, if not billions of people.
- That's not a major issue. More people die of lightning strikes than terrorism. What's more the cost to prevent it is huge (even with the massive spending on TSA and millions of man hours lost waiting at airports, people still wander through TSA with guns, explosives and god knows what else). 
Proper security is about weighing the cost/risk. That's why people living on farms leave their doors unlocked while people living in the city put shutters over their windows and leave their lights on when they go out for dinner.

REAMDE was great.
Cryptnomicon is also awesome, but a bit longer.
The Baroque Cycle is also really cool, but it's three rather long books.
Little Brother is a must read.
TL;DR Read Little Brother (it's pretty good literature, the issues covered in it however are far more important, you can download the book online from the authors blog, donate if you want to pay him) then REAMDE followed by Cryptonomicon. Little Brother isn't to long.
All of the books I listed are really good (if I had to pick my worst it would be the Diamond Age) and I enjoyed them a ton.

What concerns me is that there's no one in there who understands Bitcoin and can advocate for it.
A lot of people seem concerned about things like this happening, but govt involvement is going to happen sooner or later and better to shape it our way (for example, if Bitcoins are officially recognized as a currency it saves us from legal headaches about what the bits actually are and provides additional protections).

He's going to the south pole, as in the actual south pole not a base. I'm assuming that he's not going to have an IT department (unless I misread it and he's planning on doing the transaction when he gets back to a base). 
Either way, there's no reason to download the blockchain, there's 10s if not 100s of free wallet apps that don't need the blockchain to function.

Hacking into Bitcoin is impossible with current known methods.
Here's the answer to both questions:
A "wallet" is simply a key pair encrypted with asymmetric encryption, that is you have two keys one for encrypting and the other for decryption. The former is used as your "private key" and the latter is used as your "address".
When you send a Bitcoin you encrypt a message saying "I give (someone else's address) 0.5 BTC" with your private key and include a message showing your "inputs" (ie the coins that were given to you previously). The nodes on the network track down the inputs you used and use the to address on those to decrypt your new transaction. If you owned the coins then the thing makes sense, other wise it doesn't work. In order to "hack" the system you have to have the private key belonging to a user.
Mt Gox and Blockchain have different addresses for you because they both have different private keys. Some online wallet services will let you export a private key and then you could upload it to another service and use it there.
Really there's no reason to bother. Just download a Bitcoin client (I recommend MultiBit), create a (password protected) wallet and send the Bitcoins from the online wallets to your new address. Now you have complete control over the coins (protip, make a (encrypted) backup of the private key stored in MultiBit and email it to your GMail account or something incase your computer explodes).

Bitcoin is an amazing currency that could change the very meaning of money. That being said, it's not some Anarchist's wet dream to overthrow the government, if anything bitcoin is perhaps easier to tax than regular money (to the point where you wouldn't even need a human to perform tax audits).

It's lovely not to have to pay high taxes, until you're starving on the street.
