If your transaction is sent to mempool 30 seconds before the newly mined block, it can be confirmed in less than 10min..
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:58:02
Yes that's what i meant.

If it reaches your stop loss then goes back up, what do you do? Wait for another dip? What if it never comes?
When you think long term, the short term price fluctuation should not matter. And if you really were unlucky on timing, you can bring your average cost down by keeping on buying.

This happen if you owned bitcoin before the bitcoin cash fork happened
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:59:20
Why would it? Equities are shares of a company, the currency you measure their value with really doesn't matter. Bonds are another matter it's true.

To explain it in simple terms:
Bitcoin cash was created on a disagreement on where to go with the technology going forward.
They made a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain just before Augustus and went their own way from there (size of blocks after this date is higher than on the Bitcoin chain)
This means that if you had bitcoin before they made the copy, your wallet also happened to be on Bitcoin cash! Fantastic news isnt it?

You're the one who does not get it. I have used exchanges for over 3 years.
Poor people can't afford letting fiat sitting on exchanges to be "able to" insta rebuy any crypto they would spend. They would rather leave nothing and only convert the exact amount.
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:24:05
Reputation on basis of your past loans and ability to repay them, not the the way you Say "Hi". That's one of the things that your bank is already doing by the way.

Finally the comment I was looking for. Thanks for exposing this gigantic dumbass.

No I wasn't ? That's the counterargument I have been using since your "leaving Fiat on exchange" suggestion. Whatever.

This post makes 0 sense.
Once you've bought all your miners, shutdown price/Operation BEP will always only depend of electricity cost (+ renting place if relevant) and never depend on your miners buying price.
It actually does not matter if you bought your miners 1 dollar or a billion dollars in the first place as this will not affect the Bitcoin price at which you would stop mining.
You can try and make your accounting weird but only people who are really bad at logic will get your point.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:06:38
What did i say about BCH?
It's just so typical of americans to think it's their "rights" to communicate in english while not even trying to learn a foreign language (except maybe for french which you only know one sentence of to sound like a smartass)
@_date: 2018-08-21 16:05:59
Yes, but if you're accounting 2 business days for your SEPA to reach an exchange and doing many transactions, the cost (or gain) due to delay can add up.
@_date: 2018-08-21 18:55:29
You realize this method actually means you must be able to afford a bigger buffer of money right?..
Fiat sitting on exchange can't be used for your typical every day transaction.
@_date: 2018-08-21 12:28:29
Price fluctuation is the reason it is not used much as a medium of exchange.
With more adoption (including holders), the liquidity increases and volatility decreases, meaning it becomes a great store of value. It can then become a great medium of exchange.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:26:21
Everyone here knows you're wrong and bad at logic.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:04:43


Such a stupid thing to assume without knowing anything about me. Oh wellz, I am not gonna join your dick measuring contest.
@_date: 2018-05-29 17:08:51
You're the one who still don't get it as it has been explained to you in many comments since you've been exposed.
My example about the price you bought your miners at was just to illustrate that it is independant of your decision to mine or shutdown.
If you still don't get it, there's nothing that can be done for you.

1. The Bitcoin protocol is asking computers to find a right nonce for which the resulting hash must meet some expected pattern. For example, that it starts with thirteen zeros.
2. The protocol adjusts the difficulty so that block are found every 10 minutes. If  price explodes and more people mine, blocks may be found every 7 minutes for some time because difficulty only adjust every 2 weeks. When it adjusts, it may now ask for a hash starting with fourteen zeros.
3. Consensus is the mechanism by which changes are made and accepted. If MrRoger 2.0 wants to go for 42 millions Bitcoins, he might gain some traction but also lot of opposition. Ultimately there will be a fork and one Blockchain with 21 millions max and another one with the 42 millions will exist. Whichever has more acceptance will be recognized as the "real" Bitcoin. In reality, both blockchains are just as valid, there's just more people agreing on one. It's not a democracy because the minority is not "losing", they can still do whatever they want with their new ledger.
That's exactly what happened with Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash/Bitcoin Gold.

Plenty of beliefs aren't about religion and are useful. Our society is built upon these. You believe in human rights, you believe in the function of president or prime minister, you believe in the company Amazon, and finally if you use it, you believe in money. Those are all imaginary things.
Bitcoin is no different.

Thank you.
What I get from this post is that OP has bought his miners at the luckiest time and has no clue about how to calculate operation cost. However, it doesn't matter because his margin is high as fuck anyway.

It does not matter if you know it's unfair. You can't be your own bank with Fiat. With Bitcoin you can.

Ask Greece in 2008 why fractional reserve banking is a scam. It works fine until it does not, when people need their money the most.
It is a scam because you effectively lend money you don't have. Bankers hide behind complicated structures and legal terms but this is actually very simple. You can try and argue all you want about why it's not a scam but it is.
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:27:21
Do you really take me for an idiot that would use that term without knowing what it means? Sure, you can do the same with Bitcoin.. until someone ask you to disclose all your owned public adresses. The point is that current banking does not let you any choice, like the system or not, you're obligated to use it and implicitly accept its unfair rules.
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:22:57
I have one too, and fractional reserve banking and quantitative easing are scams. Many renowned economists contest any benefit it might have on the economy.

Everyone saying Bitcoin 3k has no understanding of the market limited supply + miners game theory. At this point, bitcoin going to 3k in the next few months is as likely as Bitcoin going to 100k.

You do not want a turing complete Bitcoin. Turing complete means less security and more bugs than a simple and robust protocol.

Hindsight IS 20/20. It was smart to sell half when it got to 100 if you invested heavily when it was worth barely nothing.

That's a misconception. Imagine there's only hodlers and interested buyers, the buy orders would keep getting higher and higher until hodlers reach their personal moons and sell into those. There's always a price.

As more people get into Bitcoin (either for investment or for use), adoption and liquidity increases and volatility decreases. On the longterm trend, volatility is decreasing.
