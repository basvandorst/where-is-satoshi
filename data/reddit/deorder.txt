The same with operating systems:
"Nobody blames a commercial OS when hardware does not work,  but if they used a open-source OS suddenly it's a open-source OS problem"
And many other things...

At least NYT does not talk about BTC-e being "one of the largest cybercrime websites in the world" but just call them "one of the oldest trading platforms for digital currencies".
They talk about the person that was caught being **one** of the key persons. Implying there are still more people running it.
They say "BTC-e did not immediately respond to a request for comment". Implying they are still there.
So hopefully it will be back up soon. They already have a landing page on their website showing "Site is under maintenance. We apologize for the inconvenience."

It is crazy how they use people their lack of knowledge to let them believe the worst.
Showing everyone how they caught the next "big criminal" (making it seem worse than it actually is), "confiscate" the coins / money (buy themselves drugs / weapons then auction the rest off) and then hope to  get more funding.

So if this is about BTC-e. They are a cybercrime website now? Will their users get in trouble as well then? 
In 2011, when BTC-e started, people were not even taking bitcoin seriously. 
If it is about tax evasion. Until recently many countries did not have laws about how to tax bitcoin. I am still confused about how to properly report it to the tax authorities myself.
If a wallet is brought over the border it is actually just the key and not the bitcoin (and its value) itself.
And why is the USA involved?

Clear. Thanks ;)

And now innocent non-US people from all over the world become victims of this as well. Like if we do not exist &gt;:(
If they confiscated the wallets the USA will probably end up selling **our** coins / money at a higher price by just auctioning it off (after first buying some things for themselves). Wonder if I can claim my part as I paid my taxes based on the value of my portfolio every year. Can they just claim it to be 100% theirs without any consequences?
Update: If Vinnik actually did what they claim I am happy they caught him. They traced the flow of the stolen Mt.Gox bitcoin all the way to him. Vinnik is one of the BTC-e admins, but not the only one. The other BTC-e admins are probably researching this right now and hopefully helping the authorities to solve the case. I then hope they will quickly move the BTC to another wallet because the current one (key) seems compromised. If they end up solving the case it will be a big plus for bitcoin. May be the Mt.Gox users will even get some of their coins back?
