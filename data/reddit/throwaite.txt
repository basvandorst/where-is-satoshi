Can someone give an estimation of running costs vs income of a mining farm at this point ?  I'm not talking about capital expenditures, only running costs using a reasonable (US?) electricity price.

I would not forget a 500 million laptop

I think so. You have to take into account that resistence heating (miners) is not as efficient as standard heat pumps.  So energy costs will be higher, probably compensated by the generated bitcoins.
When it comes to capital expenditure, silicon chips are much easier, durable and cheaper to make than motors for the heat pump, so at some point in the future, the capital expenditure will favor heating miners. The same can be said of maintenance costs: miners will be cheaper to maintain.

In my country when you buy an imported good you pay the full 21% as VAT, the taxmen do not care about the "value added" thing, they only care about collecting for their masters the politicians.

Price in USD is declining, costs for miners is increasing
Something is gotta give. Hash rate is going to stabilize or go down and only then the miners will stop dumping.
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:17:35
No, we are going back up. Karp is almost done with the dumping

I agree with this, but I wonder why gigantic real state bubbles are not happening, are they?
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:23:34
They earn their own money. They have my respect for that.

and we have  mined only 50% of total earth gold reserves. I can't wait for the next gold mining halving

er, you forgot to mention that the bitcoins need to be kept and not sold for at least one year for scientific verification.

Lost private keys:  Coins Vanished =&gt; Bitcoin user not affected
Low Entropy Keys or internal hacker: Coins Stolen =&gt; Probable dump
Karp is acting : Coins still in possession of MK=&gt; MK is moving target
@_date: 2014-09-18 10:41:35
if you stop the time for a minute, you will see that is not increasing

people should be fleeing from cash, interest rates are negative, what other asset can you buy that guarantees you purchase power in the future?
