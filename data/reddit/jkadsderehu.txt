Been here since early 2013: In the beginning I was a True Believer and thought the technology would take over and be a much better solution than traditional banking for most people. Now I think bitcoin is useless for almost any other purpose than as a speculative asset. That said, I think the price will just keep going up like crazy anyway, so I'm still hodling.

There is already a huge problem on reddit of people reposting other people's content for karma, which is literally fake internet points. This would be greatly exacerbated by making them actually worth something.
There's also psychological research which suggests that giving people a monetary reward for something crowds out intrinsic motivation, potentially changing the interactions from "social" ones to "business" ones.  Dan Ariely writes about this:

Coinbase can try to provide 1099-B forms but they probably don't have the information to do so. If you purchased your bitcoins on another exchange, or in person, or if you mined them yourself, then coinbase has no idea what your cost basis was and therefore cannot compute your capital gains (or losses). 
Since everyone is "their own bank" in the crypto space, the IRS more or less has to rely on people keeping their own records and then voluntarily reporting taxable gains. For better or worse, a lot of people probably won't.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:28:12
This is pretty well thought out and he's probably right that after a fork BTU supporters would sell off all their BTC and vice versa, which probably would tank both prices pretty hard, and that we'll have lingering branding issues trying to convince newcomers about which is the "real" bitcoin.
So I agree that a contentious hard fork is probably very bad for everyone, but the problem is like this: Two armies meet each other in the field, and each says "A battle would greatly harm both of us, therefore *you* should surrender."

I guess my biggest concern is the increase of pettiness between the different sides in this debate. Whatever the result here is, a lot of people will feel like they lost a war, and then they'll be angry and tell everyone that bitcoin has failed, the people making decisions are shills, and that no one can be trusted. 
Even if all the technical things go well it's hard to convince new people to join a community like that.

Well, I think it theoretically *could* change, possibly due to things like decentralized currency and decentralized manufacturing.  But right now wealth disparity is extremely high, and it is still increasing, so it seems extremely premature to say it will *certainly* change.  The invention of the internet decentralized knowledge and had a profound transformative effect on society; nevertheless, this did little good to the economic standing of the lower classes.
I think there is a bright future for clever people, but I think there are a lot of other people who are going to find it impossible to find employment, even though they could have found it easily in 1950.

No I agree with this guy.  There is risk in paying off debt, because there can always be a large scale collapse of society.  Now, most first-world people in our century have no experience with this, but last century was quite different.  If you were a French civilian in 1938 and you spent all of your assets paying off all of your debt, you made an absolutely terrible decision.  You could have used your money to buy your way out of the country and/or buy arms for defense.

Yes: It solves the systemic problem of the banking industry.  Right now, almost all of the money in the world is concentrated in the hands of a small number of people and corporations in the "financial services" industry.  Even if your money is in your bank account, really it is they who have control over it.  If you want to transfer it, you need their permission.  Bitcoin is a mechanism to give the money back to the people *directly*.  Without something like this, megabanks will just get more money and more political influence until they strangle society.

@_date: 2013-03-29 16:35:46
I really think this does provide something new.  It allows us to cut out the middle men in the financial sector, and we are finding out more and more that these middle men might not have our best interests at heart.  Anything banks can do to make more money, they will do, and since they already have most of the money it is very easy for them to find ways to accomplish this.  How successful have they been? Globally, the banking system has around 100 trillion dollars in assets, far more than the GDP of the entire planet (
Do banks provide some benefit to society? Well, yes, but I would vastly prefer to see them have much less power than they currently do.  I used to work at a bank (low point in my life), and I can tell you from the inside that their status quo was charging customers exorbitant fees for reasons that were difficult to explain, and offering banking "products" that nobody needed.  Employees worked on commission selling CD accounts to confused old people at interest rates far lower than the inflation rate of the dollar.  It was disgusting.  I asked other people who worked there if they ever felt unethical, and they all said it definitely felt wrong but they needed the money.  If we can take personal control of the money supply then *we* will have the money, not the banks.  Transferring money via bitcoin has practically no fees, and is practically instantaneous.  You don't have to deal with anyone taking a cut, and you don't have to deal with the "yes, the bank has received the money, but we are going to hold it for two business days before you can use it".  
As to your other points: Bitcoin is very up front about the way bitcoin works, so it is well known that it doesn't have perfect anonymity.  This doesn't bother me for two reasons: First, obviously none of the electronic banking alternatives offer anonymity either, and your bank will happily provide information on your activity to the government.  Second, we shouldn't be promoting bitcoin for illegal uses anyway.  
The exchanges, I agree, are a pain in the ass.  But I have a lot of faith that, as the system expands and the number of users grows, there will be faster and more accessible ways of exchanging fiat and bitcoin.  There is a lot of demand for this infrastructure, and that demand should eventually create something better than what we have now.
As for fraud, this is the price that we pay for having personal control of our money.  The cost of cutting out the middle man is that we now have to be responsible for the money ourselves.  We need to be careful with our wallets, and about who we do business with.  This is a huge difference from the society we have now, where we are essentially taught to be careless and nonchalant with how we use money, and it shows.  I am willing to pay the price of personal responsibility to keep my money out of the hands of a banking industry that provides me no benefit, and it looks like a lot of other people are too.

Most of my non-bitcoin savings are in technology stocks that I expect to increase substantially in the next few years.  Recently I've put a bunch of money into the solar industry because of the unbelievable pace at which the price-per-watt is coming down.

@_date: 2013-09-13 03:56:09
This is interesting, but people are always saying bitcoin is "just like digital cash", and unsurprisingly, bitcoin will have a lot of these same costs.  If you're going to complain about the cost of the 5.6 hours a year you spend getting cash, you also have to consider the amount of time and effort it takes to obtain and deal with bitcoins.  I assure you, I've spent more than 5.6 hours this year dealing with exchanges, wallets, updating the bloody blockchain, etc.  Anyway, this all pales in comparison with the amount of "money" we waste urinating each year.
The largest monetary loss they're talking about here is tax evasion, and there are plenty of people on this forum who are excited about using bitcoin for: tax evasion.  So, let's try not to push a campaign for the end of paper money here.

I think one of the best things we can hope for is that the government doesn't react quickly enough to set anything like this up.  Even if they decided to do it, it would have to be done by committees, and they would argue about how it would be regulated, etc.  It would probably be years before implementation, and by then bitcoin would hopefully be too established to be uprooted in this way.

It may be both legal and the norm, but it is not fair.  It may seem like a small thing now because the bitcoin economy is small, but if it becomes a major player then there is the risk that bitcoin will become an international tax haven open to all.  If only the patriotic pay taxes we will see first-hand just how few patriots there really are, and it is a problem we are already facing.

OK, everyone is quick to hang Mt Gox up on the cross because we have a need to blame some entity other than bitcoin itself.  Cut them a little slack.

The amount of traffic increase they've had recently is something they couldn't possibly have planned for.

Look at who owns the money.  Even publicly traded companies often have a small number of people who own the majority of shares.
Also, it's worth pointing out that most of the people in the world cannot afford even a car, let alone a stake in the factory that produced it.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:31:40
A lot of the bitcoins are not available.  They could conceivably get a huge number, but there are a lot of people sitting on the bitcoins they have who won't sell them for anything.  Most of the bitcoin economy flows through the exchanges now, but as the bitcoin economy becomes established more of the money will flow through merchants and other businesses, and it will become harder and harder over time for a single entity to try and seize a large quantity of them no matter how rich they are.
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:53:19
As more people adopt it and more infrastructure for it develops the price will become less volatile.  Still, even when it becomes "stable", bitcoins will probably deflate forever because of the fixed supply.  If you think about it though, fiat currencies aren't perfectly stable either; the USD inflates and fluctuates between an inflation rate of 2-3% per year.  This is deemed "stable enough" for everyday transactions.

Listen: Bitcoin is only four years old, and these are all accusations you could have leveled against the internet when the internet was only four years old.  This is how the argument would run:
"It's not useful that you can transfer information over the internet, because practically nobody is connected to or uses the internet.  Digital information is inaccessible for most people, so once transmitted the only way to get the information out is to print it on paper.  Since paper is what we're currently using anyway, we may as well just stick with paper and forget the internet."
Of course there aren't a whole lot of people who accept bitcoins yet; just give it some freaking time.  Gold has been used as a store of wealth for thousands of years, and bitcoin can do things gold never could.  It can be transmitted as data almost instantly anywhere in the world, which conveniently saves on the time and money you would have to pay to ship the gold in an armored truck.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:07:10
Many artists, musicians and freelance writers/software developers realize that they can support themselves with bitcoin donations for their work.  The ease and low overhead with which this can be accomplished gives a lot of people the ability to transition something that might have been a hobby into a way to make a living, and startup companies will have an easy way to be funded by donations with low overhead.  Eventually middlemen like record labels and publishers will become less important, and end-users can pay creators directly for their work in an optional system.
If you think about what we have now, a lot of things of value are informational in nature, and could be replicated over the internet for free.  But if this happens, the creators of this value don't get paid for their work, so ridiculous paywall and DRM schemes are applied to make sure that you can't get the information for free.  This is really preventing the distribution of a lot of value that we could have, and is going to become more and more of a problem as more and more things of value are digital.  I think by 2020 we could be pushing towards a system where informational goods can be freely distributed, with a simple option to donate bitcoins to the people who worked to create it.  
Other things would change too, but this is the one I wanted to talk about.
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:51:25
Central banking is a bullshit ponzi scheme, and bitcoin is definitely the way to regain some measure of control over the system.  My biggest concern is, even with the recent rapid growth of bitcoin, we're still up against a system that controls 5 or 6 orders of magnitude more wealth, and has had decades to develop influence over existing legal systems.  There is going to be something of a fight, I believe.

The fact that the government *might* take some action to curtail bitcoin puts us in the position of perceiving ourselves in a hypothetical struggle with the government, but this mentality of the zero sum game is going to be what starts that conflict in the first place.  The best case scenario is that the government *doesn't* try to take down the bitcoin system, so let's all try not to be purposefully antagonistic towards the establishment.  We're not trying to completely replace the economy and take over the world here.  We're just trying to add a service that didn't exist before which will complement the existing system and hopefully provide benefits for all.
