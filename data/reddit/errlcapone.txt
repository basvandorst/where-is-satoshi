People in this thread should give advice. Why wouldn't you want to help out a fellow redditor
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:39:14
Ive been trying to do that but I dont have a second ID to use lol GDAX wants another form of identifcation. Even tho I gave my passport. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:58:10
Fuckin same boat. All my shit is on coinbase which by reading these threads seems like a terrible idea.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:04:13
You can yes, but it asks for another 2 forms of Identification and it wont accept mail as a form of address. Even though its from my bank.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:21:16
Well fuck me lol. I didnt put much in to begin with. Half my shit would be fpr the fee ��

Some people here  also have more experience and knowledge that others don't...

Segwit an app or a website? Ive been doing this all from Mobile.

I cant find gdax on canadian playstore.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:25:47
Can someone explain to me whats going on with the drop. Ive been following BTC for a couple years now, but I dont understand the coinbase "attack". Also I can't find Gemini on playstore (Canada). Ive only recently invested in BTC and LTC ($50 each). Should I pull it out of coinbase? Am I still losing money? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:22:08
Yeah its just confusing reading all these "pull out of coinbase find a new exchange". 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:31:30
You can buy on coinbase for $1 fee. Its the sending from coinbase fee that fucks you
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:08:55
Hodling my $50 worth ahahahabah
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:01:15
I don't understand the buying fee you guys talk about. The fee it said for me was $1. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:05:47
Moving it from coinbase to a wallet would cost fee's correct?
