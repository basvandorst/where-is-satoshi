The're arent any flaws with paper wallets, but fire damage is something you have to be concerned with with any solution.
The main issue with paper wallets is people making transactions with them but not sweeping the funds, which can lead to your change being sent to addresses you dont control.

If you dont know that sending your change back to your paper wallet works fine, you really shouldn't be giving advice on it.
Especially when your fact/s analogies are flat incorrect. Reusing paper wallets does not diminish the private keys.
The simple advice for you and anyone else is to simply to use the 'sweep' paper wallet function. Safe.

Paper wallets are perfectly safe, the safest actually. And you can use them many times if you want to.
Theres is no "partial spend" really, you spend the whole balance every time. It's a matter of where the change goes that you need to pay attention to. So make sure you send the change to yourself.
Reusing paper wallets doesnt reduce their security, its just that all those transactions are on the blockchain and you could be linked to them all at once. It's a potential privacy thing, not a password cracking thing.
The Bitcoin wiki was defaced by hardware interests and so you can no longer get any usable info from there; its a hardware wallet advertisement at this point.

@_date: 2019-07-06 03:54:06
I say yes absolutely split them up.
And keep some OFF hardware wallets. New attacks and vulnerabilities emerge on those things all the time.
A group of **non**-hd paper wallets is what i think is best.
Even when compromised, chances are bad actors will sweep paper wallets one by one, giving you a fair amount of time to notice and react.
You could even prepare a transaction that moves all the wallets to a backup location in one go. Say, when you trigger some 'panic button' or something.

There's a hardware industry that puts out information which leads logically to their products being the only sound solution, such as that paper wallets are obsolete. You fell for that.
Probably more paper wallets in use right now than hardware ones though really.
Look at the [Bitcoin wiki on paper wallets]( not long ago and then [compare it to now](
The notes for that change are:
    (Rewrote entire page to focus on the flaws and highly encourage people to not use paper wallet)
People do roll fully reviewed keys all the time, which you can do with open source. But you cant with off the shelf hardware wallets, not all the way.

Paper wallets are the most secure method, always have been.
Theres a hardware industry and they pay for and push their narrative, which is what you're reciting.
Trezors are just you trusting the trezor company with all your crypto without being able to verify security.
Hardware wallets are inherently unsafe. Easy to use though.
@_date: 2019-07-28 06:41:24
Well "security" is a vague term, and any address with a balance is already publicly known.

You're assuming you know their intentions. Besides, as you say, it's *their* guidlines, they can change them willy nilly.
The concern you're trolling for would be if the government made some law saying AJ couldnt post on Youtube or Paypal. THAT would be censorship to fight against.
**Respect Youtube's/ Paypal's property rights.** AJ doesnt have a rights to post on other peoples computers.

Say something like you believe AJ has a right to post on any website and, because he's AJ, he cant get kicked off by the owners. Otherwise, censorship.
What do you actually want?? The government to force Youtube and Paypal to host AJ stuff???
Seriously, is that what you want?
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:44:00
You also have the right to refuse service.  And AJ's financial content certainly was on Paypal's site, he was using their servers.
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:45:49

What i realize is that you dont understand that blockchains dont die. The Ethereum forks you mentioned are alive and well. I dunno if anyones mining them, but you can pick them up and go right now.
Yes, Poloniex handled it perfectly well, they get it. Every fork is a new chain, Poloniex understood and dealt with both etherum forks.

I would have thought the Winklevossesesss would have more understanding and nuance than to use the "winning chain" concept, as, there will be no "winner". Poloniex handled the Ethereum fork correctly, Coinbase failed bad. Didn't the Wincklevsososesses pay attention?
There will be 2 coins after any fork, contentious or not, 95% or not.
And even at 95%, the 5% coin would still be the 2nd largest crypto. Then, when it dawns on everyone holding the 95% coins that they already have just as many of the 5% coins, they'll probably want to claim them and not just ignore them.
**Blockchains never die.**
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:33:55
I like Tone for stock trading, but he's not actually technical, has shown lack of understanding forks.
Before the ETH fork he was talking about how the loosing chain dies necessarily. I cant tell if he's updated his understanding but he's still talking about "contentiousness", the "winning" chain, and that a fork will kill Bitcoin. I dont think he's a good source on this topic.

OP's topic is tx size, not privacy.
And change coming back to the same address in itself does not reduce security.
@_date: 2016-03-21 03:54:44
The balance is 0 now. 
Did you move the coins or did that first tx go through?
You might wanna check if you're not sure.

Maybe not, but they can regulate almost everything else.
@_date: 2016-03-22 12:12:46
An input to one address is an output from another, and youre confusing them.
The point is that when you send using a single output instead of several, you get a smaller tx size, and therefore lower fee.
Thats the point of all this.
@_date: 2016-03-02 12:21:56
This is the response I got for similar problems, probably the same auto-response everyone else gets.
`Hello and thank you for your message.`
`I understand your eagerness to enroll in our debit card program! Currently this soft roll-out is automated and something we are watching closely in order to maintain the highest standards with such a large, new feature.`
`We will continue to select users at random and deploy this feature in larger batches as the launch progresses. When the feature is enabled for your account, you will be notified with a pop-up window at login, which will also direct you through the debit card verification process.`
`Hang tight and we’ll get this shipped to you soon!`
I take it theyre "selecting users at random" to allow to use the feature? **Wasting our time like a MF** when they could just message the users they've selected before hand directly.

0.0001 or 4 cents works fine for me lately, confirms right away.
0.000147 is better statistically, but i havent noticed. If anything 0.0001 still gets confirmed by the 2nd block 90% of the time...15 minutes maybe

Well you cant now. You gotta coin-mix or tumble them and start fresh. Use coin control features first to verify that they actually are on the same key.
 Honestly though, unlesss you're like a trained spy or something you'll mess up somewhere and the coins will be linkable to you.

I'd be happy letting shit slide honestly if it pans out. Cryptsy could pay back the 13% over time, fair enough.
@_date: 2016-03-22 03:18:40
Your point is taken. Im not sure if using the terms 'inputs' and outputs is better though but ok, its more precise.
Reuse is more handy because its the same addr every time, you can recognize it by looking at it. And often i appreciate all my ins and outs in one place for a particular account so to speak. keeps track for me.
When privacy matters i do other stuff but just casually its easy to use the same address. Plus the vanity angle, i keep addresses with cool words in them ect.

Theyre about to take shitcoins to a whole new level baby!
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:23:08
Contentiousness doesnt matter. Replays will work after any hard fork.
I'd think that solutions like PeterTodd mentioned would be built into wallets and nodes, probably even before the fork.
A wallet like Jax might be handy since it could potentially split the coins for you and treat them like any other Alt-coin; You could just log in and see a new crypto with a balance ready to use.
I'd like that 
@_date: 2016-03-02 15:45:56
I looked closer and yeah, 0.0001 is getting confirmed in the next block 90% of the time. Thats my wallet default and that also matches my recent experience.
4 cents gets a simple tx confirmed in the next block, 0-30 minutes.
70 minute delays are if you only put 1-10 satoshi/ byte in fees. So maybe youre using an older wallet or have your fees set too low.
Update yo shit cuzz
@_date: 2016-03-02 10:31:26

@_date: 2016-03-21 03:36:16
You can use coin control features to move your balance to one address so that when you send it only uses 1 input and the tx is small.
Then you can have the change come back to that same address so that you dont start getting multiple inputs again. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 16:10:15
if you put the transaction out there it can confirm waaay later even if your wallet shows that it didnt go through.
Basically once you put a transaction out, it cannot be cancelled.
@_date: 2016-03-13 07:22:16
ooh nice!
Actually i remember traveling with encryption and seeing warnings at customs that encryption was considered munitions. So yah, we can assert that too!

@_date: 2016-03-21 23:03:21
No, it does "leak public keys".
It can be an indication of how many bitcoins you have and where you spend them.
@_date: 2016-03-21 23:06:17
yes thats good.
But if you had 1.3 bitcoins your change would go to two addresses unless you instruct otherwise.
Its the same point we're making; to put all your inputs into one address so any tx only uses that one input and not several.
@_date: 2016-03-22 12:33:33
Right, nobody said that.

By "possible" you should explain your random selection process.
And that it's more likely that youll spend 15 minutes attempting to sign up, and then another 30 minutes emailing customer support trying to figure out why you couldnt sign up at all let alone "in under 5 minutes" like you thought the guy from coinbase posted on reddit.
@_date: 2016-03-21 23:01:33
I was explaining an easy way to move disperate inputs into one address and keep them there for the sake of small tx size.
Reusing addresses is fine if you know when its appropriate. You can send all your change to a new address each time, but in practice reusing addresses is way more handy.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:10:17
Correct, but only when the new rules are being enforced. So actually you're incorrect, soft forks dont reject old rules.

I just think youre just incorrect on soft and hard forks. Orphan chains too.
And your fud comment is confused. "...best bet is go before the bug showed [up]..." Right! exactly, thats called the chain we're on now.
Maintaining the chain we're currently on as back up is the opposite of fud, it creates certainty, a robust proven chain. Soft fork patches are amateur-hour.

Explain what enforcement is.
@_date: 2016-03-21 10:15:41
Because you start getting a bunch of different change addresses as you make transactions. Then when you go to spend your coins your tx will draw from several addresses which makes the tx size is much larger, which makes tx fees higher.
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:05:58
Fee manipulation!
With such large miners they game the system by filling up the mempool with their own tx's knowing that they will likey mine the block and get their money back. Meanwhile everybody else pays higher fees and the miners profit excessively.
@_date: 2017-02-22 07:08:33
It's not that bad, if investors have full disclosure then its voluntary.
But of course if you buy in on one chain and it splits then you should be in on both chains.

Right. Coinbase has his bitcoins. If thats where he sent them.
Coinbase isnt even a wallet really, its an account so maybe they just havent gotten around to updating the balance he sees when he logs in.

Any full node can mine, node operators can upgrade whenever.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:55:40
oh, you missed the point.
Segwit can be activated by nodes and enforced by nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:58:06
Ok so it looks to me that we have the same technical understand but differ on user behaviors.
So even with 99% signaling and next to nothing hashing power the no-upgrade bitcoin and Segwit will split into 2 overlapping networks, despite the orphan issue, and continue. Since orphaned chains get replaced and not "orphanded out of existence" as you put it, It will still be there.
Bottom line is, the split chain may have next to zero value and no users, but it will be there. Call it dead if you want, but its there.
And imho its best to maintain the split chain as a backup in case of unexpected issues with the seg-wit. Always should have backup when updating software right?

Nah, the chain wont die and reorganization wont work in reality.
In reality any miner thats destroying coins will get singled out and his blocks rejected. This articles whole premise is based on a fix target, like we all just sit and watch. Well its a moving target, its intelligent, and it will do what it has to do to survive.
Besides there being no economic incentive for destroying coins, coin destroyers would have to compete with eachother, making it more and more difficult. And of course they'll realize they could actually be making money mining properly instead of wasting it on some short lived coin destruction attempt.
What we're going to end up with if any of these soft fork activate and become hard forks will be either 2 or 3 chains that live on a la ethereum classic.
Final answer: 3 chains

Sooner or later we'll realize that Forks-Are-Our-Friends and trigger the BU fork or SegWit ourselves.
Once they're on their own chain we can treat them like any other altcoin.
Since they really are parasitical, they will bail on their own chain, because its only a vehicle to attack core with.
None of these troll forks can survive on their own chains, and so thats where we need to position them.

Well, add the address he moved your coins to to your wallet, it would be called 'watch only' since you dont have the priv keys. Then if/when the coins move again you can see right away and to where. Also add a google alert for the address so google will notify you if it gets found on the innerwebs.
The trace part is tough but if he's noob he might put them up on some exchange, or maybe post the address online somewhere, like to receive funds or something. Anywhere the coins go that you can identify, make contact and explain, maybe theyll share his info to you.
Contact the real bockchain.info. Since he logged in to take your coins, so maybe his ip info and such could help.
Follow up on that blokechain.info or whatever scam site tricked you also.
Contact the block explorer sites, explain, and ask if anyone has searched the address your coins are at, only you and the scammer know the address so it'd be him most likely if so. They might be able to tell you his i.p. info or perhaps more.
Some coin mixers might return stolen bitcoins if you contact them soon enough. Sounds like he moved your coins through a mixer already but, ya know, try.
blockchain.info lets you add messages to transactions, you could send some sitoshis to him with some messages complimenting his hacking skills and asking for some of your coin back.
Its all long shot, dont expect to see your coins again bro. Ive lost to hackers myself, cryptsy. I know the pain.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:56:52
Well your keys and your wallet seed are different things.
I stick with the keys myself, so theres *zero* uncertainty about seed import compatibility across wallets.  
@_date: 2017-03-09 06:45:05
Sounds like you just want to prove me wrong vs. learning stuff. Explain enforcement to me, as you understand it, I'd like to know.
In one sentence, enforcement is the point after which the forgiving, no forking, mutually acceptable rules, soft fork stage is over, and conformance to the new-rules-only is in effect.
The new rules only enforcement creates a fork when a miner mines an old rules block. People on old rules keep making old blocks, new rules keep making new rule blocks, two chains.
Youre confusing orphans on the same rules where the longest chain replaces shorter ones. 'Orphans' on different rules will not replace each other based on longest chain, they only do that within their own rules, not between blockchains.
You see?, this is why we're trying to get to 95% before enforcement, so that when (when) the fork happens, it wont be a gruesome 50/50 two bitcoin battle, but one big bitcoin and one tiny bitcoin, that hopefully nobody mines or keeps going; "dies". 
Hard fork is the same process except its just straight up enforcement right now, fork now, new features now. No two rules period.
If we could get segwit features with a soft fork only, shit, we'd have had it months ago, we've been running segwit for months just not enforcing. 
Anyway dont bother proving me wrong, i wont accept it. Just prove what the truth is, i'll take that.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:42:52
Resend your coins to yourself with a high fee. Zap wallet command or something similar will clear pending txs and let you attempt the double spend.
You only need to send yourself enough coin to make the first transaction not have enough, you dont have to sweep it all necessarily
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:50:54
You absolutely can replay the tx's on the new chain.
BU history includes all Core history until the fork, if you have coins pre-fork you will have coins post fork. If you spend or receive post fork, and your transactions get erased by a convergence, you can simply resubmit the Tx and it'll go.
One risk is that the sender moves his coins faster than you can resubmit the Tx in which case the resubmitted Tx will fail and you'll be screwed.
Another risk is that you'll accidentally send coins on both chains.

If BU miners do reorganization attacks on us with empty blocks, cant we always replay our transactions over and over until the mining settles down?
And, do you estimate that BU miners can protect their chain and attack ours simultaneously?
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:13:47
Nope, they'll mine that bitch all day.
Only upgraded nodes will stop mining the old chain, Un-upgraded nodes reject segwit and keep mining the blocks they consider valid.
The longest chain stuff only applies when the miners are on the same rules. Different rules = Different chain

Well yeah, they tried that....didn't work. Actually it frustrated users, who then responded with the UASF and segwit adoption.
Now, we have segwit and the lightning network, plus bech32. So we can tx much cheaper now.
So no, that attack didnt work, and its way less likely to work in the future, the community has immunized itself you might say.
Plus we've got Bitmain swinging from the gallows pole for trying that dumb shit, doubtfull we'll see that same move again.

Which approach do you assess as being more definitive? Your wiki, or the blockchain?
Either way, you're talking about the Trezor companies' terminology for their particular product, im talking about running full node with Bitcoin Core.
Seems obvious at this point you're not running a full node though, so you will get information better suited for you from r/TREZOR
See:  and note that you pointed me to a trezor wiki and ive linked to the Bitcoin wiki.
good luck.
@_date: 2019-11-11 00:01:05
It's been talked about plenty. If they try that move those 2000 nodes will get banned forever by the legit node operators. That attack assumes the target wont react and coordinate, but we will.
Mike Belshe tried this during the 2x attempt, had all the money and motivation necessary, but he realized it wasn't working. The network updated. Belshe would have just ended up with his own little personal altcoin network all by his lonesome.
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:42:34
Theres no way around it. And actually its an invalid concept youre speaking of because the Bitcoin is immutable, you cant change anything.
You can stay on the current chain, and you can start/join another chain with rules you like better. Those are the options, you can choose either or both.

**Segwit softfork gives us literally zero new features.**
Segwit requires a hard fork to activate!
How do you retards read these threads for so long and not get that yet.
BU is a soft fork just like Segwit, until activation. Then fork.
If you dont want the fork, then we stick with what we've got or fire up an alt coin. 
At this point im ready to ban this topic. Go make a scaling debate sub-reddit ffs.

well, Segwit considers non segwit transactions as valid. 
But yes its exactly true that SegWit creates a fork. So many people dont get this yet.
A soft fork is really just like saying "Hey we're gonna hard fork soon". Nothing changes, you dont get any new features with a soft fork. 
Once the soft fork enforces the new rules, its not a soft fork anymore, its a hard fork, and we get two chains.

If you have access to all the seeds you have access to all the wallets everywhere in this scenario, multisig and otherwise.
If i wanted to make a 2 of 3 multisig with 3 trezors i would get one unused public address from each trezor and with Bitcoin core make the multisig address using those addresses.

I dont need to be technical to present a valid argument, basic logic there.
You're argument is in the political style, not so much an attempt to come to an objective truth, but rather to win in the moment. Cherry picking what to respond to, refusing to answer the obvious questions, ect.
Your attack fails because its designed on the flawed assumption that there would be no reaction by the network participants.

Thank you for the article and the graphics.
How do you enforce a soft fork without the rejected blocks and miners from just continuing on?
And if you have an answer, why arent we just doing that right now? lets have segwit features and no fork right now?!
Softforks are compatible because they dont reject non conforming blocks, So again, how do you reject blocks but not have them continue? economic incentive? everyone playing nice?

Obviously you're not plotting your adversaries moves what so ever, you seem to be unable to. Or you think there would be no reaction at all. Either case makes you insignificant as an attacker.
 In my estimation, the network would indeed react, quickly, and become much stronger than it was before the attack. And I think you'd end up in the hands of gangsters or in jail.
Im not technical, so exhausting my technical replies doesn't make your attack plan valid. You need to plot out the back and forth, or just prove it though a successful attack. So i call.

I think i'd much rather the wiki be agenda free and focus on factual information that paper wallet users can rely on. Its akin to an encyclopedia entry, not an editorial opinion piece. The current version is fully opinion. I need information on how paper wallets work, i dont want belchers personal opinion, even if his friends agree.
To me, showing a crumpled up water soaked paper wallet is borderline ethically. Why doesn't the hardware wallet tab show a broken smashed and melted Trezor? Obviously that would be nonsense. The paper wallet wiki is currently nonsense.
Ultimately, the most important aspect to Bitcoin is personal responsibility, especially related to key management. Is buying your private keys on custom hardware from the internet, delivered by random guy, really the direction to push noobs? I dont think so.
Yes, i want to see all the pitfalls, and, the best practices of paper wallet use. Trying to nanny newcomers is a slippery slope, especially when the agenda is to use fear to motivate them. Let the facts do it.
The noob who has interest to learn about paper wallets is waaaaay better off than the noob who takes up a trezor. The paper wallet user can generate her own keys, knows about seeds, change addresses, bips, offline storage, tails os, full nodes, all the good shit!
Pushing newbs to hardware is dangerous and lazy and we'll end up with masses of ignorant users on proprietary hardware.

So far so good with Nexo. Salt lending sucked miserably, but i like the nexo platform, terms are pretty good.
Edit: The only catch is that you cant directly repay the interest with nexo tokens yet, but if you hold nexo with them it reduces your interest rate. They say eventually you'll be able to repay with nexo once theres more liquidity on exchanges.

Those are probably change addresses or receive addresses you havent used yet; but yeah each will have a priv key.
looking closer, or using coin control features, you can see which have any coin in them. Those are the ones i save the keys to.
Being familiar with how change works is a big step in security. It's very easy to loose money when change from a tx goes to a new address.

I see alot of new to bitcoin people wanting to start off with their full investment. I think thats bad.
Buy small amounts and play around with it fearlessly. Then once you know what youre actually doing, buy more and secure it.
Having poorly protected bitcoins laying around is actually a pretty good way to get early detection when youve been compromised....small eggs, more baskets.
And finally I put more stock into physical security than digital security, like a lockbox a hole and a treasure map is probably safer than a trezor imho

Yes, always sweep the wallet. 
And very importantly sweep the whole balance. Sweeping implies taking the whole balance but the point is to do just that, do not leave change on a paper wallet it may become lost forever.
I think most cell or online wallets will sweep if you point them at a private key qr
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:11:41
Nothing online is safe.
But theres no sure thing anywhere either. You have to manage the security.
Each type of wallet has its strengths and weaknesses. 
So you have to choose based on what works for you and your situation.
Basically if its online everyone with a connection can take a stab at it. If its offline then they need physical presence, which reduces the number of possible stabs so to speak.

Paper wallets aren't by definition web wallets, they can be though. I believe paper wallets to be the safest.
The criticisms of paper wallets are all related to user error, not the format itself.
When you get advice about HD wallets, rarely do you get the dangers of their private keys being combined in a way that unlocks ALL off your inputs, even ones you haven't made yet!
Also, there's is a hardware wallet industry that wants to scare you away from the open source, knowledge based options such as paper wallets. They'd have you buy your private keys from them, like with Ledger Nano ect.
Best bet is to learn how to make and manage your own keys. No expert at any level will disagree with that.

I'd say youre doing it wrong. Forget Par2, you're not downloading torrents here, doesnt make sense.
1000 copies of your wallet backup is far safer than 1 copy + 1 set of par files. If anything, duplicate your backup and your par files onto the DVD till its full.

multisig is a single address from my experience. Each individual address could belong to its own seed or be 2 or all three from the same seed.
Then to spend from the multisig you either import the required private keys to one wallet, or the required number sign the transaction separately.
All you need is the private keys for the multisig address, but the seeds can generate them. The seed will open up your entire wallet though.
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:53:56

Maybe make a txt file and copy/paste the keys in there a few hundred times, then make a few hundred copies of that file, then burn them on the disc.

I understand par 2 fine, qr code redundancy as well. Same situation; a paper wallet with one qr code is more likely to decay than a wallet with the qr printed on it 100 times. Theres a limit to how much par2, or qr codes, can repair.
With your approach one good scartch on a dvd and your wallet is likey gone, par2 or not.
Again, with 1000 copies on whatever medium your using, you assume there is decay and loss, and that between your 1000 copies you'll have a good one.
Bringing your keys onto a computer makes them hot. And you should be able to store your keys unattended for years. If you need to verify them every few months something is not right.

@_date: 2017-08-07 08:11:10
Impressive, but uh, dude just move your BTC to another address.
The BCH wont move because of replay protection, And so you can safely use the original keys from your old BTC address as it wont have any real BTC on it anymore, but will have your BCH.
Then install BCH wallet on some other machine and import your original keys which only have BCH on them.

If you have the private key you have all options available to you.

You make very weak arguments. There are people who use bitcoin as currency, so you're wrong, its that simple.

Im guessing youre a gold &amp; silver coin guy, which is funny because thats not used as currency these days either, has no fundamental value, and could go to zero at any time.
If i understand you though, government backing = fundamental value. But thats just another one of your super weak arguments.

It probably feels like youre making a point, but youre not. Youre just arguing about what your opinion of 'slim' is. Factually speaking, Bitcoin is now, and always has been, used as a currency.
Bitcoin cannot go to zero. Thats another fact. Its very easy to say that because i myself will personally buy them all at a price above zero. Cant go to zero.

But, CSW did slight of hand trickery and forged that process. So yes ultimately you can never prove a negative, but when you have a failed forgery, we can know he's lying. Vitalik called him out on it in epic fashion

You missed the "promise" part. Bitcoin doesnt promise any of the things you mentioned. And by worth it means like redemption, a slip of paper with a promise written on it that it's worth some other thing, like silver.
@_date: 2019-08-17 19:44:43
Youve got it correct. Except, thats not address reuse what you did there.
Reuse in this case would be if you sent the change back to either A or B address, or if theres some coin left on either after the transaction, or if you use A or B to receive again in the future.

Interesting question.
if the moon is 239,000 miles away, and light travels at 186,000 miles per second, then you could mine on the moon with only a 2.4 second disadvantage to send and receive.
Mars is about 3min of lightspeed away and seems like that would be too far away to send blocks back and forth competitively
So its funny that mining on the moon is about as far away as you could mine on this chain without too much disadvantage.

As in, there are people willing to buy Bitcoin and there are people willing to sell Bitcoin. Those people individually decide at what price they are willing to buy or sell.

Lay off that Molyneux, shit has you trippin holmes.


You know a fact from an opinion or an assertion right??? Because Ancap is not in the Blockchain, it easily could have been.

Of course an ancap can employ copy restriction, he just wouldn't rely on the state to do so.  Stephan Kinsella's argument is from a libertarian position, not an ancap one. 
Technology isnt economics; the wheel is tech but not economics. Naturally, you can make economic technology, but technology isnt necessarily economics.
You're not even making sense with *"The only capitalist form of code is free software."* If you have a point here please use Adobe Photoshop as an example for me. 
I dont estimate ancaps at all, i take them at face value and don't care one way or the other.
Again you're not making sense, let alone a point, by saying SJW's have infected firefox. Maybe you've got some political baggage to sort out.
i'd hear out an argument about why Bitcoin isnt cypherpunk but actually ancap. Lay it on me, lets not get caught in the weeds here.

Sure they would, if an ancap writes software he considers it his private property. He'd sell it, and restrict its unauthorized use or access (theft as they'd see it)
The Cypherpunk doesnt recognize intellectual property as such, they openly acknowledge contributors and authors, but not ownership.


I suppose, but technology isnt economics and thus the Cypherpunks give their work out for free and frown on proprietary code.
Something like internet explorer vs. Firefox

Plenty difference, but there is overlap between them.
Ancaps can exist entirely without technology and tend toward conservative ideology, the strong individualist values and faith in the free market.
Cypherpunks are all about technology and have a strong social aspect, they code open source and for free, and aim to liberate information.

Agree about Tone Vays; great analyst, so-so technologist.
Yeah Omit OP's step one, but remember: Youre doxxing yourself with this approach by sending from coinbase to your private keys.
Double spending to yourself will probably be the simple coin splitting route given one chain will be moving faster and will have lower fees. Basically sending yourself a low fee tx will work much faster on one chain than the other, giving you plenty of time to double spend safely. No doxing, and simpler than nLock transactions.

Well im certainly disagreeable, but you've got your own definitions of capitalism, ancap, and cypherpunk. So theres really no room here.
A more facts based argument would be for me to just site the cypherpunk events listed in this OP, and the lack of ancap anywhere. Then assertthat youve got no sources that support your ancap argument.
Basically cypherpunk is right there on the timeline, ancap/ anti SJW, is your own injection.

It would be invalidated if it gets mined and it uses all the coins . If your address still has enough balance the other Tx will still be valid and could get mined at any point.

Thank you, i can work with this.
On first site though you haven't linked any legal sources. Snopes and the washing post mean ill be reading some journalists opinion, but lets see..
I'll check your info and come back with the verdict. Stay tuned.
Edit: i found the *valid* sources 
and also 
in case you want to follow along...
2nd Edit: Yeah no, its not there. Search the law for 'pronoun', zero hits. I read it though. Basically if you're doing business in nyc you can't call people "nigger" while at work. Or any other not-their-name word that is offensive. The rest of the time, offend away!
I can see your misunderstanding comes from you getting your info word of mouth or through journalists and home made wikis. You gotta check shit for yourself bro, find the *definitive sources*, and separate your hard core right wing beliefs from the actual laws.
By all means *site the law* where im wrong, instant points scored.

I believe they said theyll be going with the fork and afterward your balance will be withdrawable as classic. even if you deposited core....bit of a rip off if you ask me.
Im sure they would be forking the coins themselves and selling them or using them somehow. But probably not making that as public

Huh? im an artist and obviously you've never commissioned artwork.
When you hire an artist to produce art for your purpose, you can tell them if they've achieved your goal or not. But when an artist makes his own art, you've got no place to tell him it should be this way or that way. Like you did, or *did* you hire him to produce artwork that would "...attract new money to the space" and meet all your other objectives?

LOL nice link, it reiterates exactly what im saying.
*"-zapwallettxes cleared unconfirmed transactions from your wallet and YOUR MEMPOOL. Other nodes still have your unconfirmed transactions in their mempools, and they may get confirmed eventually!"*
Practically my words exactly.
'Inputs cannot be reused', yes correct. And as long as there is enough balance (input) at the sending address to cover both transactions, eventually both will confirm. Your case works if the sender only has enough input to cover the first transaction, in that case the second is rejected as a double spend.
 You really dont understand this??
Lets bet bitcoin on this aye?
edit: **You say youve tested this? tx or stfu.**
Heres me testing it ages ago: txid: *0591375c43b083bedeee074a61491357f8abfbd7037c6a7bd08d638ae5ec2190*

I enjoy thinking about how far down the rabbit hole goes security wise. It gets crazy paranoid but its fun.
I think that even if your shit is secure they could still sus you out, especially over time. And unless the person youre doing business with is james bond level incognito himself, that person's lack of security could reveal you and your business.

Well lets say you had 1 btc and you sent a no fee tx to someone for 0.3 bitcoin. It sat there for a long time so you used -zapwallettxes and sent it again with a higher fee.
That second tx would get confirmed right away and subtract 0.3btc from you. But eventually the first tx would get confirmed and take another 0.3btc.
So thats not really a double spend, its a double pay.

Double spending is a well known phenomenon, its not depending on when i consider a payment finalized.
The key ingredients are submitting multiple Tx's using the same uxto, with one Tx that sends the coins to yourself, the other that becomes invalid, and leaving someone ripped off.
The Double spend.
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:39:42
Yes. You can "fee boost" a transaction right back into your wallet. And its "opt-in" which means its on by default, duh.
Does the Core wallet even alert if it actually sees reused inputs? Seems like a 'double spend detected' flag should be part of this for sure.

Block cypher is using the term the way everyone else is. They are technical and have been in the space for years. 
You're a random guy on reddit with your own unique definition of double spend. Sure, you have a valid definition, its just not exclusive to the other valid definitions and puts you into pedantic land arguing it.
@_date: 2019-04-28 07:07:24
You're both pedantic and incorrect. Youre siting the white paper, not the actual technology. You are referring to text, not network behavior. And the text you are referring to isnt even the current version of bitcoin we're running.
Look, here's Peter Todd one of the most respected bitcoin core devs in an article explaining how he "double spent" at coinbase.
If you're saying that you're correct and everyone else, core devs, block explorers, experienced users, are all incorrect, then theres no use talking to you, you're on a personal tangent.
The Bcash "but muh white paper" argument wont cut it.

No it will not necessarily discard the first tx, As long as you have the balance both transactions will get sent. You could pay twice that way.
I would use the -zapwallettxes command then send my entire balance to myself at a new address including a relatively high fee so it gets picked up fast.
Then resend your original payment, but with a typical mining fee, all should be fine.

6 inputs and 2 outputs is more than usual. Plus they're legacy format addresses and youve even got a multisig as one of the outputs.
You can try dragging the transaction threw by sending some of the coins you received to yourself with a high fee (even if you havent received the coins yet) . You'd need a wallet with coin control features like bitcoin core to do that.

i think your view on double spending is too narrow technically, it doesnt match how the term has been or is being used. Look at this random Tx  this block explorer is scanning the mem pool for "double spends" meaning multiple tx's using the same uxto.

You could use RBF to rip someone off by not including a fee when you spend the first time, then replace the tx with your own address and a higher fee.

What you're saying works, I agree.
And yes addresses do not become invalid in forked blocked, Agreed.
My technique is to send coin to an address in a forked block. That address will necessarily have a balance different than in Core, and so the tx will be rejected by core.
At the same time however, Classic will accept the tx because its perfectly in accordance with its blockchain. And there's the split.
Essentially Id be getting confirmed on the classic fork by sending, not by receiving.
A custom change address might even let me fork coins in one step.
[Edit] I take your point that core will consider the first tx as valid. I do think that Core would reject it but maybe not i'll look into it.

@_date: 2016-02-06 21:22:27
Ok i see what youre saying, and we ultimately are agreeing. 
However, I'm proposing to acheive the taint by making a tx that will be rejected outright by core but confirmed by Classic.
I'm wanting to do it this way so that I can fork my coins under my own power, right away, without having to buy Classic or use luck, or speedy double spend....I want the sure thing.
Since by definition a forked block is tainted, (if its not tainted its not really forked) when i send a satoshi to an address in a forked block, my whole balance goes there and my change, minus the satoshi and fee, comes back, as tx's do. Thats in Classic. But Core will just reject the transaction as invalid and my core coins wont even move.
Then I would have  balances on each chain, different only by the one satoshi and the mining fee.
At that point they would still be using the same pub/priv keys so I would send the entire larger balance (Core) to myself at a new address. This tx would work fine and move the Core coins but the Classic would reject the tx because of insufficient coins, and the Classic coins would stay put.
Presto! I have both balances and now they are at unique addresses and easy to handle.
Any bunk in there?
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:03:09

@_date: 2016-02-08 02:09:17
I think just separating your coins on each block into unique address is the best way to profit. 
But you could also charge people to taint their coins. As in, if you have some forked coins, you can charge people a dollar or whatever for you to send a forked satoshi to their core address. This would taint their coins and allow them to separate, or double,  them into accounts on each chain.
Could be set up alot like shape-shift.

Most likely he's been compromised, because yeah, how?
But the story goes that Craig did some bullshit on his laptop and Gavin watched, and based off that, Gavin believes Craig is Satoshi.
Thankfully, the devs reacted promptly and retired Gavins commit access. Gavin started coding fork chains after that, now he's nothing.

You'd have the OP pay twice with your approach. This is just a matter of fact, no point arguing over it. Try it.
And technically the tx would be valid even on a double spend, it just wont confirm.

They hold your crypto while you are borrowing. They let you withdraw as a loan about 50% of your crypto collateral, you can borrow little by little or all at once.
But it seems like if you use their nexo tokens as collateral you can only borrow about 33% of the nexo value.
Their interface does a good job of showing you your loan amount and the interest and all that.

ok so 100% of paedos are white and 20% of groomers are white. You can see that for some reason youre focusing on race here right??
Sane people dont care about the race of paedos, or "groomers" either whatever the fuck a groomer is.
Think of it this way, if your enot racist, deal with that 100% of white paedos, since, im assuming you're in the white community there and have some inroads. I think you'll be much more effective. But i get it, race hating feels good on a certain level.

@_date: 2019-04-23 20:52:49
No Tx without a half dozen confirmations is safe.
Double spenders can also push their tx directly to miners so that each spend is considered 'first' by that miner. Some miners dont include multisig or segwit tx's and this also can be exploited as part of a double spend.

Well one way is that you make 5 paper wallets and then create a 3 of 5 multisig address using those addresses.
To access the funds you would import any three of the paper wallets, and then the multisig address would become available to you. (it feels like magic when you see it)
i'd use bitcoin core to do it myself. 
Edit: Hardware wallets might be tricky because you usually cant access the private keys directly and might have problems getting all 3 keys into one wallet. You could make the multisig with the hardware wallet addresses easily, but getting the funds out... well, id test it first.

Avoid vendor lockout completely by avoiding vendors. Be like Satoshi, use a paper wallet.
Private keys will necessarily work forever. They can be put into many formats, but the key itself is just a number.
Have that number and you have your crypto.
EDIT: I disagree with u/igadjeed 's approach, personally. With HD wallets you run into the derivation path issue again, which is what youre asking how to avoid. That, and if someone gets a couple of your HD keys, they can back out the seed and sweep all of the one million keys you burned onto that dvd.

i must say im impressed that you'd concede the point. Good on you for being reasonable. 
The point is that this is a bitcoin forum and JP has never even said the word bitcoin, which is a strong indication that this thread is off topic and shouldnt be here. It should be on r/politcs or r/jordanpeterson.
Im all for you guys talking about free speech and whatever else you like, but please, go away from here unless youre talking about bitcoin. That was the point with all of that.

These are not equal and opposite terms and its easy to prove. Look for alt-right groups self identifying as such and you'll find them loud and proud in no time.
Look for leftist marxist groups and you wont find any anywhere, its purely a pejorative used by the alt-right.
Big difference

You're all over the place and suck at argument and critical thinking. If youve never even heard of the 'alt-white' youre too ignorant in this subject matter to debate this.
You said it yourself you see the alt-right groups but you just dont think theyre mainstream or have power. But theyre out there, obviously, which is my point.
When you googled the *WORD* Marxist  you got 47 million results, no suprise. The argument though is about finding "self identifying leftist marxists groups" and you found 0 of them. You found 0.
Nothing personal, but youre not really at my level and id like more intelligent exchange.

Right, they call themselves **"Socialists"**. They do not call themselves "leftists Marxists". You're not able to differentiate the two, and i see that now. The concept of self identification is lost on you.
Ive proven easily that the alt-right is real and those group self identify as such. Self identifying "Leftist Marxist" groups do not exists and you havent shown anything to the contrary.
So its clear the right and alt-right are just name calling. You're just name calling.
Alt-Right is not fringe, you want to see a dozen links to mainstream sources? I'll just let you redefine this into something subjective so you can feel like you have a point. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 23:31:03

If they switch, your Bitcoin balance will be gone from the wallet. They'll give you 2xCoins of the same amount instead.
Then when you move your 2xCoins from Exodus, the real Bitcoins that you still have, but that Exodus wouldnt show you, get moved too and then you dont have them anymore and cant recover them.
They'd fuck you out of your whole stash man. You cant just leave your coins with them.

r/btc has almost identical reasoning they do and the same exact same cries of censorship and unjust treatment. That and they're in an ALTernate universe with their ALTernate facts. its a perfect match.

yes it does. It shows us that the issue is racism and not paedos. If it were just protecting kids, race would not be an issue, not even a little.
They want to push immigrants out, and so they demonize them with really scary propaganda, while claiming to be victims.
Simple test: imagine someone damages your kid; to what extent do you care about that persons race or religion? zero. zero. they can fry regardless.
check your morals.
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:04:28
Not to mention, they have partnership with Bitmain...so they have direct access to block inclusion for their transactions. 
If Bitmain has invested in them, isnt it obvious that that investment would be lower fees for block inclusion? which would give Bitpay an edge in the market, and thus more business, more profits, and ultimately more value to Bitmains equity in them?
That, or its just a way to shoe horn Bcash into the payment processing scene.

Trevon is no different than anyone else. He tried out bitconnect, warned everyone that he's not giving out investment advice, and lost his money right along with the rest of you.

Oh **every 2x exchange will have replay protection 100% for sure.** 
For the simple reason that if they don't protect *themselves* we can easily split our 2xcoins, deposit them into any 2x exchange, and withdraw coins on BOTH chains! then repeat.
It worked like a charm when Coinbase tried to ignore eth classic. Lotta free money they handed out. good times
So, when everybody sees the 2x exchanges take customers bitcoins and switch them with 2xcoins, then protect themselves from replay, but not customers, they're going to look rather criminal as they hold all them stolen bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:17:11

Yes this is the plan. They will take everyone's bitcoins, get caught, then delay as long as possible. Years later they repay, they'll repay in USD the amount at the time of the fork, just to the people who are in the class action.
This little move would probably be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in a few years.

If you have bitcoins you should have a node. Your node is how you access the blockchain and your bitcoins. 
If you dont run a node youre only asking someone else for their permission to access your bitcoins, to which they can tell you no.

Trevon was a victim like everyone else. Youtube itself pulled more people into the scam than anyone else, by a vast margin.
I imagine you're out for justice and making an example out of *somebody* would feel good.
But if the FBI was going to do anything it would be to find the real people behind bitconnect, not Treyvon and nick the low level kids on youtube.
Edit: Your FBI resource shortage excuse doesnt hold. Here, google "use my bitconnect referral" and you'll find 90% of the referral link criminals. Done. Bookem' Danny.

So thats your case? thats it? He said "You gotta do things to get ahead" ???? I'm just not feeling it man.
He's a youtube star before bitconnect, so yes referrals were way more worth it than the loans for his time.
Speak to personal responsibility; because youll get nothing chasing after trevon.
Follow the money and go after Youtube, they were the ones running the huge commercials that brought the most people into the scam. They were the ones putting Trevon vids out as well. Shit, 100% of Trey's referral links came straight off Youtube.com directly.

Its like with fax machines, having 200 fax machines in your office doesnt add any value past having just one. But 200 different households with 1 fax machine in each does add value.

It makes a complete 100% difference. Nodes determine what a Bitcoin is. If you are going to accept payment, with a full node you'll know payment is valid, without a node you'll get scammed.

You dont run a node huh? We dont use etymological anything, we verify using the consensus rules (math).

@_date: 2017-10-19 18:21:34
We're betting on who's going to win. Thats the bet.
They're claiming 90% of hash power, so to use your analogy, it means theyre already on the track, at the starting que, and just waiting for the gates to open.
So if nobody is betting on B2x, its cause its a looser.

@_date: 2017-10-11 15:42:35
Right, tricking Coinbase users into accidentally buying your coin is a great plan. Look at Xapo customers! cutting up their cards bruh. 
Bitfinx is selling chain split tokens, its a real market and B2x is selling for like 20% of Bitcoins, and dropping.
UASF got exactly what it wanted, when it wanted it. Jihan got....Bcash. Call that whatever you want.
Listen, your little make believe 90% number isnt even real. Miners arent even running B2x nodes themselves. Mining pools and companies are dropping out day by day, face it, 2x is falling apart.
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:58:02
Miners arent people, theyre machines. They have no seat at the development table. They get a rack in a closet or something, a/c if they're lucky.
Miners not acting right? throw them away and replace them with better ones. Nothing personal.
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:27:42
yeah if you have Bitcoins, run a node. You could do some lightweight usb mining too, its easy.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:51:24
I'm by no means a lawer but its seems like  conspiracy to defraud and even some RICO style racketeering.
They're deploying nodes in disguise that will connect to and negatively impact our computers/ nodes/ finances.
    *"Racketeering, often associated with organized crime, is the act of offering of*
    *a dishonest service (a "racket") to solve a problem that wouldn't otherwise exist*
    *without the enterprise offering the service."*
This whole scaling debate, the spam transactions, the empty blocks, and the big-block 'solution' certainly seem to fit the description to me.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:59:44
Listen scammer, You know your Open Bazarr project will have users who loose to 2x replay attack and your over here deflecting that fact with name calling and argumentation points of order.

@_date: 2018-02-21 05:09:28

@_date: 2017-10-01 07:26:07
We can drain any S2x only exchange's Bitcoin if they fail to separate the coins.
Split your coins, deposit 2x coins into a 2x only exchange, withdraw and coins will be on both chains.
If the 2x exchanges have replay protection, then no loss, and its straight up obvious theyre intentionally stealing bitcoin. 
If they stay hands off and claim to just be following the longest chain then fine, take all the bitcoin they have.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:11:17
Well users can upgrade their software to counter hardware attacks. Bitcoin users wont just sit still and let really bad things happen to their finances like that.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:32:58
Fine. Blame the negros.
You'll get all your money back that way and you can continue to invest in ponzi scams risk free.
Not only that, it will teach everyone a lesson and there wont be anymore referral links or exit scams.
And since it was an obvious scam, then Youtube is the most responsible next to Bitconnect. Because it was obviously a scam and so Youtube knew it was a scam, and they hosted trevon vids, and ran commercials for bitconnect, knowing it was a scam, and intentionally doing crime...
Just like trevon and craig right?

What if my answer is "i do them often actually"? Then youre reckd right?
But my personal use doesnt matter. We're talking about currently valid technology. Conceed, you'll actually look smarter.


Thus i point out lightning. Bitcoin does have that capacity. You reply by asking me my personal use? This is over.
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:23:38
You probably need a full node to actually do this protection. I would anyway.
Seems like they intentionally chose this method because none of the spv wallets im familiar with let you tailor a transaction in such a way. 
Since the people they want to dupe are the spv wallet users, and those wallets wont let you use this protection, It's obvious that this non-protection is just a a farse, a gas-lighting technique.
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:12:15

Well lightning works now, just not much of a network yet right?
Explain how a loss of funds can occur if you would please; it doesnt sound correct. Lotta fud going around.
If we open up lightning channels before the fork it seems to me that we can use lightning to transact until hash power/ block time gets sorted.

No, they were from new bcash UXTO's. Easily confused, but entirely distinguishable, from my old Bitcoin UXTO's.
Might be more accurate to say I got my bcash when bcash was invented. My bitcoin keys matched my bcash keys, and there were UXTO's associated with those keys on the bcash block chain.

Who's going to buy those out of consensus blocks? The market doesnt have much interest in them f.y.i.
Meanwhile you've got 10,000 nodes with a bounty out on Bitcoin blocks. The market is there. The users are there. The best developers in the world, there.
We've seen jihan engage in game theory vs. UASF; bitch-slapped. Bring it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:42:57
Miners software determines what they're hashing. If they were really going to mine B2x they would be running that node software. We dont have to take them seriously until they're actually running the B2x. 
Miners cant mine B2x blocks while running core.
"Rouge nodes" as you put it wont make a difference for them. They need real users to have a network, thousands of cloud nodes wont help there.

Im UASF since the beginning and im happy with the victory we accomplished.
I dont buy into the "economic nodes" theroy or put weight into the "they can just spin up a million nodes" line either.
Regular node guys sending their balance to themselves is way more economic activity than coinbase does. Doing so with high mining fees is more miner incentive as well. And its within our own power, running full nodes, to do those things.
Actually you agree with the r/btc crowd right?: UASF did nothing, non-mining nodes dont matter, whitepaper satoshis vision, only economic nodes matter, we should mine at a loss which wont work but we should do it anyway, and we should lobby (beg) coinbase and shapeshift and jihan wu, cause thats the only thing that will actually work.

Sounds like valuation is your primary concern.
What vendor is going to accept 2xcoin but not Bitcoin? More like theyre going to keep accepting Bitcoin and not give any fucks about 2xcoin.
I think Jihans ASICBOOST days are done, and Shapeshifts clock is ticking with atomic swap tech coming on line. And those are the reasons why theyre 'going for it' now despite all common sense.

Im serious, this is how you do the 2x opt-in replay protection. You gotta include jeffs bitcoin address in every transaction you want protected.
SPV wallet users are probably fucked, but this is how you do it with a full node.
You click the 'add recipient' button on the bottom of the send page, then put in Jeff's wallet address, *3Bit1xA4apyzgmFNT2k8Pvnd6zb6TnwcTi* You'll have to pay extra in fees for Jeff's protection, but whutcha gonna do right??

Well Exodus wallet is in the wishy-washy catagory. It's a spv wallet, closed source, and makes its money through E. Voorhees. The devs arent crystal clear about the fork either, so use alot of caution with Exodus.
Seed phrases are great but they wont protect wallets from replaying your transactions or switching chains on you. Sending coins to other people is when youre at risk of replays.

@_date: 2019-09-12 10:49:03
well that should be the same as making the address from the same wallet.
which would mean your wallet already controls the multisig without having to do anything else.
so any wallet built from that seed can access your multisig.

There's more to it than that.
Nodes can adjust how strict/ forgiving they are with errant nodes. The penalties can range from like ignore for an hour, up to ban permanently.
We can also adjust how many connections we allow, in and out. There's trusted peers we can use, we can make and share our own blacklists, we can connect to the network using tor. Lots of stuff.
So i'd like some guidance from more knowledgeable node ops about some settings to make it *real* tough for 2xcoins to fuck with our connectivity.

They're calling maintaining the Bitcoin chain a fork. And that an invalid blockchain is Bitcoin.
[A chain is valid if all of the blocks and transactions within it are valid](
The B2x chain isnt a valid bitcoin chain, regardless of how much work is put into it. 
They even link you [to the bitcoin wiki]( which says: *"The Bitcoin network has a global block difficulty.* **Valid** *blocks must have a hash below this target..."* 
Determining if a block is valid or not is 100% objective, its perfectly defined. Machines can do it. It's yes or no.
So Xapo is about to defraud its customers by applying a false identity to the B2x and Bitcoin blockchains.

Set up a full node, core 0.15, and get your coins off exchanges and spv (cell phone) wallets.
Ask your wallet devs which chain they'll follow. Long answers, no answers, wishy-washy, unclear, or unspecific answers mean theyre going to follow the 2x coin. 
Spv wallets are ok if you can point them at your own node. Or if the wallet devs are perfectly clear that they're No2x. Just showing you the private keys isnt enough to protect from loss.
Then split your dividend coins, bcash, 2xcoin, bgold, ect., off onto their own addresses. Then you good.

That, and with a known and set amount of Bitcoin in circulation, Im not worried about paper bitcoins at all. I'd even buy a little bit just to try them out.
Im more concerned that Coinbase doesnt have the bitcoin they say they do. I think thats why they list bcash, because they didnt have the Bitcoin they said they did and so couldnt deliver the Bcash. They listed it so they could play games and defer the bull shit. My theroy.

QR's are good and no doubt. But you cant decipher them without hardware and software, not realistically anyway, so its somewhat removed from you.
A more apples to apples comparison would be a qr code vs. the privkey written down several times on the same piece of paper. You'd get the same redundancy as qr but human readable.
if only a few numbers are damaged from a key you could crack it pretty quick to recover.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:34:23

Jeff Garzik, Why must we tie +2mb to Segwit? why cant +2mb get adopted based on its own merritt, and not as a hostage negotiation for the Segwit we want?
Some of us will not fork off at the +2mb stage anyway.

No, coinbase is not a wallet. Understanding that is critical in securing crypto.

It works if you run it. Despite all the complexities, it really is that simple.

This agreement means 2Mb and no segwit.
Segwit comes at 80% threshold
But 2Mb happens regardless within 6month.
So segwit wont happen at all, we'd have to trust these assholes, they wont activate shit except their 2mb capture the network block size hack.
It's a no go for me. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:35:57
Because the 2mb doesnt solve anything, but it does make running a full node impossible unless youre willing to spend thousands just to do so. Opens new attacks, slows network propagation, hasnt been tested, ect..
Whats so disastrous about a PoW change?  Im sure you can think up some disaster but Asic centralization needs to be dealt with.

A new algo could change to one of 100 algos randomly every few blocks or something. So we'd know what the possible algos are but making an asic for each one isnt feasable.

@_date: 2017-05-31 22:17:32


Segwit will be activated by UASF-148 without any obligations to hardfork.

Segwit has been running on testnet for over a year,  zero disasters.
Pow change doesnt need to entirely invalidate the current algo, every 3 block could use a different algo, something like that.

Its more a question of hacks and malware, which are absolutely everywhere.

Vorhees is trolling us.
His "serious questions" are actually assertions, he's fudding.
Look, heres the conclusions he's trying to illicit:
    1) Theres little mining power behind UASF-148
    2) UASF-148 creates a hardfork/ chain split
    3) UASFers are hypocrites
    (his edit) And all the above would be UASF-148's fault
This is just one of the NY agreement signatories doing what they do. Like Eric Vorhees really needs to post shit on reddit to get these answers.

Jihan is going to thwart UASF-148 for as long as possible.
But UASF-148 is happening and the economy will choose 2mb segwit coins over the heavily centralized, ASIC boost monopolized, Antbleeding, small block Jihan-Ver legacy chain.
Jihan will never get the hardfork he wants. never. But he's welcome to hard fork it himself at any point in time.

youll know if its a private key if you can sign a transaction with it.
The wallet seed will rebuild your wallet, but not all wallet seeds are compatible. Plus you have to rely on hardware and software to rebuild from seed.
Seeds are convenient and relatively safe. But i dont fucks with them personally
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:23:19
The whole point. 
All the exahashes in the world wont make a network secure, not with centralized mining and covert Asicboost.
Only a troll would argue otherwise.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:29:29
The deal is that smaller blocks are an optimization. Small blocks are faster and allow anyone to run a full node.
Bigger blocks make it so you'll need a $10,000 computer and a crazy internet connection just to run a full node. Besides not solving the scaling issue.
@_date: 2017-07-04 18:46:02
UASF 148 rejects non segwit blocks after Aug 1st. Regardless.
I looked through your comments. Let me help you out, your misunderstanding is obvious; 
Segwit normally activates based on miner threshold like 95% for bip 91, 80% for segwit2x. But UASF-148 doesnt go that route and instead starts enforcing on a flag day, Aug 1st, mining threshold be dammed.
You should stop responding, save some face, and read up on the UASF-148.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:07:57

No way, Segwit coins are the only ones that wont dissapear on you after Aug 1st.
And its not even an if, its just a when.

@_date: 2017-07-02 20:56:24
I think this is how regular people with UASF nodes can become potent economic nodes: by sending yourself your bitcoins on the Segwit chain with a high mining fee.
We could move a large amount of coins that way, and create an incentive for miners greater than the legacy chain can provide
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:18:16

We're willing to pay more than one legacy bitcoin for one Segwit Bitcoin. So legacy miners will get more Legacy bitcoin mining Segwit Bitcoins actually.

You just made up that definition. Commercial transactions matter more than some other types of transaction??? of course not.
That $50 could be spent on mining fees for UASF miners, and would make a healthy impact. Commercial actors pay as little fee as possible to get confirmed.
But UASF nodes can, and will, pay miners waaay extra in fees just to support the cause. And there will be zero slippage, 100% every satoshi will necessarily go to UASF miners.
So dont buy the "youre not economic so you dont matter" FUD. You have Bitcoins, you're economic, you matter.

Yeah this works, sorta. Pools need to collude to make it effective. And people will see it; blocks full of unbroadcast tx's wouldn't go unnoticed.

@_date: 2017-06-30 17:22:22
Segwit2x hardfor cannot succeed because theres no time to test it, exchanges will list both coins, and users will want access to their original Bitcoins. Ultimately miners will earn more mining the original bitcoin and so Segwit2x coin will become worth very little and fail.

The idea is that mining pools, even small and less powerful ones, can win blocks on the 148 chain. Might take a while, but if theyre the only ones mining it they'll find blocks eventually.

Well, in basic terms, the reorg throws away all the post Aug 1st legacy blocks and the transactions in them. And the coins created from mining those blocks vanish.
The transactions within the abandoned legacy blocks are still valid tx's but need to be resubmitted, 'replayed' on the segwit chain where they can be validated and put into segwit blocks.
However any transaction that contains legacy coins mined after Aug 1st will be invalid on the segwit chain. Transactions that only contain pre-Aug 1st coins can be replayed on segwit chain and 'rescued' from oblivion.
Theres more technical nuance to it than that though.
TLdr; Segwit coins are safe, Legacy coins have risks and complications.

This price crash is just confirmation of that, miners have conceded. But now, without asicboost bitcoin mining is worth less to them, and so we're seing them adjust their holdings.

They're not the same thing. Test it out with some of your wallets that use recovery seeds, try getting the actual private keys.
You may find its not as simple as you thought. Not all wallets are the same. Contact the makers and ask specifically if they're supporting UASF-148
@_date: 2018-12-20 08:19:30


Woah. Dude, people fuck up seed phrases all the time, usually by skipping a word accidentally or getting the word order wrong. And when they do, they loose ALL their bitcoin all at once. Fuck up a paper wallet and only one address is lost.


Ok, we at $65,000,000,000 market cap, to say $1,000,000 has been lost from paper wallets isnt much of a criticism. Compare paper wallets to using online exchanges, online wallets, hardware wallets, brain wallets ect. and paper wallets are amoungst the safest.


Yes, and they're comprehensible problems lay people can deal with. "work offline...sweep the whole wallet...don't use a wireless printer ect." Plus, most hot wallets have a "sweep paper wallet" function which makes it easy.


You're tripping. such fud. Your issue is with javascript and code review. Nothing is safer than manually writing down a private key yourself on a piece of paper.
And there's the issue of forks. Paper wallets will collect all your crypto dividends, offline, and keep them safe... you can hodl forks with ease. Try getting fork coins off a seed phrase wallet *safely*; You'll need help or even developer support.
u/belcher, your opinion is fine, but as a moderator "speaking officially" its given too much weight here. Especially since you're not actually providing complete and better solutions.
The buck stops with paper wallets. It's the private key, in your hands, directly. And yes, you do need to learn how to handle yo shit.

If you have at least 2 of the three private keys then you can access the multisig address.
Wallets will vary but basically once you import 2 of the private keys the multisig account will appear like magic in your wallet.

im curious why you think theres not 3.6 million btc to be mined.
Or maybe you're from r/btc, in which case i'd understand.

Miners create forks, Nodes create rules.
If miners want to ignore the rules they'll create a fork. You cant blame others, this is a matter of fact

Replay is how you can recover from a reorg, but its a race, requires some skills, something like being double spent on.
Sounds like youre referring to coin tainting and separating them onto different addresses. But that wont save legacy coins from vanishing in a reorg. 
Segwit coins will be the only safe ones after Aug 1st
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:29:38
On reorg legacy coins will absolutely vanish from wallets. From the whole blockchain.
Now you see em, now you dont.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:36:04


Very profound observation that this is like the guttenberg press but in reverse. Without our ability to run full nodes we cant publish to the blockchain.
This is the crux of it.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:08:25
Doesnt need full blocks at all. Lightning transactions are nearly instant and cost waay less.
 I'd use lightning whether blocks were full or empty.

2 blocks. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:51:12
You didnt specify when A and B were mined, and youre probably confusing a replay attack with a reorganization.
Coins mined after Aug1st on the legacy chain will be vulnerable to vanishing due to reorganization, nothing you can do about it. No fix.

If they cant hire enough people to take my money, im just going to assume they dont have enough people to give my money back when i want it either. 
I'd so much rather they just made their site invite-only and then took care of their customers. I can handle a no, this months long "we'll get back to you soon about your important financial issue" is making me hate them :)

Good shit Tone.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:49:32
This is exactly it.
With Segwit we're probably not going to need a base blocksize increase for years if ever. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:33:12
Good analogy.
You forgot the +2bedrooms, you dont want the +2bedrooms but your neighbors got together and made a charter that says you have to have +2bedrooms. They cant design or build for shit, but they're taking care of it for you.

He would have just been more prepared and done a proper double spend no?
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:09:30
Decent article, But the analogy is off.
It would be more accurate to say the miners are more like the military branch; they're job is to keep us secure.
They got all the guns, but they need to stay under our control at all times; or they're fired, decommissioned, discharged. ATM we have the miners holding shit hostage, Jihan is posting pics of dead people (threatening us), making demands. They're way out of control.
Miners will take our orders and stfu. They've got no seat at the table. Their job is to be out on that wall, guns pointed OUTWARD.
Good article Jimmy.

Something about bit1 is very sensitive to Bitmain. Maybe it breaks some part of their AsicBoost or something but they've always been very touchy about bit1.
They're hiding something.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:31:15
It's very misleading and frankly dishonest your numbers.
Your percentages are based on a 33 person online survey. cmon.
You site arbitrarily "weighted" percentages at that. Your data is worse than useless. It's biased.

Nope. I'm for voluntary participation.
No bloatware bundles or frustration compromises. And Jihan should fork every single one of the changes he wants, whenever he wants to. Why's he so pussy?

well, this economic activity you speak of; Theres no way those large exchanges and will turn their back and lock out 80% of their customers. That wil-not-happen. They would still owe their customers original bitcoins anyway, waaaaaay too much liability.
Like you say, and i agree, most users dont care enough to switch to segwit2x. Users will stay put on the core chain.

Theres physical ASICBOOST hardware on Bitmain/ Jihan chips.
Jihan says he never uses it to gain an advantage or anything, and thats its just like there for the lolz basically. He even shows us some open source code that doesnt use utilize hardware.
But not everyone is Garzik level ho-tard and knows Jihan runs proprietary code thats uses the ASICBOOST.
We sure dont need to conflate the two your right. Segwit takes care of it. Aug 1st.

Yes, PoW change is for later.
Good luck leading the lemmings to the promise land.

Just let these companies know that you expect your original bitcoins to be available to you. And if they take your original bitcoins and swap them out with 2x coins, you'll consider that fraud/ theft.

You're math is wrong, bad assumptions.
I'll bounty the first 148 block right now: ill pay 13 Legacy bitcoins for it.  Real bounty.
Of course theres someone who'd buy the 2nd block, and so on. Loaded and bear-whale posted publicly to be in the market, thats dozens of blocks just them.
Jihan is a bad actor that the economy wants to eject. Other miners cannot compete with ASICBOOST so just the level playing field alone is enough to make mining 148 more profitable for them.
Legacy chain has nothing compelling going for it. Nobody is rooting for jihan, he's dr.evil, and the movie is just about over.

Having the actual private keys is NOT the same as having the seed/ wallet recovery phrase.
Contact your wallet maker and ask about bip148 support.

hey stop saying "soon" ok? just pisses everyone off.
Try something like, "average wait time is currently 9 weeks" so that at least users know how long they'll be jerked-off.
Otherwise we expect attention within a few days, and obviously thats not going to happen.

148ers just handed Bitmain their ass, they dont have the balls or the users to fork.
Let alone the technical ability, garzik aint cuttin it.
I hope they do fork off though, I'd prefer them off the network and running their own code. would be full of lolz to see that.
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:48:46
And now Blockstream owes you what exactly?
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:48:32

Straight up. The only hard fork Bitcoin O.G.'s are contemplating right now is a PoW Change.
Jihan can fork is mother if he wants fork.

34% of people want new ponies.
