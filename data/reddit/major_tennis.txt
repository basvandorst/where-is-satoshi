yeah you can get an app that would create a barcode for the payment amount to your wallet. Or just a barcode for your wallet address. the customer could scan it. Think all could run on phones wouldn't need a special device per se, perhaps a tablet for the payee. Instant transfer to fiat and payment processing I haven't heard of something that does this but i'm sure there is although I don't like it. What's the point in accepting bitcoin if you'll just sell it straight away. People want to buy with it to get it circulating. I mean the fluctuations can cut both ways. Accepting BTC is going to add work to accountancy regardless. worth the aggro

an owner not converting straight to fiat isn't now running a hedge fund. Perhaps the pizza owner should try to offer btc payments to the box manufacturer or flour supplier. I dnno man. but if you want fiat straight in your bank you might aswell use visa in my opinion. bitcoin as a middleman sounds redundant. How about offering fiat customers their change in bitcoin.

He did an interview in the UK with someone called Cathy Newman who he carried himself well and made good points. He doesn't even classify himself as conservative.

@_date: 2019-02-14 16:13:34
butters? that has one meaning that i know and its not applicable here. The whole case is fishy as. Even if there was any truth to the 'hits' which i doubt there is he's still not someone who has harmed another person. He's non violent. He's not a risk to society. You deem the evidence to be clear but you're to close minded to acknowledge that evidence could falsified. Case involves entrapment and corruption all over. If he wasn't charged and convicted of ordering hits then i treat it as such.
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:09:20

graphics card prices are high but there was no 300% price increase. I have a gtx 970 from 4 years ago and its worth like £10 more than i paid. Newer more expensive graphic cards have come out, but they didn't triple in price theyre just better and cost more. 
Graphical processing units are better at the math involved with mining than cpu's

I think its worth it if you're in a like casino and just won 10k and can't be bothered to learn but always kinda wanted some and you might blow that money later if youre drunk. but if you have access to a computer and time to spare you should learn about online exchanges or localbitcoins and decide a way to purchase that suits you best. I wanted to pay as little fees as possible so i converted my funds currency then sent them to the exchange no fee to transfer funds to the exchange and i got a good rate on currency conversion before i sent. using the exchange had no fee's because i was using buy and sell orders that would get filled by someone else not the exchange themselves.

doing rough maths assuming , mBTC is 1000th of a btc, current price 8134, 1mBTC = 8.134, 0.1mBTC =0.8134, 0.111mBTC = 0.902874. its about a 10% mark up which i'd assume was decent for a bitcoin ATM i've never understood why people so flagrantly post bitcoin ATM in this city that city etc. It's like that would be great if they weren't extortionate rates and fees.

I've actually not yet done it for withdrawal only for depositing. but you basically give your banks SEPA information and it takes longer than a usual transfer. ideally you want the money in euros. I'd recommend creating a revolut account and SEPA transferring it to that converting to GBP and then withdrawing to your bank via revolut .
