I played around with ethereum development in December 2015. Dozens of $5-10 escrow contracts that I could use to educate colleagues. I’m still finding them , except now they are worth a few hundred each.
It’s like finding cash in last years winters jacket, every time.

thats the thing about cryptocurrencies, they can't be banned.

this whole panel is a far cry from the one earlier today.
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:26:13

you already cant withdraw USD. if it closed without people being able to withdraw BTC , it would crash the price
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:46:47
Hi. Thanks for the question. I do not, but can ask the staff to add one!
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:32:14
It certainly was more exciting. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:08:37
i had an issue because i was using coupon codes with bitcoin that caused an order to fail. Customer Service was great the entire time. They fixed the bug the next day and had my refund back to me way faster than a credit card refund.
I've since made 2 more purchases on overstock, and their integration with coinbase makes it so much easier than a credit card.
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:42:04
how do they seize 28 million dollars of bitcoin without the private keys?
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:54:27
That's what the CS rep told me.  And it makes sense, implementing new payment system ... Coupon codes would be one of the last things to check 
@_date: 2014-01-28 12:23:21
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:35:40
same here, turns out it was an issue with the coupon codes. I had pretty personalized support from both Coinbase and Overstock and got the money back today. Placed another order immediately after. I mentioned that I didnt get the first time customer discount and they credited me 10$ after the fact.
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:46:37
it probably is because you send so many empty account reminders.
I know you are trying to get people using the system. But after the first or second, people ignore those and don't open them, or end up marking them as spam.
Both hurt your overall deliveribility.

@_date: 2014-01-16 03:06:28
And they just mentioned shoe on head.
, and reddit. WTF is going on
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:28:47
I made my first order this week on tigerdirect because of the bitcoin adoption, but I must ask - are you guys aware of the bitcoin communities opinion of Butterfly Labs who you continue to promote? They scammed early adopters out of thousands and thousands of dollars.

I noticed the email and read a couple typos... I thought maybe Coinbase was getting sloppy... I should have known.
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:47:14
hey man even if was your fault not having 2 factor authentication, just wanted to say sorry this happened to you.
People on the internet can be very cruel, but not everyone.
Good luck in the future. Thanks for the lesson.

a long enough timeline, this will infact return his investment. Could be a year but I am pretty sure he will break even, then any thing after that is a return.
@_date: 2013-10-10 20:04:42
I called them up and closed my account , letting them know it was due to their dropping of virtual currency exchanges.

interesting point about mining bitcoins, to realize then rebuy right away to not pay self employment tax down the road.
@_date: 2013-08-30 13:18:59
I bought that same USB Hub. Unfortunately you've already maxed it out for miners. The powersupply only provides 2.5A , and the hub only uses 2.0. Theoretically, 2.0 Amps is enough to run 4 miners, but in actuality it causes hardware errors on the 4th.
its too bad, as otherwise these things would be ideal.
