Yea we should all use RoR instead!!! Wait... [nope]( fixes nothing. Here's some dumb things in other languages. Nothing stops people who don't know what they are doing.
    
    a = b 
    a = a
    stringObj.equals(null)
    stringObj.equals("blah")
    if (var == True) :
    a=[[1,2,3,4,5]]*4
    [] + []
    [] + {}
    {} + []
    {} + {}

Wat? Scripts can have 2 step auth and scripts are executable..... (try chmod +x script.py &amp;&amp; ./script.py).
I think your trying to talk about the different between binary programs but if you have write access to the file on the server it's all moot. Just over write it with a new script of your choosing.

Capital gains when you sell same as other currency.


Why would this matter?


Same as a stock


What you exchanged it at and what you sold it at.


Same as if it was in USD. 


It's income. Just pay tax as if you were working for it (you are). You can probably write off your mining rig.

First thing copy your wallet.dat somewhere safe.
Then delete (or rename the folder) and reinstall the client. When it starts up it will create a new wallet file. Copy your wallet.dat over that file.
