Everything he is, will age poorly.

Dude you're so wrong.  Its 2 days 6 hours and 21 minutes.  Ridiculous. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:18:23
So what's up with this?

"I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior,"   -Donald Trump

So I'm suppose to bet that the President is lying...that is horrible financial advice.  LOL.

And while I hodl, run up a trillion dollars on a credit card...just like that subhuman parasite. Guess my grandkids will pay off my debt.

But Ryan literally ran on (and might continue running on) "fiscal responsibility".  We hired him to be the budget guy and he was very arguably worse than his predecessors. 
That's like you hiring me to be the janitor....and then I just shit on your rug.  Your 19 trillion dollar rug.

Well, it's a piece of really expensive metal now. 
@_date: 2019-09-17 03:29:58
He said this. Not me. He is anti-bitcoin. Not me. 
I think I'm missing something because there are a lot of anti-bitcoin people in this Bitcoin sub.
@_date: 2019-09-18 03:20:24
He literally says he’s not a fan of Bitcoin and has said it is used mostly to launder money.  
Do you just think he is lying?  Or being dramatic?  I don’t know how you can support the guy who doesn’t think BTC will be a thing.  Do you not like BTC?

You are buying an asset that he wants to ban, in order to eventually have him out of office, so the banned asset that he ruined can then maybe be worth something?
That is like shooting yourself because chicks dig scars. Dude. Bad argument.
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:42:44
LOL.  He’s the most powerful man on Earth.  Actually, ever.  His opinion on everything matters and can absolutely directly effect your and my HODLings.  
He might not be able to control it or shut it down but he can absolutely ruin the liquidity of the network and make it worthless.  He could brand it as a “terrorist funding network” and BRANDING is his thing, he could do it overnight with a tweet dude, wtf.  That is just one option and doesn’t even start to talk about the IRS.
He can destroy everything and he looks like he wants to.

I didn't hear an argument in there. You just called me retarded for protecting my investment. So thanks for that.
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:03:41
If you believe this then you don't understand the IRS or prison.  :)
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:18:42
Since when has him not having the power to do something stopped him from doing it?
If he tweeted "Bitcoin is banned in America" we'd all just have to deal with it. All institutional money would have to leave and we would be left hodling our d$
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:24:51
Not true at all. Good God. You know Andrew Yang supports BTC and is an evil Democrat.
@_date: 2019-09-17 03:23:21
Yeah but he could ruin the network, which is the reason it has value. It will exist, but will be worth maybe a buck or two as a novelty in other countries.
@_date: 2019-09-17 03:49:29
Should we just vote for pro-Bitcoin people? That was certainly help our wallets.  
Andrew Yang strongly supports BTC. He's a Democrat.
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:07:09
Voting for him would devalue the 20%, but the 80% of my portfolio will go up to make up for the loss. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:36:59
Seriously?  Vote against BTC because it can handle it and we should test it and make it harder on ourselves. Facepalm.
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:27:40
BTC and my money is my thing.  So obviously he's not the candidate for me. Fair enough.
@_date: 2019-09-17 03:06:58
I don't see how you can HODL and vote for him.  
I guess you could just throw your money in the trash though...it's a free country.
