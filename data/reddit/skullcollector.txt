Why the hell would I do that when it's going to be worth $10k by June 1st?  Give them to somebody else LOLPPPFFFFSHHHHYEAHRIGHT.  Remember that guy who bought a pizza with what would've ended up being like... MILLIONS of dollars worth of bitcoin?  LOL sucks to be that guy.  I'm not making that mistake - I'm letting it ride baby, come on bitcoin!  Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.  I'd spend bitcoins like I'd spend casino chips -- AT THE CRAPS TABLE.  I didn't buy these bitches for gas &amp; groceries, I bought this shit to GET RICH BITCH!!  LET'S GAMBLE!

I already knew that.  I had a car when I was 15 lol.  
I had a bank account for several years before that, complete with a debit card, paper checks, the whole nine.  Shocker, I know.  It was easier to get the card than it was to get the car.

How do you know what my goal is?  
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:11:16
First of all, gold has been dropping for about 9 of the last 160 months -- and has bottomed IMO -- "gold has been dropping for a while now" simply isn't true.  It's been one of the best performing asset classes of the last decade or so.     
Second, our personal choices don't really affect what's a good store of value and what isn't.  Yes we can choose to store our value in whatever we want -- you could choose to store your wealth in bananas if you want, but it doesn't matter how many people do it or why -- bananas just aren't a good store of value relative to other things like gold or the USD.  You can choose to store your wealth in BTC, but that'd be pretty dumb in my book.

I bet that guy is wishing he never used bitcoins for what they were intended for -- spending.  The incentive is to buy &amp; hold, not spend.  The people who are spending to "support the technology" are doing so against their better judgement.  That or they don't have very good judgement.  
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:51:27
Yes it does.  What's truly amazing here is the fact that you still think I give a fuck what you think or say, you're one of those hook-line-sinker suckerfish...  I thought I ignored you a long time ago.  LOL oh well better late than never...  cya! 
@_date: 2014-01-23 08:33:09
He has addressed that though.  To the people who say that the Payment network Is the backing, what gives bitcoin "intrinsic/inhrent" value, Peter says: "No it isn't."
@_date: 2014-12-07 09:35:14
No, losing bitcoin is not a flaw of bitcoin.  But the fact that when it is lost, it's lost forever and is never coming back - that IS a flaw of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-07-25 20:33:17
There's no attitude here.  I just tend to scoff at ridiculous assertions.  You're pulling all these probablys and maybes out of your ass.  You think I'd HAVE to agree?  Really?  Why is that?  I DON'T agree, so there goes that confident assumption.  Your $2500 ceiling for gold and your $10,000 floor for bitcoin are both totally arbitrary -- let's see you substantiate either one of those numbers in a way that isn't complete bullshit.  It's obvious that you have very high hopes for bitcoin, but it's also obvious that you're pulling your probablys and your maybes out of your ass.  
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:20:34

False.   Intrinsic value is what something can be used for if nobody else wants it.  If I have an apple, but nobody else on earth wants apples, I can still eat my apple.  If I have gold, but nobody else on earth wants  gold, I can still make some jewelry with it or fill a cavity or something.  If I have a pile of dirt that nobody else on earth wants, I can fill a hole or plant a garden or something.  
If I have a bitcoin and nobody else on earth wants bitcoin, I can't do SHIT with it.  :)
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:50:07
Well you're going off into another discussion -- I don't have a problem with the technology or competition.  I'm saying that's it's not like gold -- there is no real inherent value because the scarcity thing is a farce.  It's not scarce when you can make an unlimited number of exact copies of it.  Bitcoin is nothing like gold. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:55:48
Hrmmm... let's see.  Would I prefer to store my wealth in the dollar, moving at 2-3% in a year, or bitcoin, which could (and has) lost 50% in a single day?  That's a pretty easy decision for me. 
The USD is a MUCH more reliable and trustworthy store of value than BTC.

You should probably tune in -- you might've avoided watching your holdings decrease by HALF over the last few months.

@_date: 2014-03-14 19:07:06
I didn't change the question, I re-framed it to demonstrate how the network effect isn't 'intrinsic' to bitcoin, any cryptocurrency would have a network behind it.  A thing can't be scarce if you can make an infinite number of copies of it.  You obviously don't want to hear any opinions that  contradict your own, which is why you've dismissed me... And that's fine by me.  See ya.
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:37:13

@_date: 2014-12-26 19:45:24
Haha!!  Perfect!  Thanks for that amazing analogy. 
Warren Buffet made 60 billion dollars without tech, just like MJ became the king of pop without baseball.  Stop trying to focus on the fact that Michael can't swing a bat. I'll tell you about Warren Buffet's non-existent track record in tech when you tell me about MJ's non-existent track record in baseball.   At the end of the day NOBODY CARES because they're both irrelevant.
If you want to focus on Buffet's track record or lack thereof in technology, that's fine -- but it doesn't really have anything to do with the topic at hand, which is investing money.  
Well, I will give you credit for the successful red herring -- here we are discussing something that has nothing to do with anying.  Nice diversion.  Let's get back to the topic at hand shall we?  
Warren Buffet said long ago to stay away from bitcoin as an investment, and so far that has been rock solid advice.  We can talk about whether or not he understands it if you like, but again - it doesn't really matter does it?  He's right anyway.  Bitcoin has been a shit investment, just like he said it would.  So far his track record speaks for itself -- he called bitcoin a loser and that's exactly what it is. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:14:29


I'm glad we agree on that.  :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 03:21:07
I'm not convincing anybody to do anything.  I'll give my opinion for what it is, you can take it for what it's worth.  It's funny that you bring up speculating on the price as the primary measure of it's success or failure in a year.  Speculation is about the only thing bitcoin IS good for in my opinion.  
As far as the "white knight" stuff goes -- lol.  I'm just telling it like I see it.  I have *tons* of factual basis to work from, however, and I'm sorry but relative to *this* community, I beg to differ - I have a LOT more insight than the next guy.  I definitely will go ahead and spout my opinion, I'm sorry that you don't like that.

Yeah you can transfer bitcoins from one wallet to another no problem -- that's not what we're talking about.  I don't agree that it doesn't take any more thinking than cashing out of the stock Market.  Timing your sells to ensure volume can absorb your downward pressure??  Fuck that. And I've seen WAY too many horror stories to just go along with your "cashing out of exchanges is quite easy" claim.    Sorry but based on the evidence I've seen here, NO it isn't.

"Actions speak louder than words"
He's giving people the opportunity to exit their positions in bitcoin to enter what he calls "real money" (GOLD).  
The contradiction you guys have been clamoring for isn't there.  He's not contradicting himself, he's backing up his words with actions.  He does NOT want your bitcoins, and he's not here to support the bitcoin ecosystem.  He thinks people should GTFO out of bitcoin, AND he's giving them a way.

Granted, my company's migration wasn't a complete clusterfuck like MtGox...   but it doesn't matter how much you hate my opinion, my opinion IS valid.  Now fuck off, every last one of you.

No thanks, I don't want bitcoins.  My money is already on the table, my bets have already been placed.  Peter is willing to win a worthless bitcoin to prove a point -- I don't want a worthless bitcoin, and I don't care to prove any points.

I don't understand why you people need to use so much bullshit.  I mean, who said anything about gold being magical?  I know gold isn't fucking magical.  Nobody said that stupid shit.  But it does have a lot of properties that both individually and (more importantly) collectively give it value.  You're saying, "I don't know about any other uses" and that's supposed to be proof?   I have a feeling you're the kind of person who wouldn't look at a picture of proof if I showed it to you.  I'd put it in front of your face and you'd look away, and then say, "I didn't see it".   It's not my job to make you see reality.  Look at it or don't, it matters not to me either way.  
Yeah, gold is the most coveted metal on earth because it's so meh.  And shiny.

I think he's dead right about bitcoin.  He's not wrong about the Fed, which means he's not wrong about gold.  his timelines may be off, but not by much.  So, I disagree with you - I don't think he needs to admit anything.  He's much smarter than the above-average bitcoiner, so when this community berates him because he doesn't agree with you it really just makes bitcoiners in general look like a bunch of butthurt babies.

You don't have to be financially invested to not trust it.  It's like you guys are all boarding the Titanic, totally expecting the vacation of your lives... but some of us believe it's going to sink.  We don't gain anything by you sinking to the bottom of the ocean -- and it doesn't/hasn't felt good to watch it happen.  I visit this place to try &amp; keep people from boarding this doomed ship.  The people who laugh at me and say I'm stupid for thinking that, while they board the ship anyway...  well, I'll be honest it will definitely feel good to say "I told you so" when you're asking somebody to throw you a rope.  
I think it's pretty hilarious how so many of you have these "paid shills" conspiracy theories LOL.   Some of us just don't believe in it.  I have a hard time thinking of wealth as anything but hard, tangible assets that truly add to your quality of life.  Things like farmable land, shelter, vehicles, firearms, food &amp; water, collectibles, precious metals, etc. etc. etc.  "virtual" wealth is not wealth at all.  
Does BTC make a good payment system?  Sure.  But I'll never look at a pile of digital cash and think to myself, "I'm rich!"  Even money in the bank doesn't feel like wealth until it's been converted into something REAL.   I believe the infrastructure of our society is extremely fragile, and contingencies are bound to happen in the very near future.  Such events are inevitable in my opinion.  In the event of a collapse or even a major crisis...  I have serious doubts that people would accept digital tokens in exchange for real life goods &amp; services.

Stop putting words in my mouth.  I never said gold has more intrinsic value than anything else.  I never said gold is superior either.  You're also mistaken if you think I'm advocating using gold as an everyday currency to buy tennis shoes with.  That's pretty stupid actually, nobody expects to use gold like that.    You actually doing a pretty horrendous job of comprehending everything I write here, so I think I'm done.  I wish you would have actually processed the info I gave you here instead of just deflecting and counter-arguing for the sake of arguing.  Gold is what it is, it has been for thousands of years, and just because you don't like it, you're not changing it.  It IS the most coveted metal on the planet, for good reason.  There are no governments dumping gold for bitcoin.  There are no institutional investors dumping gold for bitcoin.  There is NOBODY in their right mind dumping gold for bitcoin.  That says all we need to know.    I definitely won't be replacing any of my gold with virtual tokens.

ps.  "people recommended bitcoin at a dollar!!!" Is a very stupid addition to this argument.  People were recommending penny stocks that made 100,000% in a week too.  That doesn't really say anything about the efficacy of that penny stock as a store of value, it's viabily as a currency, or it's risk as an investment. "People recommended btc at a dollar!!" Lol...

No, he's not an expert in everything - but he IS an expert in valuation, and his track record shows it.  You can insist that he's wrong about bitcoin because he doesn't understand it, but considering the fact that it needs about 200% growth just to get back to where it was last year, I'm going to side with Warren for now.

He goes on to say, "Again, he didn't say we're considering bitcoin or thinking about it in general. They're actively considering HOW they're going to enable bitcoin with paypal as if they already made up their mind"
Are you seriously not able to see the discrepancy here?  Do you want me to paraphrase what the CEO actually said into it's *real* literal meaning for you?  okay, here goes: 
"We're actively considering how bitcoin's important role in the future will play out.  We're also considering how to best take advantage of it... or even enabling it with paypal."  
See... he's not talking about enabling bitcoin within paypal.  He's talking about enabling *bitcoin's bright future*, with paypal.  
He never said they're actively considering HOW to enable bitcoin like they've already made up their mind.  He said they're actively considering how things might play out, and how they can take advantage.  Here's the crux of it bro:  if they decide that they CAN'T take advantage of it by enabling bitcoin, then they won't.  Again, they're not considering HOW to enable bitcoin, they're considering whether or not they can take advantage by doing so, depending on how things play out.

That's like saying LOL Wake me up when you can spend your rental property in the grocery store!  That's really a pretty stupid thought, you're making me not want to continue this painful conversation hahaha   
HEY THROWAHOYMATIE!!  HEY WAKE UP MAN, CHECK THIS OUT:
[since you asked](
[this is too easy](
[and for good measure](
[more? okay](
ps.   I've got to know -- when's the last time YOU walked into a Wal-mart or grocery store that accepted your bitcoins as payment?  :O NEVER!!??  DOH  Well when's the last time you made it out of the country with some bitcoin keistered?   How did you cash out once you got to where you were going?  Oh you had to do that whole account verification thing before you could turn it back into usable money huh?  Bummer.

"last year" lol...   Well it's a good thing I don't invest on a 1-year basis, isn't it.  Gold and silver have been *excellent* "investments" over the last decade or so. (However, PMs aren't an investment, they're a hedge.)    Bitcoin has been a horrible investment THIS year.  You're high on crack if you think holding physical PMs is no different than investing in stocks &amp; bonds.

He constantly references what he apparently believes to be axioms of fundamental truth, and he always tries to establish premises which are A) false or B) completely unrelated.  I watched him get shredded by Peter Schiff, and since then I haven't been able to even look at this guy's face without thinking to myself, "Please shut the fuck up".

Gold doesn't accidentally get deleted, you can't forget the password to your gold, and if you do somehow manage to lose your gold (by doing something stupid like storing it on an internet-connected device), it doesn't disappear forever.  So it's got that going for it.    And... "lacks tangibility"?  I'm holding a piece of gold in my wallet right now -- it's as tangible as anything else in this reality, (and I didn't have to melt it)  I have some in a safety deposit box and in a safe at home a well... been there for years - both seem pretty secure to me.  
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:08:36

You're right, you definitely don't know about me.  I've got a safe full of guns, gold and ammo (and a few other precious elements as well).  My favorites are the good old AGE and I'm an AK guy (as opposed to an AR guy).  You know what's especially nice about having immediate access to your wealth?  Not needing a network to confirm my transactions when I decide I want to move it from where it's "stored".  It might as well be on the other side of the world if nobody can confirm that I'm actually holding in my hands what I think I'm holding in my hands.  The only confirmations I need with my Phyzz are my eyeballs and maybe a little water.

@_date: 2014-12-27 03:41:21
Seriously?  What could we check?  How about the PRICE?   That's a good place to start, don'tcha think?  Let's see -- when asked what to invest in in 2014, Warren buffet said "stay away from bitcoin".  Here we are, at the END of 2014, and lo and behold the price went from about $550-$600 to about $320.  If you know the definition of the word investing, that claim is pretty falsifiable, no?  
Now he's saying stay away from it in 2015 as well -- what could we possibly check to falsify that claim?  Hrrrrmmmmm?    WAIT!  I got it! PRICE!  :)   Let's check the fucking PRICE at the end of 2015 to see if his advice about investing in 2015 "sure was right" or moronic.  Ya think?   
@_date: 2014-08-22 12:42:34
Lol these people are high.  No fucking way wealthy people will store their wealth in a bunch of virtual internet tokens.  Wealthy people store their wealth in REAL assets.  Things like land &amp; real estate, precious metals &amp; jewelry, art &amp; collectibles, boats, cars...  And in interest-bearing accounts/funds....   The people here who think bitcoin has the same qualities as gold are kidding themselves.  Bitcoin lacks one major attribute that gold has: it's GOLD.  Sorry but "it will probably steal a significant share of the precious metals markets" is a load of shit.  No it won't.
@_date: 2014-01-02 23:19:57
lol well it's obvious that I'm getting under your skin now.  Calm down, Cujo.  Just because we don't agree doesn't mean you have to get all butthurt.  I *am* listening with both ears but all I ever hear from you bitcoin disciples is how it's the second coming.  You sure seem to think you know a lot about me -- first of all, I don't need you to tell me what the horror stories I've read are about -- I know what they're about.  You obviously don't.  Second, I don't need for you to tell me to take the time to figure out what I'm talking about -- I've funded an exchange account and moved in and out of bitcoin/USD a few times now.  I hate to break it to you but I learned that it's a pain in the ass..... *by doing*.  
@_date: 2014-05-01 22:48:46
And that's perfectly fine. People who store value in gold aren't really concerned about it's inability to be transferred across the globe.  As you said, that's not what it's for -- bitcoin claims to be a payment system -- gold does not.  Bitcoin also claims to be a store of value, but as we've seen in the last several months, eh... it's not so great at that.  
Nobody is looking for gold to be spendable as a day-to-day currency.  You can build that as a strawman argument, but it's just a strawman argument.  The only functionality that people are *actually* looking for in gold is to store value, and it does a stellar job of that - much better than bitcoin has done.    
Go ahead and head over to or and ask them how concerned they are about the fact that they can't spend their precious metals online.  NONE of them are worried about that -- you know why?  Because that's not what they bought it for. 
Comparing gold to bitcoin so that you can point out gold's lack of functionality, while nobody is actually looking for that functionality from it -- is pretty fucking stupid, don't ya think?  You might as well compare bitcoin to agricultural property or watches or firearms... or houses.

That's like saying you want to pay the metal weight price for a car.  If you want to buy raw material, buy raw material.  If you want to buy a finished product, like a kruggerand or an eagle (or a subaru), that costs more.  That has nothing to do with storage/transport.  It's basically manufacturing costs - and the things the manufacturer does adds value by making it more recognizable and measurable.  I can have a $1200 bar or a $1260 coin shipped to me for $10 and I can store it for free.

If I made &amp; sold food, or beer, I'd eat or drink some of it before selling it to someone.

Yes I have read it.  If they're guilty of fraud it's because they said they shipped equipment that they really hadn't.  They told their customers up front that there was a long waiting list and therefore buying time-sensitive hardware from them was a gamble.  Customers who bought from them and then got all indignant when they had to wait a long time just like the company said they would -- it's their own fault. The charge of fraud *might* stick on the shipping thing, but it won't stick on the fact that they were testing their hardware how they saw fit.

Research??  I'll do you one better.  [The proof's in the pudding.](  The things that make it completely anonymous, untraceable and secure are the very same things that make it an unsafe place to store money.  You apparently think making something impossible to track is nothing but good.  You clearly don't realize that this "monumental technological breakthrough" is more of a vulnerability than a strength.  It's a HUGE risk to anybody storing wealth in BTC.
I see people every day who lose bitcoins into thin air.  Some guy lost $20k on an iPhone app just last week -- he thought he did all the right things but he's $20k poorer today anyway.  Yep, the protocol works alright.  It works so well that lots of people lose their wealth into the black hole that is "unbreakable encryption" on a daily basis.  And the resounding answer to all those poor people who thought they knew the protocol, and trusted it : "sucks to be you.  You're fucked".
Obviously there are a LOT of holes in the protocol.  Who needs hearsay -- there are thousands of real-world examples to learn from.  
I'll google it for you if you want. 
You can start here though if you want non-hearsay "research":

He didn't change his opinion.  I guarantee you he'll say that himself.  His opinion is that they're not a safe store of value - and sure enough, he's not storing any value in them.  He's accepting people's USD after they convert their bitcoins - that's not the same thing as actually accepting bitcoins and holding them with the idea that they're worth something.  If he'd really changed his mind he'd actually own some bitcoins.

If you had cash, metals, ammo, food, etc.  you could trade those things with no problem whatsoever -- you just need to find a counterparty to transact with.  That's why keeping some of those things on hand for such an event is a good idea.  You can hoard all the bitcoins you want -- I for one would NOT accept bitcoin for MY food, ammo, metals, etc.  I ~might~, if that's all you have, but you're getting a serious markup and if somebody else wants what you want, but he has cash, gold, silver, ammo, food, etc.... he will be getting the goods, not you.

MtGox proved that they were a big risk to every last person who owns bitcoin.  Call it whatever you want -- you can't deny that that kind of risk is real, and significant.  People here are trying to imply that by holding bitcoin they're impervious to the actions of others.  Nothing could be further from the truth -- they rely on LOTS of people to do the right thing, and lots of systems and services to be up and running  in order for their bitcoins to hold their value.

Arguing against the viability of bitcoin is not the same thing as arguing for central banks.  You bitcoiners take "I don't trust bitcoin" to mean "I love the current system and see no problems".  Nothing could be further from the truth.  No bitcoin critics were harmed in the burning of the

You're proving that you just want to be mad that somebody bet against your beloved Magic the Gathering cards.  If you had enough sense to see the principles behind the bet instead of just the miniscule numbers, you'd see that taking a risky bet with a small payout AND THEN WINNING IT proves that he's confident and way smarter than you bitcoiners are.  
But you don't so you don't. :(
I think it's funny how you only attach the "potentially $infinite" part to YOUR favorite virtual money but fail to see that same potential in gold.  You're right, it IS a potentially $infinite bet -- if it turns out that way for peter it won't matter that his 1btc winnings are worthless.

I don't like houses because: 
1. I can't back them up
2. I can't teleport them to the other side of the planet in the blink of an eye
3. I have to hide and guard it, instead of simply encrypting it.
4. Hardly any store accepts houses as payment
5. I cannot easily split it into small pieces to pay with
6. It takes up space
7. It could be confiscated
I can't understand why anybody would own a house, fools!!
edit: for the obtuse ones here, my point is: if you don't like gold you obviously don't know what it's for. 
 hint: gold doesn't need to do any of the things that this fool listed.  If he understood gold's purpose, he wouldn't be worried about the fact that you can't zap across the globe.  If that's what you're looking for from gold, you're stupid.

Pointing out that $600 and $1300 are not equal is not "being pedantic", it's called "basic math".  Or, if you like, "attention to detail".  "Reading comprehension" works well too.    
So it's actually an advantage to pay a $1300 ante vs. a $600 ante?  Hrmmm...  seems legit.  I bet you *would* take that bet, you non-pedantic, no-basic-math-havin, no attention-to-detail-payin non comprehendin-what-you-read ass FOOOL.

(That post didn't last 5 minutes, by the way)  There are so many stories of people who've been destroyed by this "experiment".

That's not what I say.  That's what all the people involved first hand say.  It's in the history books now, all you gotta do is go back &amp; read it.  You're too "derp" for that though I guess.  
If you can ever find a few minutes to go non-derp and actually learn something, give this a read (available in this very thread, you obviously missed it):

I feel sorry for the poor bastards who bought 4 or 5 months ago though -- HODL on for your lives people, hopefully you don't need your wealth while it' still worth HALF what you bought it for.  What if it takes 100 years to prove your (currently unproven) history right?  Fine, we'll be able to say that historically it *does* always recover lost value -- too bad it took 100 years.  Until then, stop making up your own history.  It's pretty fucking evident that bitcoin has NOT historically always recovered lost value.

What a laughable comparison.  YOUR guarantee vs. that of a national government -- lol OF COURSE waxwing the schmuck's guarantee is "empty".  It may come as a surprise to you, but a guarantee given by the government is a LOT less "empty" than some internet guy's guarantee.  The fact that I wouldn't be assured by YOUR guarantee has absolutely no bearing on whether or not I'd be assured by the government's guarantee. 
Funny, you say "it's an entirely empty guarantee" but... when's the last time your US dollars weren't accepted by ANYONE?    How can it be an entirely empty guarantee when that guarantee has NEVER been broken?

Lol I think it's funny how, if you're anti-bitcoin you're automatically assumed to be pro-fiat or worse, "oblivious".  Good old fashioned gold and silver do just fine to protect me from the dreaded woes of the Federal Reserve and the sinking FRN - a hell of a lot better than bitcoin could ever claim to provide.  Hell, ANY of the hard assets I listed before will do a better job of preserving wealth than bitcoin will, in my opinion.  I'm a lot less oblivious than you think, son.  
To answer your question: no.  Bitcoin has all the properties of the FRNs in my bank account, but
 none of the properties of the hard assets that make up what I consider to be my wealth.
I bet the people at the Federal Reserve are absolutely elated that so many of you bitcoiners feel rich because you have a bunch of virtual tokens.  You're holding literally nothing and calling it your wealth.  To be honest, I think if you think bitcoin saves you from The Fed's fiat, you're a sucker falling right into their trap.

edit:  LOL That's how the world works kids, you don't have to like it, but not liking it doesn't change it.  There no reason to let banks "play" with your money now -- the only reason people do is because banks promise a certain yield.  And just like in today's world, if a "bitcoin bank" offered me a good enough yield, I don't give two shits about what they do with it as long as they hold up their end of the deal.

Oh and by the way, did you really just say, "when the internet decentralized"??? LMFAO.   Newsflash: The internet isn't really decentralized at all LOL.

False.  I can transfer bitcoins for dogecoins, dogecoins for litecoins, and litecoins for bitcoins -- with no problem whatsover.  21 million bitcoins + hundreds of billions of dogecoins + 84 million litecoins + however many billions or trillions of whatever other cryptocoins might arise over time, ALL of them exchangeable for one another...   
The world is already saturated with cryptos that supposedly have some sort of monetary value.  If everything on the entire planet was worth a quadrillion dollars, and there were only 21 million units of exchange to go around to represent that wealth, then yeah those 21 million rare, unique coins would have a lot of value.  But the reality is there is no limit to the number of virtual coins that we can create to represent that value.  The more that exist in the world, the less valuable they actually are... and if that number is infinite, the ultimate value they have is zero.

Yeah, no thanks.  I don't need time to figure it out - it's pretty obvious for even the greenest of investors that this is a tumultuous, extremely volatile market and it is NOT suitable as a store of value.  You say it outperformed every other stock or commodity by far since 3/13 -- that's not proof that it's a store of value.

None of those possibilities have anything to do with bitcoin the currency, and therefore don't add any value to it.  Are they valuable features in their own right? Yes.  But if some of these features haven't even been thought of yet, let alone implemented into the currency, how could they possibly add value to the currency?
@_date: 2014-01-17 18:06:24
Well, that's basically where I'm at with it too.  Sure you can say technically they're "worth" the current price but in *reality*, I say hell no they're not worth anywhere close to that.  In the same way that tulips fell back down to their *actual* value, I expect bitcoins to fall back to their *actual* value, which, as you said, isn't even as much as a tulip.

Well, it's one guy's opinion about why gold is the ONLY thing that fits the bill for money... meanwhile we have a LOT of things that work as money, and silver is one of them.  It's great to have ideals about what should be, but what IS suggests that now is a good opportunity to make a good flip from gold to silver.  
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:59:30
Well, we're talking about two different currencies.  If we're in the context of USD, then no I don't buy less electronics because there is no incentive to hold dollars -- they'll be worth less tomorrow than they are today.  If we're in the context of bitcoin, the opposite is true -- I probably would buy less stuff because there is so much incentive to just hold onto it.  From the very second I obtain FRNs, I know that they're losing value and I'm in a hurry to get them into something that will either add, hold or increase in value.  The reverse would happen with a deflationary currency.  I'd be very hesitant if not downright averse to spending them on something that won't keep up with the appreciation of the currency.  The mathematical incentive is to hold, not spend.  A lot of bitcoiners do spend to support the ecosystem but that's illogical and counter-productive to the individual.  You guys are all so big on math -- well, in the long run the mathematics will win.

@_date: 2014-07-26 16:29:54
First back to your previous comment.  I'm not one sided.  I have given bitcoin as much consideration as I've given everything else in the world for storing my wealth.  Trust me, if I truly believed bitcoin was going to perform, I'd be in it.  I don't, so I'm not.  I've given it careful consideration.  Be open, be reasonable lol.   Fuck yourself bro, I'm no fool - I'm very open and very reasonable and I'm confident in my stance, I trust my own instincts and analysis.  You can say that's a terrible quality of mind to have, but my bottom line says otherwise.  
Now, back to the conversation. You're still stuck on the idea that, because the pot odds would basically be in bitcoin's favor, 2:1 basically, that its' a bad bet.  
Think of it this way:  if it was a hand of poker, whoever put the gold in the pot put $1300 in, and whoever put the bitcoin in put $600 in...  the total pot is worth $1800.  You're saying that bitcoin is the proper bet no matter what because the pot odds are 2:1.  
You're missing something though.  THE CARDS.  What if the gold player has a full house, and the bitcoin player only has 3 of a kind?  then those pot odds don't really matter do they?  yeah he's only winning half of what he put on the line, that was risky as hell... but guess what?  HE WON.  an ugly 1:2 payout, but hey, +$600 is +$600.  
You're absolutely right that if the cards are opposite and the bitcoin player has the full house, then yep, he wins twice as much as he put on the line.  He only wagered $600 but he took home $1200, 2:1 payout.  Not too shabby. 
You know what? If I'm sitting on 4 of a kind, I'll bet dollars to donuts.  I don't care WHAT the pot odds are, if I've got the nuts, I'm pushing my chips into the pot.  I don't see why this is so hard to understand.  
And here's the bottom line: If you think bitcoin is holding a better hand than gold is, you're in for a surprise.  
As far as picking a number and substantiating it... lol, no. That's a circle-jerker's game, i don't play it.  
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:00:46
I can't send my house to someone halfway around the world in 10 mins with 3 confirmations either.  Know why?  Because people don't buy houses to use as everyday currency, just like people don't buy gold to use as everyday currency.

I think like this, and I DO delay purchasing of electronics.  When I built my last computer, the top-end i7 processor was over a thousand dollars.  I bought the 3770k for $350 instead -- but 6 months earlier IT was the top processor and cost over a grand.  I waited.  Why?  Because what 1BTC said is the truth.  
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:43:18
No, I haven't tried ultrasound -- I've only ever done surface tests &amp; specific gravity myself.  I don't have kilo bars or anything, mostly just 1/4, 1/2 &amp; 1 ounce coins from the Perth &amp; US mints, and some krugerands.  I try to buy only recognizable, easily verifiable minted pieces, and I buy from reputable, trusted sources.  Not 100% foolproof but I've never had any issues. 
I do think you're right about cryptocurrencies -- they are the future.  There is obviously a part of me that is very hesitant to get on board because it feels like such a scam.  It's like bottling air and calling it compressed money or something.  I just don't think I could ever feel comfortable storing wealth in it because I'd be too afraid that it might just vanish.  I'm already nervous enough that my brokerage accounts &amp; savings accounts might up &amp; disappear one day...  that's why I got into precious metals in the first place.  Bitcoin doesn't feel any different to me than those "ones &amp; zeros on a computer somewhere" that could vanish overnight.  But at the same time, I see LOTS of money being made, and I do see a wave of adoption sweeping around the world, so...  
So I guess what I really think is, I believe that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are a great idea for a specific problem -- which is sending money from one person to another quickly and efficiently.  We definitely needed that.  And I'm on board with it for that purpose.  My issue comes when I think about storing wealth in such an apparatus.  It feels too transient; with my aforementioned expectations for what's coming in the near future, I just can't see holding a bunch of digital tokens as being very useful in a world where real-life resources are dangerously scarce.  I realize that's kind of a dystopian outlook but after the last decade or so in this country, unfortunately you have to think about the worst-case-scenarios if you want to stay sane.   
Thanks again for the friendly discussion, and for hearing me out on these things.  It gets terribly frustrating when I'm laughed out of the building over &amp; over &amp; over again when I KNOW I'm not a crackpot. It's been refreshing to be able to voice these concerns to somebody and actually have them acknowledge me as not stupid hehe...
Oh yeah, to answer your question earlier: yeah I have dabbled in bitcoin a little bit.  I bought $100 worth back when it was $100.  But I got Goxxed :\

The internet has been trending toward centralization and away from decentralization for a solid 25 years now.   You can try to convince me otherwise, but all I have to do is look around to see that you're just flat out wrong.
To summarize my Microsoft anectode as simply "putting things in a central location" is either a complete lack of understanding of what cloud service, platform as a service, and software as a service architectures are all about, or a deliberately obtuse stance.  I can assure you that it's a whole lot more than just putting things in a central location - in fact NONE of those things are actually in a central location - so maybe my first guess (a complete lack of understanding) is where you're at.    Obviously you've NOT heard of Salesforce, so I'll withdraw *that* question.   
You've gone out of your way to try to duck &amp; dodge every single one of my articles &amp; anecdotes, and honestly it just makes you look obtuse because all of your arguments are terribly flimsy, borderline desperate.

It's not about "really believing" the price of bitcoin will go up.  It's about recognizing it for what it is -- a volatile, risky place to put money.  That's why, even if you're bullish, it'd be stupid to put every last dollar into it.  If you just blindly believe it's "to the moon!" forever and ever, you're stupid and it's more than likely going to end very badly for you.  Isn't the mantra around here "only invest what you can afford to lose"?  So... how does that jibe with "put EVERY LAST DOLLAR into bitcoin"?

It depends on a lot more than just time.  Price stability is a big factor as well -- I think we can probably both agree that something that loses 60% of its value overnight makes for a pretty treacherous store of wealth.  I for one won't be storing MY wealth in bitcoin anytime soon.

@_date: 2014-03-12 15:29:20
None of these issues are any bigger than the issues facing bitcoin.  
1.  I have to become a damn expert in cryptology to secure my BITcoins from getting stolen - I can't keep this so-called "internet money" on any of my *internet-connected* devices and I have to learn about all the caveats and gotchas of wallet functionality and online security, with absolutely no recourse if I get it wrong.  Also, you're talking about grading and slabbing -- I don't do any of that.  I don't care about or invest in numismatics, I care about melt value and I invest in bullion. 
2. It's funny, this tungsten thing gets brought up all the time but I NEVER hear of anybody getting burned by it.  It's easy enough to verify -- X-rays, specific gravity, ultra-sonics...  Just like you're a fool if you do things in the bitcoin world wrong, you're a fool if you buy even a moderate amount of gold without doing your due diligence.  
3.  I don't own gold so that I can wear or carry it on a daily basis.  I don't use it as a currency, I use it as a store of wealth.  Compare the issues you listed, "my vault might be empty" or "my safety deposit box might get confiscated" with "my cold storage got lost/stolen/destroyed" or "what was on my thumb drive is suddenly not there anymore".  With bitcoin, you could actually be holding it in your hand *while it vanishes*.  Bitcoin doesn't really circumvent gold's issues, it has it's own set of similar issues and I think they're easier to exploit than gold's.  Some guy in Malaysia or Bulgaria or some shit could steal your bitcoins from the comfort of his own home without you ever noticing until it's too late -- I'd like to see somebody try that with my gold.    Do you know how often people in or make posts saying, "I woke up today and and all my gold &amp; silver is gone!!"?    Like...  never.   
4.  Again, I have no intention of using it for daily transactions.  That's not it's purpose in my portfolio.  I use good old cash or debit for daily transactions, and I don't ever have any problems with that.   Singapore!!??  Why the hell would I want to sell my gold in Singapore when I have thousands of willing buyers right here in my home city?  
Bitcoin solves a problem that nobody seems to have.  I don't need to send money to somebody on the other side of the planet.  Even if I did, there are already solutions to that problem that I have no issues with.

Translation: nobody is pushing for euro adoption in the US.  Why on earth would anybody expect to have an easy time living on Euros in America?  That *is* the expectation with bitcoin though.  You guys *are* pushing for bitcoin adoption in America.  Transact your daily lives in bitcoin, right here in America - that's what you guys are shooting for is it not?  Nobody is pushing for that for the euro.  Your comparison is bunk.   
The euro is a currency for Europeans.  Bitcoin is a currency for drug dealers &amp; super geeks.  Neither is a good currency for daily life in America.  If it's just a matter of adoption, you can't compare the two because nobody is trying to get the euro adopted in America like you guys are with bitcoin.

Ummmm..... we've already established that Peter is taking more risk than the other guy to make a point.  Are YOU so fucking stupid that you can't get over that fact?  Why are you so worried about the odds?  It doesn't really matter what the odds were if he WINS now, does it? And if he does win the bet, it proves the opposite of your assertion that he "doesn't know what bets to take" because.... ahem.... again, HE WON THE BET.

First of all, yeah -- your job is at risk.  Obviously you don't care too much about that so...  let's talk about legal and financial ramifications.  I'm pretty sure you'd be committing larceny, probably of the "grand" variety, so there's that.  If the bologna sandwhiches and showering with 7-foot hairy men isn't enough deterrent for you, you might also be liable for restitution i.e. paying back every penny that you stole in electricity etc (and then some).

Nah. 
You obviously have no idea what the conversation was about since the guy I replied to deleted his comment.  (wonder why?) You got all butthurt over a comment  that you read out of context lol.  Wipe your eyes crybaby.
Since you're sort of out of the loop here, let me fill you in:
See, the user who deleted his comment above, actually asserted that Peter Schiff doesn't actually sell physical gold - only "1% certificates to the Perth Mint" (LOL).  So the link labelled "False" is a link to a page where you can actually buy *physical* metals and take *actual, physical* delivery of them.  
Then, that user went on to say, "I don't know about you, but I prefer having access to my wealth -- not stored in some vault on the other side of the world".  
Then, after he read my reply (the one that has affected your emotions so deeply) he deleted that dogshit.  
I have a feeling that if you'd known who/what I was responding to, your stomach cramps wouldn't have hurt so bad.
TL;DR:  Take some motrin, pussy.

Like I said before - fine.  You've proven that bitcoin does indeed have some intrinsic value, but VERY little.  So I'll concede that bitcoin has VERY LITTLE if any inherent value, but not even a fraction of the inherent value of an apple or even a pile of dirt.
What can you do with an apple that nobody wants? LOTS of things - I could even use it as a token of value, like you can with bitcoin.  What can you do with a bitcoin that nobody wants? Say you have it, or give it away - that's about it - you're certainly not going to eat it or plant a tree with it.
@_date: 2014-03-15 17:36:38
Well, it goes to show why individual messages are essentially worthless. If we only had 21 million e-envelopes in the world, yep, they'd each be worth a lot.  But since there is an unlimited supply of of them, they don't have any value -- they're just vehicles for the message.  That's what cryptos are -- a vehicle for the value, not the *actual* value.  And, they are unlimited.  
I could never see myself looking at a thumb drive chock full of bitcoin and think to myself, "I'm rich!"   I'd only ever feel rich if I cashed those BTC out and bought real world stufff with it.

If you put 10 or 20% of your net worth into bitcoin, sure - I can call that a substitute for traditional savings.  If you put everything you own into it, like OP, you're gambling.  It's not the amount of risk that matters - it's how much of that risk you're taking on. (Not that risk isn't a factor -- it should be a BIG factor in where you put your savings, which is why I think people who put their entire life savings into bitcoin are stooooooopid)  If you put your NECK on the line by putting all your eggs into that one risky ass basket , you're not saving.  You're gambling.

LOL wow.  Really????  Okay.  
Google is MY friend, apparently it doesn't like you though...
Here are a few personal anectodes as well: 
I used to buy my internet service from a company called Dimensional Systems -- they were a small, local shop -- one of several dozen companies to choose from in my city.  Today there are about 5 companies to choose from and they're all huge corporations.  
Social Media.  We can ALL go to ONE website to see what ALL of our friends and family are up to.  We didn't have that 20 years ago.  
My company pays for a lot of products in the Microsoft Stack.  We used to have to pay for each software title individually, buy the hardware, configure &amp; install it, pay for licenses, bandwidth, all that stuff.  Nowadays, you have all of that stuff available to you at the click of a button -- in the cloud.  I don't have to build solutions on premises anymore -- I can use a cloud service and share storage, processing, bandwidth, whole platforms if I want -- basically anything I want.  Ever heard of SalesForce.com?  It's the antithesis of the word "decentralized" and it's one of the biggest, fastest growing internet entities on the planet.  They're paving the way, they're setting the trend, the entire internet world is headed in that direction and it has been for a while now. 
Look up dude.  The sky is blue.

I'm sorry if this doesn't meet your standards for an participant, but I will continue participating nonetheless.  I think it's funny how, if somebody disagrees with a bitoiner the canned response is always "why are you even here!!??" lol

@_date: 2014-02-14 20:49:52
What does it matter?  He DID sufficiently prove to quite a few people that he wasn't going to fuck them over -- and then he fucked them over.  Were you hoping that he'd send you a nice letter or something that says, "BEWARE OF ME"?   Keep dreaming.  If investors did any amount of diligence, then him being mindless and failing to fulfill straightforward expectations should have been the queue to get the hell out.  
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:01:06
I'd buy it as a speculative investment -- I have no use for it as a currency.  It will never be anything more than a risky gamble in my book -- similar to a lottery ticket.

I thought you guys were just going to not comply.  What does it matter if you're just going to ignore the rules/guidelines anyway?  Who needs an official extension when the community consensus seems to be, "just ignore the rules, they have no power over us"?  You guys are so confident that bitcoin can't be controlled; I've seen it at the top of just about every Lawsky thread: someone arrogantly declares, "WE WILL NOT COMPLY!"  Well, back it up.  Let's see it.  
Why do you need an official extension?  Who cares?  Just don't comply and New York will crumble by the wayside, with all the rest of the "dinosaurs" who can't accept the "new paradigm".  Ignore these rules and bitcoin replaces New York.  Right?

I read that second to last question at least 10 times and I just don't understand what the fuck you are saying. 
You and Andreas want to focus on Buffet's track record of understanding technology -- well like you said, he doesn't really have one -- but that doesn't matter, does it?  When it comes to investing money, 60 billion dollars speaks for itself.  Talking about his track record in technology is like talking about Michael Jackson's track record in baseball. (Thanks again for that!)  Michael Jackson's still the king of pop despite not knowing baseball, and Warren Buffet's still the king of investing despite not knowing technology.

@_date: 2014-03-15 05:28:02
No, I don't think anything like that.  Of course I know that the market price doesn't matter -- I never said anything about it's ability to function as a transaction medium -- it does that fine and I have no problem with it for that purpose.  My issue comes when people talk about it as a store of value, or an investment vehicle.  There is no reason to believe that it will store value long term based on the idea that the network effect is what gives it value.  "The network effect" isn't nearly as rare and difficult to reproduce as a lot of you guys think it is.  Gold IS rare.  It IS *impossible* to reproduce.  No matter how bad people want gold, there's only so much of it to go around.  But the network effect -- it can be manufactured.  It can be recreated and it can be made abundant, not rare.  We've seen that with dogecoin, litecoin, and the 300 other cryptocurrencies that have sprouted up in the last few years.
*Intrinsic* value is basically what you can do with something if nobody else wants it -- if I had some apples, but nobody wanted my apples, I could still eat my apples.  If I had some gold, but nobody wanted it, I could still turn it into jewelry or fill some cavities.  Even if I had some old dirt or wood that nobody wanted... I could plant some food and build a shed with it.  If nobody wants bitcoins, you can't do jack shit with them, you can't even hold them.  That's not a store of value, that's bottled air... or as the very wise Mr. Buffett calls it... "a mirage".

This whole legal marijuana thing is catching on all around the country, all around the world actually...  it won't be long till the federal government comes around and quits being a dick about it.  That'll clear the way for banks to work with these companies.  
Bitcoin doesn't make sense for them now, anyway.  They can't use services like coinbase or bitpay because banks would still be involved...  which means they have to hold those volatile ass coins until they can unload them on the open market.  Fuck that shit.  Not to mention the associated learning curve -- as we see in every single day, sometimes people's bitcoins disappear into thin air -- either because they got hacked, or they accidentally deleted the file, or they forgot their password, or they committed some other easy-to-commit error...  again, fuck that shit -- WAY too much risk. 
We haven't gotten to the part about taxes, accounting, legality or even insurability.  There are major considerations in all of those areas for these companies -- if they're thinking about it, it'd be pretty stupid to not have a thorough consultation with their attorneys and accountants.  It might be a good idea to get a feel for the general thoughts &amp; feelings of their customers as well -- for me personally, I'm looking for profit in btc.  I don't care  about adoption or stability or any of that shit -- I just want to sell higher than what I bought it at - and I do NOT want that profit to be realized in WEED.  I'd bet that the vast majority of people who buy weed with bitcoin would be doing it for the novelty or to show support, not because it makes life easier or solves problems for them.  That's not sustainable. 
There is simply no incentive for me as a customer to *spend* bitcoin -- it's been asked a million times before:  Why would I spend a coin worth $X today when it might be worth $5X tomorrow?  And don't give me that, "why spend ANY dollars on anything but bitcoin then??" bullshit.  Bitcoin is a small percentage of my investment portfolio.  You know, that whole "only put what you're willing to lose into it" thing.  BTC is a gamble. When I go to a casino and buy gambling chips, I'm not looking to spend those chips on milk &amp; bread &amp; gas &amp; weed.  I bought them to GAMBLE.  That's exactly how I think about bitcoins - they're casino chips, and with them, I'm letting it ride, not buying a sack.

No, other protocols would arise with similar capabilities; one of them might be email equivalent of dogecoin... and people would jump to that because it works just as well but with tweaks to make it more usable.

@_date: 2014-08-08 22:47:25


I can't answer that.  I'm sure you have your reasons.  If I had to take a guess I'd say it's to proselytize.  
It's not that I didn't intend to read your second post.  It's that it was just a long-winded reiteration of your first post.  You missed the point the first time -- to just say the same things over again but with more words is a waste of my time.  Your arguments didn't change, and neither did mine.  Wouldn't it be an awesome debate if we just said the same things to eachother over &amp; over again?  Yeah, I don't think so either.  
So I guess, given that, maybe I *can* answer your question.  I didn't read your post because the conversation wasn't about "why bitcoin might not be such a bad idea."  It was about the benefits to the consumer over Paypal.  Bitcoin ISN'T such a bad idea, but saying that is not saying that it has a clear advantage over Paypal for consumers like me.  If it did, I would use it, but it doesn't, so I don't.   That was OP's point, and I agree with him.

Well I could make 10 copies of bitcoin that each has every single property that "the real thing" has.  I can make an EXACT copy of bitcoin if I wanted to.  You can't do that with gold.  There is nothing unique or rare or inherently valuable about bitcoin itself -- I can make an infinite number of currencies that do the exact same thing that bitcoin does.  That shows that cyrptocurrencies -- ALL cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, lack scarcity, one of the most fundamental qualities of being a good currency.  
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:56:18

Well, u/BeardMilk is saying that if he wants to use bitcoin, he has to do a currency conversion in order to use it.  
You're trying to say, "Yeah, try converting currencies in paypal!"  
but that completely misses the fact that *...a currency conversion isn't neccessary with paypal*.  Paypal isn't another currency, it's a service.  There is no need to convert currencies in order to use the service.  
Why would I convert currencies in paypal and then try to compare that experience with converting dollars to bitcoins?  That doesn't make any sense.   I don't need to convert currencies in order to transact with paypal, that's the whole point.

LOL - stack sizes have no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of any given hand.  Implied odds are the modified odds given the possibility of more money entering the pot later.

LOL "positive feedback loop"!?  Really???  
He just described a ponzi scheme - he's saying why bitcoiners might *think* bitcoin is like precious metals, but he fails to mention the fact that any number of cryptocurrencies can be created. There is only so much gold to go around -- period, the end.  Gold can't be manufactured, copied, or changed in any way.  Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, can be made by anybody in the world -- they CAN be created, they CAN be copied, there are 300+ cryptocurrencies already in existence -- I could make 10 more just like bitcoin and suddenly it becomes pretty obvious that that whole "supply is predetermined" thing is a flat out lie.  
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:03:53
Yeah, I'm serious.
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:15:43
Absolutely it is. 
If nobody else in the world wanted your bitcoins, and you just had to own them for the rest of your life, what would you do with them?  What are they good for?  Absolutely nothing.  You need somebody else to WANT your bitcoins for them to have any usefulness at all.  
That's not true with things like gold, silver, copper, hell even DIRT has more intrinsic value than bitcoin does.  Even if nobody else wants those things from me, there's still a lot I can do with them.  
You don't want to be holding a FIAT currency when the demand for them dwindles.  Real assets, like commodities, land, any kind of tangible supplies... those things can be considered money, they can be thought of as wealth, they can be used as currency, but they are not FIAT.  They have real world value in the here and now.  
Bitcoin only ever represents wealth, it never IS wealth.  I sure the hell wouldn't want to be left holding a bunch of it if suddenly demand goes away.   That's the essence of FIAT, and bitcoin categorically fits in.

Yes they both supply equal funds...   *in the beginning*.  But the whole bet is based on the idea that bitcoins are a mirage.  If OP believes they are a mirage, why would he want 600 instead of 300 as his final prize?

Not neccessarily.  You can do derivative/futures trading within the bitcoin economy in both directions, in dollars, with leverage.  If I had 10 billion dollars, I could place a 5 billion dollar hedge against bitcoin companies and then use the other 5 billion to crash the price.  My 5 billion dollars worth of bitcoins might become worth a lot less, but my hedges might pay out big.  It wouldn't be impossible to short (or long) the entire bitcoin economy because it's a small fry in a much bigger economy.  You could theoretically lose your 5 billion dollar "investment" in bitcoin because the price plummets to nothing...  but still make huge profits because you bet cleverly on the other side.  10 billion dollars isn't an unreal amount of money for someone to take a gamble like that, either.  There are several individuals, institutions, funds, etc. that could feasibly go for a hostile takeover of the entire bitcoin economy.

The rest of you get all butthurt when you hear that people are actually warning others about something that you're already hook, line &amp; sinkered on, but that's not my problem.

I think it's funny that you think a vehicle that has fluctuated 10-50% in a single day is going to reliably protect you from 2% (or 20%) yearly inflation.  There are MUCH better hedges against inflation than bitcoin.  The fact that this is the top answer here, to me, is ridiculous.  I wonder how many people here are holding $800+ coins with the idea that they're being protected from inflation LOL
@_date: 2014-08-14 02:08:39
Man I haven't heard that one since it crossed $800.  
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:23:04
Yeah your reasoning is clear alright -- clearly horseshit.  
You haven't substantiated any of your numbers.  20% came out of your ass, $2500 came out of your ass, $10k came out of your ass...  your whole argument is coming straight out of your ass.
OK, YES let's look at THIS YEAR's yearly % "increase" of bitcoin and then apply those numbers for the next 5 years.   
Bitcoin YTD is -25%.  
-25% from $600 puts us at 450 in 2015. 
-25% from $450 puts us at $337 in 2016. 
-25% from $337 = ~ $250 in 2017
-25% from $250 = ~ $187 in 2018
-25% from $187 = ~ $140 in 2019.  
This has been a fun exercise, thanks for playing.

I'm confused why you think Americans have a need for euros.  Trust me I won't be saving in Euro bro.  Most Americans aren't terribly worried about the purchasing power of the Euro either.  It's not really our currency.  Americans don't save in the Euro, they don't spend in the euro, and they don't care about the euro's purchasing power.  THAT is why nobody is pushing for euro adoption in America.

That's a stretch, IMO.  Inherent value is whatever you could do with something if nobody wanted to trade for it.  Even if nobody wanted gold, I could do lots of stuff with it.  Even if nobody wanted wood or dirt, I could do something with it.  Even if nobody wanted to trade for my apple because there are already billions of apples on the market -- I could still eat my apple that nobody wants.  If nobody wanted bitcoin, it would be worthless for anything else.  Instant/anonymous/no middlemen isn't really that impressive.  We've been living in the internet age for a good 30 years now -- the world is FULL of highly valuable bits of information that get sent back and forth around the world, instantly, anonymously and without middlemen.  Hell Napster was doing it back in the 90s.  Video games too. It's not exactly a new, revolutionary concept, the internet has been doing it in one form or another for a long time.   Bitcoin's properties aren't unique -- a company like Paypal or Google could step in and make something better in no time.  Without any inherent value, it could become ABSOLUTELY worthless (ZERO) if demand shifted to something better.

You can't back either of those numbers with anything more than "I hope" or "I wish".  Or "I've postulated that it's very unlikely" haha that's funny.  
I can do that too, watch:  There is no ceiling for gold.  Bitcoin won't ever reach it's previous highs.  That's my "postulation"; I'm obviously much smarter than you, so let's roll with MY numbers instead of yours; I've substantiated them as much as you have.

Well that doesn't mean shit to me.  My life happens to be denominated in dollars, so the fact that they devalue against the dollar is kind of important.    "deflationary in themselves" doesn't make any sense.  Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum; you can't pretend it does.  
edit:  you forgot to tell me, how SAFE would my savings be if I put my life savings into bitcoin in November 2013?  Can you show me any other "savings accounts" that lost 50% of their value this year?  
I'm sorry but I would not put money into bitcoin expecting it to be "saved" as OP suggest.  If I had $25k to put down on a house early next year, I'd feel just fine about putting it into a traditional savings account until it was time to cut the check.  Would I put my $25k down payment in bitcoin, expecting it to be there in a month, or three months, or a year?  HELL the fuck no.  Sure, I might get lucky and make 100x my ~~investment~~ gamble, but I might lose everything I have on the table too.  That's not "saving", that's "gambling".

You can't send real-estate to China instantly either, or coal or corn or wheat or oil or mutual funds... you know why?  Because that's not what those things are for.  Gold is a store of wealth first &amp; foremost - that's why I own it.  Not to buy stuff from China.  If I want to travel with a currency.... this might blow your mind but... dollars work just fine for that.  I've travelled abroad several times and have never had a single issue with my US dollars.   


Oh, I don't know...

Next time you find somebody who bought gold with the intention of trying to buy something online with it, smack them in the head.  That's not what gold is for. 
It's a hedge; a store of value; an asset -- gold is MONEY not a currency, idiots. 
I can't pay for something online with my car or my house either -- know why?  Because those things aren't currencies.  Learning the difference between these two things will do you some good.  [For your edification](

Meh.  That's a stretch.  I mean, look at what you're doing -- you're basically just hacking the system to use bitcoin.  Gyft cards?  Really??  No thanks.  When I can just use it without having to jump through a bunch of hoops, I might do that...  *if* I can secure the coins without a master's degree in engineering, which is NOT the case now.  Like I said, it's not ready for me.  I put more money into penny stocks every week than I put into bitcoin total, and I make bigger margins too.  Gambling is gambling - I can do that anywhere.  It's not like I've been missing out on huge gains *since* I got goxxed now, is it?  If bitcoin is here to stay, it'll be here for me later on.  I'm not worried about losing profits - I make those just fine elsewhere.

There are better ways.  There is actual, real-world wealth, and there is virtual, trust based wealth.  Truly wealthy people have actual, real world assets -- they don't care about digital/virtual accounts and balances, they care about the stuff they physically own, - their land &amp; real estate, their cars &amp; boats &amp; other toys, their jewels and metals...   and of course they have the basics more than covered too - food, water, guns/ammo, etc.  
Smart rich people care about those things anyway.  
You people who think that holding onto almost literally nothing but virtual credits makes you wealthy,  you're crazy.    I'm not going to be left holding a bunch of digital fucking signatures as my nest egg if things don't go according to plan.  I'm stacking real world wealth, shit that I can use, or consume or at least fucking throw.    I can throw pennies.  Those will be more valuable to me than bitcoin will be if this us debt thing truly comes to a head.  A lot of people in this subreddit seemed to agree with Mike Maloney on the subject of bitcoin; at least they expressed as much when MM sang bitcoin's praises.  But if you actually listen to him, he has a much better plan for escaping debt.  Hint: it ain't bitcoin.

But he's not actually touching the bitcoins.  
Bitpay converts them to dollars.  
Here, I'll draw you a picture: 
So if during tulip mania, someone decided to to accept tulips as a form of payment using a service that immediately converted the tulips to dollars without him ever touching the tulips...   
...does that means he's pro tulips?  
Remember, he never actually owns any tulips - he's just letting a company convert other people's tulips into dollars so that they can buy his metals.  With dollars.

Of course I read your post, why the fuck do you think I replied?  
Just like your previous post, you dance around the main point of the OP, making all kinds of peripheral arguments that don't really address the original question, which is "what's in it for the consumer?".  
There is absolutely no difference between domestic vs. international trade for me as a consumer.  I can send a payment to China just as easily as I can to Wyoming.  The fact that the guy in China has to convert from USD to Yen in order to use the payment is of no concern to me.  It gives me absolutely no incentive to use bitcoin over paypal.  
You're trying to compare apples to oranges to explain why bitcoin is better for consumers than paypal is, but it's not working. 
If there was an advantage to using bitcoin over paypal, people like OP, and myself would be taking advantage.  But there isn't - Paypal works just fine for us.  None of what you've written here changes that.

Lol well aren't you a regular warren buffett.  So obviously all this bullshit you've been talking about STORING WEALTH in bitcoin is exactly that -- BULLSHIT -- since you didn't actually store any wealth there -- you speculated your wealth into multiples (much like a craps table) and then CASHED OUT.   You aren't storing wealth there, and I don't fucking blame you.  
You're so impressed with your own "foresight" (lol) that I can almost picture you trying to give yourself a blowjob.  You're obviously convinced that you deserve it, so keep trying buddy, you'll get it.  Where there's a will there's a way.
In the meantime, you obviously don't even know what the hell we're arguing about, you're just arguing.  The bottom line is: bitcoin is NOT a good store of wealth.  Actions speak louder than words -- your actions (liquidating your bitcoin holdings) prove that you agree with me.  If you *had* actually attempted to store your wealth in bitcoin, it'd be worth HALF.

Yes there was. 


Yep.  I bought some neodymium magnets from China today, using paypal.  No conversions neccessary, no extra fees, no premiums.... it was seamless; no different than buying something from Wyoming.  
The fact remains: Paypal is easier to use, cheaper and safer for most people.  Your wall of text doesn't change that bottom line.  I'm as careful and thoughtful as anybody else when it comes to my money -- like I said before, if I saw an advantage for bitcoin over paypal, I'd seize it.  But there isn't one, paypal works fine.

"Do you want to lose your money over decades, or overnight??
LOL pretty easy choice. :D
Do you understand why "zoom out" is significant here? I have a feeling you don't.
At any rate, I can answer your question.  


Uhh... because the dollar is very stable.  If you watched the USD price nonstop you'd be very bored because it doesn't move much on a daily, weekly, monthly or even a yearly basis.  1-2% year over year beats the shit out of 45% in a few months or 10-50% in a day.    
If you seriously think the USD is as volatile or risky (or moreso) than bitcoin you're high on crack.

No they can't, there is no liquidity.  They can TRY to dump their shares, but as we've clearly seen, they aren't really moving at these prices.  You can put your GBTC shares up for sale at $42 or $55 or whatever you want -- whether they actually sell or not is another story.

When you invest in stocks, you're giving a company your money for R&amp;D or product development or marketing or whatever...  you're "investing" in that company so that they can use the capital to improve their business.  Bitcoin is NOTHING like that bro.

That assumes you KNOW the price will always go up, for ever and ever.  We DON'T know that.  It's a volatile, risky investment that could go either way.  THAT is why you don't put every last dollar you own into it -- becaus it's risky.   I think of bitcoins like I think of casino chips -- I didn't buy them to buy groceries &amp; gas.  I bought them to GAMBLE.  I don't bring every last dollar to the casino for the same reason I won't put every last dollar into bitcoin -- because there is NO guarantee.

I know reading is hard but you should really learn, it's super handy.  
YES, EuroPac does have ONE mutual fund that invests heavily in gold.  ONE of SEVEN. That fund makes up about 15% of EuroPac's mutual fund offerings.  The other SIX mutual fund offerings (or 85%) do not invest in precious metals at all.  You missed that part, obviously.  
 **EuroPac International Value Fund (EPIVX)**
The Euro Pacific International Value Fund is a new mutual fund that offers investors of varied means access to a diversified, actively managed portfolio. The fund seeks to provide capital appreciation and income, and is run by the same team heading up our wealth management division: Peter Schiff, as the Investment Committee Chairperson, and Jim Nelson, CFA, as the Portfolio Manager.
The fund seeks to help diversify currency risk by investing in a number of countries with positive macro-economic fundamentals (including trade surpluses, low government debt, high interest rates relative to other developing nations, and low inflation – just to name a few). It is an alternative way to take advantage of Euro Pacific’s global investment approach.
**EuroPac International Dividend Income Fund (EPDPX)**
The Euro Pacific Dividend Income Fund attempts to maximize expected dividend income outside of the United States, using a top-down analysis to select the best currencies and sectors, and a bottom-up analysis to select the securities with the most potential to pay out high and sustainable dividends that grow. The strategy seeks to diversify currency risk and takes a long-term investment view with low portfolio turnover.
**EuroPac Latin America Fund (EPLAX)**
EP Latin America Fund (EPLAX) is a new mutual fund that seeks long term capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of growing but stable Latin American companies of any market capitalization, that the team believes are trading at attractive valuations relative to anticipated growth in revenue and earnings. The strategy is targeted towards US-based investors who are concerned about global inflation, growing fiscal deficits and below-trend growth rates that are challenging the investment outlook for mature economies.
**EuroPac Asia Small Companies Fund (EPASX)**
The Euro Pacific Asia Small Companies Fund seeks to achieve long term capital appreciation by investing at least 80% of its net assets, which include borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities of small capitalization companies located in the Asian countries of China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The fund sub-advisors will focus on dividend paying small cap companies that they believe are stable, financially sound, and capable of growth.
**EuroPac International Bond Fund (EPIBX)**
The EuroPac International Bond Fund’s investment objective is to seek current income and capital appreciation. The fund invests primarily in investment grade government bonds, with the remainder dedicated to what the management team believes are undervalued corporate bonds from companies in attractive sectors with improving fundamentals.
The fund is run by Investment Committee Chairperson Peter Schiff and portfolio manager Jim Nelson, CFA, the same team that runs the EuroPac International Value Fund, and Euro Pacific Capital’s wealth management division.
**EuroPac China Fund (EPHCX)**
The EP China Fund uses a value oriented strategy with a long term focus on financially sound, stable but growing, dividend paying Chinese companies. The Fund believes that China will continue to grow faster over the long term than many developed countries due to the emerging middle class, strong consumer balance sheets, a fiscally conservative government and ongoing market deregulation. To benefit from these trends, the Fund is focused exclusively on finding those companies best positioned to benefit from the underlying fundamental strength in China. In our quest to generate attractive returns and limit downside risk for our shareholders, we balance the strong growth outlook for many Chinese companies with valuation and the company’s ability and willingness to pay dividends.
**EuroPac Gold Fund (EPGFX)**
The EP Gold Fund will attempt to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing in precious metals, precious metal producers and precious metal exploration and prospecting companies. While the Fund may invest in different types of precious metals, 80% or more of net assets will be invested in gold-related investments. The Fund is sub-advised byAdrian Day, of Adrian Day Asset Management, a well-regarded resource investor, who has managed precious metal investments since 1991.
The EuroPac Gold Fund uses a top-down approach to screen for and select attractive markets and sectors, and a bottom-up valuation approach to select securities, and focuses on a long-term investment horizon in order to realize value. The Fund's distinct allocation across precious metal sectors attempts to maximize upside while minimizing risk. The Advisor will focus on depressed major miners, high growth juniors as well as exploration companies. In attempting to minimize risk in the Fund, the Advisor will emphasize royalty companies (within the major miner space) and prospecting companies (within the exploration space).

It's a chicken &amp; egg kind of thing though - I personally don't think it's viable as a currency because the volatility is basically inherent to the design.  Everybody keeps talking about market cap like it's the only thing that matters to the stability of a currency.  If 7 billion people each aquired $2 worth of bitcoin, sure that works great to decrease volatility -- but what happens if one single investor decided to acquire $15 billion worth?  Does that increased market cap still decrease volatility?  The answer is: NO.  Volatility greatly *increases* in that scenario. 
Commodity, maybe.  Currency, no.  And again, I don't think it will ever work as a currency because not only will it always be volatile, but also  because there's more incentive to hold it than to spend it.  I still own a little bitcoin and I have no desire whatsoever to spend it.  I never will. It's a speculative instrument for me and that's all it'll ever be.

I don't buy ANY of these assumptions you're hoping I'll just go along with.  The NSA is compromising *American* technology... and the PRC is compromising Chinese technology...  where are you getting YOUR technology?  You're building printers from scratch, yourself?  Oh okaaay.  LOL  
And... is that your workaround?  To just forego ALL American and Chinese made technology?  heh, let me know how that works out for you.  
 &gt; Bitcoin isnt perfect but it is by far the best damn improvement to both security and finance that is unparralled by any private effort.
(at least that's what people who claim to be really smart keep telling me.) lol
I've seen smart people saying the exact opposite, so there's that.  
tl;dr: "The only security expert enthusiastic about Bitcoin’s potential as an anti-fraud mechanism for consumers was Kat Brown, project manager at SatoshiDICE.com."
Now THERE'S a surprise! haha!

That's all just your opinion and personal belief -- nothing you wrote here indicates a strong case.  PayPal Coulda Shoulda Woulda....  according to you and all your bitcoiner friends...  
The simple counter to your argument is: PayPal isn't in business to be "widely good for society".  (And even if they were, there's no empirical evidence that bitcoin contributes to that end).  PayPal is in business to be "widely good for it's shareholders".  There is no bullying, there is no monopoly going on here -- you're welcome to head over Overstock.com or whatever other merchant you want, but if Ebay &amp; Paypal decide that they don't want you to use their services for certain purposes, there's nothing you can do about it.

Not to mention the learning curve.  I guarantee you that if more companies start accepting btc, we're going to hear a lot more stories of accounts getting hacked, lost/deleted .dat files, forgotten passwords, etc. etc.   If these companies move to BTC without thinking VERY hard about it, they're going to learn a lot of things the  hard way.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't think learning the hazards and downfalls of a new payment system as you go sounds very appealing for most business owners.    
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:19:34

Bitcoin's intrinsic value is ZERO.  
when you ask yourself, "What would this be good for if nobody else wanted it?", you should get your answer.  
With gold, even if nobody else wants it, you can still fill a cavity or make a necklace or something.  
With guns, if nobody wants it, you can still shoot a deer or some asshole with it. 
Hell even rocks &amp; dirt &amp; wood...  if nobody wants those things you can throw them or burn them or build something with them.  
What can you do with a bitcoin if nobody else wants it?  Absolutely nothing.

Sure.  I've gambled with it.  That's it.  Just like buying some casino chips and taking that shit to the craps table -- I bought 5 bitcoins at $30 (when it crossed silver).  I sold 4 of them for $820 each.  I was daytrading with the other one at Mt.Gox, and wasn't doing too bad... but then you know what happened next.  Gox'd. 
And that was it.  No more bitcoin for me.  I decided it's not ready for me, or I'm not ready for it.  One of the two, maybe both.  Interesting idea, great gamble, otherwise no thanks.  Mt. Gox put a bad smell in the air for me.  I had a table full of winnings swept clean for no reason.   C'est la vie - bitcoin was a gamble, and sometimes gambling sucks. 
Yes, I paid my capital gains.

Nobody said anything about not being careful.  I'm curious where YOU got the impression that I said anything like that.  Bitcoin is billed as the end-all work-around to all the "conventional" obstacles of moving large amounts of money around.  Clearly it isn't.  Of course there's thinking involved in trying to get out of bitcoin -- in fact it takes *more* thinking to get out of bitcoin than it does most other assets.    
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:24:28
Neither of us made any ~~anticipation~~ predictions.

Yeah, I guess it is easier for you to just pretend his arguments aren't there than to actually address them.  Whatever bro.  I'm not going to repeat them for you, they're in the video -- 10 minutes worth.

@_date: 2015-01-16 01:41:09


Ok, I'm waiting.  
ps. because you're so dense, let me clarify.  We're not talking about 13 months of data.  We're talking about decades worth of 13-month periods.  You know, historical data.  Go get those numbers for me bro, I'll be right here.  


What do you mean "validity"?  We're talking about REALITY.  Do you really need to validate reality?  Are you hoping that it's going to tell you WHY?  Or what to expect?  Because it isn't.  It's just data.  There's no need to question its validity, because it's reality.  It actually happened.  There's nothing to validate.  Bitcoin was the worst performing currency in 2014, and that's a fact.  You don't have to assign any meaning to it if you don't want to.  But you can't change the fact.  


Dude, come on.  Focus.  We're not talking companies.  We're talking currencies.  There are no special fiscal years for currencies.  They're ALL measured year over year.

That's cool, it wouldn't take anywhere near half a billion dollars to manipulate the price anyway.  I just used that number to make a point - no need to get stuck on it.  My point stands:  big traders can move the market up AND down if they want to.  
By the way: exchanges aren't the only places you can borrow BTC from.  
you guys can downvote till your hearts are content, it doesn't make this statement untrue.  :)
LOL lots of downvotes, zero responses.  Nice par @_date: 2015-01-08 21:44:36
Well that's stupid.  An ounce of gold is valued at ~$1200, a bitcoin is valued at ~$280.  Do you see how these two numbers do NOT equate?

The fact that the entire planet is on that timeframe kinda makes it not arbitrary.  Is it arbitrary that we as a planet have chosen 365 days as a year?  Sure.

@_date: 2015-01-21 19:06:14
No, it's a fact. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:20:47
Yeah, we're not talking about expenditures and such, we're talking about currencies, remember?  Currencies are measured year-over-year. EVERY YEAR.  This isn't something new for 2015, where all the media outlets around the world decided to try &amp; make bitcoin look bad.   Nope, they're just reporting the facts.  Just like they do every single year.  
I know you don't like the numbers, but they are what they are.  It's a fact: bitcoin was the worst performing currency of 2014.  There is no disputing it, sorry.  You don't have to attach any meaning to that fact if you don't want to, but it remains a fact nevertheless. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 19:58:59
Price has nothing to do with it.  Holding 100% of your wealth in bitcoin, whether you paid today's prices or 2009's prices - is kinda nuts.  If Andreas held 99/100% of his wealth in bitcoin through 2014, he watched his entire net worth fall by 60%.  Who cares if spends what he earns?

You could have taken your item to a local flea market and not paid ANY fees (except for the cost of your space).

Uhh...  21 million coins, each infinitely divisible.  There are A LOT more units of bitcoin than there are units of gold in the world.  Sorry bro but gold is much more rare than bitcoin will ever be.  You can divide one bitcoin into a hundred million units, and with a fork that number could be a hundred billion or a hundred trillion.  Let me see you try &amp; divide an ounce of gold like that.  You can't -- do you know why?  Because unlike bitcoin, gold is finite.

If somebody says something to you in Greek, the fact that you don't understand what they said doesn't mean they didn't say anything.  It just means you don't understand.

I'm not the one who implied that.  I'm just relaying what's been implied to me.  Don't shoot the messenger.  What have you bitcoiners been raving about if it's not the ability to move big money easily quickly and cheaply?  What's the difference between moving a million dollars from one person to another vs. just cashing out a million dollars?  If I can't liquidate a million dollars worth of bitcoin quickly, easily and cheaply, then surely I can't *send* a million dollars quickly, easily and cheaply either.  I mean,  I thought you guys said it was a payment processor.  The fact that it's billed as both a frictionless, instantaneous, basically free payment processor AND a volatile, risky investment instrument with major tax implications... just doesn't jibe with me.  It's one or the other, not both.  I don't pay capital gains on my paypal transactions, do you?  It's absolutely feasible to get hit with capital gains on a BTC transaction though.  Yeah, it's not a no-brainer to pull a million dollars out of ANY asset.  But that's not the point.

Then why don't I file my taxes on a per-minute, per-hour, per-day or per-millennium timeframe?  Why don't corporations file earnings reports on those timeframes?  Why isn't inflation, or GDP, or national debt, or employment, or ANYTHING for that matter, reported on those timeframes?  
Sorry but you're full of shit -- yearly data is a standard timeframe for just about anything in the world that deals with money.  
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:14:47
Well, if we follow the logic from my comment to yours, we can feel confident in the final conclusion that YOU, sir, are stupid.  VERY stupid. :)  
And guess what -- I'm not going to stop reading/commenting here!  Pathetic, I know.  Too bad there's nothing you can do about it, huh?  LOL
@_date: 2014-01-18 00:12:13
Lol really?  If I have to explain that you're not ready for this discussion.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:11:58
Bitcoin's 2014 was compared to all other currencies' 2014.  
If they were comparing bitcoin's 2014 to the USD's January of 2014, or JPY Q1, you might have a point.  But we're comparing 365 days to 365 days -- so you don't.   
I have to admit that 365 days isn't materially different from one day, or 30 days, or 90 days??  LOL okay.... no.   
@_date: 2015-01-17 11:31:28
The real question you should be asking is, are these virtual tokens worth JACK SHIT?   I mean, without the manipulation they may never have broken above $20.

Cool.  Thanks for caring &amp; sharing. 
Do you have anything to add to this conversation, other than that? 
Edit:  I thought not.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:28:44
It wasn't an "arbitrary" timeline, it was a yearly summary.  That's not arbitrary, that's pretty fucking standard.

If you want any of that money to eventually make it to your legitimate accounts, you're going to have to launder the shit out of it.

Again -- go find me all the historical data you can find for 13-month-over-13-month periods so that we can compare the most recent 13-month period to it.  OH we don't have any??  Well we DO have a a hundred years worth of year-over-year data -- it makes a little bit of sense to compare THIS year to all those other years, doesn't it?  Sorry buddy, there's absolutely nothing arbitrary about measuring a currency's performance over a 1 year period.

That's kind of a stupid question. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:54:30
Wrong.  The answer is: NO.  Tulips were never worth that much.  There was a speculative surge that made a lot of people pay a LOT more than they were worth (hoping they'dbe "worth" a lot more later), but that doesn't mean they were actually worth what they paid.  The going price eventually fell back to their true value, which was hundredths of what people paid for them.  
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:56:18
Well, I didn't call it at every price - I called it at &gt;$1000.  You can insist that it wasn't obvious, but it WAS obvious enough to me that I kept my $$ as far away from bitcoin as possible in 2014.  Maybe I didn't "KNOW" but I had a damn strong inclination, and again.... it was correct.  
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:20:41

@_date: 2014-02-07 22:29:33
You may not trust or believe those guarantees, but that doesn't really change the fact that most of the world does.  What you or I think of the government's promises doesn't change the fact that that's where the dollar's value is derived from.  We can argue the meanings of the words or the functions behind the meanings -- at the end of the day, I'm sticking to my guns -- the USD has value because the government makes those guarantees; whether they have meaning to you or not doesn't matter.
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:17:44
He didn't say anything about needing a system of trust (or a trustless system), he's just talking about transacting  value.  It's all great that bitcoin can do that without trust, but that's not really the problem he's trying to solve.
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:02:47
So...  bitcoin is not really "scarce" then, is it.  21 million coins, infinitely divisible -- means there is an infinite number of units, not 21 million.  I'd like to see one of you try &amp; divide an ounce of gold into a hundred million units.

@_date: 2015-01-16 17:30:20
Oh, I couldn't help myself.  I had to see it.  
So you bought between 60 and 100, watched it go all the way up to $1266 but HELD (lmfao) all the way through the crash to $250, and then watched it go up again to what, $800?  And then watched it go all the way back down to $200 again....  and you think that was a good ride!!???  hahaha that's so fucking funny.  
Don't try to backtrack your way out of it bro -- the last time it was $60-$100 was 2 bubble/crashes ago, and you held through them both.  You missed the boat bigtime, twice. LOL

You should probably notify all the financial media outlets who reported the year-over-year facts, not me.  You're acting like I'm the one who arbitrarily decided to compare bitcoin's year to other currencies.  I'm not.  No, this isn't something arbitrary, that somebody pulled together for the first time in 2015 just to make bitcoin look bad.  Nope, these comparisons happen every single year.  THIS year, you're pissed about it though, because bitcoin DOES look bad.  Oh well, you can be pissed about it - but being pissed isn't going to change the fact that it's true.

Yeah, why don't you show me a historical list of all the 370-day or 350-day spans where things like this were measured, so we an compare.  
Oh, there are no 370-day or 350-day reports that we can compare this one to?  Well shit, what will we do?  I mean, we have decades of year-over-year data, but comparing THIS year to all those other years of historical data is arbitrary, isn't it.  
"predictive validity"????  What the fuck are you talking about.  Comparing historical performance data of one currency against several others has absolutely no predictive value whatsoever.  
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:18:06

Peter is laying pot odds because he believes the probability odds are in his favor, and so do I.  I don't expect you to understand that, but if you ever get your head around it this whole thing will make a lot more sense to you.   I'd take bad pot odds with high probability odds any day of the week.  That's all Peter's doing.   Pot odds are in Amagi guy's favor, but that has no bearing on the actual outcome of the bet.  Wagering 101, very basic stuff.  
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:30:41
You're confusing terms.  There's a difference between money and currency.  Money does in fact need to have intrinsic value to be considered money.  Your definition of money is actually the definition of currency, not money.  Anyway, this whole conversation with you is annoying because you keep making points that don't really have anything to do with the original discussion which was about gold vs. bitcoin.  I've said it before, I really mean it this time:  I can't do this with you - see ya.

It's really a crapshoot.  It *might* be an awesome investment if you're lucky enough for it to not disappear into thin air like it so frequently does, but it's very likely to be a terrible investment too, because, well, it might disappear into thin air.

By saying you're up 900%, you're saying that the coins in your possession right now cost you $20.  $215 is roughly 900% on $20...  so you DID hold your $20 coins up to $1266 and then back down again.  If you sold at $800 like you say you did, you'd be up a lot more than 900%.  But nope, you're only up 900%, per your own admission...  so great job holding your $20 coins up to $1266 and back down again bro -- you are one savvy investor!  (Or a bold-faced liar!) :)

It IS a good question.  What happens if a LOT of CP or other illegal content shows up in the blockchain in the form of packeted data?   Putting it together on your own isn't that big of a task, and there'd be plenty of people willing to do it.  You wouldn't need a service, it could be done in a standalone, easily distributed, privately executable script or app.  If the blockchain becomes littered with strings of data that contain illegal content, a market will arise to gather and translate that content into it's intended form.  
If it's simply impossible, fine.  But if it's possible, it should absolutely be a concern.

NOPE.  Sorry bud, *that* is indeed patently false.  There's no sense in squirming around trying to make a different point now, because that's flimsy as fuck too. Yahoo was well underway in developing web marketing models that are now used ubiquitously, and Google wasn't far behind.   I don't need a wikipedia link to know that, kid.  
Only stupid people laughed at suggestions to use the internet for marketing 20 years ago.  *Smart* people were *scrambling* to advertise on the internet 20 years ago.  That's how &amp; why web marketing got to be where it is today.

Hate to break it to you but they aren't going with option B...  
@_date: 2015-03-10 07:00:40


Yeah but... erm... it doesn't really do that.  
Bitcoin is a store of value like casino chips are a store of value.  
The most important thing when it comes to storing value is reliably retrieving the value at a later date.  Volatility is bad, mmmkay?  If I'd have put $40k into a savings account at the beginning of 2014, expecting to buy a house at the beginning of 2015, I'd've been relatively sure that my $40k was still worth about $40k.  It's not going "to the moon", but that's not the point - it's not supposed to go to the moon.  It's supposed to be there when I need it.  
If you'd have put that same $40k into bitcoin, it'd be worth less than half right now; that is basically the antithesis of "wealth storage".  
@_date: 2015-03-27 23:20:08

@_date: 2015-03-01 17:04:00
Meanwhile, nobody here has addressed very credible arguments or his very relevant points.  Nobody has "substantially refuted" anything he's written.  
But you're right, "good things could maybe happen with digital money" is a pretty rock solid stance, pretty hard to argue with that one.  
edit: fuck.  can't believe I said had good arguments.  I changed it to say what I really meant.  aminok's arguments are shit - totes-mcgotes-brotes is the one telling it like it is.

Here's a Harvard Business Review article, written in 1995.  They weren't laughing.  
And here are some Web Marketing awards from 1995.  
And here is a definition of the word "cybermarketing", from 1995:
"Cybermarketing is the type of marketing that is carried out through computers and telecommunications networks.  The internet and its multimedia presentation, the Web, proide a unique environment for cybermarketing.  The core features of Internet based marketing include interactivity, multimedia usage, on-line control and global reach.

No, that "promise" is completely worthless for spending in the BTC sense. You can "spend" it about as well as you can "spend" GLD or SLV.  


How the hell do you figure that? lol


The trading company NEVER has to buy or sell BTC when someone buys or sells GBTC.  NEVER. They could buy &amp; sell Berkshire Hathaway stocks instead if they wanted to.  
I'm paranoid because I addressed the people who downvoted me?  If that's not you, who cares - I wasn't talking to you, so no need to get your feelers hurt.
Oh yeah, and another thing: only the absolute  dumbest of investors thinks they're buying redeemable gold or silver or oil with GLD, SLV or WTI.  Some of those idiots will surely buy GBTC, thinking they now own some real bitcoin.   Your target market for this stock is people who don't understand what they're doing, LOL.  Congrats.

I was right here on Earth.  
Email was part of the impetus behind the internet itself -- the network effect of early email systems is what the internet grew out of.  Email has never been a fringe thing.  It's at the core, one of pinnacle ancestors of modern telecommunication -- not because people were reluctant to use it, but because everybody was using it, even before adequate infrastructure was in place to support it.  The internet was built around email because email is what people knew how to do, it's what they *were* doing more than anything else related to the internet.

There are no bitcoins on the stock market.  There are only stocks on the stock market.

And the global population grows exponentially.  Even with 3% growth every year, that's not enough to keep up; every single year there is less &amp; less gold for each person.

The biggest part of what banks do is lend money.  So, how exactly does "being your own bank with bitcon" make lending yourself money to buy a house or a car easy?  I know it's fun to say "I can be my own bank" but just being in physical possession of your bitcoins isn't really being a bank, it's pretty much the same as just keeping cash under your matress.

Why do you guys keep calling this a way to buy bitcoin?  It's not buying bitcoin, it's buying stock.  It's like owning GLD or SLV -- that's not "a way to buy gold or silver via a third party trust" - it's a stock, just like GBTC.   You can't redeem GLD or SLV for gold or silver, and you can't redeem GBTC for bitcoins.  
Here's the kicker: No self respecting goldbug or silverbug owns much GLD or SLV because, as they say, "if you don't hold it, you don't own it".   It's no different with GBTC and bitcoins - you won't hold it, so  you won't own it.

Because they're different metals.  Gezus you fuckers like to take any little crumb you can find and run with it - I never said gold ONLY got it's value from it's industrial uses.  I said it's industrial uses contribute to it's value.  For some of gold's applications, there is no substitute, and that adds value.  Sorry, I don't care how much you want to argue about it -- thats the truth.   
As to why silver is so low relative to gold, well that's another story.  First of all, check the historical gold:silver ratio.  You'll see that throughout most of history, silver has been more valuable than gold.  It's way out of whack now - why?   I think silver prices are suppressed via paper markets, and that real a physical shortage is likely.  That's another can of worms, however, and it has nothing to do with the fact that gold does indeed get some of its value from industrial uses.

Intellectual honesty requires expenditure; apparently you've not lifted a finger.  
You obviously know jack shit about goldbuggery, because no self respecting gold bug stores his gold in somebody else's vault.  "If you don't hold it, you don't own it" is a mantra that started with goldbugs, not bitcoiners. 
The counter to your argument is that nobody buys gold to transact over the internet with it, that's not what it's for.  
edit: LOL downvoted.  Go talk to some goldbugs bro - they'll ALL tell you exactly what I just said here.  If you don't like it, that's okay - but downvoting isn't going to change anything.

He's a lot more than a goldbug.  He's a commodity bug in general and a foreign stock &amp; foreign currency bug as well.  You seem to think that he was just born a goldbug -- do you realize that he started as a stock broker for Shearson Lehman?   He saw the turmoil that we were heading for and he ran for cover in gold.  And you know what?  That was a brilliant move.  He's not just a goldbug because he likes gold -- he's a goldbug because he knows that the economy is in big trouble and that gold will protect him from that.  If seeking a safe place to store wealth through tumultuous times makes him a goldbug, then that's what most of is as well. You're looking for a safe haven in "gold 2.0", so you're just as much a gold bug as he is, but you think you've found the "new &amp; improved" gold.

You could divide a single bitcoin infinitely, and each of the fractional pieces you create wouldn't be any different from the others; every single one of them would have the exact same properties, whether you divided by a  billion or a trillion or a quadrillion.   Try doing that with gold and eventually you'll be trying to split atoms.  
Sorry but bitcoin is NOT truly finite.  It may be arbitrarily finite at the moment, but to OPs point, that's only because people have agreed to that.  If they wanted to, it could be INfinite.  Arbitrary, nonliteral limits are exactly that - arbitrary and nonliteral.

So the "only a limited number of bitcoins will ever be mined" thing is a myth?  I mean, OK, so there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever mined.  With 8 decimal places, that equates to  21x10^14 units of exchange.  Add one decimal place, you now have 20x10^15 units.  Next thing you know it's going to cost  .0000000000000000000001btc just to buy a loaf of bread.

LOL no he isn't.  He's one of the most UNdiversified people on the planet and his philosophy on diversification is well known.  
"I am willing to concentrate quite heavily in what I believe to be the best investment opportunities recognizing very well that this may cause an occasional very sour year - one somewhat more sour, probably, than if I had diversified more. While this means our results will bounce around more, I think it also means that our long-term margin of superiority should be greater."

Not really.  He invests in businesses, big and small.   We can do that too, just not on the same scale.  The undiversified philosophy works for non-billionaires too -- if you have the financial knowhow to pick winners, big or small, diversification only reduces your profits.  If you're simply letting a financial advisor or mutual fund adminisrator drive the investments in your 401k/index/mutual fund/etc, by all means, diversify because you don't know wtf you're doing.

About as much intrinsic value as some world of warcraft gold.
I have no problem with BTC speculators.  As I said, that's what i'm doing with BTC as well.  But that's not what it's designed for; speculators will wreak havoc on its usefulness as an everyday currency and that will be it's downfall.  I'm not sorry.  Glad you're not either.

I bought 1 BTC at about $220 earlier this year, just to dive in and try to understand.  I've since spent, lost or given away most of it...  it seems simple enough but when I read technical stuff like what you just spouted, it's sort of a deterrent for me -- I don't want so much responsibility in making sure my money doesn't just flat out disappear.  I've read horror stories of people losing lots of money because they did something "stupid" and their bitcoins became inaccessible or lost or whatever they become.   I never really understand why - people try to explain but it always gets all jargony like what you just wrote, and it just makes me glad I don't have to understand because I don't have any anyway.  
tl;dr: all that techy jargon (and I'm a software developer!) intimidates me.

Like I said before, they'd make a fortune long before ever making the currency untrustworthy.  What do you suppose their profits look like at 5, 10, 20, 30 percent?  Still nothing to be gained there, right?  lol  And when they finally get to 51, the value plummets and nobody trusts it, just like it happened earlier this year when the guild approached majority...  right?

Depends on what you compare it to.  
Compared to pork bellies, which "erode to zero" in a matter of days... it makes an excellent store of value.  
Compared to something like bitcoin, that could go "POOF" in the night and FLASH (not erode) to zero...   it makes an excellent store of value.

I know this is really hard to understand, but... see.... I've only been alive for a certain number of years.  When I use the word "my" it sort of narrows the timeframe for you.  See, I wasn't alive in 1900.  So giving me stats about eroding puchasing power from 1920 doesn't really show how MY purchasing power eroded.    Should I draw you a picture?  I totally will.

I think the writing is on the wall.  This is a speculative bubble.  The value that all these bitcoiners keep talking about just isn't there.  They really *hope* and *wish* and *pray* that it's there, but it isn't.
I'd love to see bitcoin succeed, but I'm about 95% sure it won't because of all the speculation and subsequent volatility happening around it.  Nobody's here to use it as an everyday currency -- we're all here looking to make a buck out of thin air.  Why would a site like Amazon ever start accepting a "currency" (I hate using that word for it, it's more of a commodity in my book) when it's so volatile?  I could have spent a $266 bitcoin today on a nice product from amazon -- that very same bitcoin might be worth less than $100 tomorrow, or it could be $350.  I don't think Amazon is in the business of gambling on extremely high risk instruments that barely resemble a currency.  If I was Amazon I wouldn't touch BTC with a 10-foot pole.  I put a very small amount of USD into btc, and I'm just enjoying the ride.  I would enjoy a fiery crash and burn just as much as a rocket ride to the moon.

I'm not wrong.  There are roughly 10 billion ounces of gold in the world.  It can not be infinitely divided like bitcoin can.  There is a point where, there just isn't enough to go around - no matter how small you divide it up.  Everybody on earth can have some bitcoin if we just add enough zeroes.  
It's hypothetical - you don't know why bitcoins would be subdivided.  If we're at $10 million per bitcoin and need to expand, it may or may not mean they're worth more.  It could very well mean we NEED more to avoid collapse, given that it'd be our current powers that be that allowed it to become the dominant currency and reach 10 million a coin.
Anyway.  All I really wanted to say was: bitcoins aren't like gold &amp; silver certificates.  Not at all.  New rule: no telling people they're wrong a lot when the very first thing you say is wrong.  Good luck with that speculative-savings-spending-investment thing you were telling me about.    
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:41:39
This is actually a huge point.   Bitcoins specifically might be scarce and limited, but the implementation can be reproduced indefinitely.  That makes the whole "scarce and limited" thing seem artificial.  You can't just make another version of gold, and then another and then another...  The supply of this "material" that OP speaks of is infinite.  The supply of the material known as gold, however, is actually, physically limited.

Fortunately for Amazon and Paypal, a ddos attack doesn't leave people helpless while the value of their holdings evaporates.  "Just stop trading" is all well and good if you believe the price will simply bounce back.  But if btc doesn't quickly make back 100% of what it's losing throughout the day, then "just stop trading" isn't really a good solution for protecting your position. 
edit:  So how did that "just stop trading" thing work out for you?  Your holdings went from $266x to $120x, but hey at least you did your part to stop the shenanigans, right?  I sold at $262, and I may or may not buy back in.  My whole goal with BTC was to make a quick buck on some of you suckers -- mission accomplished.

And if a big price drop happens while a site like MtGox is down as it is now, it could be disasterous for a LOT of people.  I've been saying all along that I don't trust BTC as a currency.  As a speculative opportunity, I love it.  I've been day trading like a motherfucker over the last month or two and I've made a killing.  But do I plan on holding BTC long term, or using it as intended -- as an everyday currency?  Hell the fuck no.  I'm playing this flip game to make a few bucks on a few poor suckers...  but I'm quite positive that at some point in the near future, somebody's going to be left holding a very worthless bag.

That's called "# of shares outstanding".  Just one more variable -- should I add another?  How about this... 
 Ever notice how markets get more volatile around elections?  What do you suppose causes that?  Does the market cap of the whole world suddenly shrink during presidential elections?  That's not a serious question - please don't answer.  The answer is: NO.

On MtGox.  I don't have any kind of scientific method, and I don't do anything complex -- I just watch the charts and try to pick highs &amp; lows.  I know it's investing sacrilege, but it's been pretty easy to do in this market lately.  It's just play money anyway.  Most of my holdings are in other securities - I'm a big PMs guy and I also have some other investments that I take much more seriously than this BTC thing.  I could be wrong, but I don't believe there are any legitimate ways to short the market... so for me, it's all about making good guesses in a timely manner.  Amateurish and risky, I know, but fuckit - it's been working great so far -- I am perfectly fine with losing all of it, if that were to happen.  I view my BTC holdings as I would view a moneyclip after a trip to the ATM in the MGM grand: Play Money.

I watched all these vids before OP posted them here -- while I do disagree with a lot of what Duane says about BTC, he does also have some valid points.   I personally don't want anything to do with bitcoin because I don't trust it.  It's too dependent on infrastructure, technology and hardware for one thing, and it's not truly anonymous like everybody seems to think it is.  On top of that, it's viability as a currency is suspect to me because nobody actually uses it as a currency; participants in BTC are speculators and nothing more.  The small market cap makes for extreme volatility and enables big investors to make even bigger waves.  A Warren Buffet or Eric Sprott or Ali Babba or whoever could step in with a billion or so dollars and completely disrupt the BTC market.  Chris Duane does build a few straw man arguments about BTC which are absolutely detrimental to his credibility -- but he IS credible about some of the potential downfalls of BTC nonetheless.

Nah, I've got better, safer places to store my wealth than the USD.  Just because the USD is a better store of value than bitcoin is, it doesnt' mean there aren't better stores of wealth than BOTH.  
I definitely won't be putting all of my wealth into the violently turbulent bitoin market hoping to "store value", I can promise you that much lol...  
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:17:05
You're still not proving your point.  You had to pick the extreme ends of the timeframe to show a decrease in purchasing power in USD.  I chose December 3rd to December 30th OF THIS YEAR to demonstrate the same loss in purchasing power for BTC.  But you INSIST that the bitcoin is a more stable store of value??? LOL  
I'm not blowing smoke up your ass -- if you don't see that it took one currency a decade to lose the same amount of buying power that it took another currency less than a month to lose...   no amount of math is going to help you.  
Oh yeah, and I never changed anything.  The "challenge" was to demonstrate how **MY** purchasing power has eroded -- the only thing that changed was your comprehension of that concept.

You address like it's full of nothing but allies.  Don't you think that some malevolent folks out there might see a message like this and think to themselves... "hmmmmmmm"?  
It's like, sometimes when news stations do stories about vulnerabilities in airline security.  Sometimes I want to say "SHUT UP!!!  Don't fucking tell the general public, (including terrorists!) where all the vulnerabilities are.  
I've got very little btc - I'm really just a spectator so... whatever happens happens.  I don't care either way.  I'm hoping for either a ride to the moon or a spectacular crash &amp; burn.  I'll be disappointed if one or the other doesn't happen.

I don't see anything about gold and silver certificates.  Neither of those sites accepts [these]( for gold and silver.  If that's where btc is headed, you did NOT invest wisely.

tl;dr.  Sorry.   I don't really care what your point was -- I saw a bunch of horsehit jibberish and had to chime in.  You made a pretty strong implication that the reason economists don't like bitcoin is that they're human beings.  That's pretty dumb.  lol

"demonstrably true" my ass.  Yeah you can model volatility as it relates to market cap but you'd have to make assumptions about LOTS of other variables, making your "objective" result not very objective at all.  You can't really call it empirical evidence when 90% of your data is assumed.  Your premise that a larger market, by definition, MUST be less volatile is flawed.  
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:39:23
You might want to look up the word "stable".  
By definition the USD is more stable than bitcoin.  I know you want to believe otherwise (you're welcome to) but it is what it is.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:22:11

The thought experiment assumes bitcoin to be THE dominant payment system.  If it isn't that, the whole experiment kind of falls flat.  You can't claim the value of the entire world economy unless it really is the ONLY currency in the world.  Otherwise, you have to divide that value up amongst competing currencies by a proportionate percentage.  Really, Hal's valuation is bogus because it could never be the ONLY currency in the world; there are too many things that could and would compete, that's the nature of economies.  As it is NOW, the inherent value derived from its utility is no more than any other currency, like the the euro or the dollar.  Sending across a wire isn't exactly new or groundbreaking. 
I know bitcoin was made for speculating, saving, spending, and anything else done with money.  But as I said before, I believe 95+% of its *current* use is speculation only.  Not "saving" (isn't that just another word for speculating?) or spending.  Yeah you might buy a cup of coffee or give a tip with it, but despite being made for spending AND saving, it's only mainly being used for speculating.    
A billion dollar share of a 300 trillion dollar world?   There's a long way to go from *that* to "dominant payment system throughout the world".  I'll grant that it does have some inherent value derived from it's utility as a unique currency, but I definitely don't see it ever EVER reaching 10 million a coin because I don't see it ever becoming the only currency on earth.  
As an aside, if it ever actually did reach $10 million a coin, wouldn't that pretty much max out it's divisibility?  I mean .00000001 would be worth a dime, and you can't go any further than that.  If we're going to value the entire world's economy with it, we might want to look into using more than 8 decimal places.   
@_date: 2013-03-23 18:16:30
Well sure, it's great if you've already got your coins stuffed under the mattress.  But as soon as the government steps in and starts regulating the exchanges, all *future* sales becomes subject to non-anonymity and a central authority, and those coins you have stuffed under your mattress will lose value.  They're not stored on an exchange, but to spend them....    you need an exchange.  Nobody can take them away from you, but they *can* be made worthless and/or unusable.  
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:47:54
In other words, Bitcoiners are NOT people.  They are a race of mutants, not subject to fallibility. That's right,  BITCOINERS ARE INFALLIBLE.  Man, who knew!!??
All these mere humans keep trying to convince me that my 401k, my bank accounts, my gold &amp; silver, my IRAs and my real estate -- they keep trying to tell me those things are real but bitcoiners can (apprently) demonstrate that they're NOT.  I believe they ARE real, but (apparently) I'm wrong.  All of those things are (apparently) "demonstrably false".  So sad, I'm wasting my life.  And I'm an academic to boot!  Realizing that my net worth is just me intellectually conforming...  man that IS  bad career move (I'm a software developer).  Priceless! 
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:11:05
Stable compared to BITCOIN, dummy.  
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:09:54
Stability is kind of important when it comes to being a store value.  If you're trying to say that bitcoin is a better store of value than the dollar is, you're also trying to say that bitcoin is more stable than the dollar is.  
Here's part b of that definition -- you seemed to have missed it: 


@_date: 2013-03-31 04:10:45


And bitcoins are nothing like that. Yes, gold and silver can be traded with bitcoins, but they can be traded with dollars or pesos or pounds or whatever just as easily.  It's just another form of fiat currency, not a government-backed promise to deliver physical gold &amp; silver.  So what if you can buy gold &amp; silver with it - that doesn't make it anything like a gold &amp; silver certificate.
I like your speculative view of it, hoping for a market price that competes with gold -- kind of proves my theory that that's all this market is made of -- speculators hoping for a cashout.  Don't get me wrong, I'm speculating too -- I'll cash out my btc when the price is right.  Who knows, I might actually use it as an everyday currency someday, but not while there are gains like this to be had.  Why would anybody spend a dollar that might be worth 2 dollars next week?  And why would anybody put their hard earned paychecks into a spending account when it might halve next week? Nope, not gonna work as a currency.  Worth a gamble for sure though; I hope you're right, I'd love a payday, no doubt about it.  That's why I'm here.  
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:10:54
I've spent the better part of today arguing about why bitcoin isn't a good store of value.  I know this is less about the fundamentals behind that and more specific to an individual user -- but still, this is yet another reason why I personally won't be storing any of my wealth in BTC.  You have to have a fucking engineering degree to secure the coins and even then you might get burned.  No. Thanks.  
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:15:10
It would be kick ass if everybody who "doesn't get it" could make 70 million dollars.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:23:19
If you have to sit on your coins to avoid actualizing a loss,  thus rendering your money illiquid, you don't have to call it a loss, but you sure the hell can't call it profit either.  Hell you can't even call it a liquid asset -- it's something you're holding on your books to avoid taking a loss.  You're are right though - it's definitely not a loss.  Yet.

You're assuming that they'll always be worth something.


Like... [now??](
I don't know, I guess time will tell...  but I'm not putting any real money into BTC.  I'll throw a little speculative cash at it quikpik style, but I think the government sniffing around could have a devastating psychological effect on the bitcoin market.  In my eyes, it's a very fragile currency because it's so young.  The bells &amp; whistles that make it so attractive had better perform as advertised *through government scrutiny and intervention*, or it's not going to work.  The thing about it is, it's all psychological.  It's heavily dependent on trust and faith, and bitcoin still has a lot to prove.  If it does emerge as the next major currency, it's going to be a bumpy ride.

@_date: 2013-12-30 20:12:03
Yeah.... that's a very slow, gradual process.  It's taken decades for the purchasing power of the dollar to erode.  Bitcoin has lost up to HALF of it's purchasing power overnight, more than once.  Pretty simple to follow that logic and see why USD is more stable (and therefore a better store of value) than bitcoin.

If you bought that $20/BTC at $1200, I guarantee you would NOT be saying bitcoin is doing a superb job of storing value -- "BETTER than any other currency"  my ass.  When's the last time the USD lost 50% in one day?  
LOL "My $20/BTC fell to $10/BTC overnight, but it's doing a superb job of storing value, better than everything else" LOL 
Imagine this:  You bought 50BTC on Dec 3rd at $1,200....  for a total of $60k.  TODAY, those bitcoins are worth $40k.  You've lost $15k in value between then and now.  
How the hell is THAT superb, better than everything else???? If you really wanted a "stable store of value" you'd have been better off just leaving it in USD because....   you know... it'd still be worth $65k.

Nice, you're finally starting to sound rational.  I totally agree with you, Chief Bitcoin IS a giant idiot.  It could work out for him, but so could going to Vegas and putting his whole paycheck on black.  As I said before, I'll gamble with my gambling money but my paycheck will remain in the good old, stable USD - I won't be buying any risky assets unless the fundamentals call for it.

Well that's the textbook definition.  That's definitely not how I think of intrinsic value.  I think, in the real world, the idea of intrinsic value is based more on actual utility or benefit to life.  Something you can use, or do something with, or consume.  We can draw it up on paper as much as we want - but in real life, there *are* things with an absolute, autonomous, unimputable value.  
I think at the very least, things that are tangible have more inherent value than things that are intangible.

@_date: 2013-12-30 18:06:16
ANY time horizon should make sense.  It shouldn't matter if I pick &amp; choose dates or not -- stable is stable.  If I can pick dates where your value was HALVED in any period where you were holding it, it proves that it's NOT a stable store of value.  Can you pick &amp; choose dates where my purchasing power in USD was halved?  Go ahead, try it.  I dare you. 
edit:  nevermind, don't try it.  I already know the answer. :)
