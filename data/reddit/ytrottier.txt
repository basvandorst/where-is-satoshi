I can explain the thought process that almost got me to mine at ghash.io.
I started seriously learning about bitcoin around January. The first thing a newbie like me is likely to come across is a bunch of old articles exhorting you to mine your own bitcoin, so I initially wanted to take that advice. Researching this was very confusing. There was a suite of new terms, and the technology has changed so fast from CPU to GPU to ASIC that it was easy to be fooled by an old article reblogged under a different date. When I found out about cloud-mining with CEX.IO, that seemed to be the easy solution.
At the same time, I have to admit I was still influenced by conventions from banking. I was looking for a safe way to earn some interest on bitcoin savings deposits. Not having that option seemed like a disadvantage versus fiat savings. By March, with bitcoin value going down, cloud-mining seemed to me like the bitcoin equivalent of a savings account.
Then I took one extra step that people usually skip: I ran my own numbers. This always seems to be the key difference that differentiates me from the consensus decision. I was likely to lose money by cloud-mining, or at least didn't have enough probability of success to make it worthwhile.
So I never did mine or cloudmine, but I came pretty close. Does that thought process help?

One way to examine the problem further is that it's not really the number of buyers and sellers that moves the price, it's their relative price-sensitivity.
Example 1: people tend to buy medication without considering price in the decision, while drug-makers look at a business case before adding another shift. So the price rises until it starts to challenge patient's ability to pay, and they become price-responsive. An improvement in the economy would initially increase the number of buyers, and then the price rises and the supply increases, but eventually equilibrium would probably happen at a higher price with the same ratio of buyers to sellers as you had before. 
Example 2: In deregulated electricity markets, power plants tend to sell at any price and consumers tend to buy at any price. Power plants do that because they have low incremental costs: the infrastructure and employees still have to be paid regardless of whether the plant is on or off. This is especially true of nuclear, renewables, hydro, and geothermal, the carbon-free sources. Consumers are largely unaware of the current spot price, and even when they are, it is too complex to incorporate it in their decision making. Now look at deregulation in California and Ontario, where there is a high-penetration of carbon-free price-insensitive generators. Deregulation caused extreme volatility, bouncing from negative prices that motivated generators to shutdown, to blackouts when supply could not meet demand.
Got it? Now we apply this to bitcoin. I would say that the new corporate bitcoin sellers are not sensitive to price. They're stores who only treat this as a payment mechanism, and they want to sell it right away for whatever they can get at the current price. The new corporate bitcoin buyers are very sensitive to price, because they're investors who are in the habit of searching for the best deal. So this new crop of buyers and sellers have tendencies that trend against the unbridled enthusiasm of early adopters, and that dampens volatility and price gain.
Now watch me get proven wrong by next week's price explosion.

Here's my own calculation, done independently before seeing CricketPinata's. I'll comment on his calc's separately.
1.21 gigawatts is a decent easy-to-remember estimate for the output of a nuclear power plant. Actual numbers vary widely from 0.3 to 5 gigawatts, mostly depending on the number of reactors in the plant.
Based on the million dollar electric bill, I would guess this facility uses around 10 megawatts. (0.01 gigawatts). The entire bitcoin network consumes about 100 megawatts according to a Coindesk calculation, so 5% of that would be about 5 megawatts. We're generally in the ballpark of 1% of a nuclear power plant to run this Chinese mine.
Not much you can tell from the cables without knowing the voltage, but my rough sense would be that they're too small for that kind of power. But maybe with a bunch of cables in parallel, one set for each warehouse, it starts to make sense.

How do you request a payment without exposing a public key? Even if you had a secure way to send the public key to the payer, wouldn't that mean that he could reverse the transaction right after paying you?
Doesn't confirmation publish the receiving wallet's public key on the blockchain? What prevents third parties from grabbing the money?

Anybody know the fee schedule? I used the one in Square One last night. I can confirm there was no option to sell bitcoin, only buy. I put in a $5 bill, and received $4.39 worth of bitcoin in my wallet. The bitcoin transaction fee was Ƀ0.0002 ($0.13),  the buy/sell spread would account for maybe $0.05, so I presume Virtex made $0.43 from the deal, or about 10%.
Edit: on second thought, I'm guessing Virtex just took 10% after deducting the mining fee: ($5.00-$0.13)*90%=$4.38

China artificially fixes the exchange rate low to keep their exports high. Obviously that requires them to keep printing yen, causing rapid inflation. To constrain the amount of yen they have to print, they do not allow people to exchange money freely. You have to give the bank a reason as to why you are buying and selling yen, (like tourist travel for example,) the amount has to be reasonable, and larger or frequent amounts are routinely refused with no reason given.
The end result is that many companies, Chinese and Western alike, have significant accounts stranded in yen that is bound to lose value through inflation. Bitcoin offers a potential escape route.

You underestimate many of the difficulties involved. The biggest one is how do you price grid reliability? We have seen over and over again that when electricity markets are fully deregulated and rely only on spot price, what follows is massive volatility in price and massive power outages, followed by panicked re-regulation.
In order for markets to work efficiently, both supply and demand need to be price-responsive. The problem is that electricity demand is not. People want to be able to turn on the light switch or the stove at any time without checking the current price. Also, most carbon-free supplies are not price-responsive either: solar, wind, run-of-the-river hydro, and nuclear all have to use it or lose it when energy is available.
It might work when we have more storage technologies or more responsive appliances: electric car chargers that automatically try to get a good deal, refrigerators that stock up on ice when electricity is cheap and go dark when it is expensive. But there is much physical hardware to develop before the protocol becomes an issue.

OK, so the technological pieces are starting to make sense. With the fuel cell technology you describe, we could have a sizeable amount of storage that can respond to spot price signals in both directions, stabilize the grid, and reduce the importance of long-distance connections. Your storage points could have those precise clocks and communication to act as the pacemakers for frequency/phase. With high amounts of electric cars and thermal storage, we could have price-responsive downstream demand. But there's still an important piece of the puzzle needed for an efficient market: price-responsive upstream supply.
If you don't have that, then careful accounting will show that your fuel cells are really the only money-making part of the operation. Better to stop maintaining your solar cells or not build them at all, and invest the savings in growing your storage capacity. Soak up your neighbour's electricity for free on windy days when there's a surplus, and then sell into the shortage during windless nights. A pure spot market offers no incentive for generator maintenance and construction, and your system degrades into blackouts when you run out of suckers.
A spot market needs some amount of upstream price-responsive production to anchor the prices. The options for this are: fossil fuels, biofuels, or reservoir hydroelectric. As long as you have enough of these to hold up the price, and you have the futuristic fuel cells and demand response technologies we discussed, then yes, a decentralized free market on electricity would work. So this is the framework that your bitcoin protocol would have to be designed for.
Otherwise you need some way to incentivize the maintenance of static infrastructure that cannot respond to price on an hourly timescale. This is currently done by various forms of regulated pricing, controlled by the government.
@_date: 2014-07-07 22:45:07
I'm sorry, but the grid just doesn't work like that. You can't just have everyone be one cell in the network. There's frequency and phase matching to consider. There's minimum and maximum voltages. There's voltage drop across lines and maximum current capacities. And yes, if you plant generators anywhere willy-nilly, you can create situations where power would stop flowing (generators would have to be dispatched) because the voltage gradient goes the wrong way.
Home-grown power production actually increases the need for "big copper" because it is usually wind or solar, which rise and fall over hundreds of km simultaneously. So when the wind dies, your wind-based community now has to import electricity from hundreds or even thousands of km away.
Water reservoirs are great if you have the topology for it. You don't even need to pump it as you suggest, just throttle the gate on your generator in response to spot price. But most regions of the world don't have the topology for any significant reservoir. And no battery to date has anything close to the economics needed to compete with demand-response technologies.
Look, I worked in this industry for 10 years, and spend a lot of my free time trying to look to solutions to the carbon problem. I'm glad to see that you want to help, but you're going to need to educate yourself more if you're serious. I'm just trying to give you some pointers.

There are a few problems with that:
1) You also have to update the amount each time you spend some. If there isn't enough money in your wallet to cover the transaction, what would happen to it?
2) This scheme also assumes that all your heirs are maintaining a bitcoin wallet. If you give your private key, your heirs can put off learning about bitcoin until you pass on.
3) What if you and your wife die at the same time in a car accident? Your two transactions automatically deposit into each other's account, and your kids get nothing. Private keys in the will allow more flexibility for real life complexity that programmers like to ignore.

What happens if a rogue miner includes a double spend in a block, but only reveals one of them at a time? In the existing system, that block would be rejected as invalid.

kilowatt/hr is not a real unit. You are likely trying to use killowatt•hr, which is a unit of energy.
A nuclear power plant puts out about 12 billion kW•hr PER YEAR. That works out to 1.37 GW, roughly the same as my 1.21 GW approximation mentioned in response to todu.
So this 13 MW operation consumes about 1% of a nuclear plant's 1.3 GW output. Using your estimate of 250 MW for the entire network, that means it would take 20% of the output of a nuclear power plant to run the entire Bitcoin network.

What we need is not cap and trade, it's carbon fee and dividend, as advocated by the Citizens' Climate Lobby. Tax fossil fuels at the wellhead for every ton of CO2 that they will ultimately produce, and then return the money equitably as a dividend to all citizens.
This would be far easier to administer and cheaper to enforce than cap and trade. Economic studies show that the less wealthy 60% of the US population would wind up with more money, while having a strong market incentive to use that money to reduce their emissions. Other studies show that a fee and dividend system would help grow the economy.

Making an appliance price-aware is relatively easy, but on it's own it's about as useful as adding a clock to it. The problem is making it price-responsive. Turning on and off with a price threshold is not nearly good enough. Refrigerators need extra refrigeration circuits and valves and a tank to stock up ice for the long peak periods when it conserves power. Car chargers need some prediction of how many km will be driven tomorrow and make sure the battery has at least that much charge.
Your mention of "automatic routing" seems even more optimistic. The electric grid is not an older version of the internet. It's a completely different thing, where electricity losses grow with distance, electricity cannot flow uphill against a voltage gradient, and switches are much more expensive pieces of capital equipment that we can't afford to upgrade to the latest fashion every few years. The physical world of big steel and big copper is very resistant to the "disruption" that gets virtual people so excited. 
Distributed energy storage would be nice. It would solve most of the problems I'm pointing out. But that's not an easy problem to solve.

When I was explaining the world wide web to my parents and their generation in the 1990's, it was really hard for them to understand that servers could be anywhere in the world. That with one click of the mouse, you could go from the Smithsonian to the Louvre. It was common for my mother to become frightened of the sudden "travel" and unplug her computer in a panic.
My father was convinced that if he could read documents in other people's computers than other people must be able to read his documents on his computer. Come to think of it, with what we now know about the NSA, maybe he was smarter than I was.
Women in chat rooms used their real names or otherwise declared their gender, and quickly faced sexual harassment. But being new to the whole thing, many panicked and did not realize the experience could be shut down simply by closing a window. A friend of mine, very intelligent but very new to computers, was seriously traumatized when her character was raped in a text-only multi-user dungeon.

Any McGyvers here? I am thinking of building long-term cold storage with available equipment:
1) An old beat-up MacBook Air OSX 10.6 with broken wifi, no ethernet, dead screen, but a working external monitor.
2) Remote access to a 3yr old Windows 7 laptop. (Cannot be operated offline.)
The Macbook cannot be upgraded to OSX 10.7, and therefore cannot run Electrum or Armory. But it can run Multibit. Multibit can generate keys, but it cannot sign transactions offline. Wallet backup can be made by USB stick.
A few years in the future, I will have a better offline machine that could run Armory or whatever is the latest trend. Is it reasonable to hope that it would be able to import my Multibit wallet and sign transactions offline at that point? From my experiments, Armory and Electrum seem unable to import Multibit wallets today. Am I doing it wrong? I think the worst case scenario is just that I might have to import into an online Multibit in order to retrieve the coins; is my reasoning correct or is there some reason why my coins might be stranded?
Finally, I'd like an easy way to watch that wallet in Canadian dollars, just for peace of mind. I know that I could watch on blockchain.info, but I'd like to have something that also gets the Canadian exchange rate and converts. I can do this with bitWallet on iOS, but I'd like to do it on the remote Windows machine. Trouble is, Armory and Electrum only seem to be able to watch wallets created by their own, and Multibit doesn't seem to allow a watch only wallet. Any suggestions?

If a mining pool were to control a majority of the hashing power, then they would have the capability to perform a "51% attack" with reasonably high odds of success. A "51% attack" actually covers a range of possible attacks, most of which are feasible at any percentage; success just becomes more probable the more hashing power you have. A "successful" attack would generally be short-lived, but devastating to bitcoin's reputation. The greatest victim would be the mining pool involved, so they have no obvious motivation to carry out such an attack. But one could imagine some kind of secret and nefarious government control of the hashing pool, seeking to undermine bitcoin. With so much money at stake, many people would prefer to minimize any risks to an extreme degree. But don't lose sleep over this.

Matching with an inverter is trivial so long as you have very few of them. You have a big nuclear plant or coal plant acting as pacemaker, and it can accept the noise from a handful of inverters selling power back to the grid. But that solution doesn't scale. The worst case scenario happens when trying to recover from a blackout, where not only do you need to start everyone in sync, but you need to maintain stability as big pieces of load and supply are reconnected suddenly.
Yes, more communication capabilities with precise clocks can overcome this. That's essentially how the big generators do it.
Good, cheap, energy storage would solve nearly everything and might make a decentralized grid a tractable problem. I don't think that's going to happen with utility batteries. Price-responsive charging of electric vehicles would help if they become popular. Then thermal energy storage would be the most cost-efficient step. Then there's flywheels, like the ones from Temporal Power, and compressed air. Either of those last two can act alternately as price-responsive demand and price-responsive supply.
But even with storage and price-responsive demand, we are losing upstream price-responsive supply as we move to carbon-free sources. What is your solar panel going to do when it's sunny but the price is too low for its taste? Withholding power might help raise the price for your neighbours, but it doesn't reduce wear and tear on your solar panel. So you sell at any price. Nuclear reactors do the same thing, and so does run-of-the-river hydro. With enough deregulated generators doing the same thing, the price of electricity goes to zero, or even negative. Consumers are happy, until producers stop maintaining their equipment and the place is seized with rolling blackouts.
This is what happened in California in 2000. This is what happened in Ontario in 2003. Electricity is not a real commodity. It's only billed by the kWh to establish your share of a fairly static infrastructure.

I tried to pick well-known examples with extremes of stiff and loose need. Note that my second example is about electricity, not fuel, which is wasted or even breaks things if not used in time. And it turns out that humans do not have an inexhaustible need for electricity. We refuse to increase our consumption at nights and on the weekends, even if the price goes negative and producers are willing to pay consumers to keep burning it. Where is your framework of human need here?
But another way to look at it is that both examples did include currency in the transaction. Medicine for money, and electricity for money. But since we can't eat money and it has negligible heating value, I guess no one would ever accept money in exchange for something real like medicine or electricity. Maybe that was the problem with electricity deregulation, what we really need is a market where you can exchange electricity for sheep directly. But I think my fundamental point about price-responsiveness would still apply.
If you want to bet on bitcoin futures, there many places where you can do that, such as

Cooling doesn't add that much if done right. 4kW of miners produce 4kW of heat. That could be removed by a high efficiency 1kW air conditioner, even in a home operation that has to be kept at room temperature on a hot summer day. But whenever the miners are allowed to run hotter, or when the air temperature is lower, the heat pump efficiency goes higher. In fact, miners can run hotter than the air temperature on a hot day, which means all you really need in an industrial facility is fans, not air conditioners, and your cooling power becomes negligible.

Car parking payment system.
Advantages to lot operator: no payment hardware necessary, no credit card fees, reduced robbery risk for cash.
Advantages to driver: refill payment remotely, bitcoin enthusiasm factor, pay by the minute
The most commonly discussed approach is to put a different QR code (or other identifier) in front of each parking space. If the address has received sufficient recent payment, then any car is free to park there. The trouble with that is first, you need to pay for a weatherproof tamper-resistant sign for each stall. An attacker could overlay or replace a cheap sign with a sticker with their own QR code, or possibly just move signs around. The attendant who writes the infraction tickets can check that the sign is not tampered, but the parking company still has to accept the occasional losses and work to deter the attacker.
My idea would be to embed your license plate OR stall number as a public note right on the blockchain with your payment and timestamp. Then you just need a single weatherproof sign for the destination address, and it can be high up to hinder access and/or monitored by a surveillance camera.
Drivers wouldn't need to install any special app or go to a website, so long as they have a wallet that can embed notes. And yet there would be money to be made selling software to the parking lot operators to easily monitor which stalls or license plates are paid up or about to expire. With an app, the driver could track time remaining accurately &amp; remotely, and receive messages like “you left your lights on”.
