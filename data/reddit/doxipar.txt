Gemini covers the withdraw fee. I can send money from gemini to my wallet without paying a dime. (Up to 30 times per month.) While it's important to implement these things, Gemini is doing the right thing by covering the costs of their choices.

I keep as little in the bank as possible. Basically just what is needed to pay bills. Banks use your money to fuck us all over. There has never been a fiat currency in the history of this entire planet that didn't end up worthless. Anything not locked to a finite resource (Gold/Silver/Blockchain) will fall. 
Look at what happened to Greece. They weren't allowed to withdraw more than $150 a day when their economy tanked. Banks used their citizens' money to payback their own mistakes. 
We can agree to disagree, but if you can use real money (not currency) to buy goods and services, you're making smart choices.
(Also seriously, I've never held up a line, they just scan my phone, takes less time than swiping a card and using the terminal)

Here's a few good reasons:
* Don't have a Credit Card/Debit Card/Bank Account.
* Don't have cash.
* Want to support gyft for allowing ease of access to bitcoin in retail environments.
* Want to say fuck off to coinbase taking a fee for turning bitcoins into fiat.
* Want to get rewards from using their bitcoins in retail environments. (I have spent $100 at whole foods and have $3 off my next gift card)

Gyft is fully aware that this is possible, and has publicly recommended that people do this. If anything, ebay caught on and told Gyft to knock it off. Which would make sense, given their relationship with paypal. Gotta get them paypal fees.
Can you just buy many $25 gift cards?
