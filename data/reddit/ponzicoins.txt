How many more years before you all admit there is no killer app?  It's been 6 years, and bitcoin is insignificant in all respects.  The VC put into it is worth more than bitcoin itself, which speaks volumes.  None of it materialized, and there's WELL under 1 million users world-wide.
In 6 years HTTP had thousands of killer apps including Amazon, eBay, and Hotmail.  It also had 71 million users.

Sure thing champ, bitcoin VC increased in dollar amounts because of 2 big investments.  In actual raw number of investments, the number shrunk in half.  Bitcoin transnational volume USD has remained unchanged for 15 months which indicates a complete stagnation of new users.  All traffic to bitcoin related websites is down, often times drastically over the last 15 months.  Bitcoin is 100% stagnant and losing ground in all respects.  But hey, the number of spam transactions is increasing every day, so you have that going which is nice.

I'll just point to Wordpress having 2 bitcoin sales per week for all the proof I need to support my opinion that bitcoin is a failure.  Overstock has dwindling sales that drastically undercut estimations.  Firefox projected losses of $144,000 in 23 days if they accepted bitcoin.  Whollyhemp noted 8% loss by accepting bitcoin.  Countless merchants come to this sub to complain about never having sales.  Users of this sub come here to complain a merchant they tried to use does not in fact accept bitcoin.  Retail sales are absolutely not happening.  And if retail sales are not happening, bitcoin has no meaningful economy that will last.  
[Oh and speaking of transaction fees...lol.](  The amount of USD or BTC a miner earns through transaction fees make up less than .05% of a miners revenue.  Yes, miners are now being paid using 99.5% subsidy which is exponentially decreasing every 4 years.  Transaction fees are demonstrably not increasing over time.  Once the subsidy ends, the network ends.

You deposit $50 worth of USD into your account and when the time is right you can send someone $50 equivalent value of BTC at any time, instantly.  If the price of bitcoin goes to $0 you still have $50, if the price goes to $500 you still have $50.  It's basically so when you're ready to make your next drug purchase off Silk Road you don't have to wait for ACH deposits.
