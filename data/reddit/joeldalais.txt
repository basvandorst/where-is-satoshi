Colored Coins;
You define a certain amount of bitcoin to be used (e.g 2 bitcoin/100 million satoshi).
Only a minimum of can be used as a 'token' (5461 (roughly, can't remember exactly off top of my head), this is due to technical reasons and can/will be changed in the future (assuming bitcoin growth in value).
These are then 'painted' (marked) to signify whatever you categorized them as.
As you said, it is still satoshi/bitcoin, and still operates on the bitcoin block chain.

Well, that's the US and I'm from the UK, its different here. And no, there is no obligation here to report digital currency transactions, only when you convert digital/crypto to fiat.
And if a LE was trying to blame an individual on the location of a last address, or an associated address and had zero proof that you ever had any ownership of an address in a chain leading to that address then they do not have enough proof to state that you own the coins in the last address.
And in noway does moving coins from 1 address to another amount to 'tax evasion' and 'money laundering', that's just ridiculous.

The laws of fiat are based upon the blind faith humans are supposed to have in the issuers (banks). And these institutes act on the word of God (hence "In God We Trust"). Paper money was created in an age when the printing press dawned and people were much more superstitious.
People believed that the Monarchy was chosen by God and 'created' separately to be superior and carried the word of God, and so if they (the monarchy's, and banks by extension) said money is money because they said it was, then it was. 
Hence - Fiat.
The laws of Bitcoin are based upon the laws of the multiverse (or universe, depending what you believe/study), for 2+2 will always be 4. If you were a God fearing person, and as such believed that God made the universe (whichever God, you choose). Then logically Bitcoin is far superious (for ethical and religious reasons) than cotton with numbers printed on.
Fiat was created. Bitcoin IS the numbers. Its always been, like how fire has always been, we've just learned how to harness it.

p.s. the "51% attack amagad", a lot of it was hype generated by people hoping to cause panic/force prices lower and make money off panicked people. It happens again and again and again.. and similar things will happen.
As you learn more about Bitcoin you'll realise how extremely unlikely a "51% attack" is, and also how useless it is (it would cause some effect, but it wouldn't 'destroy' bitcoin or anything like that).

Every wallet provider (blockchain, multi-bit, etc), is growing, every exchange is growing (some slower than others). And these are not even the publicly available numbers (such as github).
Where are you **not** seeing growth?


Then with your logic I am the only 1 out of all the (millions of) Bitcoiners that believe in a free market and that competition is good.
Let me just correct you there and pop your bubble. I am **not** the only one who believes in a free market and that competition is good.
That was kinda like the whole point of introducing a **competitive currency such as bitcoin** onto the market in such a way that would enable it to be **freely chosen by its users and that can not be regulated by any state** (aka, a definition of a free market).
And as a note, Bitcoin is not the important thing, it is just the application of the first usage of Blockchain tech. There are many other applications incoming.

Ye, I strongly agree with you that UK banks are pain. We've went through around 20 banks last summer to get a business account, no luck.
Hence why we're happy with okpays model and our alternative (royal mail) funding. We have multiple ways of depositing/withdrawals, opening access to the unbanked and banked alike, whilst still operating with no bank account :)
And yes, IBWT definitely needs more time to grow and attract traders, getting there, but its going to be a little while yet.
Also, though I have my own personal thoughts about banks and the banking empire, IBWT will be getting a UK business account as soon as banks here become friendly towards bitcoin businesses. The faster payment system would make a UK exchange superior to any other exchange (if the exchange can get a UK bank account).

Not a full house, but more than was present would have been better.
More present shows interest, and seeing as most MP's are ignorant on money creation &amp; supply one would hope that they would be more interested.
Especially because of the state of the economy.. For example, when they were debating MP pay rises it was more than a full house, MP's standing all over the place because all the seats were taken.
So, no, I don't expect a full house on absolutely every debate. But I did expect a better turnout for such an important topic that has not been discussed for 170 years.

see, now, you have a good point sir.
however, how many average 'bitcoiners' (average meaning, those who do not watch most of the charts/stats/days destroyed, etc), would observe the amount of days destroyed.
clearly yourself would (observe such things), but such a sale wouldn't effect the market price, which is what would primarily cause a 'panic'. It would be interesting to note (the days destroyed), but I put forward that 3,500 coins being sold would not cause a panic (regardless of days destroyed), but it would definitely be interesting to note.
And I also put forward that Satoshi wouldn't sell (a few) 1000's of coins at a time, in the wisdom that little is better.

Hi, just to confirm that was me posting.
I've requested clarification from OKPAY, I will let you know.
As (a slightly more expensive) alternative, any registered customers at OKPAY (without verification) can deposit Bitcoins or Litecoins to receive fiat and change it to the denomination of their choice. And then you can deposit to [IBWT]( via your (only registered) OKPAY account (you wouldn't need verification on IBWT for this either, just a registered account).
Though this method is only useful for day traders. If as you say still carries weight, then I'm afraid US customers lose out, unfortunately.

I totally agree it won't become obsolete that easy. And I personally think there will be 'traditional' banks that have adopted new ways far into the future.
My point is that, adoption of a technological advancement that clearly (for those that have done the appropriate research) has potential and current use over the current system used (e.g. horses &gt; cars, snail mail &gt; email, etc), will be adopted, regardless.
It's human nature.
@_date: 2014-07-27 13:24:40
urm... you have it backwards, try again
p.s. I put all my excess wealth into Bitcoin
p.p.s. if you take out massive loans just before hyperinflation hits, e.g. $100,000, then hyperinflation hits, then your interest rates on your loan go up 200+ p/c, and the amount you have to payback is something ridiculous like $200,000 (because prices everywhere have increased and the loan company you used must raise its interests to coincide with hyperinflation and their own costs).
Yay, well done for taking out a loan right before hyperinflation hits.
But hey .. if you think that taking out $100,000 and having to pay back twice the amount 6 (or sooner) months later is a *good* move, then more power to you.
Also .. you know that over time people have had to pay higher and higher mortgages right? And that house prices have gone up .. this is pretty clear yes? This is what is known as 1 of the many effects of inflation.
Here's a fun excersize for you if you can be bothered to learn more about inflation,

They think its hard to integrate as a payment.
I mean seriously though .. it is not that hard to hit copy/paste and sticking a qr code &amp; (long) address on a new page or integrated into a current platform. If you find copy/paste difficult to do, then ye, ok, I imagine you would find it difficult to integrate.
Bitcoin is so freakin easy to integrate for an eCommerce site or for a physical store. I have integrated both and advised on integration in both aspects, and it is VERY easy, and fairly simple even for the non-technical minded (assuming they can be taught what copy/paste or ctrl+c/ctrl+v is).


Yes and no. It is inflationary as you state, until the last coin is mined. Yet it carries deflationary qualities as it is finite and lost coins do get replaced (supply deflation). Once the last coin is mined, then its full on deflationary.

you would have to secretly build them all, keeping up with the hash rate, so constantly pumping in more and more escalating money, and then eventually, when you were sure you had 51% (or over) you would have to pray that you do, because if you came online with 50% people would notice and you'd find emergency forks and more reserve hardware suddenly coming into the system.
So, we're talking a hell of a lot of money there, for a situation that you only have  a 1 shot chance at, and if you fail, then you blow all that money (whilst contributing to an already self destructive inflationary system).
And if it succeeded, wow, you get to reverse your own transaction, maybe double spend. So you'd need the amount of Bitcoin to make the cost of doing it even worth it.
Then also, if it succeeded, you'd only temporarily destroy the value of Bitcoin, there are altcoins, people would hedge, and they would definitely buy low again, yet likely much more people this time, it would rise much faster. And the coins gained by any double spend, would it equal the cost of setting it all up?

Relative to its previous 6 months its used a lot more (this recent month). What will be interesting (and hopefully others will check also), is whether this trend will continue.

I'm not even going to try to explain the difference between **pre-mining** and **continuous mining.**
You might aswell restate the OP as **"anyone who mined from 2009, and anyone post 2009 that has over 20,000-30,000+ coins, whether brought or mined".**
And on that blog he actually states 


So ... even getting your information from there you state 


Maths is not your strong point is it?
(Sergio makes a guess, you state a fact, I won't bother trying to explain the difference, lets just leave it at 'there is a difference between a guess and a statement', whether you believe that or not is your own problem).
I can see now that I lack the skills required to explain why your post is wrong and why you are wrong. It's not your fault, I blame myself.
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:10:35


That is a fair point, and I concede that you are probably right (huh, shock horror, I admitted I was wrong! Big surprise ;).


Because, like I said, you obviously have no clue, because you can't even explain any of them, yet you're talking like you understand these things, you're so clever ;)
Your response was the typical "I have no idea and this person just called me out" response  - "I'm not gonna explain to you because (insertrandomreasonhere)" - (hint, its because you don't know what you're talking about).
And the downvotes are from the yourself and shibes on multiple accounts ;) Oh dear, you think people don't notice? durr.


You've proven yourself unable to backup any of the arguments that you put forward (apart from the adoption rate).
And that you've contradicted yourself and make yourself look hypocritical and rather moronic to be quite honest.
I've continued posting/replying so the record is here. Like the people from 3-4 years ago ("Bitcoin will die at $5! it will never pass $3 again, its so useless!!").
And so people can see what you've written and how everything you've said has been argued against and proven false (again, apart from the adoption rate, which I concede that twitter/facebook quite probably had a faster adoption rate of businesses).

If you're here saying this "CC is cheaper than bitcoin". Then.. wow .. just wow .... how willfully ignorant people can be still astonishes me from time to time.
OK, just to point out. Getting a CC payment system costs money to setup and you have to jump through hoops to get it, which costs money again (unless you do it yourself). Even so, not only is there the % fee (which IS higher than 1p, or less, depending on your bitcoin transaction fee), there is only monthly/annual fees (with using CC).
AND then there is the loss from bad credit (chargebacks). That ALONE far surpasses any crappy CC (but, you do need the viable amount of trade in crypto to make this part worth it, but it will be in time to come).


It is currently inflationary, yes, but it will be deflationary. And if you think that all 3600 BTC mined every day are sold every day, you would be mistaken. Most miners take a while to earn 1 BTC.

There's lots of paper wallet providers out there (personally I use our own (ibwt.co.uk), because I know I can trust it 100%), but there are definitely plenty of others that I would likely trust if I ever had to use them (google 'bitcoin paper wallet'). And please make sure you do suitable research/due diligence before using a paper wallet. If lost and not backed up in any way or form then its lost for good.
Advice - multiple paper wallets and only store a minimum on each.
A usb stick, floppy drive, cd's, an offline computer that you will never ever ever connect to the internet.
A couple of useful notes - have a 'spending wallet', that you only ever refill as needed, and only from 1 of your multiple paper wallets (or usd/cd/etc) at a time.
And having a 'honeypot' as a pre-warning device (store crumbs on a wallet on your computer with a weaker password, 10 chars or something).
If your honeypot gets taken then you know to shut everything down and sort your system(s) out.

Every nation in the world is also split up, and in most countries they also have regional banks. It is the same the world over.
If the Bitcoin Foundation was to remain as 1 single entity, then it would be rather centralised and opposed to the philosophy behind Bitcoin (that of decentralization).
Perhaps there is a better way than having a Foundation in each country to represent the best interests of Bitcoin in that locality, hopefully someone will come forward with that great idea one day. But for now, personally, I think a Foundation in each country is better than 1 single US Foundation.
The world is bigger than just the US ...

Because its pseudonymous already.
Explanation: As an individual you can constantly create new addresses which are not tied to any identifying factor whatsoever. Once you buy from an exchange, an individual, or anywhere, that has an identity attached, you can send your own money to as many of your own addresses as you wish and you can claim deniability on each one = anonymous.
And that's not even counting the mixers out there.
For big business, banks and governments, its a different story. But hey, big business is FAR more taxes for government than the individuals combined.

Good reply.
Next question.
Do you think wages have gone up relative to interest rates? (especially true interest, e.g. price of bread, milk, water, energy, etc).
If your answer is **yes**, then sure, everyone's going to start getting paid $100's per hour and the average wage already is $50 per hour (in the US) (and you are probably a executive banker, as they are the only ones who's rate of pay is also defined by inflation), amongst other things.
If your answer is **no**, that wages have remained 'remarkably' static (the same) over the last few decades, only increases by petty %'s whilst the cost of living has increased substantially more (in line with inflation, as producers need to meet costs y'know).
If your answer is yes and you think wages coincide with inflation and will coincide with hyperinflation (and the current avg wage in the US is $50 p/h).. then "ok then", we don't have anymore to discuss and we might very well be living on different planets, or you're a banker, or you just simply have no idea on the average wage over the last few decades.
If your answer is no (that the average wage has not increased substantially to coincide with inflation). Then why do you think wages will suddenly increase with hyperinflation when they never did with inflation?
Honestly curious .. 




Landlords would raise rents, wages would not rise in comparison. Hyperinflation does not hurt banks as they just raise their fees and interest rates.
If wages are in line with inflation in your country I would love to move there

@_date: 2014-02-14 18:14:50
* Person A sends coins to Wallet X, of an amount = 55.00
* This would have a transaction ID of blahblahxxx55xxxblah (ID1)
* Person A then intercepts coins (just the transaction ID) on its way to Wallet X, he changes the amount to something like 00000055.00
* The amount is still the same and the coins will still go to Wallet X.
* However, the transaction ID now looks like -  blahblahxye55xygxblah (ID2)
* The person can now go back to the Exchange and say "look at my transaction ID (ID2), you can see that the coins never got received, so can I haz refund??"
* (the coins really did go to Wallet X and are sat there happily)
* Exchange/wallet provider ONLY looks at the transaction ID and goes "ohh, ye, you're right, here, have more money", and then adds more coin (platform side) to Person A's account.
* Person A then withdraws the free coins.
Hope that helps.
The malleability is changing the transaction ID, which is essentially an 'envelope', and should never only be used to confirm transactions.
example 2 - if you gave me an envelope with £5,000 in notes, then I swapped the envelope with an empty one, and said to you, hey, you gave me an empty envelope, and you just looked at it (without touching or checking) and went, ohh, ok, here, have another.

I'd hazard a guess that the decline in trading is because for xx months it was considered/sold/brought at higher value that it is today.
It is likely that the decline is trade is reflecting the decline in value, and that people (who might've brought at a higher value) are waiting for value to return so that their purchasing power is as strong as they wish it to be.
It's become relatively stable the last month (avg value), my bet is that we're in for a sharp rise within the next few months (just a personal guess), judging from the interest and now that gox echo affects seem to have calmed down.

Hitting the nail on the head without realising it there.
Bitcoin primarily IS a payment (transfer of wealth) method, it is only being used as a 'currency' at the moment, but it can be used for so much more (and it will be in due time).
Do not feel bad about need to base returns in $, you are comparing a 10-12 billion $ market, with a 70+ $ trillion market.
Feel comfortable with returns in $, for now. When Btc is a 10% of Usd, or even 1% of $, then happily base returns in Btc (and keep in mind that Bitcoin is competing with the world fiat currency, not just $).
Currency hedges to protect against the volatility just won't happen yet.
Imagine it like this - the very early adopters took RISK, greater risk than others, and have had greater reward. We are still in the early adopter phase, there will be risk, there is risk.
But there is also the potential for greater reward.
In years to come, when more businesses enter the Bitcoin economy, there will be less risk, and less reward.

Tbh, (in the UK), its a bullshit statement saying crap like "your bank account is insured to blah blah blah"
Your account is insured up to xxx IF you have XXXX in your account, which you will only be able to claim back xx IF you can prove that your account was fraudulently accessed. AND that may/will take up to weeks to succeed, IF it ever does at all.
Have you ever lost money and then tried claiming it back through your bank? My guess is 'no'.
P.s. banks do not pay back fuckall, they MINUS, and then UN-MINUS your account, its your government, or some linked agency that does the 'paying back' (if you've been hacked and IF you're lucky), the bank would otherwise do you over and spit on your debited account before you can say superkalafragilisticexpialidocus.

In other words, you admit defeat and you have no idea what you're talking about, don't worry, I've realised you're a paid troll, plenty of you around this subreddit these days.


Ohhh, now you're being hypocritical and agreeing that your last statement was all bullcrap.


Yes, I refer to them as 'external business wallets', where a business deposits some of its Crypto funds for these purposes, for use by its staff (see, simple).
**did you know** that today's businesses **also** operate a similar model for their business practices?! 


Wow .... Welcome to Bitcoin! (and to contemporary day). Everything is on a public ledger, check out blockchain.info
Also, with today's technology you can have a system setup so you (personally, business or select staff) get emailed, txt'd, every time a transaction/sale goes through.


Ok, you are right, slapping on a QR code for every item you have for sale (assuming you're a commerce site) is not a good idea. That's like, putting £10 for every item because you don't know how to put in different values for different items.
Let me clue you into a little (well known) secret - QR codes can be changed specifically to receive the specific amount you want! (omgosh, shock horror!) - 
Havn't you even used bitcoin-qt? Every 3rd party payment provides a unique QR that changes for the amount. You can even set specific amounts yourself with or without bitcoin-qt.
For charities, donations, political parties and similar, a single QR code would be fine.

A steady growth of customers, unfortunately not a steady growth in trade.
Trade (exchanges) has funneled (again) into the high liquidity exchanges, especially after the gox fiasco.
I'll cut my losses when I'm 6 feet under, its not about the money, its about providing access to financial freedom and developing tools with blockchain tech. And we are still the only fiat &gt; crypto and vice versa that operates without a bank account and can continue to operate without a bank account indefinitely, whilst every other exchange is tied into using a bank account (which is very useful, but also a risk imho).
If every bank in the world determined to close their related digital currency exchange accounts, then we would be the only exchange facilitating fiat &gt; crypto (and vice versa), as far as I am aware (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).
And its very likely that exchanges would come up with alternatives for funding if they lost their bank accounts (btcchina for example, though they still have a primary bank account, they just lost transfer abilities).
edit: and we're implementing something soon which I'm rather looking forward to, which will complete a particular 'circle' that certain people have been trying to do.
Fiat to Crypto and then Crypto to Crypto without any Exchange (business) involved, keeping people within the Cryptocurrency world without the need to submit their identity, with no banks involved.
And when this model spreads ...
And yes, I don't read everything on reddit, so I guess I 'ignore' people (or rather, I don't see what you see). The people I talk with have some excellent ideas about the potential of Blockchain tech and how to achieve and implement this.
What you'd likely refer to as 'altcoins', I refer to as 'Variant applications of Blockchain tech'. Though saying that, there are most definitely plenty of pump n' dump coins that I wouldn't touch with a barge pole.
Anyway, some damn amazing things ahead :)

Then you are one of the lucky ones.
Many people have to worry about rent, food, water, energy, or have to take an emergency loan for a variety of reasons (often medical).
Inflation makes all of these (and more) go up.
Every country that has ever suffered from hyperinflation have had all their costs go up (not down, not frozen).
IF the worlds financial bodies decide to *freeze* all additional costs and interest rate rises (the world over) when hyperinflation hits (instead of bleeding everyone dry thats still stuck in the fiat world), then I will eat a marmite sandwhich..

disclaimer: I am not a coder.
that said, I guess someone (a friend or someone you were working with to fraud an exchange), could submit your transaction id with a changed id and state the coins were not sent. But hopefully any sensible exchange would inquire as to the identity of the person (who is requesting money off you), and quickly realise that its not the account holder.
And the 'someone else' would have trouble accessing the account that the transaction was done from, unless they were given access. Then the account would (should) be frozen and investigations conducted (contacting the real account owner as 1st step).

no, the government ban was on financial institutions in dealing with bitcoin and other crypto's, so that banks and similar institutions couldn't f'up the emerging crypto economy in china by messing around with buying/selling/shorting, etc, etc
So the banks got pissed off and initiated a country wide ban on all their financial institutions in transacting in bitcoin (and other cryptos).
The government was very favourable towards bitcoin  (also the legitimizing exchanges with msb licensing), but the banks took a swing back.

I guess its an UK term.
When boxing was invented, one of the ways for a boxer to lose the fight was if their coach 'threw in the towel', literally threw in the towel into the ring. Signifying that they've just given up the fight on behalf of the boxer.
This generally used to happen if the boxer was getting the &lt;bleepers&gt; knocked out of him but was either 1. too battered to give up, 2. too stubborn to give up.
Hence - "throwing in the towel"

Bitcoins are actually worth Bitcoins, eventually dirty fiat money will mean less than the cotton they're printed on and those with Bitcoins (who aren't already) will be keeping the hell away from that dirty black market fiat (oh yes, it is far better to trade in fiat on the black market, ask any lawyer/criminologist/specialist).

The human brain has a tendency to factor digits to the left of a decimal place as a 'good' thing and digits to the right of a decimal place as 'less than a whole'.
We are educated this way from birth (with the current system).
Hence the common view of Bitcoin with regards to its decimal place is deemed 'unfriendly to the eyes'.
It will probably take a generation to recognise significance of digits to the right of a decimal.
100 years ago children grew up and were educated with far less than we were, and today children are growing up with the internet and touch screens/phones as a normal every day thing.
If we grew up and invented all these things today, what will the next generation develop?
Humans may be 'stupid' (as you say) but we have the capacity to be so much more.

With op's post he clearly states that satoshi mined 70 blocks (roughly), yet still states Satoshi gained 900,000


blocks at this time reward 50 per block.
then he states that the 70x50 mined blocks (3,500 for anyone who knows basic maths or has a calculator) is 7.5% of the current coins in circulation.


Which at this time is roughly 12 million.
So according to OP - Satoshi mined 900,000 bitcoins in 70 blocks, which reward 50 coins per block, and these 3,500 are 7.5% of 12 million ... though assuming he means 900,000 are 7.5% of the 12 million, yet in the same sentence stating he only pre-mined 70 blocks ...
And I love the magically 'pulled out of thin air' 900,000 figure. I rest my case.

The truth about deflation is that inflation is the tool that is used to rob everyone of their wealth. Forget taxes (though taxes are still bad for the most part) and all that, that's just the governments robbing a specific part of your wealth.
Inflation robs everything, every aspect of your wealth is lost with inflation (assuming you live in the fiat world, which most people still do).
Deflation is the natural occurance, inflation is enforced.
E.g. you have to go looking/mining for gold/diamonds, you have to print more money, etc.
In a world with a finite monetary supply deflation occurs naturally. And the true path of the price of products (and services) in a world of progress (e.g. population growth, technology advancements), IS deflation.
Inflation (in the fiat world) is enforced to enable to the 1% to steal everything from the 99%.
If they could tax the air you breath, your health as you grow, the clothes you wear, the legacy you leave your family (oh wait, inheritance tax), then they would have tax closer to inflation.
Everything you have, everything you do, is worth less by the time you've read the end of this post, thanks to inflation.
(and playing devil's advocate, there is (temporarily) inflation in Bitcoin, but its a 'known' level of inflation, and there for a reason. Because of it being known (and unalterable, unless by massive consensus), and that it is there for a particular reason (that I agree with, e.g. paying miners until the network is strong/big enough that transaction fees will supplant coins produced). It is far more acceptable (to me anyway).

Please check depreciation of the USD over the last 100 years (something like 97% loss of value).
Then check how the roman empire collapsed due to inflation and its military industrial complex.
Then compare how in roman times it ended up costing more money to create money (because of inflation/depreciation of their currency).
Then check how it costs roughly 2.5 cents to make 1 cents (USD).
Then observe how everyone (that is able) and every country is gold grabbing.

Urm, are you purposefully contradicting yourself? You stated the 3600 mined as 'inflationary', yes, it is. But its **unrealised inflationary supply** until its converted into fiat.

Dude ... 3,500 compared to 'all bitcoin outstanding'? what number do you place for 'all bitcoin outstanding'?
Just asking, because people come out with different numbers, mostly I hear within the millions. So you've just gone from comparing 3,500 to 900,000, to comparing 3,500 to millions ... (ofc depending of your definition of 'all bitcoin outstanding'.
edit: don't get me wrong, I wouldn't scoff at 3,500 coins, but the comparisons you're using are just plain wrong. When you change the OP to "he mined 3,500 coins in the first days!", you might want to re-look at it and compare the numbers with whats out there and you'll realise that what he mined is relatively insignificant, especially considering he mined them when they were not even comparable to fiat (or any other asset) or usable anywhere.

Tell me, are the majority of people forced to use fiat over bitcoin?
(my answer: no)
Why do you think that the majority of people use fiat over bitcoin?
(my answer: trickery, and admittedly there's a lot of infrastructure still to be built, but its perfectly feasible to move over to use bitcoin instead of fiat for most things nowadays)
No one forces me to use fiat, I have to use it in some cases to pay specific bills, this is a trick of the system by integrating itself so that it (almost) becomes indispensable, but this is becoming less and less.
Still, there is no one with guns trying to force me to use fiat for most of the things I pay for, mostly I use bitcoin.
The majority of (pro fiat) people I've discussed fiat/bitcoin with wholeheartedly believe that without fiat the world will crumble into dust or something equally extravagant along those lines, because their government told them so.

You simply check whether their transaction went through or not with a click (or few clicks) of the mouse, checking various things (timestamp, addresses, trans id, etc).

Ok, as per your edit.
You're saying 3,500 bitcoins are 7.5% of current outstanding bitcoins.
So, only 46,000 bitcoins are outstanding? fair enough if thats you're estimate.
By that maths, sure, if 46,000 bitcoins are all thats outstanding (mostly I hear that millions are not used), but if you're thinking only 46,000 are not used and that nearly 12 million bitcoins are being transacted and used semi-regularly. 
Then sure, 3,500 bitcoins, a total of 7.5% of the outstanding bitcoins, still will not cause anyone to even blink ...
As a note - we are talking **pre-mined** coins. I am sure that he mined more than 3,500 over the years.

you're still saying that he pre-mined 900,000 bitcoins in 70 blocks ..
arrrgh .... my brain is squeaking...
70 x 50 = 3,500 .. I don't know how else to put it ... IF he had pre-mined 900,000, I would agree with you. The point is, he did **not** and 3,500 is a vastly different number than 900,000.
IF you're talking about the total amount of coins Satoshi ever mined (and maybe still mining), sure, whatever! 
Same thing can be said about dozens of other people who mine and have large quantities of bitcoins. Hence, you should change your title and content of the OP to - Anyone who has a large amount of coins, and not make it anything about Satoshi, because its irrelevant.
edit: anyone with 50,000+ can probably influence the market, just the same as anyone with $billions can influence various fiat related markets. I understand your post, but you should widen the concept to anyone with a large amount of coin (which would likely include Satoshi, but quite a few others)

"However, in all instances, VAT will be due in the normal way from suppliers of any goods or **services** sold in exchange for Bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrency."
Keyword 'services'. Exchanges provide a service, which they get recompensated by charging the commission fee. This 'Service Fee' (commission fee) is subject to VAT.
Mining income is recognised, but exempt from VAT.
"1. Income received from Bitcoin mining activities will generally be outside the scope of VAT on the basis that the activity does not constitute an economic activity for VAT purposes because there is an insufficient link between any services provided and any consideration received."
Basically, its because miners are 'mining' for themselves and not providing a 'service' to anyone (the protocol (DAC) is not a recognized entity at this time. And they are not selling goods to anyone. However, when those miners convert Bitcoin (or other crypto-currency) to fiat, they are profiting. £0 to whatever £ they selling it for. This comes under Income Tax (check thresholds).
You're not paying VAT, but you are liable to tax as profit/income.

One way of looking at it is that;
Bitcoin &amp; Fiat are static.
People (the world) are volatile - as they bounce from either currency plying their business/trade/individual needs.
It is not the Bitcoin or Fiat that is purposefully bouncing up and down in value (Btc more than fiat), but the people that are bouncing up and down in their needs and wants.

Ok, firstly, I'm not a programmer, I never said I was. And even I can integrate Bitcoin payment systems most platforms and for websites and physical stores.


(btw, this point itself shows **very** clearly that either you know very little about Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and the Protocol, or your just a paid shibe trolling as you do)
The point is - **its not supposed to!** 


Eh what? A business does stock taking and replenishment without access to its business bank accounts. There are people specifically employed to do this in various industries who do **not** have access to the company account.


Again - you do **not** need access to a business bank account to do this. Similar - you do **not** need access to the bitcoin wallet (wherever its being held) to do these.
I seriously wonder what kind of business you're into that requires all this ...honest question.


What are your issues? don't you know the code for a specific payment 3rd party service? you don't know how to copy in html or something? you've already admitted copy/paste is a pretty damn easy thing to do .. sooo ... ye ..
If you can't find a programmer and can't learn how to do it yourself, then just ask bitpay, coinbase, or one of the other emerging services, its EXTREMELY EASY. I mean, you've gotta wear a paper bag over your head and facepalm a wall with your face a fair few times to even start to make it difficult (if you know basic programming) .. 
Otherwise, if you're having problems, just ask someone, plenty of people around here who can help you.

I put forward that more governments than you realise are having talks with individuals and groups within the bitcoin space and that over the next few years you will be rather surprised.
There are some very intelligent people at certain levels in government, some countries do actively recruit the best of the best of the students that they can find and have been doing so for many years.


3.3 Monetary and financial stability
Digital currencies, as an alternative to fiat currencies issued by central authorities ... (
The fact that the UK government acknowledges that a nation might (one day) adopt digital currencies instead of fiat currencies conflicts with your views.
Edit: It matters to governments. What you are stating shows an understanding only of the 1st application, keep in mind, bitcoin is the 1st application of blockchain technology, this application as the form of a type of money will enable people to finance the other applications of blockchain tech.
If we're talking about whether 'bitcoin' will be around in 50 years time, maybe, maybe not, but will blockchain tech be around in 50 years, definitely. And then when you realise that, ask yourself "what will future applications of the tech be?"
It will never be valued like gold, because it is not gold, it is far better.
Gold is a **type** of money, that particular type of money can also be used for other things, like jewelry, computer parts, and for other components (eventually it will only be used for building materials and maybe still as jewelry).
Blockchain tech is also a **type** of money, but the other applications we've only just started exploring. Votes, stocks/shares, medical, licensing, tort (contract), inheritance, A.I, automated services, transport, and I am sure there is plenty that I can't think of off the top of my head.
Just remember, bitcoin may be amazing, but its only the 1st application (which will fund the future applications). The ones who are already professing 'long term' ideology are those that see the potential applications, its not just about the economy.

- Less merchant costs for using Bitcoin than a fiat system.
- Far easier to integrate.
- You can't get blocked by visa/mastercard/insertfiatpayment system.
- You can't get your business bitcoin address frozen/stolen (until they change it to fiat, and then they'll learn).
- Bitcoin is built to be deflationary (finite supply), so, as the people from 4-5 years ago learned, deflationary = gooooood (and also natural, but thats a different discussion). Business wise, more money = good = growth.
Fiat system (visa/mastercard, etc) takes their sizable cut. For a business those few % can mean a LOT.

Depends on country, age, credit rating (if applicable), and if the person has a physical mailing address (which often is a problem for the unbanked).
I live in the UK and have known plenty of people who can't get one (even a pre-paid).
Recently had this discussion with someone here -  -
(disclaimer: self promotion bit)
If you're in the UK then we can help you out, I replied as;
tl;dr - IBWT does not use a bank account, you can deposit via Royal Mail (any post box, any office), and Royal Mail have specific services for mailing hard currency (and they are very helpful over the counter).
Royal Mail also offer excellent cover, which generally works out cheaper than international transfers (cover is not needed, you can deposit with just the price of a stamp, but we **highly** recommend that customers use the Royal Mail cover).
We don't charge markups, people put their own value/price down, you can view the trade windows without registering an account or logging in (we do charge 0.3% on transactions (buy/sell)).
If you are depositing via Royal Mail then you only need to register an account via an email address (if you are withdrawing via Royal Mail then you need to register a withdrawal address, but we do process withdrawals direct to banks, assuming your bank has a branch in Plymouth, which most do).
Deposits via Royal Mail take 24-48 hours, depending when you post your deposit and dependent on bank holidays (think postman mailing days).
Also, we don't require identification for withdrawal of **your** coins (we do employ an email 2fa for withdrawal, for a little added security for customers).
Feel free to email us at support or me personally at joeld if you have any questions.

Eh .. I don't think you're reading what I'm typing .. or you're being purposefully strange.
I agreed that **I was wrong** in the 'Shoot a welsh person', I even showed specifically what the point was also, AND I typed that 'no' its not legal anymore.
Did you not notice that I linked you the specifics and copy/pasted it here ..? Obviously you must've noticed seeing as you also read the document (or at least scanned it) and also copy/pasted information back.
Did you also notice how I originally stated that some UK laws are retarded and are ignored because they do not compute in todays society.
And I also provided links to the same piece I put forth, you copied back, etc, etc, and also shows other silly old UK laws that are not enforced, but are still **law**
Which I copy/pasted an example (from the law commission link I also provided for you), such as the 'illegal to be drunk in a drinking establishment'.
You did read that right? So .. ye, you have this attitude of **everyone must obey the law, because its law**.
Less than year old, and far more than 3 pence in revenue, and plenty of users thanks. Goooood ad hominen attack.
Nice that you brought up the exchange because that really really dismisses the Law Commission, the fact that I showed I was wrong, and the fact that you seem unable to admit you're wrong yourself.
So tell us all that you would **obey** every law that is still law in the UK (so we can all see what kind of mind ticks behind you).
It is illegal to handle salmon in suspicious circumstances.  - Yes This is an offence under the Salmon Act 1986.
It is illegal to be drunk on licensed premises. (yes)
It is illegal to beat or shake any carpet or rug in any street. However, beating or 
shaking a doormat is allowed before 8am. (yes)
And other daft stuff (which not all of it is included in that particular pdf).
Honestly, I can't be asked to do research for you when you seem to just want to act like a delinquently excited shill.
Obey all the UK laws if you wish, and if you really are of the mindset that **you must obey the law because its the law**. 
Then I feel very sorry for you friend, and I wish you the best of luck getting out from where you are.

It means you made £100 profit. If your profit exceeds certain thresholds then you're liable for tax - 


Nope, (there is no registry or regulator for crypto exchanges in the UK at this time, they just need to register as a business).

Ok, let me ask you this.
Has mortgage prices remained 100% stock still for everyone since the day they start their mortgage?
Do people find that their loan repayments (or hire purchase, or whatever repayments), **change** due to inflation, or or they forever the same?
E.g. Does interest go up/down on your loan amount over time, or does it **never** change?
edit: again, with the housing example - prices go **up** due to inflation. I'm not sure if you've ever noticed prices of bread, milk, water, energy, etc, it has all been going up steadily (and in some cases rapidly).
This is because of inflation.
IF you have a loan, mortgage, etc, it 'increases over time because of inflation'. It seems that you think that when hyperinflation hits *every* financial organisation will freeze all their added interests (and probably extra charges).
Opposed to increasing them steadily/rapidly to coincide with current inflation. Must admit, really curious why you think this ... its contradicting yourself terribly..
**TL;DR** - you seem to think that whilst everything increases in costs steadily with inflation, that everything will have a 'price freeze' when hyperinflation hits. Sadly that's not the case (e.g. just do some research on every country that has suffered from hyperinflation)
.. ahh, honestly, I'm gonna give up, its not my job to teach you economics and you can easily google 'inflation'. 
If you don't understand inflation and hyperinflation I suggest research, as you will be able to research things that you can digest easier rather than listening to a random person on reddit trying to explain it to you.

People who do research on economic potential and then buy into whatever it is they have been considering - if its 'lucky timing', then anyone anywhere who has ever brought stock, oil, precious metals/gems, started a .com business, etc, etc.. Is all just 'lucky timing'?
I knew of Bitcoin in early 2011, then later 2011, then early 2012, and then finally did some research and acquired some in late 2012.
IF I had done my research in early 2011 the result would have been the same, I would have invested a small portion of my wealth until I could learn more (obviously in hindsight I wish I had liquidated everything I had and gone pure bitcoin back in late 2012 when I first got some, but hindsight is always 20/20).
Some people buy for their 1st time as an experiment, or for other reasons, and for these I agree, lucky timing. Some people do research and place their decision on what others might refer to as a 'entrepreneur choice'.

Gold reserve ended in 1971, thanks to the US &amp; Nixon.
We've been living in a pure Fiat world for the last 42 years, its the 1st time the world has ever had a monetary system purely based on **faith in a government** 
Considering the constant banking scandals and (probably) inevitable collapse of the global economy, do **you** think this Fiat experiment has been a success?
Or a failure?
edit: IF you really think that the USD is backed by Gold then you my friend need to do a fair bit more research. To get a clearer understanding of the financial joke/prison we're living in takes a good 4-6 months of study, maybe more depending on your retention abilities.
Basically -
The US stole most of the worlds gold during &amp; after WWII, private investors (banks, rothschilds, rothschild agents) have slowly brought up all the gold from the government by playing a very clever game of debt (which is a win-win scenario for those that hold the cards, e.g. rothschilds &amp; quite likely Nixons family &amp; co since before 1971).
Buying up all this gold has put them in THE best position, globally, for when they destroy the global fiat economy. When it all goes tits up (when hyperinflation hits world wide, which it will), then those holding the gold will be **extremely** rich, and those holding the most gold will literally be able to buyout governments (yes, its already been happening with fiat, e.g. check countries that use the USD as their currency, not counting the US).

It's better that you read the law commissions report on retarded old UK laws.
You'll have to try to trust me on this - the UK Law Commission is a far more reliable source when it comes to UK law than the BBC.
Specifically - 
And I put forward that the poor old woman could have been so scared of the USSA authorities that she hid her fiat rather than attempt to declare it (for fear it would be stolen if she did declare it).
Personally, I would've just signed the whatever documents (assuming she had a legit reason).
Or she could have been smuggling it for international drug cartels, or for some other nefarious reason that either an elderly woman was forced into, or she's the mastermind. 
Which then she should get fined as HSBC, a proportional amount, I think someone worked it out as roughly $354 (or so).
P.s. It is legal to shoot a Welshman with a longbow on Sunday in the Cathedral Close in Hereford; or inside the city walls of Chester after midnight; or a Scotsman within the city walls of York, other than on a Sunday - (answer 'no')
Also - It is (still) illegal to be drunk on licensed premises. (laymans: it is illegal in the UK to be drunk in any pub, nightclub or similar).
(my point, which you may or may not remember, is that in the UK we have retarded laws that have not been repealed, IF you **must obey the law, because its law**, then you're screwed if you come to the UK)

if you read the original government announcement its said right there .. just people prefer twisting it to bad news (possibly to fiddle the market, but to be fair, it was still bad news, just not as bad as people made out), and I guess it helps to have some experience of reading legal/political jargon

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA .... consumer protection. Riiiiight ... You mean the ability to perform fraud and scam businesses. For most honest consumers there is NO protection, trying to get funds back from a bank is an impossibility.
And its utter bullshit about FCA/insert your countries 'consumer protection', covering your funds. For example - in the UK, the FCA only has funds to cover just under 3% of fiat for when things go tits up. Also, the statement that such organisations cover up to £/$xxxxx, is a mistruth - IF you have FAR higher than the amount you're trying to claim back, THEN you can get a small % of what you lost.
It does not work like - "you lost 10k, you can claim 10k back (from government, banks don't give bugger all back)" - it works like - "you lost 10k, you can claim back £/$500, maybe 1k, if you're lucky"

If you mine, earn coins, buy an item, then sell that item for Bitcoins (or other crypto), and you make a profit.
Then you are exempt from CGT.
Mining itself is exempt, earnings from mining is exempt (this applies to Bitcoin and all crypto-currency).
Overall, it encourages crypto holders to keep their crypto as crypto.




edit: correction, possible to still be liable for CGT, depending on how you're pricing the item. In a pure btc world, it gets tricky.

These things take a lot of time, and even when you plan it, they take longer. And lets just say that people working on trezor are extremely likely also working on other projects (I know some are). 
And its far better to have a 100% working trezor than a 99% working models being sent out.

So you're saying that if you brought bitcoins at £5 each, then (years later) bitcoin rises to a value of £350 each, you buy items worth £1,000 (paying the relevant tax). You think you would be liable for CGT on the increase in value on your bitcoins? even though you never touched fiat.
You can go ahead and try to pay the CGT (I'm sure HMRC won't mind), IF you can find the HMRC bitcoin wallet address (good luck), but we'll just have to agree to disagree on this point.

Edit: 'UK based', a better explanation would be - likely to affect the entire commonwealth, and seeing as various banks have their HQ's here, if things work out well and we get the banks on board (with allowing businesses to have bank accounts), then the effects will very likely reach outwards on a global scale (through those banks).

Maybe for you.
For others its -
1.	Lower fees
2.	Lower transactions
3.	No barrier to adoption
4.	Far far easier to adopt than card machines
5.	Cheaper than card machines (from a business PoV)
6.	No overdraft charges (you are your own bank)
7.	A far FAR higher rate of 'room to grow' (e.g. increase in value) than it can decrease.
8.	Does not rely on bank trust (have you looked at the economy lately?)
9.	Does not have 'middle-men' (it is FULLY INCLUSIVE!) 9.1 - no more stolen funds from 'charities' 9.2 - no more massive cuts for businesses and individuals when send money anywhere (to friends or for buying goods) 9.3 - no ability for the banks and corrupt powers that be to STOP your transactions
10.	Banks and governments can not seize your wealth (unless they waterboard you and you give up your password).
11.	Whenever you use your credit/debit card you are GIVING full access to your card details to whoever is on the other side (phone or net), and they can then use your details and spend your money.
12.	Point 11 does not compute with Bitcoin (its impossible).
13.	Bitcoin is HIGHLY fraud resistant.
14.	Bitcoin is very young and has amazing potential to grow and develop (9.0 will be very interesting).
15.	There is a limit to how much you can withdraw from an ATM and/or from your Bank.
16.	There is a limit to how much money (fiat/paper money) you can take with you when you go abroad.
17.	Officials (or anyone) can steal your money whilst you travel, etc.
18.	15, 16, and 17 does not apply to Bitcoin.
19.	Bitcoin is open source!! (extremely important!)
20.	All addresses are publicly viewable!!! (amagad! yes really, imagine if you could see all the corruption in government and official bodies, because you could see exactly who was donating/bribing what and how much).
21.	Imagine, you're in tescos (or a bus, or any other shop, etc), there are huge queues, people are paying with their change, and you're having to wait for credit card transactions to go through. 30 minutes later you finally get served.
22.	Imagine, you're in tescos, etc, there are huge queues, everyone takes 10-20 seconds to pay, because all they have to do is &gt; face phone to screen, push phone (send) button, done.
23.	Taxes. Imagine all the stupidly rich and corrupt (individuals and businesses) could no longer hide all their taxes (freaking government preaches about tax evasion, when really its the millionaires and the corps that do 90% (probably more) of the tax evasion). Imagine the economy recovering from all that wealth coming back into the system.
24.	Accountability. Imagine politicians and those in power being held accountable for their actions.
25.	Inflation (end of). Hyperinflation is incoming, government has lied about inflation for quite a long time. If you really want to see the true rates of inflation look at the value of milk, bread, a chocolate bar, etc, over the last 10 years, that will give you a good example of the true rate. 25.1 - The bitcoin protocol actually has inflation also ('mining'), but at FAR lesser rate (in value) and with a system that steadily decreases over time.
26.	Deflation - Natural deflation is the real state of an economy. Inflation is a lie, and has been used as a tool to control the masses and divert wealth to the extremely few. Bitcoin suffers from natural deflation (which is a VERY GOOD thing!).
27.	Uncontrollable bankers. Banks are too big and corrupt to stop head on, there are way too many politicians in the bankers pockets (and the army).
28.	Accessible financial services for the billions of unbanked.
29.	Replacement for most tort (contract) law.
30.	DACs (Decentralised Autonomous Corporations).
Also, HMRC (in the UK) are pushing to have the power to access individuals bank accounts (**not Big Business**), so that they can take money (taxes owed) from peoples accounts without any legal action (at the moment you have to get a court warrant for such things).
Now imagine this gets pushed through (probably likely), and in a couple of years time the government (UK) says, "ohh, we need more taxes".
Just watch as your fiat bank accounts get drained, whilst of course inflation ('QE') means that taxes will constantly rise (at a far higher % than your wages, unless you're a bank owner/exec).

Don't listen to the FUD. Your coin remains on the same chain, it won't lose value (unless the whole ecosystem loses value, as per standard).
It's only newly minted coins that are minted on the smaller chain (after Fork) then will no (or very little) value.
**Imagine it like this -** I forked Bitcoin 3 years ago and made my own crypto to mess around with.
Are my coins that I mined after my fork usable on the main chain? - No.
Are any coins I had on the chain/network **before** I forked it still worth anything/usable? - Yes.
Did your coins disappear and the bitcoin ecosystem collapse because I made a fork? - No.
If you check here -  - top right corner, there's a Fork button, try it, it doesn't bite (assuming you're logged in). Sometimes I find the best way to learn something is through experience.
@_date: 2016-01-19 20:26:43
It's a simplified version of my explanation. And hopefully it encourages people to test it out for themselves.  Anyone can make a fork (and with suitable enough programming skills) then change the PoW so that your new chain becomes an 'altcoin'. But the coins you mine will still be 'bitcoin' (kind of).
It's a case use example (which hopefully some will try) to show how forking and coins on different chains integrate (or not, as is the case).
@_date: 2016-01-12 10:43:25
Yes, though because of our current banking setup transactions are processed every 2hrs from 08:00 to 18:00. We will make this more regular as we grow throughout this year, and when we have individual accounts/sort codes integrated later this year then it will be even faster/smoother.

Mostly, I think its unfortunately carried past that over the last half year. I feel that some bickering, bitterness and unkind words have set some people in stone.
Now it's become "blocksize, and who you like in charge of development?"
It's also an argument about the fundamental nature of bitcoin. The pro-small blocks side want to turn bitcoin into a settlement layer for other applications. The pro-big blocks side want bitcoin to remain low-free on fees and want it to be usable for everyone (directly on the network, not via 3rd party applications/software).
The small block side also want it usable for everyone, but state that this is only possible by turning it into a settlement layer, that small transactions (such as paying for coffee) are all spam transactions and should be occurring offchain.
Then there is SegWit (lauded by Core as the temporary solution until LN), however this will require a complete upgrade/re-writing for everyone in the bitcoin sector (businesses, etc). And then LN itself, which sounds fantastic on paper, but sorry to say that it is still vaporware. And then there's a certain business (that I can't mention here) that could have certain financial interests in keeping the block size small and offering their own solutions, coincidentally pay the salary of certain lead core developers and other 'leaders' in the field.
Pro-big blocks don't like the apparent conflict of interest. Pro-small blocks deny there is any conflict of interest. And then there's the 'silencing' that is done in (and other relevant places). That puts people who brought into Satoshi's original vision (a "peer-2-peer cash", not "a settlement system") at odds with Core development and future planned design.
So it's evolved into more than just 'blocksize', its now also become a matter of 'who do you trust'.

By 'cashing out' I assume you mean 'withdraws his crypto'.
If the exchange is accepting coins from both chains, then they will exist separately. Two clients, two trading windows, a Corecoin window and a Classiccoin window.
Let's say you deposited fiat, brought Classiccoin, withdrew. You would need to a Classiccoin client to withdraw to, otherwise your withdrawal with not be valid. For example, it would be the same if you tried withdrawing litecoin to a bitcoin wallet.
If you brought Corecoin on the exchange, then you would need to withdraw to a Corecoin client.
If the exchange did not label which coin was which, and just had 1 version (then it's probably the majority version, which would be Classic), then there's no way to tell unless you ask the exchange, or attempt withdrawing.


If they are using Classic client (majority), no problem. Classic will not exist until it becomes the majority.
If they are using Core client (minority), then the user would need to have a compatible Core client wallet (spv or personal) to be able to withdraw the coin. At this point Corecoin would be an altcoin (same genesis, different chains and incompatible post-fork).

There are no fees. You send your FPS and the team checks transactions every 2hrs from 08:00 till 18:00 (barring bank holidays and Sundays). At this time you need to make sure you use your Fidor ID (for deposits) also.
The other very interesting things that I have not mentioned in this thread yet is;
- Internal transfer from Fidor customer to Fidor customer = instant.
- Fidor customers have access to an internal messaging system (which we obviously have a record of), so you can safely protect yourself when transacting with bitcoin.
Feel free to join the community ( which you don't need a bank account to join, but you can interact and discuss with fellow Fidor users (and mods) as to the ease (and problems) of using Fidor for your needs.

It's a scenario that will never exist.
Your coins will be perfectly safe. You will **still** be able to spend your coins at any place that accepts bitcoin.
The confusion is here - IF you are a miner, and the chain forks (one of XT/BU/Classic takes over), and then you (as a miner) mine coins on a smaller chain (e.g. Classic takes over, but you are still mining on Core). 
**Then** your **newly minted** coins will not be usable on the new primary chain (e.g. Classic). Meaning, any merchants that move/accept Classic won't be able to accept your newly minted (after fork) coins.
Your older (pre-fork) coins are perfectly fine and safe.

We use FPS, but as someone else has noted its currently routed through another bank, as such we only process transactions every 2hrs from 08:00 till 18:00.

That it introduces a 3rd element turning Bitcoin into 'needing a trusted 3rd party'.
If you are fine with that, ok.
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:35:11
tl;dr: 1mb = back to trusted 3rd parties as blockstream(s, more will appear) control (and can censor) what goes into the network.
Users will also have to gain access to these 3rd parties to use the network, goodbye financial inclusion.
Bitcoin was created to remove the need for reliance on trusted 3rd parties.
Here's another interesting (but small) thread from 2013 - 
In the long term vision that some have (reserve currency with national cryptos), bitcoin simply will not be able to function as a reserve under 1mb and needing to go through 3rd parties.
And whether you despise, respect, or dismiss Satoshi, a lot of people were attracted to bitcoin because;






And the attacks towards XT and Gavin are disturbing. Censoring XT debate, a threat to attack the XT network, emails from Blockstream to get Gavin removed from the Bitcoin Foundation (not that that position there overly means much these days anyway), and requests to have Gavin's commit access removed.
p.s. it was Mike who pushed forward with XT, not Gavin, attacking Gavin because he endorses XT (or rather, he endorses larger block size, but has ended up supporting XT due to it simply 'not happening' in Core), is just a bit.. hmm (can't attack Mike, lets attack Gavin!), we all get our temper moments, but those that have done this should sit back and take a time out.
Well done guys, for turning into the type of people I imagine that most of us were trying to move away from, well done, *golf clap*.
End of the day, Satoshi in his wisdom released Bitcoin as OSS, and the market will decide. I think we would already know what outcome would be forced on us if it was closed sourced.

More specialized mining 'farms' (factories would be a better term), or access to the bitcoin network only through 3rd party businesses.
Which would you prefer?
Edit: Larger block size = bandwidth, storage, associated costs.
1mb forever = Blockstream(s, as more will appear) taking up all that 1mb of transaction space.
Then ask yourself .. what was the primary problem that bitcoin was trying (and did) solve?
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:47:09


Please provide more relevant sources and I will see that they are added.


When the 1mb limit is reached on average, how will users get their transactions through the network? (without competing with the businesses re: (higher) transaction fees)


Based upon the last 6 years growth, assuming the same rate of growth. If you can provide sources/information that states the 8mb will be reached far quicker (or slower) I will see that they are added.
Your suggestion for an alternative title is also appreciated.
Anyone and everyone can add their own relevant links when they put in their opinion.

Your transactions gets chosen and put in a block (normally chosen because of the fee you attach)
1a. Your transaction goes in a block.
2a. Miner confirms block.
The 1mb model will = 
1b. Your transaction goes to blockstream(s)
2b. Blockstream(s) decide to include your transaction (and lump it together with others)
3b. This then gets sent forward to the network.
4b. (see 1a above)
5b. (see 2a above)
What happens when/if blockstream gets subpoenaed, or bitlicensed?
1c. Submit identification to blockstream.
2c. Hope you are not censored due to whatever morality police choose.
3c. Hope you are not living in a sanctioned country.
4c. Hope you can gain access to blockstream(s) if you are living in a 3rd world country.
Now we get to 1b, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, 1a, 2a.
Insert - "pay fee" - at any time in the 'b' or 'c' model.
Block'stream is aptly named.

Well, I've been having a discussion most the night (and now morning) with Maxwell, he disagrees with you.
He states that its not a third party.
Whether or not its a 'trusted' third party is a moot point to me, its the 'reliance' on a 3rd party that is in question.
So, we have 2 knowledgable people (yourself and maxwell), who are arguing the same thing, but disagree with each other about whether or not LN is a 3rd party. Do you change your opinion and agree with Maxwell? Or do you stand your ground and continue to state "yes, it is a 3rd party".

   |      ---   &gt; Miners/network
User B /
LN User A  \
   |    ---   &gt; Submit to network &gt; Miners/Network
LN User B  /
If LN is not a 3rd party service, then Exchanges are not 3rd party services.
If LN is a P2P network and does not require the bitcoin network (which obviously it does), then why bother submitting to the network.
If I wire transfer you money, then what is the point of the banks. Are wire transfers a P2P network?
I can't find any definition of a Peer2Peer network that relies on submitting the information to a 3rd party for confirmation, I would be happy if you could point me towards one.
IF LN is basically its own bitcoin network, then it does not need to submit the information.
Think I will leave this conversation here as clearly your definition of reliance on a 3rd party differs greatly and I do not think you would see it any other way.
I have no issue with 3rd party services, I think LN (and blockstream) will provide amazingly useful tools. Exchanges obviously provide a very useful function (but are still not p2p networks). What I have an issue with is turning bitcoin into reliant upon a 3rd party service. That's just co'opting the network.
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:45:32
I was talking about LN, or any other service that would offer solutions/services to allow users to interact with the network.

Edit: Section 5 is also a good read. Key points - offchain transactions, establishing payment service providers. If you are stating that the linked document(pdf) does not describe 3rd party solutions, then ok, I can point out key paragraphs, the abstract, etc, that describe it as a 3rd party solution. If going through the pdf does not show you, then ok, we'll just have to agree to disagree.

The 8mb plan is also to increase it further when appropriate in the future.
Without looking at graphs and going by your numbers I'm guessing around 5.5 years to fill 8mb avg?
If we consider the last 5 years HDD/SDD/storage growth/cost and bandwidth (though that varies from country to country), then the cost of downloading and running a node should actually be cheaper than it is today.
Please note, I've only just done the numbers roughly in my head (and they are based on UK figures) so take that with a pinch of salt.
"In 2010, a 256 SSD was ~$500. Today, under $200." -  (2013)
Today, 250gb ssd, roughly $150 - 
Cost of bandwidth -  (from 2012)
The figures speak for themselves, I probably should do some decent comparative graphs at some point.
Terabyte SSD's were hardly (if at all) commercially available 5 years ago, what will be available in 5 more years?
tl;dr - the people saying "omg costs will be soo bad and no one can afford bandwidth and storage" are talking FUD (or simply have not looked at the numbers properly).
edit: Have some more interesting analysis links -  (2010 costs and predictions)
 (2013)
I can't find something for 2015 right now, but you can see from the last 2 the accuracy and judge yourself whether the decline in costs and increase in bandwidth (and storage) will continue (it is very likely).

They're not trying to ban encryption anymore, they recently took a u-turn in that stance. The UK gov department/cabinet is now advising all gov departments to have appropriate encryption.
source: 
**Encrypt without compromising performance**
Implement encryption at the most optimal point for performance and cost. Application encryption is better optimised, needs less infrastructure and is easier for the user to verify than network encryption. This is particularly true for bandwidth-intensive peer-to-peer communications such as voice and video. Application encryption could also be extended to protect communications with individual citizens on public networks if needed.

I should have added 'limit' in the metaphorical example.
Yes potential for DoS attacks exist in 1mb, 8mb or any other size. The 1mb limit has had its share, and there were similar attacks before the 1mb limit was installed (hence the reason for the 1mb limit).
Are they costly? Relatively, yes.

Absolutely agreed.


Not sure if I've said it in this thread or not, so my apologies if I repeat myself - Blockstream can operate fine with a larger block size, a larger block = a bigger cake for all, keeping it at 1mb = Blockstream(s) get to stuff the small cake in their face and not leave any for anyone else.
edit: and just so no one misunderstand my words, I don't mean an unlimited block size, as that way lies ddos attacks, but the incremental increase so that there's always some cake for anyone who wants some.

Ye, I miswrote that, I was half asleep earlier, he flatly said its not a third party service.


And again Maxwell disagrees with you. I asked him what will users have to use when the 1mb is constantly full, he stated LN (or similar style services).
So, I hope you see the reason for my lack of faith there. You both agree, yet disagree on the fundamentals.
e.g. - third party service - everyone needing to use it when the 1mb is constantly full.

Through 3rd party services (be it Blockstream or any other business that copies the model). It is kind of a very important part of the debate, bitcoin was created to bypass the need for trusted 3rd parties (as I know you are aware).
When the 1mb is constantly full from transactions forwarded by 3rd party services, how else do you expect users to 
use the network? (unless they offer a competetive fee)


Ok? Can you provide alternative suitable stats or source of information for past rate of growth. Rate of growth is also an important factor in the debate.
I am at a loss if you think users needing to go through 3rd party services to use the network, nor the past and predicted rate of growth is not relevant to this debate.
@_date: 2015-08-18 14:07:28

Ok, my point is - when 1mb is constantly full, will users be able to directly transact with the network, or will they have to go through trusted 3rd party services? - unless the user offers a competitive transaction fee -
(3rd party services that will generally be forwarding higher transaction fees)

if r/bitcoin seriously thinks that Bitcoin only enables 1.8 transactions per LIFETIME per person ...
i don't even know how this computes in your head .... truly fascinating
and a transaction uses up the same energy as a house over 3 weeks .. really? tell me more? so all the people making more than 2 transactions in their LIFETIMES are breaking the laws of reality or something?
and every penny tip or simple transaction i've made (and i've made a LOT over the years) could've powered a house for 3 weeks?? wow .. do our computers turn into super computers when we run bitcoin? yet somehow.. even now, when sending transactions.. i can watch my electricty meter and see its not spiking in energy usage..
wierd huh? maybe bitcoin is some kind of "singularity" ;) that gives super powered energy or something? ok, i'm just lol'ing.. seriously think about it though, if you were right.. wouldn't that be cool ;)

At a rough 'guess' (and we are many months away), exchanges, and platforms (such as BitBargain) will have to register as an MSB, users who transact a small amount (not yet defined) will not have to provide identification.

Hi everyone,
If you are not aware, Fidor (UK) have gained their UK banking license (25th Sept) and you can open a current account with them. Average time is 1-2 weeks to open.
They do Faster Payment. They are bitcoin friendly, no you can't purchase/sell bitcoin directly from them, but you can use your Fidor account for whatever reasons you want.
Obviously if you are sending/receiving large amounts you might be queried (a query does not equal account closure). They are not afraid of bitcoin and your account is your account.
Debit cards and direct debit &amp; standing orders, are not here (yet), they are coming (rough eta will be given within a fortnight, or sooner).
Other things potentially in discussion - p2p lending, crowdfunding, loans, ethical lending.
Bitcoin/crypto integration is coming, but I can't give any date on that at this time (after UK regulations, and I can't give any date that either, sorry), and whether that will be direct on Fidor or with a partner, I can't give any information on that yet either (I do however have some very interesting ideas on how to progress in this direction).
* Note: Currently all customers have the same sort code &amp; account number (separated by your Fidor ID), we are working towards separate SC &amp; AN's for all customers, this will come in due time (sooner rather than later).
As you may, or may not, know, I've been in the crypto space for quite a few years and have done stuff in the background over this period, this is just the start of what we've all been waiting for :)
If you have questions please feel free to post here, or on the Fidor community site.
(you need to be a UK resident to have an account with Fidor UK)
*Disclaimer:* I recently got recruited by Fidor.

It's nearly 5am here so I might have to get back to you on this. But registering is rather straight forward and simple, no electronic bills, or proof of residence needed.
Give it a prod and if you have any issues feel free to pm me via reddit or via the Fidor community platform.

Apologies if I missed it, have not seen the Bitnodes incentives program brought up in this thread. More info - 
I am assuming, that if you are getting rewarded for running a node, then this offsets the cost.

As Gary said, it's good news (I'd say great news, personally). Not taking us to the moon, plenty of work still to be done.

Hi I have discussed the matter with the team, attach your relevant bills to an email to hello (referencing your account/name/etc).
This will be accepted, give me a prod if you have any issues.

Not a problem, the exchange business isn't the only thing I'm involved in, it is but one part of the puzzle.
One thing that has always confounded me .. bitcoin was created in part to help the unbanked .. yet with most exchanges you need a bank account to get bitcoin.

Unfortunately, not without a UK business account, or without risk to the customer. We won't/can't use a personal account for business.
We say an average of 3 days for Royal Mail, to cover unforeseen circumstances. In reality (assuming the deposit is not mailed late on a Saturday, or during a bank holiday), it normally takes less than 1 day to reach us, and we credit the relevant account shortly after receipt (within 1 hour, usually sooner).

It's very legit, we just have low liquidity, though we do get used, people (for understandable reasons) who are after large amounts of bitcoin prefer to use the more liquid exchanges.
If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to email me via Joeld
We do not accept ukash, you can deposit wire transfers via OKPAY(requires standard verification), or hard currency through Royal Mail (any mail service works, but Royal Mail offers the coverage (and delivery recording!) which we highly recommend, we can't be held liable if you are just mailing hard cash with no cover and it disappears, it also does **not** go through royal mails special delivery that way). 
Direct deposits (Royal Mail) do not require identification (though please keep in mind we track initial input/output of Crypto transactions). Hard currency withdrawal only requires your bank information for depositing into.
We've been around since late 2013, were the 1st UK exchange up and running after mtgox and intersango stopped running. Had our ups and downs (UK bankscough), but we're still here and serving customers that need us.
(I also write for CCN, CryptoCoinNews, occasionally get involved with HM Treasury, used to hold meetups, and involved in some other related projects, and lookout for future interesting articles on BM.)
(0 funds are held on site, and we are anal about security, no crypto will be stolen from us, even if I get waterboarded ;))
Edit: Extra info on the anonymous nature of our services - hard currency deposits only require you to register an email address (any email address). You can buy your crypto, withdraw, send it/spend it (we record initial output).
Withdrawal via hard currency requires your bank info - bank holders name, bank name, account no, sort code. That's all.
Highly recommend to **NOT** shop directly from the IBWT platform, due to our security procedures withdrawal requires admin approval, so is not suitable for the usual 15 minute shopping/transaction. Withdraw to your own wallet, then do your business.

good stuff, expect a call ;)

you also get a lot of constant daily hackers 'testing' your system/platform.. it can be nerve-wracking at first, until you get used to it and then it just becomes part of the norm.

Matt Miller (from bloomberg has been doing a great job for a while.

I wrote about it in a CCN article, and highlighted that 1st article (that people should read it) in 8 more related articles covering candidates.
And I think we are going to find that 79% of the members don't care to vote, and only 1% have actually missed out. But I could be wrong, time will tell.

Brilliant image, sums it up nicely.

zluckdog is correct;


note - **anti-money laundering** and **counter-terrorist**
otherwise it would read "and presents money laundering and terrorist financing risks"

nono, they need to REDUCE the block size, so they can get everyone to LN
then EVERYONE(blockstream) profits!
300kb block limit please! 1mb is FAR TOO BIG, no one will be able to run home nodes by the end of the year! Haven't you seen how expensive SSD's are now! 
i mean, if a year storage for my full node costs less than 2 transactions a year, then clearly something is broken!
300kb now!
