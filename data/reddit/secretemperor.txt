The people commonly referred to as "Bitcoin developers" manage and develop the reference client, not Bitcoin as a whole. They cannot force changes upon everyone.
Let's say, for example, that the Bitcoin developers have decided that as a reward for them developing the client they should receive 1% of every transaction. They could indeed make that change to bitcoin-qt.
This change would only be effective in the reference client, however, not in others, which effectively allows Bitcoin users (especially miners) to "vote" for or against changes. In my example, virtually every Bitcoin user would disagree with this change, so they would simply stop using the client produced by the Bitcoin developers and move on to another client.
In addition, because bitcoin-qt is open source and governed by a free software license, someone else could pick up where the Bitcoin developers left off and continue maintaining bitcoin-qt without the changes imposed by the original developers.
That being said, the Bitcoin developers of course have a lot of influence over the direction of Bitcoin through the reference client.

If a single entity were indeed to gain that much computing power in the Bitcoin network, trust in Bitcoin as a currency would be shaken and its price would likely plummet.
You can generally expect people to behave in their best interest. Miners are invested in Bitcoin, so it is in their own interest not to mine with a pool that's growing this large and prevent this scenario from occurring.
Already you can see computing power moving away from GHash.IO, its share having dropped to 39% in the last few hours.

1. Prepaid cards generally also have a chargeback function, whereas Bitcoin transactions are irreversible.

Mining blocks is a matter of probability. In theory it is possible to do the hash calculation using a calculator (with an effective hashrate of, say, 6 hashes per hour) and still mine a block.
There is no arbitrary limit in hashrate at which mining blocks is suddenly possible. Increasing the hashrate merely increases the probability of that happening.

The length of a blockchain is defined as the total combined difficulty of all blocks, not the number of blocks. So even if an attacker were to fork the blockchain using an artificially low difficulty, he'd still need more than 50% of the network's computing power to catch up with and surpass the rest of the network's blockchain.
Also, merging two blockchains is not possible, as every block can only have one predecessor.

As long as Bitcoin itself has value, there will be an incentive to mine.
If you expect every participant (miner) to act in his or her best interests, then you can expect a miner to eventually turn off his device if it isn't profitable any more. If the network's hashrate decreases significantly, the difficulty will also decrease, which in turn makes mining easier and profitable again.

That depends on what you consider "mining of Bitcoins". At some point in the future the maximum amount of bitcoins—roughly 21 million—will have been generated and no further bitcoins will come into existence.
The work that miner's are currently doing will still be necessary, however it won't be incentivized by new bitcoins being generated but rather by transaction fees.
In other words: In the future, miners won't mine new bitcoins, they'll only mine the transaction fees.

I see. That makes a lot of sense and seems worth looking into.




Banks slapping huge spreads onto currency exchange rates does *not* happen regardless of the exchange method, it happens when using a bank to make the exchange. The true cost of exchanging currencies, i.e. the interbank spread, is minimal.
Also, foreign exchange rates are not "inherently baked into the BTC price", they are dependent on whatever market (i.e. exchange) we're trading in. As such they vary and it is possible to achieve good conversion rates.


That may all be true, but it's also irrelevant to my argument and doesn't contradict anything I've said. I am not claiming that using Bitcoin to exchange AUD for USD is best option in this specific case. I'm not even claiming that it's necessarily the cheapest in general.
In your [earlier post]( you claimed that a regular SWIFT transfer using one's bank would only incur only a small flat fee, which implies that it's a cheap method of exchanging currencies. You also implied that Bitcoin is not useful for exchanging currencies cheaply in [this post](
These are the two hypotheses I am arguing against.
 Example: converting 1000 EUR to USD using Mt.Gox


The current mid price for the EURUSD is 1.37896. I think we can both agree that this is the closest we'll come to the fair or "true" price of the EURUSD.
The Mt.Gox BTCEUR ask price is 808.12708 and the BTCUSD bid price is 575.00000. These values were retrieved within a few milliseconds at 15:10 UTC using the Mt.Gox API.
At most, Mt. Gox's [fee schedule]( specifies a fee of 0.6% per transaction.
In this example, we will convert 1000 EUR into USD. If we buy BTCEUR we are left with 1.72869565 BTC after Mt.Gox takes its cut. Now we sell our 1.72869565 BTC and receive 1388.62 USD after Mt.Gox takes its cut again.
In this example we've even beaten the mid market rate, which would have left us with 1378.96 USD.
Obviously this isn't possible every time. We might have to use two different Bitcoin exchanges to make the conversion and we might incur higher costs due to differing spread/rates among them. The market might also move against us while our Bitcoin transaction between the exchanges is processed.
Nevertheless I've shown that it is possible and quite feasible to use Bitcoin to convert between two other currencies. Oftentimes it is possible to come very close to the mid market rate—or even beat it if we're lucky, as in our case—by using Bitcoin's fast transaction times and the favourable fee structure that most exchanges offer.
I am certain that there are other methods which carry less risk and are equally cheap, but once again, that is not what I am arguing against.

If an attacker were to gain more than 50% of the network's total computing power, they could reverse any transaction and they could prevent transactions from being processed at will.

Everyone can reject them simply by not using the software, but the miners arguably have the most control.
In my example from above, the miners agreeing with the change would stop processing transactions that did not divert the 1% fee to the Bitcoin developers. All other miners would proceed to process transactions as they currently do.
Bitcoin users that disagree with the change and switched to another client would still be able to make transactions without the 1% developer fee that would be processed by those miners that refused to use the Bitcoin developer's update.
In this case the miners that **do** use the modified client applying the 1% fee are incentivized to switch clients, too, as they miss out on transactions and therefore transaction fees otherwise.


I'm not sure what you mean by this.


In most cases that's not a problem as different revisions or versions are usually compatible. In the rare cases that they aren't, a hard fork occurs, which means that two or more parts of the network continue adding to independent blockchains. An example of this was the [hard fork in March 2013](

1. You can sign a message with your address containing the necessary funds. The merchant can then verify that you indeed have control over the funds at this address.
2. Nothing, really, except availability of hardware.
3. If your transaction isn't included in a block within a certain time frame, it will be dropped. This usually will only happen if a transaction is both very small *and* sent without a transaction fee.
4. I think Bitcoin has already gained significant adoption considering how young it is.

When Coinbase played their "high risk" trick on me I immediately contacted their support. At that point, three days had already passed since Coinbase successfully withdrew the funds from my bank account. Coinbase support didn't care.
I argued that other customers in the same situation had their order completed on request. Coinbase support didn't care.
I even referenced a post by a Coinbase representative on the Bitcoin forums in which said representative claims that Coinbase honors the original order if customers contact their support. Coinbase support didn't care.

A hardware wallet doesn't offer more functionality than an app running on a phone such as Mycelium.
The advantage lies in a smaller attack surface. Because the hardware wallet only has one single purpose and no other software running on it—as is the case with an Android phone, for example—there are less possible weaknesses to be exploited.
For this reason a hardware wallet is potentially more secure than a wallet running on a general purpose phone or computer.

First of all you'll want to stop using the HDD immediately. Turn off your computer. Don't even shut down—just pull the plug.
Then, you will want to either boot the computer from a live USB disk running Linux or mount the HDD from a different computer. The important thing here is that you do not write to the disk anymore.
Now you can use a program such as PhotoRec or keyhunter to try to restore your wallet file. This is assuming that your wallet file was not encrypted. If it was indeed encrypted it will have become unlikely if not impossible to recover your wallet since the encrypted wallet is very difficult to distinguish from random noise.
Even if your wallet file wasn't encrypted, a variety of factors determine whether or not it can be recovered. Essentially it boils down to having a little luck.

I'm aware of the statement, but I do not understand what part in particular you believe was a lie.
Andresen doesn't claim that "it's all Gox's fault". He acknowledges that this bug exists in Bitcoin itself and needs to be fixed. It is also true that Mt.Gox could have prevented transaction malleability from affecting them if they had implemented better software.
Perhaps you misunderstand why the community is primarily angry with Mt.Gox. It is not because they fell victim to transaction malleability. As we now know, other sites were affected as well. The community is angry with Mt.Gox because they tried to present this issue as if it is a new and unknown bug when in reality it is well documented.

didn't say that selling 300 coins wouldn't have *any* effect on the market, he said that a sale of that size wouldn't cause such a large dip, which is correct.
Using Bitstamp's order book, a market order to sell $500000 worth of bitcoins right now would cost about 627 bitcoins and would take the last price down to 789 USD/BTC from its current price of, 807 USD/BTC. An 18 dollar drop in price is hardly comparable to the drop shown in the graph that linked.
In our calculation we're disregarding other exchanges, which add more liquidity, so in reality the effects of such a sale are even less pronounced.

Reddit does warn you if you are trying to submit a previously posted link, but the two URLs must have a precise match for that to work. Even a miniscule change, such as changing the protocol to `https` or adding an extra `/` to the end of the link (which is usually inconsequential), will prevent Reddit from catching the duplicate.
I think that Reddit can use some improvement in this regard. For the time being, a good way to find duplicates is using the `url` search parameter.

@_date: 2014-01-01 19:12:57


Fair point. Why would you want to use the most expensive option available as often as possible, though? Most exchanges—including Mt.Gox, to stick with my example—support deposits via SEPA transactions. At Mt.Gox this would cost us another 2.50 EUR at most, which is 0.25 % of our initial deposit.
It seems that Mt.Gox supports withdrawals to US bank accounts only through wire transfers, so we'd indeed have to pay for one wire transfer. Even if we disregard the bank's spread, we are *still* paying less for the conversion.


You seem to be missing the point: Wire transfers themselves usually incur a flat fee. Given a large enough transaction volume the fee for the wire transfer becomes negligible. What really eats at our money is the bank applying their exaggerated spread—which you still haven't addressed—to the single wire transfer that you propose.






That is completely beside the point. I used Mt.Gox as an example because it is the oldest and most prominent Bitcoin exchange. Use a different exchange that offers similarly low transaction fees and the same concept I outlined applies.
The example I gave remains an example and is obviously simplified and somewhat idealized. That doesn't mean that what it exemplifies isn't valid. I have used Bitcoin in the past to cheaply and quickly move money from USD to EUR denominated bank accounts and vice versa.


This is nothing but a straw man argument. I never mentioned Coinbase. At this point you're just putting words into my mouth rather than answering the arguments I make.


I already addressed this. Read my previous comment again.


Most Bitcoin transactions of sufficient size can be sent without fees and still be reliably included in the next block. See [this relevant article]( on the Bitcoin wiki for more information.
Even if a transaction fee was needed, it would most likely be so low that it becomes negligible.

Beating your competitors—most notably Newegg—to Bitcoin adoption was obviously a great move for your company. However, this partnership with Butterfly Labs will undoubtedly be damaging to TigerDirect.
The people in this thread calling BFL a scam are not exaggerating. Outright lies regarding delivery times ("two weeks!") and products being "in stock" and "shipping immediately" are just one part of what makes it such a horrible company.
In my case, Butterfly Labs sold me a miner that couldn't be imported into my country and then ignored any attempts at communication for months up until this day. See for yourself [my thread]( in their support forums.
Granted, my situation is somewhat unique, but there are dozens of customers complaining in the customer service section of BFL's forum about their miners breaking, for example, and BFL subsequently outright ignoring any complaints.
How will it reflect upon TigerDirect when the hardware you sold breaks and your customers cannot get any assistance whatsoever from the manufacturer?

I read your title.


If you only show the worth of the Bitcoin holdings in the local currency, you are hiding the amount of bitcoins held. In other words, you indeed "obfuscate the amount of bitcoins someone has".
My original argument still stands: If someone cannot understand something as basic as divisibility they should either not be converting their currency at all or should be seeking help from someone that does understand. This applies to "normal" people.
It is indeed convenient to show—in addition to the amount of bitcoins held—the current market value of Bitcoin holdings in a local currency that is less volatile. Blockchain.info, Electrum and Coinbase all do this, just to name a few examples. Hiding the number of bitcoins owned has no perceivable advantage.
If Bitcoin achieves mass adoption it will be because of its merits, not because it is dumbed down to the lowest common denominator.

Banks operate to make a profit. Even if is with an awesome bank, that bank will still make money off of currency exchanges and will apply a spread that is many times higher than the one the bank itself is subjected to.


Not exchanging currencies doesn't decrease the cost of currency conversion, it only delays its occurence, as you've noted yourself. As such I don't understand why you've even suggested it.


The interbank spread for AUDUSD was 0.00016 AUD today. This spread is in no way comparable to the spread banks commonly pass on to their customers. Sure, the Bitcoin exchanges involved also want to make a profit and will charge their fees, but there's a good chance that it'll still be cheaper than using a bank.


Although Bitcoin is not specifically intended as a means to exchange other currencies, it can nevertheless be used to do so comparatively cheaply. As such it is useful in this context. How is this a "magical unicorn property"?

Addresses do not expire.
It is not inherently unsafe to reuse an address, but as all transactions are available publicly in the blockchain it would make tracking you very easy. New addresses are commonly created to hide one's tracks and for convenience.
There are nevertheless cases in which one would conceivably use the same address for a very long period of time, e.g. to accept donations.

It can be hard gaining trust there initially, especially when one only has reversible payment methods available.
There are a few sellers willing to sell to unrated traders, even using PayPal and the like. They usually demand a premium to account for the added risk, of course, but it can help to get a foot in the door. Once you have the first few ratings under your belt finding willing counterparties becomes easier.

That is precious coming in defence of an application built around an altcoin that is apparently violating an open source licence.
On a serious note, your reasoning is flawed:
1. Whether or not GetGems makes their source code available when they release their application is legally not up to them if they forked a GPLv3 project without any licencing agreement. Either they make their source code available or they don't release their fork at all.
2. Trademarks are not affected by open-sourcing an application. Just because Mozilla Firefox is open source, for example, doesn't mean that anyone can fork it, build their own product on top of it and then distribute it using the Mozilla Firefox brand.
TL;DR GetGems violating the GPL is illegal, unethical and unprofessional.
@_date: 2015-07-28 06:08:57


First of all, that's completely irrelevant to whether or not you need to release the source code. Did you use GPL code in GetGems without a separate licencing agreement with copyright holders? If the answer is **yes**, **you need to release your code**. If you don't release the source code, you are in **violation of the GPL**.
Second, don't you think you should have done that quality assurance and security analysis **before** releasing your application on the app store(s)?
From your listing in the Google Play Store: "Why Use GetGems? Simple, Secure, Rewarding." Except that you don't actually know if it's secure?

Coinbase is shady for cancelling orders at the last possible second after they've held on to your money for several days, rather than cancelling them immediately or in a timely manner, when they detect "high risk" and hiding behind their bullshit "risk detection algorithm" as if said algorithm somehow excuses them from responsibility for the mistakes it makes.

From the FAQ (which is stickied—you should have read it!):






While I don't necessarily think that you shouldn't at least consider financial advice from the Internet, this subreddit is probably not the best place to get it in regards to Bitcoins. and might be more appropriate subreddits for this question.
That being said, I'll try to answer as many questions from your post as I can.


Actually, if Bitcoin achieves near universal acceptance similar to conventional fiat money, the price of a Bitcoin would need to multiply in order for it to be valued appropriately. Whether or not Bitcoins will be successful in the future cannot be predicted with any certainty, however.


The Bitcoin protocol itself is not specifically designed to enable easy taxation. But then again, neither are banknotes and coins. Nevertheless, concerns about possible government intervention are definitely valid in my opinion.


That implies not investing in anything else, which is definitely a bad idea. It might be a good idea to purchase *some* Bitcoins as part of a diversified investment portfolio, however. I again refer to and as you'll probably receive more in-depth advice there.

Of course it is possible that there is a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol that noone has noticed yet. However, it very unlikely. The Bitcoin protocol and the source code are open for everyone to see and a couple of hundred eyes see more than two. If there is in fact an exploitable flaw then it can be found and abused by anyone, not just the initial creator of Bitcoin.


There are several alternative coins ("altcoins") based on Bitcoin that do not really try to be a currency at all, but offer other benefits, such as [Namecoin](
Again other coins try to be a currency and offer improvements to Bitcoin, such as Zerocoin. One way to think of these altcoins is as testing grounds for improvements that can later be implemented in Bitcoin.
Many of the altcoins offer little to no benefit or even difference to Bitcoin and as a result are perceived to be no more than pump and dump schemes.
That being said, it is completely plausible that a better cryptocurrency could surpass Bitcoin.


[Blockchain.info]( offers several valuable [charts]( and [statistics]( on the Bitcoin blockchain itself.
[Mt.Gox]( used to be considered to be the "standard" exchange and was very influential to Bitcoin's price on other exchanges as well. With Mt.Gox's recent liquidity problems in the US, Bitstamp seems to have relieved Mt.Gox of that function in most circles. [Bitcoinity]( offers an overview of the Bitcoin price on several different markets and in relation to several fiat currencies.

While the possibility is not 0, it is very unlikely that you will ever find a single block. On average, it would take you nearly 19,000 years to mine a block at that hashrate.
Think of it as a giant lottery: Approximately every ten minutes a new winning ticket gets picked (block gets mined). However, some people have more tickets than others (greater hashrate). This means that while theoretically the chance of your ticket being picked is not 0, it is still very unlikely that you will win if someone else that owns an ASIC, for example, has a million times the tickets you have.

I didn't tell to use the search function to be a dick and I'm not angry at him. I realize that with all the attention Bitcoin is getting many inexperienced people will end up in this subreddit looking for answers and I don't want to discourage anyone from asking questions.
However, this question has been asked and answered many times before in many places. As I mentioned in my earlier post, it was incredibly easy and quick to find the answer to this specific question. So when I see it asked again I immediately assume that one of the two applies to the person asking the question:
* is too lazy to search for answers and wants someone else to do it for them
* doesn't know how to search for answers on his/her own
I'm willing to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and therefore assume the latter, which is why try to point them in the right direction instead of silently downvoting and ignoring them.
I believe that someone who spends his own time researching an issue before expecting others to spend their time will ultimately become a more valuable member of the community.

I understand that with the growing attention Bitcoin receives in the media many people are finding their way to this subreddit while they try to figure out what to make of Bitcoin. These people are from all walks of life and oftentimes aren't as familiar with Internet etiquette as the average redditor. But the ability to sign up to this site and submit new posts implies an ability to read and use the search function. Therefore conforming with standard Internet etiquette and this subreddit's rules can be expected of everyone posting here—even of the proverbial "average joe".




On this I strongly disagree with you. is a forum to discuss newsworthy events, find answers and advice regarding more complex issues and explore new ideas, all in the context of Bitcoin. It is not this subreddit's responsibility to answer the same questions over and over again like a broken record. People that are so lazy they would rather waste the time of others than put even a miniscule amount of effort into research do not involve themselves by definition, but I that's just semantics and I do understand the point you are making. By posting the same already answered questions again and again and other noise, these people do not contribute to this subreddit in any way. And while it may be true that Bitcoin as a currency requires the general population's support to succeed, as a subreddit does not.


The majority does usually downvote noise, but usually it will still receive an answer. If noone reprimands them then the posters may be led to believe that their behaviour is acceptable. Referring them to the rules while refusing to answer the question does not address their issue, but if it is not done then they are likely to submit similar posts in the future.

The close of a candlestick represents the last price at which a security actually changed owners in the given period of time. Similarly, the open of a candlestick represents the first price in a given period of time at which a security changed hands.
Due to the bid/ask spread, two consecutive last prices can differ significantly, which in turn leads to the gap between closing and opening price of two consecutive candles.

First off I admit that my original comment is off-topic and probably shouldn't have received the upvotes that it did. It's just the first thing that came to my mind when I read the title of this thread.
I am all for people wanting to learn about Bitcoin and I am not trying to debate the usefulness of this thread. I don't believe not being knowledgeable on a subject like Bitcoin equates to being a moron either. I respect everyone that tries to learn.
However, many people asking questions in clearly did not put any effort whatsoever into finding an answer themselves. Their question could be easily answered either by reading the information in the sidebar and the stickied post or by a quick search of the subreddit, which I consider common courtesy before posting. By posting anyways these people show me that they are lazy and/or inconsiderate and don't value the time of the people trying to help them, and *these* are the people that I consider morons, undeserving of any answer.
The questions in [comment]( are exemplary of this and can actually be found in often, minus the sarcasm of course.

Every time something is written to your hard drive (that includes changes to files), there is a chance the data you are trying to recover, i.e. your wallet file, is being overwritten. Merely booting your computer from that hard drive already writes data to your hard drive, even if it isn't much.
Running the recovery program from a computer that boots from an independent hard drive minimizes the chance of your wallet file being accidentally overwritten—if it isn't already too late that is.
I suppose another solution would be to boot your PC from a CD or USB drive. I apologize for not thinking of that earlier.

Note that the number of confirmations until a transaction counts as "confirmed" is arbitrarily defined by the "original" Bitcoin client (bitcoin-qt). The protocol itself does not afford transactions any special status once they receive six confirmations.

While might be very harsh about expressing his opinion, he is absolutely right in nearly all of these cases.
Not understanding Bitcoin is not a problem. Being too lazy to spend one's own time doing research or at the very least reading the stickied post, which is highlighted and actually says "Newcomers please read" is a problem.
Posting articles that are relevant to Bitcoin—even if only tangentially related—is not a problem. Posting the same article that has already been posted multiple times in the past days—oftentimes with a slightly modified link or wrapped in a blog post that adds absolutely nothing of value to the original article—is a problem.

I believe I may have misunderstood your post, although in my defense it's very easy to do the way it's written.
You are correct in that the underlying protocol can be used for much more than just a currency and is therefore somewhat distinguished from Bitcoin as a currency. Because it was designed with a currency in mind and for lack of another name we still call it the "Bitcoin protocol".
This seems to be a non-issue in this case and other cases, too. Take HTTP, for example, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It has kept its name throughout the years, even though it can be—and is—used for much more than just transmitting linked text.

Either way, I feel like a clarification is necessary: Either clarify and enforce the current rules or change them to reflect this subreddit's new direction.

It is true that a Bitcoin currently can only be divided down to eight decimal points. However, if it should become necessary, the protocol could be changed to allow an even greater divisibility.

Coinbase locks in the exchange rate the moment you make the purchase. Subsequent rising or falling of the price should not influence the amount of bitcoins you receive in any way.

That depends on what you mean by "profit".
Bitcoin offers many advantages over the current systems that are used to transfer money online. So one could argue that everyone will profit from Bitcoin simply by using it and benefiting from lower fees, faster execution times etc.
If on the other hand you mean profiting off the increasing price of Bitcoin, then the answer is no. As with any other investment, some people have made a lot of money from it. But every time a someone sells bitcoins, someone else is buying them at that price. No matter what the price does after that—assuming it does something at all, which it usually does—, one of the two wins and one of the two loses. It is (almost) a zero-sum game.
It is not certain that the price of Bitcoin will keep rising, however, neither in the short-term nor in the long-term. Bitcoin can be a valuable part of a diverse portfolio of savings, but it's hardly suitable as one's sole investment.

Using the developer's public key the signature, which was created with the developer's private key, can be verified.
To be certain that the developer's public key actually belongs to him, you need to rely on the web of trust. If you are not familiar with the concept, read [this Wikipedia article]( and the GnuPG [handbook](
Ideally you would have a connection to the developer somehow, i.e. you trust someone that trusts someone that trusts the developer's key actually belongs to him. In practice, unless you're well connected in the open-source world or other communities that rely on OpenPGP, you probably will not have that connection, and you can only be certain of the key's authenticity up to a certain—but usually sufficient—degree.
For example, if the developer's key is signed by several other developers of known software projects then it is reasonable to assume that the key in question is legitimate, since it is unlikely that all of the developers would become compromised at once.

Would you mind posting the transaction? The worst someone could do with it is actually get it out to the network, which you seem to want anyways.

I understand that memes, panic posts and the like are not explicitly forbidden. They do not contribute to this subreddit's stated purpose, however. Given that they seem to make up a growing share of new submissions it might be appropriate to consider changing the rules.

* donation address contains zero transactions, implying that the site is just as young as * WaterAid's official site makes no mention of accepting Bitcoin and there is no mention of it on any news site either

As long as the twelve words are less than 128 ASCII characters long (including spaces) you can.
Typically Electrum seeds will fall within this limit. For example, I just generated a dozen new Electrum seeds and they were all less than 90 bytes long.

I am not a moderator in this subreddit, but based on past experience a post will be removed if it has any referral link in it at all.

bitcoin-qt automatically creates a pool of private keys by default. You should see at least one address in the "Receive" tab. If you don't, simply click "New Address".
If you close bitcoin-qt while it is still updating the blockchain it will resume updating the next time you start it. Since a new block is found approximately every 10 minutes, having to sync after bitcoin-qt has been closed for a while is normal.

Integration with social networking sites is only useful when there is an interest in sharing something consistently and automatically.
For example, my "friends" on Facebook are able to view a collection of the music I enjoy. This connec In this case my music client's integration with Facebook has merit because I am comfortable with sharing all the music I listen to. My music client does not require my approval every time I listen to a new song.
If a user does not want to share **all** Bitcoin transactions on Facebook and instead wants to choose the transactions to share selectively, then the integration becomes pointless. Offering a button that will post something to Facebook or Twitter offers little advantage over the user simply writing about the transaction on said sites. I imagine most users will fall into this category, i.e. they do not want to consistently share what they do with their money.
In addition I see potential problems from a programmer's perspective: How is the software to know for what purpose a transaction was made. How does it even know to *where* a transaction was made for this matter? I prefer the developers spend their time improving the Bitcoin protocol and the clients' usability rather than worrying about comparatively unimportant issues at this point in time.
Last but not least, introducing more code also potentially introduces new bugs and security vulnerabilities.
