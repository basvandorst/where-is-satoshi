You realize that day trading harms the network and Bitcoin generally, right?

My old (2-year old that is) prediction was that if it could hit 10k by 2020 and 100k by 2030, I might be able to retire with it at 1M by 2040. 
But then again, my training is as a live sound technician, not a financial psychic, so I'm not surprised my prediciton was bad.

No no, it's just a shit app that doesn't lock on to GPS very well.  I have had this problem from the start with my Nexus 4.  And since they make bug reporting quite annoying and difficult due to horrible website design, I don't know if they even know this is an issue.

Now, as a current user in Toronto, are you going to fix it so that I can actually log-in to get my "winnings" out of your system?  I can't log in with what I know is the proper password and when I use the "forgot password" link it tells me "Sorry, we have a problem trying to recover your password. Try again later!." as it always has since I first told you guys that you needed to add a "forgot password" link to your login.

Ya, I have lost pretty much all trust in these people as far as their intended product goes.  They are asking people to donate bitcoins to let people "find and own" their own coins, but then don't allow you to withdraw them. While I do wish I had complete trust in every person on the planet, their lack of communication and the closed nature of this software screams "DO NOT TRUST" to me.

And for your cake day, here are the commands I ran:






though you may want to put the folder in /mnt/cache/appdata instead if you don't want a share called 'bitcoin'

I just found this one that I'm setting up on my unraid box.

Ya, it kills me how these companies are making centralized, controlled systems based on what is supposed to be decentralized and free. But that's just crazy I guess. Thanks for the work. This looks like awesome potential.

No, it's a coinbase thing. They can't do Canadian currencies, and it won't allow me to use USD or EUR wallets. I guess it's a FIAT thing.
EDIT: So, I am not allowed to to Buy or Sell orders on Coinbase as a Canadian too. I guess they want to be the place that I buy and store my BTC, but not trade. I have access to Kraken, but I'd bet the API is too different to make it work with them, since I am not at all a programmer. (I know, I am just curmudgeonly complaining now.)

Damn. I just noticed that as a Canadian I can't have a USD/EUR wallet. BOo-urns. This sounded really interesting.
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:51:04
Can I start out with BTC instead of EUR/USD? The trades start using BTC and sell when it's X% over the initial buy amount (Manually set).
Also, is the buy order an infinite loop of buys/sells? IE, when you enter:


Does it automatically restart the buy process if when the price hits 1000 again after selling at 110?
EDIT: For clarification of my stupid.

That's the point of the KDBX file. It's an encrypted file format, so even IF the rar password is brute forced, the file that actually holds the keys are still encrypted.

I got through that part and just had to laugh at the fact that the world owes more money to the world than the world has. Something can't be right about that. I know it is, but it just don't seem right.
