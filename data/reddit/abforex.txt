seriously though, with how high it is now I am super scared to buy.  I feel like I missed my opportunity.

Honestly, I am scared it is going to tank 50% and never come back. 
I know I probably should just man up and buy it.  I was curious though if there are better ones to buy now.

Thank you for the advice.
Do you recommend spreading money around to several different coins to diversify?
Say I only have $2k to invest, how would you split that money up?

There was a clear trend in his video, bit coin sky rockets, retraces, sky rockets, retraces, sky rockets.  So, yeah bitcoin might correct 30-50% before sky rocketing again. But it certainly is not going to go to $0 at this point. 
I was on another site where some dip shit was asking if he should be buying into crypto currencies.   
Of course you should be buying crypto currencies.  Bitcoin, Etherum, Ripple, Lite Coin.  Buy as much and as many different ones as you can.  Even if one of them goes bust, you are still going to profit massively off the rest over time.

Yeah, that is how I feel.  I think I will just get f'ed if I buy now.  Are there better cryptos to buy?

were you awake during that dip?  
Did you consider getting out when it bounced back up?

How high do you think it will go?
I didn't think it was high when it was around $300.  I just felt that the brokers offering it were scammers.  I come from trading Forex where scams happen frequently. Back in the day you would deposit money with a broker and they would straight up steel your money.  After what happened with Mt. Gox I got turned off from it until this summer.  By then it was already so high.
