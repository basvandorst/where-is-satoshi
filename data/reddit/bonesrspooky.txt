I own a bitcoin ATM, so I’m pretty knowledgeable about the space. Anyways, just open up coinatmradar and it’ll tell you the capabilities of the machines in your area.
Operators are reluctant to offer selling for a few reasons. One being that the machines that offer it cost more. Only about 20 percent of transactions are sell transactions on those machines. It also requires way more liquidity to offer both sides. Finally, it requires more risk and/or more network transactions.

This is why my ATMs are buy-only. Nobody wants to wait for multiple confirmations, and it just eats up more liquidity as cash (admittedly a bill recycler helps).

They don’t buy any bitcoin. They simply facilitate the sale of bitcoin between two other parties and take a cut as fees.
When you buy off of Coinbase, it probably just takes some liquidity from Coinbase Pro (at wayyy higher fees - seriously, just use Coinbase Pro). 
Without people offering to buy or sell at any given price, there would be no bitcoin sales and no fees to them. That’s why they incentivize you to offer a certain price as a market maker with 0% fees in Coinbase Pro. Some exchanges even give you a NEGATIVE fee rebate for adding liquidity to their books.

Yeah, but it shouldn’t take DAYS to clear a wire transfer. Domestic Fedwire funds are available INSTANTLY when they leave the wire room. Note that Coinbase Pro credits most of my wires in about 2 hours. 
Kraken’s “funding partner” needs to get their act together.

That’s international (SWIFT probably) and that’s to be expected.  Sending from the US to Evolve bank, who services regular Kraken deposits now (also in the US), should take hours. Tops. 
If you’re servicing a commodity industry that has +/- 20% days, you better bet that people want to move in and out quickly.

It’s currently in the food court of a popular shopping mall. 
I registered as a business with my state.  I also registered with FINCEN and the BSA on the federal level (which is free to do). I’ll make the leap to LLC before I add more machines. 
On that note, you’ll need to know your state’s money transmitter laws very well - you’ll be tiptoeing through them carefully and you don’t want to be on the wrong end of the law.

My machine only supports buying,.
I average about 6 transactions a week. There’s basically two kinds of customers. Those that spend like 20 bucks just for the novelty and those that spend 500-2500 dollars per transaction. I’d say it’s about half and half between these customers. 
It’s not like a cash atm where you make a whole bunch of small transactions consistently, it’s all about feast and famine.

It managed to be more underwhelming than my worst case scenario. Which is impressive in its own right.

Thanks for the tips, it helps a lot.

I've been running a bitcoin ATM in a shopping mall for a few months now. I'm happy to answer questions, let me know.
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:10:15
I'm buying my first one this month. Fire away with questions.

If you're willing to lose a little bit in spread, a bitcoin ATM is a convenient and safe way to sell off this amount for nearly instant cash.

I'm starting with the GeneralBytes BATMTwo. My initial offer to a gas station will be 1% gross/month, but I'm willing to go much higher for the shopping mall. I'm a little scared of fixed rent without having any data of my own.

Well, I'm in the midwest. I thought things were going well in negotiations with a local university to put it in the student center (this has to be the holy grail location!)  but their lawyer kept INSISTING that I was somehow infringing on PNC's exclusive banking rights. I'm now in discussions with a shopping mall, but if that falls through, there's a million gas stations around this university that should be no problem getting into. There's a month lead time to delivery so I'm not super concerned. I'm putting an 11.5% spread on the price, the same as my only competitor. With very conservative estimates way less than CoinATMradar predicts, I would net $600/month after all expenses. I am buying the machine cash and am using leverage to acquire bitcoin liquidity at 0% interest. Here's a nice calculator if you're interested:

Not Illinois, but there are some CoinFlips in other parts of my state. PNC bank is roughly everywhere. I’m curious if that would affect me putting them in Sheetz stores...

If you go with general bytes, which is the cheapest, you can get one shipped with a stand for like $3,750. After that, you need $3k+ in liquidity depending on total monthly sales and number of machines (minimum $3k per machine I’d say and that’s if you’re okay with constant bank runs.)
Good chance you’ll need a deposit for your space rental, mine was $500.
Insurance was only like $100 for a year and every other random cost comes out to less than $100 per month together. 
Anyways, I’d say it’s around $7.5k in fixed costs (including tied up liquidity) to get your first one rolling. Then you have recurring fixed costs like rent and wireless hotspot plus recurring variable costs like server fees, and bank &amp; exchange fees, taxes, and rent commissions.
Every one after the first is much, much easier to get going though.

CoinATMradar has pretty much everything you’ll need to get up to speed. All of their estimated numbers both for costs and revenue are quite a bit higher than what I’ve seen so far, but then again, I wasn’t in business during the massive bull run.
