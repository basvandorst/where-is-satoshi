Actually, the high price for Berkshire Hathaway shares is maintained precisely for this reason: to specify a minimum investment one must make to own shares in the company.

Also no one is day trading Western Union.

The fact USD is your numeraire does not make your balance of it your only asset of value.

I would expect democrats to discuss a lot of things when they don't control either chamber.

If shorting via derivatives like futures or forwards, then yes you are taking either counterparty or exchange risk. If shorting the old fashioned way (borrowing and then selling to buy back later, if this is even possible with BTC) you are taking liquidity/squeeze risk and you have to pay for the borrow. 
TL;DR: shorting isn't free

Point is what Slummers wants to do and what Modi did are not at all the same thing, regardless of what you think about either policy.

Yes, because of a major graft problem. Larry summers wants to ban the $100 bill (permanently) in the U.S. as a step toward a cashless society to in turn make negative interest rates possible.
Two very different policies.

Why don't people understand these are not the same thing?? The two bills banned in India are worth ~7 USD and ~15 USD, and the government is REINTRODUCING the $7 one and adding a $30 one in place of the previous largest denomination. 
India has a massive corruption problem (literally vote buying with cash) that doesn't exist in the US; we save all our corruption for the corporate level so we can pretend it's not corruption. 
Will it push people into the banking system on the margin? Yes, but India has bigger fish to fry at this point.

The fact a financial institution reports something as taxable doesn't make it taxable. You can (and should) dispute the amount of taxable income in your returns, even if Coinbase sends you a 1099. This issue comes up all the time with banks (cough Citi cough) that send 1099s for frequent flyer mileage bonuses associated with checking accounts (arguably not income). You and the institution are both just interpreting the revenue code.

I agree with the latter part of your comment. As to the former: similar, yes, but the balance of problems in India is vastly different from that in the U.S: corruption is an overwhelmingly more dire problem for Indian society relatively speaking than money laundering (Slummers' stated target even though we all know killing the $100 bill is about giving central banks more control of the money supply) is for the U.S.

I love bitcoin, but I doubt it. The investment community revolves around NYC because of inertia- investors and the services they rely on (read: other professionals, not software services) are already here (largely within a 10-block radius to boot). Money-changing and stock trading has long been centered in places other than NYC, but it doesn't matter- the people in the business are largely still located here.

I'm not sure this is a big deal, at least not how OP understands the term. Cash also has similar limitations (and I assume OP believes cash is "fungible" in this sense); e.g. I cannot walk into a bank and deposit $100k in cash without the bank being required to fill out kyc paperwork, can't buy a Ferrari in cash without at a minimum raising some eyebrows, etc.

However nice it may sound, that just isn't true. The govt certainly can and has done just that in the case of banking- if you aren't willing to go through the KYC process, the bank cannot accept your deposit.

As a general rule, the more desperately governments attempt to ban something, the more likely the thing in question is to stick around.
