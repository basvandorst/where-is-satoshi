So most of you seem to not know the normal process when you lose your bank card. VERY FEW institutions will let you go to a branch and get a new card printed out. Some of you are just flat out lying saying that you did that. I have several family members in the banking industry, you can't just go and get a new card on the fly. Some institutions may offer this, but they are locations specific and are not constant across companies or regions.  Usually you can do a withdraw from your account if you can verify your identity, but you don't just get a new debit card on the fly. This does take a few days to do. The few times that it isn't, I'm willing to just say don't count since it is so rare.  Rant over

Ok well agree to disagree. I'll take family advice over strange Reddit people any day. Especially since the work in banks.

That's unique to your bank. Most will not do that. Source.. have lots if family that working in banking industry

Ok well... I know what I have seen and been told so we will agree to disagree. MOST institutions will not issue you a temp card. You can make a withdraw at a location, but usually you can't get a temp card. Average time is 5-10 business days. The few of you that claim otherwise are just having unique experiences. I won't tolerate your belittling attitude of " blah blah blah"

I been in that situation and went to a local branch. They refused and said would take 5-10 business days to get one. That's when I verified with the family that works in banking. Found out that most WILL NOT replace your card on the spot

Ok well not wrong so correcting you there. Again won't tolerate your tone either. "Imaginary" family ? What kinda gay ass remark is that. I stand by what I said. Most institutions will not just give you a new card on site. Can argue all you want but I know how this works. Anyway I'm probably just going to g to end this conversation. We will just have to agree to disagree

Well will keep correcting you for being wrong. Not a "anti-vaxer". Another gay ass statement. Nope most institutions will not offer temp cards. Very few do. Won't tolerate the continue family bashing. Checked again yep they all said the same thing. Very few institutions will issue temp cards. I'll take their word over a condescending internet kiddo any day. Anyway just agree to disagree or this conversation will continue. I won't tolerate a smart ass kid.

Actually I was so correcting you for being wrong there.

I don't know. Sometimes I'd rather just lose the money on principal. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:20:53
Yeah you did. Anyway conversation is pretty much invalid at this point so I'm ending it. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:10:49
As with most things in life, it isn't what you know, but who you are.

Government wouldn't have gone through all the trouble if they weren't a little bit guilty of something. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 07:12:05
Your analogy failed. We are talking about a stable government, not Nazi Germany.

Hopefully you are kidding.
