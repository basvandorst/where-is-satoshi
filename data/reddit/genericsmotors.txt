Sorry for your loss :(

You remind me of Mord, from Game of Thrones.

Aye, so long as Bitfinex continues to prop up the price using Tethers they print from thin air.
When they're no longer able to do that, the market will capsize and everyone in the game will be left holding bags of dog shit.

**So where are the audits?**

Coinbase hasn't printed almost 1 billion dollars in the last month, not sure why you're using them for comparison.

So this will effectively create "super nodes"...

When a merchant that uses Lightning (are there any that do?) wants to take the days earnings and cash them out for fiat - presumably closing any open channels - this will require transactions on the BTC chain.
Multiply that by however many tens of thousands merchants you'd like to adopt the LN and you're back to a congested network :)

Thanks for taking the time to reply. It will be interesting to see how this works out in practice, under real-world usage.

And it's the venerable Flubber, no less!
As punishment for my heresy I'll go ahead and seppuku myself.

My liege! You grace us with your presence!

Looks like they're going to get a free audit from the USG. Good luck, hope you're not holding a bag of tethers.

Guy was probably being an insufferable gobshite prick for the last month, flapping his gums about lambos and the moon when nobody at his office gave a crap.
His tears are delicious.

Shhhhh! You're interrupting the circlejerk

Uhm what?
I was not referring to your comment on why bitcoin will never be widely adopted, I was replying to Maca_Najeznica.
I've updated my comment, in case this wasn't clear.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:24:43
Even if bitcoin could scale to compete with conventional payment methods, which it can't, ~~this comment right here~~ your comment is a good example why it will never be mainstream, and no "normies" will ever give two shits about bitcoin.

Mass adoption, any day now!

You now own useless digital tokens instead of a house...

And now all the kid needs to do is run a full node and make sure its online 24/7, or risk losing his funds on channel closure :)

It doesn't mean anything, he's grasping at straws.

Force? Now you sound like a jackbooted statist. Let the free market decide.

@_date: 2018-07-23 16:04:56


This must mean that mass adoption is imminent

Easy to avoid taxes when you have no income, I guess.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:11:05
Let us know how that works out for you.

I've heard you're fond of quiche. Can you share your favourite recipe?
