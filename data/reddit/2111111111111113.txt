@_date: 2017-11-15 10:50:38
cool thanks
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:43:16
for same reasons that we have internet I guess!? if there are 2 ways for transaction then its better for me)
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:19:02
you can't see?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:03:43
do you mean that I had a lot of small incoming transactions from one address and when I send a added up old transactions that I have received as one bigger transaction that is what made it fast and quiet cheap?
other words if it was a sum of transactions that I previously received from many different addresses then my transaction would take longer? is it what you mean? or not
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:42:09
thats crazy
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:21:31
May be. I never heard of lightning network before. Will check that out

@_date: 2017-11-19 12:03:42
its not faster!
I just sent some bch and already 18 minutes not even one confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:23:07
thats funny
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:23:59
I just sent 0.01502342 btc from one legacy wallet to segwit wallet. it took less 10 minutes to get confirmed. I payed 0.0002btc as fees I think its quite fast and not expansive 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:39:34
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:42:12
ok. thanks, now I understand that its made by renting satellite
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:52:25
thanks! and I didn't know that they come back. I thought they would stay in question forever
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:26:43
For example my blockchain wallet didn't want to send to sw ledger wallet. But ledger wallet sends without any problem sw way to any sw and legacy wallets 
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:23:44
is it posible only for btc? 
what about bch and other alt coins?
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:13:47
I moved once for 1 usd and it took almost 3 days. though another day I sent from same place bigger amount and payed the same 1 usd fee and got confirmed in 1 hour. so I don't understand really how this all works
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:04:54
what will happen in 4 days?
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:48:57
from any)
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:19:54
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:14:08
and where to check how much fees everybody pays?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:13:00
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:04:03
very scary to keep funds on exchanges after stories like that
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:14:31
this I understand
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:58:42
can you tell me how to choose right amount of fee for transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:49:32
I think you will not. but it was interesting if they could do it too or its only bitcoin can make
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:39:08
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:11:46
crash again and later what happens? To the moon. the video is so dumb 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:02:27
a week ago bitcoin cash was slow 15 hours to get confirmed! thats insane! "fast confirmation bch- bullshit"
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:35:24
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:11:20
can't you do something criminal with fiat? so they can knock because you hold fiat?
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:44:05
yeah I know about difficulty change. its going to go down right? 
7.8? maybe! I am willing to by at 8.9-8.0
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:11:02
actually i thought ledger was doing it automatically. so it doesn't apply correct fee? and I am overpaying?
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:09:18
I use ledger nano s. I would like to go as cheap as possible while still being fast.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:48:42
cool ill try using your method! but the site I wrote was still a lot cheaper then just use wallets settings which are enormously high
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:15:30
my confirmations were fast less 15 minutes and I send with low fees intentionally
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:52:54
There are actually a lot of possible ways to get payed without confirmations I think. 
You can use some kind of pre payed service (or app) that you put some amount of btc that will be confirmed in app before you go to restaurant or anywhere else where you want to pay with pre confirmed in app btc's. So you kind of use it same like debit card, where you have to put real money in and then use the card. Same kind of app like those cards and any one can pay and receive immediately funds in app account.
And maybe the system like that already exists so I think confirmation time is something that can be easily fixed and not a problem for bitcoin.
thats my opinion thats what I believe! btc is good as it is.
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:06:43
cool congrats 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:05:19
sounds good!)
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:47:06
now I'm playing with customizing fees. and it really looks like it works if I pul lower fee it still confirms quite fast
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:25:38
I do a lot transactions and pay for them 30-50 cents. if you don't change settings for in your wallet then it can be high!
before I was guessing but some time ago someone told me this site  where you can check and kind of choose how much you want to pay and how long it will take
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:01:50
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:47:10
no that was just a question if others have this option
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:09:27
Nerveus freak!  I think he has a mental problem that he can't manage. that was ugly to watch((
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:39:21
yes thats true!))
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:32:13
yeah so cool wow!
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:14:29
sorry but do you know if its possible to get like that on ledger nano s?  to have 2 seeds in one ledger?
