i bought a ledger nano and i still haven't used it yet... im about to set it up. sorry for your loss man.. that guy will get what's coming to him. watch the blockchain, you can track him down when he tries to cash out. maybe see if he's on an exchange. don't give up man, that's your money. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:05:20
ledger nano is only about 100 usd

this same conversation literally has been happening everyday for the past 5 years on this sub with \~3k of the current price up or down with people saying the price will go up or down, the price is based off how many people are buying or selling, the only way for it to go down if a whale feels like selling 50 million in bitcoin, or someone decides to buy up 50 million in bitcoin, the market cap is 180 billion, there are only 17 million coins out there, you just divide the two to get the current price, there is no "feeling" or anything, it's just whenever people make big ass orders one way or the other

where is coinbase's wallet? they spread it out? bitfinex has a lot in that one wallet, damn man. it's crazy, you are in the top 15% of wealth if you hold more than .1 in your wallet. insane. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:29:18
good.. then i can finally buy some down low
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:31:00
oh i see... yeah weird 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:48:13
interesting, i do see the walls there. that price though seems to be added up from the total amount up the wall, it is not the wall only. it looks like if you hover over before the wall starts, then move the mouse to after the wall, at 19k, it looks like it is a 10 million dollar difference, so someone put up a 10 million dollar wall there, is that accurate? 
when i move the mouse up and down that red line, the total just keeps getting higher, it doesn't seem to show the exact amount for that particular wall, do you know waht i mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:49:21
it's not really shady, there's obvious proof of people buying it at higher prices, what's shady is the exchange turning off and on
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:18:12
i was watching gdax... there was a sell order of like 10 or 20 million at 8,999 that lasted a while, there kept popping up orders to buy it, but the majority of the buy orders were at around 3k or 4k.. there was a ton of money that was ready to be sold, that's why the price was so high
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:52:18
Why is it a big story? I dont understand what that means

Now everyone who complained omg I should have bought it at 10k omg omg omg, now is your chance
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:30:32
the buy order is insane on gdax, the price is going to sky rocket, i was going to transfer money to another wallet on another exchange, but now coinbase is down!!! FUCK

How do u check the sell walls?

Hey man,
Awesome on giving back, that is amazing. I wanted to let you know about another charity. First of all, I'm going to say I'm sorry for even letting you know about it, because honestly this charity has been in the back of my head for a while and I give to them every month, but not much, only what I can afford right now, but this guy is doing god's work. 
First, I know animal welfare is kind of a taboo discussion, but this guy works to help animals in basically the worst positions on Earth. His name is Marc Ching, he goes to China to help dogs and cats that are involved in the dog meat trade. He also helps other animals in other welfare situations in the 3rd world, like labs, or fur factories. Now this is China.. where animal welfare is basically non existent in the laws.. he is working with the government and trying to bring some kind of order to these places. 
I'm going to say also, I am not a vegetarian and I'm not saying eating meat is bad and all of that. However, what is happening in 3rd world countries honestly is kind of unreal, and extremely traumatizing.
In the dog meat trade, animals are literally tortured because it is believed it makes the meat more "tender" or something and therefore more healing. 
When I say torture, I mean like, straight out of a horror movie torture, like boiled alive, skin ripped off alive, burned, gagged, banged on the head. I can't even watch the videos, they make me completely sick to my stomach and it is just a complete travesty of everything humanity stands for. Even the fur trade stuff with foxes, man it is so unreal and so sad on every level, like straight up ripping the skin off before they even are dead. why? :(
Like I said, I'm not vegan or against meat if it's ethical, lbut I mean, to straight up torture animals before death is like, fucking unreal man, unreal
Our boy, made a video about them. Verne, is there anyway you can reply to this post and talk about how this charity impacted you? I know it touched me a lot too, you can see the video he made here where he visited the guy:  
Now, please, if you feel like you might get sick from watching this videos, or can't stand it, I suggest not watching it at all. I literally can not watch them anymore, I felt so bad afterwards, I really mean that, if you like cats or dogs, this is unreal what is going on over there. You can see their facebook here though: 
Anyway, me personally I'm working on business stuff and it is on my list to one day be able to donate as much money as I can to this guy. He never says no to helping animals. He actually brings the animals back to America when he can and gets them adopted here too.
I feel bad even posting this and writing about it. I know it will make other people sick to their stomach, and I feel bad when it is such a negative thing, but I read this post from my phone while I was out before and I knew I had to try to make this post. 
Even if you can't donate a lot, anything would be helpful for this guy, I only give a small amount, wish the impact could be more though.

i just bought a nano ledger myself, it came out to around 100 usd with shipping
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:27:34
ha.. what makes you think it will drop so low?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:05:24
ohhh i get it, so because there are way less sell orders between 20k and 25k, for that reason, it will be going up way higher than from 15k to 20k beause there were so many sell orders holding the price down as people kept selling. 
damn, wish i had like 100k laying around lol 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:49:19
Yeah cuz coinbase doesnt show live orders being bought and sold

What does the wall mean
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:05:01
ok, so it is showing on the graph then? im confused what we are arguing about, you were saying it wasn't, it showed up on gdax so i know it was there, and now you are saying it showed on coinbase, so it was trading at 8.5k ? so we agree? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:37:10

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:05:05
i see... cool, thanks for showing me that. is there anything that shows the historical chart of these? like i wonder what it looked like when the price was jumping up, i see here, to hit 20k, it needs to hit 91 million in purchases.. which seems like a lot, i wonder how realistic that is or not, or this is how it always looks
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:26
it was on the depth chart on gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:32:42

if paper money is so bad, why is bitcoin always worth something in USD, what if inflation happens, the bitcoin changes in its worth, it seems to be dependent on USD
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:14:13
I mean makes sense, except bitcoin is traded in decimal points, also how are you supposed to know many tenths of a bitcoin some thing is worth if you aren't comparing it to USD, it seems like a shortfall to me now when I talk about it like this

you were waiting for this to happen weren't you
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:23:55
yeah totally possible...from my perspective, i look at it long term, i think the price will go up very high once all the 21 million coins are mined, so the swings up and down don't matter as much, because i'm thinking the coins will be pushing 100k when the time comes, so i still buy it no matter what
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:03:27
it goes up when people buy more than sell.. so probably being at the top of reddit is driving people to start buying it

@_date: 2018-06-11 00:58:05
Realistically yea it could... Look at ethereum its now in the 100s, most people got in bitcoin got in at 10k+, all of them lost money, all of them are slowly selling overtime when this isnt making money, it doesnt matter tho, long term it rises

@_date: 2019-04-04 01:18:08
comparing the stock market to crypto as if there is a correlation is not wise.... my point is bitcoin ATH is nearly 20k... for op to post that the price went up and he's pissed off is stupid because you want to invest in mind with it reaching near another ATH... so 1k is not a lot in the grand scheme of investing in crypto if it only went from 4k to 5k... yes it went up 25% today... but the price is so volatile it doesn't matter when it is below 10k... 25% today could be -75% tomorrow, could be 250% the next day.... long term thinking bro...

@_date: 2018-11-25 17:22:23
Huh? The point of dca is to buy at lows and highs over long term. If u think it will drop to 0, then yes you will lose it all,  but that can be said about any investment and is not known
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:21:47
theres only 3 million coins left... and yes, it will be mined far in the future, but it is going to get too difficult to mine in the future... there won't be as many coins being added to market as there is now going into future meaning less inflation... and everything in the economy is impacted by the stock market... i didn't mean literally the stock market does X and then bitcoin does Y, i mean the economy is going to go down, and people will start selling assets because they have no money... people are going to sell their bitcoin if the economy crashes, just like they are going to sell a lot of assets outside of bitcoin if the economy crashes
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:41:28
honestly no one should expect anything for another 10 or 20 years, once all the coins are mined, then something will happen, until then it's up in the air, and probably will have a sharp, sharp fall once the stock market correction comes up pretty soon here

It was satoshi
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:29:51
That's the whole point of dca,  you buy highs and lows,  not just at one price. Bitcoin is a finite asset, there are new coins being added to the market everyday helping to drive the price down with this decreased demand,  this is not the case long term,  dca is a good long term strat if you believe the coin could have good long term value. Although if you don't think that's possible,  i see your point,  but no one knows for sure what will happen when all 21 million coins are on the market. Imo it will increase value over time,  but that is the debate.  ;)

i think bitcoin is going up because the whole bitfinex thing going on.. they lost 850 mil in cash backing tether (which has over 2 billion out, btw), so i think they are having a lot of issues making withdrawl requests, i think a lot of people are buying bitcoin getting out of tether, i think a crash will come if bitfinex's house of cards collapse and they wound up losing a lot of people's money.
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:06:52
