I am verified at tier 3 already. I just want to put USD into my account but unsure if I will get the full amount I request minus the $5 fee. 
For example I deposit $5000 USD, I'm expecting to see $5000 or $4995 (minus $5 fee). I just want reassurance that's what I should expect and not some old number like $4895.88 because of unmentioned currency exchange rate due to international bank wire transfer. I saw some people online mentioning it gets converted. 
Can you recommend a good reliable trading site if Kraken is a POS due to lag.

What do you suggest using? I'm completely new to this, I went with Kraken because my friend used it.

I did and got the email below. Completed the form but still haven't heard anything back yet. I don't understand why simple questions like above can't answered by you and why I have to create a ticket for it. 
I just want to know if whatever about of USD I'm trying to deposit is going to be exchange to another country's currency than changed back to USD, because I read somewhere that it does try that. 
I don't want to take lost on unknown conversion rates that I'm not informed of. 
"Thanks for contacting Kraken. Due to the recent surge in demand for our service, we are transitioning away from clients opening support tickets via email. Please get in touch with us by navigating here instead: 
We're going to close the ticket that's been opened by email and will not respond to it. We're very sorry for the inconvenience this may cause, but we assure you that this will result in faster service.
Our previous process required us to sort client issues that came in via email to the relevant team, and this cost you valuable time."
It's hard to trust my money in a site if they going to be unresponsive or take a long time to resolve an issue.
