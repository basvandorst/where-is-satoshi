I guess the early Bitcoin narrative needed a Laszlo, someone willing to do something eye\-popping in order to catapult the movement. Yes, Satoshi said let there be Bitcoin but I think Laszlo caused the flood and well, the rest is history.

You and me both. I'd like to what he thinks about the present state of bitcoin and crypto/blockchain as a whole. We get to hear every waking thought of Buterin's, it'd be nice to have the same with Nakamoto.

Yes, that's true. Many of them will die. Amazon wasn't the only player in the early dot-com era.

That's the thing with descriptions, they can be a bit subjective. But fair to say that the consensus is that Nakamoto was a bit of an oddball. If I were Nakamoto, I guess I'd be too considering the weight of what I was working on.

Absolutely no clue whatsoever. It's so comical.

I don't think they've even gotten the hang of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-05 08:38:00
I agree

Hahahahahahahahahahaha... You could be on to something there, you know. Just try come up with some revolutionary piece of tech.

Some altcoins are showing great promise. It's all about utility beyond the payment arena. Don't discount of them yet.

Those who cannot do it should shut up when those can do it are doing it... African Proverb.

Interesting angle. I think people tend to project their own values on others and be judgemental even if they don't mean to. It's human nature, I guess.

Perhaps the History Channel should include him/her in their next Alien documentary.

Yes, there will be a massive weeding out of many of these *pardon my language* sh*tcoins. But I think blockchain has the potential to revolutionize certain aspects of human life

I agree with you. I've read the white paper a hundred times and examined the testimonies of other early Bitcoin developers. I think your description is spot\-on. Maybe one day we'll find out who the genius is.
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:14:29
I suspect he/she was. Weird and genius are after all, synonymous.
