Payment with bitcoin was and will be illegal in Russia. This bill says it clearly.

Could someone explain to me is there a possibility lightning network will totally replace blockchain?
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:05:04
Thats why i am asking my question, i would like to be wrong. 
So once again, why would i want to close a lightning channel if everyone around me uses lightning network? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:44:19
Im not anerican, not an expert, i think they would never know until you cash out. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:16:47
But there is no reason to close lightning channel if everyone uses it, therefor less and less tx's are happening on a blockchain.  
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:17:16
I read the bill in its original form. You are limited to $900 and can't use your own wallet w/ keys (only exchange)
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:01:58
Who doesn't?
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:15:35
Could you explain why please?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:54:21
I like the term "year 2011/13/17 Bitcoin bubble". Bitcoin is not a bubble, but it is used as one. So far we had a few of those and this time probably won't be any different. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:10:58
70 billion would be 4 million coins, you sure?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:20:38
Hey guys, i was wondering if there is an exchange where i can trade virtual bitcoins for virtual dollars. Like a simulation, or a game, without real investment or profit. Its interesting how much i would lose/gain on day trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:30:26
Well thats how bcash was created.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:06:57
Then you import it to any wallet software you have installed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:37
Thats how great depression started
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:13:24
After a crash to 7000$ maybe
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:50:18
"Inclined to keep that data private" until they don't. Im more then 100% sure that government can access it if needed, especially one like Russia's or China's. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:43:13
I would cash out in such a way that crypto would be less then 30% of my wealth. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:17:52
True. This is free unregulated market. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:26:59
How about your ISP? It should see you are sending info to a blockchain
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:49:10
Do you have your public keys? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:42:49
Average joe will lose probably, yes. I think it will rise and fall untill number of users is so big, that even big sharks can't really influence bitcoin price. Or it will crush to zero and never recover if scaling problems are not resolved.

Dip is happening 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:22:49
I wanted to sell 1/4 of my bitcoins at 19k too, but transaction got stuck, feels bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:31:44
But also buying it makes it more expensive, it will bounce back. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:09:37
It would be fun times if it did get hacked. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:24:38
Recently for 5$ each? She was either scammed or bought 5$ worth of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:03:39
I doubt that people you want to say "f you" are your real friends. Don't be so rude to them. They made a mistake and probably know about it. You didn't knew that bitcoin would raise as well as them, the only thing you had was hope. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:13:58
Not really. I've seen Paint saving old thumbnail after editing. 
My way of doing this is editing in whatever software and doing a window screenshot. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:51
Well your dollar is different.

I was wondering if i could temporarily add private key to blockchain.info for one transaction? I don't mind entering it everytime
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:13:03
My strategy for this situation would be making transaction with extremely low fee hoping robber is moron.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:47:42
How would you know? This info could only be provided by exchange sites or a survey 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:46:45
If my wallet was not stolen by now and is secured by password should i worry about it? Does bitcoins get stolen immediately  when malware founds wallet.dat?
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:29:27
Ok, wait till it goes through or fails, then, 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:54:17
It would increase but buying power will probably stay the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:22:41
Some people transferred their coins to segwit wallet and are keeping it there. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:18:30
Dark Net Market rely on cryptocurrencies 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:42:56
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:21:46
I am new to bitcoin, but i would send the same amount with normal fee and hope that first transaction fails. Of it does not, then send bitcoins back to your first address when it arrives. I believe that you should be able to send it, because blockchain doesn't have new info about your wallet and it will accept second transaction.

I would send everything to hard wallet, but add public key to blockchain.info in watch only. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:05:44
Switch has a few great exclusives and also it is portable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:37:11
Thats what everyone is thinking. Im sure it will rise this time. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:24:43
Try another wallet software. Or an online one. Does looking up your public key on blockchain.info shows your new balance or an old one?
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:47:12
Why not bruteforce it with software? I don't know if it will selfdestruct or not

Its like you came from the future and are sure. OP, please don't spend all your saving on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:27
Probably protect.

4~5% of money. Im not including real estate, cars, etc. Bought at 9000, pretty late
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:04:06
This made me sad
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:51:18
 Thx!
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:16:52
Does segwit transaction have to be both input and output segwit, or input only? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:24:25
Buying something with BTC is the sane as cashing out. But you get goods instead of cash. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:24:40
I think this is good video, author has a point.

Your crystal ball is wrong, mine says it will be 10x larger. Stop misinformation. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:18:35
Ok, got it. Thanks!

Much easier then previous riddle where you had to count flames IIRC
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:48:12
My transaction was confirmed with 3 sat/byte fee! Dope. 
Also am i correct that my address starting with bc1 is segwit address? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:22:57
I should have mentioned that i am not looking for a profit, but rather am just interested. AFAIK i am mining in a nicehash pool right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:55:09
I was experimenting with mining on my PC with AwesomeMiner and i have a question how do i access my funds? Do they send it to my btc address daily or i should request a withdraw? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:17:18
Why would you say that? Are you monitoring my Reddit habits? I hold no Bcash and believe OG Bitcoin to be the future, but this guy has his point. We can't be sure how Lightning will work out. Please be respectful to different opinions rather then yours. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 11:40:26
The best about Russia that its laws rarely work. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:03:50
Why would anyone want his private key if they doesn't want to use it for the same reasons?
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:26:08
I am interested how do i get payed my few dollars i mined. Will they automatically be sent to my bitcoin address?

If everyone will turn their asics, difficulty will drop and i would mine with my card. People somehow mined back in 2010, no? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:17:26
You think mining hardware won't increase in perfomance?
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:12:05
Would you return me my $5 if you are wrong?
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:53:12
I would like too, but have not enough bandwidth and storage. Running node right now is complicated :(
