@_date: 2012-12-06 21:26:43
Thanks for the info. It seems like it will be very difficult for a newby to turn a profit on mining bit coins from hear on out without a massive upfront investment. 
@_date: 2012-12-14 03:30:39
I agree.
I'm all for seeing bitcoin succeed but proselytizing and spamming people with bitcoin videos and posts is dumb. A lot of people see bitcoin as a pyramid scheme precisely because of this kind of behavior. This is not helpful to anyone.
@_date: 2012-12-12 00:38:05
Will people ever learn to store their BTC offline?
@_date: 2012-12-09 19:15:02

Interesting. Looking at your comment history, most if your responses are in defense of MtGox. How much is MtGox paying you?
I don't see how me telling someone to GTFO out MtGox while the getting is still good is in anyway going to contribute the problems they already created for themselves. Shall we recap MtGox sordid history? 
Lost customer money on multiple occasions
Multiple DDOS shutdowns because MtGox couldn't handle more than 30 trades per sec (WTF?)
Failure to register as a money transmitter
Seizure of funds
A failed partnership resulting in a $75m lawsuit
Failure to return customer USD funds
Failure to address multiple security issues
If anything, the Bitcoin economy will be better off without MtGox. Whatever shorter term pain their shut down inflicts on Bitcoin is well worth it in the long term. And I'm sorry to be the one to break it to you but the the collapse of MtGox is inevitable at this point. Their funds are fronzen, the feds are after them, they're embroiled in a large civil lawsuit (more will follow), their published exchange rate is pure fantasy and most importantly, the market has lost all confidence in MtGox.

This is about the 3rd or 4th time I've read the exact same story about MtGox in the last couple of weeks and its always the same response from them: contact your local police. Unfortunately as more noobs to bitcoin join MTGox their attitude has the potential to undermine confidence in bitcoin itself.  
I think the bitcoin economy is too reliant on MtGox bot for currency trading and price discovery. Its a weak point in th system.

Bitcoin is not a stock. There are many ways to convert bitcoins into USD the easiest of which is probably Coinbase.

**'Bitcoin is a currency': Federal judge says the virtual cash is real money**
Aug. 8, 2013 at 3:47 PM ET
Is the "online crypto-currency" Bitcoin money like dollars or is it no more the business of government regulators than virtual gold pieces in an online game? A federal judge may have ended the controversy with an opinion issued in a Bitcoin-related fraud case — and the verdict is: It's money.
The defendant, Texan Trendon Shavers, is accused by the SEC of committing fraud in the form of a Bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme worth millions of dollars in today's Bitcoin market. But Shavers challenged the authority of the U.S. District Court where he was being tried, on the grounds that Bitcoins do not actually meet the definition of money, and therefore could not be the basis for a fraud charge.
In response, Magistrate Judge Amos Maazant of the Eastern District of Texas federal court examined the evidence and concluded otherwise. He explains his sources and reasoning in a remarkably concise and readable memorandum (PDF). Here are the most important bits:
Shavers argues that the BTCST investments are not securities because Bitcoin is not money, and is not part of anything regulated by the United States. Shavers also contends that his transactions were all Bitcoin transactions and that no money ever exchanged hands. The SEC argues that the BTCST investments are both investment contracts and notes, and, thus, are securities. 
It is clear that Bitcoin can be used as money. It can be used to purchase goods or services, and as Shavers stated, used to pay for individual living expenses. The only limitation of Bitcoin is that it is limited to those places that accept it as currency. However, it can also be exchanged for conventional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, Euro, Yen, and Yuan. Therefore, Bitcoin is a currency or form of money, and investors wishing to invest in BTCST provided an investment of money.
The way Judge Maazant characterizes Bitcoin, notably, is not akin to a dollar or ruble, but rather like a precious metal or some other valuable resource. Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy organization, suggests this is an important and logical step.
"The ruling is interesting," he wrote in an email to NBC News, "because it highlights the fact that Bitcoin is becoming recognized as commodity money in the same way that gold and silver are recognized as money."
This may lead to it being recognized more widely — Matonis speculates that it could even get a nod from the International Standards Organization under ISO 4217, a classification for "non-national" commodities that don't need to be issued or backed by any government.
Indeed, Bitcoin seems to be traveling on the road towards legitimacy, though that legitimacy may bring as many challenges as it does benefits, as recent struggles by Bitcoin exchanges and businesses show.
Shavers' day in court is not over yet, so this opinion may yet be nullified — or overturned in an appeal or new case. This legal determination may seem a mere nicety considering Bitcoin's already-significant user base, but if it is to be adopted as a real international online currency, such measures are necessary and desirable.

Yes but bitcoins are substantially cheaper on BTCE than any other exchange outside china so clearly people are willing to take a much bigger loss selling bitcoins on that market vs any other. 
As of right now:
BTCE $705
MTgotx $820
bitstamp $830
bitfinex $836
And BTCE has the largest trading volume. What is the advantage of selling there?

I'm sorry if my comment compelled you to make an ass of yourself. If you have a better idea of what exactly is going on at coinbase, we're all ears. Clearly something is wrong over there. From their own web site:






Now how do you service that many transactions with just $600k in capital + 1% fee while taking on almost a week's worth of exchange rate risk on every transaction in a currency that increased more than 5x since coinbase started doing business? It doesn't add up. I hope I'm wrong but I think they ran out of money.

In that situation the customer's funds might never clear and in the mean time the price of bitcoin could drop leaving coinbase with a loss on the bitcoins they prepurchased. Without forcing the customer to deposit USD funds, coinbase has to take on exchange rate risk.
EDIT: I think you are correct in your assetment and they probably did some of that. In a normal currency market an exchange like coinbase would work to hedge its risk in both directions. In this situation the extreme movement in bitcoin probably overcame their effort to minimize risk and quickly ate through their cash reserves.

I think they got screwed by the exploding exchange rate. They tried to minimize exchange risk by not buying bitcoins with their own money ahead of time. They only buy the bitcoins once they have the customer's cash in place. Problem is the price of bitcoin went up between the point when the order came in and the point where they bought the BTC from MTGox. Now they're in a position where they have to cover that difference with USD out of pocket which creates a money losing business. The faster bitcoin goes up the more money they lose. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:51:27

@_date: 2013-03-28 16:04:47


Thats a big leap. Unlike the hypothetical coinstamp, Bitcoin can be divided down to 8 decimal places and the protocol can adapt to an infinite number of decemal places. Its usefulness does not diminish with increased USD exchange rate. While the Bitcoin protocol has been copied numerous times and there are competing currencies, the vast majority of users will adopt whatever is most useful to them. Competition makes cryptocurrency stronger.

I'm sorry but an economy stuck with a deflationary currency is going to be desasterous. Take a look at Japan for the last 20 years. Production costs keep going up while spending is disincentivised. Bitcoin is great for those us using it for savings but it can not exist in a vacuum. It will always exists along side fiat currencies. 
@_date: 2013-01-01 01:23:15
The real question is at what point do you give up on the USD and move all your savings into BTC.

No, this doesn't change your existing transactions. All the existing transactions are still there in the blockchain. They can't be changed no matter what you do. By resetting blockchain and transactions in your wallet you're simply telling multibit to reference the existing blockchain starting on that data. When you reset you'll see your balance go to zero, then slowly build up to its current correct value as it gets to the current date.

And if you look at some stock market derivatives, folks are qure bullish on those as well. Whats your point exactly?
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:58:55
Nobody needs to buy the bitcoins. The protocol can be modified and improved if a majority of developer and nodes agree to it. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:45:14
Butthurt because you misjudged the market?

@_date: 2013-03-21 22:29:39
Its pretty obvious how their system works. As a bitcoin purchaser you can lock in the bitcoin price at the moment you execute a purchase but coinbase waits for the ACH money transfer to go through before they release the bitcoins to you. In that period of time they are taking currency risk in one of 2 ways. Either they purchase the coins immediately and hold them until the funds clear or they only purchase the coins after the funds are clear. Either way they are taking on risk in that period of time by not forcing you to despot USD cash with them. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:22:12
Thats a good idea. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:53:31

No, bitcoin foundation and the bitcoin community at large does not exist to do law enforcement. This is equivalent to the idiots camped out in the fastlane of a busy freeway going 55mph despite the flow of traffic moving at 75mph+. Leave the law enforcement work to the people getting paid to do it. Any tweak to bitcoin that chips away at privacy will be used against **ALL OF US**.

Good, I hope they crash the price of BTC so I can buy more. The useful value of bitcoin as an annonymous, easy to hide, easy to transport, easy to transmit currency will still be there and so will be the economy that is being constructed around it. Bitcoin will remain a useful tool no matter what the exchange rate.

"Technical analysis" is code idiot.

If the blockchain goes under, you'll have much bigger problems to worry about like do I want want to continue to live in a post apocalyptic hellscape or should I just kill myself now.

Nothing in bitcoin is guaranteed, these are unregulated markets. Uncle Sam doesn't have your back. Go research the specifics of each exchange and figure it out on your own. We're all aware of the same obvious facts you are. The question is are **YOU** capable of depositing and withdrawing money from each exchange in a timely manner that makes the endeavor worth your time? Are you aware of the fact that some of these exchanges are more trust worthy than others or are subject to local capital controls? 
@_date: 2013-03-06 05:48:46
Geeks are no longer the new money. Its institutional investors. Average people will come much later after the institutions make them feel safe using BTC.

Never store bitcoins in an online wallet.

you fuckwit
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:45:45
Hes taking issue with my assertion of less than 10% vs his 22% when the real failure is the fact that Mtgox was the majority of the market in the first 2 crashes (one of which was triggered by Mtgox technical failure) and today Mtgox is just one of many minority players. And people still can't withdraw USD from Mtgox, skewing prices on that exchange far from the average. 
The OP's Mtgox based analysis is bull shit.

You don't understand this market and you're going to continue losing money. This isn't for you.
@_date: 2013-02-20 20:21:14
Just because 1 bitcoin is worth more than 1 oz of silver doesn't make it a better or worse investment. Its a completely meaningless comparison. The only thing that matters is % change over time. Also Google and Apple are securities not currencies and again not analogous for this comparison.
Your lack of investment knowledge is painfully obvious. Don't take it this the wrong but I hope you have a chance to educate yourself before making any big financial decisions.

His main argument is that merchants won't accept bitcoin because its too volatile. He doesn't realize that merchants can be paid in Bitcoin and have it instantly converted into USD.

I agree. The author makes some very good points. unfortunately, Bitcoiners to are too chicken shit to actually read the whole thing and upvote this link. For this reason and many others, Bitcoin is doomed.

For how much?
What are the terms of insurance?
Would the insurance pay in dollars or bitcoins?
Will account holders be anonymous?

I'm guessing they're trying to serve as many customers and possible and give priority to smaller orders. The coinbase guys will probably come to this thread by the end of the day to sort things out. They are very responsive to @_date: 2013-04-24 14:42:14

Remove your bitcoins from MtGox while you still can. Exchange them for USD somewhere else.

No, obviously they sell them to MtGox just to they can buy them back from MtGox to hand off to the next customer. What do you think coinbase is... an exchange?
