I currently have my crypto being held through Robinhood but I found my old ledger so it’s time to start moving everything over. Does anyone have experience with using cash app as a brokerage for btc?

I like how under his breath he laughed at what he eas saying
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:24:33
And that shitty filter when there was upclose shots
@_date: 2014-12-09 04:35:37
I am about to go buy bitcoins would you say breadwallet or coinbase
@_date: 2014-12-05 13:34:07
Thank you very much. I am going to wait and see how the auction affects prices
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:10:54
why did u go with the apple watch vs the cheaper and better competitors
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:54:51
ok thank you
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:30:59
I hope this actually works out i know of places that sya they accept but dont actually accept because they "dont have the system up"
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:32:21

I didn't far so well I bought bitcoin  when it was $324 a few weeks ago
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:39:11
There is a system some good news out of a crash on poeple can buy for the first time
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:13:34
I am yet to find a place near me for me to do this 
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:05:24
As a poorer member of this subreddit I'm trying to grab any bitcoins I can get now 
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:31:33
It really is nice to see bitcoin become more and more accepted every day
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:09:04
I want a dicktowl the  thing from sunny in Philadelphia with bitcoins around the towl
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:00:27
I am trying to find a way to buy know bitcoins rn and this sub keeps me in the loop 
@_date: 2015-01-31 06:24:19
Bitcoin has a strong chance due to the security of bitcoin and that large banks like visa are not adapting and charging a ridiculously high rate to move money 
@_date: 2015-01-31 06:18:05
Having now in Google now makes this title work so well
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:11:38
What's a dnm?  Sorry I'm familiar with bitcoin but I have no clue what a dnm is
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:18:25
I feel like its one guy trying to get his crypto popular so I just respond with Bill Burr quotes
@_date: 2016-01-09 04:41:14
I've been around bitcoins for awhile I've just never encountered this scenario. I'll try circle 
Edit: circle did not work
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:34:45
Don't we say this every year 
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:18:42
So you're giving away 7 dollars
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:20:26
I'll most likely sell at 1500 to buy a car then work my way back up to where I am now
@_date: 2017-01-03 06:33:32
Most people agree if you have a large sum of cash it's best to invest straight up. Dollar cost averaging works best if you have income and want to invest it 
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:15:52
Wow I completely forgot about this comment. Bitcoin generally takes two steps forward and one step back. IMO the start of the rally was at 700 so it was pretty easy to see where it heads back down to to stabilize.
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:25:02
19 million was just dumped into the market just let it handle itself
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:31:19
Drops down to 900 and stays stable there for a bit
@_date: 2017-01-03 06:31:33
The good ole' Mt.Gox precaution
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:44:40
It's down for me, it may be due to panic sale
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:51:12
Wrong move, don't play the market just hold and put more in. DCA is free and retard proof
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:21:04
To get any sizeable amount of bitcoin you have to pay. The only way i can think of how to get "free" bitcoin is by just being active in the sub people tip all the time 
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:00:00
I'm on this sub all the time don't know the two terms you just mentioned 
@_date: 2015-08-19 04:17:30
Wait why is the price dropping I'm pit of the loop 
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:28:33
We will install rockets
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:33:51
Nice I'm currently working on a business plan for a start up and the ability to accept bitcoin easily is awesome
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:07:39
The ball is in Greeces hands the Grexit is still a thing 
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:40:28
Is that worth the drop in price btc has had
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:16:54
Do your part and help grow the economy start a small business that accepts bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:01:48
And during this time it has been a month since coinbase has gotten back to me about unfreezing my account
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:02:02
Looks like getting an entropy for paper wallets will be helpful now 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:21:06
They initially reported me as not being 18
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:58:21
How did you promote bitcoin with posters or word of mouth? 
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:22:37
Are you planninng on destroying it as soon as you get a print&amp;
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:27:09
With evolution going down I want to start my own darknet Craigslist that's reliable, but jail doesmy sound like fun
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:40:35
god damn you need to destroy every data center where this conversation is ~~held~~
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:38:45
I have investments in American green and I won bitcoin this is gonna be a good time for me
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:54:59
You could put a paper wallet inside a cheap McDonald's gaming thing
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:03:07
One is much more secure and the other can be counterfeited 
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:03:52
How does the price get manipulated
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:30:57
I gave some money to ms because they are a large company and it will make bitcoin more recognizable and not just a weird projecct in the corner
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:18:52
So having GOX go down was a better thing for the bitcoin economy
@_date: 2015-03-04 04:08:01
So many things could fall. Under that name why won't they give more 
@_date: 2015-02-21 02:35:37
I think stability will help the currency but the complete instability is fun
@_date: 2015-02-27 04:12:49
After a down but this is quite nice to see
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:34:29
Humans are the reason 300 mil was stolen in fiat we must end this virus
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:15:47
Can I do this in the US 
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:52:10
I need to get a bit shirt if it so my school will use bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:06:22
You will encounter the wierdest ups and downs while at work while bitcoin does it thing
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:04:00
Why is everyone recommending the trezor over Ledger 
@_date: 2015-02-09 04:14:40
2,000 bits
:this incentives me to get an offlline vault
@_date: 2015-02-20 04:46:00
Sry Im new to bitcoin just bought my first few a bit ago. Who are you
@_date: 2015-02-08 07:36:16
Would it be safe to run the backend of it with bitcoin as a more secure way to move money
@_date: 2015-02-20 15:37:27
I didnt watch it yesterday but i recorded it
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:50:38
My school thinks bitcoin is a shit fqioing currency or they hav3eno idea what it is, change tip is why this whole thing is awesome. I dont need the bits so you tip if you want.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:21:40
As bitcoin adoption grows and the inflation rate shrinks the price has a high chance of going up over the next few years 
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:48:10
!remind me December 21 2021
@_date: 2015-02-20 04:47:58
