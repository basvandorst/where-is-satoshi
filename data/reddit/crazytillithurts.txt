You aren't missing anything. Lightning was/is half an idea that has run too far. It is a solution for the wrong problem
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:07:38
If by stronger, you mean BTC-&gt;USD, sure, if that is the metric you most care about... and it is because people with small amounts can't even move their coins without crazy fees and long waits.
Segwit isn't enough of a fix. Flat out, it isn't enough. Lightning will never be "done". This whole sub is like holding onto that one injured player on fantasy football because "when he comes back, man watch out!"

Ok, imagine you own a lemonade stand. It is a very popular lemonade stand at a busy intersection. For the most part, business seems to run smoothly, except those few times, like rush hour and lunch where there is too much going on and things get all backed up, people paying with large bills bleeds your change dry and things just aren't so smooth. What are some solutions?
Well, we could bring in someone else to help mitigate the problem. Maybe one person handles money while the other prepares and hands product. Either way, now you have two people instead of one to help throughput.
Orrrr.... you could set up a nationwide chain of other lemonade stands, complete with distribution logistics so that people can go to OTHER lemonade stands and mitigate the problems across a much larger system, so that they aren't so much of a problem anymore. This is the Lightning Network
It serves a purpose. Maybe even a good one. It is *NOT* a solution for the current transaction suffocation BTC is immediately dealing with.

I'm not buying it anymore. Look at the fees, number of transactions trying to go through. I doubt "almost" doubling the amount of transactions per block would even help now. This whole sub has become a "when X happens, we will be fine", but X at this point seems like it will never happen. Segwit is there, but it isn't. "Needs testing". Jesus. How much testing is needed at this point? For how long? Why would you tout a solution for the capacity problem then NOT EVEN HAVE A WAY TO USE IT? Lightning is "alpha" and "can be tested"... have you TRIED to test it? It is like testing linux in 1994. And it will be here "soon". Perpetually "soon"... and we don't even know if that will fix the issues at hand.

I don't think that only focusing on the blocksize is productive for a scaling solution. Perhaps we can lower the time between solved blocks. Maybe every solve, we could put TWO or more blocks on the blockchain. I don't know, but lets think differently.

Ok, tweaking some small bits is a totally different thing than "Nothing will become user-friendly before users become involved". Having something user-friendly out of the gates isn't unfathomable, or even uncommon. Outside of a terminal, it is quite frankly the norm. 
I would argue that making something functional and usable are two different things. Like your command line lightning app, it is there for a functional implementation, NOT for people to actually *use*. However, this digresses into a philosophical and technical discussion

vout appears to be a member variable meant to be a type based on an std::vector of bits, representing output (std::vector doesn't have an IsNull() member, so this may be actually testing for NULL or it may be testing if it was never set).
The outer loop goes byte by byte in the size of the output vector, and the inner loop goes for each bit in that byte. If a bit is non-NULL, the byte is flagged and the loop is broken. It is keeping track of the last non-NULL byte and how many bytes are not NULL. It then adds the position of the last non-NULL byte to nBytes , essentially counting the number of bytes trimming out any leading bytes that are NULL.
tl;dr It is counting non-zero bytes and adding the the last non-NULL byte position to total bytes

Sequence number or cryptographic hash, it doesn't matter. It is just a number. In the case of bitcoin, it has NO OTHER PURPOSE but to hash the contents of the transaction, just like a checks sequence numbers purpose is for personal bookkeeping, NOT A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER.
Imagine, if I did bank transfers to my wife's account in three transactions of $1, $2, and $5, in that order, but on the way, the bank reordered them to come in the order of $5, $2, and $1. Would you be content to claim the banking system is flawed, because that is all that is going on here. The $8 still makes it to the other end.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:59:21
The problem here is you are using the wrong key. The unique id is a composite of date, amount, to address, not the transaction id.
Think of is like a check going through a bank. Customers CAN use the same check number more than once. I personally have written check  three times with my current account because of starter checkbook, ordered checks, and a counter check. At first glance, using a check number as a unique identifier is a good idea, but it isn't. It isn't a flaw in the checking system. It is a flaw in ones assumptions. You would use a composite of the date, amount, to, etc as a composite key to uniquely identify a transaction.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:40:16
But that isn't going to necessarily work (in the US). Since the IRS sees bitcoins as property, if they appreciate in value against the dollar, spending or converting to USD will still require a capital gains tax payment. Since taxes were taken out at the time you were paid, you can probably subtract that amount from the capital gains that you owe, but you would still owe

This was always my thought; Here is a (real life) story called One Red Paperclip:
Essentially, a guy started with a single red paperclip and traded it all the way up to a house.
I believe bitcoins followed the same idea. At first, they were essentially worthless. Magic internet money that no one really cared about and couldn't really be spent on anything. What it took was one guy willing to trade SOMETHING of value for those first bitcoins/one red paperclip. It may not have been much value, but it established at that point that you could infact use these things for barter. Then things just took off from there

That is what he (and others that I have seen) are saying. The idea is, if one iota of the code has differing ideas on how the implementation should be carried out, it could cause a fork in the blockchain, and such.
I personally don't agree with this. If the whole world relied solely on one implementation to function, then any vulnerability found in said library can target everyone.

How is raising the blocksize going to resolve a spamming issue? The bad actors can spam just as proportionally many 1 satoshi transactions with whateverblocksize you can come up with. On the other side of the coin, higher fees won't stop them either as they just won't pay those either. A different approach is needed

I've kept out of this discussion for the most part, so I have a question I haven't seen addressed:
Transactions per second = Number of transactions per block / Time to solve the block (in seconds);
So increasing the size of the block is essentially making it possible to increase the number of transactions per second, correct?
Why is this the better approach vs. lowering the times between blocks?

Multiplying large matrices is quite the memory goblin. You can cache X rows, or you can can cache Y columns, but with enough size you can't cache enough. Then you get to read and write data to storage, which is a massive performance penalty.

If banks across the world are to do this every day, in multitudes, they need either blocks that have/miners to accept zero fee transactions, or they need to be REALLY low, right? Else the cost of getting all of this data onto the blockchain would eventually become prohibitive. Honestly asking, isn't this the core of the blocksize debate?

Someone explain this to me; why are we focusing on block size? If the goal is to push more transactions over time, why don't we adjust it so that blocks are solved in a shorter time?
The only thing I can think of is that the halving would come sooner than originally planned. But if we adjust the blocks to be solved on, say, an average of 5 minutes, we could double the number of blocks until the halving, keeping it on its usual schedule.
This would keep blocks at a size that current clients would understand going forward.

I truly don't know of the implications of such, but can't there be some modification so that there needs to be at least one transaction per block? I know that a block would still be the same format, so it isn't a compatibility issue... I don't think.
Sure, the people pumping out empty blocks won't follow suit and they will keep on mining their empty blocks. And everyone on board of the "Empty blocks are poo-poo" would reject those guys empty blocks. I'm speculate most of the network doesn't want them... only the people making money from it.

To be fair, it isn't *just* because of the 1MB blocksize limitation. Throughput could easily increase if you reduce the block solving time/lower difficulty. You would get just as many transactions through by increasing the blocksize by double as you would by chopping the solving time to 5 minutes.

The way I see it, whether you agree with faction A or X, I don't think any of the players goal is to murder bitcoin. Miners would stop having incentive to mine, and users would be disenfranchised to participate if they were purely destructive motives.
Some people have different ideas of what is the better approach. We can all wave our hands around and throw tantrums because others don't agree, but I think in the end, it will pan out fine.

Sure, I see what you are saying, but the block reward could be altered just the same to keep everything in harmony. Half the solve time, half the block reward. I see it ideologically no different than doubling the block size, except for the fact that blocks will still work with old clients/miners.

Honest question.
Doesn't increasing the block size just make it so that miners have to include that many more transactions with no fee on them?
Meaning, keeping the block size smaller gives the people willing to pay for priority, actual priority. When just about every junk transaction needs to be jammed into a block just to fill it, I don't see how this increases the actual monetary reward for mining a block. If anything, it would seem to kill the value of a transaction fee

Ebay were removing listings for people selling and buying bare (non-physical) bitcoins for a long time. People started getting around it by selling "a piece of paper signed personally by me" or "novelty keychain" for whatever the value of the bitcoins were with "x bitcoins free with purchase" kind of thing. Paypal would reverse any payment that went toward bitcoins and the seller was generally screwed. This is why when I was buying coins at  via paypal, you had to claim the purchase was a gift.
Then something happened within the past ~6 months. Paypal let listings stay. Paypal let transactions through. This has to be a conscious change of policy. Why? I don't know

Some design points:
- Don't underline anything that isn't a reference to something else. Remove them from the headers.
- Italic is inappropriate for headers. It is also inappropriate to identify significance. Also, the only time anything should be bold and italic is when you are bolding something within a quote
- Having the first chunk shifted to the right while everything else is shifted to the left messes up the reading flow
- The bullet point glyphs are over the top. Keep it simple and easy on the eyes
- Use the same font throughout the document (not something separate from the headers and the body)

First, you made quite a leap from my statement to assuming I even own bitcoins, let alone what I do with them.
Maybe you would feel more comfortable comparing bitcoins to bonds. Would that make you feel better? And running with that, people invest in the US dollar, just like any other currency. Because those don't follow *your* vision of its purpose, it "hurts the legitimacy"? Do you even know the definition of legitimate is?
Comparing it to stock in a company is a very good juxtaposition. My example was spot on. When Microsoft was a small company on the rise, demand for a piece of them was small, but the value of the stock grew as the company became more ubiquitous. While people in the 80's could buy thousands of stock for a nominal amount, now most people deal in partial shares or investment portfolios containing MS stock.

After each member within a series of three or more words, phrases, letters, or figures used with and, or, or nor.




When a conjunction joins the last two elements in a series, a comma ... should appear before the conjunction. Chicago strongly recommends this widely practiced usage....

Use a comma before the conjunction that precedes the last term in a series.




Use a comma between elements (including before and and or) in a series of three or more items.




For a century it has been part of OUP style to retain or impose this last serial (or series) comma consistently, [...] but it is commonly used by many other publishers both here and abroad, and forms a routine part of style in US and Canadian English. [...] Given that the final comma is sometimes necessary to prevent ambiguity, it is logical to impose it uniformly, so as to obviate the need to pause and gauge each enumeration on the likelihood of its being misunderstood – especially since that likelihood is often more obvious to the reader than the writer.


To separate the elements (words, phrases, clauses) of a simple series of more than 2 elements, including a comma before the closing “and” or “or” (the so-called serial comma). Routine use of the serial comma helps to prevent ambiguity.


Whether to include the serial comma has sparked many arguments. But it's easily answered in favor of inclusion because omitting the final comma may cause ambiguities, whereas including it never will.


Use commas to separate words, phrases, and clauses in a series.

I'm not going to post the entire Wikipedia article, but it clearly states that the absence of the last comma in a series is preferred by print, such as magazines and newspapers, to save space. It is accepted because this was the way it used to be done/taught, NOT because that is the accepted proper
