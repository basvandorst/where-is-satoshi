[I don't understand white Americas sympathy for the government of Cuba]( it is one of the most oppressive dictatorships in the world. A truly awful state of existence for all its citizens. And I don't think making light of it does justice to the people of Cuba who don't have even the most basic of human rights that we take for granted.

It certainly is the wild-wild-west out here. But bitcoin is in its infancy, it's only natural that it will have its growing pains. I was scammed the very same way, but I'm still using bitcoin. There is no cheaper way to send money around the globe. And there is no other way for me to place a little money on my favorite sports team. In this time, where governments are increasingly prohibiting more and more and taking more and more, bitcoin appears to be a viable option. Would you rather have bitcoin or your money in a Cyprus bank account..... And it if can happen to the people of Cyprus.. then why not anywhere else?....

Bitcoin is defined by the US government as a commodity, not a currency. Besides, that isn't the argument here. The argument is that PayPal does not offer adequate security controls on its accounts. And in the event of fraud, they punish the merchants - and in that way, they have no incentive to improve account security. In fact, when I sold to a hacked account, PayPal took not only my proceeds, but charged me a $20 fine. Therefore they are profiting from allowing accounts to be hacked. Even if you believe they should take my proceeds... surely you don't believe that I should be fined $20 for selling to a person in good faith.

If I were a criminal, then that would concern me. But I am not. I am merely a victim seeking change in what I see as an unjust system. PayPal should not profit from hacked accounts. And unsuspecting merchants should not have to suffer because of their poor account security.

There is a lot of misinformation going around, because there is a lot of money to make in manipulating the market... those sites would help to confirm your creditability, so that the regular people know you're legit, and not just some random guy with a bunch of reddit accounts trying to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:10:28
So it was a column, to be honest, I think that makes it even worse. Krugman wasn't put on the spot with a question he wasn't prepared for. Unlike Friedman, which was said during an interview, Krugman had plenty of time to think out his response. I guess the problem with Krugman, is that he does economics in a vacuum - and that doesn't really apply well to the real world.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:54:43
I would agree, but they called and said if I didn't pay then they would report me to the credit agencies. I felt it was unjust, but there is not much I could do about it. It could take years to repair my credit score with the damage they could do to it, it just wasn't worth it. It felt like extortion, but I have no recourse. I just have to pay. And they keep collecting a fee for every account that gets hacked.

For the most part, the Tea Party believes big government is the problem, the big banks couldn't exist w/out government bailing them out or w/ the competition that would exist if the barrier to entry into the market wasn't so high due to regulations and licencing fees / taxes. OWS seems to want bigger government b/c they continually talk about higher taxes which would only lead to more government spending and corruption. OWS is somewhat "progressive" aka naive, while the Tea Party is more libertarian minded. I welcome OWS into the bitcoin community, as long as they leave their politics at home.

I was a victim of this scam as well... I know... I should have known better. I tried for months to try and get PayPal to investigate, but they had zero interest in finding the origin of the fraud. They just refunded the hacked account and foot me with the bill. On top of that, they charged me a $20 fee because one of their user's accounts was hacked. I got curious and found that there are [a whole bunch of hacked PayPal accounts out there.. and they are really easy to buy]( I personally believe it is shameful that a company like PayPal, for one, doesn't offer better account security and, two, that they do not investigate hacked/fraudulent accounts.

Considering that PayPal charges a fee to merchants that unknowingly sells to hacked accounts..... I guess exposing their poor account security only helps them... that's one hell of a business model they have.

The others aren't following MT Gox because no one at Gox can take advantage of the current arbitrage opportunities. As soon as they can, i.e. can withdraw from Gox, then it will begin to really effect the other markets.... in a bad way, if you still own BTC. Gox withdrawals will flood the sell side and drive the market price down on all the other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:46:44
As soon as MT Gox allows withdrawals, the market will crash. People will be flooding the sell side with BTC, driving down the price. If you, at the very least, haven't realized your wins yet, then you're just an idiot.

I don't know of any alternatives really, but whatever you do - DON'T USE PAYPAL - an any transaction, buying or selling. I did use localbitcoin to buy w/ my Dwolla account though and it worked well.

PayPal only allows you to transfer $500 / week of "unsettled" funds to external accounts. And even if you get the money out, the victums of hacked accounts have 45 days to file a claim. At which point, PayPal will rule in their favor and take the money from your account. If you do not have the money in your account, they will turn your account over to a third party debt collector and basically destroy your credit rating. On top of that, they will charge you a $20 fee because you unknowingly sold, in good faith, something to a hacked account.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:38:04
It's a roll of the dice, but based on my experience, it's certainly not worth the risk. I did a little research, and within 20 minutes I was capable  of buying hundreds of hacked PayPal accounts... [this is only one of the sites I found...](

If there isn't a viable libertarian candidate, then you need to be supporting the Republican candidate in your district. A smaller federal government w/ less control over people's lives is what we should all be in favor of. And that is, non-important social fringe issues aside, is what the right stands for. Liberals want to raise taxes, give the feds more money and more control, that in my opinion is a step in the wrong direction.

Hard to imagine a country who saw the differences between E. &amp; W. Germany would fall so quickly into such policies, but I'm assuming it's being driven by the youth vote.

They'd consider that tax evasion. And that's pretty serious in Sweden, we're talking jail time. 
You will actually have more trouble than if you rape someone. I am not exagerrating.
Also in Sweden, Kronofogen will hound you for the rest of your life for full recovery of the money and all costs. They have the right to seize all assets, bank accounts, investment, properties, vehicles, furniture, clothing, etc.
It is the one area of Sweden law which is very good and heavily enforced. The Skat (tax) office and Koronofogen do not have time limits on pursuit of monies owed. They are required to pursue until death and seize the estate upon death, if not all debts are paid.
Also If you flee abroad, kronofogen does inform every credit agency on the planet that it can contact that you owe money. Kronofogen can be vindicntive and makes a point of it if you flee. They are OK if you stay in Sweden and pay your debts.
In plain language don't try to pull the stunts in Sweden that Americans pull in the UK and Ireland. You will end up in real trouble.
