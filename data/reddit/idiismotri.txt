Excellent post. You just explained the world why bitcoin will fail.
The  in your post are not ''small errors'', but MOTHERFUCKING HUGE ERRORS. Nerdy enthousaists &amp; wannabe-investors on Reddit will blast it away and say it will ''survive'', but soon they'll be making their loss back by sucking dicks at the trainstation. 
Bitcoin bubble will burst.
Anyone not saying so is a fool. They're the same ones laughing at Warren Buffett, the world's most successful investor because ''he doesn't know anything about bitcoin.'' Fucking idiots. The guy is one of the major shareholders in IBM and has a greater understanding of anything in life than you do. And he doesn't understand ''bitcoin''? What the **FUCK** do you think bitcoin is? Rocket science? If you think so, then also stop thinking that it will EVER be adopted. Nobody is interested in studying rocket science when they want to buy a tomato.

No, they are not. Stop spreading lies and leading people into financial misery. You clearly don't know how the Chinese financial system works.

Hahaha, what you're saying is actually a load of horse shit. With a combination of bull shit. Just a little over 3 months ago Bitcoin was priced around $150 USD. The bitcoin has been rising ever since. The real crash is yet to come.
Only 9-10 months ago, it lost over 80% of its value in a matter of days. It could happen again - easily. And a lot of people will be crying when it happens, especially those who are holding on to their bitcoins because they have been brainwashed by the hype the last several months - and that's what it is, a hype. The price is rising because everyone wants a piece. The ''100K'' propaganda has driven a lot of people mad, paying over $1,000 for something they don't know horseshite about. Not realizing that they just paid a full 3-year salary of an African for a ''bitcoin''. A digital code.
That's what bitcoin is: a digital code. 
Nothing more. 
Please hoard up as much as you can. Don't let me stop you from going bankrupt. By all means.
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:16:53
I don't think so. We will see the true effect on or before January 31st, when Chinese can not withdraw their money anymore.
Let it sink in: After January 31st, no more Chinese money will enter the Chinese exchanges. Chinese can no longer withdraw their money. They can not use it anymore for daily expenses. It is dead money. It is like monopoly money. 
Before that date, people will still be able to trade in bitcoins. And Chinese will do that. They will try to get as much of our money as possible.

This shouldn't be a problem since you claim that you ''can show me a million charts''. If I don't receive these 100 charts, which are all representing a different stock/share etc. within the next 2 hours, it simply means that you are a liar and an extremely unreliable source of information.

Hahaha, u mad bro? The truth hurts, doesn't it?
From 2010 - 2013 was all just ''pre pump''. 2014 was the dump.
People are desperately trying to get BTC &amp; LTC at current levels. Microsoft, Huobi, new ventures, Draper buying up tens of thousands of coins, etc. All had no effect.
But Mark Karpeles, THE KING, managed to pump it single handedly :).
Also, from 2010-2013, all of that could've been MtGox too :).

Atheism is a religion invented by Satan to disturb the peace on Earth.
Religious violence was not-existing until Satan came into play.
All bad works on Earth are a representation of the Satan worshipping atheists. The Bitcoin Foundation controlled-media is trying to brainwash the God loving, hard working man, by introducing Bitcoin, an instrument of one of Satan's instrument, as a replacement for the God-given USD currency, on which is stated: *''In God We Trust''*.

I am sure no one reads this as all the delusional bitcoin fanatics downvote anything negative. But in case you do, and in case you share the same 'opinion' as I do, here is a little tip from an 'insider': as I am close to an exchange, a huge dump is planned in the near future. The exchange will go temporarily offline (like many times before) in order to fulfill the sell-orders successfully. There is a special reason why I am writing this, but I will not disclose it, as it might harm me. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 07:48:02
No, you should not. Don't listen to the people here. They are systematically downvoting anything negative related to Bitcoin. I just read that someone's father killed himself because of Bitcoin investing. Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is temporary, and will never be mass-adopted. In a few months from now, it will trade below $10. Don't buy. Keep your money.

They could start hacking people who deal in bitcoin, they might put a lot of effort into destroying the bitcoin network by hacking it (for example double spending), causing a massive crash. They might start fining companies who accept bitcoins (like Overstock), making the currency useless. When the currency starts being used underground again, they could do the same as with Silkroad &amp; maybe start prosecuting those who continue to use the currency.
Many ways to fuck you up. They really don't need one person to blame. If they want to (and they can), they will go after anyone using bitcoins.

@_date: 2014-01-31 21:45:04
**This is an official response from Idi-i-Smotri's office to the horrible allegations made by the Bitcoin-controlled Media:**
*Our sources have confirmed that created this post after being paid an unconfirmed sum of bitcoins by the Bitcoin Foundation, to restore the trust by making false allegations about a trusted, reliable person on financial fields (Link to the ILLEGAL allegation:
**Idi-i-Smotri condemns all illegal allegations made by the Bitcoin Foundation controlled-media about him, his followers, or his family.**
OFFICIAL RESPONSE: 
I do not understand why the Bitcoin Foundation controlled-media is trying to make fun of me. I am an intellectual who has predicted many crashes and bubbles, including the housing bubble several years ago. 
I also predicted the crash of bitcoin. And I will continue to emphasize the dangers of this 'currency'. A currency which is illegal, and used for criminal practices, such as purchasing weapons, hiring assassins, and laundering money. 
I did not bite the dust. I admit that I made a mistake by mentioning the 31st without mentioning the year I meant, but I obviously meant January 31, 2015. By that time, **the bitcoin bubble will burst.** 
Today, **the US Treasury announced that they would not regulate the criminal ''Bitcoin'' currency.** I fully understand their stance on this matter. It is obvious that the *pro-bitcoin fascists* want to wipe out the honest banks, the banks of the hard working man, by introducing a currency which will hurt those who do not have enough understanding of new technology.
Very few people have adopted the bitcoin currency. This will not change in the future. The bitcoin currency is not a currency meant for the common, hard working, god loving man. The bitcoin currency is an untraceable currency meant **to encourage the greed within men.** As we all know, *greed is one of the sins mentioned in the Holy Bible. I am not saying bitcoin is one of Satan's instruments, but it sure is an instrument of one of Satan's instruments.*
I will continue to spread the truth about bitcoin. I know the *bitcoin fascists* will do everything within their power to make my life as miserable as possible. I am already blocked from 60% of the bitcoin-related websites. Sometimes, they even label me as a ''troll'', or even force me to use a ''CAUTION: TROLL'' profile photo. This reminds of the Jews during World War 2, who were forced to wear David Stars. 
I encourage everyone to sell their bitcoins. **The bitcoin 'currency' will crash, there is no doubt about that.** 
I would like to finish this statement with a quote from the famous French Philosopher Rene Descartes: 
*''I am because I am.''*
I think of that quote every day, simply to show the haters that I still am, despite the fact that they want me to not am. 
Thank you.

- Unreliability 
- Untraceable, excellent currency for criminals / launderers, etc. 
- It's not backed by anything
- Volatility 
- Unrealiable exchanges (MtGox, for example)

@_date: 2014-02-15 10:14:34
So fake news. They have made this up. It's activated for a while, but I am willing to bet $100 that it will be disabled again, soon. They are just waiting for the price to rise, then they will sell everything and continue to do this until they have the funds available again. Just like MtGox. 
MtGox was the first to announce this problem, they are the largest exchange, and they haven't fixed this issue yet. But Bitstamp does it in like, a few days? Hahaha, right... 
My prediction:
- They'll regain trust. People make huge deposits. Then it's disabled again. They sell with the new BTC they have (deposits). Withdrawals are disabled. People deposit more money to make up for their 'losses' and buy up the 'cheap' coins. Price goes up. Withdrawals are enabled again.

They are in this for money and the only reason they downvote negative bitcoin posts, is because they don't want the value of their holdings to decrease. An extremely small part of all bitcoins is spend and/or donated. I am sure at least 95% of bitcoins is bought and hold to trade, not to spend as a currency. So don't be fooled by what everyone here says. 
If you read my post history, you will see that I am against this bitcoin ponzi scheme, which is used by criminals and will not last long. I think the bubble will collapse mid 2014. 
A lot of people think ''I missed the boat'', but I haven't. I have enough money in bitcoin exchanges and own several bitcoins and other coins (which I will sell today, I made a profit, that's enough for me).

Bitcoin donations to the Church can only be made via a trusted, entitled entity. The bitcoins have to be blessed &amp; holy water must be sprinkled over the bitcoin-wallet to chase away any bad, inner intentions, planted by Satan. We must be careful with how we proceed with bitcoin donations. It must be on a paper wallet in which the words ''In God We Trust'' are engraved, and a dollar sign $ must be placed next to it, just to fool the eyes of Satan and make the transactions from the Satan currency to the God-given USD currency, as smoothly as possible.

I feel so sorry for what happened to your father. I have been reading a lot of these posts, but everything is getting downvoted by the Bitcoin fascists in this subreddit. Enough is enough.
Please send me a PM and I will try to get your story to a major US news outlet. I have a few connections and this is a story which needs to be heard. People must realize that Bitcoin is destroying lives and causes mass-suicides.

I have put full trust in the dollar, which is god-given currency.
Anyone who does not trust in the God-given Dollar currency of the United States of **AMURICA** (GOD, THANK YOU FOR OUR NATION!), is a heathen. 
Does bitcoin mention ''In God we Trust'' ? **No, it does NOT!** It is an instrument of one of Satan's instruments to destroy God's currency. 
Donate to the Church!

This doesn't mean anything. The Chinese government still controls all supplies. And if the Chinese take a risk like this, they will be charged with money laundering and/or criminal activities.
China made clear that they do not like/embrace bitcoin.
They have banned Chinese bitcoin exchange accounts.
If you, as a Chinese citizen, still try to fuck with those rules, you can be certain that you will end up in jail for a very long time. 
This would be a serious offense and I highly doubt if Chinese investors ''whales'' will take a chance like this.
First of all:
- It is already extremely hard for Chinese to get their money out of the exchanges IN CHINA. There are already restrictions in place. 
Second of all:
- BTC-e is still a very shady exchange. Nobody knows who is operating this exchange. Smart Chinese traders will avoid btc-e at all cost and call it the day and stop trading.

I have downvoted your post. You can do and say whatever you want, the almighty God has given you a tongue to speak your mind, but it does not mean it is true. The mind is controlled by Satan, so the tongue given to you by God (*Oh Lord, OH LORD!*) does not have much purpose in this life. I forgive you for your sins, but I can not promise that God will forgive you for your sins.

In the last 4 minutes, over 2500 bitcoins bought in China, but the price is still dropping:
Why? They are dumping the coins almost instantly.
They are buying in China &amp; dumping somewhere else.

This post will go unnoticed because nobody believes it, but we were behind the buy order at 10.7, and we will sell below market value when it reaches 13.5-14ish to make it crash harder :). Expect to see 9 soon (only to repeat the process until it is back at 2.5, will be done in a 6.5 week period). 
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:21:49
GO fuck off! You're a phony bitcoiner... bitcoin was not made to be like other currencies, it was made TO AVOID TAXES AND DO THINGS WITHOUT BEING DETECTED.

**WOW, THIS IS REALLY BAD NEWS!!**
The last time a Chinese exchange faked volume, the price of bitcoin crashed from around $1200 to around $400!
Bitcoin is, like Litecoin, in a downtrend guys! Every week it's going up and down, but every week the bottom is lower than previous week!
NUMBER OF BITCOIN MILLIONAIRES DECREASED FROM OVER 1,000 TO AROUND 600. The millionaires are dumping their coins!

China entered the market, market cap increased to 10 billion. When China leaves, market cap will collapse to 2.5 billion. Price of bitcoin will drop to around $200 USD a piece and stabilize for several months. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:36:08
It's not even close. The market value is EXTREMELY ULTRA SMALL compared to the entire economy. 
Bitcoin will fall soon. It will be one of many ''additional payment methods'', but it will never replace normal currency. People who think that are delusional. 
I expect a massive crash on/before January 31st. It's just a few days from now, if I was you, I would cash out before then because when you cash out when everyone else does, it is already too late. Your sell order will not even fulfill, by the time you have confirmed your order, it will already be $10 lower. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 08:03:15
Exactly. But they didn't, and they won't. That's exactly what I am saying. 
So the question is: why don't they do it? They have the means to do it, and it looks like a very nice profit (more profit than most banks make in a year, or even banks combined). What is the current market cap? 10 billion? That's peanuts to some banks. Richest bank in the world has $3000 billion assets. 10 billion is 0.33% of only banks total assets. They could easily afford it, like many other banks.

Oh, and the other 295 boats were purchased with evil fiat money, right? Bitcoin is a scam, doge has done more good for the community in its short existence than bitcoin. Bitcoin only gets the news when an exchange is down, when a drug and hire-a-killer marketplace are closed, or when the price goes up or plummets. The idea behind bitcoin is a joke, 99% of people buy bitcoins because they want to make some quick cash, and nothing else.

Sure, and how many people exactly have profited from Bitcoin rise 2010-2013? a few dozen, maybe? Hahahahahahaha.
The fact is: Bitcoin went from $1200 to $300 and Litecoin from $50 to $3.

THat alone confirms how fake this news is. Facebook has been **banned in China since 2008**.
Also, there is **absolutely no mention of this on btcchina.com**. No other Bitcoin exchange mentions this. No other website or reliable news outlet mentions this.

12 x 5 = $60 per year.
If you owned 1 Bitcoin last year, you would have lost $900. No service fees, but no insurance either. And you have to do everything by yourself.

Major lie in your first sentence. 
BTC ATH: $1,242
BTC earlier this week: $260
1242 - 260 / 1242 x 100% = down 79%.
You're either a liar or extremely bad at math. Both are excellent reasons to ignore/disrespect anything you have to say about anything related to finance.

* 1 Bitcoin $300 - 1 Litecoin $2
* Chance of getting your Bitcoin wallet hacked is most likely 10 fold of chances of getting your Litecoin wallet hacked (because hackers target Bitcoin)
* Trading Bitcoin is a lot riskier than trading Litecoin. The following major Bitcoin companies/exchanges have been hacked or turned out to be a huge scam (just a few examples): MtGox - Bitstamp - Neo&amp;Bee. Major LTC exchanges, however, have not been targeted. 
So its cheaper than Bitcoin in many ways  (and faster. And mining it is also cheaper) :).
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:15:10
that's why they're poor. they should stop living from paycheck to paycheck. how silly of them to that!
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:05:58
Look at Coinmap. LTC is accepted at 10% of the places where Bitcoin is accepted and it's of course integrated with GoCoin and Snapcard. Bitcoin didn't have so much adoption and development in its 3rd year. It's also faster and cheaper than Bitcoin, so maybe a better entry point for people new to the crypto-currency world. 
Other +'s:
- It's creator is known.
- It's not associated with terrorism, fraud, etc. and not really a target despite its size.
I just wanted to hear your opinions, but it confirms what I already suspected: despite the fact that Bitcoin is associated with thousands of scams, is slower and has lost 80%+ of its value, it's not dying. But Litecoin apparently is.
Hehe. 
And Bitcoin has no practical use outside of trading either. Using Bitcoin in daily life is impractical, and I am sorry to burst your bubble, it will **never** work. The fact that large corporations can't even protect their funds is a confirmation that it will never be adopted. It will (most likely scenario) just fade into obscurity. Bitcoin is mainly used as an easy way to make money (its primary use; it is **not** used as a currency). Just look at it:
* The major Bitcoin companies: exchanges 
* Other major Bitcoin companies: payment processors, 90% of those who accept bitcoin convert it to fiat immediately, some have even decided to delist it because they had zero sales. 
* As long as there is no stability, it will not see wide spread adoption. Imagine the following extremely likely scenario: John Doe buys a chocolate bar. The chocolate bar costs $1, John Doe decides to pay with Bitcoin instead and pays 0.005 BTC. The next morning he finds out that his 0.005 BTC is now worth not $1, but $10. Now imagine the same scenario but with a $30,000 car.  
Major issues. 
It's not going to happen.

You're not some person on Reddit. You came out of a cunt thousands of miles away, probably many years before or after me. You most likely grew up in a different culture and country. But we just met.

omg no, i am a true bitcoiner (like mentioned before)
i am not going to post my bitcoin address, people could hack me if i did that
i have stored my bitcoin address in cold storage. if you want to see my bitcoin address you have to first login to my blockchain.info account and go to ''shielded addresses''. under shielded address you need to enter my 3 secret questions, password again, confirmation email and then 2 factor authentication code (the 2FA code is only send when you click on the confirmation email). the 2FA code is special, it's not authy, sms or google authenticator, but face recognition (new Yahoo! software, only selected ppl like me are allowed to use it). during configuration it takes a photo of your face and saves your picture. every time u want to login it scans your face, if it matches with the picture, it will display a unique code which will only be valid for 15 seconds. 
and only then the shielded bitcoin addresses is unshielded.
so sorry can't do that.

he cant be wrong because he is RICH and rich ppl dont make mistakes :)
i am glad i am one of the true and few early adopters. i will thank mister dreaper personally once bitcoin goes to $10k.
edit: sorry i think i was unclear. i didn't mean that i'll only thank mister draeper once bitcoin goes to $10k. mister dreper sorry , i apologize. i''ll always be thankful. you're an inspiration. i hope the bufet guy soon realizes how wrong he is. he thinks he knows everything simply because he has a lot of money. thats not how it works!

This is why bitcoin will never succeed. Someone purchases something once from a bitcoin-accepting store, and his order goes missing. He starts a topic about it on Reddit, and labels the owner &amp; the webstore as a SCAM. It gets massive upvotes, 71 upvotes against 8 downvotes. While there have been happy customers. But now, this store is already indexed in Google - together with many other BTC related stores - as a scam, so people will not purchase from this store in the future. They google its reliability, and see Reddit results in google. Another bitcoin related store destroyed. 
Goes hand-in-hand with Bitcoin's image as being a criminal currency!
Reddit moderators shouldn't allow such topics to be posted without evidence, this is really bad.
