You are forgetting that 1GH/s will be worth less in the future than it is today. If you keep mining contracts for any length of time it will be hard to get back what you initially spent because of this depreciation of value.
These contracts have been around since at least 2011/12.

I personally recommend 50btc, its stable, has good Uptime and only 3% PPS fee.
It is large now though (3.5TH) so those worried about 51% might consider smaller pools (IMHO its a little overblown problem, an attack of such nature would lower BTC price, counter-productive to profits even to those doing the attack).

mining is mainly a double round of SHA-256 at the moment. A) SHA-256 is not very QC vulnerable. B) one or both of the rounds is conceived as a replacement hash should SHA-256 ever become weak.

The cost to ship it to them I bore (this is typical in RMA process, but some companies cover both), but they shipped the replacement to me for free.

It does give a lot of samples of sha256 hash results with specific outputs. More importantly it puts a pretty big incentive to break it, at least partially. Who knows, it might be the NSA just testing their hash algo's :)

meh I approached it with a node.js instance. Its robust and fast.
Well its fast for a script, it takes me about 80ms to check a single phrase. Useful up to 100's of thousands, if you need to check more, you better go OpenCL.

1. it has to be 4 random words, or your entropy isn't right
2. depends fully upon the size of the dictionary used, a 5k dictionary is fully hackable
3. the 'stupid' passphrase test competition had 3-4 word combinations (repeats most of them), took about 2 weeks for people to crack them.

there will be 12TH from ASICMiner, and around 60TH from Avalon-ASIC batches 1-2, order estimates vary, but typical estimates are another 60TH from BFL. So expect something like 150-160TH network in beginning of April Timeline.
Based on those numbers expect a 5-6fold increase in network difficulty in that time.

We really need a more robust standard for brain wallets. The pass phrase should be hashed at least 10,000 times, making a single crack attempt take 10,000 longer without reducing the usability of it.
It doesn't solve the bad password problem, but lengthens the horizon until they become vulnerable.
Or you could just use non-standard methods, obscurity does add entropy.
@_date: 2013-05-04 04:44:11
Still profitable. Think 200% or more over power costs for good high end system, WITH the current price dip in mind.
@_date: 2013-03-07 23:38:55
Long story short:  
1. SHA256(password) = ECDSA private key  
2. Q = dG (ECDSA private key) = ECDSA public key  
3. Ripemd-160(ECDSA public key), prepend 0x00 = intermediate value  
4. SHA256(SHA256(intermediate value)), grab first 4 bytes = suffix  
5. append suffix to intermediate value and convert to base 58 =&gt; Bitcoin common form address (1xxx...)

Thats not quite how it works, there is lag in all things, especially mining (2 weeks). It will have a sustained effect on difficulty rather than the spikes as the network adapts, net effect a loss of unearned bitcoins for the customers either way.
@_date: 2013-03-05 22:55:17
two month ROI is not slow. In bitcoin mining it is typical to excpect 6month to 1 year ROI, so you're ahead of the curve.
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:14:24
Depends on dictionary size and what substitutions you use. You'd be surprised how little entropy common substitutions add due to human nature, do not use less than 8 random words.

whats the phrase?
@_date: 2013-04-20 18:39:17
Node.js supports C/C++ modules. There seems to be a lot of undue hate for something that acts as a fast and solid glue code.
An event-driven structure conveys for locking to be precisely defined in a module, and the interaction to be easily tiered allowing for a safely abstracted core to be accessed by scalable outer layers.

Double rounding increases security against successful partial cryptographical analysis such as a pre-image attack. There's always a trade-off.
@_date: 2013-02-14 17:42:56
The block you linked does not appear to be orphaned
 
Either way, normally the fees you pay almost ensures your transaction will be included in the next block, but even today 0 fee transactions generally get accepted and quickly.
Its a matter of waiting. Once you've sent a transaction it will eventually be included in a block, unless you send another conflicting transaction that gets received and placed into a block before the earlier one.

If most of the network consisted of AMD Gpus it would be accurate to say its 6.35k ops per hash, or half the hash rate that the article assumes. (500THash, but its not all GPUs anymore). 2flops per intop has always been an inaccurate assumption.
Now with ASICs making the equivalent case is much harder, since there are no potential flops in sight!

Only true if SHA-256 is uncrackable. If it is cracked even partially, your search space starts collapsing into something feasible.

Except that with bigger capital, you can acquire low-supply high-demand expensive ASICs, its also all time sensitive: a gold rush. Essentially the rich get richer quicker.
To even the ground, more, and importantly cheaper asics have to be available so that everyone can scale with their surplus income level. This requires additional effort from producers of ASICs, and what I'd wager is some strong belief in the benefits of decentralization of mining, which may run counter to profits in the short term.
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:47:48
Some users switch to litecoin mining the moment the difficulty jumps. This is because the difficulty adjustments are not in sync and litecoin profitability is significantly higher during the initial period after a difficulty jump.

and without a foreseeable price increase (x10 offset last time), this time GPU miners may fall into the unprofitable region (starting somewhere after a 5x rise in difficulty from current).
Even then though you will have miners who mine with the future bitcoin price in mind, which is currently unknowable.

its easier to remember something like 8-12 random words than 20 random characters, and the former has more entropy.

GPU mining is still as profitable in fiat as it was back pre-halving (November 2012), but yields significantly less BTC.
Will it still be profitable? Unless bitcoin prices keep rising as fast as they have so far, that is unlikely in the typical 6 month ROI period people judge mining projects.
Other factors to consider: price of the equipment, electricity price, stability, and heat output.

Well defined/optimized problems do not have this issue. Bitcoin is a case because each hash is independent. There are many parallel but chained problems that GPUs can handle, such as multi-variable solvers with millions of terms.

Their RMA process actually works well. I had a broken Jalapeno after about a month of it running normally and sent it in for RMA, they shipped a replacement within 3 days. The devices technically come with a lifetime warranty...

@_date: 2013-04-30 06:19:27
That's an overestimate. A double round of SHA 256 is 6.35k ops, so the multiplication factor is closer to 6.35
A stock clocked 7970 Ghz gives roughly 4Tflops (single precision), and typically yields 585MHs. 4000/585*98% ~= 6.7 which is close to ideal.
The overestimation came from 1intop=2flop, which isn't accurate on AMD gpus. Most of the network still consists of gpus, even more so in the past. So ~450petaflops is more accurate. With probably at least 50% being general purpose capable flops.
@_date: 2013-06-16 22:31:12
Back when there was a password cracking test by a researcher [Security Test: Hack my wallets!]( a lot of people built scripts to run through dictionary spaces for 3-4 words. After the fact we discussed the possibility and probability of creating a watchlist for common combinations.

This is useful for bruteforce analysis, but I highly suspect the pattern is visual, hence the png to start with.

At that number of characters, I can guarantee you it was not bruteforced, but lifted (either generating site or a keylogger).
Even with relatively bad entropy 22 characters is outside the realm of bruteforce generally (unless its repeat words...).
