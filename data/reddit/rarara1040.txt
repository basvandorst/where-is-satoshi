One of the 3 functions of money = a store of value.  
In addition to a unit of account and a medium of exchange.  Fiat currency FAILS as a store of value.

Those in debt who can repay bondholders (bagholders) with inflated dollars worth less benefit from inflation. Almost every Western government is massively in debt.  What monetary policy have deeply indebted governments without the political will to raise taxes chosen throughout history? Inflation

This is nonsense.  If people postponed all purchases due to being able to get "more" or a better quality product for the same amount of money then no one would purchase cell phones or television.  
You know in 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years from now there will be a cell phone which is better for the same price, or does the same basic features for less money.

Keynes is worshiped by economists who work for the government, central banks, and quasi-governmental institutions such as the IMF and World Bank because he provides the ideology to allow unlimited government fiat money printing.  You will not get the truth from listening to intellectual bodyguards of the state.

Those repaying fixed rate nominal debt benefit from inflation.  For example someone who owns real estate and can raise rents with inflation but repays bondholders in inflated dollars benefits massively from inflation.

Thank you for your response.  You are pointing out the holding period utility of an item matters, which I agree with.  
My question to you is what is driving the price of homes from $500k to $450k?  Is it technology making building a new home (substitute good) cheaper?  Or the bursting of an unsustainable debt fueled speculative bubble?  Important to think about imo.

Gold has historically been a better store of value - even for 1000 years.  Fiat currency allows the government to steal people's wealth without corresponding legislation to create and implement a specific tax.

Yes.  
No one has countered my point regarding deflation in the price of cell phones postponing purchases - just down-voted LOL.

With the govt making moves to ban large cash amounts I would not be suprised to see criminalization or reporting requirements for Bitcoin in India soon. The Leviathan marches on

My mistake:  
"The private equity partners I spoke with laid out what they see as the most probable scenario explaining the growth of his IRA: When it came time for Romney to invest his portion of the $1 million needed (in our hypothetical example) for a Bain leveraged-buyout, instead of using money in his bank account, he used the money -- the $30,000 -- he had put in his IRA. Where once he had $30,000 in cash in his IRA, now he would have had something he valued at $30,000 but that was really his portion of the "carried interest" in the deal; if the deal worked out, the IRA could quickly be worth a lot more than $30,000." per:

I heard Mitt Romney interested in his own company within his IRA? Or maybe even Roth IRA

Yes but not because of electricity price. Supportive local government and strong regulatory framework, low taxation, strong privacy laws, educated workforce, very safe.

I didn't see that but yeah some countries have 0 short or long term capital gains. Singapore and Switzerland for instance.

Eliminating cash certainly makes Bitcoin more attractive for anonymous transactions
