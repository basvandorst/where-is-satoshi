The scoff he gives at the end when he asks if the Newsweek gossip columnist wrote all this gives us an idea of how he feels about all this. 
I'm getting the feeling that quotes were taken out of context.

Great news. This is just another step in the right direction.

Whenever someone asks me about Bitcoin, I point them in the direction of Stefan Molyneux and Andreas Antonopoulos. Both have a way with words that make complex ideas easier to grasp. 
Seaman has been very good about getting relevant guests on lately, but I have a hard time listening to him speak. Some of his thoughts are well intentioned, but they come across as the thoughts of a typical angry high schooler. 
I don't mean to be too harsh because he is getting better. I just hope that he works on his interviewing skills.

Not in every state unfortunately.

The dollar's stability is tied to the supposed stability of the US government. Why is the US so stable? Well we have a lot of bombs and guns.

When I contacted Simple in regards to Bitcoin, they said that they are "neutral". I've been using them ever since and have yet to have a problem.

I can't wait until they get legitimate competition so coinbase has to step up their game.

Perhaps god awful is too strong a term, but I'm referencing the rigidness of the current tax system we have in the United States. 
It's slow to adopt to change, especially a change as significant as the rise of crypto currencies. 
I think it's a pipe dream to think that the US government will have a favorable tax outlook on crypto currencies without massive and quick adoption; at least in the short term.

Andreas gave a great talk as always. He's the type of voice this community really needs.
On a side note, the QR code in the top right corner was there for the entire hour and a half. That just comes across as tacky.
I'm ok with watermarks and things of that nature, but the QR code is really distracting and unnecessary.

If interest rates are artificially low for too long, then you give access to essentially free funds to a large group of people. If everyone has access to those dirt cheap funds, then you run into inflation. 
Here's a definition from [Investopedia](


I didn't think I would have to spell out the relationship between interest rates and inflation, but you learn something new everyday.

Why are you asking for donations?
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:03:24
This is definitely on the hyperbolic side of things.


I couldn't help but chuckle. This reads like freshman in college just learned what hyperinflation was and tried to draw connections where there weren't any.
We all know that quantitative easing will cause inflation sooner or later, but to see the US Dollar collapse so incredibly and so quickly is not going to happen anytime soon barring a zombie apocalypse or thermonuclear war.

Yup, you beat me to it.

That restriction only exists as long as a new user hasn't been verified. 
Once you get past the first verification, then you are able to buy bitcoin while you have a purchase pending.
@_date: 2014-01-13 15:15:20
Fair enough.
Artificially low interest rates over a prolonged period of time could lead to the type of spending that causes prices to rise too quickly. That's what worries me.

I got the first one! Thanks for the cool game! 
Now excuse me while I report this to the IRS ;-)

Bitcoinity.org is another option.

I'm just genuinely curious why it's ok to ask for donations at the end of a post on reddit. I would equate it to walking around a city park asking people for donations simply because you told a story.

From what I understand, Coinbase allowed for the purchase and selling of Bitcoin through the app without giving Apple any cut. Normally Apple charges 30% for all transactions that take place within the App Store. 
Whether you agree with Apple's policy or not, it is their store. They can choose to charge whatever they want, and if you don't want to pay up, then you can't be surprised when your app gets pulled.

It's comforting to know that the alleged investors saw what a piece of trash Karpeles is and blew the whistle.

I could be wrong, but I'm finding these arbitrary limits on how much I can buy in a single day to be something Coinbase is imposing in order to cover their own asses. That's completely understandable from a business owner's perspective, but it's frustrating to me as a customer. I'm ultimately going to go to whoever gives me the most freedom when I buy Bitcoin, especially since freedom is what Bitcoin is all about. 
I completely understand why it takes so long for me to actually get my Bitcoin. Coinbase has to deal with a BS legacy banking system, which is helping the jump to Bitcoin feel that much easier. Arbitrary limits though? That's where I stop understanding. 
This is just one more hurdle that I have to jump over.

Why are you asking for donations?
Edit - I guess he stopped asking once someone called him out on it. It's tacky. Don't do it.

What if, for example, the US dollar suffered severe depreciation? Our money is worth more, so is it subject to a capital gains-like tax? 
I feel like the problem is that people are trying to label bitcoin one thing or another when in reality it is something completely new.
Our god awful tax system was not built to handle this, and an overhaul is in order. Unfortunately, I have a feeling the changes are going to be more draconian that any of us would like. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:51:35
Those costs are passed onto the customer.

I hate it when I can't analize something. It's a pain in the butt.
