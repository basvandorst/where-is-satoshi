Are you planning to use the PNB Account you open in the USA here in the Philippines?
Because if your gonna use it here.  The account that they will be opening will actually be a Philippine Bank Account which you can't link to coinbase.

I think physical cards for bitcoin is the key to it's mainstream success. Average non-tech people need something to hold in their hands to realized they have something.  Like a debit card but the funds are in bitcoins or better yet in a phone wallet.  I think it's being done but not enough to be a standard.
It's easier to explain to average people.
"Hey grandpa just show this to the Walmart Cashier and they will debit your account instantly."
Of course the you'll need the infrastructure to back it up.
The swipe machine in stores, Atm Machines that could convert your Bitcoins into Fiat instantly. Because for it to exist at the mass level, at this point, converting it to Fiat currencies is a must since not all store accepts bitcoins.
Which leads me to another question, can Bitcoin exists in the masses of a Third World Country?  With all the gadgets you need to use bitcoins. Most of us here don't even have a computer.

I was verified at Bitstamp using Phil. Postal Id. So it's likely that you'll get verified.  Once your Bitcoins are in your Bitstamp account, you can sell it (converted to USD) then request a withdrawal.  You must provide a Philippine Bank account to be able to receive the money.

Thank you i just sign up for an account, there is quite a few sellers.

try BitStamp.net or localbitcoins.com

They owe you an explanation dude.  I worked in a bank for six years and if customers submit proper identification and the bank knows the source of the money it should be good to go anywhere in the world.  
The Anti Money Laundering Law was implemented to track transactions exceeding $10k total transactions within the day and transactions that are suspicious(like funding someone in Pakistan).  Other specifics regarding the AML i don't know.
So if it's $2k and they know where the funds are going to a legit entity they should give it a go.
Or maybe they suspect your transaction to be illicit in nature.
TL;Dr - they probably don't trust your transaction or Bitstamp
