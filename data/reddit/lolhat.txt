Which is why I suggest that he took precautionary measures. Surely he doesn't use brainwallets, so he could just put the private keys in a bank vault.

You do know the World consists of other countries than US, right? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:00:25
There's not.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:25:16
What does that have to do with a potential risk, that needs to be dealt with because you own a lot of stuff a thief would like to steal? 
Don't get me wrong, but reading through the comments in the Satoshi Newsweek thread, it seemed most people thought that owning a lot of BTC, didn't mean you should have to protect yourself.

And thats why you always need to check your quotes before agreeing to them.

Wow, so many assumptions and personal opinions in that statement. If you think the Danish welfare model was build om low taxes you really don't know much about Denmark.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:00:55
I don't get it.
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:12:42
I get that. But that doesn't explain why so many are exactly 0.000055 btc
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:11:26
Makes sense. Could you link to a source describing this, please?
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:38:08
And why wouldn't he have?
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:09:50
This is correct. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:14:30
Yes, the initial 50 btc can't be spend. However other incoming tx are perfectly valid to spend from that address. You even write it yourself :) 
@_date: 2014-03-12 11:21:40
What is great about Denmark in your opinion? And in what way was this greatness build through low taxes?
Yes, I think the welfare system has proven it's ability to build a great society. If it should remain unchanged in the future is more questionable.
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:15:40
Where can you see the hashrate "live"?
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:09:59
So in what way do you think the society is great, again?
The Danish welfare system has been developed throughout the last century - even stretching back to 1890 - the year the first official health care system was implemented in Denmark.
With all due respect, I don't think you know your Danish history that well.

Damn autocorrect... Was at the groceries...

Addresses starting with 3 are multisig addresses.

What do you do with the seed? I might be mis-informed, but doesn't a Trezor mean you have to write down a list of secret words? What do you do with that list?
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:35:37
I'll put it in the post, thanks! 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:07:58
RemindMe! 28 days "lol"
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:50:45
I somewhat agrees with you. But if stuff like this can't be posted in the bitcoin sub, I don't see where else I should post.
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:20:42
Never seen them in Denmark
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:59:31
Absolutely right. Will edit post as soon as possible. Will the mods change the post title? 
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:11:56
I guess that is very situational. 2 Bitcoins may not represent a large portion of your net worth but to others it might represent 30% (not that I would suggest storing 30% of your net worth in such a volatile currency).
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:26:22
This is what I've done, but there's still that itching feeling when filling up my cold storage address with coins that I am not 100% cure, my private key is right.
This surely can't be the best method.
@_date: 2016-03-16 13:56:10
Lol. Add all you wan't - when only that much can be stored in the chain it'll die off if nothing's done. Which luckily is sort'of happening.
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:50:32
I'm using Blockchain.info but it would be better to use armory I guess... 
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:53:59
I'd rather spend two hours doing what my guide suggested, save the money and learn something on the way - you prefer to buy a Trezor. Each to their own, I guess.
Like I wrote in the OP: there are many other ways to store bitcoins, and this is just one of them.
If you have - let's say 200 bitcoins - would you seriously just "store it like anything else"? I know I wouldn't.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:59:00
I don't claim that. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:20:14
They can, and if you can't trust them, I sugget doing 3-of-4 or 3-of-5 instead.
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:16:30
Cheers. Didn't know bitaddress had the "wallet details" tab.
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:43:27
Only the correction. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:09:48
You are absolutely right, and I am looking forward to the day when that is the case.
However, when you are your own bank, I don't think it is unreasonable that it takes more work than using a simple application (not that I doubt that will be the case in the future).
Furthermore, just as it was immensely technical to send an e-mail in the early internet days, it might be difficult to secure bitcoins now, but easier as development happens.
@_date: 2015-01-21 09:01:26
My bad. Thanks for clearing that out. A Venn diagram would be usefull :)
@_date: 2016-03-16 16:18:51
Great point, really.

@_date: 2017-11-13 21:19:39
Can you maybe post links to where this is stated in r / btc? It would certainly make your post more credible... Right now you are only pouring gasoline on the fire with these undocumented statements.
What I'd like to know is, why aren't fees being discussed here? It's a huge thing many other places, but in this sub there's radio silence about it. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:44:34
Seriously, why downvote this? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:09:39
Well it goes both ways doesn't it? My point is, nobody and everybody are to blame.
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:42:58
Yeah, I know what I am looking at - that's the point :-)
It still seems VERY shallow to allow this...
