I agree it seems to be an inevitable result of having positions of power. There seems to be about only two main solutions:
1. Don't allow people to seek redress (lobbying).
2. Don't have positions of power.
I don't think there's any kind of workable solution in between.

Well I've discovered the problem. Neoconservatism has a well established definition, and it isn't what you're talking about. Google is your friend.

Libertarianism IS a rejection of those systems, by any rational definition. But you seem to make up your own definitions as you go, so there's no real way to communicate with you. I might use words that billions understand but that you believe is the opposite.

I would really like to know your definition or criteria of 'neocon'.
@_date: 2014-07-06 06:00:32
For what it's worth, I haven't down voted you. You've gotten your political labels a bit messed up, but otherwise seem to have a common complaint about folks like the Koch bros. If you just didn't use that term (incorrectly), the cross-linking wouldn't have happened. 
If neocon has changed to mean what you say it does, then folks like Cheney need a new label. It is certainly possible the term could change meaning, but it hasn't happened yet.

They need a Best Buy-style queue.

Lobbyists are a legitimate way to seek redress, which is a guaranteed right in the Constitution.
Of course lobbying can turn into corruption, but that's a function of people's ethics. If politicians and lobbyists are unethical, they will engage in corruption.

You are stuck in your preconceived notions that there must *always necessarily* be positions of power which can be seized or filled or whatever. If people's wants and needs are met by a market and they have become accustomed to not having anyone in charge of them, then they will have a bad taste in their mouth toward anyone trying to rebuild a new infrastructure of authority like the government of old.
I'm talking about a society in which government has been made obsolete, where it is a foregone conclusion that it isn't necessary or desirable to establish, provide, and fund various solutions to social problems via institutionalized initiations of coercion.


So just a *little* tool for evil is okay? Why not stop giving evil people tools?

As an on again, off again SC2 follower, what did TB do to piss some of you guys off? He can be a little annoying, but otherwise alright.

Okay, cool. Sorry that went right over my head.

Who wins the presidency in 2016?

This is absolutely incorrect. A bubble can reform or recur.

I'm not perfectly familiar with exactly what humanism entails. Is it kind of like Rawlsian social justice ideals with a utilitarian bent?
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:32:01
Any constraints on that direct democracy? So like a constitutional direct democracy?
@_date: 2013-07-26 15:49:21
So salty.

Wait, were you being serious?

NaNi fighting!!
@_date: 2013-08-07 14:15:58
I personally feel a more direct democracy wouldn't fix anything, that it would be prone to the same kinds of failings. However, I appreciate your candor, here, and your open mindedness. Sorry for the downvotes you're getting.

Get a little solar panel. 
Wait, is there a positive ROI on *those?*

There's only a vacuum when you remove something quickly. If government services are steadily replaced, one day it could be gone and no one would notice or care.
But that's beside the point. You could even have governments around, and if said governments did not interfere with goods distribution, it would become more efficient.


And when you provide for these awful people a way to control others, they will inevitably seize it. Better to have a society that doesn't tolerate archons, like the despots to which you refer; they stand a much better chance of resisting tyranny.
