General info may be the way to go. No matter what link we actually put in the video, people will probably just end up Googling it anyway.

**Any ideas?**
Live action or animation? TV Commercial or web ads? Let's hear them all

I like it. We can do a version with students, travelers, e-commerce, etc. and it will all be uniform.

Awesome! There's been a lot of feedback and I think web ads are the way to go. Thanks for your interest!

I agree! I think small business owners would be the most beneficial.

*Bitcoins: For Everyone*
Target being small business owners (tired of credit card fees and complicated bank fees.)
Other targets being college students. Easy way to send/receive money from friends/family/work?
We don't want to sell it as an investment. We need people USING Bitcoins.

Thanks for the feedback! 
**Where would you feature this commercial?**
 
- Not sure yet, honestly. Youtube advertising may be the way to go now that I think about it. Not sure how Youtube would feel about that.
**Have you done this before?** 
- Nope... I have a background in video editing and commercial graphic design, but not actual commercials.
**What's your target audience?**
 - In my opinion, college students and people ages 18-25
**What website will you send them to?**
 - Not entirely sure. The group would either make a new one, or the group would vote on one to use, assuming we have permission from the entity behind the website.
