No, I asked you if it stopped the cocaine trade. Did it?
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:34:01
Did eventually catching Escobar stop the cocaine trade?
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:50:25
You are arguing against decentralization by proposing that this will stop drug trade.

Phase-out? They will just pay off whatever officials need to be paid and business will continue as usual.

1. This is true. But unpersuasive as the same argument could be made against *any* encryption *anywhere*. 
2. In what way has it restricted anything? This is why I keep harping on the question of whether or not the cocaine trade has in any way been impeded. Do you have empirical data to demonstrate your point? Lastly, it has nothing to do with being “secret money,” it has to do with decentralization to disengage from the overreaching tentacles of government and central banks. There’s a difference.

1. Cash does not come with records. If you’re referring to his money laundering activities, why would that be any less visible with bitcoin?
2. If none of this stops the underlying criminal activity, why should anyone surrender their own freedoms to allegedly aid some lost cause pursuit against it?

Of course. Criminals will use whatever is most convenient for them. But it’s not a valid argument against bitcoin, in my opinion, just as criminals conducting billions of dollars in illegal transactions using the US dollar is not an argument against the US dollar.

Is this an Onion article?

This presumes that centralized currencies have been effective in this regard, which they have clearly not been.

Ah, well, my mistake. I'm only familiar with the current implementation, I wasn't aware of this alternate proposal. (And obviously I should read up on block weight.)
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:47:51
Good luck with that.

That's not how SegWit works. It isn't a "discount," it's a different way of storing the signatures in a transaction.

Money printing? Please clarify. Also, the fact that somebody makes money "on the way up" and someone else loses out on a crash does not ipso facto make it "fraud." If it did, Wall Street would not exist.

Looks and talks like Rick Hoffman.

The US dollar is used by criminals. Pablo Escobar built a billion dollar cocaine empire without having access to bitcoin.

Any bank's opinion on Bitcoin should be taken with an appropriate grain of salt.

The average joe has mostly moved on to buying the latest pump and dump trashcoins because "it's really cheap at $0.02 a coin and will surely go up 1000% really soon."
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:02:15
Yeah, because anyone who is doing something illegal is going to tell the call center person they contracted the "where did your funds come from" phone call out to the truth. Yet more congressional stupidity.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:00:40
This Novogratz guy's opinion is just as useless as a Jim Cramer proclamation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:33:51
What's confusing about it? I've been questioned by the bank before because of these asinine regulations you mentioned. I initially ignored them until they froze my accounts, at which point I gave in and spoke to a call center person clearly sitting on another continent who rattled off infuriatingly invasive questions about the source of my money. I answered honestly because I don't do anything illegal. But if I were conducting illicit activities, why would I tell the bank that when they come asking? 
As I said, it's congressional stupidity.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:13:51
Who cares about some stupid regulation? How would they ever enforce that nonsense?
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:20:26
Another moron who doesn’t get it. It isn’t about “not leaving a trail,” it’s about taking control away from centralized authorities like banks and governments. Only an idiot thinks this isn’t a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:14:21
How would you propose to trustlessly timelock any amount of paper currency for this to work?

LN is specifically architected so you don't need to wait for on-chain confirmations. [These guys explain it better]( than I can.
