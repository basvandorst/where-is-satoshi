its wonderful that these people help us by burning their fiat paid electricity confirming not only new payments but the whole 99000000 historic payments.
this monumental PoW wasted energy further highlights the dominant position and strength of double spend resistance of Bitcoin the First crypto curency.

fee won't hit $10 soon because
a) demand will move to altcoins
b) mining is subsidied. mining expenses are how much? slightly less than subsidy e.g. &lt; 25BTC /block. (about$11k)
they will mine full blocks because get more in fees. so $10 means the cheapest fee in block will be $10. since the block is full there's 2200 transactions with slightly more say $11 fee. so the fees in block are worth $24200.
so somebody (group of people X) is paying to miner  $24k to confirm their transactions.
Wouldn't it be smarter if group of people X just buy a mining device and confirm their own transactions for $24K in electricity prices (they get back their fees or set it to zero and mine or whatever). And they (group X) will get additional subsidy (free money) $11K from the block??? and their transactions will have statistical priority over chinese ones???
by group of people X replace any bunch of people who know ahead they will be using bitcoin heavily in the next year and it makes sense to de facto lower their fees and boost their payments confirmation time?

relax mate as an american (guessing) even in debts youre still in a beter position in life than most people. it could be much worse you coul be in jail etc.
unless they going after you. hehe.
but yes i know that randomness is terrible and there are many thinking flaws that make us think we can predict shit etc. thats why many people play slots machines, poker, betting etc. the whole mindset i must keep repeating doing it again I know that man.
my losses were limited i won 1btc in poker then lost it.
then again 1btc on satoshi dice but again lost it :D back to zero
if only i knew when is the best moment to stop :D that is the most difficult question :D equals to knowing what card comes next.
and there is more there are pyramid games, shitty altcoins its very dangerous.
actually u can be happy you lost to bitcoin people at least you supported the ecosystem :D you could have lost that at establishment casino :D
take care

I think the ECDSA is not a killer. P2SH keeps the pubkeys hidden until the payment, at which point even polynomial time exploit would be racing with the miners, so in worst case the theft problem reduces to double spend.
Keeping few honey pot rich "Satoshi's" addresses was a brilliant idea to expose potential ECDSA breacher.
We the rest can split funds between many addresses and sleep happily.

most insurgent organizations currently lack the skills necessary to deploy a Coin.
One of the main technological barriers for a non-state actor to deploy a 
Coin would be the expertise and general capability necessary to develop 
and deploy both the currency and the means to transact with it.
users’ trust in new currencies tends to be low. the best time to target a Coin
would be during this initial period: trust in the currency may be at a minimum,
the skill of cyber defenders may also be at an all-time low, and overall
sensitivity to the stability and success of the currency may be very high.
an individual transaction might be identified by examining the IP addresses of the users
thereby revealing the user’s entire transaction history.
de-anonymizing Bitcoin users employing Tor is possible given the current manner in which Bitcoin is configured.
Coin may be a target for the affected nation-state and its allies (including the United States); because a Coin may be 
perceived as a national security threat, such as when a Coin undermines 
state-controlled currencies or is used as a means of support for criminals or terrorist groups.
Potential attacks:
* DDoS attacks.
* attacks against the underlying infrastructure.
* zero-day vulnerabilities.
* theft of currency, as occurred against Mt. Gox.
* shutting off or strongly filtering the Internet.
* denying access to digital-wallet services and mining services.
* exceed the computational strength that would otherwise secure the system.
* Goldfinger attack - introducing deep forks, rejecting other miner’s blocks.
* disallow certain users of the currency.
* undermine faith in the currency.
* corrupting the mining pools.
* hack several mining pools.
* weaponry for a direct assault attack against the currency sponsors.
* DDoS, spear phishing - degrading a Coin system.
* Attacking exchanges.
* Attacking exchanges or other more centralized cyber services.
* compromises systems that have access to the keys for user accounts.
* compromises the users systems to steal currency.
* rules for currency generation and transaction state and its validation.
* exploit authority servers and essentially crash the currency - orchestrated attack that involves insiders .
* target high-net-worth individuals.
* randomly target average citizens to sow distrust.
* zero-day exploits against exchanges and wallets as well as cell-phone applications.
* fake permissions and certificates to install applications that subvert or spy on user.
* subtly changing the software implementations of key cryptographic functionalities.
* supply-chain attacks against the underlying infrastructure.
* subverting the implementation of the software.
* target cell phones or other hardware including computers.
* target special-purpose hardware used for mining, and corrupt them before delivery.
* infecting hardware and in particular the special-purpose hardware that performs cryptographic tasks.
* break cryptographic standards.
* severe degradation of confidence in a Coin.
* employing agents to assume the roles of key Coin personnel such as software developers.
* to bribe or otherwise co-opt such personnel.
* high-tiered opponent would be able to successfully attack any target of interest in cyberspace if enough resources were invested.
* high-tiered opponents may not wish to conduct attacks that reveal their sophistication.
* target those properties of a Coin that would most increase its acceptance, most notably transaction anonymity, security, and availability.

If fork happens, it's going to be a spectacular theatre.
So call your family, prepare popcorn, select your favorite branch to cheer for.

keeping record of some ledger is not a difficult thing at all.
agreeing which ledger is the correct one is.
*user who spent his funds will claim he didnt (claiming the old ledger is valid)
*users who manage the ledger deposits (newly created value on ledger) can give themselves
value from thin air, devalving other user's funds.
bitcoin inovation is the use of single method (Proof of Work) to solve both these problems.

my point is that people who simply hodl, do not need to have the app enabled. 
on the other hand, real users should be hid behind a private bitcoin node
either way, from the global perspective it should look like there's just a handful of nodes.
once the big bitcoin crackdown starts, the nodes can simply disappear in the deep net, and be unaffected.
@_date: 2016-01-04 11:45:11
no, Satoshi did, by imposing the 1mb cap. This limit is respected by all the users on the Bitcoin network. Noone had attempted to mine a larger block ever since.

listen up bro, the network is producing 300 kb blocks! so there is no demand whatsoever! we are at 30% of our total capacity of 1MB blocks!
once there are  full 1mb blocks packed with large fees and commerce overflow to Doge or Ltc that would be convincing, until then - Satoshi is right, it was just some kind of spam. And spam belongs to where?

if fork happens at all, it will last only few hours. In the end, one chain wins. regardless of the result, your coins will be on the winning chain.
coins on the destroyed chain will become unspendable. (because only a fool would mine the losing chain)
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:09:22
Let me tell you a most realistic story:
Your coins will exist on both branches (same amounts).
1. The strong fork block time will be about  20 minutes. These Coins can be moved as usual.
2. The weak fork block time will be about 30 minutes, 40 minutes and grows to infinity minutes as miners leave the Titanic.
3. In about a hour, the weak fork funds effectively become frozen.
Alternative scenario (the weak side modifies difficulty so their blocks are mined quickly).
1. The strong fork block time will be about  20 minutes. Coins can be moved as usual.
2. The weak fork block time will be about  20 minutes. Coins can be moved as usual.
3. The weak fork will mine huge quantities of weak fork coins. They will mine 25 weak BTC every minute, second or even faster.
4. The weak fork coins will exceed 21 million BTC
5. The weak fork coins end like Zimbabwe dollars
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:35:03
yes but the coins on the losing chain will be frozen (all miners stop mining it). the losing chain (Classic) will be destroyed.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:19:16
@_date: 2016-01-02 14:07:16
oh no call satoshi to deploy the secret scaling upgrade
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:56:26
No. The minority chain will be destroyed within 2 hours.
Once the miners on the weak chain realize what a grave mistake they made, they will all hop to the strong chain.
@_date: 2016-01-03 22:34:24

No matter what proposal wins (big blocks / status quo). The fork will not be permanent.
The weak chain will be abandonned in a few hours.

@_date: 2016-01-12 18:54:23
the full chain is 61 GB. But the download time is just a fraction of the time of the subsequent blockchain validation (20 hours?).
@_date: 2016-01-04 12:06:42
the technology is solid, 1mb limit strong, that explains these fud campaigns. it's cheaper to just convince people that Bitcoin will fail instead of actually crash it.

a cute nick bro
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:36:11
the different ledgers are simply different copies of the "same" ledger.
the copies may be different, because:
- one is older, or one is counterfeit
In a Proof of Work system with programmable hardware, multiple chains cannot operate, since anybody can jump and disrupt the weak chain, unless the weak chain itself is checkpointed on the strongest chain (perhaps using RBF).
@_date: 2016-01-03 19:33:59
I belive you are right. In fact the rise from 200 $ to 400 $ could be precisely that. If the price is going to double on every reward halving, this could mean only one thing: Satoshi was a genius.
@_date: 2016-01-04 03:47:58
once your bitcoin is settled to the longest chain, why stay online?
pretty much only people needing full time full nodes are miners themselves - oh wait, pool operators.
@_date: 2016-01-03 20:58:09
you're right. miners actually have a veto power by not mining shit proposals. Shit means blocks that would lead to a crash of the system, or weakening the quality of the system.
the users vote on features mainly by using them. The satisfaction directly defines what is the longest valid chain from the user's point of view.
The most energy burning blockchain has the best qualities in terms of doublespend resistance, reorganisation resistance, data checkpointing.
Other chains may serve as a capacity overflow areas. Once the fee level
