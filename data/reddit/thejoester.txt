Ugh. My friends, my son, and I have all gotten into bitcoin and we will often discuss and share information and what we have learned since we last spoke. My father-in-law will always interrupt to make sure he points out that it’s “make believe” and “it’s a bubble that will bust any day”.
He knows absolutely NOTHING about what bitcoin or crypto currency is, but insists on injecting his opinions about it every chance he gets.

He basically thinks it’s a big Ponzi scheme, I’ve given up even trying to discuss it at all because he’s not interested in learning anything only about giving his opinion.

I tried that, in order to purchase through GDAX I have to put funds into my USD wallet on Coinbase. While there is no fees its been almost two weeks and still hasn't cleared on coinbase :( cleared from my bank right away.

Advice needed here. I am also fed up with coinbase and my Ledger Nano S is on its way and should be here soon. 
I want to move off of Coinbase and onto another exachange. I started signing up for cex.io but the process is a bit tedious not to mention they want me to send them my SSN, pictures of my IDs and documents with my address on them. I get the security reasons but I do not want to go through all that only to discover the same issues I am having with Coinbase. 
I am looking for advice on exchanges that: (1)is Segwit ready / deployed,
(2) doesn't take FOREVER to transfer funds (on Coinbase I initiated a transfer to the USD wallet almost two weeks ago and it is STILL PENDING with no response from support.), and (3) has lower fees
Any advice or recommendations?

Is there a list somewhere if exchanges that give you forked coins?

Ok so as a newbie to this who has my bitcoins on coinbase, where should I move them if I want to make sure to get B2X equal to my BTC?

I feel like this is totally my fault for buying at 7K
