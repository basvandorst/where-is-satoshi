I'm embarrassed to say I don't know how they were delivered. I believe I downloaded a file that contained the Bitcoin and received a long code with letters and  Does that make any sense?

You're dead on I know ZERO about BTC. I bought them after watching a video on YouTube years ago. I even went to a website where they gave me 0.1BTC for free. I appreciate your patience and thank you for your explanation and the link to learn more.

Is the copay app wallet fine to let my btc sit during this process? Also will any btc on mybitcoinwallet paper wallet be affected?

I still had the laptop in the garage. He removed the hard drive and was able to retrieve the btc. He said he had to purchase something to get it to reboot then he data mined?? for 16 hours and found them. Sorry I'm not tech savvy at all and I don't really understand how he did what he did. But I still had the hard drive in my possession, albeit in the garage and covered in dust...I'm sure he'd be glad to do the same for you if you still have your old computer...for half of course...lol, what I paid

I've got a wallet at blockchain.com and Coinbase. Are these also not safe?
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:03:52
Absolutely! I'm very grateful

I bought 5 btc off eBay for $80 years back. Computer crashed and I threw it out in the garage and completely forgot about the btc. After price went over $1000 I remembered my purchase and felt sick for not keeping up with them. Some guy at work said he might be able to find them for me. Long story short, he did!!! 5.26 btc!!! Of course when he said he could find them i opened my big mouth and said I'll give you half if you do, haha. So there is hope for those of you with btc on an old hard drive somewhere!

Yes...if I transfer what I have on Coinbase to a paper wallet that I purchased on eBay. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:35:03
Thanks...I bought the paper wallet with btc already loaded. The private key is sealed

I plan on it! The crazy part about this whole ordeal is that I most definitely would have sold them after a 100 or 200% gain if I had access to them. Like you said I had already written those off so 1 btc will be going to both of my kids in the future.
