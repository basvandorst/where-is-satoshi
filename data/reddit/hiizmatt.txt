Buy Ethereum, as Bitcoin rises, all others do as well. Plus Eth is a great cryptocurrency with a bright future and A LOT of support

Could bounce at around 3500 though off a trend line

The Daily/Weekly RSI shows Bitcoins will be overbought at around 3500-3600 as well.

I feel the same but I also personally think that it might dip a little further if it does

There is a 2 1/2 year long ascending trend line on the Bitcoin charts. It has not broke that trend once, Bitcoin will most likely never go under $1300 again. If you're long term, hold. Learn Technical analysis as well if you haven't already, it's extremely important and you can make A LOT of money if you become skilled enough. Took three months to learn for me.

The ignorance is real..

It's malware

I feel that from what I see from my technical analysis of the chart, that something is clearly going to happen relatively soon, the trend is either going up, or down. Either way If/when Segwit is activated I think it also might spike before the activation, followed by a big drop because people selling on hype, which will possibly cause panic selling.

Yeah it's definitely malware

So helpful ��
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:33:45
Yeah its a fairly big possibility that it will, I plan on holding a good amount and keeping some in USDT/Tether to buy more when/if it drops. thanks for your opinion ����
