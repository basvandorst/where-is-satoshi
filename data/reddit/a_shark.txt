mining will also be lucrative enough for it to be done. even as the amount of bitcoins per block gets less, computing power and bandwidth gets cheaper etc. 
the more interesting question is about the nodes. over time though the mining is supposed to get a little less lucrative, and the operation of nodes is supposed to become more lucrative. nodes are there to receive your transaction messages and make sure they get to all the miners ho make the blocks. for each transaction that ends in a block, the node also gets a small amount of the transaction fee that you pay with every transaction. in the beginning of bitcoin, transaction fees were virtually zero (0.005 BTC when 1 BTC was &lt; 1$). all the nodes where operated voluntarily by the developer community, without real profit. now that there is a much larger amount of transactions, those nodes can't recall process, so that people have to wait long. however transaction with higher fees have priority, because the node makes more money. and since there are too many transactions now, there is competition in transaction fees (when you send a transaction, you can choose your transaction fee yourself). therefore the fees get higher, and slowly commercial nodes start to operate and take care of bottleneck in transaction processing. transactions will then get faster again. 
i'll find it interesting to watch if the nodes will be able to finance itself as well as the miners do.

you are lying. 
25% inflation means that the same product costs 1.25 times as much, for example a chocolate bar for $1 would instead cost $1 * 1.25 = $1.25. 
so so after another 4 month of the same inflation, the product would cost $1 * 1.25 = $1.5625 and after a whole year it would cost $1 * 1.25 * 1.25 * 1.25 = $1.953125. A price rising from $1 to $1.95 is an inflation rate of 95%.

since you're interested i'll also explain the other half of the bitcoin protocol, which is more simple. transactions. 
bitcoins are held in "addresses". each address is actually an RSA-"public key" which also has a corresponding RSA-"private key". you can think of a "private key" as the password. it allows you to sign messages with a digital signature, meaning you can send messages to the bitcoin network, and they will know that the message was sent by the owner of the address. a transaction is a message saying something like "i send 0.123 bitcoins to address 1asdfasdfasdf", signed with the "private key". so the bitcoin reads this message, knows that it is from the adress 1abcabcabc and transfers 0.123 bitcoins from 1abcabcabc to 1asdfasdfasdf. a block is nothing but a collection of signed messages, most of them transactions. by making the block and distributing it, the network is distributing the transactions.

I don't think that's true. 
If you learn about the structure of Wikipedia, you will find that most of the content on Wikipedia originates from mainstream newspapers, as those are considered reliable sources. Most prolific Wikipedia Editors try not to be influenced by their personal opinions, and to only follow the rules that Wikipedia lays on them. And those rules say that mainstream newspapers are right, therefore "information" sourced by mainstream newspapers may not be deleted. 
If a Wikipedia article is hostile to Bitcoin, then that reflects only the mainstream newspapers' opinion. 
You may be cynical and say that Wikipedia editors just claim to be unbiased, but from my experience, the prolific ones really try hard to follow the rules and be neutral.

good question. please ignore bphase's and oleganza's answers, they did not pay attention when teachers tried to teach them math. 
the maximum difficulty is **2.6959947e+67** (in case you're not familiar with this formatting, this means 2.6959947 multiplied by a one with 67 zeroes behind it). 
how is this calculated? difficulty is defined as the *maximum target* divided by the *current target* ([source]( (the *target* is a number, and the smaller that number is, the harder it is to mine bitcoins). the maximum target is defined as **0x00000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF**, or in decimal formatting: **2.6959947e+67** (same number as in the previous paragraph) ([source]( so for the highest possible difficulty, we need to find the smallest possible *target*. a valid blockchain hash has to be smaller than the *target*. since the smallest hash is **0**, the smallest target has to be **1**. so the maximum difficulty is **2.6959947e+67 / 1 = 2.6959947e+67**. 
assuming that the current exponential growth in difficulty continues, this difficulty will be reached around the year **2050**. theoretically this means that we would have to change the bitcoin protocol then, but practically i would assume that until then an even more advanced currency solution will have emerged. 
i can also demonstrate how i calculated the date, if you like. i hope my answer helps.

It makes me wonder why the keys aren't longer in the first place, considering that Bitcoin is designed to last a few decades, and over such a long time it gets more and more likely that short EC keys can be cracked. 
The only thing protecting Bitcoin keys, is that the data signed with them is very short, and we can easily throw them away after each transaction. For example some clients make transactions in such a way, that when you send **0.1 BTC** from **address A** to **address B**, and you have **0.3 BTC** on **address A**, then the client will create an **address C** in your own wallet, and send **0.1 BTC** to **address B** and **0.2 BTC** to **address C**, leaving **address A** empty.

I believe that it would not make sense for Amazon, because they already have a near-perfect payment system that uses the fiat banking infrastructure. The only advantage of using Bitcoin might be a slight reduction in transaction costs, but at this time the disadvantages of a volatile currency would outweigh that advantage. 
For eBay that's a-whole-nother story, because eBay products only get shipped after the payment arrives, therefore the slow fiat transactions cause a delay in shipping. But Amazon sends immediately after the purchase.

to be fair, correlation does not prove correlation. the similarity does not mean that the price is caused by the attention. it could as well be the other way around. to find out, one would have to do a more exact comparison and see which graph goes up first. all things considered, it's probably a causation in both ways creating a positive feedback loop.

i can answer the second part: there are exactly 0.5 BTC mined in each block, and each block is created pretty much exactly 10 minutes after the last one. so the supply is completely under control. 
to explain a little about mining: many journalists write that you mine bitcoins by "finding" them. bullshit! 
here's what bitcoin mining actually is, and i want to make it as simple as possible. for bitcoin to exist, a block has to be created every 10 minutes, adding new transactions to the blockchain. creating the block means you collect all transactions, add them together in a long text, then hash it, and send the whole thing to everyone else. as an incentive for people to do this, anyone who creates a block may add 0.5 BTC to an account of his choice. the other peers check his block of course, so that he doesn't add more BTC or put fake transactions in it. so the creator of the blockchain adds the 0.5 BTC to his own address of course, and that is called "mining". 
the whole difficulty thing is just so that not everyone can create any block. it's like a lottery and one guy who participates in it is allowed to create the block. that mechanism distributes the blockmaking among as many peers as possible, thus making the network secure and robust. 
i hope i helped you understand the principle.
