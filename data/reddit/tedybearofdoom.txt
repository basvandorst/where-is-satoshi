Me either but I accidentally clicked it and I'd rather do the scans just in case. I'm hoping it didn't load far enough or I had to actually click something on the site.

It doesn't matter, no country has used a gold standard or silver standard since the 30's and 40's.

It'll bounce back eventually, the question is how much did you invest into it. I only have 580 in it right now and if I lost it I wouldn't be too upset.

I don't know why you would because it is true. I was going to set up a Live USB key with Armory but I decided having a dedicated HDD in my desktop is a lot more secure. I should be fine setting up, I've set up Ubuntu and CentOS before but I'll def PM you if I need help.

WHY SO SERIOUS?

Yeah, I just ordered a new hard drive a couple days ago to stick into my desktop and load up linux on it. I've been super careful on my windows computer by even only typing my complicated password with the on screen keyboard. For now I just wont log into any bitcoin related until I can sort this out.

So they are backing their dollar based on other dollars that they get from other people?
I mean, you can easily Google my claim. This is information you should have learned in middle school.

Looks like it is going to go sub 400 soon.

US dollar is backed by nothing but FAITH since the 1930's or 1940's.
