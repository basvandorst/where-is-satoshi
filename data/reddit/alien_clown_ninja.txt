Slide 2, where are they getting revenue from?  They don't have a product yet.
Slide 3, 21E6 wallet gets 75% of the mining rewards?  What?  Am I understanding this right, that only 25% goes to the person who owns the device?
Slide 4, "Even low power chips mine millions of satoshi annually".  1 million satoshi = 0.01 BTC, or about 5 transactions worth of $0.20 each, or 50 transaction of $0.02 each, or 1000 transactions of 1 satoshi.  Transaction fees will eat up everything.  *not even taking into account pool transaction fees to get the btc to the device, just to get it off*
What's going on here?

Gold has ~~inherent~~ value, in that it's used for things like shiny jewelry, and coating wires for better conductivity.  You can't do anything with bitcoin, other than transact with it.  So, transactions are its ~~inherent~~ value.

Yeah, obviously things only have the value that we give to them.  We give gold value because we can make shit with it.  We give spoons value cause we can eat with them.  We don't give a lump of dirt value, because, well, we can do some things with it, but we don't give it value because it's literally everywhere.  We give bitcoin value because we can transact with it.  The same thing that gives paper money value.  If bitcoin isn't used for transactions, then it has no value.  Similar to how a square of printer paper has no value, while that same square, if minted by the government with fancy pics on it, does have value.  People don't use the piece of printer paper for transactions.  They do use cash, hence the difference in value.

@_date: 2016-06-01 23:36:30
They can do that with or without a block size limit.  In fact, with a block size limit it costs them even less, because many of the transactions will get dropped and you can create load without paying for them.
@_date: 2016-06-02 00:37:35
It's not that simple.  Mempools aren't synced across the network, mempool management is user configurable.  Some nodes keep and relay transactions and some don't, and the ones that do will try to relay it to ones that don't.  If you set the right parameters, you can get transactions left over from the October spam attacks, remember the ones that paid 1001 satoshi fee and were like 15kB big?  Those still exist on the network and some nodes still broadcast them, even though they'll never be mined.  The network literally DoSes itself at no expense to the original spammer.
I'm not sure what you mean by a transaction relay is many hundreds of times lower than a block.  Do you mean a single transaction is less costly than a block full of 2500 transactions?  Of course that's true.  But relaying 2500 individual transactions is more costly than relaying a single block with them in it, transactions take up the majority of the bandwidth - in fact I think it was you who determined block relay is only 12% of node bandwidth usage wasn't it?
@_date: 2016-06-02 01:52:54
Why would lite wallets need to scan all transactions, I thought they just look at the merkle roots in the headers, which wouldn't get bigger no matter how many transactions are in the block.  The bandwidth cost to the network (which is the limiting resource, CPU cycles and hard disk space are not limiting) is about the same for a transaction that makes it into a block as one that doesn't, well, technically it's double but not many hundreds of times greater.  If you count all future nodes forever, then the resource cost of a single transaction is infinite, so that's not really a useful way to look at it.


Unless they drop it from their mempool and it is rebroadcasted to them and reaccepted again, then they relay it again, right?
@_date: 2017-01-21 20:04:40
That would change the block hash and make it invalid wouldn't it?
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:49:55

And this is where it becomes clear that the lightning network is a centralized solution.  Thousands of people transacting all over the world, yet only 2 entities receive money.
@_date: 2015-09-05 08:01:28
No, I referenced real world evidence that miners wouldn't opt in with namecoin - and with even fewer rewards we can reasonably expect even fewer miners to opt in to the sidechain.  And I also referenced real world evidence that the merge mined chain would get attacked as we saw do with coiledcoin, given that this chain will have a MUCH higher value being tied to bitcoin's value it is almost certain to be attacked, probably pretty much immediately after launch, before any miners even have a chance to opt in.
I barely talked about lightning because it is vaporware, so there's no point in talking about it pragmatically.
@_date: 2015-09-04 00:09:49
What makes you think blocks will immediately become 8MB as soon as the limit is increased?  Also, I live in North America and I don't have a bandwidth cap, and my upload (6Mbps - during peak usage times but let's go with that anyway - , $50 per month) could handle about 1944GB in a month by my calculation.  That's just upload, my download is much higher.

Bitcoin transaction fees are currently about 0.8% of miner's profit (at best during a spam attack where blocks are filled, normally lower than that).  Namecoin's blocks have about a 1.14% reward increase for miners to merge mine them.  Only 1/4 of bitcoin miners have bothered to merge mine namecoin, the reward would be much lower if 100% chose to merge mine.  How much are you expecting sidechain transaction fees to cost (presumably not more than bitcoin's), and how many of them do you expect to occur?

@_date: 2015-09-05 17:10:03
And therefore I posted my parent comment arguing that sidechains will not be adopted by miners due to no incentive and have a huge incentive to be attacked by miners by tying bitcoin's value to an altcoin.  I haven't heard an argument against that yet.
Edit:  and yes, he was talking about scalability, unless you are trying to argue that the lightning network and sidechains are not transaction scalability solutions.
@_date: 2015-09-05 06:45:12
Typing in all caps doesn't make you right you know.  Namecoin has been around merge mining since 2011.  Do you know what their hashrate is?  It's 1/4 of bitcoin's.  Meaning, a large bitcoin mining pool or two could attack it with absolutely no consequences, no loss in profit to the miners because they will still be mining bitcoin as usual.  Just like Luke-jr's Elgius pool did to coiledcoin when they went with merge mining.  And tell me, what incentives do miners have to opt in to merge mining a sidechain?  Unless that sidechain is giving them revenue (presumably it won't be, since there would be an outcry if bitcoin were to add more coins beyond the 21 million scheduled), miners will have no incentive.  Unlike with namecoin where there is an incentive and still after 5 years only 1/4 have implemented it.
And lightning network doesn't exist yet.
@_date: 2015-09-05 12:47:34
Sidechains are doomed to fail unless there is an incentive to mine them beyond transaction fees.  They will give another chain's coins the value of bitcoin without the inherent disincentive for a 51% attack.  With the proposed AuxPoW merge mining of sidechains, they will be actually inviting an attack from existing miners/pools by allowing it to occur without any financial disincentive to miners.  Under AuxPoW, bitcoin miners could attack the sidechain while still mining bitcoin and not losing any profit.  showed us this was possible by attacking coiledcoin with his Elgius pool years ago.  We've also seen that miners are unlikely to opt in to merge mining another coin with little reward by looking at namecoin, which still only has 1/4 of bitcoin's hashpower even after almost 5 years.  And to be clear, a sidechain is another separate blockchain just like namecoin is, the only difference is a sidechain's coins will have their value tied to bitcoin's value through a 2-way peg.
@_date: 2015-09-05 16:42:10

The real joke is the idea of sidechains
Let's tie an altcoin's value directly to the value of bitcoin via a 2-way peg.  But let's not call it an altcoin, let's call it a sidechain.  
Great idea Earl. 
 But here's the kicker, miners have NO INCENTIVE to mine it.

@_date: 2015-03-28 20:48:35
People keep saying this as if it's a fact.  The fact is, the bitcoin trading volume dwarfs the amount mined.  At $250/btc, we'd mine $450,000 per day at 12.5btc/block.  Trading volume is about 35 times that.  Even if 100% of mined bitcoins were dumped on the market, the halving will barely make a dent in price, simply due to trading volume.  We saw these dynamics play out in dogecoin already.

I don't really understand your Bob/Alice thought experiment, if they are buying from each other at $240 why would they not instead buy at $239.99 if someone else offers, why would they ignore?
Liquidity and volume are not the same thing.  Liquidity is how much in buy/sell orders are placed on the markets.  Volume is how much is actually traded.  You are right that liquidity has little to do with price.  It's volume that matters in terms of price, people actually completing trades.  And of people actually completing trades, miners make up a tiny portion.
But yes, it is more complicated than I laid out of course.  But when someone says "supply will go down with the halving, so if demand stays the same price will go up!" is even more simplistic.  I'm just trying to put into perspective how much the price would go up if that logic is true.  And it is not very much.
