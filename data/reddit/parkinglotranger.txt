Only a few people I've talked to have even heard of bitcoin. When I tell them what it is, it's more of a curiosity to them and not a potential investment.
Even if they do express interest in buying, I keep it vague, "You can buy them from exchanges online." and let them do their own research. I also mention that the price is volatile, so if they do buy them and it goes down they can't blame me for giving them faulty investment advice. 
If the person can barely operate a fucking computer, they probably shouldn't be buying bitcoin anyway. For those people, there is a steep learning curve they have to overcome first.

My problem with fiat, is the unintended consequences to our society. Jorg Guido Hulsmann wrote a fantastic essay about it on mises.org called The cultural and spiritual legacy of fiat inflation if you're interested in that sort of thing.

And now you've become them. Congratulations.

You need to work on your attention span.

No, you are the one supporting the nazi's. Stop being obtuse. 
Look, this is what YOU are supporting:

Hey, you started the whine buddy. Then you made vague accusations against someone calling them a nazi, with no backup or proof. Point your assault at your own damned self.

In 1989 my wife and I ate rather well on just $40 a week in groceries. Now we spend more like $150 a week for the same quantity/quality of food.

I liked that it is not inflationary, nor is it centrally managed, and it doesn't have the storage problems that gold has. It seemed to me like a fantastic modern way to store value.

What kind of passive income does it generate? Are you making income from creating pepes, or trading them? It's definately interesting. I can see a lot of potential with something like this.

I already joined it. This looks intriguing. Thanks for the info.

The simplest way to make a paper wallet, is go to bitaddress.org
Save the page.
Disconnect your computer from the network.
Open the page you saved. It has javascript that runs only on your pc.
Click on Paper Wallet.
Generate and print as many paper wallets that you want.
You can now send btc to your new paper wallet from your online (example: blockchain.info) or client (example: bitcoin-qt, mycelium, electrum etc...) wallet, but can't spend it from your paper wallet without sweeping it into your online or client wallet.
If you want to use the btc rather than simply store it, you should use a client wallet as it will be simpler. If you just want to store the btc, you can use a paper wallet for that as it is very easy, but make sure you understand that if you lose the private key to it, then all those btc stored on it will be gone forever. So you want to treat the paper you printed out just like it is cash.
A good intro to paper wallets: 
Spending from your paper wallet:

Don't give anyone your private key. You can give someone the public key of the sending and receiving address so they can see the transactions, and perhaps trace where the btc went to, but never ever give out your private keys or passphrases, as that would give them complete control over it.
I believe, in your Blockchain.info wallet, you can see your private key by clicking on the following: 
Next to your address click 'Show xPub'
However, this really sounds like an issue that Blockchain.info should look into for you.

One money, please.
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:14:14
How many coins?
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:54:03
Menu, Cold Storage, Scan in the private key from the paper wallet, select the destination address (your mycelium address), sweep (the full amount) into your mycelium wallet. The old private key will now have 0. All the btc will now be in your mycelium wallet.
