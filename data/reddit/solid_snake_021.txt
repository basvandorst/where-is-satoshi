Oh no, stop saying that nonsense. It actually shows great confidence in something when you see someone get “passionate” not “emotional”. The guy on the left is a jerk and we’ve seen them before.

And that’s why you should stay away! You don’t want them threatening you with asset freeze whenever you don’t feel like doing what they are telling you to do with your own money.

I was gonna buy more earlier, gonna wait a few more hours then buy some more. The best is yet to come ��

I’ll hit you back when we hit 100k at the end of this year mate.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:12:20
I’m buying lol, I’m so happy it’s crashing even though I’m losing money.

They are bad but I don’t believe you, I always get a response within a few days. I even submitted a ticket during the crazy time back in the end of the November and they back to me after 5-6 days. 
The usual respond time for me has been between 2-3 days. Could it be that they award less priority to people with transfer issue and more priority to the ones dealing with account problem?

It started raining so it went down .... 
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:07:24
Just dropped to about £5K lol.

I just use Bread on iPhone and nothing else, it’s the most secure and reliable wallet. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 08:40:46
You sound my ex with the only difference being other way around ��
@_date: 2018-03-21 05:19:58
It just got back to $9060.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:42:56
It didn’t ��������

Whoever that is capable of controlling the price of bitcoin behind the scenes is doing their best to force everyone to abandon bitcoin. 
It’s tough, specially if you have put a lot of money into it. If you pay close attention, you can see that there is so much support coming our way from all these new business’ and shops supporting it to people trying to deal in bitcoin. 
It’s going to be a rough ride but it’s also going to be fun. Most of us here never intended to sell so it doesn’t make a difference if it’s £5K or £50K.

3% at least in the UK! And you force the poor customer to pay for it unless they agree to purchase a lot of shit. Also this is only applicable to big small shops, bigger ones don’t charge anything.

I’m personally in for the long haul, so yeah unless you are not ready to wait 2-3 years then do what he said!
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:50:59
Bitcoin for life, I just wish I had more money to invest man!
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:12:18
United Kingdom! You got £10M in a bank? Too bad, you are only secured anything between £43K to £85K! 
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:13:16
Did not notice? Please! I was waiting to purchase more and I did. It is more than doubled now :D.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:26:05
I’m glad it happened, gave me the chance to purchase more. We’ll see in 3 years time of it was worth the risk.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:19:19
And just like that it dropped below 9K.
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:16:33
All the hands that have been secretly trying to push down the price have played their cards. Now price is slowly started to rise as it did before but it seems to be a lot more stable this time.
That’s the only explanation I could think of atm!
