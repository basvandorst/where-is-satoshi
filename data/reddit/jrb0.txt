Your price is locked in when you buy, so you’d benefit from the price increase. However, you’re unable to sell until it gets into your account.

Team long term hodl - why? I believe in the concept as well, but is it not clear that this bubble will burst eventually?

Can someone suggest some of the best Andreas Antonopoulos videos for someone who already has a base level understanding of bitcoin and wants to learn more?

The same way it’s worth anything now. Because people accept it as a thing of value, just like any other currency.

Best app for bitcoin price alerts? Coinbase is a little inconsistent and I’m worried about missing a crash

This is the best explanation I’ve gotten I think. Thank you!

But if that was the case then why the sudden surge up in the past few months? It seems like it’s just a giant hype train since nothing happened that would really increase the value of the currency itself that caused the surge right?

Beginner here - can someone explain how bitcoin isn’t a bubble right now? That would imply that $10k+/coin is the actual value of the currency which I don’t believe since it’s usage is still relatively limited.

But that’s where the bubble comes in. When the hype train inevitably exceeds any realistic sustainable value of the currency itself, one big sell could cause a panic and the value will drop sharply and suddenly. The vast majority buying right now (I can only assume) are people just trying to cash in on the artificial upward trend, and have no plans of ever using bitcoin, never mind switching their trust to it.
