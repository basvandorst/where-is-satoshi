You’re a fucking idiot if this is true. With that said I know a way to get your money back. You’ll have to PayPal me a small fee first. Pm me if you’re interested

What an idiotic response 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:49:01
It’s not hostility. It’s the truth. The panic seen in the last 2 or so days has been crazy. If you have weak hands then crypto isn’t for you.

I’m not going to give you conventional, or safe, advice. 
1. You need to understand that bitcoin can lose 50% of its value QUICKLY. So quick that you might miss it. Also, though, it TYPICALLY bounces back quickly. Do you have a plan on how you will get through those periods? How will you keep your emotions in check? What’s your “stop loss” period?
2. How much are you trying to make? You need to know this or the only time you will be able to withdraw your money is during moments of high emotional volatility. If that turns to be the case, you will panic sell and lose money.
3. Are you familiar with what’s going on in bitcoin? You recognize how much uncertainty there is past this 10k point (or the moon), correct? You need to be able to give yourself a confident reason as to why this will go up.
This move can put you back pretty far financially. Or, it can set you up pretty well. It is not rare for bitcoin to go up 10% in a week, which would be $3500 of UNREALIZED gain for you. I probably would do it but you need to be very careful bro/broette.
Good luck!

Where do you get this information from 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:16:02
It would take a significant crash to do so as that’s about a 30% dip. We will probably see a dip that size again but who knows when and at what price.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:36:09
I think you need another edit buddy
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:24:36
How do you avoid  in any financial system?
From my understanding there was a relatively equal opportunity to collect a large amount in the earlier stages (it still depends on how much currency one had to purchase the coin or mining equipment). In a system where those who have foresight are rewarded more, there will always be these situations.
Only way I can see a way to avoid this would be through some “share the wealth” system where there’s a monetary cap and forcefulness to ensure that there’s an equal distribution of wealth. Idk how much I’d like a system like that.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:23:03
This is a totally unoriginal post. You took minimal effort to explain yourself. As it stands, this thread is nearly pointless.

I appreciate you taking your time out to make your point. Anyone familiar with $DRYS know that it left a lot of people bag holding from the pump and dump. People who are not familiar with stocks may not be so aware though!

Maybe someone can give a more accurate response but my guess would be:
Lite coin is currently experiencing a lot of selling. When you sell, or buy, on a swing then you are subjected to a price that differs significantly from your expected price.
A limit order can help with that if you are buying from a platform that offers such.
