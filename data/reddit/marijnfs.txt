I wonder what they wasted 156 pages on then.

Thank god the government are going to save us from the wild Bitcoin, they definitely have our best interest in mind.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:16:30
It gets better if they accept a day transaction (about 8 dollar) and you pay for a year or so. Then they could make a discount because they save the CC fee. But yeah, it's not ideal atm, better accept any other coin.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:13:39
Are you perhaps planning to take litecoin or something similar? Did you have your own implementation to accept bitcoin or did you use a provider?
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:34:29
It does, the price of bitcoin dictates the value of the bitcoins being mined and if they electricity costs are higher than that for a miner they will stop mining (as they might as well buy more bitcoin for the same price) and then difficulty will adjust. Thus the cost of mining adjusts to the price and not the other way around as they report says.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:57:54
It's the solution though.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:15:07
Strange how the actual report is not to be found anywhere..
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:48:41
Very interesting to see how much effect on fees such a small increase in capacity has.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:57:28
Yes I agree it is scary, but the more the governments are coming down on financial freedoms, the more need there is for something like bitcoin. So a crackdown makes bitcoin harder to use, but also makes it more desireable which is an interesting interaction.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:51:59
There are real concerns indeed. However I think Lightning can also avoid having to keep bitcoin on an exchange at all. Now if I anticipate that I want to sell say 1 bitcoin when the price gets higher I need to send it to an exchange and keep it there (in there cold storage hopefully) so it's ready when the price increases to the point I want to sell. With lightning I can put the coin in a channel and it never needs to go in their hands until I decide to sell it, which I can do immediately if the price goes up since lightning is that fast. So it can also avoid exchanges having to keep control of bitcoins all together avoiding the hot wallet problem.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:24:59
Thanks, I especially wonder what they mean with 'cost of production valuation'. Doesn't make any sense to value bitcoin on the cost of mining, since mining adjusts itself to follow whatever the value of bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:05:04
There is, one can argue that such a move would make bitcoin legal currency which is not allowed under EU rules. A country could actually be charged for that.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:21:35
I don't think they literally use the bech32 in the tx itself, it's just for sending/scanning an address to a wallet, from there it uses whatever segwit uses.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:08:38
An exchange could accept lightning as well, so you could then send them bitcoin through lightning and the exchange only has to close channels when people actually request bitcoins from the exchange. With the volumes they operate with, they can probably keep channels open quite long until their reserves require this.
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:41:16
Yeah it's more entertaining for me, not really going very deep
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:23:32
He actually expresses he wanted to do it that way (and thought youtube live chat would be like that). I don't think he's very much cherry picking, it's just that a youtube chat is not going to contain the most thoughtout arguments.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:08:00
I mean he has to kind of give a starting argument, later on he starts responding (but yeah a youtube chat is not the best way to organize this)
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:31:25
It's probably correct, people will deny it being a bubble all the way until it pops. Just take a look at the price and zoom out to max:

Pretty good video, although I'm pretty sure only the coffeeshop can close the channel, not both! Otherwise it would mean Bob has access to a tx that's signed by both parties, can keep ordering more coffees, and then sneak in one of the old txs (where more money goes to him).

Probably to be used to insure transactions that take some time to process. So if I sell you something and fix the price in USD BTC while you think about it / do the transaction I'm not getting screwed when the BTC price changes

Yes that's the idea, an evil miner (say gov. Wants to break Bitcoin) can create maximum sized blocks. He doesn't even need 50%, the average will be able to grow exponentially and soon Bitcoin is unusable. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:28:07

Nice idea, also having anything close to a reasonable WiFi quickly makes a hotel stand out! 
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:38:06
I think they are not as short sighted as banks. Anyway bigger blocks is big gonna be a big limit on their hardware, and more transactions means generally more money even with lower fees. I'm not sure how big or a problem slower propagation is for bigger blocks though. Would be good if you could claim your hash ahead of your block.

There is still the use case for tourism, since Greece is largely a cash only economy and most pos systems are connected to their soon to be closed bank accounts. Also tourists can't get cash since machines are empty. 
If there are simple instructions on how to accept Bitcoin (just install wallet on your Android and have an open router in your shop) it might be an interesting alternative!

Since most bitcoins at the time on the fork were on exchange accounts, I guess the exchanges just sold a lot? Or maybe they didn't allow selling of bch therefore creating a large amount that is off exchanges but still in the hand of an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:36:15
Euhm that's a nice idea and all, but with the current fees lightning is not gonna work man. You need to be able to open and close channels with at least some degree of certainty.
@_date: 2018-08-05 13:56:15
Why would people spend more than they earn? If bitcoin was say the only currency available in that scenario, people still need to eat etc. So they would have to spend it, and make the same amount back. There is nothing stopping that from happening?
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:52:07
Well you would get the mining profits if the real transactions, so it's like running any mining operation. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:49:40
Well blocks are bigger than 1mb, but that doesn't help much. It's expected that by the time usage really picks up there will be a substantial block size increase. It's in the roadmaps

Yes but what we see from discussions is that such a jump might be hard to achieve. In previous forks the new version was clearly better and there was no controversy but now we get into territory where creating full consensus on a new idea is hard. This allows us to smoothly transition.

Its a natural way to grow the crypto space and helps with stability, like with any investing you need diversity for stability. Also the way Litecoin helped get segwit through is a great example how it can form a testbed for social consensus forming.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:26:07
Well the gist of it is that there was an hour long problem with the servers, and their mobile app kept reporting 'transaction failed, please try again' (maybe they are using transaction ids;) ), while the money was actually sent. ING (the bank) supposes it is still the responsibility of its customers and refuses to repay them, saying they have to try to get the money back themselves.

Wouldn't miners want to keep the transactions that don't fit ready for the next block? It's more potential fees in the pocket. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 10:45:43
Well we would need at least one or a few transaxtion per user to start a channel. This assumes the channels and corresponding amounts are exactly right for the time the channel lives. This would only have to be done once say per month so would scale quite well. Problem is in reality new channels need to be made all the time, and especially closed when a bad actor doesn't cooperate. This could create huge backlogs so we still need bigger blocks, but they wouldn't be insanely big.

What would be much better is a utxo hash tree in every block. You can download all headers till the beginning and trust the most proof of work quite reliably. Then you just get the utxo N blocks back and verify only the last N blocks. I guess this has already been proposed

On the other hand, thats only a factor of 800 from the world population. Say we do a simple scaling after that to 8mb, maybe later we only need 1 channel per two months, suddenly its a factor of 50. Maybe we just need to make some parallel sidechains to distribute the networks and we're there. Suddenly it's actually quite imaginable.

That's weird. To be fair I can imagine people spamming the site with small amounts to lower the average price / get loads of keys / shits and giggles. With a Paypall account they probably block your payment after the 10th time you buy it. But no idea if this actually happened.

There is a good chance there are going to be nodes that are involved in many channels. Especially since the more connected a node is, the more it is used in a path. Such nodes failing or just acting  adversely can kill many channels at once, so there is some worry there

Interesting. Still I'm not sure why the limits are so low; on my simple pc it seems to verify the latest blocks at a rate of 1 per 2-3 sec, and my download and upload rates are minimal as well. In principle you would expect to download at a rate of 1mb per 10 min ideally; let's say its 4 times that for inefficiency, we get around 2kb/sec. So I wonder how 4mb blocks would touch any limits (assuming an ok computer in a place with ok internet).

BCH new their kind of unannounced fork really needed to be a different chain, so they implemented replay protection. But I think the 2x group has a stronger intention to call themselves the real bitcoin chain, and won't implement replay protection in that case. If that is the case, the fork will get very messy. And a good buying opportunity;)

They can't take your deposit, that is what I'm saying. The only time they can take it is when you make more money than you deposited, in that case they can choose not to give you your profits. But it's possible that they start a channel with you directly, in this space there will be enough competition that some site is gonna do that.

No, it won't, it is a common misconception due to Keynesians. Your optimal allocation according to portfolio theory indeed puts all money in an asset that would have a guaranteed higher return (0% volatility) and that would prevent spending. However such asset doesn't exist. If this would be the case for Bitcoin and everyone agrees, it would be priced in. 
Actually, in general, if you know for sure your assets appreciate 5% (as used to be the case with dollars on a bank) vs 0%, are you actually feel more safe and think you can afford to spend some. If you can depreciating asset you actually have to safe harder because you need savings for when your old/kids go to college etc. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 11:55:41
1: In principle there is no limit, other than the money available in channels. In practice there seem to currently be some limits for safety reasons.
2. The fees are chosen by the nodes. The route searching system will of course favour the path with least fees so there should be a competition.
3. The mass adoption scenario is that new participants only have to make one or a few on-chain transactions to open channels. The can then transact through them for a long time doing hundreds of transactions with immediate confirmations without having to use on-chain transactions. In this mass-adoption scenario we assume the world is well connected with channels so you can transact with anyone. Very large transactions should probably still go on chain (although for big businesses who do large transactions like its buying a coffee could make huge channels if needed). A bigger block size is surely needed, although it doesn't have to be nearly as big as the no-lightning scenario.

Yes seems some see voting for segwit as a vote for the current process, I.e. make a bip (e.g. bigger block), wait for core to approve it by discussion, and then vote on it with mining. 
I think this process of meritocracy is good since it still keeps a lot of power in the hands of users instead of giving it all to mining. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:52:37
Who thinks this was the cause if volatility is stupid. The only effect is that prices between the exchanges will start to differ more and people have higher changes paying the wrong price.
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:25:45

@_date: 2017-01-16 12:14:07
Segwit segregates the transaction that someone wants to make and the signature to allow that transaction (which is called a witness for some reason). This means 1: the signature doesn't count towards the blocksize anymore, thus  more transactions fit it in a block, and 2: advanced scripts can now refer to transactions that haven't been signed yet, which is essential for lightning network constructions.
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:21:21

@_date: 2017-01-09 12:35:13
Interesting points! I don't think the miners are very disincentivised, but naturally conservative. Most have their own adapted versions of bitcoin code running over many computers, and adjusting that takes an effort. 
However, I think the miners are also actually believers in bitcoin and want to be progressive, and we will see bigger pools some time soon starting to signal segwit, knowing it will increase interest in bitcoin.
Once they start signalling, the other nodes will follow to not lack behind.
Also I hear the argument of soft/vs hard fork. I think the process followed now is essentially a soft-fork into a hard-fork. It's just a smoother process into the hard-fork, so I don't see the need for introducing a direct hard-fork. The current process is easily understandable, as long as we all recognise it will have to lead into a hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:56:11
If we see that a few times, you could argue that, for now i dont see it. At any rate, this behaviour is rational for non cooperating miners as well, so doesnt necessarily show centralisation, just cooperation

Thanks, very interesting links. I thought people didn't like segwit because it's an inherent size increase, but seems they argue that it will prevent the increase, very weird reasoning. They seem to argue more in a 'you don't give me what i want, you don't get the other thing' kind of way (still rational though). 
If this continues, either the bitcoin age of the great forks is coming, or the age of migration to whatever coin actually implements these things. It seems unthinkable now but if bitcoin progress becomes deadlocked like this, we might actually see altcoins beating bitcoin. We might say, hey we will catch up as soon as we see a big demand in features in other coins but this is not how innovations between competing products have played out in the past.

One of the currency manipulator signs according to IMF are that you have a large amount of foreign reserves (i.e. you save money) and an export surplus with countries (i.e. you are productive and people want your stuff). So the US first coaxed China to buy treasuries such that they have many USD, and then they figured we are done buying treasuries, and now they are called a currency manipulator.

One way is general trust, just like a seller doesn't expect you to start running at the cash-register before paying. Also there are cameras and they will use it, just like paying with a CC and charging it back later (or using a stolen CC).

They would have to push through a transaction that replaces the one you just saw. 
That is not easy but can be done especially if they have be Replace By Fee on, in which case most nodes would take a new transaction if it has a higher fee. This exists so you could up the fee when a tx is stuck. However I believe most nodes don't allow the change of the destination address in the tx.

Well there is no way to not allow this, no matter the tagging. A cooperating miner can always take a new tx from you directly with a higher fee, and we really can't start blocking those blocks. So might as well not artificially block it and pretend that prevents it.

Yeah great that you are doing it! I think right now the high fees and lack of fee options in wallets is a big problem for your usecase. 
I think the best way right now is to check  and select 144 blocks (~1 day) confirmation and look at the recommended fee. Right now it's 16 sat/byte or about 0.40 usd. If you use segwit addresses (if your wallet supports it) this can be even lower. You have to trust your customer to not double spend it until you get the confirmation after a day, but I think this is fine since most bitcoin payers are enthusiast and not scammers. The 40 cents if probably lower than your CC fee so for your side it's worth it.
Sad thing is that most wallets can't set a sat/byte and refuse to implement it, but be sure to recommend your users to set low priority, or they will pay several usd in fees and will be annoyed.

True, I think it's an assumption that works quite well for coffee level purchases. I would also like to see some basic payment channel functionality in a wallet, just put 30bucks in a channel to your regular coffee place once and keep using it for instant payments.

Seems like an improvement. Instead of having to add an extra delay for every hop in a route, there is only one delay basically. This massively decreases inconvenience when a channel is  closed and allows for longer routes.

If you would use a watchdog, you wouldn't have to give your private key, just a signed breach remedy transaction. Also, you can have quite long delays, such that you could check periodically, but you probably should indeed have some form or always on connection ideally.
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:32:13
Still I guess the idea is to make the blocks so full that CPFP would be more expensive than the amount gained? The attacker initiates sending the previous commitment transaction when fees are low so that's cheap. Then the victims all need to send their breach remedy transactions before the timelock and thus have to pay high fees to get in front of each other. It would definitely be painful even if they manage to send the remedy, so the attacker might not make money but would be a pain for sure.
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:59:57
Only to see it ride back to 100. Which fees were you thinking about btw? Exchanges normally have say 0.5% fees, and then a network fee that is hopefully adaptive when transferring BTC.

I don't find that very convincing. In case of the Euro, yes the decreased friction is a great helper, but in the cryptoworld, assuming lightning, the friction between two cryptocurrencies will be practically 0. And the Euro is actually giving massive real problems to many countries, which now would rather have the choice of another currency.
Also, yes cryptos are correlated but not completely. Any amount of decorrelation is significant and useful (speaking from experience). 
I understand that Bitcoin will probably (slowly) adopt other technologies and will be able to do whatever ethereum or Monero can do. But even if we assume all cryptos have the same features, their actual distribution is very different and that is the real crux. That is why they will have decorrelation, and different cost of entry. 
If the rest of the world has to join Bitcoin, that would imply a massive transfer of wealth to the current owners of Bitcoin. To a degree that might be worth it, but they can also choose to start their own coin or join a relatively new one which will have a lower barrier of entry. Therefore it will be rational for them to put at least part of their value in other coins. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 09:13:08
He's talking about making two transactions to the same (paper) bitcoin address. So to spent them later, he has to refer to both outputs that spent to then since they exist in different txs with different hashes. So if he makes many small contribution to his wallet, he will have many inputs to spent it later, even though it's the same address.
@_date: 2019-01-30 10:13:48
Maybe open a channel towards a popular output? Like bitrefill or something
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:58:26
I think that's flawed thinking. There is no reason to think having multiple currencies means you can just inflate with new ones, each of the currencies have to earn their value. For the same reason we have many currencies in our world already, not just one. 
Having multiple currencies has one main advantage; it diversifies your assets and reduces your volatility, due to each currency having a very different distribution of ownership.

@_date: 2019-01-26 20:48:10
But to make a transaction you have to refer to the outputs, and their output number, which can have different hashes due to the different amounts for example. So how can a verifier know which outputs to join?

That is indeed the order, some of your customers open channels with you, then some node sees that you are popular and makes a bigger channel with you (to get some sweet fees) which makes you more connected. 
I can also imagine that certain big nodes might provide a feature where you pay them something upfront and they open a channel with you, which might be great to enter the network initially.

Dunno I can see a point. We want open decentralised information that no-one can censor. Also there needs to be an agreement what is posted, i.e. to prevent censoring it's good to have a hash of your post in the blockchain where you can always refer to it can't suddenly disappear.

If you do solo mining you can put any transactions in a block you want, as long as they are valid. But since that is not feasible you will join a pool in which case they decide what gets added.

They should somehow take turns mining. If two miners run their miner all day for one bitcoin they would eventually both end up with half a bitcoin. If they take turns and run the first and second half of the day respectively they still end up with half a bitcoin (coins get distributed over the amount of processing power) but only use half the energy. This however requires a central organisation.
@_date: 2018-04-01 09:09:54
As does AzireVPN
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:39:58
No what might have happened is that the price went up quite a bit. All the people who short borrowed bitcoins and sold them, to buy them back later (ideally at a lower price, so they make money). However when the price goes up enough, the money they have on the exchange might not be enough anymore to buy back the owed bitcoin. In that case the exchange forced them automatically to use all their funds to buy the bitcoin (margin called) which creates a huge buy volume pushing the price up even more. Thus more people get margin called and suddenly you have this huge spike due to all the money of these people being used to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-09-19 10:09:11

The fact that there are moments where the mempool gets emptied is not proof that there is almost no demand at that point, there is just n consistent supply so people don't expect those moments. If that supply would be constant, like with a larger block size, then it would be filled constantly.

@_date: 2017-05-24 07:55:58
It's because the transaction part is what really needs the commitment through POW, and the signatures are for checking. A new node could say, I trust this much POW and can accept all transaction to that point and can verify the hash, without having to download and check the signatures. So their 'role' is different.
Also it helps with the blocksize increase, since you can put fancier transactions (payment channels) in the witness, and just put the hash of the script in the transaction.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:32:01
I see everyone has to pay different amounts? They could be checking for that, but yeah def verify at least some people that got decrypted. Most ransomware stories I heard actually did decrypt after payment but his coordinated attack might be different. Point is it would make sense for them to actually decrypt so everyone actually pays.
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:32:12
Yeah so this we discussed, normally ransomware creates an address per payment so it might be that they don't intend to decrypt. Only possibility is that they specifically create a unique amount to be paid per user (from the payments it seems everyone pays different amounts), but this is a bit 'hopeful' I guess.

What is bad about miner activation for HF?
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:58:10
Well it is set to have a bit higher acceptance of increasing its capacity (already has 4 times the capacity without segwit). So for the force able future it will stay an easy option to trade some safety (less mining power)  for capacity / lower fees. If LN is anything like it is envisioned, it will need a whole lot more capacity and LTC will be an easy provider for that.

Well, say the US says tomorrow, every citizen has to pay us 5000 USD per month or we will shoot you. That would indeed create a demand for USD that might be able to keep it being used as a currency.
But that is why the constitution says taxes should be proportional, so they are proportional to transactions you do and you can always keep that on the side and pay taxes no matter the valuation. Under these constraints, a devaluating dollar isn't at all helped or supported by a obligation to pay taxes, the dollar just became cheaper so it's easier to pay your taxes!
The same goes for debts, if your debt is denominated is some other currency/commodity you either pay in that currency/commodity, and if the USD lowers in value you can use those because they are cheaper to buy. It doesn't add value to the dollar itself.

It is because of his strong believe in metallism, which is hard to argue against once someone believes it and is widespread through all economists. Like how people think USD has value because you can pay your taxes with them (a belief that still baffles me).

I  believe lock-in is basically segwit2x. They first vote to lock in bip91 (needs 80%), and when that happens they start doing bip91 and rejecting other blocks (just like uasf) which means they also signal segwit.

It has worked fast for me ( other than having to wait for a Bitcoin confirmation). But I only tried with litecoin.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:12:47
I would say they are bits of paper, whether you pay taxes or not. If somehow taxes were reduced to zero, do you think the dollar would lose all its value?
You can indeed argue that given two currencies, and all else being equal, debt in a currency that gets extra help from the government to get them back, has more value. But I don't see how this gives some base value to currencies. 
I really don't thing the argument that a currency needs some base value, be it gold or something else, to 'build up' a much higher is correct. Once a currency far exceeds it's intrinsic value, this relatively low intrinsic value doesn't give it any security. If you use something as a store of value, you don't say, well at least it can't go lower than 1% of it's current value and feel good about it. This is not the reason why something like a currency of gold has value.

"Bitcoin is a currency" - German Bundesbank. Maybe I read between the lines too much
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:09:55
Main arguments are that the balancing of payment channels doesn't scale well (lots of money stuck in channels). And that some nodes need to become major hubs that take fees for it to work, I.e. centralisation of sorts. 
Also, all nodes in a route need to be online during the payment, so no offline donations. Finally, the settling of transactions, especially in cases of adversaries, become very prudent and then you really don't want full blocks like we have now.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:44:23
I'm talking about the protection against the worst case, which is the timelocked part of the tx. To make the trustless routing possible you need a cascade of timelocks which need to allow enough time to detect a tx and submit a new one to the baselayer. So I'm saying the way Bitcoin works now is not reliable enough unless you use very high fees which creates attack vectors. E.g. it might be more expensive to claim your money back than to let another person steal it.
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:10:57
There is all kinds of speculation including that. The other one is that a raid in Montreal might be connected and they got one of the servers, forcing AB to quickly take everything offline.

"Among them is that fact that on most weekens the effective feerate drops to 1/2 satoshi/byte" I don't know how you get to such statements. There are 300000 transactions per day that pay $.50 and you think the demand for the next 300000 drops to 0? There is no support for that idea.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:25:51
Why are they paying different amounts
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:53:06
You know that for every hop in segwit there is a delay within which a transaction needs to be settled? We can't have uncertain txs confirmation times so this is coin to be very expensive or we need huge delay times limiting the number of hops; this is not a network that can function like the settlement layer that it is supposed to be.
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:33:47
Just for my personal interest, what OS were you using? 
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:49:56
Point 1 will not be the case, assuming 'legacy chain' will become the BU chain. As soon as it become BU it will also activate segwit and will have more capacity on top of that.
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:11:41

@_date: 2017-07-03 09:36:32

@_date: 2017-07-20 13:25:54
Well it takes time to develop code, and if they want to take their time until the 21st that's not a crazy idea.
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:40:32
Good thing is core is compatible with the initial segwit2x activation, so we'll probably get segwit soon!
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:50:26
He probably means witnesses are (unfairly) discounted, thus old style transactions are made more expensive because they have to push out a new style transaction. Or something like that.
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:38:35
It is up too, although I think 1 block will be made bigger than 1 to properly fork away.
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:15:20
I see, so they say other upgrades/bips will take care of overt since it is more trivial to block.
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:52:52
That depends on quality of lightning code, LND was still in alpha last time I checked, hope they get things ready soon!
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:29:52
But it explicitly adds the rule that only blocks that sign a certain flag are valid, that is a hard fork

@_date: 2017-07-18 23:55:08
It's not clearly desirable, especially because it greatly increases chances for activation with mining power below threshold!
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:08:08
When is 2x actually planning to signal bit1? A week before?
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:48:03
They will have 2mb + segwit very soon after that, but for a month: weee
@_date: 2017-07-08 00:02:30
Yeah but I was describing the case where someone claims and old state of the channel. The claim that is left for the other party could be less than the fee, so you can steal that money, the other party would lose less money that way.
@_date: 2015-02-08 12:06:04
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:40:58
Yeah i guess they take the current rate somewhere and tell them to send that, still could be some extra logic to keep the prices unique. Still it's weird if they really dont decrypt and pool all money in one address, they would make more when they play honest. 
Maybe they are not do sofisticated, or they fucked up the code that creates the address.
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:51:03
bitcoin.com mentioned they just didn't update all their systems yet, which is quite possible for systems at that scale. Other pools allow their users choose themselves what they mine.

Yeah better look at  they separate bip91 lockin from bip91.
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:36:56
I think by now we know how to do a size increase hard fork, we wouldn't have to do testing on the level of segwit, this is a much simpler upgrade
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:50:09
Well being open source either side can incorporate each others changes. I think the support for 2x may depend a lot on how full the blocks are by then, say lightning is actually working by then this might be quite full.
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:48:50
Thanks good summary. Seems 2x first signals bit4 and when 80% is achieved it only accepts bit1 signalling blocks (so original segwit activation). Question is when do they start signalling, im guessing a week before.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:16:38

Yeah I think a few per month is more realistic. But by that time we can maybe deal with gigabyte blocks. Also we can already scale more by having more chains (either alts or something new) and probably go for more distributed and bloomfilter style checking of txs. I think by the time we get that far it will be possible.

Still that is a lot, enough to make the 20% left be so unusable it might just automatically die. Imagine 1 hour average block times, with a retarget several months away, a chain doesn't survive that I think.
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:20:38

Running up until august i think we will see significant mining power behind bit4, I'm not so sure how most participants will react, they will probably start listing both coins on exchanges, wallets can choose either because they are not invested, the real question is wat accepters of Bitcoin will do.
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:21:13
Of course the pretty strong assumption is that these nodes wont upgrade to a slightly more expensive server? I mean, obviously they are now running on the cheapest option because they don't need more and thus would be excluded, but it is easy to upgrade from a 5 dollar/m server to 10-15 dollar/m. Of course it is more expensive but not the end of the world.

Yeah I guess that's true, not sure what the different measures do. Only thing I can think of is that lock-in measures bit4, while bip91 measures the number of consecutive bit1 votes, since one not-bit1 block would reset the counter of time bip91 is active.

Funny I would do this is I was in America and had dollars. I would rather have a load of RMB right now than USD.

I think also full nodes might want to use this, mostly to reduce the traffic load on the network, one of the main reasons why 1mb+ blocks are supposed to be centralising. If people could start a full validating node by just verifying one month of transactions, the load on the network would be much lower while still having full validations.

At 2 dollar tx cost it still is. The competitor takes 10% at least, so we have some leeway. (though obviously the costs are horrendous).

We are gonna get segwit by august 1st, aren't we *breathing intensifies*

Ok nice to hear your view of bitcoin, I think it should be an everyday currency and either bitcoin becomes that or another coin will be.
@_date: 2017-06-24 07:16:47
I'm also wondering what they are trying to achieve. Could very well be that they realise this kind of sensitivity in a market is illegal and the losers have a good case on court. Definitely cheaper then to just pay them a few millions.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:54:47
It's gonna be a chain split isn't it..
@_date: 2017-06-02 07:12:23
I imagine going to receive, copy the address, then go to send and send maximum to it. Check the preview option to see if it indeed joins the outputs. Then realise that your coins will be 'stuck' for a long time until the tx gets accepted.

What do online retailers care if they wait a day for a payment? If bitpay takes the conversion risk and the retailer just doesn't do anything until it's confirmed there should be no problem? This is not a local coffee shop where you can walk away with the product.

Ah I see I meant year to date, not since one year ago. Anyway, link:

You don't even have to compare to BTC. Year to year USD index is down -6.5%! That is huge for the 'stable reserve currency' 
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:57:55
Yes seams that the payment processor space needs some more competition and time to develop but as you say, the incentives can be very clear (when we fix the fee problems)

The would have to open the channel to him, or someone else with which the exchange has an open channel. The receiver does not have to open anything

You scrolled far down

Any fork does that, also soft forks
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:26:55
Check this site:  It does a good job (better than 21) in estimating fees. 144 blocks (one day) results in 25 sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:15:29
Damn. Did you tell anyone in physical space about this?
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:40:47
Litecoin has the benefits of using the stable proven codebase of bitcoin securing billions of dollars, and it has a good hashrate (and soon will be on many exchanges).
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:37:40
Also fun: it has segwit in three days 
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:38:19
Btw if you check  for your case and take maximum conf time (1 week) the fee is approx 23$. Not ideal but maybe low enough in your case. Otherwise wait for the chaos that will be uasf and the other fork and hope segwit helps a bit. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:08:29
And a lot of GDP is consumption, mostly through increase in debt, it is definitely not money that can be diverted to pay of the debt if it's the debt that creates the GDP

He should probably get a pint, and wait for August / september to be over.
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:42:23
The rise is because of the segwit2x signalling, nothing changed for uasf

That's true, though get Germany is a much more conservative in these things than other countries in the EU. Their banks are heavily intertwined with government seeing how much influence Deutsche bank has on politicians

That is not a strawman, here is an example what a strawman looks like:

Is.. Is this real?

You can make this argument in any direction, this is just nonsense
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:19:43
I think he definitely has points. The bubble, especially in altcoins, can very much be a bubble that needs a serious correction. Not in the 'actual value is 0' sense, but in the sense that value might be mis-allocated. This is definitely something to be aware of and happens in any new market.
In general, the bitcoin-maximalist position seems very flawed to me. There is a lot of space for innovation, and bitcoin is set out to be the most anti-fragile and thus least innovating version of it (for good reasons). This leaves a lot of space for other crypto-currencies. Though I think this speaks more to the strength of crypto than a weakness. The argument that this leads to an unlimited inflation and thus worthlessness of all crypto seems silly, some will come out with value, others will just drop (as with any value determination in markets).
The third argument is interesting; not the criminals part, there are plenty of use cases for normal human being to use bitcoins; remittance alone is a multi-billion dollar market, besides that it can hedge against the inflation of fiat currencies of which Peter is very aware (and it can't be taken away the way gold can and has been). 
The merchant part is more relevant, but actually not a problem. If the user thinks bitcoin is more convenient for transactions (which I certainly do, way better than CC e.g.) and has a certain confidence in it, he/she can keep a certain balance of bitcoins for future use (say a conservative 1% of assets). The user can keep paying for stuff bit bitpay, merchant sells bitcoins for dollars, and because the users want to keep their 1% they will buy it back. You might wonder that buying bitcoin for every purchase is a problem and might as well pay directly in fiat, but of course the buying of bitcoin can happen on a large timescale, say you buy 200$ worth of bitcoin, use it to buy many smaller purchases (maybe videogames on Steam), and once in a while buy back. You still have the convenience of bitcoin, buying back is not such a hassle (no need for CC) and if on average users keep their % of assets in bitcoin the demand is steady (and merchant can keep cashing out in dollar as soon as they get BTC).
All this ignores the current problems with transaction fee and backlog making bitcoin shitty to use, but these issues are a political problem, not an inherent one to crypto.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:11:49
You would expect Peter to be aware of how bad of a measure market cap can be. I guess it is hard to understand for many investors how different a cryptocurrency is from a stock, you have much less rules about how the currency is released, whereas as stocks are often released at the same time and thus market cap makes more sense.
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:34:39
Do they have mBTC nowadays?
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:55:48
It can even have adverse effect; the more people 'agree' on one side, the more return the opposite side gets, making it lucrative for actors to actually make the opposite happen.

That is sexy

USA right? What other country puts their citizens in prison for so long for doing business?
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:51:20
Yes thats the way to do it. Of course when you are hacked, they can just change it already in the browser. Really we need signed transaction requests that are verified on the hardware.

Keep a photo of it, they will be as rare as the dodo soon

An over leveraged market should be countered like this. People making he market this unstable should be punished so next time they will actually check the current leverage before blindly trading on margins, this is the only way to make a stable market. The other way is to lock the market down so much that trading isn't possible, which would make it stable by being super slow.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:39:25
Sometimes the block times are shorter by chance. E.g. we had two consecutive hours of 8 blocks. 
 Only a 33% increase can help a lot;)

Looks awesome, kind of strange that the B is blocked though?
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:43:19
Yeah that's probably it

This is like mtgox all over again. Failure upon failure and people just kept using it.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:58:24
I guess they defer it till the time the hardfork will be activated (3 months after segwit i believe?). If e.g. the august softfork falls flat there is no need for complex replay protection immediately; although the replay proof new header types would be a pretty nice feature to have.
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:02:49
No problem occurred when pasting. So if you don't expect it, you wouldn't notice the change when pasting in your Trevor app and it will after that of course match with your screen.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:35:39
I think many exchanges would show both coins so it will get legitimacy
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:19:10
I believe bip91 will vote for segwit through bit1, so it will sort of activate through bip9
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:49:13
They were already forced to remove feature from the app
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:07:24
Maybe I'm mixing up with the Samurai wallet; they had some features they had to remove:  Although maybe Wasabi is safe for now, it definitely puts the question forward for how long they can do something like that.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:42:15
I think they will not add uasf because they understand segwit2x signalling will vote on bit1 anyway. So segwit will just activate and then they will after that simply avoid the HF later, i.e. pick their battles.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:58:04
Good question, worth a try. In electrum check the bip box
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:42:32
No they are not always bidirectional, the typical version is unidirectional (but can be reversed with tricks). The receives has to participate insofar that he/she has to provide you a public key, but that's it. However, when you want to send it, the receiver has to be online or somehow receive your message (since it is not stored in the blockchain at that time).
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:22:52
Is core on-board?

How do you know they were under market price? It is hard to see which orders are taken in such an event.

This is probably the best solution, though I don't like money hanging a round of steam. Ik only they would start taking litecoin!

Why? If segwit transactions cost half of a regular transaction, who is not gonna use it?
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:55:34
If they make it before the deadline.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:33:56
Yeah replay protection might actually be achievable within segwit2x, both sides kind of need it. Then we can really split bitcoin into what either side wants, it's probably the best solution.
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:53:27
But at 15% that's gonna be close to 100 days i guess? Also, is it smoothed or will jump directly?
