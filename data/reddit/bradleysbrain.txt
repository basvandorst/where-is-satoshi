And as long as bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is paired to fiat, and is acquired only by those with fiat or by those with the ability to purchase large amounts of mining equipment with fiat, it will continue to be manipulated and controlled by those with the most fiat. Nothing is changing in the balance of wealth. If anything, it is becoming more unbalanced because of this.

I actually suggested this in the cryptocurrency subreddit and the post got deleted 
Although my suggestion was to arrange to have every single human we could possibly coordinate with from every coins telegram, Twitter, subreddit, etc, all agree to do one huge market buy with $20 each to give the market a pump that would send shockwaves through all media outlets. 
Sure, some people would end up buying at much higher prices but the point wouldn’t be about buying at the best price. It would be about sending a message to the market manipulators and Banks.

The unfortunate part is that i think bitcoin has done more to transfer wealth away from the people who don’t have much money to those that do. At the most fundamental level, i don’t know how something that is traded for fiat is ever going to rebalance the wealth away from those who already have the most fiat. And the disparity is becoming exponentially worse. I read the other day that the richest 8 people in the world have more wealth than the poorest 4 billion. In the USA, the three wealthiest have more money than the bottom 50%. And ironically, the disparity really took off after the financial crisis. The banks did all of the damage, yet somehow got even greater  benefits.

I understand that. But ive watched market buys of less than 100 BTC be enough of a catalyst to start a reversal.  And no, it wouldn't be a pump and dump. Just a pump.

Please express how stupid it is. Because the biggest downside i see is paying the taker fee and spending $20 on bitcoin
And at the very least, even if it didn't succeed, it would potentially put some of the market manipulators on alert that the market isn't ENTIRELY theirs to have their way with

Yes. They do buy and sell to themselves. In order to cause other people to panic and sell into them as well. Ive observed a chat on IRC between individuals who run bots on bitmex discussing their strategies. It definitely happens.

And this is closer to what would be considered an investment club rather than market manipulation. Especially if it was out in the open.
