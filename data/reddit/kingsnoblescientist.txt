No one said a Lamborghini wouldn't been $1000 on that date either.

No, but mining was rewarded with Bitcoin. I suppose the couple of "halvenings" since I paid close attention have reduced that reward. Three-plus years ago I don't think anyone anticipated that transaction fees would become the bulk of a miner's payment until the reward itself was essentially zero. I don't think the idea that blocks could be filled ever came up.
Forgive my ignorance, I really haven't been paying that much attention since Mt Gox was still a thing.

I remember when near-zero fees were a selling point of Bitcoin. Honestly I've missed most of this debate already (I just hold for the most part - hodl? wtf), but has that been appropriately addressed?

So basically your study contradicts mine.  Cool.  Do you actually have more than one?  I do.




Never mind the number of citations of the authors of my sources, which is generally a [good measure of how widely accepted and reliable the research is]( is orders of magnitude higher.
The science on climate change is settled.  If you can't accept that, we have no more to discuss.

That is an absurdly and unnecessarily high burden of proof, and you know it. I'm sure such a list exists, and if it doesn't, it could be created. But I'm not wasting any more of my time trying to convince a science denying fuckwitted twatwad internet stranger of basic fucking facts.

Well, [since you insist]( I can give you one of the 3%, from the article you linked to: Sergey Kravtsov.
[Seriously though,]( here's your [3%](  In comparison to the ~75 on that list, here are [620 who contributed to a single 1000 page article in support of climate change](  Yes, I know the numbers from those two articles don't make 97% and 3%; [fuck off]( and make/find your own list.
The 97% figure [*is* comprised of a single data set]( as I have [already pointed out](
[If I'm angry and emotional]( it's because your opposition to basic fucking science has very real and negative consequences for the whole planet.  In my opinion, I have expended enough time and energy on your [ridiculous demands for *more* and *more specific* evidence.](  As if a list of scientists by name would [actually convince you]( when [the science itself does not](
Now, I have you RES tagged as ["science denying fuckwit"]( and will henceforth ignore any further misinformation-spreading comments from you.

Are you shitting me? Like this is some kind of conspiracy? The names are attached to the papers. If that's what you want, do it your fucking self.

How much would it cost to have a keg of Cantillon Fou' Foune delivered to my house in New Orleans?
I'm serious, because if you can deliver this, you can deliver anything. I mean Zwanze would just be unfair to test you guys with.

Sure why not? I've been wondering how this whole changetip thing works. Now I'll have an excuse to learn.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:41:09
Awesome.  Well I just loaded up my changetip account, so let's get tipping.  Thanks for the lessons.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:31:16
Thank you much good sir.  Looks pretty simple.
Lesson  sending 100 bits private
Question:  what exactly does "private" do?  It private messages you instead of replying to the post you tipped?

The world GDP is about $70 trillion.  Were Bitcoin to replace existing currencies, as it theoretically might, I don't see why Bitcoins couldn't be valued that high, especially if you start including the effects of fiat inflation

There's also still the limitations of banks' business hours.  Taking advantage of the dip requires more planning ahead than the casual trader is willing or able to do.

I'd be so happy to be proven wrong, no amount of edible crow would put me down.
