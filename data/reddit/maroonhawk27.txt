Yeah I was really asking because I was curious if they didn’t have the cash. Which would be a rookie move!!
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:21:41
Drinks on me tonight, boys!
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:04:08
Why are you buying bitcoin on a credit card?
@_date: 2018-09-14 14:17:59
It about time in the market, not timing the market ��

We’re still on track to reach $40k by the end of the year...
@_date: 2018-10-25 02:37:43
I stick with scratch off tickets. You only lose if you stop playing. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 02:39:18
Yeah, I don’t think so
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:57:47
“Now I’m only 300% down!”
@_date: 2018-10-05 05:17:32
Fact or speculation? O_o
@_date: 2018-10-12 04:53:44
We’re still on track to hit a million usd by the end of this year though, right?
@_date: 2018-10-03 02:12:33

@_date: 2018-10-25 02:38:21

@_date: 2018-06-24 01:13:10
I’m up 110%
@_date: 2019-10-06 14:40:26
Now is the time to sell al your belongings and take loans out to buy more bitcoin! It literally can’t go tits up
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:11:12
If you lose it all you can just take other peoples  money and pay the first group back a premium. 
Rinse. Wash. Repeat!
@_date: 2019-06-16 03:11:45
@_date: 2019-06-16 03:01:25
It would be irresponsible to not take loans out now and buy more!
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:20:20
Seriously though. Is my booty not safe in Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:03:41
My bad guys 
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:16:10
Op bought in  and is now forced to drive Ford Taurus. For those of you who don’t remember the for Taurus, it was not cool in the 90s either!
@_date: 2018-11-04 20:14:16

@_date: 2018-11-01 03:51:30
You buy bitcoin at ten years old?
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:58:32

@_date: 2018-11-02 23:30:51
How’s my times are going to post this meme on this sub?
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:19:21
Yeah put all of you money into bitcoin. What’s the worst that could happen?
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:06:51
Only the true fortunate get to buy at the top and bottom 
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:26:16
That was a joke, dawg
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:19:48
That’s why I stick with bitcoin cash 
@_date: 2019-05-23 04:00:05
How do I buy bananas with bitcoin?!
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:21:20
“Fact is...” ��
