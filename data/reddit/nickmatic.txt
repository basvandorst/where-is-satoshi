And if this were done with cash, how would the transaction be embargoed and the thief brought to account? It wouldn't, as we can see that fraud and money laundering occur with regular old cash at a far greater rate than anything else. I don't think a currency itself needs to be socially secure. That can be built on top of the currency.

Indeed, you are correct that the second transaction can be the one accepted. I was in error. But it will always necessarily be identical to the first transaction, otherwise it would not be accepted.
When you say a 3rd party hacker can modify my transaction, this isn't accurate. Nothing about the transaction itself (not the amount, nor the recipient) can be modified, only the "wrapper", in a sense. It's the same candy bar inside.
It's like sending the same letter in a different envelope, verifiably signed by the same person and with the same letterhead, date, and fancy paper as the original. Who cares what envelope it came in? It matters not at all to the recipient. When they see the first one delivered in the next mail they realize that it's a duplicate, scratch their head, and move on with life.

Coinpayments sends the bitcoin directly to my own wallet. The coins are in my control as soon as they’re sent and hence it’s 100% adoption from my perspective. I don’t mind paying the 0.5% for them to handle processing and provide the hooks for the UI.

This is a good point, but I'll add that paper wallets (in theory) are the most secure method of storage as long as they're generated offline by a computer that has trusted software on it.
e.g. take an old laptop, wipe it and install linux (after verifying the download), then install bitaddress.org on it locally (and verifying the download).
Should be safe (though not necessarily user friendly!)
PS Don't lose the private keys or you've lost your $!!

I'm a merchant as well. Believe me, credit card companies have no interest in deciding these things fairly. I've been through many chargebacks and their chief interest is in resolving issues at the lowest cost to themselves. Neither the consumer nor the merchant are the priority.

FWIW, there are strong signs that China has been actively positioning itself for at least economic independence, if not dominance, for a long time. E.g. amassing gold stockpiles (and encouraging Chinese citizens to do the same), amassing control of natural resources, investing in alternative energies, and ceasing to buy US debt. It appears that the US may be at a severe disadvantage in these areas. I'm no expert, but I find these things striking.
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:11:04
This is right. Compromise of an online service is pretty likely if it's a high value target. For storage of any significant amount, use an offline wallet created by an offline (and never online) install of linux or a live CD. Use BIP38 encryption and then you can safely store the private key pretty much anywhere (even online) without too much worry that it will be found. Just use a long and complex password.

Can you elaborate? I get that dropbox, etc, can't be trusted, but then the weakness is in the BIP38 password, no? Will look more closely at Electrum...
@_date: 2014-01-19 16:23:18
I totally agree, though my point is that it doesn't seem like that much effort at all for a bad guy to compromise large numbers of hardware wallets once they're mainstream. Maybe this just won't be a widespread issue, but I can envision the negative PR claiming Bitcoin itself is insecure after a few people got screwed by compromised hardware. Not good for Bitcoin.
On the point about the credit card fraud, I wonder about this. I have a small business that accepts credit cards and let me tell you, they pass every single fraud cost on to me, and charge me a processing fee on top of it each time as well. From my perspective, it doesn't look like fraud costs the card provider anything. But I don't have a complete understanding of this for sure.

The devs can't just make any changes they want. All miners have to agree to use any new code changes. It's not just pushed out to everyone automatically. And there's no incentive for miners to accept any code changes that don't have a positive benefit for them. They each decide for themselves what version of the software to use and change version if they see it as an improvement.

Put in a friendlier way, basic computer security practices (even just checking the URL before logging into a site) elude most people, and they confuse the idea of being hacked with simply having willfully given their login information away to an untrusted 3rd party.
With those basic practices in place, bitcoin gets a lot more safe.
Happy to elaborate if needed.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:28:33
Beyond paper wallets I suggest the following: Create a BIP38 encrypted wallet with a long and complex password.
You can put that wallet in your dropbox account and some other cloud storage, and also print it out and put a copy in your wallet and on your fridge. Diversity is key in this regard so you have multiple backups, and only minimal security is necessary.
Write your password down (preferably encoded somehow in a way that only you and family would understand) and store it in several separate places, with family members, etc. You can get creative here, but again diversity is key as is security in this case.
Do not associate the password with the encrypted wallet in any way. You don't want someone who finds the password to be able to locate the wallet and vice versa.
If you take care in doing this, it's hard to imagine a way this could be compromised. Open to suggestions, though.
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:22:45
Yeah, I want to love Trezor. And I think it will be a good solution for security-minded people like you and I. But how can it become ubiquitous for the average Joe? If I buy one at a convenience store, I can't know that some component in it is a sneaky ASIC that generates easy to crack keys or something, while still presenting a valid serial number and working with their 2FA and all. Not that hard to swap them out at some point in the supply chain. Again, for Joe User, not you and I.

I don't think mainstream consumers adopting linux matters one bit. Linux holds a place as one of the most used and trusted OSes powering web and database servers, supercomputers, and computing clusters. Most web sites use linux and any organization who does computational work of some sort probably uses it as well. Linux is a phenomenal success.
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:00:11
It reads to me like "Bitcoin has potential in retail settings but the user experience and training needs to be addressed and refined."
Not long ago, credit cards needed to be run through a machine with a special multi-page form to copy a carbon imprint. Then the imprints had to be submitted to the card company and a copy filed. That experience was unpleasant and required staff training. Actually, some places still do this, and even the ones that don't still have to maintain a relationship with a merchant services provider, keep signed receipts on file, deal with chargebacks and fraud, and pay a transaction fee to cover the costs of all of this.
This is no different, except that once the proper software is developed, it will be easier.
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:36:44
That is exactly valid behavior since the system then does exactly what it's designed to do: throw the transaction out and never confirm it. It has always been clear that you look for the system to validate the tx, and cannot use the tx id. And it doesn't give any free money to anyone who ignores that rule, so the only person hurt by ignoring the rule is the person who did it. E.g. MtGox, screwed by their own faulty implementation and suckered into giving away bitcoin again by people claiming their tx didn't go through.
If I told you my toilet can't flush paper towels and you try it anyway and it doesn't flush, who's fault is that? Serious question.

I don't see any reference to the Bitcoin Foundation in the article.
Really, nobody who gave the subject of taxation any thought imagined that Bitcoin would be classified any differently, and the IRS guidance is just a clarification of existing rules. You can find guidance by tax professionals from way back in this subreddit showing that this is the case. I doubt anyone serious about Bitcoin was surprised or thinks it killed Bitcoin somehow. This was the assumption about how it would work from the beginning.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:24:16

Yikes, guys, I'm not trying to spread FUD or even the common cold. I specifically didn't name Trezor in the OP because it's not really a hardware wallet in the sense that I meant it. I truly want to be educated here, so I'd like to hear about how you can be sure that Trezor really is doing what it says it is. As a reasonably skilled electrical engineer, I'd have no problem opening the thing up and swapping out the CPU, or designing a look-alike device with bad firmware installed. The **average person** would never know the difference. Perhaps it's something fundamental to the process of using it and I just need to understand that, but I suspect others have questions as well. My intent is to learn and to educate.

Doesn't income from transaction fees make this a non-issue?
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:00:49
The issue must be what you define as a bug. If the spec said one thing and bitcoin worked differently, that would be a bug, imho. But bitcoin itself is working exactly as designed and as specified.
Sure, tx malleability might be an undesirable or unwanted attribute in some people's opinions, but calling it a bug is misleading and implies that something is not working as expected.
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:26:54
I believe the profit model shifts to transaction fees as discovering new blocks becomes more difficult. The tx fees go directly to the miners.

@_date: 2014-03-01 17:49:48
Not a direct answer to your question (other comments answer it well) but also consider that getting the best price within a few dollars (and worrying about fees) isn't super important at this stage in the game if you believe bitcoin will significantly increase in value in the long term. Best to just choose a **reputable** exchange that is easy for you to use. And if you hold bitcoin, for the love of all things holy don't keep it in **any** exchange!
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:28:46
Nobody told people to store money in these exchanges. In fact, within a day of me starting to read about how bitcoin works it was clear to me that not storing the money myself was an enormous mistake. Possibly the ENTIRE point of bitcoin is for you to take control of your own holdings and NOT trust it to some unknown other party. This doesn't represent a failure in the free market other than in the sense that members of the free market aren't bothering to take responsibility for themselves where needed.
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:25:06
Yeah, makes sense. But from what I've read, BIP38 is insanely secure, relative to other types of encryption. I'm guessing truecrypt is much easier to brute-force.

Overstock isn't even in the same league as Amazon and isn't a good comparison. Amazon is close to 2 orders of magnitude larger in terms of revenue. Put another way, if Amazon accepts bitcoin for 1-2% of transactions, that's equivalent to Overstock's ENTIRE revenue.
