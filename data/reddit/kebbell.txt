I relate to this so hard, what’s wrong with us
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:45:07
I hope I’m you next year

my dad did this for me back in the day when paypal came out so I could make money selling on eBay. I made sure to track everything so my dad could pay the taxes and all was well. I’m sure no one is going to care who is actually using the account if it’s used responsibly. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:29:43
no I think people are dumb 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:35:14
just bought some btc, expect a dip 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:03:02
people would just rather jump straight to conspiracies, I guess. A system update is a too logical and boring explanation.

their alerts are so unreliable, especially when things are crazy and you need them most. Bitcoin ticker is a little better. And some people write their own scripts if you’re a programmer.

why friday? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:31:05
today is the day

I feel like someone should put together a “how to cash out loads of bitcoin without looking like a drug dealer” guide 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:26:31
these posts never fail to appear when the price surges 
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:55:02
I wonder what it feels like to cancel your huge ass sell order and then watch the market go crazy... 
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:24:41
i like cryptowatch 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:30:11
how long have you been holding?
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:34:19
I’m being punished for selling last night 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:33:57
This is what I was assuming too. I have Chase and haven’t had problems yet, probably because they only care about large sums of money.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:40:42
not “serious” but I’ve been making some money trading, well, more btc I should say, since we’re in a downturn. There’s not much money to make just holding so I thought I’d try out day trading and I’m happy with it. I think if I were able to trade with larger amounts it would be “serious” money for me. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:12:41
yes, more positive news pls
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:04:07
kind of, I’m learning to integrate it into my day though. I make like 1 trade per hour and  briefly check the charts like every 15-30 minuets. I make very conservative trades so I don’t stress myself out and can focus on other things. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:03:51
yup. I kept seeing fake 10-20 btc walls starting at 10k. I hope they’re almost done having fun so my limit orders can go through 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:13:18
is there chart analysis for whale activity? days like today make me crazy lol 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:20:08
I hope everyone is happy with their cheap coins, now let’s get back to 20k 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:50:01
I use gdax on my iphone with safari when I don’t have access to my laptop, works fine
I also like showing people the live charts, they get a kick out of it

same, going on 4 hrs :(
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:09:52
also, as some others pointed out, I’d edit out where you mention the cash value of your investments to avoid making yourself a target. You can redact it to ‘X’ amount if you want to leave it up for others to read
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:23:07
day trading is 20% technical analysis and 80% patience 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:09:33
I figured this was the case... I’m excited for the future implementation anyway, should be exciting 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:35:19
I always unintentionally buy high too, just hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:01:47
I wonder about this too, I think it would actually become useful as a currency at that stage too, it’s just a matter of when. I wonder if it will happen this year? Or 10 years from now? It’s anyone’s guess! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:40:56
baby steps
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:07:36
If you buy with a credit/debit or bank account there’s a delay. I’ve experienced 5-12 day delays, just depends on how many people are buying. If you want it to go through instantly in the future, transfer fiat to coinbase first then buy btc
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:49:38
I usually wait until the price is %20-30 above my entry point before I start gambling with my gains
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:44:38
I compulsively bought at ~7,500 right before a big drop. I guess if I would have waited to buy low I would have made a bit more $$, but I’ve doubled my investment already so I’m not worried about it. I say just go for it and HODL 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:07:03
really? damn
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:12:20
hodl or buy
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:53:05

yeaaa this is some bs

if it makes yall feel better, binance XRP exchange is unresponsive and I’m unable to buy... this is madness 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:03:54
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:09:41
awesome! thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:26:31
where were you to tell me this yesterday
I already got a buy order in place though so hopefully I ca ching soon
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:07:43
oh I did!
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:59:38
Coinbase and other exchanges might be taking a “brokers fee,” the price difference between the buy and sell price, called the spread. The avg of the two prices being the market price. That’s standard in stock trading. 
When you trade using limit orders on gdax that spread fee goes away
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:01:31
aaand we’re ending the day at 16k &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:30:51
ahh ok
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:36:03
between coinbase and gdax it’s free, gdax is owned by coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:51:14
my transfers from Chase have taken between 8-12 days to be complete, I guess it’s just part of the process, not sure why that is
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:19:10
would you mind sharing your code? hah
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:16:24
woke up to see my stop order went through, damn :(

@_date: 2017-12-30 02:38:03
who else is just helplessly watching the price drop? lol :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:08:26
hodl me im scurd 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:40:33
Sounds good, I’m pretty busy for the holidays too. I’ll see if I can find time to whip something up in the meantime, I’m not the best at programming but I’ll give it a shot
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:13:25
yes! The price holds. 
So if the price stays up you’ll see some gains on your initial investment
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:38:30
I think so, its easy to use for beginners imo 
if you want to avoid fees, transfer fiat to gdax and make a limit buy order on the exchange. Then transfer back to your Coinbase wallet for hodling for now. From what I understand transfers from gdax are free, so if you wanna to switch wallets use gdax again for the transfer. 
But if you don’t wanna to mess with gdax you can buy at market price on Coinbase and eat the fee
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:41:08
all these scenarios and you’ll still probably be wrong ��
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:44:38
time 2 buy
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:09:55
I bought at 7.4k and held for dear life 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:26:05
I love this. I don’t think you’ll ever regret being debt free, that’s priceless IMO. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:39:39
tell that to the guy with 100btc 
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:24:40
oh boy
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:23:43
just price manipulation meh
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:19:35
I saw like 7 consecutive 10k walls about 15 mins ago. then 2 50k walls a bit later on. looks like some is playing the market with about a 100btc. I’m so entertained watching this unfold 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:14:06
and here comes a pump! 
I’m enjoying this more than the game last night 
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:30:51

@_date: 2018-02-06 06:03:56
