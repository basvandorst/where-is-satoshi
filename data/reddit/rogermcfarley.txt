Could you afford to lose 20% of your life savings? It's perhaps less likely you'll lose all of it, but it was a huge risk. Decentralised currency will happen one day meaning it will one day be in everyday use for the masses, for now it simply doesn't exist. Crypto now is like a 300 baud modem, it's evolution. No one knows the long term winners here. No one knows who will be Amazon. 
This is crypto now &gt;
The things you take for granted now in computing, you couldn't do even 10 years ago. So in that video they could dial up and connect to another computer, they couldn't do Internet because the infrastructure of the Internet wasn't there for home computing.
Remember computers 10 years ago? Most didn't have SSDs they used hard drives, a bottle neck in computing for decades. I remember my Samsung Galaxy in 2011, slow laggy single core, a load of crap, frustrating. Now smartphones have incredible amounts of technology in them, they're fantastic to use now, they'll be all a load of crap in 5 years time. 
Crypto currently is akin to being in 1984 dialling up Micronet (Prestel) from a council estate in the UK. Look back at 1984, where's the big hitters? Atari, ZX Spectrum, Commodore. All gone. In 1984 no one would know the evolution of computing to where it is now in 2017. The point is learn from the past and know that you don't know the future, just that it's coming (probably) and it won't be quite how you imagined. 
The lessons from this post are, absolutely none of the crypto that exists today could exist in 20 years time, all the big names of today all gone and replaced with better evolutions and definite revolutions.
The question is why would you put 20% of your life saving in to crypto if you definitely couldn't afford to lose it and let's not assume you couldn't.

I'm in UK currently and I bought crypto on the same day I decided to buy in to crypto. I did this using Bittylicious. So whatever works for you. There's always a way. Day 1 and I was invested in crypto.

Crypto has just started. This is 1969 mainframe computing, home computing just a pipe dream, you wait until it gets to 1980's home computing, then you wait until it gets to smartphones and social media. All the big names of the past gone and replaced with the big names of today. There's a long long long way to go yet.

PANIC! Buy bean babies the end of the world is coming! Or is this just Chinese whispers?

Go back and read my post, it's what I said. All the big names of the past gone and replaced. It's happened before and it'll happen again. Where's Commodore now for example?

You're absolutely wrong. I've used the site to invest £1200 in to Crypto in the last month. 
Also coinmarketcap.com never lies &gt;
You can see that Vertcoin is offered as a direct purchase from Bittylicious for example. Bittylicious is 100% genuine, they sell you the coins for a mark up, they make money brokering the coins to you. If you don't want to pay the mark up then wait a week to get verified elsewhere, the choice is yours. I was merely making the point that if you want to invest in Crypto on the 1st day, then you definitely can do as I did and many others.
