Have you watched his presentation on internet of agreements? He definitely is not all buzzwords, if his ideas can take root,[ the world would be a better place to live.](

I think he definitely makes some grand generalizations sometimes, which I think sometimes are helpful, but sometimes they seem a little out of this world. 
Anyways if you're interested, before Vinay came into the crytocurrency field he was working within disaster relief and  humanitarian aid. Here is a TedX talk he held a couple years ago on the subject.
and as I understand it this is still part of his big game.

Have you heard of how he put the blockchain into historical context? How we have gone from databases, to networking databases, with the internet, to now presumably giant databases in the shape of the blockchain, personally I think that puts things into a very clear perspective. 
So any examples of what you think have been pure bullshit?

Either Bitcoin adapts and evolves so it can deal with the entire global economy, or it goes into obscurity and some other blockchain takes it place.
I don't know how fast people transitioned from myspace to facebook, but it can't have been more then five years. The same could happen to bitcoin. 
Maybe bitcoin destiny from now is to just mainly stays as an asset.

Wouldn't you consider that everyone has their own form of ideology, even if they call it by another name, at least how some overruling patterns like shiting, eating and sleeping controls ones personal ideas. 
Any ways maybe I'll take a look at your website, any recommendations of podcast episodes that would be informative?

That was a smug comment. As far as I know tough Andreas understands the potential of the work Vitalik started, so I would doubt he would have the need to school Vitalik about that.

I think we're getting of topic now, but if you want to discuss more about my ideology you can do that at the upcoming Any ways, what do you think about the current state of crypto? Will bitcoin solve its scaling issues? Are there any other potential projects inside the crypto space? Where do you see crypto in five ten years? Let's see if you will share your own crypto-ideology.

I definitely think the potential is there and maybe turing complete will be an unachievable goal, but just focusing on the smart contracts and  the blockchain as a record keeper as well as a structure for the internet of things, in this there is a lot of realistic potential.

I don't believe what you are saying.
