Hey man, that's your perspective. I don't know you've got paid from drugs. But I am not. Let's say I've got hired for HK based crypto exchange and I've got invited from my friend and I have interviewed with them and worked for them. And they wanted to send money with BTC instead of Fiats sometimes. That's what BTC works in the world totally. Should I verify the source of funds of that BTC this case? what the hell is going on the bitfinex again!

Bitfinex requires to deposit 10,000$ USD before trading.

You never heard about this means you are not trading as a pro. I also have no problem at all on other exchanges. but now I've got frustrated on current bitfinex issue.

I already provided them my ID and others they asked.

I don't know about it clearly. I am not a security manager of Bitfinex. however in that case, what happens on my funds? I really want to know it. If part of BTC is related to shady stuff, can I withdraw the rest part of that?

Here's update from Bitfinex. They ask me to explain about my email address.
"Additionally, the email address you are using has an online profile, that doesn't seem to match the identification being submitted. **Please provide a detailed explanation for this discrepancy.** " 
What the hell is going on bitfinex? I am the owner of the email. I am not a hacker indeed. I don't know what's the online profile similar with my email name but should I explain about it? Someone's email address is his personal interest. no reason to explain about it to someone else.

I traded for 4 months with my funds and wanted to withdraw some profits. and now they ask me about the source of funds. What the hell, I read their Terms of Service carefully. There's no explanation of this case.
I don't know what to do.

Is there any site showing some BTC transactions issued by law part of FBI? LOL

I already sent them block explorer which explains the source of funds.
But they are keeping ask me to the documentation of the source of funds. I have no documentation. It's been a long time and I only have BTC address I received. What kind of documentation can I provide to Bitfinex? It's really sucks! I just want to know what's the problem on my BTC deposited to Bitfinex.

Welcome EXMO Official, When deposit any coins to EXMO, what information, data, transactions should users have to keep or store on his computer?
I have verified in many exchanges, but this is the first experience such EXMO.
Is it ok to solve any issue once I'm KYCed as long as I'm legal?
