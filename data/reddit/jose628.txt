What are you talking about? Both GreenAddress and Trezor send from Segwit addresses. That's the whole point in doing the comparison.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:46:46
Don't get me wrong here, I'm not here to say that the core developers are either right or wrong. My point is that Bitcoin has become a project guided by Core's guidelines so it's not absurd to call it Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:23:42
From the top of my head:
1 - An ETA for LN is needed (even if it is 273 days away - that is still preferable to the "soon" and "it will be ready when it's ready" that we've had for the last 2 years.
2 - A plan of action concerning the blocksize. Even if it is something like 2MB in 2019, 10MB in 2035.
Bitcoin users need to know something is being done to improve the protocol/fees situation. I do realize a lot is being done, but without clearer communication/deadlines being proposed it all just seems like promises that may or may not materialize.

Considering Segwit adoption has failed, we really ought to raise the block size instead, not to Bcash standards but to something between 1.6 - 2MB (that was the advantage it would give us).
Unfortunately, I think Core won't do it not because of centralization fears but out of pride/spite. Either we take the solution they gave us or we should just STFU.

What you're saying makes sense. However, it is interesting to see that this line of thinking started being "fashionable" now. Back when Bitcoin had 95% of the market cap, that was taken as a sign it was the only cryptocurrency that mattered.

Without a shadow of doubt it has failed so far.
That doesn't mean that the game can't change. Maybe one fine day we'll wake up to see Segwit being adopted by 97% of users.
But so far, today, January 3rd 2018, it is not a relevant feature. It's like the government saying that electric cars are making the air cleaner.

@_date: 2018-01-07 19:09:35
I'm bringing attention to the fact that a Segwit adoption will never happen if the average user doesn't see any advantage in using a Segwit wallet and we should do something about this issue.
Granted, that is not "solving the problem" but seeing that something is wrong and alerting others of that fact is the first step towards a solution.

Hasn't worked for me, in fact GreenAddress would cost me 4x the average fee (transaction from and to a Segwit address): 
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:59:59
Then how come whatever Core says gets implemented.
Core wants Segwit, Segwit it is.
Core wants 1MB blocks, 1MB blocks it is.
Honest question here: has there ever been some sort of fork/decision/consensus that went against Core beliefs and they just had to accept that?
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:06:17
The $1 transaction was just an example, the fees would be the same for any value. Besides, GreenAddress' fee was $41. Even for a $400 transaction, that would mean that 10% of the value would be lost in fees. Would you call $400 lunch money?

You're absolutely correct from the technical standpoint. 
Yet, real life is not made of theories. If I want to give a friend some "electronic cash" as a Xmas gift, my only option here is to use Bcash. If I give them $50 worth of bitcoin they'll end up with $16, since $17 x 2 will be the fee required for me to give them the $50, and for them to actually use the BTC afterwards.

You'd have more time with 2MB blocks, wouldn't you?

@_date: 2017-12-21 23:51:44
A slippery slope argument (SSA), in logic, critical thinking, political rhetoric, and caselaw, is a consequentialist logical device[1] in which a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect.[2] The core of the slippery slope argument is that a specific decision under debate is likely to result in unintended consequences. The strength of such an argument depends on the warrant, i.e. whether or not one can demonstrate a process that leads to the significant effect. This type of argument is sometimes used as a form of fear mongering, in which the probable consequences of a given action are exaggerated in an attempt to scare the audience. The fallacious sense of "slippery slope" is often used synonymously with continuum fallacy, in that it ignores the possibility of middle ground and assumes a discrete transition from category A to category B.

Agree 100% - LN effectiveness is reliant on L1 factors/variables, and we need to get the balance right. The only concern I have about various L1 increases is the effect on decentralization, because that's what the identity ecosystem we are building revolves entirely around.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:49:30
Question here: 
I'm using  to calculate the fees I'm paying next. For instance, my next transaction will pay 166k because that's what it take to confirm it in 6 blocks.
If I sent some BTC from a SW wallet to a SW wallet what value should I estimate for my fee?
There's no easy way to see how much one can save by adopting a SW wallet and you can see I'm not a complete newb, I'm using data and trying to come up with a low-cost solution for my transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:40:40
This kind of "reasoning" is just plain stupid, bro.
No one in the world (apart from the Bcash morans) thinks "bigger roads" will solve the scalability problem. But they will help in the immediate future before LN comes.
In fact, planning for a bigger blocksize now is necessary, since that will be required if LN really takes off and millions of people are opening/closing channels all the time.

As of this writing, the majority of views on and Twitter seem to take the maximalist, one-size-fits-all approach: that Bitcoin is the only way, the truth and the light.
In contrast, the target audience for the report are decision makers and developers within the financial services industry.  These individuals, based on months of conversations, are more interested in permissioned ledgers for their business needs because all of the parties involved in the transactions are known, have real-world reputations to maintain, have responsibilities which are expressed in a terms-of-service that is contractually binding and are ultimately legally accountable for actions (or inaction).
Cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin, a public good that purposefully lacks a terms of service or accountable validators, were specifically designed not to interface with these organizations and institutions — and intentionally created an expensive method to route around all entities (via proof-of-work).  Thus in practice, it makes some sense that financial institutions may not be interested in Bitcoin as-is.
This may be a problem to maximalists, who have come to create and control a narrative in which Bitcoin can and will disrupt anything and everything that deals with finance and have invested accordingly.  Perhaps it will, but then again, maybe it will not.

Actually, both holders and spenders are needed to make Bitcoin successful. If everyone just wants to store it, value will go down to 0 as you said. However, if everyone just wants to spend it, value will also go down to 0, since there will be no one that businesses can sell it back to, on the end of a purchase.

Project Criteria
New payment systems (NPS) such as Bitcoin, M-PESA, and Kipoche hold the promise of making commerce accessible to millions of people worldwide who have no access to traditional banking systems, and yet they also pose new risks to consumers and new opportunities for nefarious actors to exploit this relatively ungoverned space.  The Seeker is soliciting innovative ideas and insights on future new payment systems and how to foster financial innovation while still allowing for oversight and detection of illegal activity to aid in anti-money laundering and anti-terror financing efforts. 
Submitted proposals along with all relevant supporting data should include the information described in the Detailed Description of the Challenge. 
Submitted proposals should not include any personal identifying information the Solvers do not want to make public, or any information the Solvers may consider as their Intellectual Property they do not want to share. 
This is an Ideation Challenge, which has the following unique features:
There is a guaranteed award.  The awards will be paid to the best submission(s) as solely determined by the Seeker. The total payout will be $15,000, with at least one award being no smaller than $5,000 and no award being smaller than $1,000. 
Submission forwarding occurs during the Challenge.  Since submissions will be forwarded to the Seeker throughout the Challenge, please make sure you upload only a finished proposal. You can submit an updated version of your proposal only as a new submission. If you submit an updated version of your proposal, please clearly indicate the new items and/or edits compared to your previous submission.
