You spout nonsense on threads and insult anyone asking questions. Can't tell if troll or just a fucking idiot.

Whos to say they haven't been selling their BTC the second they get it? I could see them sell off their hardware to recoup part of their investment. If I was a miner in China I would be worried. Why wouldn't China increase it's restrictions and regulations on not just exchanges but the miners themselves? We have to remember that it's still a communistic dictatorship.

lol a simple linear regression of this crash is proving that false. This is in fact crashing DOWN. nice try though.

Seriously. The amount of people calling themselves noobs and then investing more money than they can afford to lose is too high. People think of Bitcoin as a get rich quick market and think they can only make money it they invest.

I'm playing devil's advocate here. Anything can happen in this market  - like we've seen this past week.

Okay little sheep. Everything is okay you're right.

I agree with your first and second point. But the 3rd point is what gets me. This is this certainty that I referred to that floods this sub. Who is saying that it just can't crash? The exact same thing has been said about several markets over the years. Hell look at the housing crisis in 2008. The reason the housing market recovered is due to the fact that humans NEED housing. It's become a crucial part of human evolution. The problem is I can't say the same for bitcoin in it's current state. What's from stopping Chinese miners from cashing out right now? This will lead to a decrease in miners and will actually affect bitcoin itself. While it's unlikely, it can't be ruled out so nonchalantly.
