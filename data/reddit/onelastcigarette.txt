Theoretically sure, but practically it can effectively be  anonymous, if used with that in mind.

Do you think the current user base could be tapped? I should think there'd be a lot of skills available.

Man, slow down with the hyperbole and emphaticals. It's exhausting.

Plenty of possible reasons, for example:

Why so negative?
I see it as running, for all intents and purposes, as a regular exchange. It would still be commercially viable and would continue to grow as Bitcoin does
The only difference is that all the previous Gox customers would be automatic shareholders.
We could even look on it as something along the lines of how credit unions and community banks are run.
I'd encourage practical, constructive comments going forward. We don't need negative speculation.
**Edit:** The more I reread your comment, the more absurd it seems. I think you've misunderstood. Previous traders who lost their money would not suddenly have BTC to trade. They would be shareholder and would receive dividends over (a long) time, up to the value of what they lost. What you suggest would not happen.

If the fees are competitive, it won't make any difference to you.

Classic developer side-stepping there (even though they are partially ~~to mostly~~ correct).
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:05:31


Huge amounts of goodwill for the business and Bitcoin would be generated if it was successful.


It would function just as any other commercial exchange. It would grow as new Bitcoin users come on board. Ex Gox users would simply be shareholders.


Again, it would function no different to competing exchanges. The market would decide.
The rest of your points are valid IMO.
My gut feel is a BTC credit union/non profit would be the likely and advantageous way forward. Gox users could band together to start it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:06:12
100% agreed.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:59:10
The debt gets paid off as dividends. This would be a long term project. It wouldn't be feasible to open an exchange that was not competitive. It has to viable.
If Bitcoin goes as far as we believe it should, it's actually not much of a debt at all.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:59:51
I think  the fees should remain competitive. If Bitcoin takes off as we suspect it will, then revenue won't be a problem.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:14:56
Nope. If they wanted to manipulate, there are far better ways to do it. 
It's a perfectly ordinary kind of comment to find in an HTML page, particularly under these circumstances (i.e mismanaged company, closing or undergoing major structural changes etc.).
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:30:52
What? That was a reasonable comment.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:02:54
Both MtGox and the protocol devs are to blame, for different reasons. MtGox should have programmed more defensively *and* the protocol devs should not be leaving issues like this lying around for so long, especially ones that are potential traps for developers.
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:06:19
Yes. We get it. Some of us are seeing if we can make something good come of this.

We don't have to run the existing software. In this community there'd be a shit ton of development and IT smarts. We could replace existing code, and leverage Open Source projects to do so.

Goodwill for Bitcoin?
Imagine how history would be written if the community pulled it off. It's idealistic I know...
One advantage is that we'd have a huge number of people doing active marketing for the exchange. It would have a narrative... a story, and stories tend to interest people. 
I'm almost certain that if it was competitive price wise, the narrative alone would generate a huge amount of goodwill from new Bitcoin users.
That'd be one significant competitive advantage.
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:32:57
Evidence please.

Wonderful! I just discovered this thread after posting this.
Who's leading the charge?
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:38:48
As a developer, as far as I'm concerned, if an entity has an ID field, it's to be used as an ID field. Since Bitcoin transactions are unique, transaction ID's should also be unique, which implies that the transaction ID should never change. The fact that they can is a problem with the Bitcoin implementation.
On the other hand, it would be very bad practice for someone to design/code a critical system and not do so super defensively (i.e anticipate failures, assume dirty data, implement fallback verification checks etc. *especially* if potential issues are documented). ...And from a business logic perspective (outside of IT), for Gox not to have implemented proper internal accounts/transaction verification is also a huge failure of management.
Both of the above are valid arguments.
Personally I have to put the blame on both Gox and the Bitcoin implementation as it stands.
To quote ReadWriteWeb:
"It may have not been the smartest thing for Mt. Gox to blame a three-year-old glitch for its current problems, especially when nobody else is experiencing the issue. But “we’re working on it” isn’t an acceptable response from the Bitcoin Foundation, either. For Bitcoin to be taken seriously, it can’t just leave vulnerabilities exposed and expect people to work around them." -

It's not truth. It's speculation.
(I am not a non technical person).
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:07:22
However true that might be, you're not helping. It might be bargaining, and it might also turn out to be a lot more than that.
I've accepted the idea that I almost certainly won't be getting back with things as they stand. Might as well look at constructive options.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:44:25




Being unable to imagine what might be possible, also does not change reality.


The people who lost money would effectively receive long term dividends. Is that a bad thing?


There are people here attempting to think of ways to make good out of a bad situation. It may be impossible as you say, but your argument does nothing to prove that.


Again, speculation. Maybe not your money. Bitcoin is only just starting in the scheme of things. Such an exchange would be just another competitive player in the field for new Bitcoin users, with a community narrative. 


We are talking here about a long term big picture plan to turn this story around for Gox users and for Bitcoin going forward. What you suggest is not likely to happen, so there's no point in mentioning it.
Tell me, do you have a better idea for Gox users or are you just going to shit on attempts at coming up with one?
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:50:23
I'd leverage what is available during design and planning. I wasn't saying that there was a project ready to go.
Half a million motivate people is a lot of resources to tap into.
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:25:58
Hmmm... logic.
What backs a currency?
Agreement that it has value.
What backs a fiat currency?
Agreement that it has value.
What backs Bitcoin?
Agreement that it has value.
Logically speaking, Bitcoin and fiat are backed by exactly the same thing (arguably nothing). The only difference between the two (as far as backing goes) lies in the number of people that believe in their value and in who has control over them.
Ad hominem attacks are not equivalent to a "logical line of thought".
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:03:12
What are you talking about? 
* A placeholder comment like that is perfectly reasonable. A junior dev or someone non technical might be responsible for pulling the trigger on an announcement. That comment tells them where to paste the text.
* They might have no reason to hide it. It might be a question of timing the release. They may have planned an announcement for earlier and needed to change that plan.
* What benefit would there be to this kind of manipulation?
* If they wanted to manipulate anything, there would be far more effective means to do so.
The evidence supporting your claim is very weak. There's far to many possible scenarios to jump to your conclusion.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:22:17
You have misunderstood. Previous investors would be shareholder, not magically credited with BTC. Read my edit above.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:25:41
Fair point, but black and white. It's going to require a lot of different input to pull off, including investment.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:56:05
That might end up being the best plan going forward. We're not going to know until we get concrete facts about the situation.
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:34:11
If it was a disaster, or could have been done better, it is not a political agenda. It is objective fact.
A community of open-source developers can protect itself from blatant failures to some degree. A government does not have the same advantage, and clearly, they fail at things all the time.
Sounds like your "Inserted political agenda" could be interpreted as "I don't want to admit that Obamacare was a total disaster as that might be construed as a partisan appraisal and therefore challenge my political views. It might mean uncovering deep cognitive dissonances that I've been hiding from myself, resulting in my political views being open to rational review, which would surely disrupt the emotional responses that usually drive my politics." ... or not.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:55:13
My gut feeling is that a completely new community exchange started by MtGox users might be a better idea to explore.

Indeed,  why would I believe this?  I'm genuinely asking. 
My (naive?) understanding is that the nature of the network itself,  i.e it's fundamental design,  would make it impossible for central control. Considering also that the network majority can,  at any time,  vote to change any emergant vulnerability in the protocol / network itself,  should this ever become a real risk.
The blockchain is decentralised and operates as a "pure" democracy,  i.e it's operation and development is entirely network-driven,  by consensus,  for a reason.
