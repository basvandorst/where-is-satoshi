Because it's inherently deflationary.  Why this isn't talked about more makes no sense to me.

If "misuse of company" assets were a crime there would be plenty of business owners in jail.  He owns an runs the company, any assets he gets can just be accounted for as bonus or dividends.

My point is those things are pretty much opposites and this community thinks Bitcoin is both. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 22:41:27
But I thought Bitcoin was a currency, not a speculative investment. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:29:48
But isn't bitcoin supposed to be a currency?  What you are describing is an investment/commodity.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:28:38
But it's a currency, not a speculative investment, right r/Bitcoin?

Have you tried it recently? It's improved a lot.

Do you actually  believe that?  If you had a large deposit at a bank and that bank defrauded you or went bankrupt you would be covered by insurance.  I don't think this deposit insurance that gets covered by modest bank fees really "harms" people in a significant way, and I'm sure most people see it as a reasonable cost for securing their money.

How do you know this?

It's pretty stupid of the cops to confiscate the money in the first place.
@_date: 2018-10-13 12:25:52
Right but suspecting the operator in this case makes no sense.

Not necessarily.  If the seller and I agree to exchange the CAD there is nothing stopping us.
The asset doesn't matter.  Could be an xbox, a car, etc.
The point is that when you realize the value on the increase on an asset like that it should be taxed and I don't think it's true that it wouldn't apply to a foreign currency if it were exchanged for a non-monetary asset.

Blaming other investors for your asset losing value.  Nice.

The article does a poor job explaining why bitcoin should be except from capital gains tax.
If you consider bitcoin a currency like CAD, Euro, etc. it should be treated like those currencies.  If you converted those into USD for more than USD than you paid you would be realizing a gain and should pay tax, just like bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:22:49
Is that really true?
So if you bought CAD, and it went up 50% relative the USD and bought a house in the US with it you would pay 0 taxes on the 50% increase?  That seems unreasonable.

Lol I find it hilarious how this sub rails against the fiat system while voting up this kind of thing.

Can someone ELI5 this situation?

How is it linked to your IP?  And if it is shouldn't it be fairly easy for law enforcement to track people using silk road etc.?

This is dumb.  I'm a professional accountant who even knows a bit of programming.  (Meaning I'm not a dumbass).
I've looked into getting started with bitcoin and the benefits I would realize and it's not worth the hassle at this point.
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:24:05
Neat.  I always thought one of the bid advantages to bitcoin was that your identity isn't associated with your payments unless you share some bit of information (can't remember the term).
Is that correct, and does using that app eliminate that advantage?
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:21:01
neither do 99% of people
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:51:10
so you get gas money etc. in bitcoin?  What currency do you quote the "price" in?
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:42:07
i agree, but I didn't think that was the topic of this post.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:34:34
When is the last time something comparable to that happened in the traditional banking system?
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:45:03
And did the account holders get their money or was it insured?

I'm sure there are more, but I am too lazy to think about them now.
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:46:47
Stuff like this makes it so obvious that bitcoin will never be any kind of currency.  I mean you expect (and many are hoping for) the value of the currency to jump because of a completely predictable and internal function of it.  That's not something that's tolerable in a currency.
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:37:08
Well this sub seems to disagree.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:07:08
How will it ever be a currency then?
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:37:01
This sums up the delusional beliefs of both Libertarians and Bitcoin fanatics perfectly.

They should have delivered him coins equal to $35,000 in value.  At the exchange rate at the time of delivery like they originally promised and as OP indicated in his email.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:46:18
I tried that one but the prices were higher and there were none actually "local" to me.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:12:59


That makes no sense.  The rationalizations on this sub are a great comedy source.
