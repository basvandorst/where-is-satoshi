Well, you're very wrong, and you'll pay the price for it. It's not worth my time to discuss it further. Bye.

So you don't think that the initiation of force is objectively wrong? You just feel it? Well the statists feel that the initiation of force can be right, so you have no reasons to give them as to why they shouldn't initiate force against you and others. That's a shame.

I recommend this essay, especially up through the part called "There’s No Contradiction Between the NIFP and Monopoly Government":

A lot of rational principles are contextual, including the NIFP. (See [The Nature of the Morality of Rational Egoism: Short Notes]( Point 10)


Without an objective morality, there's no such thing as a truly "innocent" person. (Unless by "innocent," you mean "this person hasn't made me feel bad.") There is no distinction between "innocent" and "guilty" inherent in an individual if there is no objective morality. There are only various people's baseless opinions.
So you're saying it's just a matter of baseless personal opinion whether a serial killer torturing a child is doing something bad? If the serial killer thinks it's morally okay, it's morally okay for him?
