I thought there was a way to route your transactions through a specific node; hence why you would want to run your own full node (besides the altruism of course).
@_date: 2016-08-23 23:50:58
One last question, is that an automatic thing that the node takes care of, or would the user need to manually check to make sure the transaction he is about to receive was logged on the longest/true blockchain?

I think it just clicked.  Some people are saying that in order to scale "successfully", decentralization must be sacrificed a little bit, and others are saying thats not the case, like the link you posted.  Sorry for all the questions, I just want to make sure I'm actually helping out the network.

Cool, thank you.
So basically, the Bitcoin network allows you to mine in any way you want, but obviously miners are going to use the most efficient method out there.  It looks like this "stratum protocol" is an industry best practice to mine.  And that, basically (I'll read more into it here soon), this protocol serves up individual machines within a linked pool different templates that mitigate or eliminate the possibility of a duplicate guess.  True?  If so (probably my last question), do pools that include geographically distant machines use this protocol as well, implying that the distribution of these templates is efficient and worth it to each machine?

Very thorough!  I've been looking for a condensed but detailed description of the block size debate and the Lightning Network, and your post really helped me understand!  I especially liked [this link]( very informative!
Now I know your post was mainly about a solution and not necessarily the problem, but I'm still failing to grasp what the debate actually is and what the two main sides are.  From what I understand, there is a rift in the community about how Bitcoin can scale successfully.  Some think the Lightning Network is a possible solution, some want to keep the blocksize small, and others want to increase it.  Is there a post you can link me to that succinctly details the problem, much like your post did for a possible solution?  Or even just a paragraph explanation?
Either way, great post!  Thanks for writing it up and explaining a lot of those concepts very well!

I just started and have bought some BTC off of Coinbase.  I understand the general premise of BTC and am generally good with technology, but with everything that's happened with MT GOX I don't want to store my BTC on Coinbase's site.  But I am also afraid of screwing up the transfer of BTC or giving it to a wallet that could be malware.  Can anybody suggest a safe utility to store my BTC on my hard drive while also having an online back up?

Couldn't you do this with a regular paper wallet though?
@_date: 2016-03-31 10:54:01
Hmmm, I guess.
I mean, that'd only really work if you'd keep the Opendime after you cracked it.  I feel like most people wouldn't, and why would they?
If someone were selling a car and accepted a paper wallet as payment, they'd most likely verify and then sweep the contents of the wallet before handing over the keys.  With an Opendime, you would still want to verify the contents of the wallet before handing over the keys, although you could sweep the contents at your leisure.
Although after typing this out, the Opendime does have one major advantage regarding plausibility, which I guess was your original point; a paper wallet is highly unlikely to have more than one original owner, for the reason you listed, meaning you are much more likely to know the source of the bitcoins in the paper wallet, as opposed to an Opendime which could plausibly have more than one contributor.

Copied from my other response.
Ah I see.
Search for a "qr code generator".  It doesn't need to be bitcoin specific.  Paste the intended recipient's address into the generator.  Save the image or take a screenshot.  Double check, using your phone, that the qr code came out correctly.  If it did, use the picture or screenshot at the ATM.
I advise against this though because, outside of the physical receipt you'll receive, you can't prove you ever owned the btc.  But, the above will work.
@_date: 2018-10-16 06:16:43
My other reply to you kinda went into it a bit but basically, they take an input that people may use often for a key pair generator, generate that key pair themselves with that input, and monitor the address with a program.  When the program detects that the address will receive some coins, it is programmed to automatically send the coins to an address that the observer owns.

The BTCPay server makes the most sense.  But it may take some time to get the server set up and the necessary equipment.
This is what I would do in the meantime.  Should take no more than 10 minutes.
1.  Create an HD wallet.  In most wallet software nowadays, this is the default setting.  Basically, anytime he sends or receives btc, the wallet software will generate a new address for him.  This protects his privacy.  All of this is done in the background.  I would use a hardware wallet like [Trezor]( or [Ledger]( as they are the most secure way of conveniently storing btc.  But if he doesn't want to get a hardware wallet, [Mycelium]( or [Samourai]( are my two favorite Android wallets, and I hear [BRD]( is a good iPhone wallet.  Make sure he backs up his wallet by writing down the 12 or 24 words the wallet gives him.  This word list will restore his wallet, so he has to keep it safe.  If someone else gets this word list, they can steal his coins.
2.  If he has an Android, download [Sentinel]( and import his xpub key taking it from his bitcoin wallet you downloaded in Step 1.  Anytime he wants to accept payment, he'll open Sentinel, hit "deposit", and enter how much money he wants for the service he provided.  Sentinel will automatically take care of displaying the address with the correct amount requested.  All the customer needs to do is scan the qr code and send the transaction.
3.  Set up an exchange account.  He will need to set up an exchange account at an exchange.  I like [Gemini]( but you can use any exchange that deals with the fiat of your country.
4.  However often he wants, he'll send btc from his wallet to his exchange account.  I use [this website]( to best determine what fee I should send, but he can just let the wallet choose a fee automatically, especially if he's only cashing out once a week or once a month.
Good luck!

You know the 12 or 24 words you are asked to write down before the creation of a wallet?  These are entropy, or, randomness.  They create the public/private key pair.
Brain wallets were somewhat popular because of a unique feature they have; you can completely get rid of any physical evidence of a bitcoin wallet, thus making them popular amongst the most privacy conscious users.
Imagine you created a wallet on your mobile phone app, but instead of writing the words down, you remembered them instead and deleted the wallet from your phone (while keeping the qr code/string for the public address).  You could have people send to that public address with absolutely no risk of theft.  There is no physical device to hack or steal, no wordlist to copy.  When you want to move your coins, you simply download another wallet app and input the words from memory.
Those 12 or 24 words random inputs into an algorithm that produces the public/private key pair. We use them because 1) they are standardized amongst most wallets 2) they're generation in wallet software is (supposedly) random enough 3) they are easy for humans to remember and read.  But we don't technically have to use the word list.  There are programs out there that allow you to enter your own entropy to get your own public/private key pair.  You can do this in a variety of ways.  Dice rolls, coin flips, the order of a deck of cards, these all represent good ways of generating truly random entropy.  Anything can be input into the algorithm to produce the public/private key pair, but if it wasnt produced with good entropy (ie, you input just your bank pin), it is possible your key pair could be guessed by a computer or human, thus losing access to your coins.
Aside from the obvious downside (forgetting the words), brainwallets are discouraged because humans are pretty bad at picking something at random.  You may think you picked 12 random words from a dictionary, but unless you had a computer pick them for you, you most likely did not.  Or, you use the text from your favorite poem as the inputs into the key generator (I actually remember seeing this posted probably 5 years ago).  You think, "this poem is 300 words long, nothing could guess a passphrase that long".  It's true, a 300 word passphrase would take forever to crack, but, there are bots out there that comb through all published material and input it into these key pair generators.  Because your 300 words weren't picked at random, they have a chance of being cracked.  If i remember correctly, the user had his French translated version of an old African poem from the 1800s cracked.
If you do go about creating a brainwallet, it is very important that you use true randomness.  This makes it harder to remember (thus, defeating a huge benefit of the brainwallet setup), but just as secure as a trezor generated key pair.

It wouldn't be illegal (as long as you didn't lie to the person giving you the loan), but yes it is I'll advised.  You shouldn't invest more than you are willing to lose.  Being overinvested makes you emotional and irrational about your investment.
That being said, if you were willing to accept the risks and had a guaranteed ability to pay off the loan as described in your loan agreement, why not?  If you understand what you are doing, can pay back the loan using traditional means, can remain rational if your investment tanks, and you still want to do this, it wouldn't be the end of the world.

It has a 12 or 24 word seed as well, like Mycelium.  If you lose your Trezor or it gets destroyed, you can restore your wallet using those words.

In HD wallets, yes, there are multiple key pairs, but a brainwallet is just one address, and back when they were popular, HD wallets weren't common yet.  And even in HD wallets, there is still only one set of entropy that all key pairs are derived from, which was more the point of my explanation.
And yes, the private key is generated first, but popular lexicon is public/private.  I actually originally had it written private/public but changed it to fit.  But you're right, it's worth saying "oddly" because it does more accurately portray the order in which they are generated.

Yes, you don't want to misrepresent what you need the money for.  They may give you a better rate depending on what you are buying.  A car can be repossessed, lowering the bank's risk of losing all of the loaned money.  Bitcoin worth $0 can't be repossessed, increasing the bank's risk, thus increasing the interest rate.  I'm not a lawyer, but I imagine lying about what the loan is for would be fraud.
If you know you can make the monthly payments and can accept the risk, look into credit card balance transfer promotions.  A balance transfer is basically a loan you take out against your own credit card.  Say you have a credit card with a limit of $1000.  Some cards let you initiate a balance transfer for a fee.  This will deposit up to $1000 into a bank account of your choice (minus fee).  Usually, this balance transfer is subject to the same or similar interest rates as using your card normally, and the fee can be up to 5% on top of that.  But if you have good credit, you may get credit card promotions offering interest free balance transfers for up to 15 months, sometimes even with the fee waived as well.  This is a cheap way to take out a "loan" without having to declare what it is.  You pay this off monthly like a normal credit card bill.
A warning though, you almost always have to pay back the full amount before the interest kicks in, otherwise you are charged interest for the original balance, not what is left.  Meaning, if you took out a balance transfer for $10000 at 20% yearly interest that was only interest free for 12 months, and 12 months later, you only had to $10 left on the balance, you'd still be hit with a $2000 interest bill.  But if you budget correctly and have a pretty secure job, this is an easy and cheap way to get a "loan".

So the subscription mentions you get the most recent version for as long as it's active.  Does this mean if a 3rd version of hardware came out, a subscriber would be shipped one for no additional cost besides the subscription they are already paying?
If someone wants to run their own lightning node, but just as a hobby/for fun/open up channels to help the network, is this much better than just building it from scratch?
If Casa, the business, ceases to exist, would this piece of hardware still work on the LN?

It does sound like once you receive the hardware, you can stop the subscription.

One thing I've been mulling over in my head that may be perfect for this.  The Tor Project, I think (it's been years since I researched this) helps public libraries set up Tor exit nodes in support of free speech.  I think a similar concept with Bitcoin full nodes/lightning nodes would work as well.  Helping non profits like public libraries (maybe chamber of commerce or nich tech stores as well) run full nodes would be super cool.

If you know the risks of keeping 50 percent plus of your salary in Bitcoin and accept it as worth it, then go for it.  But get a hardware wallet.  For more than a few hundred bucks they are really worth the peace of mind they afford.  I like Trezor but Ledger I hear is good too.  Never heard of Lumi.

Yes, you have the right flow down, but it's generally advised that you avoid web wallets (blockchain.info).  Funds have been lost before using them.  You should download a mobile wallet and send the funds there (after backing it up (by writing down the word list it presents you)) instead of blockchain.info.

Bitcoin is secure, but when you use a web wallet, you are trusting them to keep your bitcoin safe, specifically the private keys or the entropy used to create the private keys.
Here are a few threads describing the issues in more detail, but basically, if you use a wallet that only you control, you are safe, and for your use case, a mobile wallet works perfectly fine.
And to answer a question you had above, Coinbase could close your account if they detect you are depositing from a known gambling address.  You are doing the right thing by using an intermediary address first.

I believe is referring to the first chart and how long it would take for a block to be mined, not the size.  My guess would be it would have something to do with the hardware maybe, or block propogation time, if that's how the data was collected, but I don't really know to be honest, it's an interesting question.

How do you propose we get to the point where things are priced in btc then?  From what I understand, it's when a currency has stabilized that people will start accepting btc for btc.  And it can't really stabilize until it's been mass adopted.
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:09:15
Even if that happens, I think it is likely we would see [Gresham's law]( in action.  Given the scenario you describe, btc could still be a tremendous store of value, with people only cashing out to exchange for a more circulated currency when they need to.  Their wealth would still be protected.
And if it came down to it, a hardfork could be introduced to increase the coin supply, but I wouldn't advocate for that myself.

Why it was originally created in the first place; to allow people to take their financial sovereignty back.  Cyprus in 2013 implemented negative interest rates, allowing the government to take money straight out of citizens savings accounts.  Btc spiked at that time.  It is more than just gold.  It is secured by math, it can't be counterfeited or stolen (as long as you secure your private keys).  It is pseudo anonymous and can be transferred to anyone with relative ease and cheaply, without any 3rd party needing to give permission.

I get what you're saying, but a few things.


He was using the LN so no network fee was paid and no blockchain space was used.


Maybe so, and if he really was buying back btc from the merchant he gave it to in the first place, then yes it's a convoluted process.  But in reality he is most likely buying btc back from a holder who is looking to take profit.  Buy paying with btc, you are encouraging adoption.  You are showing merchants that it is worth offering as a payment method.  This is the real benefit to paying with btc at the moment.

You're right, it was inaccurate to say "no network fee", as there is one to open and close a channel.  I just meant in that particular instance.
Until fiat is phased out completely though, this method of trading then replenishing is the best we have.  It encourages using btc as a means of exchange, even if it is only being used as an IOU for fiat.

Maybe once the last few BTC have been mined, most miners will get out of the game because transaction fees alone won't pay for all their energy costs, the difficulty will lower naturally, and home miners can contribute more easily.  Is this kind of the accepted course of action?

But not changing the display address wouldn't keep you from spending any BTC sent there right?  Your wallet software would still have the private key of the old address.  I'm mostly worried about making a mistake in accepting BTC with an HD wallet and losing access to the funds.

I understand that, and I've used it too.  I agree that the problems he's having are most likely from his fee settings, but he didn't know that before hand (seemingly) and has gotten feedback on that.  Sort of the purpose of a stress test yes?  I'm just saying he's not doing it maliciously.
@_date: 2015-09-28 18:01:08
How does having an HD wallet and posting a public address to receive donations or payment work?  Since you use a new address every time you send or receive bitcoins, wouldn't you have to update the display address you want people to send money to?  What mechanism is in play here that keeps you from losing bitcoins sent to an old address that was once part of your HD seed?
@_date: 2015-09-21 16:06:24
If one block is mined every ten minutes, and all transactions are included in that block along with transaction fees, what incentive is there for say someone to run a personal miner in their house if they have almost no computing power compared to big mining farms?  Wouldn't the market in the future be dominated by big server farms because they are the only ones that can handle the difficulty, thereby centralizing the ability to order transactions?  What am I missing?
@_date: 2015-09-28 18:22:08
So if I have 1BTC on my most "current" address and 0.5BTC sent to an "older" address (all from the same HD seed), my wallet client would function as if I had 1.5BTC total in one address?
If so, doesn't that defeat the purpose of an HD wallet by linking an old address with a new one?

Its software that is in beta.  Any sort of test is good, especially when accompanied by a transparent record of what is going.  When beta testing software you test all sorts of things, including things most people wouldn't think to do.
Until there is proof of that, that is a rediculous claim to make.  Besides, even if it's true, the LN needs to be attacked so we can prove it is able to withstand such attacks.  If him messing around with the settings on his own node or withdrawing his own money cripples the LN, it is better to know that sooner rather than later.

Reddit (I think) only keeps the last 1000 of a thing.  Your last 1000 submissions, your last 1000 comments, your last 1000 saves (annoyingly).  I guess user name mentions would fall under the category of "comments" and not their own category.
Looking at [this website]( with your username plugged in, it looks like it only goes back 18 months.

Ideally bitcoin wouldn't be trackable like this through taproot, CT, or some other fungiblity tool.

I believe you are talking about an HD wallet, like Mycelium.
When you first set up your wallet, it generated a random seed.  This seed is what every public/private key-pair is based off of (which is why you can back it up with a word list).  Every time you send or receive btc, your wallet generates a new public/private key-pair.  It does this for security and privacy reasons outlined [here](
The wallet combines these different "accounts" as you put it, for ease of use for the user.  But in reality, nothing is actually combined on the blockchain by the wallet.
Say in your HD Wallet, you have received 1 btc two times, for a total of 2 btc.  Your wallet will show you a balance of 2 btc because it has access to both private keys, giving you 2 btc.  But in reality, and on the blockchain, you have to addresses with 1 btc each.
I hope this helps.
Edit: To clarify, even if your wallet is "combining" address balances, you would still need to pay a transaction fee like normal to spend from them.

Same here, but Gemini doesn't batch transactions or support segwit.  They also upped their fee from 0.25% to 1%.  Normal Coinbase now allows you to buy instantly after initiating an ACH transfer.  If there was a way to do so on Coinbase Pro, depending on the exchange rate, they'd be the cheapest way to buy bitcoin.

An airgapped machine is one that never touches the internet.  If it never connects to the internet, it is impossible to hack without being accessed physically.
You'd use an airgapped pc to hold your private keys.  When you wanted to spend some btc, you'd sign a message using your airgapped pc, transfer the signed message (a file) to a pc that is online, using a CD or USB.  This online pc, with the right wallet software, can transmit the signed transaction to the blockchain.
It works, but personally I prefer the convenience of a hardware wallet, like Trezor.

Their motive would be to tarnish his reputation.  Yes, he set up a program that allowed people to trade for drugs, and that is illegal (conspiracy I'm pretty sure), but if that's all they can pin on him, he doesn't seem all that bad.  He never touched any product or even knows the real identity of the people using his site.  By making it seem like he's masterminding murders, they can make it more palatable to a jury to find him guilty of the more innocuous charge of being a website administrator.
That's a real good point about lining up bitcoin transactions with timestamps of the chat logs, but that begs the question, why has that not been done yet?  I've never heard of any evidence pointing to this, and if it existed, it would be a slam dunk to prove it was Ross.
