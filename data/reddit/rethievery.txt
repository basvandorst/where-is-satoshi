Confirmed the 0.021 BTC wound up in my hands. I can't confirm the remainder of the 0.4. Please post the wallet address to which you would like the BTC sent and verify.

I won't argue with crazy. Most folks into bitcoin lean that way. I don't feel banned.
@_date: 2014-06-09 21:11:04
Please verify.

I'm pretty good at finding the right people and right things on the internet. There are tons of malicious bitcoin stealing software available. It took me about 4 hours to find it.
@_date: 2014-06-09 05:55:03
Just a little AssBurgery.

I can tell you that if someone is actively crawling for wallet data on your machine, that there is a tool available for purchase that proved itself quite useful. I don't think Best Buy is currently stocking though.

BTC is going to be a nice bonus for you at the end of the month. Congrats on a smart decision.
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:25:44
Now if we could just find those Gox coins...
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:34:54
Huh? What has been getting deleted?
@_date: 2014-06-09 04:59:07
What is the transaction ID if you don't mind? I might be able to find a few bits and pieces. I'm guessing you're address was the 18dgM2...? On 4/14/14?
If I'm right 0.01001087 of your funds went to: 1Hnv35RFHxLtvnRL72D3BAwWSaQvWp1rgm
If so, then I have a present for you. It ain't much but it's a start. You need to research where your outputs went and get back to me. I may be able to make you whole again (at least partial).
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:45:08
Yes, and I will be as long as it stays up.
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:45:35
I just followed the directions that were given to me. I already had a fake wallet.dat file on my computer. It was not an executable file. It was silly jibberish just to monitor any attempted access. 
I'd never so much as installed qt or multibit on a windows machine before this incident. This fellows tool did the work. I'm not a super hacker or even a hacker. It should be noted that this was successful with multibit. So I didn't really "do" anything. Sorry for the confusion.
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:17:07
Bring it.
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:47:17
Very easily.
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:29:33
I'm not seeing 0.4BTC. I see 0.021 BTC. Are you saying that you did not perform transaction:
 316d7df7ea81b7a6ca900f66745f70f5f9a5ed2ef2893124407633f29d6853e0
The person that got those coins was doing a lot of coin mixing on tiny amounts. 
I'm looking into this. What type of wallet were you using?
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:53:53
I stopped doing the localbitcoins thing when cops started arresting the guy with the BTC for whatever the hell the cop wanted to contrive they were going to do with it. 
Unless you need the juice from the deal to live on, I'd just buy and hold until a safer avenue for buying and selling BTC comes along. 
I stick with exchanges, escrow, and Western Union/Moneygram now. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:43:49
Isn't that interesting. Hopefully it will get left to its own merits. 
I have one confirmed no, and a definite maybe so far. The "maybe" below was claiming a 0.4 loss on a 0.021 balance.  
@_date: 2014-06-09 06:07:23
Fearing that I was opening myself up to further attack; I scrapped that machine, swapped HD's, and installed a clean OS.
Windows Machine
Certain ports are open
Multibit is installed
Create addresses
Run software
I won't be sharing any more information due to ignorance and the risk of spreading FUD.
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:14:34
LOL. I have a feeling that time will come, but I'd rather not do that. I also wouldn't tell you any other public key that I didn't want to either send or receive from.
Like I said earlier; I'm going to wait for the first victim to come forward. The proof will be in that pudding. 
I have a feeling that most people that store their BTC in the manner in which these were stolen are not avid bitcoiners. Let's give this some time. 
Thanks for the upvote, but that is not the reason I am here.

Bitcointalk does not allow registration from tor.

He/She was closer than a friend and understood fully my stringent data security policy inside MY home. You make the rules at your house, and I'll handle mine. Deal? 
My father greeted me with a pistol in hand when I drove a different car to his home the other night. It's his policy at that hour of the evening in his neck of the woods. I gave him a hug upon arrival. Maybe it's genetic?
My machines that run windows are throw away entertainment boxes on which I'd freely share all information and activity with everyone; so I had no qualms about it. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:20:17
I don't feel that I have committed a crime. Someone requested a file from my computer, used 75% of my system resources doing God knows what, and caused a great deal of strife in my home. If a perpetrator wants to do those things, they have what is coming to them. 
I, on the other hand, am attempting to return things that do not belong to me. If that's a crime, then call 911 like I did.
Did you lose 1 bitcoin to a hacker/thief? If not, then please do not beg here. This is for legitimate claims only.
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:16:51
LMAO. Been unplugged from TV for years now, but always laughed when Horatio would slowly remove his shades and whisper-grunt, "not on my watch,"...twice.
I knew the internet was a two way street, but never thought of re-hacking. I don't have the technical ability, and I don't really have anything of value on my internet connected devices.
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:26:48
Let's wait for the first beggar or actual victim to come forward first. The initial thefts were so small or shared txs. Hell, I don't know. 
All I know about BTC is that I started buying in early '13, and I'd be pissed if someone took my things. If anyone lost things, let me know.
Someone needs to post this on bitcointalk.org. I'd be doxxed if I did it myself.
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:54:21
Yup.
