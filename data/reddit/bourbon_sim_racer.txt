New batch of s9's available today, possibly converting btc to bch to place large orders? Or we talking way bigger values ?

Unless you need to buy more than $500 a week, i would be waiting for months on end to buy all the coins i want. So im paying a premium on btc markets to buy them all at once, which should turn out more profitable considering the potential rise in value over the next few months

Right, because using Monero means random people such as OP can't track your every move... meaning you couldn't brag about all your lambo's? Please name one reason it is a terrible idea.

When 0.1 bitcoin = lambo

I’ll start with your original question, yes with $1000 you can buy enough equipment to do a whole range of jobs at an hourly rate and make $500 - $1000 a month from that point forward quite easily. For example, you could buy a lawn mower and some related equipment, at $20 per lawn (roughly an hour?) you only need to work 6 hours a week to make $500 a month. At $50 per lawn that’s only 3 hours a week. As for bitcoin, you should be able to spare $100, buy some so you scratch the itch but just hold and enjoy, buy some more if you are doing well.

Very informative article, it really delves down into the core of what bitcoin is trying to achieve , besides who could pass up such a juicy prediction of your 0.01 bitcoin quadrupling and having enough money to buy 3 Big Macs

Just don’t, what are you trying to achieve? You want to invest now to catch the massive bull run to 100k so you can make 50 bucks? No. Wanting to buy something with bitcoin? Then go right ahead price doesn’t matter in this case

Yes there is a chance, maybe not in the next 3 years. Remember we are trying to replace fiat, the white paper has it front and centre, a peer to peer CASH system yet everyone is on the bandwagon that bitcoin is the new gold, or new store of value. That’s because that’s all bitcoin can be. It can’t be used as cash because no one would make their bank accounts public. So a coin can take over number 1 spot if it has the same properties as cash, namely fungibility, which bitcoin can only dream of. Also what is your measure of  ? Market cap? Activity? Real world usage ? Adoption? Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere but it’s also not solving all our needs

Good luck sir, you are going to need it

How would we go about purging them from the network? What does that even mean?

Exactly, it was always meant to be a currency and that’s what we should be focusing instead of trying to save face with excuses. People were ready for bitcoin everyone was excited it was all over the news everyone wanted to buy some, and then came the start of the downfall. 
“You mean it’s not as easy as PayPal? And if I forget my password I lose all my money forever!?”.  3 months later they are really happy they didn’t go through the hassle of getting that butcoin stuff. Today everyone expects a one button solution, the closer we can get to this the more adoption we’ll get and back on track. 
All these people going on about store of value. Tell me who would be fine depositing $20k into a bank only to log in to your account 3months later to see a balance of $fuckall. If banks are our current preferred store of value, bitcoin looks laughable as an alternative. Yes it has all the fancy tech and security but people are way more practical when it comes to money.
Ps I’m a holder, I just don’t try to fool myself that while all the savings I could afford to lose, is actually gone but somehow I’ve done a great job storing it... no I lost it and it’s nowhere to be found. I’ll wait the 10 years it will take to recover my money and unless the above problems are fixed I’ll be getting the hell out and using it for transactions only.

Are you asking if your software wallet will suffice as your hardware wallet? I think the answer is no.
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:44:56
Tried to do a bit of “trading” did you?
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:41:22
Bitcoin is not private. If you are serious about the privacy part there are other coins that claim this, and one of them is the clear choice at the moment

I think it shows the nature of humans
