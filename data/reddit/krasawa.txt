Did you do some verification of your person on coinable 4 year ago to register your account there?

When it stops to be so volatile 
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:53:34
Yeah, you a right. It should read: It is a sign, not it is a *good* sign.

Before the interest fell down to 0 and banks gave you 3-4% for just using your money without any risk, it works for a lot of Germans. Now they are searching for other options, because as everywhere you get only 0,25% for your money.
Also you have to know the most of Germans are not buy houses/flat but rent it.

Well, I don't think so. For people who have a normal job and are between 25 and x years old 4000 $ is not a big investment.

There is no hype in the other media yet. The mass media opinion is always the same in Germany: sceptical but not negative. However I was pretty glad as I have recognised that the a little bit conservative channel ARD reported about the Bitcoin.

You a right - Germans find stocks too risky and better bring their money to the bank.

Sorry but it does not make sense. Kraken says they tries to protect users from fraud. So by blocking the withdrawal for 72h they should block amount that are to high.
So for what it should be good to let users withdraw more than 3,557.4125 EUR?
And you can not read anywhere about the 72h rule neither by the registration nor in the FAQ

Indeed. The thing is I think it is a good sign that BTC is going in to the mass.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:46:23
On the other side Germans are very careful and sparingly with money

The same is for me. Sometimes I think I am in the kindergarden with kids ~16 years old.

I would not rely on the human memory skills regarding big money business. A lot of things could happen to a human like a car accident. This could probably lead to a completely lost of the seed in memory. For me it is better to write it down and put it into the safe in the bank.

Good point, thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:15:23
Do you have a source?
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:17:19
Vodka for crisis and red bull for rises.

If you are looking for facts you need to invest your time to analyse and understand the technical information from bitcoin developer community. Here you go with the BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals)  on GitHub.  Look into the different BIP document timestamps. This way you know which BIP is currently in edit or in discussion.

Better you forget your favorite OS because there is no MS Support any more available for it

So you are going to wait until you will be hacked because win7 is unsecure?
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:57:27
Yes, I do!
