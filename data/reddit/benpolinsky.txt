Yo I hate to be this dude.  I just spun out on the highway two days ago.  Very very lucky.  
Pay attention to the road and be safe!

Don't use this username too much.
Old tires.  Slick roads.  Mind wandering a bit, not on phone though.

**The virtual currency bitcoin made it through a closely watched technical milestone with a 2% decline.**
The price of the alternative currency, measured in dollars, dipped Saturday in light trading by about 4%, but then recovered some ground to trade only about 2% lower than it did early in the day, according to bitcoin tracker Coindesk.
In recent months, a run-up in the price of bitcoin was attributed in part to the “halving” that arrived Saturday. That effectively cuts by 50% the rate of production of new bitcoins. In theory, that makes existing bitcoin more valuable.
The preprogrammed “halving” that took place shortly after noon Eastern time Saturday cuts the monetary reward that network operators receive for contributing computing power to the bitcoin network.
A 2% decline in bitcoin’s price to about $645.16 Sunday afternoon Eastern time from about $660 early Saturday isn’t much of a swing for bitcoin, which sometimes bounces around 5% or 10% in a single day.
Since late last year, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled from levels below $300. But it is still well off its high above $1,000 a few years ago.
Bitcoin has captured the interest of some investors who historically gravitated to gold as a hedge against unstable markets. But the currency’s popularity has been hindered by technical problems and cybersecurity issues tied to platforms that trade the currency.
Under bitcoin’s design, the halving happens roughly every four years. It helps prevent too many coins from being created too quickly.
Bitcoin was designed to run without middlemen or a centralized oversight like a central bank or national government. Rather than a network controlled by any one group on centralized servers, it operates across a web of computers.
