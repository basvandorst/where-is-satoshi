So how much do you think a bitcoin is worth?

Wait, wasn't MtGox Roger-Verified by who looked at bank statements and stuff? Which ones was he looking at?
Are you telling me that the audit firm is not a trustworthy organization?

You need to go on BitstampXT.

It was restricted because Karpeles was using a personal bank account to operate a fucking financial organization. That's not a limitation of the traditional banking system.

It was known from day one, to all, that "Magic the Gathering Online Exchange" was a completely unregulated exchange developed in PHP by a kid with neither credential nor experience in the financial and technology industries.

Yes, I do have similar limitations on my personal bank account.

Paypal, the company, is valuable. And you can value that company based on the profit it generates.

It's blatantly illegal under the law of virtually every country in the world, but who cares about statist regulations anyway?

Nothing whatsoever. There is no particular reason for one coin to be worth $300 and not $25 or $9,000.
The first guy who traded bitcoins had the idea that it was not worth much, so he settled for something like 10 cents per coin (completely arbitrary). It could have been 10 cents per satoshi, or 1 dollar per coin or whatever.
From there, speculators thought: "ah, it's probably worth more!" Note that those are purely "psychological" numbers: it stopped at around $1,000 because people thought: "holy crap, it went to one thousand!". But it could have stopped at $3,293 or $82.
Unlike currencies that can be valued through PPP and stocks and other financial assets that can be valued through DCF, there is nothing whatsoever driving the fair value of a coin.

Which Bitcoin? The old one or the new one?

You've explained how an order book-based exchange works (how people trade stocks today, and how people actually traded tulip bulbs and tulip bulb futures in Amsterdam during the tulip mania).
What we're interested in is how you value those things (stocks, tulib bulbs or bitcoins).

Usually they go a bit beyond saying: "we've seen statements indicating fiat assets".
Basically what Roger Ver "audited" was that MtGox had a bank account (apparently Mark Karpeles' own bank account). Duh.
@_date: 2015-07-25 05:47:50
That's most likely what will happen, yes.

Shlaboola is by far the most efficient organic apple cider-powered value transfer network.

Not really. Some people bought expensive Enron stock right before we discovered it was actually worthless.
