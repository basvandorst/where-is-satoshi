Cryptocurrency is heavily influenced by one another.
The entire thing is being propped up by confidence in market expansion.
That's why when one cryptocurrency dips in value, all of them dip as well. It's also why Bitcoins value skyrocketed in 2017 even tho less vendor accepted it as a currency than the year before.
When the Tethers implode (which they will), how confident do you think people will be in the future of digital currencies when onlookers find out that billions of dollars in crytocurrency was literally made out of thin air without anything tangible to tie it to the real world? 
From the outside, it look like a pyramid scheme. Except there's not to of the pyramid, it's like a weird tesseract scheme where the only people who make money are the ones who convince dumb people that's throwing your mortgage into internet bucks is a great idea.

These aren't momentary price fluctuations. What's happening to bitcoin is the same exact thing that happened with the dotcom bubble.
There was a huge explosion in interest, the people who invested early got super rich and the people who invested late got shafted. A few billionaires, a whole lot of loser. It's the life cycle of every new market.
In the long term, Bitcoin will stabilize but you would be absolutely insane to believe it will stabilize past the pre-Tether value never made continuing to increase in value for the rest of time.

Why would you keep holding at this point?
These aren't company stocks that pay out dividends over time.

I don't know why people think it's going to rise again when the market is being flooded with Tethers

The technology of Bitcoin was never in question.
No one is saying it will disappear as a technology. That's a completely separate issue from whether or not it have any real value aside from illicit purchases over the internet.
The entire reason Bitcoin has value right now is because of a massive flood of interest in cryptocurrency. If interest or confidence in that collapses, it will take Bitcoin with it.
Bitcoin isn't the petrodollar where if one nations currency collapses, the USD will be fine because it's value is tied to a natural resource.
