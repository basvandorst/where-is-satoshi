Interesting, will give it a shot. Thank you

Its gone from that graph area for me, but visible in other places. And yeh, it said 0 at one point
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:46:05
They might be, but see one thing I am trying to figure out with it, is say if it becomes very popular and needs to handle like 1000 transactions per second, that is somewhere between 142mb per block I think? surely in one year blockchain size will become massive, like peta bytes and it will be so expensive to set up a full node that has record of full ledger. Maybe they have nodes that can be set up in a way that only keep records for 3 months or something? But in my opinion that conflicts with idea where everyone can easily check all transaction records. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:47:22
Yep, by default when you set up a lightning node and someone uses it, you get a fee, you can open a lot of channels.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:36:11
you don't have to and all that node does is propogate your transaction, if it doesn't just switch paayment chanel to other node. There is no incentive to not propogate transactions as nodes will loose fees
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:43:02
1) Funds are never stored on it, they are on the main blockchain, think of it this way: You commit 1 BTC to lightning network, it still stays in your wallet, you spend 0.5BTC on lightning networks payment channel (You still have 1BTC on main chain). Until you or your partner close the channel 0.5BTC won't be deducted from you on the main chain. Bare in mind if you spend it on main chain before closing the channel, or your partner does, lightning will know and transactions will not go through, its a very complicated and smart process.
2) Yes, but coffee shop will be able to spend that BTC on lightning network, to for example buy supplies or more coffee beans.
3) You just need to get a lightning network enabled wallet like this one  set up cost is fees associated to your firs on-chain transaction to commit funds to the channel.
4) I think again here, just the fees on-main chain, but I'm not 100% sure. Miners will authorise every lightning transaction and settle it correctly on-chain (this is enabled by SegWit tech)
5) Some action you will need to perform in your wallet, I think they will have different user experience each.
6) Yep, you should only open this channel if you are planning to transact frequently with someone i.e. your petrol station / grocery store etc..
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:01:54
Not really, everything is validated against BTC chain via segwit and additional tech offered by lightning. Whole point is for it to become a layer two (think paper money for gold) and relief main chain.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:04:34
Investigate this further, It's a complex and very secure system.
 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:32:21
I think it works for now, but what was the blok limit 8mb? So 7 * 8, makes it 56 transactions per second, which is still far far away from visa. I think it only works well now, because it has no where close to BTC volume of transactions. Imagine how high they'll need to rise that block size to just get to visa lvls. This will make blockchain enormous in terms of memory it needs on a node, hence less full nodes, hence less secure / validated network. I don't think BCH is viable long term, but this is my personal opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:24:09
It can be adjusted, but hard fork would be required. You raised a good point though, I don't think it will happen until it is absolutely necessary. i.e. quantum computers become adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:20:11
For maps, maybe an explorer like this could help?  as for on-line transactions, there is this demo 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:58:10
Thats the goal, if you think about it to use your apple pay you first added your card, your card was connected to a bank that you opened, it likely receives money from your work etc.. with lightning it is as simple as receiving funds from your work into your lightning enabled wallet / node (phone), and opening 1 or 2 well connected payment channels. From here you are good to go into many places that have lightning support, they'll just show you a barcode that you can scan with your phone and make a payment.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:11:37
Lightning is a big network of "nodes" connected by payment channels, its small now as it is still work in progress, but if it gets adopted it will be really easy to use it, you become a node and say you connect to a coffee shop in your area, just 1 connection. Its likely that a lot of local folks will be connected to the coffee shop and these guys might have more connections to other things and so on. By opening payment channel with a coffee shop you also connect to all of its connections and connections of those connections and so on.
Example could be you wanting to buy some clothing from adidas shop, you get transaction hash and pay it from your lightning wallet. This transaction then goes through coffee shop, some guy who has connection to coffee shop and adidas shop. And bum, you just bought that clothing, just like swiping your visa card / scanning transaction hash barcode. There can be a lot of people in-between you and that adidas shop, but transactions are always almost instant and fee is super super small.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:21:25
But even if such suppernodes pop up, they have no controll over your funds, all they can do is not propogate it further which will mean that you don't use them anymore and they won't get the fee. But definetelly yes, having big and well conected nodes would make this much easier, i.e single open channel
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:51:41
:D you desperate noobs, look through my history I am pro Bitcoin and support core, this was legitimate question to ask for opinion of a person who might have faced similar situation. I'm holding majority of my BTC and hope I won't need to cash it out soon and instead spend it as is, however don't see anything bad in cashing out small parts of it for fiat now, which means sending it to my bank account and paying tax on it. Mention of UK where non taxable income is above 11k was useful, you two straight up attacked the thread, stop looking so savage, we will gain freedom from government offered by Bitcoin, but there is a lot of work ahead and 2 dorks trying to "protect their castle" won't help anyone, particularly new users coming here from old system who could very well have similar question and not be related to any FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:25:29
I kinda view this pre-fund no different to something like modern smart banks with pre-paid debit cards, or even your bank acc, i.e. its pre funded with money in the beginning of the month and you then spend it?
And yes you are right, once you commit funds to payment channel, it is verified on chain, you can than do 100's of transactions of chain which will all be settled one time on chain when you close the payment channel. For me personally this approach works very well, it allows me to budget, with 1 week in advance in mind, or even a month.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:31:44
It will still remain as BTC, it will have new consensus rules, hence the hard fork. But at that point everyone will likely agree with these to prevent quantum computing issues related to mining, hence old chain will die off (unless someone decides to mine on it etc...), Think of it like Ethereum or Monero hard forks, all of these upgrades are welcome, hence users adopt them, monero hard forks like every 6 months or something
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:10:41
It is on mainnet now, all you need is to download lightning compatible wallet like  and find a buddy ;) 
Edit: My bad, that wallet is not out yet, but I'm certain I saw another somewhere, or you can get source from GitHub
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:29:06
Anything that isn't limited will require you to do KYC (verify id), look at cryptopay, you can get card without verification, play with it and if you like it go through ID stuff to raise your limits.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:55:31
noup, and the more lightning is used, the less likely you'll need to set up payment new payment channels, transactions can be routed through a lot of different nodes and their payment channels. Think of this as that "connect the dots" game, as long as you can connect lines from yourself (connections are payment channels) to other node through the whole network, your payment will be successful. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:25:14
I assume withdrawal in this case means transfer of fiat to bank acc without me exchanging them in the middle?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:02:15
I'm fine with them adding BCH, but they don't allow to sell it in EUR and BTC ...
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:55:20
^ Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:53:08
One payment channel connecting to a node / merchant that has many open pyment channels will be enough most of the time, upfront cost, yeh, but it'll help you budget, if you run out, just top up
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:05:10
You own it, you can spend it within lightning network as soon as you get it, unless you want to put them into deep storage on bitcoin chain and not spend for ages, why close?
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:44:06
You always keep record of your spendings, if anything goes wrong you can always broadcast it to the chain and get funds you own. Of course this is cumbersome, luckily for you this will be automated by lightning nodes, they will keep track of leger for you, if anything goes wrong they close it etc etc.. incentive for them to do so are the fees, plus if someone gets your money and decides to close early and you don't, then network monitoring nodes can say that that claim was invalid and that malicious node looses their funds, you receive yours and I believe "good nodes" receive funds from malicious node. I wish I could go more in depth here, but I'm still learning about this as well. This is a good FAQ 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:02:12
You won't need to open new channels with new businesses, just one channel with a well connected node (which has connections and their connections etc...) will be enough for you to stand spending with a lot of different merchants.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:11:34
Initially yes, as this scales you can start spending funds elsewhere on lightning network. You can also view this as accumulating thing, where daily payments compose your monthly salary that you settle at the end of the month.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:00:44
For now, you are right, I was thinking about this as well. But as lightning becomes more usable it will reduce load on main chain, hence lowering the fees or at least you will be able to open a channel with low fee without waiting for days.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:39:30
Depends on how you look at it, right now for sure, only positive to this aspect that I can think of is you can sort of use this to budget your coffee purchases, although this is hard with current price volatility.
In future, you would commit certain amount of money to 1 big / well connected node and technically could spend that in several places, just from that 1 connection. In this case your lightning wallet basically becomes your "bank acc" in a way. But, this is in years to come, lightning will be great once widely adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:54:24
I see, this sounds similar to my situation, thanks I will look into capital gain related regulation in my country. ��
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:54:05
I'm afraid to answer this one as it gets super technical, best try google, but at its core it relies on Segregated Witness, lightning network ledgers that each party has, nodes that monitor main chain and penalise bad behaviour etc...
There is incentive for nodes to catch bad behaviour in terms of fees etc... and these is no incentive to cheat the system as you loose funds as a bad actor. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:33:58
I agree with you, we got segwit which increased block size limit, but not enough folks still adopted it. Temporary block size increase would be great for now and once layer 2 kicks off, I think we can revert it back to 1mb or even less.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:18:44
You can still transact within lightning network, i.e use received funds there in order to pay someone else on ln. I see your point however, for this to become a reality, ln needs to be very popular and well adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:34:16
Transactions are very fust, all demos I've seen with routed payments are sub 2s.
If someone pulls out closing hapens on main chain, at that point nothing you didn't expect or approve is deducted from you, bitcoin ledger is always correct.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:26:41
There won't be just 1 well connected node, naturally they will occur, 100's of nodes with 100,000's of connections, where big ones are connected to one another, so if you are connected to just one bigger one, lets say "nike store", you are connected to a lot of others.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:56:58
I'm not entirely sure about spending them on chain, but he can spend them 1) on coffee shop 2) if we assume coffee shop has connection to some sandwich supplier, bob will be able to buy those sandwiches as well, so will Alice. 3) bob can send money to alice and any other of her connections. Lightning is really good this way, when adopted well, you "hopefully" wouldn't need to open these payment channels often, you'd need a few like for your work, family maybe big shop in the area, rest of purchases could be easily routed through that big shop for example and everything will always settle correctly.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:47:26
It could, I think majority of big companies can allocate full salary if they want. Alternative to this is something like freelancer on daily payment contract who works 6 month job. Client can allocate full payment for the project and make daily lightning payments. You as a service provider know that they have funds to pay you, they know that they can easily pay you daily. Also, thinking in $ here is incorrect, as price is volatile, so no one can predict how much BTC they need to commit p/year
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:08:57
There is no transaction limit, no 10min wait, no mining, its instant and verifies against your initial on chain deposit + history of transactions you made on lightning network, it can to hundreds of thousands of transactions p/s, route them through a lot of nodes until optimal path is found for payment, there is so much to it than demonstrated in the video, for normal user they just need to know that this will become as easy as using your debit / credit card and bank acc, as soon as we see good adoption of this technology.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:55:34
So, best case scenario is that you already have an open channel, lets say with your work or wife, who have channel open with that coffee shop, or even if someone they know has it open.
You get hash from a coffee shop and make a payment, it will go through your wife, her friend and to the coffee shop, and you are done. If it fails, that means you need to open a channel, but than your wife's purchase in this coffee shop will go through you etc...
With time lightning network will relief main chain, hence fees will go down, but even if they don't you can open a channel with coffee shop once, specify low-medium fee, wait a bit and that is it. You also benefit from this, because that coffee shop is likely to be connected to many other people to whom you now don't need to connect. You have your lightning enabled wallet (lightning node of sorts) and can receive money in it from other payment channels and spend it on coffee if you wish as far as I'm aware, you'll also be likely to top up your lightning wallet buy purchasing bitcoin straight into it, instead of main chain, it will only go on main chain when you close related payment channel.

Cashing out 5 - 10% from monthly mining during ATH and storing rest, still resonates with holding the coin in my opinion. Question still stands. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:18:38
I think these will occur naturally, say if starbucks has a node, through it you are instantly connected to a lot of people and related services.

You don't lend it, you put it down as a collateral and get equivalent amount of USD (as example) into your bank account. You can then buy more BTC, invest it elsewhere etc... but depending on your contract you need to start re-paying this loan monthly over certain period of time, if you fail to repay part of your original deposit of BTC will be used as re-payment. When you re-pay full loan you get your BTC back.
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:38:15
Judging by the abstract:  no, you deposit 125% of your loan in crypto currency, where 25% is a buffer in case price goes down, as soon as crypto to loan ratio is lower than 1:1 SALT oracle (client that monitors loans) will issue maintenance notice asking you to do 1 of 3: Deposit more crypto to account for price change, pay more via fiat or do nothing in which case part of your deposit is taken to pay for this.
If price goes up however, some contracts will allow you to take part of your crypto deposit back early

I've got a question to ledger nano s owners, are you able to view your balance without ledger connected, just by opening the apps and will it update as well? i.e. do I only need to connect ledger when I need to send a transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:05:17
If this seems ridiculously over complicated, no wonder you can't comprehend what core is working on and that it takes time, but will result in a much more resilient and distributed network in the future.
BCH literary changed 1 variable from 1 to 2 within core's source, that doesn't sound like a solution that will work longterm, why? Well, try pinning up a full node, its getting harder and harder due to tech requirements / memory needed to run one and this is bad, as it slows down distribution of nodes across our globes, do the math here with what happens when you increase block size. This is why I don't trust in BCH its way to centralised for a decentralised currency, There is no innovation and I don't see it surviving long term.
I'm most definitely not trying to make any excuses here, I see roadmaps of both projects and Bitcoin is innovating and building something for the future, BCH just doesn't inspire me that way.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:54:42
Exactly, I wanted to understand where Bitcoin community stands on this and if it is on their roadmap to start working towards an upgrade that could secure it in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:32:50
If this wasn't just pure luck:
1) Introduce new currency that's super easy to sway miners on (difficulty adjustment) and to make (just increased block size). This also demonstrated "free money" nature of hard forks.
2) Start utilising their influence in crypto world to to portray it as bitcoin to uneducated people
3) Introduce another attack (SegWit2X) to take attention from BCH as a bigger threat, some here even drifted away from thinking that BCH is bad.
4) While SegWit2X was in the mist, bitcoin was going up due to people accumulating coins for the split, as they didn't want to miss out on what happened with BCH (free money)
5) With Bitcoin price up high, drop 2X, start selling some btc at ATH and investing it into BCH to pump it up (with their holdings they can easily afford it), people freak out and start exchanging BTC for BCH.
6) They knew miners will jump on this as well, clogging up BTC, so more uneducated people will freak out not knowing why their transactions are so expensive and take ages to verify (atm we have like 40% of hash power)
All in all, these guys planned this incredibly well to benefit both from BCH and BTC. What I think happens next is Bitcoin resolves scaling issues and them lot will dump BCH and transition back into BTC, just due to their greed / business instincts.

I think Litecoin is good, it was forked from Bitcoin, but it doesn't aim to compete with it, instead it wants to be used alongside BTC, which will be possible with Lightning network and atomic swaps. Its also cool, because they implemented things like SegWit and Lightning support first, kinda pre-resting / validating it before BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:13:50
Neither do I, they did a lot of good work to bring Bitcoin forward, but greed took over, however I don't think it's entirely their fault for "ruining people lives", its something each one of us needs to consider / account for when getting into crypto.

Was exploring full node feature myself, looks doable: 
For any sort of notifications however, these need to originate on a server that would be watching blockchain for mentions of your pub addresses, this means storing your addresses on the server, which is not ideal :/
Alternative would be to provide some complimentary server set up that you can run along your full node, or for app servers to connect to full node's of users, but this is extremely complicated for "normal users", but yeh, I will be exploring full node implementation

Glad you found content useful. I am set to break even on initial investment into cloud mining within 5 - 6 months (about 3 months left from this period given current prices), so I don't agree with you on profitability I'm afraid, hence the reason why I choose this method to monetise my posts. As for why they don't mine them selves, my call is diversifying? Say you invest into Dash mining hardware and suddenly it drops in price and is no longer profitable, you'll have all costs paid out to you to run it already from person who bought the mining contract, this is a risk you take as investor into cloud mining though, similarly to trading on exchanges.
