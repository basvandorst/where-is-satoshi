Oh no, they don't get off that easy. All law enforcement actors and agencies have autonomous discretion in what laws they choose to enforce. That's a fact.
You don't see police busting down doors for jaywalking or old sodomy laws. 
Jeff Sessions is old racist that at best is utterly uneducated in what exactly is harming society.
But yes, I do agree with you in that lawmakers don't get a pass either. Just understand that Jeff Sessions doesn't need to do this and he knows it.

When I travel overseas in dangerous places, I carry two wallets.  One is my throwaway if I get jacked.  I have enough cash to entice someone to take it but not enough to really take a dent out of me. 
Same with credit cards. I have a daily drain with a couple hundred, but no access to my main source in case I'm kidnapped to dragged to an atm. 
I don't know enough about bitcoin to be involved with it but seems to me that one of its main benefits is that you can  indeed have multiple digital wallets,  so use it.

@_date: 2014-08-03 14:24:58
What I mean is that you don't want to ask Coinbase to add features that help that process. They need plausible deniability at best, that they are not intentionally helping people to launder money through them. 
Like you said, they probably need to be able to report were it went once you request it out of your wallet, but im assuming thats the limit of their fiduciary duty and what you do with it afterwards, is on you.

@_date: 2014-08-03 17:36:58
Good point. Banks in particular are making a business out of fee generating. It's in the tens of billions of dollars a year. I don't see .60 for transacting adding up to $30 in overdrafts, throttled by holding back processing deposits and checks and allowing the issuing of payments when they know you don't have cash in the bank. They could all very well just not pay out until you do have the check in the bank, but that would of course affect their revenues. Obviously, this adversely affects the poorest of accounts, typically accounts that won't have the cash to sue the banks for gamifying your accounts.
I don't see anything close to that kind of nasty business going on anything related to bitcoin...yet.
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:56:06
What if you could sponsor someone as well? I'll share my .1 BTC with my friend who I know won't be called out as a spammer. 
Spammers would of course sponsor themselves, but least then they would be linked accounts so you could trouble shoot spammers in mass more effectively. 
That would also answer point in that you wouldn't need to ask Reddit's user base to hook up to social networks.

Well, training is a must, but it's not a determinant of how people react. Battled exposed troops will always perform better than fresh recruits out of training. They just know what to expect and they know how they'll react. There's something viscerally different about actually getting shot at that you can't ever truly model in a training scenario (although you can get close to it). And you can train someone to habitually respond to certain pressures, but you'll never know if it really worked for them until it happens.
Besides, I doubt these barely over minimum wage security guards in what's basically a second world country, are made to train consistently. It's South Africa, they got big problems there.

The question is, can we make bets with companies or even parts of companies (like this one particular franchise) without them needing to be part of this trading economy. I guess not, right? Because what's traded is a stock or equity of a particular company. They have to play the game too.
I just don't understand what happens once a company sells it's stocks to a public auction.. how does the trading of those stocks reflect what the company is doing once theyv'e sold those stocks to the public?

Plus,  we can't be sure search engines actually follow nofollow tags. However,  that does not discount any perceived pay to play arrangements publishers may be accepting.

Yeah. I know, I'm not a fan. But the problem is that they literrally had to give it to the banks. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one to think these banks where too big to fail. I think those SOBs executives deserve prison time for what they did to the U.S. However, when the centrals banks stopped lending to each other, that became a ticking time bomb. Huge Fortune 500 companies where months away from failing to make payroll. Huge consumer credit lenders where tapping down available credit once they realized the housing market was gone. Hundreds of thousands of people were being let go on a monthly basis. Never mind a run on the banks, how long before they were going to riot just to get food out Walmart?? That's what this incoming administration was facing in 2008 and that's what the feds had to wake up to, to deal with. You may not like what they did, most of the world doesn't really understand what they were facing... but they basically saved us all for going into the stone ages.

The biggest problem Bitcoin has is misinformed readers. No one was defrauded. There was a seller that initially agreed and then decided they didn't want to sell. The buyer wasn't defrauded. The seller wasn't defrauded. What's the problem here? That the writer of this article takes this story and make the leap that Bitcoin is a den of thieves because of his experience of ... not being defrauded? That's make no sense. It's like saying Visa and Mastercard fill entire stadiums of thieves because credit card fraud is live and well, despite what Visa and Mastercard does to prevent it (mostly by making the vendors pay for chargebacks). If you read this article again, it makes a great case of vendors to use bitcoin because at least with bitcoin, they're not forced to pay for chargebacks the way Visa and Mastarcard does. 
The biggest threat to Bitcoin is the lack of knowledge of how it works and institutional bad actors coming out to discredit the use of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2012-12-28 02:49:51
I don't know. But I can't imagine I'm the only one that has ever thought of this. But hey, happy that it sparked your interest too. It just hit when I was I reading everyone comments.
BTW, that link to Japan goes over my head but holy damn, what that guy is saying is pretty scary. Basically, Japan has become economically fucked due to their declining population. His anecdotal "real life" example is that they sold more adult diapers than baby diapers this year. In other words, their entire social security and pension system is unsustainable and the government has reached the point that they will never be able to pay back their loans. Ever. Period. Done. Japan on the path to bankruptcy if you believe this guy and his diaper story. 
They're going to *have to print money* to manage the inevitable decline which means there will be a lot of Japanese will be looking to protect the value of their Yen as that shit is going to drop like a stone and well be defacto method of sending many Japanese in the direction of Bitcoin. 
It's an interesting idea to kick around, but the only problem I see is that Bitcoin is fucking volatile as fuck! I mean it has serious price fluctuations compared to stable country coinage. For the Japanese to freak out about the value of their money *and then* consider Bitcoin as a hedge against the inevitable, doesn't totally jive for me.
The conditions would have to be that Bitcoin is more stable the the U.S. dollar and that would be tough! I mean, what's to keep these desperate Japanese from buying dollars really these days anyway? That I don't know but it seems a scenario where a Japanese dude that doesn't trust the value of greenbacks too much, got horrendously burned over his little pile Yen savings, and just heard about Bitcoin enough to think *fuck it, looks like Bitcoin is a better place to put my retirement than these greenbacks*...sounds like a stretch don't it?
@_date: 2012-11-04 05:22:10
I don't like it either, however, without some inflation, there is no motivation to invest. The problem with sticking your money in a saving's account is that you're basically are become the least risk adverse type of investor there is. The banks have to actually do something with your money because you won't or are unable to. Looking this economic climate right now as a good example of what low inflation causes.. there's trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines.. in 1% accounts, just killing time, because everyone is too afraid to make investments. So what do you when you have that? You artificially affect inflation.. that'll cause everyone to do something with their cash, because they know if that just sit on it (stuff it in their mattress) it'll literrally lose value over time.
It's a necessary evil is all I'm saying, a very useful one at that.
@_date: 2012-12-27 11:43:26

I totally agree. As it stands, it needs work. But it's a good first attempt.
@_date: 2012-12-28 21:27:16
You're absolutely right that we need to find this out. I don't know, and I would have to research this further, what the total cost of a transaction from the U.S. to Mexico is. I do business overseas to Romania and it costs us around $75 dollars per wire to send payments through the bank we do business...but I think that's high for most transactions. However, a guess (just for the sake of this comment) that it the average falls anywhere between $10 to $75? 
Assuming we get that average cost figured out (which shouldn't be hard to find out) the next question is how much does it cost to get Bitcoins and get them out in Mexico is the next question? That's probably a more complicated question.
The other thing to consider is that price alone may not be the only "feature" of interest for these people. A lot of these folks don't have bank accounts and they are storing cash in sketchy places. Perhaps there is angle there that can differentiate Bitcoin from the Western Unions of the world in that no one uses Wester Union to store cash too, right?
You're point is very valid as well as I think there's still enough meat on this bone to pick on.
@_date: 2012-11-04 19:51:54




I stand corrected. It's based on time and at a rate that equivalent to the average supply commodities that is found... according to [Bitcoin's wiki] (
That creates a controlled level of inflation...which I give you is arguably much more desirable than a bunch of guys sitting around at the Fed.

Read your employment contracts. You could be breaking your own employment agreement by merely working on something else outside of the office. That being said, what you do on your own time should be your business in my opinion. But what you do on the company dime, with company equipment, is not yours and would be considered stealing if you're doing work that is for the company's benefit. They're paying you to help the company, not to help yourself to company resources right?

Oh, cool. Well that's great. You made money on your investment in Bitcoin, but the price of Bitcoin is not dictated to stay there or continue to increase. 
Rather, the price of bitcoin is really driven by the popularity of Bitcoin,  (more new buyers, increases the demand to buy bitcoin, which increases the price sellers are able to sell bitcoin) but keep in mind that bitcoin is built in with a mechanism to manage inflation. 
That is, Bitcoin effectively "steals" value much the same way the Feds does by ever increasing the money supply (with ever increasing difficulty for miners to get bitcoin). So the more popular bitcoin gets, the more miners are added to the economy, the more bitcoin are put into circulation, the harder it becomes to calculate (find) bitcoins.
Alternatively, if there was no mechanism for that, say the number of bitcoins that everyone was able to trade with was a set number...then there would eventually lead to hyper inflation on the price of bitcoin (they become more valuable the more people want them).
The only key difference between what bitcoin does and what the Feds do,  is that the Feds are just a bunch of old white guys sitting around table, while Bitcoin is mathematical algorithm, affecting the money supply.  
They both MUST create/manage inflation..the difference is whether you trust math to do this vs some old guys in a building somewhere in Washington DC. 
I'm with the algorithm side of things, but keep in mind, that doesn't mean the Feds didn't do the right thing in 2008. They were literrally forced to (by the market collapse) by the decades of incompetence before that.
Medicine never tastes good but if we valued preventative care, 2008 should have never happened. What happened AFTER 2008 is all based on efforts to save the world for complete financial collapse. 
if they hadn't done what they did, we would have been rioting in the streets for food.. mad max style... and we came pretty close to it.

Good point on the Open Source. Open Source by itself doesn't sell anything to the uneducated about it, so dont' start there. 
A good "thinking" exercise is to write down "personas" of typical audience members you want to target. Let's go with Mexican immigrants for the example I used in a previous comment. Then write next to it motivations they would have (whether they know it or not) for using Bitcoin...and THEN write messaging that serves that on a sweet platter...prioritize the most reachable audiences and pick the best message you have and go with that.

It's a good start for sure, but I think it's valid to consider that this is just too good to sound true... so, better yet, find the most basic, innocuous aspect of what's decently good about Bitcoin and use THAT to lure them into discovery.

"Wouldn't it be great if you could just send money to anywhere in the world, without any fees? Now you can." 
Even this is a bit "schemish" I think, although, hey, you could translate this bitch into Spanish, and pass it around their communities where they have an intrinsic need to find better alternatives to douchebag Western Union, that's have been ripping them off every time they want to send money to abuelita in Mexico.

It's mind boggling [huge, Wikipedia says:](

* transactions exceeded 41 million in 2003
This [LA Times story]( is talking about how and why remittances where down by 20% for month of September...*but damn:*
* 2011 was $22.7 billion
* 2012 amount to about $17.2 billion
They're playing with more than a billion a month? Wow. I was too lazy to find a solid source but assuming the National Business Review knows wtf they're talking about, [here's a recent article on Bitcoin]( and at the very bottom it states:
"This year alone there have been some five million Bitcoin transactions, double what there were in 2011."
This the numbers of monetary transactions going from the U.S. to Mexico alone which is roughly doing 800% larger than Bitcoin, currently. If you were able to eventually capture even 1% of that market, that's $200 million dollars put into the system annually. And, *that's just to Mexico, son.*

Yes, I do know, and that's a VERY interesting part of Bitcoin. But who's going to pay transaction fees of a few cents to store thousands of docs for kicks, that somehow bumps up the daily transactions every, single month for the past couple of years? Someone hook up their dropbox in some wonky way to Bitcoin? I don't know. That seems like a stretch. I mean doing things for kicks is one thing, but there's no real gain from it, so that's not going attract a lot of activity, especially when it costs something...albeit, not a whole lot.


Who would benefit form artificially increasing the transaction volume? Maybe Bitcoin startup trying to close a round of investment and they're using this one metric to make that happen! Doubt that. 


Ok, so how does that pump the price though? A large volume could indicate a large sell off, just as easily. 


That could be a factor, no doubt about that. But if that was a large factor, wouldn't there be a massive dip in trans volume when Silk Road and Silk Road 2.0 closed for a while their after?
Silk Road closed in Oct 2013 and Silk Road 2 was shut down Nov 6, 2014, right? I don't know how or have the patience to figure out the "intrinsic value" transaction volume around those months, but you can eyeball it at [Coinbase chart]( and it's like it didn't miss a beat. Oct 2013 was over 50k a day, Nov 2014 around 70k, and now flirting in 90k a day or so (skipping weekends).
Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting it is or isn't being artificially increased (I don't know), but if there is something, it's not this stuff. And if there is...I want to know why.
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:34:18
Yeah, that explains his response. He's got fair enough points though. Whatever the volume of cash passing through the system, if the number of transactions continues to increase, that's a good sign to me that trust is being built over time. It means people are doing more with, regardless of the cash volume. That'll come later.
@_date: 2015-03-22 05:54:51

What in a thousand years from now? This sounds like an unlikely scenario.
@_date: 2015-03-22 01:32:57
Point taken. I suppose I should make a distinction that when I mean speculation, I mean the price speculation phase, when we hit $1000 a bitcoin not so long ago.
But I should also say that this isn't even the first pricing bubble "Bitcoin" popped, right? There's been more than a few, like in 2011 when it peaked at $32 and crashed down to $2.  There were several crashes of price declines of 30 or 60%? In each of those crashes, people called for the end, and a couple of years later, and that those crashes look like hiccups that are hardly relevant now.
There's no question that everything about Bitcoin should be considered speculative at this point, but that just begs the question, when will it not be? 
@_date: 2016-10-02 11:57:14
Yes. Because this nonsense hardly deserves further effort. Your too gone, you're not changing your mind, and it's incredibly insulting.
@_date: 2015-03-22 01:38:01
Sure, any chart will show you the number of transactions. Look at this [Coinbase chart this across the last year.](
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:27:47
So I'm looking at [transactions per day.]( and I'm not too focused on the volume of dollars passing through the system. If I where look at that, you're totally right. Paypal just dwarfs Bitcoin, never mind MasterCard and Visa. Yes, for the most part, seems to be the same amount of cash sloshing around in Bitcoin.
OK, so why are bitcoin transactions increasing but it's money supply seems fairly static with a few wild spikes in the past?  I think it's because Bitcoins infrastructure is still not perceived to be trustworthy by people, even with minimal understanding about what it does. Sure, if people did their homework, they would be impressed by how it's been designed, the possibilities of what you could do with it, but that's if they even come to understand at all. 
Fortunately, people don't have to intimately understand something to trust it enough to put their hard earned shekels into it. Most people have no idea how ATMs work, but they're everywhere, it consistently takes or spits out your money, and most people you know use it. Bitcoin isn't quite there. Most people you know, don't use it. 
The increasing number of daily transactions, to me, indicates that people are doing something with it that's useful to them and it continues become more useful nearly every week.
Whether it's trying to day trade it (why?) or just being some Overstock.com, accepting payments from customers for crap and then quickly dumping them for cash, at least they're at using it. Oh sure, the occasional big shot institutional investor that buys up million dollars worth of Bitcoin is nice a vote of confidence but mainstream media seems to be kind of over Bitcoin. They couldn't easily explain it. And yet, there's real money from SV going into Bitcoin related startups. They need 10x returns in a few years and this is one of the better bets in quite a while. Other than Uber (which is a real service), what else is there out there that has excited tech investment? 
Meerkat? That along should speaks volumes about the attention span of the mainstream media, or the power of good marketing.   
My point is that all of that is irrelevant to me. If the number of transactions has risen but the total amount transferred has remained static, wouldn't that mean there's more people pushing cash around, perhaps in smaller amounts, while they grow confidence in this system, that it does what it professes to do? 
That's a really good signal to me. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:36:34
Alright, so why would someone find it useful to send thousands of transactions for a couple of dollars? If there's a market incentive to do that, it would have been done by now and I'll say, ok, you're totally right,  seems like that's an artificial number that is meaningless because it's been abused. But seems like there's a market incentive not to do that, right? Transaction fees, no?
I'm not an expert, obviously.
