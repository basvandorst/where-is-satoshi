Not exactly a question, but sort of. Look at the LTC and BTC charts for the last few hours and tell me why they completely parallel each other?
It happens most of the time, BUT on occasion, they will completely do the opposite and when BTC is going up, LTC is going down, when BTC is going down, LTC is going up. I'm not going to post screenshots, but it's suspicious as hell.

Yeah, this is almost as bad as chicks saying chocolate is better...

What if the government created reality and we live in a computer simulation and you are and always have been tracked and observed for gaming/theater/gambling/experimentation purposes?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:38:11
Hm, I guess it's just a typical day to see some dude selling over 22 million in coin in one sitting.

What holds value? Anything the people trading that thing, digital or otherwise, deems gives it value. Please GTFO. No one needs you to get involved.
(and FYI, there is a limit to the total bitcoin that will be in "circulation".)

I feel like this post is a clue into the fact that a secret club of whales exists and manipulates the market (notice the big red dildos like minutes ago, dropping BTC over 700 points like nothing, in just 2 minutes). I would assume with the proper brains in place, they could all decide when and how to do what they do without consequence/being figured out.

That's not what you said. You said a 10% increase was better than sex (maybe you said that, maybe you didn't). If that = a million dollars, than of course it's better than one sex. But is it better than 50 sex? Or even 30 sex?

Nonsense. The thread was deleted and then brought back later. It didn't exist via bookmark for hours.

Does withdrawing USD to bank account on GDAX cost the same in fees as doing the same on Coinbase? I know limit trades eliminate the fees on buying/selling BTC (on GDAX vs CB), but I'm looking for the cheapest way to put money back into my account.

What the hell is the deal with this 450 BTC sell wall? I'd love to know how that even happens and who is behind it. So much manipulation going on.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:24:51
I'm only 12 and even I know "$20" means $2000.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:12:16
I know this may be a dumb question, but why am I unable to move the chart to see previous days on the GDAX price chart without changing the increment? For instance, I have it set to 1 hour increments and it only goes back a couple days and I am unable to grab the chart and slide it to see further back at the same interval, like virtually all of the other exchange site's charts do. Is there a proper way to do this?

I think a lot of "experts" are saying it will drop big time because they are trying to FUD a big selloff before Sunday so they can get in at a lower price than it is right now.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:52:52
Fairly sure it's fully insured (from other comments I've seen here).
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:43:39
It's probably Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:48:33
Maybe someone can explain why it disappeared for hours last night suddenly.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:08:49
I'll send you an email any time I sell (because that's when it goes up, right after) and any time I buy (because that's when it goes down, right after). Just use those and you're bound to lambo soon.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:12:06
Out of curiosity, where would I look to see what you're referring to?

FAKE NEWS.

Do a bank transfer if you want to buy and trade same day. It's the only way on Coinbase other than using a CC.

I like to imagine that 90% of commenters here are afraid of being hacked so instead of saying they made $10,000 today, they say "$100". This place is a bunch of vagrants and underlings (cough cough, kings and Gs)

will be back at 15k overnight and that's when I'll buy more coin.

I realize the "Daily Discussion" threads have been inundated with questions from new users, but is this "mentor" thread supposed to replace the Daily Discussion thread for the day?

No one knows if it's one whale. It may be an exchange for all we know. Or some major corporate player who owns a shitload who is purposely manipulating the market for some purpose (futures possibly).
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:01:21
There is absolutely a correlation. Look at the litecoin chart over last couple hours. It virtually parallels the BTC chart.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:26:10
What happened during the middle of the night with the giant sell wall was very disconcerting and don't let anyone try to make it seem like it was just some normal occurrence. Same with the 300% litecoin gain a day before that. SERIOUSLY secret shit going on the last couple of days.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:10:09
That's not what I asked, but thanks (for when I do that).
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:15:47
What do you click on to see that? Sorry to be a newbie pain in the ass, but I would love to know how to see stuff like this on GDAX, which I just began using.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:12:35
I don't agree with this. I believe whales were manipulating the market in ways we can't understand with litecoin and etherium since the futures shit hit.
