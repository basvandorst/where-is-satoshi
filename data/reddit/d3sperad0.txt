Initially there would be major problems getting a decentralized network/internet off the ground, because if your neighbours, or a person with some bucks to get a strong WiFi router going to cover a block or two, isn't in your area you will be out of lick. However, if this idea (or another form of meshnet) takes off then here would be little problem connecting to the network sans ISPs. As an example of strong WiFi signals just look at what some cities and ISPs are doing with offering free WiFi thought their downtown cores and beyond. Locally shaw cable systems has some amazing WiFi coverage. I can go almost anywhere in my city and get WiFi through my ISP, but if this were a decentralized meshnet I could forgo the ISP and just use that to get my content.

Even the 60 dollar router on that list can handle a max thouroughput of about 60Megs/s and there are routers at the 100 dollar range that are capable of over 1000 megs per second, so I'm not sure what the issue is concerning bandwidth. The more people operating on the network the more routers/nodes the system will have available to route traffic through, so as new users switch to the network (assuming that happens) the more bandwidth will become available. I have a 50mbps connection coming to my house through cable and I've never even come close to maxing that out. Even with the fastest DL speed I've ever seen coming through from steam I hit 4... I can't see how bandwidth will be an issue. That's not to say it couldn't be, I just see ample bandwidth available even through a home router.
@_date: 2014-01-16 19:41:23
It would be transferring information between routers. I'm not sure why you are confused where the bandwidth would come from. The meshnet/bitcloud would be a decentralized internet. No ISPs involved. All traffic would be between peers/nodes which would be comprised of individual routers. Most bandwidth would be constrained only by the slowest router in the network, much like it is now. If you do a traceroute to your intended service you will see that your internet traffic is routered through many switches along the way and it's the one with the highest latency that impacts your DL/ul speeds/latency. So bandwidth will be limited only by the weakest link along the best possible route for the traffic to travel.  
Likely (depending on how close your neighbours are) when you pull up the available internet connections on your comp you'll see your neighbours WiFi/routers. If this were to happen then those people interested in making this happen would install the appropriate firmware on their router (something like cjdns I'm assuming) and you would then created a meshnet between the routers which would enable you to access bitcloud and all the info on the network, be it websites, media like YouTube and the like. Again, bandwidth would be constrained by the number of people connected to the network and how many nodes (routers) are nearby and what quality they are. However, it sounds lime the system would be dynamic and be constantly looking for the best connections kinda like dling a torrent.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:31:32
If this were to take off, yes, eventually there would be. The hard part is getting enough folks on board to make it happen and there are significant technical hurdles to make that happen, but the concept seems sound. The biggest difficulty I can see is integrating this system with existing router hardware/firmware. Most folks would never be able to flash new firmware onto their routers (eg cjdns) and an app for phones and tablets, while making it easy for non technical folks to run a node, is not going to be enough to create a full blown meshnet. So, no, in the immediate future it's a pipe dream, but it's an interesting idea and I'm glad there are people working on it.
@_date: 2014-05-06 07:02:05
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:16:11
Yes, but not everyone will be connecting through the same set of nodes. If a route that was the lowest latency and highest bandwidth becomes saturated then the system will start routing traffic along the new fastest route. 
Edit: [here's] ( a a list of home routers and their total thourouhput. As you can see, many affordable routers can do above 1000 MPs so bandwidth shouldn't be Mich of an issue with enough nodes to create a network. The problem is getting enough nodes to make a network that covers a large enough geographical location. And that's a major hurdle to overcome and it sounds like part of the hope in making it happen is the monetization of providing bandwidth to the network, which would incentivize entrepreneurs to invest in connecting the various networks across the large distances an average router can't cover.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:01:05
Your home router will provide the bandwidth. People will connect router--router--router--wifi hotspot--phone/tablet/laptop running the bitcloud app--router--bitcloud app--wifi hot spot--bitcloud app--router and so on. The bandwidth will only be constrained by the weakest link in the chain and once there are enough available nodes the software/firmware will try and always find you the fastest route (much like what happens today through your ISP).

This is the kinda shit people who have no clue of how labour was treated before unions think. They've hooked the koolaid IV right to a main artery and that's that. Unions are bad mmmkay!

They are not, however, planning on plunging one into the ocean. You would set up a robotic network of refueling stations (fuel would be made on location in the belt), mining robots/satellites, and return cargo ships, which would drop off at earth and return. Once you had the infrastructure in place it would be a near constant flow of raw materials.

Hey, if you're a Dev perhaps I can grab your attention for a quick sec. Love the game, play it a ton with my wife, however, I just got the Samsung galaxy mega (6.3in phablet) and I can no longer see the score of the games I'm playing. The ui doesn't seem to be able to render properly. Not sure if it's the screen size or what, but it'd be great if there was better support for the large screen phablets (if that is the problem). I've tried reinstalling and wiping cahche and all that fun stuff... Any thoughts?

when TPB released the tor browser I decided to finally look a bit further into it and found myself at the [tor project's site]( for this project called vidalia. I read a bit about it there and it sounded like it would be pretty easy and I followed the links to the [download]( of the vidalia software which comes in multiple configurations. One of the configurations comes preset to function as a non-exit node, so I grabbed that one, installed it and voila. Seems to work. It says I'm connected to the tor network and all that fun stuff.

People don't take Bitcoin seriously because they have trust issues? What are you trying to say?
@_date: 2013-03-15 05:31:49
Indeed... However my point is that those mechanisms are not inherent to fiat currency and are not part of it's definition and bitcoin is a fiat currency that lacks many of those mechanisms.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:16:52
While that may be true I still don't understand your original comment. How does this guys belief that the signs will be worth lots in the future have any bearing on whether or not people take Bitcoin seriously?

Interesting. I didn't realize putting money into a checking or savings account was the equivalent of loaning you're money. I knew that the money is used by banks to make profit and they give you a small percent back in the form of interest, but I didn't know you loose ownership of the money. As a side though, if you loan your money to a bank aren't they then obligated to pay back their depositors with whatever they can raise through bankruptcy (selling existing assets and the like). It seems backwards that the entity that lost the loaned money can take more money from deposits to pay other obligations...

lol, that would be interesting. I bet it varies depending where you are. still, as you can see what happened with the [sabre engine]( (and other tech that's ahead of it's 'time') they don't like it when technology more advanced than their conventional stuff gets into the hands of private individuals.

It's not the same thing. The money that is in the bailout fund came from taxes, but it's no longer an individuals assets. They are taking peoples property and using it to pay off the banks obligations. The money they are taking has already been taxed and a small fraction of that, along with other EU countries taxes goes into the EUs bailout fund (can't remember the name of it). This money is what should be used along with whatever remaining assets the bank holds (plus what the Cypriot government can raise without resorting to the current scheme). This is my understanding... I'm unclear why someone's personal assets can be confiscated in this manner and it not be considered theft.
