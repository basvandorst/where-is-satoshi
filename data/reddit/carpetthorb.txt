I think you may be misinterpreting what halving is? LTC halving is AUG 5th watch that on Robinhood to get an idea of what will happen, maybe nothing will happen though price could already be factored in.
 usually it’s a price increase because miners get paid half of what a block usually pays hence the price increase to sustain the miners.

your words are irrelevant and meaningless. One day you will rise and see just how truly pitiful your efforts are. You will rise at 5 pm and stare into the setting sun and ask yourself why you even bothered to attempt to challenge my superior intellect. You have no idea what I am capable of. You have seen only an inkling of my power. Never in 4.6 billion years of existence has the planet ever seen such a meaningless and unequally matched confrontation. Why do you even try. This is the equivalent of Leonidas looking over his 300 soldiers and looking up and seeing a thermonuclear warhead falling from the sky. Those 300 soldiers are you, and that bomb is my sheer superiority that towers over you and will eventually consume you in a fiery maelstrom of facts, evidence, intellect, charm, charisma, and prowess. You will truly experience the meaning of utter defeat by the time I am done with you and your pathetic attempt at resistance. Your kneecaps stand no chance. Why do you even bother.

you can’t deny the fact that I'm an Alpha male...
And girls want to fuck alpha males. Let it piss you off as much as you want, but you know it's completely true. That girl you like who is kinda cute in a weird way, but is totally sweet and you have the biggest crush on? The one who keeps going back to guys who treat her wrong for reasons you don't understand? The one who calls you up at 1 am to cry about how her boyfriend hasn't called her in 3 days, and no matter how long you listen to her, she'll never think of you as anything other than asexual? The one who will curl up next to you on the couch, hug you close, kiss you on the cheek, and never let you fucking touch her beyond that?
Yeah, I'm fucking her.
The hot girl who won't even look at you when you nod at them and smile? The one who laughs when you trip in the hallway and drop your stuff? The one who comes up and coyly aks for your help with her homework, and then pretends you don't exist once you finish?
Yeah, I'm fucking her too, even harder.
The geeky girl you think might be enough like you that you have a chance with her? She plays Warcraft on your server, and watches anime, and reads comics? She's so incredible and you just love her so much but you still haven't worked up the courage to tell her how you feel about her?
Guess who just sucked me off and told me they'll always love me?
And what's more? I laugh at guys like you. When you cry about how much girls treat you bad, and wonder why they can't just see that you're a nice guy who would always treat them right? I nod and tell you to hang in there, you'll find someone right for you someday, don't give up hope man. But inside? I'm laughing my ass off at you you pathetic fuck. Every girl you set your sights on, who isn't a disgusting pig-monster, I'm going to fuck 6 ways from Sunday before you even tell her you think she's cute. I won't bother trying when you finally settle for that 350 pound girl who works at Hardees, you can have that. Anything else I'm going to cum on her face before you get those lips near it. And the biggest reason I laugh? It's not me doing all this. It's the girls. When you cry about how lonely you are? Or talk about how you just want to curl up and disappear, and all that emo bullshit? You're triggering her "Don't Fuck" instinct something fierce. You're a miserable weak coward, why would she want your genes? Feel free to buy her a new computer and help her decorate her apartment, you're great for that. But her baby-maker is barking orders at her, telling her to wrap her legs around me and hold on for as long as she can. She needs it, on a primal level you'll never get to see first hand, even if you do get a chance to fuck her. Sooner or later one of them will lay back and spread their legs, but you won't see any hunger in their eyes. They won't beg you to love them forever and make them yours. You won't know what it's like to see her animal side needing you as much as she needs to eat and breath.
And she's cheating on you, I promise that. When she sits around quiet and uncomfortable, acting irritable and irrational towards you, wanting you to just back away and leave her alone, it's not her period. It's because I haven't called her for a day or two and her instincts are telling her to go find me. The primitive section of her brain doesn't want to risk smelling like another man when she gives herself to me, she wants me to know she's completely mine. We do things together she tells you she never would. Her pooper? Mine. I want to give her a facial? of course. I want her to suck the cum out of my dick, even though I just finished pumping away at her ass? she's never going to tell me no. She doesn't WANT to tell me no. She wants me to know she'll do anything it takes to keep me. She'll rim my ass while she's down there sucking me off if it means pleasing me. She'll drink my cum from a shotglass. She'll wear a buttplug when we go out to dinner. She'll sleep handcuffed to my headboard. Anything.
And then she'll go home to you and tell you she's not in the mood today.
I'd say you should become an hero, but you being around makes her want a real man all the more, so keep fagging it up emo bitches, I'll keep that pussy warm while you're crying in the corner.

Eating cereal with water is better than with milk
I am a true believer that cereal with water is better. The taste of milk conflicts with the taste of the cereal, whereas water does not. While still getting the same texture, water does not ruin the taste of cereal. My friends crucified me when I told them this...so for this reason I am coming here in search of others who share my beliefs of water being better than milk. I pour the cereal before the water, for those asking

I just downvoted your comment.
What does this mean?
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
Why did you do this?
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
•	⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors, •	⁠Spreading incorrect information, •	⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.
Am I banned from the Reddit?
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
@_date: 2019-10-26 23:15:10
You can use BTC as a store of value against traditional Government backed currency’s, also if you need to travel and don’t want to deal with converting currency or risk getting your money taken by airport security you can just spend your BTC on foreign currency at an ATM or spend it somewhere that accepts it. Bitcoin gives you the ability to really control your Money.

You need a transmitters license through the fed if you are sending BTC freshly acquired from a 3rd party, but with no 3rd party involved you’d still probably have to comply with local state laws, what is your motive for this?  If you’re just selling to sell it’s more simple than you think.

Bitcoin is blowing up for a reason many of us have waited years for this, patience is the only thing you need to succeed, you will always see the market retract and expand but there’s a bigger picture in the future. You should not regret selling because if you try to time the market you will eventually lose your footing, you have to put in your investment and actually let it mature, sure you could try to sell and buy back cheaper but what happens when it goes up afterward you’ll be super fucking upset and it’s not worth feeling like that.

Bitcoin is a combination of tech that we’ve had since the 80’s and up. Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta were trying to find a way to make secure time stamped documents in the 90s and used merkle trees which improved efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block. 
They didn’t think about the use case blockchains had back then and it wouldn’t be until Satoshi that the first blockchain currency was introduced in 2009 shortly after that bitcoin could have been used for payments.

You need to send it to an external exchange and trade it for BTC then back to Coinbase. If you withdraw BTC the fee will probably be ridiculous so withdraw it in OX or USDC because the fees for exchange withdraw would be much lower. Then sell your 0X or USDT for USD then buy BTC with USDT or 0X.
Edit: just checked Kucoin and the 0X withdraw fee is 2  0X  so about .66 USD. Fee for USDT is 1.00 so 0X is your best bet!

@_date: 2019-09-03 16:54:34
The problem is when they wonder how you have a 600k house or a 300k car with no job. You can’t explain that income, and when they catch you you’ve already been complicit in tax evasion which is a felony also, if I was you I would have either paid them or moved to a tax free country to sell. 
With that aside how do you get fiat from your BTC?
@_date: 2019-09-14 22:13:04
Another point is no one cares if they ban the currency if someone wants to use it they will use it.  They could ban BTC but how would they enforce this?

 I use Non KYC exchanges all the time and they have plenty of volume, yet I still don’t see your point? Op asked a question that makes no sense. anyone in any country can access plenty of exchanges with ample volume, the people over paying for BTC are just getting cucked because lack of care or options to purchase BTC with in the first place. 
I can agree with you on DEX volume however, but these DEX’s will take time to pick up adoption because the fees associated with on chain transacting compared to server sided trading.

I know that but if you use a lower market cap coin your chance for higher profit increases, btc will not 2x easy whereas neo could for example. i remember trying to arbitrate Bitcoin diamond when I saw it was $47 on Kucoin and $2.00 on gate.io but then when I got to depositing the coins I found out they were disabled ��

That's when i shapeshift to monero and send it to a new address before selling it on local Bitcoin.

Coinbase lets you get any amount.

That's why my exchange is over seas ;)
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:33:18
Only trade with someone that has good reputation.  And if your selling bitcoin don't use paypal.

How would them destroying bitcoins immutability benefit them? It’s like burning a field of crops and still expecting to eat.
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:01:07
The problem is we don’t know how much money is being spent, they can spend $100 on a “screw” if they needed just don’t go over budget and dig in our pockets.

Why would anyone move back to fiat? Value is completely diluted and will only get worse, clearly the FUD is just making everyone buy back BTC not USD. 
Also a bit odd that this issue is your first post.

Still a concern your private key had to be used to do that someone opened your wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:13:57
Why would you do that? How much was the transaction worth?
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:40:07
Ontology has already done this.

Something with a 500k market cap has more room to grow as opposed to something with a 200b market cap. Some projects have market caps of 500k meaning if it went to 100m you’d be very rich, if your ok with smaller gains then that’s fine but most projects are still down around 95% compared to BTC being down 60%
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:26:39
You should get an older decent computer specifically for your BTC if it’s worth enough to you. I try to keep everything I have offline.

Why would you even post this, do you know how cringe you are?
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:54:54
If you bought BTC any time before now you’d have also been losing money the same way, further in time it won’t matter if you bought at 3k or 6k the point is you bought when other speculators didn’t.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:09:46
Try again if you still have the balance. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:11:39
Could be a hackers test transaction move all your  BTC to a different wallet. And .025 is $175 dollars right now how are you not concerned that’s not normal
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:29:05
Only if you bought in at a ridiculous rate in the first place.

P2P is risky unless you know the seller, not many people want to get scammed.

I just told you what happened your wallet is compromised, and if you don’t move it now it will be gone and I won’t feel bad for you, move it or who ever has your private key will.

Golds biggest use case is in electronics, that’s the only legitimate valuation that gold has besides pure speculation, and BTC CPU mining is still done, however it’s extremely ineffective.

I’m hoping for mid 1000s 
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:15:10
Try buying smaller cap Coins/tokens you can actually make pretty good returns from those. You won’t profit much off bitcoin unless your putting in 10k+ at this point. For 1000 you could get 1/8 a BTC but you could get 100 NEO or 800 NANO for the same price which would net you better returns in the short term/long term. I’m not saying buy those they are just an example.
@_date: 2019-05-29 18:17:37
How could you lose money if it has only gone up?
Edit: I miss interpreted your post, don’t take the last of your money and put it into another risky investment just save if you can’t afford to lose anything.

That’s the exact definition of a coincidence but where do you see the market going as of late though? 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:33:05
Be prepared to lose about 2/3s of your investment in the coming months. 
Also I highly doubt you bought 30k in BTC and posted it on reddit, if you wanna be smart about it sell 25k and keep putting in 2.5k increments.

Until a Astroid of pure fucking gold smashes into the ocean near Somalia and those sick bastards dilute the price so much that the average man can spank off with a gram or two of gold powder mixed with mineral oil daily, gold will then be valued by its ability to reduce nut funk
