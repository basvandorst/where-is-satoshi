OK, so I was looking at the graph a bit of the last year, mostly over this current year, 2018.
There is a graph thingie called a pennant.  And its like short to medium term stuff.  And its shape is updownupdown, but with each one being a smaller travel.  And after the tops of the graphs and the bottoms of the graphs intersect - then the previous motion resumes.  This would be the upwards stuff leading into late last years big up thingy.
If you check on the graph of the last 12 months and start the pennant at the all time high and then take the highs and lows and draw lines on them bad guys...   you get an intersection - the end of the pennant.
Right about now.
And if this was a big old pennant, we should be at the start of a nice long upwards thingy.
The only question - and I have been waiting months for this to finish is whether we have one more up and down, over the next say 2-3 weeks, or if we have had the last up and down as the size of it is small now.
Just saying this might be the start of a long long upward thingy.
