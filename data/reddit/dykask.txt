Except that the world will see and know what is going on before long.  Self correcting problem.

You math is right buy your understanding is wrong.  
1) You can sell back the GHS you buy at any time.   However to give you credit while I've been mining I've seen the price drop by almost 50%.  It has bounced back a bit, but that is a concern.
2) You can trade between BTC &amp; GHS, I use a bot I wrote.   You can also trade between some other pairs, (BTC &amp; NMC), (NMC &amp; GHS) and (BTC &amp; LTC).  
3) You get some NMC from merged mining and a couple of other questionable coins.  
4) Lately we have been getting 70+ blocks a day.   
Currently I'm .07 BTC lower than I started.   A couple weeks ago it was more like 0.3 BTC lower than I started.   Anyway, I'm pretty sure that the combination of my bot and mining will get me to profit.

Right now I'm .07 BTC below where I started.   I'm way up if you look at dollars the BTC are worth, but for mining that shouldn't count.   I think it is a pretty safe bet if I just leave everything alone, I be profitable soon in terms of bitcoin. (BTC) 
While I've been mining the price of GHS (gigahash/s) has dropped from almost .07 BTC/GHS to a low of .036 BTC/GHS, right now it is around .044 BTC/GHS.  For some reason they quote the prices a GHS/BTC, not sure what the logic is for that.

No, double spending isn't good, it is stealing.   However, I do agree that anyone that does it will probably get caught.   So maybe you are correct as it will help remove some thieves from society.

Why I won't stop mining at CEX.io, at least right now. 
1) Being under 51% doesn't prevent double spending.  This 51% level is just something for simple minds to latch on to.
2) If Ghash.io or any other pool try to control the blockchain, they will get caught.  There is always legal avenues if people are willing to pay for them.
3) Making pools harder to use (like P2P) isn't a good solution.  So far every pool I've tried is really awful and difficult to use.  There are also plenty of problems with CEX.io/Ghash.io too.
4) Contracts for mining are common but CEX.io offers real market and is really easy to use, plus they have a simple API that lets me do what I want.   The website barely runs, but it gives me what I want. 
5) The real threat to bitcoin isn't double spending which would just be a crime.  The real threat are the bitcoin users that want to use bitcoin to avoid taxes and use bitcoin for illegal uses like online gambling where it isn't allowed.  Those are the people that we should be shouting down.   They are the ones that will cause governments to get involved.   
6) If Ghash.io is evil, that probably every other pool is too, even P2P.   Pools are run by people, evil people are everywhere.  
7) I live in Tokyo and power prices here are insane.  CEX.io gives me a cheap way to mine and play with trading bots I'm writing.   If end up making money, I'll declare my income when I spend my bitcoins and I'll pay my taxes.   I want bitcoin to succeed.

Now I'm sitting at a small gain.  Last night I used the bitcoinwisdom calculator and found that it was off by a large amount on the current earnings.   I adjusted the constant from 600 to 750 at the bottom and then it matched actual hourly earnings.   Still it doesn't look like a break even, but it is much closer.   
Ok the reason I'm gaining is because I wrote a bot that now buys GHS in small blocks and sells it back when there is a reasonable profit to do so.  It is trading about 40% (and growing) of my holdings.   Without that I would still at a loss.   However, small trading gains but mining block awards is currently resulting in modest daily gains.  (~.5%+ per day)  If I can't make a profit trading GHS, I just let it mine and that reduces and loss or pulls it back to profit assuming I do sell before the price of GHS drops big time again. 
Where else could I do that?

My thoughts exactly!
