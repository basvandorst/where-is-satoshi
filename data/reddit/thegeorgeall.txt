Honestly this idea would be such an awesome gift. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:12:36
This is the greatest post of all time. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:48:12
Tried. Still the same problem.

Ok thanks
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:48:25
Sum Ting Wong!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:19:46
Thank you for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:55:09
You mean 15.5k... wtf

Soon I'll be able to pay bribes in bitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:11:43
I've just received my Ledger Nano S.
Hardware wallets are a completely new thing to me as I've only ever used the Mycelium App. Some people in the past have suggested testing my capability of 'wiping' the wallet and attempting to restore it using my seed. In case of a worst case scenario.
I somewhat understand this principal but I really want to be as safe as possible. 
Where should I start? I have it next to me on my desk staring at me and we are both confused. Thanks in advance for any advice.

Fuck off!

So happy I bought litecoin at $50. Was slightly "too late" for bitcoin
(Bought between $4,800 - $10,600)
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:50
Ok thanks. Was starting to get nervous. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:11:24
Just spam. A website where you invest 0.01 bitcoin and get back like 0.1 bitcoin a week or some nonsense. It didn't even make sense. Like 1000% returns a week or some shit.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:43:18
I can help with that... 
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:10:29
Thanks mate. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:47:05
No I don't that sentence works.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:29:38
Ok, thanks. Going to do some research about the topic now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:10:20
Man why you poaching your sister's eggs?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:51:33
Why? Serious question, I have no idea what's happening...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:57:39
Nothing ever happens!
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:27:17
RemindMe! 3 years
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:15:04
Thanks, I appreciate the response. I'll backup my wallet this morning.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:17:26
So I googled what backing up entailed and found a Reddit post stating that my backup is my 12 words. Is that correct? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:14:13
I use luno too. But I feel the fees are high too? Never used another exchange so I may be wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:42:48
Is mining viable for people with limited funds?
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:06:33
I live in a South Africa. Gets really hot here. Lol.
To be honest I'm not technologically able enough to mine bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:26:56
Hi, I see you have answered a couple questions already so sorry if this has been answered. I'm a total noob and I just one to confirm a thing or two.
I'm currently holding a small amount of BTC on mycelium. I do not care for B2X at all. If I just leave my Bitcoin in Mycelium will everything be ok during the fork. I don't really understand the replay stuff. 
So all I want to know really is, is my bitcoin safe from 'attack' or any other misfortune in mycelium, in particular during the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:20:54
When will the Lightning Network be active?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:14:18
Yes. Preferably everyone.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:11:57
All I want is a solid dip...
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:39:52
Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:24:32
Will do. Thanks for the response and advice. I'm still very new. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:42:46
Did this strategy work? Asking for a friend....
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:05:47
$100,000,000 per bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:17:14
Fuck man. Really?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:54:46
I wasn't invested during Mt Gox. But I was 'following' bitcoin cause of a friend. I'll do some research on Tether and Bitfnex. Cheers.

@_date: 2017-11-20 08:48:07
3-8 months? You going to buy back in when bitcoin is $15,000?
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:32:47
Laughed hard about that comment while at work in South Africa :D
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:09:38
I'm a noob to bitcoin. What does owning my keys mean? And what benefit does it serve? I purchased bitcoin but never received my own keys and now store it on Mycelium, is that Ok? Also what's happening on the 18th? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:15:51
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:18:41
You know bitcoin will reach $65K? I'm not the most clued up regarding the market at all, or bitcoin for that matter. So how do you guys predict future value?
