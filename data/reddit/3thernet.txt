Hey there. 
your options are: 
1. to buys some
-exchanges like bitpay or coinbase
2. provide a service for bitcoin and be part of the eco-system. 
price can go to zero or  millions. This is a type of thing that has never been done. Don't play with your hard earn savings

I remember. 
I found out about it on the JRE podcast late 2013 at like 4 PM on my way home from work! I stayed up till like 2 am reading and watching videos about it. GF was not impressed. And then I remember I woke up the next morning and it was like OMG OMG OMG all over again! That was not a dream!

Ethereum, but thats not an altcoin. Look into it. You can't buy coins right now anyway, but ignore the downvotes and keep an eye on it.

Checkout this crypto-bitcoin rap. It's actually good

It means you didn't comprehend any of the lyrics. You didn't listen to it, which is fine. But keep your dumb comments to yourself. 
who do you think satoshi is?

so here is the thing! It seems like RT is talking a lot about bitcoin and if Putin was really anti-bitcoin they would either talk shit about it and make fun of it, or ignore it completely. And we all know that RT won't do anything Putin doesn't want. So, this is good news! Russia is not going to ban bitcoin.  That dude probably owns a few coins lel
