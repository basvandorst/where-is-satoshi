Because I bought $50 last night.

I've got a chrome plugin to turn subreddit style off. Makes everything vanilla.

Ahh. I was similar and bought at 16.5k and just broke even tonight. It'll hit 20k soon enough.
For those of us who hodl. Do we ever sell? Is this retirement money? I've been thinking about when would I sell and haven't found a good benchmark yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:27:02
Agreed. There was more extreme variation at the dips with the sell walls at every $50. This is methodically climbing up.

Just had my first moon ride tonight. I was just trading back and forth &lt;20 min dips and rises, everything going well looking at maybe making 5% growth tonight. When suddenly 200 btc just drops into the buy market and up we go!

Sorry guys, no 17k tonight. I just bought some.

Giving out your SSN is too unsecure for you? I would recommend reading into just how unsecure your SSN is. Chances are your information is already compromised and sold.
TL;DR If you haven't already purchased credit and identity theft protection you're doing it wrong.

Well...you will still be liable for the tax. It just won't be reported to the IRS. So don't do something dumb and write about your tax evasion on the internet.

It's like a cooldown timer on a video game.

Are there any other forks that we should claim? I've had mine since 2013.

Yes, you log in to gdax with your same credentials from coinbase they transfer from on wallet to the other.
Plenty of youtube videos show it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:52:12
What is binance advantage over gdax?

That is basically what his post said. It's a lot of reading but it's there.

I bought $50 5 years ago in college back when it spiked to 300/btc. My econ professor would make fun of it when it would drop 50% in an hour. Well now it's worth $3k. 
So it's up to you but I would recommend diversity. $50 in bitcoin and $10 into 5 alt coins.

When I installed google authenticator a couple years back they gave me 5 codes. These codes were to be written down and stored somewhere safe which would allow one time access into my account. As far as I know if you don't have any other ways in to your account (like alternate email, security questions, etc) then that's the last line.

So as far as I am understanding the whole philosophy behind coinbase. We give up a part of the bitcoin service (anonymity) for the ease of use (direct bank account linking). 
This sounds like a great service and works great for me. But what about when I want that anonymity back? 
Can I create a new anonymous wallet and send my bitcoins there and would that then give me full access to my bitcoins but in a now anonymous format? Or are the bitcoins that pass through coinbase always connected to me?
