idgaf, use it or don’t. Obviously you’re not a regular reddit user cause if I was soliciting or a lurker you can find out via my public post history.
I’m done with this person. ✋
To those who utilize this, happy HODL.

First dip = a mistake
Second dip = a pattern
Third dip = a program (bless their hearts, time to get rich)
We will be able to have money waiting in reserve to buy the predicted dip. So we will have to see.

By using BTC in simple transactions. You expand mass adoption which increases the coins value
If you see a store or service that takes bitcoin. Use it. Ask the clerk or owner how the adoption has been going? Offer to pass out business cards or word of mouth. 
If you invested $1000 in BTC. I would set aside 5-10% to trade in goods and services. Outside of your initial investment.
Circulation of the currency is good.
If we want crypto to be adopted by the masses we have to not just invest but have discussions, buy and sell with the masses using BTC.
Mark Cuban’s move to take bitcoin next season is HUGE and Square just gave me access to buying BTC within the Square app. Take advantage of these opportunities cause these businesses will shut it down quickly if the cost benefit isn’t worth it and people aren’t voting with their digital wallet over their fiat wallet.

I agree. My words were very tort. I was angry when I came across the person who Chase account was closed out.
My empathetic side took over.
The boy who cried wolf scenario was my platform and it just came out with what you see here. My previous post fell on deaf ears and I deleted it cause people assumed I was attempting to sell or promote this product.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:04:55
Ok, but we still don't know the bottom. Regardless if this is FUD. Weak hands are pushing the price downwards.

One of its main features is the ability to be a discreet merchant. Say a transaction came from “JOES HARDWARE” or PRIVACY.COM when it posts to your actual bank statements online or on paper.

I know you can dispute a charge. Check the sites FAQs to see.

Dude, cool your jets. I don’t work for the fucking company, this is about buying crypto, not about whatever your little isolated use case is.
The virtual card is a conduit to your actual bank routing/account numbers. If your situation with that shitty person gets that bad. Call you bank and ask for their help.

Am I the only one who got an immediate flashback to Mike Judge’s Idiocracy movie? Or should I say flash forward to the year 2550.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:08:59
Enough of the FUD. Futures are here and soon ETFs and ETNs.  You think big money seeing these type of gains will let a bunch old ass thinkers interrupt their path to more riches.
I think you need to look up the term lobbyists.

Amazing. Looking forward to being in your shoes in the next 3-5 years.
Thanks for the advice regarding crypto. But I leave you with this advice, please keep your pulse on fiat.
It’s not going anywhere anytime soon but it can eat you alive as well.

Thanks. I know better.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:02:37
Thank you. I bought in  you’re expecting a 50% pullback? Jeez...
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:54:14
I could just swallow the coin base and credit card fee but shit that’s too high a price to pay. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:51:45
Pending any dips or moonshots. I could double up some weeks to lessen the time. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:40:27
I guess keep investing and HODLing. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:33:47
I use Privacy.com to add an extra layer of protection with my bank and credit cards.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:42:35
Yeah agreed. I also think about the chance of hyperinflation of the dollar happening one day.

 That’s amazon for you. [Amazon](

Is this bad or good for us who use Coinbase as an exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:59:21
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:59:14
Those were the minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:39:27
Agreed, even if this was a Purse.io purchase, still too much. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:29:42
I’m thinking this is a good investment once you surpass 1BTC. Does anyone have one? Plan on purchasing one?
For $440, seems like the “hardcore HODLR” gadget. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:36:21
But those theories are vapid. What about an actual matter of fact that it is discovered unequivocally that ISIS sent 45BTC to person A in the US to conduct a terrorist act?
Do we just shrug our shoulders and keep HODLing or take action and defend?
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:43:00
Both probably. But I’m sure Barry said it first. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:17:47
I’ve had this for quite some time now. But only used it once in awhile for purchases. I haven’t seen this pushed to be used on here so I hope it can be useful.
You can set monthly, daily, weekly limits, make a burner card for one-off uses and put a limit on how much the virtual card and be charged for.
Clean interface and an awesome iOS app.

To my last comment, does it have a lifetime warranty?
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:32:57
My concern is the lifespan on theses devices if you plan on putting your crypto on deep freeze for a decade or more will it survive long enough for you to retrieve or transfer to another hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:21:44
1,000,000 BTC x 8,115 = KING OF HODL
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:26:28
Trust me I am but I’m waiting for my GDAX deposits to post so I can buy 1LTC and 1ETH.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:54:36
They partnered with IOTA so use that as a username.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:51:07
This chat is simply showing that you can’t HODL if the market becomes stable.
