Yeah because all workplaces are going to pay you cash in hand and not into a bank account. Also keeping a large amount of cash at home is a really fucking dumb idea. You get robbed and that's your life fucked. How you gonna pay for home insurance to cover that robbery without dealing with a bank? Whether you like it or not Banks are ingrained into western society and it is incredibly difficult to live without them anyone who says otherwise is fooling themselves.

They sell shits? That is an odd business idea.

Storing anything super valuable at home without some kind of insurance is dumb. Banks are built to be incredibly secure and are backed up by services like the FSCS (UK) that provide you compensation if those funds are ever lost. Would it be nice to go without a bank? Absolutely. Is it realistic? No.

Something is wrong with coinbase/gdax clearly. No one is going to buy Bcash at $9500 with other exchanges trading at half that.

I do mine shit at the moment. Should I stop selling it and start storing it?

No one can sell/buy at this price. Coinbase/GDAX hasn't enabled buying/selling Bcash yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:19
Coinbase and GDAX are one and the same. Most other exchanges have it at $3700ish. Something fishy here.

Is that an offer?

Ehhh. Even if Cryptos do become the primary currencies these people have set themselves up that they'll have enough fiat to move across into Crypto when that time comes. Would they make more IF they hodled and IF Bitcoin succeeds? Sure but that's a lot of ifs. Cashing out now and going Debt free is an amazing achievement and they're in a great place
