putting it together we realized how far bitcoin has come since early 2013 (though there's still a ways to go!)

It might be more of the principle of it for small businesses, plus scale if enough small businesses do it. If you make $300 in Bitcoin profit a month, using Namecheap for your web host would be enough. If publicizing the pledge could up your sales by 10% to make $330, then you're covered!
But yeah for the bitcoin economy to mature the small businesses need to get in it as well or the bitcoin would just circulate among a handful of large companies.

thanks for the feedback! we update daily - we hope we can get people spending and earning more bitcoin...

right that's exactly the problem. the bitcoin they earn gets instantly converted into dollars instead of circulating among other bitcoin businesses.

Yeah but I think the next step is having more bitcoin being spent and earned, spread out among many players and transactions, rather than having most of it sitting in investment silos. 
10% of everyone's investment moving around would probably help us get there much quicker. It's a bit of a tragedy of the commons problem, not enough of us want to spend our bitcoin b/c we expect it's going to appreciate further, but if no one spends their bitcoin we're not getting to take off. 
The workaround is if we all spend some small fraction of it, *especially* if you are consistently earning bitcoin income (since your stock of bitcoin doesn't necessarily have to decrease), hence businesses large and small are a natural candidate for a spend 10% pledge.

do you know if they spend any of it as bitcoin? I guess if any business would it would be overstock. The man's a believer.

sorry, please try the link again! we've updated it with the correct link. they have a mirror bitcoin site with a slightly different selection which has the btc option. let us know if you still have problems.
