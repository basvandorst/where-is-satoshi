Theoretically what happens if you lose all u2f keys? Do you pretty much have to talk directly to the service provider e.g. GitHub

You did nothing wrong thx for reporting

At least spell ethereum correctly. I'd be interested in seeing a more detailed breakdown of the predictions.
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:52:00
It's ur fucking mail providers fault bro
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:42:45
Ok great
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:10:15
Extremely limited perspective, open ya mind son
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:20:35
Where can I download the entire issue
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:03:01
Exactly 
@_date: 2016-11-22 02:08:03
Anyone can build on top of the ethereum blockchain tho, just like btc

As usual ends up not being coinbase's fault. People are so quick to jump on coinbase when they've done loads for Bitcoin and the space. I'm cool with bringing up actual issues but the witch hunt aspect needs to stop in this community.

Meh, it's a step in the right direction 
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:52:38
Not sure what this accomplishes
@_date: 2016-12-12 23:02:09
But is it possible
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:51:53
Developer salaries 
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:48:37
Don't be a dick
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:12:05
@_date: 2016-11-09 13:13:59
I feel like they could...?
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:29:25
Can I use Authy to log into Mac OS 
@_date: 2016-09-21 16:25:04
Bitcoin is to incentive snitches 
@_date: 2016-09-07 18:30:49
Yea there's no point in involving btc, I agree
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:55:16
Good point
@_date: 2016-09-21 15:55:46
This post is FUD. I use the app and you can definitely sell out of it if you want to. Personally I like the new approach, it's my go to price ticker on iOS. Are you saying that every time an app adds or removes a feature they have to completely rebrand?
@_date: 2016-09-17 17:25:26
So what's the solution? What are some ideas?
@_date: 2016-10-01 19:16:07
No offense, seems a little left field to me
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:48:41
Good thing we have competent people like you doing big things for the space
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:53:16

@_date: 2016-10-22 06:14:56
Added a lil click bait 
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:47:39
Go on

The experience of buying in the us with kraken was not so good last I checked, do they support ach or debit cards yet?
