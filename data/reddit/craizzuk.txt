Read it as spam for pumpkins at first

Do I need to be verified and all that?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:49:22
So I have mine in a ledger now. What do I need to do during the next for? How do I get the coins?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:31:11
What's the best way to sell if you bought from coinbase but store on ledger?
Is it safe to transfer back to coinbase when it got to the point like it did?
I'm holding now, but it's good to know for the future.

Literally could not buy during the dip, so frustrating. And a lot of exchanges are backlogged on new users so no joy there. Who's dick do I have to suck to buy some fucking crypto round here?

So how would an average Joe capitalise on this? Never bought shares.

It's pretty unprecedented in that they have just come into this wealth and are giving 95% away off the bat. Not decades after loving comfortably like most philanthropists

Have a good day ��

My coin is sitting in a legacy ledger wallet. If someone could give me a step by step guide to get it to segwit I would do it.

@_date: 2018-03-21 20:34:59
I'm sorted

If I have a ledger nano and my 24 word written down am I ok?
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:58:11
What is this "free coins"?
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:39:47
Never disclose full pog holdings

Don't let the price tag put you off, it's a whole new world. But don't let the pressures of society determine what you want to do with your life, it's yours. But trust me, it's nothing to be afraid about.

Just had the same email from coinbase

whats an ICO?
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:51:53
I'm trying to get in by buying on coinbase but my transactions keep declining. I sent my drivers license as verification. Any idea what's going on?
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:44:48
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:52:43
Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:15:54
What's up with this? I'm trying to buy and signed up to these. No good?
