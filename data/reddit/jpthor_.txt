LN is practically unlimited. 
100% SegWit with fully stacked blocks at roughly 3.7mw with maximum number of batched transaction can do 10-15k "payments" (multiple input and output transactions). This is 2-3m transactions per day; 30-40 tps.
This is enough to onboard the entire world's population over 5-10 years; assuming one channel per person.

They could certainly try to lend out Bitcoin on paper 10:1; but as soon as there is a run, the lender would be bankrupt or be forced to use it's own assets to buy bitcoin.

The knapsack problem is a well-known NP-complete problem where it is hard to calculate but easy to verify. 
It is impossible (for now) to easily calculate what items aka transactions to include in the knapsack aka block, if each transaction has a random and different weight and value. 
In order to stay under the block limit miners will grab the minimum number of highest value transactions that result in the largest fees but still be below the block limit in terms of weight.
If they make a mistake and grab too many transactions that exceed the limit, the block they created is invalid and they wasted their time. 
The likelihood they will accidentally exceed the block limit increases the higher the number of items they include. So they will always prefer the low quantity; high value transactions instead of high quantity low value.
There's no easy fix with a Blockchain that has block limits. It's a very well-known problem.

Topological transaction ordering (TTOR) requires nodes to access the topology as part of the block, so it isn't as simple as sorting by sat/byte.

The business case around lightning network needs to mature but it will get there. You will end up opening a channel to a party who has enough liquidity to fund the channel
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:40:40
Not necessarily; you will soon be able to splice out some of the channel. ie; I am a merchant and have 1 BTC in accumulated inbounds on my channel to the local node. I can splice out 0.9 BTC without closing the channel. Or I can simply send 0.9 BTC to a local exchange who will send me 0.9 BTC worth of cash for expenses.

It's important because it means 1) SegWit is increasing adoption and 2) miners are becoming more effective at selecting and mining bigger blocks. It also means more transactions are being batched as those transactions are slightly heavier than single input/output tx.
Overall this is good news. I expect to see 3mb+ blocks fairly soon as SegWit and batching is further adopted. 
Even if we try and obbaorf 4bn people on to lightning, it will take 10-20 years u less we get to full Segwit; in which case we can get it down to 4-8 years

Well IMO it comes down to usability. If I can hoard nothing but Bitcoin (ie no cash) but still very easily pay with it, then I can hoard AND spend at the same time. I would not need to keep cash for groceries when I can use Bitcoin for groceries.

The author misuses Gresham's Law. Gresham's Law is "bad money drives out good money *only if required to accept both at the same value*"
This applied to physical coins where the face value was lower than the base value. People would hoard good coins and only spend bad coins.  When allowed to transact in any currency people choose; we see the opposite to Gresham's Law; that is Thier's Law where all money ends up being the same. 
If an individual had one choice; they would hoard all their money in the asset that has the best current and future store of value; traditionally Gold, but because Gold isn't ideal money, they need a "cash account" for daily expenses. 
For the first time ever we can hoard in the best store of value asset, while at the same time being able to use it as Currency

Bitcoin remains the only Blockchain project to have completely anonymous and unknown founders. Thus it cannot be matched. MoE and SoV is a winner-take-all and Bitxoin has really the only fundamentals that matter. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 09:29:15
Exactly. We needed to fix and optimise Bitcoin first before we go crazy on blocksizes. SegWit Schnorr and MAST will mean when we do go to bigger blocks (we will) then we don't end up with a bloated Blockchain we can never prune off.  We are only ever under 200 Gb Blockchain size once!

As soon as u broadcast a signed Bitcoin transaction it is propagated across the network by nodes (not miners!). Nodes simply check the tx is valid (signature) and if it is, they rebroadcast it to all other nodes they connect to (usually 8). After 6 hops (6 degrees of freedom) the entire network should have it. The Time to propagate is roughly:
6 * AverageNodeLatency + 6 * AverageTxValidation.
Roughly: 6 * 250ms + 6 * 10ms = &lt; 2 seconds to get over the entire Bitcoin network (apart from very far away nodes)
Note: it still hasn't been mined.
When it does get mined the block is propagated thru the same means. There's a validation and a latency time. 
So the bot is basically a node downloading signed tx's and trying g to solve for weak private keys until it finds one.

BTC Hash rates will continue to rise until the cost of mining a Bitcoin match the price. Currently on cheap or subsidised electricity estimates have around $3-4k to mine a Bitcoin around 5-6c/kwh. So we'll keep seeing hash rates added whilst:
1) BTC Price increases above $7-8k
2) Electricity prices decrease below 5-6c/kwh

Bitmain failing to IPO from getting wrecked on BCH + mistiming the ASIC cycle is a beautiful thing for Bitcoin. They were such a parasitic bad actor on the space. There is a huge list:
- backdooring ASICs
- mining using customer inventory before shipping
- secret ASICs
- covert ASIC boost
- opposing SegWit 
- propping up BCash
- offensive patents
- mining empty blocks
- mis-use of version but space
We've finally crossed the ASIC monopoly and now have an emerging competitive market. Bitcoin has won
@_date: 2019-04-26 09:08:48
The authors of that paper (Dryga and Poon) are no longer involved in LN.
We absolutely do not need to increase the blocksize.
High fees creates economic imperative, which creates innovation, but not at the cost of security, in fact it's opposite.
Just like today you can co-ordinate to mix your Bitcoin on Wasabi, you will be able to co-ordinate to enter into a nested lightning channel - onboarding hundreds potentially thousands of new users for every on-chain transaction.
The current blocksize is fine and doesn't need to change.

Segwit was pushed back hard from Bitmain because it destroyed their covert ASIC boost scheme.
It was then hijacked by big blockers who tried to use it for their agenda of increasing the block size, hence SegWit2x (NYA).
There is no antagonist in the case of Schnorr. Bcash are boasting they will implement it first, so it doesn't look like it will be rail-roaded by them either.
The only organisation who in theory should oppose it are Goverments who want to prevent the privacy enhancements that it brings.
However it seems they either don't understand it and/or have been distracted by the allure of the lush green fields of Ethereum.

If Greg sees this: my point is that the process for choosing the chaintip should never be prior to the coinbase unlocking at 100 blocks. 
This will always remove doubt that there *may* have been an alternative chain and the wrong blockhash was added.
If an emergency build is shipped fast in the future with a poorly-chosen blockhash this may cause issues.
Best to just follow a common-sense procedure from the start
@_date: 2019-04-19 11:06:40
Thanks. But "I looked for a competing chain and couldn't find one" is a fairly weak argument when choosing a chaintip that has a very very low chance of being incorrect.
I think there should be a LOT MORE due process and nuetrality around something as important as putting a psuedo-checkpoint into the client

Ethereum presents all the qualities that would be desirable for authoritarian governments such as socialist control, centralised seignorage and plutocracy.
It's an easy mark. If Ethereum gains widespread enterprise and government adoption then everything from the previous playbook can be ported from the old world to the new.
Blockchains that have Enterprise Alliances, Diversity initiatives and constant global campaigning are being primed to power the future control system. Make no mistake. 
Which is fine. I dig it. Bitcoin will continue to absorb and emerge as the single value transport system that is free from control and influence.

Legacy: starts with 1. Pay to public key hash. Don't use these.
Compatibility: starts with 3. Pay to script hash. Better privacy. Compatible with SegWit.
SegWit: starts with bc1. Pay to witness script hash. Smallest weight.
It will come down to the wallet you use. If you aren't sure just use the 3 addresses. 
If you want to get involved with lightning then use the bc1 address

Learn what Bitcoin actually is and why it does, and you realise nothing can replace it.

Bitcoin doesn't waste energy.
Bitcoin offers 12.5BTC plus fees as an incentive for anyone with the necessary infrastructure to process the transactions.
That's around $70k ish.
So people will naturally spend around $70kish on energy to chase the margin.
If Bitcoin was worth 100times more today, then yes, people will spend 100times more in energy to chase that margin.
The good thing about this is that the cheapest energy sources will offer the best margins - increasingly this is coming from renewable energy sources.
I believe in the next decade we will see the first commercial nuclear reactors come back online to solely mine Bitcoin. As well as huge solar/wind farms.
This is a good thing

Not if considering OP's payments as income. 
If OP was *meant* to be paid $60k in income, but due to loss of value in the process of selling to cash they were only paid $50k, the reasonable position is to declare an income only of $50k
If however, OP treated the payments as part investment, Thrn they would need to track capital gain/loss

This "argument" has to be the most ill-researched argument against Bitcoin out there. The logic behind the counter-argument can be so easily sourced. Here from Wikipedia:
"One approach estimate external costs of environmental impact of electricity is the Methodological Convention of Federal Environment Agency of Germany. That method arrives at external costs of electricity from lignite at 10.75 Eurocent/kWh, from hard coal 8.94 Eurocent/kWh, from natural gas 4.91 Eurocent/kWh, from photovoltaic 1.18 Eurocent/kWh, from wind 0.26 Eurocent/kWh and from hydro 0.18 Eurocent/kWh.[31] "
Thanks to Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment, miners are in a perpetual pursuit of:
- Cheaper energy
- Faster chips
- More Power efficient chips
The first is by far and away the most important factor the miner can influence. They will always be pursuing cheaper energy. Once Bitcoin becomes un-profitable to mine at 5c/kwh (current estimated break-even) then miners MUST source &lt;5c/kwh. And as u can see above, this is only from renewables. 
Very soon it will be 4c/kwh, then 3, then 2. Etc.  Bitcoin mining will single-handedly drive us faster into global renewables than anything else, since the speed of investment/payback is faster than anything else, and it has very few other influences.

Tax is simple. You pay tax on any income u receive. 
To find your income you sum everything you were paid, then apply your tax rate to that.
If the Bitcoin you had INCREASED in value whilst u held it (before u sold it) then u need to add that increase to your total income.
If it decreased, then simply decrease your total income by the same amount.
If u immediately sold the Bitcoin (inside of a few days) and any difference in price between your employer paying u and u selling is negligible then disregard it

No, your wallet set a default fee that didn't match your time preferences.
I always make 1 sat/byte, it always gets confirmed and I pay pennies.
If your wallet provider won't let you set 1 sat/byte then change wallets.
