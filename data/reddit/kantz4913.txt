Idk, this meme supports BCH
@_date: 2018-09-29 15:12:54
Then it goes to 1$ once you buy it
@_date: 2018-08-23 06:54:56
Yeah ppl are so impatient... Go to a casino.

Wow ok, Thanks, those are good points that completely went over my head while being triggered. I must say i like that last thing you mentioned "you need to adapt", and that goes for both Crypto and the banking system. There shouldn't be any toxic attitude (such as FUD) between  each other.

Well, i can only agree with the volatility issue. The "users are not protected" and "is not backed by anyone" is just bullshit.

He's using fiat? Despicable.

You mean the dad right? If he risks his ETH for BTC he has no value as a person. Would've let it pass if he was promised more eth. So dumb lol.

You could get a juicy bitcoin cash for that today

Well i can't seem to find a payment system that allows me to get paid as easily as it is with Crypto-currency.
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:25:33
Thancc very much
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:14:14
Yeah, i hate the price fluctuates so much. Idiots that just want money investing should get -20% and go broke cuz of it.... I just want to send and receive how it's intended 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:49:25
Wow that sucks
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:56:26
I don't get it... If i paid in bitcoin, following the example 0.01btc to buy stuff. Then i lose my bitcoin and get my stuff for the price the Bitcoin is worh at the time, then i should be free and the seller (who received the Bitcoin a payment) is the one who has to deal with the capital gains not me, Am i wrong?

That's what you should do after drinking alcohol, remember the euphoria, so you can stand the hangover after it xD
