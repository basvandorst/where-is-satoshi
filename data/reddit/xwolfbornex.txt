Is it possible that what they mean is that they bought a certain value of BTC and they will give it away via an integrated colored coin network which is interchangeable in value with BTC? I think thats what I'm getting out of this all ambiguity.

Outside of the notes they will gift out at the start, don't you need to buy them? I doubt it youre getting them for upvotes, more like reddit gold.

edit: any suggestions on how I go about it? Setting up a wallet and all?
@_date: 2015-01-31 10:46:25
No faucets where I live :(
@_date: 2015-01-31 11:37:18
So buying it is the only viable option? Damn capitalism.
@_date: 2015-01-31 11:22:29
