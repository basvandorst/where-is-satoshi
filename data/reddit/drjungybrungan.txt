Trash talking and death threats are two different things.

What are the numbers on this? It's pretty meaningless to have a heat map and not have a key.

I am familiar with that video, and think it very much describes this sub.
I actually thought about linking to it when I made my post, because it explains perfectly why the rational discussion is drowned out by the screaming, which is exactly my problem with @_date: 2015-04-17 01:46:14
I used to enjoy conversation in this subreddit. I used to visit, discuss my thoughts on the economics behind bitcoin, and in general had a great experience. 
The subreddit isn't toxic because of outsiders, it's been destroyed from the inside. Buttcoin made me realize how cult-like and ridiculous a lot of the users here are. Discussions have stopped being about what Bitcoin is, and have become about how Bitcoin is essentially a digital god. All hints of civility went out the window, and instead I found myself attacked for having views that were contrary to the idea that bitcoin is perfect.
I follow buttcoin, because I still care about bitcoin and the technology, but I like to view it through a more realistic lens. 
This subreddit tore itself apart by radicalizing.

Or neither. Interest on Required reserves is a frequent source

Nope. The bank pays the insurance premium.

Double Standard? 
If BOA is hacked, BOA loses money. Mine is insured, so I lose nothing.
Bitcoin? I can watch my savings disappear right in front of me.

Not entirely sure what you mean here, but banks offer a lot of services that the blockchain simply cannot.
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:23:42
Because they don't want to lose money?
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:57:04
The video series you posted is not quite accurate.
Essentially it says that by lending money that does not exist, banks are "creating" it. There are two types of reserves that a bank deals with; required and excess. Required are what they need to have at all times to satisfy a certain amount of demand (i.e withdraws), excess is anything on top of that. If a bank lends money that they do not have, they pull it out of the required reserves and then go ahead and essentially take loans out from other banks to make up for that.
What the video describes as "creating" money, is simply a shortsighted view. 
Where the Fed gets involved is if required reserves drop across the board, they step in and provide more money. This is a whole different animal that I have no interest in discussing because my own view is that this is where the banking industry goes wrong, but the rest stands up perfectly fine.

Interest rates and inelastic demand...care to elaborate? Because neither of those buzzwords proves anything.

The issue with that way of thinking is assuming that your stake in the economy is in a perfect vacuum where it can only increase. Let's say demand for your widgits plummets due to people saving more of their money. Suddenly, you're out of a job, and while your stake in the economy may be increasing at the rate of deflation, you will quickly realize that will not be enough to keep you going.
In a deflationary economy, job loss is among the biggest concerns associated with a lack of demand. The "demand for everything will fall if everyone is saving!" though process sounds ridiculous at first, but when you think about it on an economy-wide scale it can be devastating.

The bank did. So yes, essentially the money does magically appear back in my account.
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:08:58
Not necessarily. A lot of banks use interest from their Required Reserves to pay for it.
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:30:21
If my bank gets robbed, it doesn't effect me at all because my money is insured. I lose nothing, the bank takes the loss.
If bitcoins are hacked, they're gone.

It's not about instant gratification either though. Think about large scale projects, deflation will cut the ROR on them massively. Large infrastructure or investment projects will be deemed too expensive.
@_date: 2015-02-14 02:34:55
I know what the words mean, doesn't mean that they mean anything in your context. You've defined them, but still not related them in any way to the discussion in an intelligent way. I know what interest rates are and how they operate, did you know that in a deflationary economy that they are essentially meaningless? Real interest rates skyrocket if deflation increases.
And "BS consumer goods"? Is that a joke? Think about large scale investment. If I have $100 million dollars to invest in a project, say a wind farm. That project has a ROR of 3% per year, but deflation is 3.5%. I won't invest. That's a $100 million project that in your world has no value.
But go on, dog, tell me to read a book.
@_date: 2015-02-14 00:35:59
Necessities don't change, but I can probably venture a guess that if you have a job, it isn't in something that we couldn't live without. The United States is a 70% service based economy, and a large amount of those would be severely undervalued in a deflationary economy.
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:26:28
Holy hell it blows my mind that there are people that actually think this is how the economy works.
1. Banks don't create money. They might lend money that they don't have but the money exists.
2. Yeah a bank robbery isn't going to increase inflation. The money still exists. It's not like it disappeared and the Fed thought "Shit we have to print more!" while twirling their mustaches.

Buzzword: an important-sounding usually technical word or phrase often of little meaning used chiefly to impress laymen
You have no idea what you're talking about, so you use economic terms (albeit simple ones at that) to make it seem like you do.
