They use Tether tokens,  not sure how this effects things.

The technical solution is to batch their transactions.

Same here. It reset my gem address when the app updated.

So people paid 1 btc for this?

I've been following one of the addresses around this morning. 
It seems like it is all being sent through a tumbler, but since the tumbler is only mixing much smaller amounts otherwise, it is kind of easy to follow it around. 
I have ended up on this address
It has a balance of 28 BTC right now and has 1 conformation. This address has been used since 1/06/14. Is this part of the mixer addresses still? I assume so but not sure. Anyways if you had money there keep following the trail.

I keep telling everyone 6k by the end of the year. And now even I am starting to believe it.

Don't you mean the Market Cap? Not BTC-long positions?

I was making a joke, of course i believe it. And there goes the joke about 10 miles over your head.

In short one can attest to the realness of the original video by using a combination of techniques. If I produce a video, the contents will never change. I can take a MD5 hash of the original video at the time of completion. Now all I have to store on the blockchain is the name of the video and the MD5 checksum. Now in the future I can validate the file using the information that was saved when the video was made.

Right now I've been using bitquick.co to sell my btc. I like how little of a hassle the whole thing is. And I can just reload my btc to the same address and keep all my settings.

They have actually taken the github down so we cannot see who commited the code. We can however still do a little research and find out that:
*Bitmain previously was going to launch a service called Minerlink. This service never launched, but it was intended get the “real-time miner status remotely”. There is probably a feature that allows you to make sure that the only miners submitting work for you are your miners, hence the need for an auth url. It is also possible that another feature was to allow you to remotely stop a machine from mining if it were misbehaving. This would explain why this code was put there in the first place. However, since minerlink does not exist, this functionality is now a liability and should have been removed long ago.* [source](
* We started to develop this feature since Antminer S7 and wanted to finish its development on the Antminer S9. We hoped to make it a useful feature that we could advertise to our customers. But, due to some technical problems, we were unable to finish the development of this feature and shut down the testing server in December 2016. *[source] (
So we know that Bitmain was developing a new product called MinerLink which never was completed as well as starting to work on the code base that would be finalized in a future version. If you do not think the CEO was involved in setting up and overseeing the production of a new product line you are being purposely obtuse and are showing your true colors.
I like that you have moved the goalposts a little bit, by stating  "nefarious purposes" which from all accounts seems to not be the intent, which then just leave us with the fact that they left code in their codebase that made their product a security issue. No big deal though right, it wasn't on purpose.
Anyways, there is your proof that he directed the creation of Antbleed.


bitcoin-dev mailing list notification of potential use of an ASICBoost to increase profits. Followed by Bitmain patenting the tech in China. Followed by an admission of using the technology on Bitcoins Testnet. They however have denied they used it on the mainnet.
Also do not get confused as there is overt and covert ASICBoost, we are talking about COVERT here.
[This is a good summary of what has been found about their use of covert ASICBoost](


This was already answered and is a longer topic deserving its own thread. That being said make sure your read their BIP148 contingency plan, a little technical but gets the point across. 


O the irony. It took me all of 15 minutes with a coffee to research these topics to be able to present some sources to the claims. 
I would suggest you do the minimum of a google search before spending so much time ..... not thinking too critically.

Of the world's $294 trillion in financial assets, global stock market capitalization has grown to $69 trillion dollars from $34 trillion in 2008.
So technically to reach the 22T crypto would need to absorb about 1/8 of global assets. Is that not reasonable?

Stocks, bonds, and real estate assets and transactions will move to crypto in the same way the NYSE moved away from paper to computers years ago. The process of converting those platforms to crypto is still largely an unknown. Although there are a lot of people working on use cases all the time right now. Once the same security regulations and protections are in place via maybe Security Tokens, and regulated exchanges much like the NYSE and CME come online for crypto you will see the money start to really move around.
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:28:39
You are not grasping the concept here. Much like the dot com boom and email, people were like "Why do I need to email some one when I can call them, no one will ever use email, your insane!" 
Once Security Tokens, and regulated exchanges much like NYSE and CME come online you will see what I am talking about.

I have shares in the market, I trade their quite frequently because of the 0% fees. So I usually have some mining power already there. If I point my miners to ghash, it just ups my payouts, so instead of paying more fees for moving my BTC around and mining at diff pools I do it all at one. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:11:20
Bter has great support for their api. Someone on git hub has created a Bter api wrapper already too, just like btce.

You can use Digital Ocean or Amazon but I don't think you will easily find what you are looking for. Do some research yourself instead of asking people to provide it for you.
@_date: 2013-10-21 03:50:49
bitcoincharts.com is a start. Also  too. There are a lot of them try the bitcoin wiki page. Google search helps too..

You are being overly paranoid. Nobody hacked your computer and changed directories. 
Also you can't get malware uploading a file. The great thing about malware is the end user has to open a file or executable for the malware to execute. 
For example: I goto xxx.com and click one a link and then click again or d/L and execute the file then I am infected. Just like email too, people send attachments that are malware as spam all the time, I just don't open the attachments. 
So then my question to you is this:what site did you goto and click on a link to d/l the malware and then execute it? 
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:22:20
Cryptsy or bter.com or vicurex?  Cryptsy has the most volume next to btce. I wouldn't get to involved with an exchange with low volume. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:40:18
Be careful, cryptsy runs REALLY SLOW with deposits, withdraws, and canceling trades. They said they are upgrading so it should be better soon, but right now, just know you might have some sloooow tranasctions. 
I will add their support is fantastic though. I will return to their platform when they get better response times.

There is a payment calculator. There is no way to buy bitcoin with credit.
I think it is going to take people understanding what it is to be adopted main stream. I'm too young to have been around when credit cards were introduced, but I can imagine the same thing was happening when they first introduce credit cards.
"Why would I go thru the trouble of filling out an application, waiting 2-4 weeks for a card in the mail to buy something I can just pay for with cash today?"
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:25:07
Yes, but I see it getting easier for your average person to get bitcoin. Also your analogy is like me saying, once I got my coinbase account verified and setup I can purchase items online and brick and mortar stores....

No plugins, newest Firefox, tell me how my computer gets infected? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:16:29
No offense taken.  I knew ghash.io had a pretty big share already when I started there. I have only tried 2 other pools. This one seems to give me payouts more often and less hassle with my miners ie I rarely find the pool down. I am not sure what the negative to ghash is, other than their size. I still have to research these accusations since no reference materials were given in this post. For me to move right now I would have to cease trading on their platform. Probably if they start charging trading fees would make me leave.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:04:58
"The Reserve Bank of India, on Tuesday, warned the public against the use of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, pointing out that users expose themselves to potential financial, legal and security related risks."
Isn't that true with any currency?
@_date: 2013-10-21 03:40:02
They will say LocalBitcoins.com traders are money exchangers and by law must follow fecn rules and regulations like any other money exchange does. This would effectively shut down the site. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:14:35
I have my miners pointed at ghash. I can move them anytime. Are you talking about their exchange?
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:46:26
Well then don't POST on christmas jesus. Also thanks for replying to me and the many other people who have nothing to say. Why not instead of paying attention to us, pay attention to the people asking real questions. You see I am not adding anything to your post, on the other hand there are many good questions and discussions happening here that you have obviously choosen to ignore because..... your a dick.

Bitcoin has no apr. Credit cards and the like have upto 29.99% interest. I don't like being in debit and I think our population of young college grads with shit loads of debt don't want to pay even more interest on purchasing goods.

What do you think will happen once all the Bitcoin are mined?

No they are not caught up.

I was just making the assumption based on ops original post that he doesn't have a "browser full of plugins". Maybe you want to help out and list some plug-ins that are known to have to problems like this, because as far as I know, there is always an injection point, but unless it is a specific hack you still have to open a program or file with the infected code. Give me some links please.

if someone doesnt have the level of thinking to educate themselves and play it safe while getting to know the system then they kind of have whatever happens to them coming. this is an investment, people should treat it as such. nobody should be required to hold someone elses hand if they are going to jump off a cliff without looking first.

You cannot have the option to cancel. Why would they do that? 
Say I had purchased 1 btc for 1k and 5 hrs later it is at 950, everyone would be canceling their orders and buying back in at a lower price.

Seriously your a dick.

I think there is plenty of room for a coinbase competitor. Just take their business model and add support and notice other mistakes they made, someone could make a lot of money.

Mt.Gox has really high volumes for BTC, but difficult to get USD out. I would move BTC to gox -&gt; trade -&gt;move more BTC out of gox -&gt;localbitcoins to cash out.

Any new company will have some hiccups. I was caught in the automated "high risk" thingy they had, and I contacted them and they apologized and whitelisted me. They are probably pretty busy over there right now with all the new customers they are gaining everyday.
