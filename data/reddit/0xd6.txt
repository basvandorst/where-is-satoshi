I've also put in a complaint with ICANN for incorrect / falsified whois information - which should be passed through to their registrar.

At the moment, the price on LBC seems pretty harsh - at least, when I last looked a few days ago. My guess is people trying to re-coup costs or attempting to take advantage of people trying to "buy-in" while the price is low.
 However, there's no chance in hell I'd pay $300+ above spot price (Coinjar).

I agree. I was surprised when I got the call. I hit submit, the payment provider bounced back with a "contact your bank" message, and within TWO MINUTES NAB card security were on the phone.
 After all of that, I'm considering moving everything over to NAB, as they seem to be on the ball.

I'd recommend this also. I've made a large number of CBA BTC transactions via LBC and never had an issue.
 As for the issue you saw, was it a fraud prevention measure? I attempted to buy some BTC via NAB and I had someone on the phone in minutes saying that they'd blocked the transaction and wanted to confirm it was legitimate before I could try again.

Agreed. As mentioned in another thread, I got a call from card security from my bank when attempting to use CoinBase to buy BTC.
 They were good about it and allowed me to whitelist it, but I've never had that occur with ANY other online purchases before... Even from dodgy looking merchants in Hong Kong and the like.
