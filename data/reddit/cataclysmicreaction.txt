Strictly speaking the left/right isn't largely connected to this, 
But the more radical left in the internet age, seem to be increasingly freedom/liberty focused, (libertarian socialism) is the largest specific ideology politics subreddit If i recall correctly.
Now I'll try not to preach ideas that I'm supportive of, so ill keep this bit as brief as possible, One of the things anarchists seem to generally dislike is having homeless people on the streets surrounded by empty buildings that could easily serve as homes.  
Anarchists, not having much respect for the law frequently advocate that the homeless simply move into to these abandoned buildings. This is called "Squatting" 
buildings that are occupied in such a manner are referred to as "squats"
Here the guardian has a interview with the 
["people behind bitcoin"](
 for some reason i cant get the video to load today. But if i recall the video correctly it show the creators of bitcoin as young people coding off of laptops in a Office squat with [Anarchist]( and [Squatter Symbols]( Spray painted on the walls 
This had led to view bit coin as currency created by a rag-tag group of crypto-anarchists  with the goal of snatching power from the ruling elites  for the lower classes, although they still have a problem with currency at large the seem to prefer bitcoin over a central bank any day.
Oh god, wall of text, hopefully it answers your question
