If we had gone to war with the architects of 9/11 instead of slaughtering innocents and creating ISIS in the aftermath of that, there would be a smoking, glowing hole where Saudi Arabia used to be.

Wall Street is a casino. You will do better at the track if you know how to handicap.

There are none, as the bitcoin community values anonymity so much. We don't even know who Satoshi Nakamoto really was, other than not Dorian Nakamoto.

This will get downvoted, but a dogecoin will never be worth much. Bitcoins come in blocks of 25. Litecoins come it blocks of 50. Dogecoins come in blocks of 5000. There are too many of them. They are like the German Mark after WW1, or the Zimbabwe Dollar.

Anyone who sent coins to a place called ponzicoin has serious mental deficiencies, and needs to be institutionalized. To help make that happen, please donate bitcoin, litecoin or dogecoin to these addresses:

Mt. Gox is deliberately not fixing their bugs because there will be a run on them as soon as they re-open for withdrawals, and then they will be broke. For the overall health of bitcoin though, they need to go away.

Hoarding it will ruin it as a currency. It has to stay in circulation to stay valuable.

If Mt. Gox will fix their glitches and get back online, the value of virtual currency will stop tanking.

Whey causes inflammation in sensitive people. Having it every day will cause chronic inflammation, which is the real cause of type 2 diabetes and a host of other ailments.

I recommend mining for alt like litecoin, then converting at an exchange.

If i could take even the most obsolete mining hardware back to 2010, i would be retired by 2013.

This smells like a trick to get investors in a vaporware product that will never materialize. What is there other than a graphics card that I can walk into a store and buy today, or have shipped to me in under a week that will effectively mine? Anything?

Brandine University and The Helvetica Institute for Science and Technology both have addresses for bitcoin and litecoin donation.

It is your own stupid fault for admitting to a bank that you are using a currency they don't control. You should have written down goods sold or services rendered. Think of Bitcoin like fight club.
