Cavirtex always has a horrible  exchange rate though.

I don't disagree that it's slow, I'm just suggesting that might be part of the reason why.

Mobile Apps like [Bitcoin Wallet for Android]( can use direct connection methods like bluetooth to verify the transaction almost instantly. That's why [said someone "is doing this wrong".

I too am in the middle of dealing with TigerDirect.ca customer service regarding a bitcoin order myself. 
I ordered this [Seagate SSD]( on 7/26 using bitcoin.  
On 8/2 and 8/8 I received back-order notifications. No problem, I wasn't in a rush.
On 8/14 I received a notice that they canceled my order. Here's where the real problems start. On the ToC/FAQ, they write:






So TigerDirect was now unwiling to either deliver the product I had ordered or return my money. I called their Phone Support on 8/12 and asked for a refund of any sort other than a Gift Card; I don't care if it's BTC, Cash, Cheque, Money Order, etc. I had no interest in buying any other products from them. The Customer Service Rep told me that they would submit a request for the GC to be converted to a refund in CDN and they would get back to me within 48 hours. I never heard back. So I called again today (8/29). Their resolution now is that, somehow magically, they can re-submit the order and deliver the product I ordered, so the CSR is going to try to do that. She promised they will get back to me. I'm not holding my breath. 
So it's been a month since I parted with my BTC and, through no fault of my own, I yet to have anything to show for it. So buyers beware.

There is certainly deals to be had in Ontario, but there are still plenty of "high-end" options that will cost an arm and a leg.

That makes way more sense

Wow, checkmate Bernie!

Sorry, old habits die hard. Please go ahead and provide some alternative links if you'd like.

Looks like about 10BTC in the last 48 hours alone. 
Edit: 20BTC now!

Sorry to break it to you, but you could have turned that $500 into $25000. Thought I should point that out. Cheers.

That's why there are "[Dark Pools]( though I don't know how big these pools are.

Trying it out myself. It took about 6 hours for my interac payment to be deposited, though to be fair I started the transaction around midnight. Too bad for me, because by the time my funds were deposited the market price for BTC had doubled. Missed that boat. Lesson Learned here; if you're itching over whether or not to pull the trigger, don't wait until the last minute to sign up and deposit your funds.

That might be due to laws around coverting currency. Taking Bitcoin and returning fiat in exchange would require them to operate under stricter regulations, like ones for banks. Also opens the door to things like money laundering.

Cash flow is a common problem for small businesses. Not just due to scammers, but even honest customers who sometimes takes 60 - 90 days to pay an invoice can really strain a company who needs to pay their employees every 2 weeks and distributors within 30 days. That's why the credit crisis has hurt small businesses more than any other - you might need a line of credit to operate while you wait for your 'receivables' to come in, even if you are having great sales numbers. Talk to a bank or lender, show them your sales numbers and outstanding orders, and see if you can't secure a small line of credit to keep you operating when you hit bumps in the road like this.

That's funny, so do I!

Unless they just store all the encrypted traffic until they get a copy of your private key, then go back in time and view all your prior communications.

Their plan of attack against strong crypto is: massive data centres. Keep all the encrypted traffic in storage until decrypting it is easier (e.g. they compromise the client or the server and obtain the private keys).
