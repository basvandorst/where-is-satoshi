Some credit to u/qwerty4ever for getting me started in the right direction, I've learned a lot about Linux on this adventure!
Do this at your own risk! I'm very new to bitcoin mining, this is my first miner, an Antminer S9 14TH/s version, and I was getting very annoyed with the fans constantly going up and down, hours of research led me to the following solution. You will need to download Putty and ssh to the IP of your miner. Once there log in using root as the username and the password you've set up, I believe the default is also root. Once you're logged in you are now at a Linux prompt, with access to the file system inside your miner. Use the following steps to set the fan speed manually.
* Navigate to the folder with your config file, type:
cd /config
* We need to make the bmminer.conf file not read only, type:
chmod 755 bmminer.conf
* Enter the vi file editor, type:
vi bmminer.conf
You are now in the vi editor, you should see the entire contents of the bmminer.conf file on your screen, expand the window if you need to. For instructions on using the Vi editor please see the great write-up at the link below. Note you can't change the file until you write it, so don't worry about keystrokes or messing up, just don't write until you're done!
* You need too add the following two lines above the line that reads "bitmain-use-vil":
* **"bitmain-fan-ctrl" : true,**
* **"bitmain-fan-pwm" : "100",**
To do this move the cursor down with the arrow keys, navigate to the begining of the line that reads "bitmain-use-vil", click i, this puts you in edit mode, hit enter to add a blank line, click up to position your cursor in the blank line you just created, copy the above two lines, right click to paste them into the config file. 
Your config file should now look like the following image.
With the number being the percentage you'd like the fans to run at. NOTICE I do not know what will happen if you overheat your Antminer, I believe there are automatic shutdown protections, but do this at your own risk! I HIGHLY SUGGEST setting this number to 100 to start and lowering it until you find the right spot, I'm told the cutoff temp for the S9 is 115C, and up to 100C is alright, I've been trying to keep mine around 80C though. You can monitor the temps from your web browser at  and putty into it at the same time, watch the temps and make changes, use the reboot feature in the gui/browser to make the changes apply. Notice the S9 appears to take 5-10min to come online.
Now write the file and exit vi by typing:
You can view the file to make sure the changes took by typing: 
vi bmminer.conf
If it looks good exit by typing:
You'll need to restart the miner for the change to take effect, you can do this via the gui/browser. If your miner will possibly overheat type 'poweroff' from your ssh connection and give it a few minutes before restarting.
Donations welcome

Thanks for the reply, as I said I'm a noob when it comes to Linux, so I just stepped out what worked for me. Interesting, I was reading 80 was as high as you wanted to go but maybe that was with the L3+, that makes me feel a little better as I was trying to figure out how I was going to keep this thing cool during summer!
