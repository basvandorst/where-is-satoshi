The true btc Jesus 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:25:44
Andreas Antonopoulos, a phrase synonymous to Jesus H Christ! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:43:25
Sounds promising

"Those who would give up essential Bitcoin, to purchase a little temporary Ripple, deserve neither Bitcoin nor Ripple." - Benjamin J Franklin
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:35:52
Ya that's definitely a more accurate statement. The gross generalization is just to simplify things for my friends who have no knowledge of crypto
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:00:29
How could anyone think Andreas is evil? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:05:38
That would be incredible

Need exchanges to actually use segwit, need core to release a segwit gui wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:27
How about instead of typing Jesus Christ, we type Andreas Antonopoulos.
 Can this be our thing everytime we hit a milestone? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:08:13
What's happening 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:51:04
He calls the big MMA fights, used to host Fear Factor. He has one of the most listened to podcasts in the millions where he interviews people from all walks of life. Andreas has been on 3 times and each has resulted in fantastic conversation.

Let's make it happen! And it auto donates to him whenever you mistakenly type Jesus Christ instead of the true prophet's name. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:54:51
Haha good stuff. Take donations? What's your public address? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:31:37
Agreed, nothing has changed other than the fact that an attack was engineered by bcash today

Here's mine I wrote for my crypto muggle friends:
Many of you may have heard of the insane run up of bitcoin, which as of today is at 16k USD. For perspective, it was at 9k only a week ago.
As someone who's been balls deep in the cryptocurrency space, I thought it would be important to talk about what will likely occur in the next 2 weeks and how you interpret it.
On Monday, Wall Street will officially trade bitcoin. Such rapid increases usually mean a lack of stability, something likely to be exploited. There is a strong belief that Wall Street will attempt to crash the price by selling and betting against bitcoin, in order to accumulate vast quantities at lower prices, knowing full well that the price will boom in the long term. A drop of 30 to 40% is very possible, say from 16k to 10k USD, and the mass media will yet again proclaim bitcoin dead. They'll say it was just a ponzi scheme,  just imaginary internet money.
Do not believe this campaign of fear.
Take this into account. Bitcoin was valued at under $1000 USD a year ago. It has experienced over a 1500% increase since then. In the long term, bitcoin and the tech behind it is just getting started. It's possible that Bitcoin might not exist in 10 years. It might die or be overtaken. However, blockchain, the technology behind it, will undoubtedly survive to impact almost every facet of our lives as can it be adapted to near infinite use cases. IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, major banks, Visa, governments are all researching how to integrate the tech. So adoption seems inevitable. Even if you don't care to invest, it would immensely valuable to just to be aware and informed of this technology.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:46
Andreas fucking Antonopoulos. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:03:01
Lucky buggers with the bitcoin at 13000
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:38:44
Yes, if you believe this theory. I've been hearing a lot of of talk from people who interact with CME traders. They say they have been planning to short for a while. So if you believe this, convert to fiat (but risk paying taxes) or go into an alt you think can out trade btc in the short term. Then move back to btc if/when it dips. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:23:53
Suck it Ver. How many people would be willing to donate to that jerk? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:19:00
If every exchange used segwit there wouldn't be any unprocessed fees. Core is releasing a gui segwit wallet soon. Should alleviate 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:36:42
Suck bcash indeed 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:08:58
