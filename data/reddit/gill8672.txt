I’ve actually thought about it on more then one occasion 
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:33:32
I don't know about most people, but I don't remember details about stuff when I was 12. Haha

Yeah, I was a smart 12 year old kid that made money out of nothing as I acted. Then sold it all when it jumped over $10 and had candy for days

All as in all the money I still had 
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:50:10
Literally made like $700 on it and spent it ALL on candy. I was the candy man at school , gave it away like....candy
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:01:15
Candy was yum

Oh yeah, I'm totally fine with the way it went down! 
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:16:05
Yeah, this was years ago so might of been less and just felt like more at the time 
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:00:21
2011,2012. Somewhere in that range. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:32:55
Yeah that's basically what I did. I can't even remember exact figures. But I know it was an unreal amount for a 12 year old , and a rather poor family too. I do remember some of my money going to my mom for help with a bill, but she was great and didn't touch a lot of it even though she was behind on everything. Wasn't smart enough at the time to realize how much it would of helped her haha

Definitely ! If I could go back, I'd hold of course. But being 12 and seeing an amount that I've never even fathomed made it impossible not to sell. AND I sold right when it first broke 10 and then went back down. 
So it was a smart decision with the information I had at hand.

I️ sold when it hit $1 roughly in March of 2011. I️ was ecstatic to have over a thousand dollars, being pretty young at the time...
