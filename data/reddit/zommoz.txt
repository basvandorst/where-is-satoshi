I don't understand what's going on here. I'm not well versed in BFL, but isn't their product $600, and only pumps out .8GHash, not 3.5?

Sending address now.

Yeah, I've def found my new way to acquire BTC, unless I can find a buyer that accepts Amazon Payments.
@_date: 2012-08-08 22:05:48
Will send as a gift so no charge-backs possible. But with my reputation I would need to be sent the BTC first, unless you have a more established reputation.

I have about $25 right now, but that will continue to climb. It'll be $50-$70 by the end of the weekend. How much can you accommodate? And at what rate? You can PM if you don't feel comfortable posting in public.
@_date: 2012-07-07 07:25:44
Nope, no fees. I'm not positive with credit cards, but I don't use that aspect as it is. You can check it out yourself if you are looking to replace other online payment services. I just use it for mturk. By the way, great service. It's really helping me get off the ground with cash while I'm out of work. I've racked up like $65 this week just doing it every now and again while I use Reddit/watch movies.
And that time might be rubbing against something I have to do, but I'll try and finish before then.

We can only hope that Bitcoin has this affect on many others. It's time to wake up.

He's selling them for $300 each. You can buy them for $150, or $75 in bulk. I suggest that *you* run those numbers again.
@_date: 2012-06-28 22:45:44
I appreciate it, but this is time-sensitive. I'm only asking for like 6 cents here.
@_date: 2012-07-07 15:46:15
There's really no reason at all to use PayPal to just send funds. AP is superior in every facet. Now if only eBay would loosen their grip on their monopolized payments...*yeah right.*
@_date: 2012-08-08 22:35:26
No fees when sent as a gift.
@_date: 2012-07-16 22:29:31
Gotcha, so he's just preying on the stupid.
@_date: 2012-08-09 00:08:24
If you send them your receipt and a message, I'm sure you'll get it. They can easily track deposits.
@_date: 2012-08-09 00:31:06
They're not in the business of stealing people's money. Some bad press can ruin a company like this. Most people will go out of their way to help out their customers.
@_date: 2012-07-15 12:10:45
Oh, I know. I just hope that the information spreads out to others, as fast as possible.
@_date: 2012-07-07 07:25:52
Well I stand corrected.
@_date: 2012-07-07 07:13:52
Yeah, I co-host the new show that's on the banner in I'm pretty new, but as you can tell, fairly active. Are you thinking market rate? I'm not even sure if you can chargeback with AP, too. Also, what time are you thinking? I'm free all day, but just want to know when to expect.
@_date: 2013-03-16 19:44:21
Why do you assume that if not for taxation, these things would not get done? Where do you base this assumption? It's not facts or evidence, I'll tell you that. If you demand a product or service, someone will provide it for you...econ101.

If everyone else wants you to kill yourself, should you kill yourself?
Where did the group derive the right to dictate how the individual should live?

[Common objection which is so easily addressed that I'll just link you to Google.](


So because it's morally unsustainable, it makes it okay to commit widespread theft?
@_date: 2013-03-16 19:05:56


I'm not sure I know what that is.


Elaborate on that. Where is the line drawn? Who draws the lines? How do you make sure that no one is corrupting those supposed checks and balances? How do you keep people who intend harm or manipulation out of the system?


I don't accept that at all. And I don't want to pay anything I didn't agree to pay.


You're funny.
@_date: 2013-03-16 20:22:45


What? Yes they do...but that's not even the point. Things wouldn't cost the same in a market absent taxation, and the world would look very different.


If no one wants to make it, it shouldn't be done. Simple as that. And really, free riders? What a load of shit.


Why do you keep assuming, in a free market, that it would be a monopoly? Why does that even make any kind of sense? You obviously do not have an economics degree, because you would have learned this would not be the case in your first macro course. A plurality of local and regional companies would arise to maintain these roads.


What a solid argument.
