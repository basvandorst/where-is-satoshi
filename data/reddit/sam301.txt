I called up Capital One. They didn't know why it was reversed and suggested that I try again. (Make sure to cancel the original deposit request on Bit Floor first.)

I actually send 2 transactions within 30 minutes of each other. The 1st one went through after 3 days. The 2nd one was reversed 2 days after that.

Have the same issue, sent P2P same day as you. I actually sent two transfers on that day. The first one went through on Thursday. Haven't heard back from support yet.

The amounts were quite different. It is all quite interesting and reflective of how much of a hassle moving around our money is.

blockchain.info users: When it comes online again, make sure to install the "My Wallet Verifier" extension that verifies the javascript. It's an easy way to add security.

Yes, it is a valuable service on which many have become dependent. It would take a while for the clones to gain acceptance out of security and reliability concerns, but I look forward to seeing them come online.

This is vastly preferable to having huge delays and spreads that enable panic decisions.

"Bitcoin buyer would’ve had to shell out around 1,000 units of the virtual currency"
$1M USD seems like a bad deal to me.

If going to Target is an option, you can buy their gift cards from Gyft.

Bravo, audenx, and thanks.

Nope, P2P payment via checking account. I've heard of shady merchants offering CC payment methods, but have steered clear for the obvious reasons.

The transfer never completed on Bitfloor's end. Roman (owner/operator) responded to my inquiry with the standard 'be patient' reply and did not look into the issue, otherwise he would have seen the problem.

How do you handle transaction fees?
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:35:53
Cancelled the deposit on the bitfloor side. Even if they would correct the reveresal, it would be another 3-4 business days before it would be credited to my account.(!)
