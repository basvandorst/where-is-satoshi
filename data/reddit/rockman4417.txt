Yeah it's definitely a good portion of luck.  That's why most people will tell you not to bother with day trading because you need an effective strategy that works over 50% of the time and you need to adhere to it strictly regardless of what your emotions are telling you.  Otherwise the whales will eat you alive
Most people don't have that kind of fortitude and are better of hodling.  I don't know if it's accurate but I read many people say 90% of day traders fail.  But if you're set on doing it my advice would be to research as much as you can, realize it takes a long time to master and that even the best traders fail a good portion of the time.  
You'll hit walls and you'll get discouraged, and your ability to ride through them will determine if you're the 10% that succeed or not.  And you should really hone an effective strategy before trading with any real money.  Use fake money at first and take your emotions out of it completely

You have to realize you are part of an ecosystem filled with much more savvy and wealthy investors that thrive off inexperienced people like you who panic buy and sell.  They have much more leverage than you will ever have and their only objective is to take as much money and coin from you as possible.  
In the market you do not represent "you" alone.  You represent a certain mindset held by thousands of other traders.  And when you are panic selling so are they.  That's exactly the queue the whales wait for in order to pump the price again.  And the inverse when you are panic buying.

That's the problem it does have clout.  You don't realize there are thousands of other inexperienced traders thinking the same exact thing that you are in that moment, seeing the same visual queues.  
The best traders already sold off before the dip even started

Just a sign that correction is incoming when you see these appeals to the masses

"where in the fall"  Here's your problem.  Sell in the green, buy in the red if you're going to trade.  If that's too much stress then you buy and hodl, or don't bother with crypto

I would say with anything investing it's important to scale.  If you sold your entire pot for a loss and the price went up you'd be in pretty bad shape.  "But wait" you say, "I'll just buy back in now that the price is going back up."  Well congrats you just FOMO'd and the price is going back down again.  "Oh I'll just sell at a loss and buy back cheaper."  Too bad, price is going up and you now have less coins than if you just HODL in the first place
Crypto isn't the stock market, those same strategies work much different in a highly volatile market like this.  And probably not the best advice to be telling new investors to sell their bags at a loss, only to try to catch a falling knife.  Gonna lose people a lot of money
