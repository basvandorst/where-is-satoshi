You've got that pretty wrong. demand is buying interest supply is selling interest. fiat holders are potential demand, crypto holders are potential supply. 
What do you think is the average cost per bitcoin across all holders?
Do you think the current price is above or below that?
Do you think there is enough buying/ selling interest to change that average price so that it is above/ below the current price?

Everything on this chart consistently precedes bull runs according to you.

my estimate for the high is 15330 i don't think it will go to 15500. I don't trade btc but it's been valuable in my learning, i follow bitstamp on tradingview btc/usd. I can't quite remember but i think a little over 4k was my downmove target. not a straight line though, more bounces.

The point is the demand is to low to allow for the people holding to sell. 
If you're interested, the correction is about to reach it's high. Just saying.

I'll give you a lesson on bubbles.
In a market you have buyers and sellers. If buyers exceeds sellers at any point price rises. If you buy an asset eventually you must sell it - in the case of bitcoin I might say I'm selling it for goods/services.
So what happens when the buyers don't sell? You cut down the supply. Less sellers means less buyers needed to push up the price. Eventually buyers run out, why? because those who are holding don't have the assets to buy, and new buyers dry up.
So what you're left with is little demand and a huge amount supply held by those who refused to sell.
It's the the 'hodl' mentality which built your own grave.
Do you think there's enough demand, money to buy all the bitcoins from all the holders at 20k? Who'd give up their money for that?

Why not? if that's how long it takes for somebody, then they can enjoy all the gains after that. There's no guarantee the down move is over. Price is very volatile right now and there's no reason to risk getting trapped.

but the bubbles bursting
low volume does not mean down.
ofc that's just my speculation.

If the price is low that's a larger % of the total supply of bitcoin. 50$ is more demand when prices are low. Basic economics: price down demand up.

in thousands of usd i think those will be the key swing points from right now. thats the path I think it will take. Low trading volume does not effect price movements just slower movement, maybe more zigzags. 
Volume is accumulative - by which i mean this - if 100 people buy and hold at 1k and 100 people buy and hold at 10k you have 200 people holding. As long as more people who want to buy and hold than people who want to sell price goes up. 
so you can have say 100k people buying and holding and price will go up so long and there are 2 buyers and 1 seller. those buying and holding can't buy more (unless the sink more assets) so buyers dwindle and then some people sell and suddenly theres no demand for everything held by the holders. that's a bubble bursting.

If my shit reaches half of gold's market cap in 5 years (assuming that 90% of it is flushed) we're looking at $420k a turd. The current price is $3.50 (any buyers?).

I'm just going to say that this subreddit has an extreme case of groupthink. I think it's so bad it can feel malicious in nature. So maybe you shouldn't go around banning people.

I to plan on adopting a currency which rewards early adopters at the cost of late adopters.
inflation occurs because new technology is more valuable than old. a farmer today has more output than the farmer yesterday, the work/time of todays is more valuable. how could you devalue the work of yesterdays farmer? quantitative easing perhaps?
what about if it's in the form of a deflationary asset?

I think now is the time to buy , or hodl expecting about 14k before the bear market continues... to below 6k
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:01:49
what do you even think a bubble is?
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:23:09
just copy pasting from wikipedia.
'In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time'
Thats the page on inflation.
'The general price level is a hypothetical daily measure of overall prices for some set of goods and services (the consumer basket), in an economy or monetary union during a given interval (generally one day), normalized relative to some base set.'
that's the page on price level.
so I think that if todays goods are more valuable than yesterdays they should have a greater price level, which meets the criteria for inflation.

Study is trash.
 "Technical analysis is not consistently profitable in the 49 countries that comprise the Morgan
Stanley Capital Index once data snooping bias is accounted for. "
Lets rewrite: " Technical analysis is not consistently profitable once you remove the few competent analysts from the data. I set out  show 500+ super basic ideas don't provide an edge in isolation"
Second reads: " People generally fail at producing profits with TA"
This is true, but doesn't mean it makes for bad investing, that's only one possible explanation for the data.
