They can, by centralizing the network. The BCH devs themselves have admitted that on-chain scaling will necessarily lead to greater centralization than is present on Bitcoin.


This sounds like an argument in favor of keeping the base layer maximally-decentralized, which is the opposite of what BCH is doing.


I don't think many people believe LN will actually decrease centralization. It'll naturally be a bit more centralized than the base network, since liquidity providers can decide who they open channels with, and will likely be bound by KYC/AML as a result. If we're lucky, it'll naturally transform into a mesh network which becomes a nightmare to regulate, but I'm not convinced that is likely.
But LN *will* incentivize off-chain transactions for those that are able to make them, while making on-chain transactions cheaper for everyone else.
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:32:20
Yeah, and that's acceptable for a lot of people. Those who want to avoid counterparty risk can just avoid using that particular solution... You can always fallback to the maximally-decentralized base later, it's just going to be more expensive to transact there since it is more expensive to secure those transactions.
Fundamentally, you can easily build centralized layers on top of a decentralized platform, but it's impossible to build decentralized layers on top of a centralized platform. This is why a lot of people feel that changes which potentially increase centralization of the core protocol must be avoided at all costs.

Decentralization implies the system can't be shutdown by a single entity (or minority of entities). If you build a decentralized system on top of a centralized platform, then the platform itself can simply be shutdown by its owner or someone who is able to coerce its owner.
Now, this is interesting because the entities which comprise a decentralized system are themselves naturally centralized -- for example, computers which run Bitcoin node software can be shutdown by their owner, a SWAT team, the power company, your cat, etc. It is only once you have *many* of these centralized homogenous platforms with diverse ownership that building a decentralized system on top of them becomes possible.

You will still need to pay fees, as you are consuming liquidity in any channels your payment passes through on the way to the recipient. Unlike on-chain transactions, where the fee is independent of the value, lightning fees will increase with the value of the transaction.

The most attractive property to most people is that it has a fixed supply, unlike fiat currencies (which are inflationary for the most part). In fact at some point (likely already), Bitcoin becomes *deflationary* since the rate of coin loss, due to loss of the controlling private key, will exceed the rate of issuance. But in the long term, as people get better at safeguarding private keys, we can expect the coin supply to remain relatively constant and have minimal impact on the value of Bitcoin.
What does this mean? Simply holding onto Bitcoin won't cause it to decrease in value as dollars do today, so it can be looked at as a store of value, similar to gold (the supply of which also inflates at a rate slower than fiat currencies). But it also has several advantages over gold: you can send it anywhere in the world in an hour, to anyone, without asking anyone's permission. It is easier and cheaper to store securely. It can't be counterfeited.
Now of course, there remains some debate over whether the store of value use case *on its own* is sufficient, as Bitcoin of course has no intrinsic value to fall back on during an economic crisis -- whereas gold has some basic utility in fashion and electronics, for example. This utility does not contribute to a significant portion of gold's price today, but some believe this utility is necessary in order for anything to serve as a stable store of value. Some others would argue that Bitcoin's utility as a means of exchange and immutable ledger *does* give it intrinsic value -- it is the only way to transfer ownership of something across the globe in a permissionless way, and that ability provides intrinsic value to the system. In a more general sense, it can be seen a globally-accessible database where anyone can store anything and it will remain for all of eternity, regardless of who wants to shut it down. This tech didn't exist before and is tremendously useful across a wide range of industries.
Finally, one of the most hotly-debated topics is Bitcoin's utility as a currency for day-to-day transactions, like buying coffee. Since it was proposed as peer-to-peer electronic *cash*, many want Bitcoin to be usable in all of the same ways cash is today, including point-of-sale purchases. This requires transactions to be cheap (no or negligible fees) and fast (seconds). In the early days, Bitcoin was both of these, today it is neither, and the issue is scaling the system in a way that maintains decentralization. It may be possible that there is no way to scale Bitcoin to thousands of transactions per second while maintaining its current level of decentralization and censorship-resistance; or rather, it may only be able to scale as quickly as advances in computing, which is far slower than the rate at which demand is growing right now. So, other currencies have emerged which trade some amount decentralization for lower fees. Bitcoin has chosen to preserve decentralization at all costs, since that is the property that makes it unique from everything else, and it is one of the few cryptocurrencies which have taken a hard stance on this, which is where a lot of my confidence comes from.
So, why would people be willing to reintroduce counterparty risk? Well, if it turns out people actually do want to spend Bitcoin like cash (in the future once its value stabilizes), the simplest way to support all of the use cases of cash today is to build them as layers *on top of* Bitcoin. An extreme example would be: everything works as it does today, but instead of transacting in USD, you transact in BTC with your credit/debit card, and the settlement networks between banks and creditors use large transactions on the Bitcoin network instead of SWIFT and clearing houses. Everything above the settlement network is identical, and the only property of BTC that is preserved to the consumer's benefit would be its fixed supply. But of course, in reality we'll likely see more disruptive changes in the layers between the Bitcoin network and the user which will allow preservation of other properties; Lightning Network is one such proposal.

The difference is that a central authority can't simply decide that your certificates are no longer backed by Bitcoin. You will always be able to claim your Bitcoin (on-chain) by closing the channel. This ensures that the supply remains fixed as well as liquid.
Meanwhile you retain the other benefits of cryptocurrency -- fast, cheap, international, censorship-resistant transactions.

Millibit isn't bad, but then you're already removing "coin" so it doesn't really make sense... and it's probably still too large of a unit to be practical if the price is going to rise any further.
"Microbit" takes more effort to enunciate, so I think it would be shortened to "micros" in practice, which might be fine, but you're then omitting all of "Bitcoin" which could be confusing outside of the context of currency. "Dollars" and "bits" both roll off the tongue a lot more easily.

I tried it today with Eclair on Android. Didn't have much success.
1. Obtaining testnet coins was not problematic, though there doesn't seem be any documentation (I had to know to use the faucet). Shouldn't be an issue on mainnet though, or at least not a new issue.
2. Opening a channel - I used the "auto-connect" option, which connects to the endurance.acinq.co node. This went fine, though slightly irritating that block time was 20 minutes on testnet when doing so (2 confs requried to open the channel).
3. Buying a Blockachino - didn't work. When attempting to pay, I get a "RouteNotFound" error. Is there really no route between Starblocks and the default node for auto-connect?
4. Trying again this evening, I see that the channel I opened is "offline". Cool, so now those funds are just tied up until the node comes back online or I close the channel, meanwhile I've paid 2x on-chain fees and made no useful transactions?
Seems like a lot of good progress has been made, but this just served to remind me how far away we could be from real adoption :(
Edit: a few hours later, the channel is appearing online again, but I'm still getting RouteNotFound trying to pay.

I don't think this is realistic, as it basically requires BTC to replace fiat as a unit of account. That is simply not going to happen any time soon, and if the scaling problems are not resolved first, it will never happen.


It's also solved by literally every other cryptocurrency. As soon as one comes along that offers better utility (e.g. scaling, a non-terrible UX, widespread merchant adoption), Bitcoin will be strictly inferior, i.e. obsolete.
That being said, I still think there's a good chance Bitcoin will scale first. But failing that, I don't think it has a future as solely a store of value.

Thanks, now I have more questions though!
First, the article seems to be discussing deflation resulting from an economic recession, in which people pull their money from the stock market out of fear. In this case there is already a systemic issue; are there examples of the economic impact of a currency that is deflationary by design? I would expect people to still invest in such an economy, since investments would offer better return than holding currency.


Couldn't you also say "Why would I spend a dollar today when I can put it in the stock market and buy effectively more stuff next year?" And I'd think the answer in both cases would be "Because the good/service I'm interested buying is worth paying for right now instead of later". This is obviously the case for necessities like food and shelter, but I'm not understanding why it couldn't apply to other goods and services.

If it crashes to 10k while BCH goes to 11k, that's catastrophic IMO.
Keep in mind, the only way on-chain scaling can be disproven is by actually achieving that level of scale and seeing how the system holds up (and how centralized it becomes). Until then, people look at BCH and see low fees + growing merchant adoption. By the time big blocks actually become a bottleneck, we will be long past the flippening. At that point, BCH gets to solve the problem (they could copy-paste segwit and lightning) or another altcoin will rise. I don't see people flooding back into Bitcoin once it losses critical mass.

Okay, but that's one guy, and he's a full-time investor. He spends his entire life researching potential investments, and has seen better returns as a result.
Most people investing in Bitcoin are not full-time investors. They have other investments, and simply don't have enough time in their lives to gain a fundamental understanding of the tech behind each. They understand the general concept and see that it could be big, and that's enough for them.
Honestly, do you feel the people who understand Bitcoin at the deepest technical level are also the ones with the best foresight about where the market is headed? I personally don't, as these people are inherently biased toward BTC which clouds their judgment of the financial market as a whole, and there are a lot more factors at play than just the tech.

I both agree and disagree, depending on your definition of gambling.
If by gambling you mean that people are throwing in money with no _guarantee_ that they'll see profit, then it's obviously gambling. But then, by this definition, _all_ investing is gambling, just with varying levels of risk.
If by gambling you mean that people are throwing in money and hoping to profit with no reasoning to _suggest_ that they will, I don't think this is the case with most Bitcoin investors. I think most see the potential in decentralized currency, and expect it to grow as a result (i.e. they're speculating).

I agree CDs aren't worth it right now, but they serve a very different purpose. When you put money in a CD you still have immediate access to it, you just sacrifice the interest if you pull it out. It's basically a savings account with tighter restrictions and a slightly higher interest rate as a result.
In contrast, in order to liquidate crypto you need to convert it to fiat. Not only does this take longer than withdrawing from a CD, but depending on where the market is that day you also stand to lose a significant amount of its value.

Right, but without forking, those clients basically need to follow all of the same rules as the core client, so there is little incentive to do so. While it's true that controlling the code for the most popular client is not important, controlling the protocol rules followed by the majority of miners _is important_, and Core accomplishes the latter as a result of the former.
Regarding Core itself not being centralized, what do you mean? It is a small number of individuals controlling what code goes into the core client. Saying "you don't need to use the Core client" doesn't change the fact that this group is centralized.


Leaders are essential to getting things done. A leader-less ownership model would look more along the lines of: anyone can commit to the Bitcoin repo, but each commit requires hashrate consensus before it is merged. This is not sustainable, nor is it necessarily desirable (e.g. it empowers miners above all other stakeholders). So instead, a few people act as the gatekeepers to the core repo, and these leaders can be "overthrown" by miners/users switching to a client which uses a different set of rules. If the majority of value follows this forked chain, it becomes Bitcoin.
I think the important distinction here is: proof of work (i.e. what makes Bitcoin secure) is decentralized, while the rules of the Bitcoin protocol are more democratic/political. Yes anyone can make up their own rules, but convincing others to follow your rules is very difficult as most miners will continue using the incumbent client by default.

Again, **most** people do not consider the risk of civil forfeiture to be high enough to bother with managing their own cash (or tomorrow, crypto). Bitcoin makes it *easier and safer* to manage your own cash in many ways, but there is still substantial risk and you really need to know what you're doing. For this reason, I believe most people will not hold their life savings behind a private key in their possession, just like most people do not keep their fiat savings in cash.
Bitcoin was invented to avoid government *control* of money. Asset forfeiture is only a small piece of this control, and many benefits of Bitcoin are not undermined by keeping your coins in a custodial account.

It's ECDSA (secp256k1) that would need to be cracked to derive the public key from the private key. Reversing SHA-256 would give you the public key from the wallet address.

Basically when the Bitcoin core client implements a hardfork, it's still Bitcoin. Otherwise it's an altcoin. This is due to there being no formal spec for Bitcoin; the core client is the reference implementation.
As much as I dislike the name and protocol being tied directly to a particular implementation, the alternatives are not necessarily better at this stage. Trying to evolve a formal spec through a working group would hinder development velocity substantially, and the core devs and BIP procedure *sort of* function as a working group already. In the future, once innovation slows down, I'm hopeful the consensus rules will become entirely RFC-driven which will enable use of a variety of client implementations (which is actually good for network stability -- one critical bug won't effect 100% of the network).

I encrypted my ledger seed with a passphrase and sent the encrypted form to both mine and my wife's email, and also backed it up with a few cloud storage providers. I personally feel this is safer than any form of physical storage, as only one of the third-party storage services needs to prove reliable, and they can't recover my seed, only lose/delete the encrypted form.
The only way a can lose access to my coins is if someone learns my passphrase or I forget it myself. Once every few months I boot a Linux live CD and ensure I can restore it fine.
I also use 2 independent seeds: one for cold storage (high balance) and one for short term spending/trading with the Ledger (lower balance).

If Bitcoin Cash adoption was growing at a similar rate, their blocks would fill up relatively soon as well ;-)
Part of the issue with scaling block size linearly with transaction volume (i.e. with adoption) is that adoption is currently growing exponentially at a much faster rate than network/computing capabilities. Bumping up the block size *would* reduce transaction fees, but it is a temporary bandage which has the potential to worsen decentralization. To support decentralized microtransactions and nanotransactions in the future at VISA+scale, off-chain recordkeeping is an absolute necessity.

If a fork can never work, then Bitcoin is centralized, as Core can make their code do anything they want. I'm not even sure what you're talking about in the title... forks "work" regularly and are a necessary part of evolving the network. Forks which actually change leadership of the dominant chain will be a lot harder to pull off, but aren't impossible, and *can't be* if the system is truly decentralized.

I can tell you with a good degree of certainty that when you introduce people to Bitcoin using words like "charlatan" and "shyster", and you tell them banks are simply out to steal their money, they're going to think *you're* the one trying to scam them.
You seem like a very black-and-white white type of person. The world is more nuanced than that. Trust is not *always* a bad thing.

It's easy to find articles that tell you what to do, but then you're still putting trust in the authors of those articles, and the authors of the software they tell you to use. Just the other day, the first search result for Bittrex was a phishing site... How do newbies know who they can trust? They've already implicitly trusted Coinbase with their USD in order to buy-in, so trusting them to store their coins safely is a minimal escalation of that trust.
Not to mention, storing your seed in a way that is both secure and accessible to you is a non-trivial problem. If you forget your Coinbase password, you can restore access within a few days. If you lose access to your seed, your coins are gone. See the guy a couple days ago that lost access to his coins even after taking precautions to setup redundant backups, just because he inadvertently reverted his Keepass keystore.

Running a CPU at 100 will certainly shorten it's lifespan if nothing else. It will also consume excess electricity and produce excess heat, both of which cost the user real money.
Not to mention, a lot of users' computers may not be equipped to run at 100 for extended periods. Think your grandma's computer, which probably hasn't seen an air duster once in its 10-year, cat-hair-infested existence. In this case excessive CPU usage can make the system overheat and crash, or perhaps in very extreme cases, catch fire.

I think use of "the blockchain" even when referring to multiple blockchains, cryptocurrencies, or blockchain tech in general, stems from the fact that the goal in each use-case is to establish a single authoritative and immutable chain. When you talk about storing some data on "the blockchain" you emphasize the authority/immutability aspects better than if you had said "a blockchain" -- anyone can write anything they want into *a* blockchain, but that doesn't mean it will become part of _the_ authoritative (longest) chain.

No you wouldn't; if nobody wanted to buy dollars, it's because they're worthless. McDonalds isn't going to give you burgers in exchange for something that the market agrees is worthless.
I don't compare fiat currencies to cryptocurrencies, and obviously fiat currencies will be more stable because they are carefully controlled. The consequence of this is that they will always be *falling* in value as new money is created in an attempt to stabilize the economy. Bitcoin is effectively a hedge against this.

One entity's impact on transaction cost can only be as great as the amount they are willing to invest into paying transaction fees to flood the network.
It's essentially a free market. Throughput on the Bitcoin network is a scarce resource much like Bitcoin itself. If Alice is willing to pay $5 for a Bitcoin transaction while Bob is only willing to pay $4, obviously Alice will get priority. If Bob's business relies on Bitcoin transactions costing no more than $4 in order to turn a profit, then it's a problem with Bob's business model, not an issue with the network.

Gold has been viable for far longer than that, but it's hard to store and use. As a result, gold-backed instruments replaced it as a means of exchange. Eventually these instruments lose their backing, in which case scarcity is controlled entirely by a few individuals, which is ironically about as "artificial" as it gets :)
Now we have an alternative to gold that doesn't have the same industrial uses, but is easier to use a means of exchange, and the supply can't realistically be changed. These properties, along with growing network effects, are what give Bitcoin intrinsic value. I don't think anyone can argue that Bitcoin is still 100% speculative.

This describes *how* Bitcoin is implemented, not *what* Bitcoin is. That's like saying stocks are integers associated with names in a shareholder registry. While technically true, it's not meaningful from a regulation standpoint since it doesn't say anything about what a stock actually is. The implementation could change (e.g. everyone could start using bearer shares) and the regulations could stay the same, since the core concept of a share (i.e. partial ownership of the issuing organization) hasn't changed.
Similarly, Bitcoin's implementation can change, most commonly through hard or soft forks. These changes shouldn't affect what Bitcoin is, from a regulatory standpoint.

First, different people value Bitcoin for different reasons.
Second, how is Bitcoin any more immutable than other Blockchains? A block chain is by definition immutable, but can be forked **from any point** if there is enough support, and we're literally a few weeks away from a potential hard fork. There is nothing in the Bitcoin tech which makes it less vulnerable to this sort of mutation.

ASICs can be developed for any algorithm, so thwarting them becomes a cat-and-mouse game of regularly changing the PoW algorithm, where a small number of people (the ones deciding which algorithm will be used next) possess a disproportionate amount of the power. It also reduces the overall hash rate, which makes 51% attacks cheaper.
On the other hand, if a single algorithm is used for long enough that a competitive ASIC market can form around it, the advantage any individual player has as a result of advancing their tech becomes smaller and smaller. A few years ago, an ASIC would become obsolete (unprofitable) within about 6 months of it being developed, so the ones making all the profit were the manufacturers themselves and whoever has access to cheap electricity nearby their FABs; now that lifecycle is easily more than a year, because the price to develop new ASIC tech is high relative to the edge it provides over previous generations.

At the moment, most would consider Bitcoin to be the least centralized option by a large margin (i.e. highest cost to reverse or censor a transaction). This might not always be the case, but it seems most other coins are focusing on different things, so I don't see many of them being serious competitors when you're looking for a censorship-resistant store of value.
@_date: 2018-12-31 12:01:27
Confidential Transactions and LN (to a degree) will help with this. I don't see a future where Bitcoin succeeds in its current non-fungible form; when you discard censorship-resistance, there's little incentive to use it.
