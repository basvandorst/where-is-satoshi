Speaking of miners, SatoshiDice recently increased the transaction fees they pay on their outgoing transactions from the standard 0.0005 BTC to double that, 0.001 BTC. Likely they're finding that they need that extra incentive to ensure their TX's get through. Block sizes are both hard limited to 1MB, as well as soft limited by the fact that larger blocks are less likely to be propagated to all of the network before someone else finds a different block. IE a larger block is more likely to get rejected by the network.

Or they'll switch to another chip and modify the design as required. Provided other FPGAs are available with equally good price-performance ratios they can switch chips. Given it's been what, 6 or 7 months since the first BFL Single shipped they might even find that another generation of chips is closer to being discontinued and available for cheap.

Stupid people. Deflation doesn't doom currencies, it dooms economies. Someone holding bitcoins only cares that the coins they are holding can be traded to someone else in the future for valuable things; how does it benefit that person directly for inflation to cause those coins to be worth less in the future?
The only way deflation can doom bitcoin is if the economic consequences of bitcoin deflation are considered to be serious enough that governments step in to ban bitcoin on that basis. This has happened before with gold to some extent; notably using gold as currency in the states was effectively banned for awhile. However there are far bigger threats to bitcoin's existence such as banning it on the basis that it can be useful for money laundering and tax evasion.
Note that I *do* think deflation is a very bad thing for economies. But saying deflation is going to doom bitcoin is as accurate as saying deflation is going to doom gold. Given that the *very meaning* of deflation is for the value of a currency to go up in the future, you can't exactly call that "dooming the currency"

One possibility is that they wanted to make sure that the digital currency that did catch on wasn't too good. You really only get one shot at creating a proof of work currency; after the first one people know what they're capable of and have the computer hardware available to attack new comers. Or, alternatively they figured out a better, non-proof-of-work system based on say, byzantine general style multi-party consensus algorithms, and wanted to make sure something attackable was made popular instead.
Having said that, do I believe this was the case? Not really.
Personally I think if it wasn't simply one or more interested cryptographers creating bitcoin because they could, a more likely creator would be organized crime or similar entities. Specifically, bitcoin is useful for them, especially as cash becomes less and less popular with governments, but creating a new currency with known ties to shady groups is an obvious non-starter. So invent some mysterious Japanese guy...

enmaku already explains quite well that there is nothing secret about the cryptographic credentials. But it goes even further than that: why should you need credentials at all?
Consider the example of leasing a car with this system: the manufacturer doesn't care *who* pays the lease, only *that* the lease is paid. The car could just as easily have an embedded computer with a tamper-proof clock, and a bitcoin address for lease payments. Every month the car will expect you to provide it evidence that the lease payment for that month has been paid. You the make your transaction on the Bitcoin network and the car can expect one of two things:
Scenario A: With some special software you extract the transaction you made, as well as the latest blockchain headers, from the Bitcoin network, put that data on a usb key, and insert the key into the car. The computer now checks that the transaction was valid, and that the difficulty of the blockchain headers is within expected bounds. For you to fool the car you'd have to have sufficient computer power to create a set of headers with that difficulty, a much more expensive task than stealing a car, but maybe worth while if you did it for a whole bunch of owners at once.
Scenario B: You make your transaction to the lease payment address, and the leasing company makes another transaction moving the money from that address to somewhere else. You upload to the car both transactions, which prove without doubt that you made the payment. The only way to hack that system is if you can somehow steal the leasing company's private key. Of course, if they stop making those transactions for some reason, you're screwed, but it's no worse than other remotely controlled lease arrangements.
Now are they really forced to honor any such script? Of course not. But that's a hardware and legal problem, not a math problem.

A nice bit of flair would be if clicking on an address links to a qr-code with payment instructions, or at least just the address. Lots of people have their wallets on their phones. Just make sure the qr-code is large enough to easily scan, should be about 1.5" square on the screen.

It's not just a matter of minimizing risk, but taking risks that you know and understand. Butterfly Labs is run by hardware guys, who understand hardware risks primarily. By selling their hardware they're taking risks that they understand, risks like their designs not working. They know how to estimate and mitigate those risks. They aren't finance experts, and if they got into the mining business itself they'd be taking (more) financial risks, like exchange rate risks, that they don't have the background to understand or mitigate.

However, there are a whole bunch of trusted computing initiatives for cloud servers. If you can trust Intel or whoever not to fuck that up - and they have a lot of incentive not too - it'll bypass Barak's assumptions underlying the proof quite nicely. Essentially the agent will only transfer its private keys to new servers that have authenticated themselves as following the trusted computing protocol, testifying that even someone with hardware access can't read the encryption keys stored on the computer.
Of course in practice hosting services might decide it's too risky to get a repuation for stealing balances, even of agents. What if the agent was actually a sneaky way to determine the trustworthyness of the hosting service?

I'd call that a worst case even for future scam victims. If the Pirate manages to successfully pay everyone back it legitimizes apparent ponzi schemes that in the vast majority of cases are just ponzi's.
FWIW One likely way he could be pulling this off is as a way to launder profits from the Silkroad. Assume he's paranoid about getting caught via coin taint, so he creates a fund with rates high enough that it's easy to raise enough BTC by investing in it. Then presto, you have a bunch of cash apparently earned by some mysterious fund with great interest rates. Shady, but not illegal.
It'd also explain why getting money into the fund is so difficult, and has become increasingly so. Similarly why rates were getting cut. 7% a week will outpace even silkroad's profits.

But there is a key difference between gold mining and Bitcoin mining: with the former economies of scale are are required for profitable production, with the latter economies of scale are required for profitable production of the *means of production*.
With Bitcoin mining the actual production itself looks like it'll remain highly distributed by many small miners who have bought BFL Labs (and maybe others) equipment. That doesn't mean mining itself is centralized, especially from the point of view of network centralization. The hardware is pretty "dumb" and can't do much without the software driving it that chooses how to create the blocks and hence what transactions to mine; that software is not proprietary.
If anything the actual operation of a mining appliance appears to be something where economies of scale don't exist, because on a small scale you can ignore issues like cooling, and often even power consumption, (dorm rooms, unmetered apartments, places with electrical heating etc.) that turn into large costs at the large scale.
The gold mining analogy would be some bizzaro world where staking claims and acquiring land to mine on was something anyone could do, but your shovels were ultra-high tech tools requiring massive infrastructures to build, yet a single person can operate a shovel, and the only way to build a better shovel was to tape a bunch of small ones together.
What can I say, technology analogies are weird sometimes...

Bitcoin implements a notion of coin age, that is, how old are the coins you are trying to spend. Transaction fees go up and the coins you are trying to spend get younger. You're going to soon run out of older coins, and you'll find yourself spending far more per transaction in fees than a legit user will in your attempt to make the legit user pay more money.

You're missing my point.
Bitcoin mining may require dedicated equipment, but the equipment itself is still relatively inexpensive. Even the most expensive ASIC rigs, around $30,000, are still within reach of individuals and will remain so. Compare that to gold mines, where an operation with a million dollars worth of capital is considered very small, and most mines have hundreds of millions to low billions worth of capital investment. Equally many, many orebodies just can't be mined at all without spending those hundreds of millions up-front. Bitcoin mining on the other hand has costs that are pretty much linear with how many GH/s you want to mine.
There also isn't any particular reason to think this situation is going to change: while producing an ASIC requires the investment of at least a few hundred thousand dollars, with competitive ones in the millions to tens of millions, the actual per-chip price will always be at most one or two hundred dollars. Bitcoin mining is an "embarrassingly parallel" problem so once you have a really fast chip, you can't get much benefit with better surrounding infrastructure around that chip. Look how BFL's top of the line ASIC Mini Rig costs $20/GH, while their bottom of the line Jalapeno offering is only a little worse at $30/GH. The difference in profitability due to capital costs between the two, 33%, is plenty low enough to be made up by small scale operators who can ignore cooling requirements for instance.
Comparing this to cloud computing operations is very misleading because while Bitcoin mining is an extremely simple operation, compute SHA256 hashes quickly, cloud computing is far more complex with issues like backups, reliability, network bandwith, etc. Economies of scale exist for cloud computing, especially in the custom software to do it well, that just don't exist for Bitcoin mining.
The other thing is that investors want to keep the business of making Bitcoin mining equipment separate from the business of actually mining. The two are totally different businesses, with very different risk profiles, capital requirements, and payback cycles, so investors will want to be able to pick and choose what exposure they have rather than having the two bundled up together. Thus it makes sense for ASIC mfg's to sell their equipment to anyone who buys it. You actually see something quite similar in the mineral mining industry where companies tend to specialize in a single resource as much as possible, so a gold company will never also operate copper mines. There are exceptions of course when an ore body contains two separate metals, but investors would be happier if those ore bodies were separate. Similarly it's quite rare for mining companies to also act as mining equipment manufacturers.

You're very wrong about the layer count.
SHA256 hash collisions, IE, bitcoin mining, is a unique application that requires very, very little bandwidth between miner chips. Remember that the mining software, either at the pool server or locally, builds a block and then hands a very small part of that, the header, to the actual mining ASIC. That header is only 80 bytes and includes a 32-bit nonce value. The miner then starts trying hashes, starting at nonce value 0 and ending at nonce value 2^32 - 1
So basically the bandwidth required between the chip and the outside world is about four billion times less than the bandwidth required within the chip. This is totally unlike most board designs where you need to pass a lot of data between different chips on different parts of the board. In fact they could probably get away with something as simple and slow as a 3-wire SPI bus, one wire for input, one for output, and one for the clock. Heck, even a 2-wire I2C bus where input and output are shared.
Lets assume the ASIC's are fast enough to need 100 new nonce ranges to a second. We'll assume for each nonce range the host computer hash to give the ASIC a whole 80byte block, and lets throw in another 20 bytes of overhead. 8 * 100 * 80=64,000bytes/second. Absolutely trivial. They might even be able to make a design using a *two layer* PCB if they were clever about how they routed power and still managed to keep the ground plane continuous.

Yes there is, if you can trust the person who sent you the coins not to double spend. One way to achieve that trust, is to have the other person be using hardware that won't let them doublespend. Of course, this is pretty much how MintChip works, but with bitcoins rather than dollars.
Note though that this anti-doublespend system conflicts with the ability to have a cleartext backup of your private keys, or you'd be able to doublespend outside of the context of bitcoincard. I dunno what choices they have made with regards to this, quite possibly you can operate in both modes, or they left the feature out.

It's one of those things that can't be elegent, much like Bitcoin itself. What you can't do with pure computer science/math theory, you can do if you add some assumptions about how the hardware works. In the case of Bitcoin there is an assumption that computer power is limited and widely distributed, in the case of trusted computing hardware you're making some assumptions that certain cryptographic identities provide certain guarantees. Don't forget how ugly Bitcoin's design looks to the experts who reviewed it in the beginning.
It works through both. IE, they try their hardest to keep the exact designs obscure, but at the same time they assume the designs have leaked and make them genuinely secure. The whole anti-security-by-obscurity thing is only needed in the commercial world because they lack the resources, and market pressure, to do things right in the first place. Military and intelligence stuff generally has enough internal pressure to do things right. For one thing, the US military and intelligence agencies internally have enough experts to genuinely vet designs in a way that commercial buyers rarely do.
Also, don't underestimate how hard it is to work with really advanced silicon. By the time you get down to 22nm and less, you're getting to the point where a big part of the difficulty of making the chips in the first place is that often you can't test arbitrary structures in any detail simply because physics just doesn't let you probe things directly. For instance, if a bit is stored as a collection of 1000 electrons, and any conceivable probe has a resolution of 2000 electrons, you have no mechanism to determine the state of that bit except for getting the hardware itself to read it out to you. If that hardware in turn is difficult to probe, or modify in situ, you might just be totally screwed.
@_date: 2012-08-19 16:27:25
The bits are stored on the gates of [floating-gate transistors]( better known as EEPROM or Flash memory. Essentially such a transistor works on static electricity. You know how if you charge up a balloon by rubbing it you can feel things being attracted to them? Well if you pattern a bit of silicon such that there is a completely insulated bit of conductor you can charge up that conductor with electrons, and yet still be able to sense the presence or absense of those electrons by the force they exert at a distance.
One big advantage of using floating gates is that the chip can program itself. IE during manufacturing power will be applied, and the chip will generate a secret key, and a corresponding public key. The public key gets signed by the manufacturer's master secret key and then the whole lot is written to floating gate transistors internal to the chip. Once that process is done a pulse of current is then applied destroying all the circuitry that allows for the keys to be written to. Sometimes the silicon mask will have circuitry that can read the keys as well, in that case part of the pulse is used to destroy that circuit as well.
The problem is if the circuitry to read the keys *ever* existed it can be repaired with certain specialized techniques. On the other hand, it becomes harder to test the chips if you don't put in a debug mode that breaks the security. So obviously manufacturers of cheaper chips tend to use the worse security approach.
In the case of an Intel CPU with trusted computing stuff in it you run into another problem: modern CPU manufacturing techniques makes for silicon with great speed and density, but the silicon makes for terrible non-volatile memory. It used to be you just couldn't buy CPU's with any non-volatile memory in them at all, but apparently there has been a lot of research into solving this problem. Going back to your thing about "etching" the key, that's the issue. If you can't use a floating-gate transistor to store the key, you have to do something else, such as fuse-based memory or laser etched memory, both of which change the physical structure of the chip and are much easier to probe the state of because you can just look at them directly.

Intel would keep a secret signing key in some vault, then use that to sign the signing keys that are embedded in the CPU's themselves. If such a key gets compromised, it goes on the revocation list. Very similar to how SSL certificate authorities are supposed to work. In this scenario your total loss is limited to whatever your agent will trust to a single signing identity, as all that effort only gets you one identity. You would of course use a distributed trust list so your agent network won't put too much trust in any one identity.
Also, sure in theory you "just" disassemble it and look at it with a microscope, but by the time you get down to 22 nano meter scale chips this gets exceptionally difficult. Future hardware is also likely to include increasingly good anti-tamper mechanisms that wipe the keys as you try to disassemble the chip.

Even easier is for the attacker can just encrypt the data first too with a known encryption key, or an encryption key that can be calculated from the transaction inputs. Encrypted data looks totally random, just like pubkeys and especially pubkey hashes. In fact this idea works great combined with namespaces - do a HMAC hashing the calculated encryption key with the namespace and now unless you know the namespace you have no idea if the transaction is financial or not.

Zerocoin takes far more resources than the Bitcoin network can handle. It would mean for the *current* level of transaction volume, the blockchain would have to be about 1000x larger, and that number just gets worse over time.

That's the problem, that code is running the network, and you need to either have a supermajority of hashing power, or match it bug-for-bug.

They won't produce blocks too big to propagate to the majority of hashing power, but they would be happy to ignore a few percent, perhaps the miners behind tor proxies or miners in far-off countries with crappy internet connections, or even just the humble decentralized P2Pool miner at home. The exact miners who are most difficult to co-opt, because they are the most difficult to find. Those miners will effectively drop out from Bitcoin eventually because they'll find they can't keep up, and that's good from the perspective of the larger, better funded miners in heavily populated countries with good internet connections.
Repeat this cycle a few times and you'll soon find that the majority of hashing power is comprised of a small number of miners who have invested heavily in fast computers and fast internet connections, neither of which helps keep Bitcoin secure.
Keep in mind that the bigger blocks get, the higher orphan rates become, and those rates are highest for those with the slowest internet connections. It's irrelevant to a well-funded corporate mining farm or pool - they'll just buy some pricey fiber internet and amortize it across thousands of dollars of mining equipment or pool clients - but it will be the death-knell for decentralized P2Pool miners who just won't be able to download blocks fast enough to keep their orphan rate reasonably low.
@_date: 2013-02-19 05:28:07
Well, Gavin and Mike Hearn are promoting allowing even multi-gigabyte blocks, so that every transaction, even microtransactions, can happen on chain. You'll need thousands of dollars with of computer equipment and very fast internet connections to be able to run an independent mining operation with multi-gigabyte blocks, or even just to run a relay node. There aren't all that many pools even now when creating a pool is cheap, so why would there be enough pools to make a 51% attack hard if operating a pool costs tens of thousands of dollars in overhead?
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:47:47
Decentralization. Right now it's just barely possible to run a miner anonymously over Tor. Raise the blocksize and all miners will have to be in datacenters with fast connections and that makes it easy for governments to start tracking them down and regulating them, like forcing them to check transactions against blacklists of "bad" addresses.
There is a reason FinCEN mentioned miners in their last announcement.

That's his point. Proof code is going to be incredibly complex and there will be lots of bugs.
The developers have a hard enough time ensuring Bitcoin stays stable with the current codebase, let alone keeping it all working about literally doubling the number of critical lines of code by adding proofs.
Keep in mind that the current code-base is extremely unlikely to have a really deep re-org be caused by a bug, where with proofs it's actually one of the more likely bugs to happen.

Bitcoin *is* a decentralized voting system based on hashing power. It lets you vote on the order of transactions.

Engineering does not care about your notions of "culture"
If you want to be helpful, take the bitcoin-qt sourcecode and separate out the consensus critical parts (the scripting system, the UTXO set code, the proof-of-work evaluation etc.) into a stand-alone library, and base your work on that library. Note that this library does not actually need the networking code, or wallet code, or any ideas about what is or isn't a standard transaction.
@_date: 2013-02-19 17:37:40
What you want is called trust-free mixing transactions. Basically multiple people provide the inputs to a transaction, and together they select the outputs. They then combine everything into a single transaction, and each person creates signatures signing each input they control. Only if every single input is signed is the transaction valid, so it's completely safe to do this.
gmaxwell had a [thread]( on the forums a few weeks ago where he invited strangers to create such transactions manually with him. His intent was simply to "taint rich" but you can also use the technique to enhance privacy as you suggest. For the recent Bitcoin Foundation grant proposal thing Gavin suggested that someone make an automated service to do this. Hopefully someone takes up the idea and makes it happen.
@_date: 2013-02-11 09:52:40
Application specific hardware, AKA ASICS, isn't a big deal. The SHA256 function that miners do is an extremely simple, extremely parallizable problem where the efficiency of a miner with just a few hundred dollars worth of equipment is nearly the same as a miner with a few hundred thousands. If anything free electricity gives small miners the advantage.
The real danger to Bitcoin is if block sizes are increased. 1MB/block is something anyone can buy the hardware for, and in addition, 1MB/block allows you to mine behind some really crummy network connections, in particular tor proxies.
But if Gavin and others get there way and allow for floating block sizes, big miners have every incentive to push block sizes as high as possible, because while there aren't any economies of scale in the mining hardware itself, there are enormous economies of scale in the hardware required to store and validate the blockchain.
Do *NOT* allow the maximum block size to be increased. It's the most likely way for Bitcoin to become centralized. Low-value transactions can always happen on services built on-top of bitcoin, like off-chain transaction processing services. But if we let the block size increase your high value transactions, your life savings, WILL be at risk.

The simple reality is no-one knows for sure how many of the early coins could still be spent. Most likely a lot of the early miners just lost their wallets and those coins will never move, but no-one knows for sure.
The source code is totally open source and anyone can examine it:  There isn't any automatic update system. I wouldn't be surprised if the developers don't want to include one for fear of it getting hacked.
I think the real issue is that the lead developer, Gavin Andresen, and another one of the core developers, Mike Hearn, want to remove the block size limit. The problem is right now Bitcoin is limited to 7 transactions per second so that anyone can run a Bitcoin node and participate fully in the network. If that limit is lifted, only large entities will be able to afford to run Bitcoin nodes and mining pools, which means those large entities have the power to determine what transactions are allowed, and who is allowed to make them. That will probably be mostly banks and other large companies subject to government regulation.

Unfortunately your idea doesn't work. You can't be an effective miner unless you can keep up with the entire transaction volume, because if you aren't keeping up you don't know what transactions have or have not been spent. Without knowing that you'll produce blocks that include already spent transactions, and hence are invalid. At the same time, the big cost of running a mining pool will be running the full validating node to keep up with the transaction volume.
The worst part about it is larger miners can use this to attack you, by including transactions in their blocks, and then submitting those same transactions to you. You'll waste your hashing power, and they'll benefit from the reduced competition.

They only need to control enough nodes for there to be a high probability that your three hop connection goes only through nodes they control.

There is a very big difference though between the blockchain and a bank database. The bank data base just stores the information but the blockchain acts as a means to distribute it. If this crap catches on we could see people use the blockchain as a filesharing tool for high-value data. Sure it's really expensive. But lots of data is worth that much.

Connectivity isn't scarce in the way hashing power is; it's something where the price to buy a lot of it is dramatically less than the price to buy a small amount.

Every Bitcoin transaction goes on a public blockchain. Sure you can try to be careful and make sure no-one figures out which pubkey is associated with what identity, but that's really hard to do consistantly.
For instance did you know that an SPV client, like your Android wallet, has to tell the Bitcoin node it's connected too what addresses are in it's wallet so the node only forwards transactions related to your wallet?
On the other hand with payment processors, you just have to move your money through a few of them and now any investigator needs to get warrants for every one to follow the trail. They may be in totally different countries, and some of those payment processors may be totally anonymous, like the Silk Road or Black Market Reload's payment system. Not to mention chaum tokens as you say.
It's not perfect, but I really welcome wide-spread payment processor support for the privacy advantages.

You can't have  and  at the same time. P2Pool relies on every miner running a full verifying node, which isn't going to happen if 10000's of transactions a second mean you need a really expensive internet connection and thousands of dollars in harddrives to store the UTXO set.
You can get  and  if you accept that transacting on the Bitcoin blockchain itself will become expensive, as you hint about micro-transactions. But for that the 1MB blocksize must remain fixed.

You know what, I think I misread the OP's post and understood it as a scenario with a higher limit. So yes, what's he's saying is pretty much right, and I'm wrong.
I agree 100% we have to keep the blocksize limit to the level where anyone can afford to run a node, including behind anonymity technologies like Tor. Low-value transactions can always be done with off-chain system; what's important is keeping the system as a whole secure.

Tor is a great example of a technology that provides pretty good privacy, (no pun intended) yet against a determined attacker with a lot of resources fails. A government can afford to run enough Tor nodes secretly to get lucky once in a while and follow the whole chain for intelligence purposes, so if you are a rival government, using Tor is unsafe.
On the other hand, if you are a big enough government, your agents can use Tor pretty safely because they blend in with the hundreds of thousands of normal average users who use it.
Not a surprise then that Tor was developed by the US government, and continues to promote themselves quite heavily to law enforcements and militaries around the world for how useful Tor is to them, for the exact same reason it's useful to you or I:

Looks like the data was stored in the scriptPubKey's of a transactions outputs. That's the part that controls if a particular transaction output can be spent. That data is also known as the Unspent Transaction Output set, or UTXO set.
The problem is while you're pretty sure all the data is actually data, and thus there doesn't exist a scriptSig that would satisfy the scriptPubKey and thus allow the transaction output to be spent, you can never be 100% sure. If different people use different blacklists to decide what transaction outputs to strip/censor, the moment one of the transactions is spent the network forks. At best you might have some sort of 51% vote, but that implies that the majority could vote to freeze your funds too. Kinda a scary prospect when you think how it would take just two mining pools to make that vote happen. 
In short, there isn't any easy way to remove this data from the blockchain without a central authority and if there was that same authority could be used to freeze your funds.
EDIT: I added it up and to insert this data into the blockchain cost 3.13BTC in fees, or about ~$500 at current prices. They also paid fairly high fees of about 0.001BTC per kilobyte. Of course $500 to attack the blockchain is nothing for our enemies.

If you don't care about the size of miners, then promote a nice, efficient, single miner controlling 100% of the hashing power. Or better yet, just use PayPal.
Efficiency is not just about how many MH/s a miner controls, it's about how big the miner is to make sure no one miner can get &gt;50% of the hashing power, either because they are malicious, or because they and a few other big pools get hacked all at once.
