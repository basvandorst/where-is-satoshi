If you want no exchange fee, use buttercoin.  But takes a few days.
If you want speed, use a credit card on purse.io. But you pay a big premium.
If you want somewhere in between, use local bitcoins.

There's no incentive to do this.  Do these participants trust each other? If not, it would be too easy for one party to attack the network and allege false transactions.  And if they do trust each other, there's no need for a decentralized database.

When you were a kid and you held a quarter for the first time, it probably had a nice solid feel to it.  Now it seems thinner and flimsier.
We're used to inflation.  100 dollars used to mean something.  Today that won't even fill a grocery cart.  The long term psychological effect is that dollars don't feel particularly enticing.
Bitcoin on the other hand is the exact opposite: we expect it to appreciate.  So it's fun :)

buttercoin is a bitcoin exchange doesn't have any fees through till the end of march. -&gt;  in fact they even give 20 bucks to start.
Same with coinbase exchange: no exchange fees until the end of march.  But not available in certain locations/jurisdiction.

You have a strong case against AT&amp;T.  They are guilty of breach of contract.  Additionally there may be law in this case requiring AT&amp;T to uphold their internal policy of requiring more than an email address to forward phone calls.

What do you see bitcoin doing to the industry you used to work in?

What's got the two of you so pissed off?  So people get excited about their investments appreciating.  What's the big deal?

Another vote that the name is a faux pas.  I immediately thought, "altcoin" and turned away.  I think you have a cool concept but a bad name.

Not sure if you're serious, but there's a few problems with this:
1) Game theory.  If everyone colluded to destroy some bitcoin, participants would have a strong temptation to defect from the plan and preserve their own stash.  Look up the prisoner's dilemma or free rider problem.
2) For any currency that is sufficiently big enough, there's an inverse linear relationship between supply and price.  So if everyone magically lost half of their bitcoins, no one would gain or lose any value.  This should theoretically be true with stamps, but their may be some additional psychological factors at play when it's a question of a total supply of only one or two stamps.
Anyway, in your stamp example, the collector should have actually preserved the second copy, and sold it decades after everyone assumed it had been destroyed.

Why would avoiding google help protect bitcoin? Who told you that?

Dark represents transactions that were in the mempool before the last block confirmation.
Light represents transactions that were received since confirmation of the last block.
Generators store transactions waiting to get into a block in their memory pool after receiving them. Received transactions are stored even if they are invalid to prevent nodes from constantly requesting transactions that they've already seen. The memory pool is cleared when Bitcoin is shut down, causing the network to gradually forget about transactions that haven't been included in a block.

Could you please elaborate?
Thank you.

Very true.  I used to buy a lot of stuff on amazon.com.  When I found out about purse.io, which offers 20-25% off of your amazon purchases if you use bitcoin, I got excited.  But then I browsed amazon and realized there really wasn't anything to entice me to let go of my bitcoin.
I save a lot more now.  In usd, it's really not that fun to watch your bank account balance go up.  With bitcoin it is.

I'd also like an honest answer about how it's easier to use.
Like, in public places, credit cards are easier than using a smartphone app.  And online, it doesn't really get any easier than amazon's 1 click ordering.
Is this just a state of affairs for the time being?  Arguably, it's easier to use it on sites when you don't want to bother with giving them your information, but if you're a person who does business with the same merchants over and over this isn't really a factor.
And I've seen people make posts saying how easy it is to pay at a restaurant with a smartphone, but let's be real, are credit cards hard? I just can't get on board with the idea that it's easier to use.  Not right now anyway.  Maybe if someone could argue that this will change as the ecosystem develops...
Am I missing something?
