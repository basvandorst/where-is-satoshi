Are you sure you don't mean 2:42? Because, it seems awfully relevant as well...

Effectively crushing a likely very profitable, and likely legal business. In reality, they just prevented a business from making a profit that they now won't.
What is worse is that I was going to buy an Amazon gift card, so that I could buy a gift card to a local brick and mortar store. It would have meant sales tax for my state. 
Now neither state or federal are going to see any of it as I will likely buy what I was going to buy new, second hand with cash. What are the chances the person I buy from is honest enough to report a small one time cash in come?

Some of them multiple times.

Some call that "Fuck you." money.

It really depends on how you go about working it into your income. If you use local transactions for cash you can easily blend in an extra $100-200 a month by using the cash to buy consumable goods.
Using such a method also gives room for your BTC purchasing power to fluctuate, which depending on how you think bitcoin is going to pan out, could possibly outpace the interest on a mortgage as well.
Sure it could still trigger poking around, but much less likely if you do it gradually as opposed to a full cash out. 
**Edit:** I accidentally an extra word.

Sounds like you made off pretty well then. Congratulations on not getting completely screwed by BFL.

Depending on your apartment complex you stand a chance of your rent going up if they notice an increase in their electric bill, yes this risk distributed among other in the complex, but could still poses a chance of cutting into your earnings at some point.

I'm not saying I wouldn't simply pay my tax on any BTC to Fiat conversion. Just explaining how it would be fairly easy to do using smaller transactions. 
 It also takes time, which is valuable, to seek out a someone for a cash exchange. There is also risk in any currency that your purchasing power could diminish drastically.  
I'm not looking to get into a debate on taxes, but you make a really valid point that about paying back a system that is working for you.

Given that you've reinstalled several times this is an insane long shot, but I have managed to recover some smaller files before even after reinstalling. You could try [photorec](

You still there? I think they might have figured out how to turn on their computer... Yep... They are still waiting for it to load the desktop though...

Just don't share the news. Take the windfall and carry on business as usual. I know that would be hard, but it keeps your mates from the "Oh George will buy our drinks." mentality, as well as the "Can you spare a few?" lines. 
I'd also certainly take the lady to a nice upscale dinner, but that's just me.

Utilities are included in my rent and my rent is on par with the rest of the housing around me, I just have to live in an studio as compared to a one bedroom.

Sorry, I should clarify what I meant. 
I was simply saying that technically you are supposed to report cash in come and pay taxes. The point being they are up in arms about regulating digital currencies because they are scared of them, not for tax purposes, or they would be chasing after these sorts of things as well.

As a miner who doesn't have to pay for their electricity, yep. Barely making .005 a day, but I've got the hardware and it has paid for itself many times over already so no reason not to keep chugging.

Utilities are included in my rent. I picked my apartment because heat was included and I live in Wisconsin which has its fair share of cold winters. I discovered bitcoin shortly after moving in.

I've been meaning to try this place out. Might have to take a stroll over there this weekend.

I live in Wisconsin, as far as mining income, Compared to what it used to mine a few months ago and the increase in difficulty it is only a matter of months before that is even halved, but I'll keep mining until utilities aren't included or my cards die.
