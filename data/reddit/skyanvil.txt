Well, unless Apple trademarked "Apple" or "iPhone" for stoves, it may actually be fine.
Trademarks are only for the specific areas of commerce/product/services that they are associated with.
Hence, "Apple" for computer products and electronic devices.
Did Apple ever sell a stove?  Nope.

China is only banning Apple from government procurement.

Or just trying to replicate what US did to the Native Americans, i.e. Oh look, we have these great shiny BEADS for you!
Now I guess, some might be thinking, why not sell some worthless things called Bitcoins, get them up in prices really high, and then sell them to China in exchange for the debts.
*sorry if you have faith in Bitcoin, but from China's perspective, it feels like a scam.  (Wait, you want us to buy these NUMBERS, with US dollars??  I think I'll stick with some land in California).

Only fakes are shipped to US.

Their stance, as usual, is:
If there is no downside yet, why worry.
But if they see a clear problem, they will clamp down in a heartbeat.

I don't think they want to "offer" or "lead".
Polls of Chinese population and even the Chinese military have indicated that majority of Chinese have NO desire to see China as a  superpower or "leader".
(They just have some pride in their own achievements, and they don't give a damn about other "world leaders".)
I don't know who is "cheerleading China on a grand scale".  And you are not giving much details about that "grand scale".
Certainly, there are some in the West who are more positive on China (probably mainly because they make a lot of money from businesses in China).  I wouldn't call that "cheerleading".  That's just their own personal CHOICE and personal VIEW on China.
I don't know why some people would get all bothered by that.
