Yeah, I'd like that to come from someone whose username isn't directly related to the app.

Honest question: Is having that many wallets really needed? Like, _in real life where hackers aren't as prominent as, say, musicians_? It's just a circlejerking about OMG SECURITEEE or what?
Because honestly, if Bitcoin is "really that secure", then having 5 wallets kinda go against that statement.

3 different locations? why? I'm really asking! I already use keepass so I'm in the right path it seems =P (new to this coin thing)

Agree, I fully support this idea, but people in general are brainwashed, as you can see for the downvotes.
These games in particular, they give you money back, though. I don't get the business model unless they're founded by some VC, hoping to resell or whatever.
PS: holy shit this game is ugly af.

The one I'm using (I just started) it's literally called "Bitcoin Wallet", from F-Droid. Thank you so much for the explanation.
This security thing gets both annoying and fun at the same time, lol. Thanks again.

I won't be moving any huge amount of moneys nor I'm involved in any illegal activities. Here, have some trigger keywords for your NSA dudes for proof: bomb, make, syria, muslim, pentagon, encryption, drugs, buy, guns. 
That said, I just want a somewhat simple and secure system to transfer money along with PayPal, which sucks. I understand the predicament that "running your own bank" is risky, but a lot of these recommendations seem to be completely overkill and a waste of time until you figure out how to use it (it took me a couple weeks to grasps the basics, and there are still more stuff to learn). I'm still waiting for someone to recommend me to hire a private guard to safeguard the hardware wallet.
The irony about this whole thing is that Bitcoin was born to stop depending on paper bills, banks and control. Yet it seems that we need to have paper bills (sweep paper I think it's called), banks (hardware wallet) and control (addresses, though this one isn't a problem).

how is running a fully patched windows insecure? I use a decent firewall and I store all my keys in KeePass behind a high quality master password that isn't written anywhere (it's on my brain) most of my keys can't be keylogged because I use obfuscatjon. Besides that, I plan to get the private key recovery codes stored somewhere else, physically, and using an Android wallet. Isn't that enough?

without proof I could say the same about any system
