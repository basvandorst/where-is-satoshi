$850 or 3.81 BTC is total for the one order of mine (listed above) that did not go thru 
Which is also the amount owed to me

or pay your rent if you live in memphis,
treat it as a commodity and make dolla bills,
purchase anything needed to build a computer,
one site will buy things off of amazon for you,
and many many others things outside of silk road

Why not just ask for peoples BTC Wallet ID and refund them?

Not entirely true - On my order the API barfed and i received a string of variables with their associated values.
Having been waiting six days now for them to do anything besides say, "did it work this time"
was at 125 when I placed my instant order.
They are making large sums of money right now, why not just refund everyone and figure it out on their end.

This one was without the API problem, thought this was the one that went thru. Purchased BTC on April3rd for 125.59, now 223 initial deposit was 480, so would now be 850.

One guy on here has had nothing happen in one month.
If you have a problem they will never contact you back.
If they really cared they would just give refunds and stop having customers wait for weeks to months on end.
One week for me tomorrow, pretty sure nothing will happen tonight.
