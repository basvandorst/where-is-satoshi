I just recently opened a wallet that was four years old and found 0.01 btc

Congratulations! Join the “you are insane club”. Awesome! You will be greatly rewarded for trusting in this trustless global math based currency.

You go boy!!!!
@_date: 2019-03-01 14:37:32
See if you have the private keys hidden somewhere ��
@_date: 2019-03-10 07:54:35
Definitely not. Each individual has different needs. I am just exaggerating a bit on this clip but the point is clear that this new asset is very valuable.
@_date: 2019-03-03 13:53:51
Brilliant and genius! I love it!!!!!
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:26:29

I guess now he sees the light.

@_date: 2017-01-23 20:12:03
Yeah, i see. But the fact that he now admits Bitcoin is not a failed experiment is interesting.
@_date: 2017-01-23 20:12:48
really. I have never heard of this guy until now.

I just liked her suave way of explaining blockchain tech. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 20:12:26
I see
@_date: 2019-08-14 13:47:12
Wow what a loser
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:29:14
@_date: 2016-12-12 16:18:30
Yes, you can use Bitcoin for anything.
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:24:28
Never thought about this. This post is correct in bringing up this issue. Aren’t they already looking at different Satoshi symbols? I believe if more people get away from buying a whole bitcoin then this will create more individuals with the opportunity to increase their wealth immensely.

I love this. We need more of this art to get the picture across. 
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:08:05
In 2022 it will also put a huge smile on my face as well
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:05:47
Sooooooooooo true! 
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:11:44
Well written article.
@_date: 2019-02-23 11:27:54
Wow here we go!
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:19:08
Join the party lol
@_date: 2019-04-06 10:38:11
I love it. Can we get a copy?
@_date: 2019-12-15 15:29:39
True, very true

Wavesplatform is getting ready to break another key resistance trendline. As you can see in this chart with Waves the top line is called the resistance and the bottom line is called the support. Whenever these lines are violated then watch out for the upside or downside. What I am seeing here is that if Waves continues to stay above this resistance line then we could possibly go higher with Waves. Waves is now at $0.60 and holding strong.
