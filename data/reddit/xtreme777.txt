Can or will? Can? Sure why not.  Will? Probably not.

Is this a nod to Phillip K. Dick?  If so, nice!
If not, you should read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.

Excellent! Cheers to you! Glad I could help! 
The instructions to install it on your phone on the Coinbase website should be removed because that way didn't work for me either.  There appears to be way to actually install another device like the app says.

I had the same problem. Install the authy app on your pc through chrome, add your landline number and use the voice/call option. Enter the code on the screen (mine was a 2 digit number). This should link authy with your account. Authy generates 2 factor codes for coinbase. I used that to get back in. Then I authenticated my cell phone and my google voice number just in case.

Hello Central Bank.  I'd like to borrow all of your money.  What do you mean you can pay me if I have all of your money?

Sounds like there really needs to be only two banks.  One to borrow from, and one to do the borrowing.

That's what I was saying lol

I'm still in the negative.  Meh.

Thank you for the oversimplification.  Seriously.  I'm not an idiot but I am new to Bitcoin so any knowledge I can gain on this is very welcomed!
