What about transferring to GDAX, and then to a wallet? Or is there high transaction fees going from coinbase to GDAX?

I definitely will be from now on. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:47:07
Maybe but this seems a bit extreme? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:52:45
Too right, it's just easy using Coinbase. Lesson learned.

For real? I just downloaded coin base but haven't bought anything yet, is it really as straight forward as verifying then buying BTC??

Just wondering what do youconsider a "large" amount of Bitcoin? Anything over 1 Bitcoin? Or do you think it changes with market price?

What the fuck is this shit?
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:23:36
Seconded. And also how to go from an online exchange to a wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:50:25
Sorry but just to clarify, when you say paper wallet, this is physically printing off the keys and storing them somewhere?

Also, are there any fees for transferring from coinbase to my own wallet? Or is that just when I am selling my bitcoin for fiat?

Great, thanks for all the information, I appreciate it!

So what's the difference coinbase and GDAX? I use coinbase to use fiat to buy bitcoin, but then what purpose is GDAX?  This is my first time hearing about GDAX.

Brilliant explanation, cleared up alot for me. Thanks.

I've been using coinbase. So if I'm understanding you correctly, I need an individual wallet for each type of coin? So meaning if I wanted a hardware wallet I'd have to have a hardware wallet for bitcoin/litecoin etc? 
I've only small amounts for now, but I want to start understanding what I need to do as regards having full control over my coins when the time comes. Thanks for the reply!
