I’m buying now because I sold a chunk at 17k. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:10:52
No.... iirc they always said they were holding it for people that held BTC on there pre fork, and would give it to people “around the new year.” What was shady, is the exact day was a surprise and they didn’t allow selling and buying (or weren’t able to?). Seemed a lot like insider trading happened with the price being manipulated by their own actions. 
They never said “we will never add BCASH” to my knowledge.

Every time we reach a new high and don’t have memes prepared there is a correction until the meme lords get their shit together. Basic crypto economics

Rome wasn’t built in a day? I don’t know. I totally agree that it’s a broken technology currently. I’m not a code kind of guy, but I have hopes that the nerds will sort it out and we can all have lambos in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:44:03
No, other than I believe in the technology/security of the block chain and therefore I expect it will continue to be valuable to humanity in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:43:52
Yea it literally just has a different name or something. Not even that sophisticated of a loophole.

Exactly... where the hell do you get your weed from?

It’s down to what it was a few weeks ago. Welcome to bitcoin. It goes up and down a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:49:53
Agreed, I guess what I mean is I think it’s a good to be diversified across USD, Gold, and bitcoin. Whatever

It’s also a car.

The other dude means you requested your account be deleted by clicking on the thing that says delete account. Like I’m requesting this comment be posted by clicking the “post” button.

Could have said that at the $100 and $1000 and $10,000 mark too though..

Sweet Jesus 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:53:52
I don’t know shit about shit, but once you send bitcoins I don’t think you can reverse it. Even with 0 transactions. Maybe I’m wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:55:28
This guy had real Jncos 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:05:54
I see it as a store of value against the USD or gold. Like if the value of the dollar plummets it will hold value against that. Same way that gold is a store of value against the value of the dollar.
Also bitcoin didn’t lose 1/3 if it’s value. I’m in since early 2014. It depends on your time frame. 
Personally I’ve felt it’s been overvalued since it crossed 5k. It’s been very volatile since it’s been in the mainstream news for about the last month. 
It’s worth what it’s worth because people are willing to exchange at that value. I think there is inherent value in the technology and security of the block chain. Just my 2 cents. 
I only bought in what I was willing to lose, just like any other risky investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:43:05
Not trying to get involved in your intentions. It seems like you misunderstood the other guy and I was trying to clear up the confusion. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:32:08
I fully expect a crash back to about 5k later 2017 or early 2018

I would love a BTC tip, but I really don't know how it works through reddit. I have some BTC in Coinbase and Electrum but it's really so confusing for me.
@_date: 2014-08-29 23:08:38
TL;DR: this is actually good news
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:54:41


I'm on it. Let me know when you buy a bunch then I can throw the lever back the other way so they go way back up.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:40:52
I rushed home to buy some more and now its back 590.

Well, this looks like spam. Fuck, send me your bitcoins and I'll triple them.

I'll be 15 next month you jerk!!!
@_date: 2014-06-09 02:11:54






So you do have to get electrum from the internet? I thought there was a Ubuntu distro that had it built in? That's the step I got hung up on last time I tried to do this.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:25:11
So that means you don't have to connect to the internet to install it right? That's where I got hung up last time.

@_date: 2018-04-16 15:32:51
But is the “buy” date (for long/short gains) when the fork happened or when you originally bought the BTC? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:05:15
Very long term capital gains ;) 
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:34:50
I realized gains. Paid capital gains. Was not pleasant doing the math, but I came out okay. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:37:01
You can claim 3k capital losses, not the same as itemizing deductions from income. It’s unrelated to standard deduction. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:39:06
Me too. Made a chunk of change (sold between 11-17k bwhhahahah), so Uncle Sam gets a cut. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:28:41
There’s a few places in NYC that are cashless, usually small boutique shops or coffee shops. They typically just have the iPad thing with the card dongle on it, no register.
Please relay this info the the tech capital.
