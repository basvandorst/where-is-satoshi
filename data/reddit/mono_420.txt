You will find the issue is the same when you deposit the requested amount of btc. 
Again, it’s a scam mate. Don’t be fooled from your money.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:25:44
Not at all. What is there to worry about? 
BTC going to 0? Bitch, please.
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:54:39
However, one of these days it will be the last time to get bitcoin below $10k. 
So, better buy that dip...
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:23:30
You have to deposit 0.01 btc before getting access to more btc.... 
Bruh, it’s clearly a scam.
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:23:17
1/10 BTC is more than most people in the world own.  If that’s all you can afford, what’s the issue? 
You sound like a bit of an arse, OP. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 09:17:20
The shit has yet to hit the fan. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 10:37:49
Local BTC. 
BTC atm. 
Both of the above will carry higher fees than coinbase since they are anonymous cash buys. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:27:37
It’s arse here in Scotland, pal!

There was no mention of Btrash.

Everyone wants cheap BTC, yet as BTC gets cheaper everyone complains. 
Can’t please some people.

There is nothing wrong with your ledger.

So ultimately a BITCOIN ETF is only going to benefit BITCOIN itself. 
Yes all alts may pump, but in the long run the only sensible holding is as many bitcoin as possible.

We are all well aware of this...
@_date: 2018-10-26 16:13:41
Well, y’all *wanted* adoption from large, traditional financial institutions. 
What more was to be expected?!?
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:46:58
It’s times like these one actually likes coinbase and their true fiat parings. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 07:16:55
No, there is absolutely no reason why we should see a upward spike. The trend continues. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 11:54:44
Your in the UK? 
Easiest is just to buy on coinbase. They accept direct GBP deposits now, even on weekends. 
The fees suck, and everyone loves to hate on coinbase, but it’s by far the quickest, easiest and safest way to buy BTC in the uk. 
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:28:01
You need to also be aware that direct gbp withdrawals are suspended on coinbase at the moment. 
Most UK banks now allow direct deposits, revolut is by far the best though.
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:00:44
Why don’t you tell us?
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:35:31
Buy a ledger or trezor and preload it with your crypto of choice. 
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:40:01
Hang on a second pal and I’ll just grab my crystal ball.
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:45:50
Don’t use your bank. 
Use a prepaid debit card such as revolut. 
Send funds to revolut from bank, then revolut to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:49:07
All high-street banks in the UK are anti cryptocurrency. 
Use Revolut / Barclays credit card.
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:05:11
 &gt; No KYC
Bruh, I’m yet to find a btc atm in the uk that doesn’t need to know who you are.
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:03:34
If you want paid in bitcoin and just sell it for cash. 
Why not just get paid in cash? 
It’s much easier to muddy the trail with cash than it is with bitcoin given it’s all available to see on a public ledger.
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:52:01
You need to scan a document of ID and provide a mobile phone number.
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:53:35
Revolut is the ONLY uk account that allows same day direct bank transfers in GBP. 
Be smarter dude.
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:45:00
Local Bitcoins if you want anonymity. 
Crypto ATM if you don’t mind higher fees for less know your customer. 
Revolut to coinbase if you want simplicity.

There hasn’t been any confirmation of the blockchain forking to two different coins. 
I wouldn’t fomo into BCH if you didn’t buy low a few months ago.

Would love to get me some sub £1k bitcoin(s). 
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:08:15
That’s just retarded. 
No one holds up past 20k then sells now ��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-11-18 12:42:19
You should have been keeping an accurate ledger of your crypto accounts. 
Detailing purchase value in GBP against the value of the crypto. The trading pairs. Profit / loss at sale or trade and a regular holding balance. 
We ain’t here to do your accounting for you. Never mind the fact that capital gains is different for everyone anyway. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 11:56:44
Upvoted because you don’t tell me what to do!
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:57:06
I don’t see where anyone called them an idiot... butt-hurt doesn’t imply stupidity, it suggests that someone is unhappy with the current outcome of the situation. 
I personally believe that we are still in the very early stages of growth, so even if they bought at all time high, I’m sure that in years to come they will realise a nice profit. The issue is though, people don’t have any patience, thus, they are butt-hurt. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:01:20
Interesting. That’s the kind of positivity we need in these dark times. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 08:54:55
I don’t see why withdrawing from an exchange to a private wallet would have any impact on the overall price...
@_date: 2018-11-10 15:21:01
British so can confirm : Bitcoin is advertised on the news, it’s mentioned in TV adverts, shown on sides of busses, even the Queen talks about it!

Scared money don’t make money. 
If you can afford to repay the loan, I’d say the risk is well worth it. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:16:09
If the card isn’t in your name then that’s fraud, so no, nowhere will or should accept ‘your’ money. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:41:23
Haha, not everyone’s portfolio is in the red my dude. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 11:55:15
Have you completed all the know your customer verification on coinbase? 
I’m in the UK and my high street bank will not allow any deposits to coinbase, however I can make same day  gbp deposits and withdrawals using a revolut card. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:56:10
I use revolut in the uk to deposit and withdraw money from coinbase. 
Send pounds to your revolut app, and in the app convert the pounds to euros. 
Send the Euros to coinbase (making sure to add the reference number each time) Even if you don’t want to deposit you need to send around 10 Euros to verify the revolut account on coinbase so you can withdraw. 
Buy your crypto etc etc. 
When withdrawing, sell crypto for Euros on coinbase and withdraw Euros to your revolut app. Then convert Euros to pounds in revolut app and either use revolut to withdraw cash, or send the pounds to your bank account. 
Coinbase charge quite a fee. Roughly £12 per £100 withdrawn, but it’s still less than the banks fee for international payments. 
Simple :)
@_date: 2018-11-09 16:15:34
Not sure. 
I withdrew some ETH to ledger last week and it was held for 72 hours. I figured it was the size of the withdrawal. 
I withdrew a larger value (3x) worth of BTC to ledger today and it moved within the hour. 
I’m presuming you have bought the BTC with funds that have already cleared?  
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:03:49
Try thousands of BTC to be able to effectively manipulate the market. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:05:37
Exactly! 
Pretty much sums up the whole crypto world. 
Lambo :)

 ‘Moon’
Sure, the other ideas are cool too... but lambo. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:26:28
I’m not too sure what your aiming to do. 
If you want to send fiat currency to a crypto exchange then all you need is a card in your name. 
Coinbase will be happy to accept any prepaid card, or a credit, or debit card. You just need to verify your ID and have the card in your name. 
To withdraw you need to have verification and linked bank account or prepaid card. 
There is also local bitcoins or bitcoin atms if you want to be anonymous or illegal. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:35:39
You mean ‘bullshit’ ?

@_date: 2018-02-02 20:03:33
Almost a good time to buy. Looks like it will keep dropping some more before we meet resistance. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:18:32
If BTC reaches 70k I’m out.
My hands ain’t that strong to hold past that

@_date: 2018-07-11 19:15:24
The fiat money you deposited hasn’t cleared yet. So coinbase ain’t giving you BTC you’ve purchased as you’ve not actually purchased it until the funds are cleared. 
I’m not sure what part of that you were struggling with...
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:44:17
Ain’t nothing wrong with wanting to make money, my dude. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:00:20
Use LTC, it’s instant. 
Use coinbase for fiat to LTC transaction, and send LTC from coinbase to binance. 
Then either exchange LTC back to BTC or keep LTC and send from binance to wherever you want. 
Why do coinbase make you wait 28 days to transfer your BTC? It’s always been instant for me. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:14:19
I look at BTC in terms of value against GBP (£) as that’s my local currency. Others will look at BTC agains USD or Euro etc. 
I look at alt coins in terms of value against BTC, as it’s their satoshi value that’s most important. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:11:18
Weak hands jumping ship left right and centre. And here I am watching someone make $600k in two hours buying 21k LTC at $100 and selling at $130.

Why do people not understand that an ETF is only going to attract investors when there is a high probability of the value increasing. 
I wouldn’t put money into the stock market every month (which I do via ETF) if I didn’t think the value would increase.
