Don't forget to register with homeland security  as a bitcoin user.
Failure to register is very serious.

Pretty scary.
The irony is that if there is ever some catastrophic weakness in the dollar, as has happened in many, many other countries, there will be unrest and bitcoin would/will serve as a leveling mechanism to minimize problems until the economy was sorted out.
Does the dollar have any concerns going forward? Who knows. But if history is worth anything the government should be encouraging people to diversify a bit, for its own sake i.e., for the govt's sake.

I guess being a certified massage therapist probably will get you access to some fresh info, but you should provide some insight into what you are basing your comment on.
Is there a technical pattern on one or another exchange that shows a bottom?
Already the charts have been ridiculously skewed by information pumped out of the Chinese Bitcoin Insider Trading Price Manipulation division of their ministry of money.

Point is that it is not that the Chinese are acting on their own. It is a collaborative effort of numerous governments and they are playing their part.

Sebacls you are ignoring an important element in the equation. A few years ago the Chinese premier suggested to then sec of state Hillary Clinton a global currency to solve various problems. She publicly dismissed the idea as silly.
Digital currency has been on the minds of strategy oriented thinkers since at least the 70s. To suppose that govt bureaucrats are caught off balance is silly.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
