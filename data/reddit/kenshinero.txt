Because Monero is by far the hardest coin to track.

Very bullish news for Monero and friends.

Love the idea of having a "meme wall" :)

To be honest, 2% seems quite a lot to me :-/

There are "plans" to improve privacy in the future, but I don't see it happening soon and smoothly (I expect a lot if forks as different parties will push for different solutions).
Existing solutions (Coinjoin and Wasabi) are not satisfying. 
(a satisfying solution would have all transactions private by default, without having to take any step by the user)
For now, just be patient, or use other coins specialized in privacy.

Wow, Monero is really on another level in term of privacy.
@_date: 2019-09-18 12:38:34
So Bitcoin is not considered private enough to require delisting?
@_date: 2018-07-09 04:57:13


The only answer: using Bitcoin is bad privacy practice.
If you need privacy (who does not need privacy?) use a cryptonote based coin.

Apparently, no Lambo for sale at that time, so no wonder...

Nowadays, I only play table games or board games. Table games make for fun times spent with friend. Board games (that belong to no company) can be played competitively online.

Imagine your company decide to pay all employees in BTC.
Sounds great!
But then you realize that this way you can  more easily find out everybody's salary. A small company (where this would most likely happen first) makes it very easy to guess that information.
When your direct reports can see how much you make, this is becoming quite annoying :(

I guess it's possible to withdraw directly from an exchange directly to a separated address, or even directly to the employee's address. But then, beeing forced to use an exchange as intermediate somehow defeat the purpose of BTC to be your own bank, no?


Unfortunately, that's just not true :(
LN is a great tech in many aspects, but improve nothing in term of privacy :(


That's probably part of the problem yes. Still, there are plenty of situation where I would not be happy to have the opposite party knowing exactly my account balance.
e.g. when you have to monthly negotiate a price with a supplier or a customer.

Why that? I would say the efficiency is very close to 100%
Although it's still lower than heat pump, it's still decent.

That's more a clarification of what fiscal rules should apply to crypto's. Formerly, gain would have been taxed up an unreasonable 65%, and now it is made clear that crypto are normal assets, and crypto gains will be taxed up to a more reasonable 36.5% (still high).
And that's in the case of a normal hodling behaviour: you buy, and some time later you sell. For daily trading, other ruleset apply.

I am really interested to learn about this, do you have some links to share?
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:28:28
Who is that Nouriel guys? how is this related to bitcoin or hodling? (genuine question)

Is there a wallet with blacklist feature? Like a text file with a list of blacklisted address, and the wallet automatically quarantine the coins having transited from those address?
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:23:20
Is it possible to add a blacklist feature in to quarantine coin coming from certain address? Like a text file with a list of blacklisted address, and maybe the date of starting of the ban. Then Wasabi will automatically quarantine coins that have transited through those wallet after the specified date?
