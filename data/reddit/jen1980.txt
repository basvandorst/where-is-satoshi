True, but at the volume they're buying, they are most likely forced to buy whatever they can get their hands on which means they're probably buying more expensive and less efficient equipment.

Tiger Direct's CS is crap, but at least they ship faster than amazon.com.  The last few times I ordered from amazon.com, they took almost a week to ship then shipped to Seattle from Harrisburg, PA.  It typically takes 12-14 days total to receive your order, and the office where I ship to is a block from amazon.com's new building in South Lake Union Seattle.  Twelve days to make it a block away makes me look stupid in front of my boss so I no longer order from them.

You think it's reasonable to charge a huge extra fee to not have a long delay before shipping and to not ship from the other side of the country?  I'm sorry, but when I order something in stock from a local company, and it takes 13 days to get here, that is not acceptable.

That's not why the Republicans made them illegal.  They were a good source of revenue for small business owners so the Republicans decided to destroy that.  The first restaurant I worked in had one until the Republicans passed the law in our state and then sent their thugs in blue to destroy the machine.  The packs were $3.25, and customers would usually let me keep the $0.75 change if I went to get a pack for them.  It was a great source of tips which is why those rich people hate those machine.

My Bitcoin order shipped the same day.  That is so much better than my last few amazon.com orders that took almost a week to ship.  Also, amazon.com shipped from Harrisburg, PA so it took another seven days for shipping with UPS ground.  As long as I have Bitcoins, I will order from Tiger Direct instead of amazon.com.

They currently sell for $127.60 and buy for $106.95.  There's not many traditional financial services that can make that nearly 20% profit like that.  If they're successful with that, expect a lot more businesses like them to spring up.

I disagree.  If Google wanted to, they could very quickly be competitive.  I paid $120 for my 7850 and get 300 M H/s with it.  I assume Google could get a better price in bulk.  Considering I read that Google is adding 10k servers per month, in a year they could have 36 T H/s (300M * 120,000 servers).  That's 0.5% of the total current hash rate for only $100 additional per server cost.
