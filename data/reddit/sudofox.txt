I believe the 'duplicable' nature he's referring to has to do with the fact that you can't copy-paste bitcoins to make more of them.

on the page they linked, it seems you pay 0.01 BTC for source/binaries... did they really shell out that much for a quick article? I sure hope not.

**Technical Info**
Domain: biockchaln . info
Site is running on a cPanel/WHM server. 
Hostname of server: gains.arrowbigapps.com
Server has self-signed service SSL for main hostname.
Domain is using same server as nameservers. Server has multiple IPs attached.
    biockchaln . info.	14400	IN	A	198.15.116.243

Server most likely has CSF enabled with aggressive LFD settings as I was quickly blocked without even making any login attempts.
Surprisingly WHOIS data does not have WHOIS protection. I removed some of the blank fields.

A perspective about bumping tickets in any situation that involves livechats/calls: (although yes, from the info you provided in this post, I feel like you went an appropriate route):


I work in tech support and understand his reply. I have a canned response that I sometimes have to pull out. Two techs working on the same server/issue never works out too well; it simply means more communication between technicians which slows things down.


I don't pull this out on the first time...but there are some people who will like 'bump', 'accelerate', 'prioritize', and so on, their tickets.
Again, from what info you've provided in the post I feel like you had an appropriate response here. I just like to share perspectives from a support agent from time to time.

They'll be able to filter out the bogus ones with a few simple regular expressions.
Generate bulk valid keys and addresses if you want to do this.
