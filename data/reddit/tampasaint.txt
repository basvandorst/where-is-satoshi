Not talking about passive investments.  Yes, I make more than 10% on my investments, from real estate rentals to a medium sized business.  So do most investors I know.  Central banks, by the way, aren't evil actors with a hidden agenda.  The rates were suppressed in a time of global crisis in at attempt to save the world.  They are now trying to figure out how to gently extricate themselves.

OP is correct its just happy talk.  Only an idiot thinks bitcoin in its present form is suitable for a nation's treasury.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:33:56
The effect of interest rates is overblown.  If I can find a good investment I think will return 10% I don't really care whether I'm borrowing at 2.5% or 2.75%.  
In the past rates have been raised too rapidly - thats what is causing the fear.
Once the rates are raised expect a huge market relief rally.

Curious where you get that idea.  He earned a doctorate in jurisprudence and passed the bar exam.

This is an outside group supporting him - not Joe himself.  
Joe is an example of the finest in America.  A regular guy who took the train to work until he became Vice President.  Because he is not in bed with big money donors he will never be president and isn't running.

The bond market is pretty rational.  The reason the values of US treasury bonds have soared is that the investors still look at the US as a good bet.  Among other things, the market still sees in the US:
- Stable political system
- "Relatively" low debt
- Business friendly laws
- On the way to energy independence
- Home of most of the worlds top corporations
So while these are challenging times, there is still plenty of time to make the course corrections needed in the US.
That said, in the next decade that will change.  As the boomers retire the health and retirement costs will overwhelm the treasury.  If we don't see the necessary reforms by then you will indeed see the bond vigilantes start to attack the notion of US treasury bonds being a safe investment.
But right now, the US deficit for this year has plummeted.  And there is a window of a couple more years like that before it all starts going to shit.

I'm very familiar with the landing page theory you refer to.  But its also well known that offering alternative payments if done right can increase collections.  Of course once you have a set of eyeballs on the "Enter your Card number here" page you don't want any distractions or non-conversions.  The secret is to offer it *way* earlier than that. 
Keep you coinbase account.  All this talk of maintaining your own wallet and such is really not appropriate for a commercial or fundraising account.  You can sweep your BTC daily into dollars so there really is minimal currency risk or default risk by coinbase.
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:10:39
Well coinbase doesn't ask what you want BTC for so I don't think you need to.  There are many reasons he might not want a record of his transactions.  He might be in a situation contemplating divorce.  He might have a large lawsuit and judgment hanging over him.  He might want a secret fund for his girlfriend on the side.  In any case I wouldn't trade with someone who specifically told me the coin was for some illegal purpose; otherwise I wouldn't worry about it.

My understanding is they have some kind of deal with Amazon and are working on a deal with Best Buy.  I read about it in some investor forums and the buzz seemed positive.  I'll see if they have anything I'm looking to buy right now and also post my experience.  Its a penny stock, only trading for .17.  Normally I shy away from pennies as they are dodgy but what the hell I bought some.

In qt I have 5 receive transactions and one send.  In my transaction list they all show received at the address I expect.  I'm aware (but confused about) the multiple addresses qt uses for change, but how would I display them in my wallet if the missing change is held by other addresses?

I've had a "checkbook IRA" for a while.  Basically my IRA owns an LLC of which I am the manager.  So I can write checks and buy anything not specifically disallowed by the IRS (such as collectibles and insurance).
So far I have used it only to invest in real estate, stocks, and bonds.
While the LLC could certainly buy bitcoin, you have to keep careful separation of assets and not co-mingle with your personal property.  The rules are not complex but between the expense of a lawyer in setting everything up and the potential accounting and compliance difficulty its not for everybody.

I'd second that.  Although there is a slight risk with anything, I feel good about keeping medium sized balanced at coinbase.  I wouldn't keep my IRA funds there just yet or anything that would bankrupt me.  For newcomers its a good place to start.  Its a US company based in California, the heaviest regulated state in the US, with well known venture capitalists behind it.  Totally different from the magical tux guy who ran gox like his personal fort.
Edit: I run my own wallet on a secured linux workstation but I am just saying that you are more likely to loose your own wallet than to have coinbase take you down in my opinion. (until you *thoroughly* understand everything)

I use multibit and I'm not the slightest bit worried.
I have one wallet and one address.  Just back up the private key, in addition to the wallet file.
Any product with hundreds of thousands of downloads - or millions if you believe their numbers - will have use cases that are shocking.
If you are worried, install multibit on a second machine.  Import your private key or wallet and verify it works.  Unless you add any new addresses you are good for 1000 years.
You are FAR more likely to loose your coins because your PC is compromised which is a different story.
Bottom line - bitcoin is not "stored" in your wallet.  Only your keys are.  Have a good, tested backup and you will be fine.

Its a reasonable question ; there is kernel of truth to this argument.  Lots of programmers fuck up the scalability thing on their first cut.  Think Y2K because COBOL programmers only allowed 6 digits.  Or more currently, IP4 is too small and eventually we will have to move to IP6.  In none of these cases did the users say "ok we'll close it down".  Same with bitcoin.  There are lots of obvious solutions.  Off-block chain transactions (coinbase does this now) are one.  Or maybe we partition the blockchain into chunks so it scales infinitely.  A solution will be found.   But if history is any guide not till we start to see the date we bump into the limits.

You had be interested until you threw the TSA under the bus.  I fly frequently with my family and when somebody says they are "opposed to the TSA" that scares the crap out of me - it means you are willing to take screwball positions in order to appeal to the clueless.

To follow your logic you'd have to decentralize the military too.  Each neighborhood would have its own militia.  We'd be exactly like Somalia.  Its no coincidence that countries with the highest taxes (think places like Sweden and Canada) have the richest citizens, the lowest crime, and the most people wanting to get in.  I just don't get the logic.  Taxes used to be MUCH higher in the US.

No SD card here on my nexus 5.  And yeah for years I have entered an alphanumeric passphrase each and every time I unlock my phone.  Its a slight pia but you get used to it quickly.  So I'm really happy with the android encryption as it exists.  I travel occasionally to third word countries where pickpockets are rampant and there is no other way I'd be comfortable.  The only real way to hack into the phone is to leave it on... but most thieves will instantly power off the phone to avoid being tracked... after that its would prove almost impossible to get my data.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:47:16
Thanks that was the answer I was looking for.  I understood some change was coming back to different addresses but it never occurred to me that the qt client would not show those addresses.
I guess my takeaway is that as long as I keep current backups of my encrypted wallet I don't need to worry about it.  I did read there are only 100 addresses in it so to periodically make a new backup.

It's a very exiciting time to be a libertarian / voluntaryist / agorist / market anarchist!
I'd drop that sentence.  Most of the people that I talk to HATE bitcoin and won't even listen because they think its is some sort of a right wing anti-government libertarian thing,  And while maybe that is true for some, certainly not for me or any of my friends.  Bitcoin just is.  You don't need to plug in a political philosophy to use it.
Edit: Sorry I missed that this is geared towards a certain audience.
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:06:52
I think this article is way off the mark.  Of course Bitcoin is going to be subject to the same "clawback" provisions as any other currency.  If you sell me a stolen car and I pay in Bitcoin, and that case ends up in civil court, any US judge is going to order you to return my Bitcoin.  So while there may be no recourse built into the protocol, there certainly will be recourse in the courts. &lt;yawn&gt;

While I have no reason to doubt the  OP I would need more details and to see coinbase's eventual response before making up my mind.  They have been great for me.  My trades are instant up to $1K.

Well I have two different answers I need a tiebreaker, lol.  But my question is not whether to use multibit or not I have already made that decision.  My question is whether it uses only one address per wallet. (In which case one private key export is sufficient, and multiple machines are ok).  I am seeing conflicting answers on that but my google searches seems to confirm - no - only one address.
@_date: 2014-03-17 13:52:36
Its very easy but does take some work.  What I did was start a self directed IRA with "checkbook control" over an LLC.  This was done with the aid of a lawyer and a trustee.  You end up with an LLC that you control and have a checkbook for.  You have to be meticulous and careful following the rules.  Once you have that structure you can invest in pretty much anything not specifically excluded by the IRS.  So far I have bought houses I rent out and stocks.  I don't see anything wrong with investing 5% of your retirement in bitcoin but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

Why is BitPay's right to freedom any less important than the gun shop?  There are lots of business reasons why you wouldn't want certain items (pot, firearms, etc) on your records even though they are legal.  The gun guy clearly broke his contract and tos don't cry about it then find a new processor or roll your own.  I'm a gun owner and not against owning them but BitPay is a business they can do what they like.

True, but it solves a problem I don't have.  Since used properly I have a zero percent chance of loosing my money with Multibit (other than a hack which can never be zero percent) I see no need to migrate just yet.
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:42:03
Agreed... but for a typical bitcoin user like me there is a zero percent chance of losing money that way.  Having backed up my private key once, it will not change or need backing up again because the default Multibit install does not use a change address or have any more private keys.
I won't use Electrum because of its reliance on a third party's servers, but I am eagerly awaiting the release of Multibit HD which is a deterministic wallet.
The OP was asking how to secure his wallet, and hopefully he has some advice on that now. :-)

I'd be careful with that last takeaway.  Lots of people  avoided Amazon, Microsoft, and Google for YEARS because, like, right, they were already at the moon?

The client uses upnp, correct, so in most cases you do not need to open any ports on your router.  That said, I disabled upnp on my router because it gave me the creeps that any program I install can take control of my router and open holes without me knowing about it.  I'm so paranoid that in addition to turning off upnp I also turned Ubuntu firewall on as an additional barrier.

I don't think its ever advisable to run qt on a home machine.  I did for a while but stopped.  The reason is that you are advertising your ip address.  I figure that hackers with a long term frame of mind will harvest those ip adresses and make a special attempt to break in to your computer whether it takes a week or 2 years.  Most isps these days preserve your address for a very long lease time I wish mine would change daily.

Yawn yeah the case has nothing to do with bitcoin.  Substitute any other currency and it would still be a crime.

The best way to understand public key encryption is that its a one way trip.  I can publish my public key on the internet, bathroom walls, etc.  And yet never in a million years can you discover my private key.  However you can use my public key to test if messages came from someone who possesses the private key.

Read what I said more carefully.  I said the TSA offers an "increase" in security.  Not absolute.  And the terrorists were not well funded.  They were not pilots, and would not have been able to rent large commercial sized private jets.  So yeah they can maybe launch a Cessna some day, but for right now the idea of disbanding the TSA is just insane.
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:08:42
I don't think that is always true.  I never opened port 8333 and I always had 30-40 nodes connected and was listed in blockchain.info as the first confirm on many transactions.  Websites report that port open even though it isn't.  I think newer versions of qt use UPnP on your router which opens up connections without you doing anything.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:52:44
At least one more.  But yeah most people I mention Bitcoin to are immediately and openly hostile because of its Libertarian connotation.  In the US anyway the Libertarian mantle has been hijacked by the far right and is pushing a philosophy not actually libertarian at all, hence the extreme hostility.  I don't know how to get past that when I mention Bitcoin their eyes go red and they don't hear after that.

Wow terrible story.  Phishing attacks are incredibly effective I was attacked by a fake Ebay site once and fell for it.  I agree that ip address based security should be integrated into their system, although people should be able to opt out while travelling or using tor or whatever.  I checked my coinbase account just now and 2FA was only enabled for withdraws over $100 - which would allow a "test" withdraw to go unoticed so I changed it to all.

In the US anyway most Libertarians I see on TV who embrace that term (example the Pauls) are not what I consider Libertarian at all because they bundle that with some right wing views like anti-choice and anti gay rights.

The US government, like virtually all others, taxes capital gains (and currency trading gains for that matter) on virtually everything with a few exceptions.  Nobody in their right mind would have expected that Bitcoin gains wuld not be taxable.  All the IRS did was clarify the rate (which is what most tax attorneys assumed it would be all along anyway).
Sure, lots of people don't declare their taxable income, and some get away with it.
Edit: Also, I think its a huge mistake to think that the majority of bitcoin adopters want to "move away" from the currency system.  Lot of us see it (bitcoin) as a complementary currency offering huge advantages for some transactions but it certainly won't displace money and gold in total.

There are currently no other cryptos meriting serious consideration in my opinion.  None has the market cap of bitcoin, and none likely too because there are mostly "me-toos".
Now that said, there may come a time in the coming years, when a superior cypto emerges.  It would have to be vastly superior to bitcoin, but even then, that presupposes that bitcoin wouldn't evolve.  Even if that happened I can see an orderly transition, occurring over time...

Actually I am a pilot too, or more accurately I was, but I haven't flown in many years.
The terrorists that flew on 9/11 knew only rudimentary maneuvers.  They would not have been able to rent a commercial size jet or take off in one.
Osama Bin Laden boasted publicly that it was a cheap operation - if I recall about a million dollars.  That is not enough to hire real pilots and lease a large passenger jet.  You can't just rent large commercial jets with the funding and people that he had available.
And again - you are completely missing the point.  Lets agree that a middle eastern terrorist, willing to invest, say, 20 million dollars, might be able to start a small company in the US and lease a plane and get real pilots.  Agreed.
But why lower the price tag and give him the same capability with 2 tickets on a $99 southwest flight?
I fly weekly, and never found the TSA anything but polite and efficient.  If we didn't have them we'd have a 9/11 monthly and commercial aviation would be non-existent in the US.

Not really.  Lastpass doesn't have your master password.  Even if it got compromised they would still be unable to use it without also cracking through 2 factor authentication by lastpass.
Bottom line = lastpass makes it trivial and convenient to use a unique 18 character password at every site.
Keeping 18 characters in sticky notes in a cold storage vault underground is arguably more secure, but you are less likely to actually do it.
Edit: I forgot to mention I only use Ubuntu.  If I did use windows I would probably keep passwords offline in a paper notebook.

That said, I am not an active day trader so I hold most of my coin in my own wallet.

I tell friends who are just starting out to get an account at coinbase.com  Its an online service like paypal and is US based with US investors backing it and located in San Francisco, CA - the most heavily regulated state in the US. 
Is it 100% "safe"?  Hell no.  They claim to have their reserves offline but that doesn't mean its safe.  Their offline coin is not 100% secure as its still subject to an inside job or a hacker that discovers a flaw in the system.
But I would maintain that for most average users lacking Unix and networking skills you are more likely to loose coins on your own pc than you are with coinbase.

Is your wallet strongly encrypted with a complex password?  If so, in theory you could post leave it in Times Square and it would be somewhat secure.
I like multiple levels of security though, so I use Google drive for pictures of my kids, not sensitive information. 
While google has a good record, its too juicy a target and your data is stored in plaintext at google.
So I use spideroak for storing sensitive data in the cloud.  They are not able to view your data since its encrypted with a key only you know.
As a bonus spideroak has a ubuntu client while google doesn't.

Most important thing is to encrypt your phone.  Very few people know that that this has been available on android for a long time.  And DO NOT root or mod it.

Of course Bitcoin will be taxed its a dumb question.  The only question is whether you will owe taxes only after you sell for fiat (mostly in the US that is the assumption) or eventually someday if its treated like a currency perhaps earlier.
Of course I assume some Bitcoin millionaires will decide to try to evade taxation.  But consider that thousands of people for years thought their Swiss accounts were safe from the IRS and that turned out not to be true.   Just google "Wesley Snipes" to find out what happens when you evade taxes for years.

I think Multibit is exceptionally reliable.  There are reports of certain circumstances people loosing funds with just about any program.  People who lost money with Multibit mostly had very specialized circumstances like a very large number of private keys, confusion about change addresses, etc.  Thats no excuse for loosing data but not likely to effect you.
If you just take a fresh install of Multibit and only have one wallet, there are a couple things you can do:
- From the tools menu,  export private keys.  Be sure to password protect the file.  If you do not create new wallets that file will be all you ever need because Multibit by default does not use change addresses so it shouldn't ever change unless you create new wallets or import private keys.
- In your home directory you should have a directory named "Multibit".  I backup up that whole directory because its tiny, under 4 megs and contains your data and logs.
- Be sure your wallet is encrypted.

Password security is measured differently with bitcoin because attackers have their own blockchain.  A typical bank will disable the account after 3 or 4 password guesses.  You really don't need a very secure password at all.
A brute force bitcoin attack doesn't involve any third parties at all.  The attacker can run billions of combinations on his own network with nobody being the wiser.  For that reason even some word combinations that might seem secure really aren't.
That said, I think most attackers would only mount such an attack on a larger stash of bitcoins than yours.  It would be more cost effective. :-)

&lt;Yawn&gt;  99% of people holding bitcoin aren't particularly concerned about privacy.  I have accounts at Bank of America and Chase, and they both sell that information to the highest bidder daily.  What the paper talks about at most is discovering an ip address.

Its pretty easy to loose a wallet copying it to different computers.  That said, Multibit is one of the simplest and safest wallets.  It does not generate mass addresses like qt  but uses a single address.
My strategy has been:
- password encrypt the wallet with a secure password
- have a zero knowledge service like spideroak or tresorit set to backup the multibit directory automatically.
- Export the private keys to a password protected export file, which is also backed up.
I figure if my hard disk takes a dump I have the wallet directory backed up as well as the private key.
Recently I upgraded to a SSD drive and simply copied the whole Multibit directory over and everything was still there and fine.
EDIT:  Just to clarify you can create multiple wallets with Multibit and you can import extra addresses, but if you just create one wallet and send and receive until the end of time you will only have one address and if you save the one private key you can always recover your wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:24:22
Psa: Spideroak is not zero knowledge if you use a mobile app or their webpage.  So keep it synchronized on your desktop using spideroak installed.  Assuming the wallet is already encrypted it seems a safe way to go.

I'm a complete noob.  Over the past week I bought at coinbase where I had a very good experience.  But I wanted my own wallet so I tried blockchain.info which also worked out just fine.  Finally I tried bitcoin-qt.
I immediately preferred bitcoin-qt.  Yes, it did take almost a whole day to grab the database which is 15 gig, but after that it worked just fine and peachy.  Choose a password and encrypt your wallet, then throw a backup copy on spideroak, and its about as secure as you can get as long as you don't forget your password.
My preference for bitcoin-qt is that its the original reference program, and no reliance on registration with a third party.
I found for a noob bitcoin-qt is very simple and reliable, albeit slow and ugly.

The ransoms are usually quite cheap, and as others have said, if you pay you will likely get your files back.  
It happened to one of old windows servers a few months ago.  The best approach is to reformat the drive, re-install the OS and applications, and only restore from backup data unlikely to contain a virus, such as a database for example.  Thats what we did.
Just restoring a recent backup isn't really a good idea as there is no guarantee that's not compromised too.

I used to have a moderately large website that was based on a subscription model.  I can confirm absolutely that people who "forget" their subscription are part of the revenue stream and we would have never have even remotely considered any alternative billing that compromised that.
Some people would go years without using accounts, until the card expired or they died.
There is though one easy solution.  Offer a prepaid year through bitcoin, at a slight discount (say 10%).  Both parties come out way ahead, and that's a long enough period to offset the "dead customer" bonus revenue.

No, I think your concept was right, just not the execution. :-) 
In sales its considered a truth sales take multiple efforts before the deal closes.  So if you offer a bitcoin payment and a modest 2% discount that reinforces the message that its a valid and cheaper way to pay.

I'm really liking this software.  
I pretended I somehow managed to loose my password and both the primary and backup wallets.  Using a laptop, I recreated the wallet from my seed words.
The first try was a failure because the menus were a bit confusing and apparently I chose the wrong recovery.  After entering the seed words I was told no password recovery was possible or something to that effect.
The second try worked like a charm.  After entering the seed words, and the time from my paper backup, it was accepted and I chose a new password for the local wallet.
After a few minutes of synchronizing I had the whole wallet back on my laptop, including transaction history.
One question I have for anybody that knows the answer - what would happen if I started spending (or sending to) the laptop?  My assumption is that while the "real" wallet cache may fall out of synch, due to the nature of HD wallets I could use either computer for receiving and sending without every putting my bitcoin in jeopardy.
Second question - where does the seed word list come from?  While 12 words sounds like a lot of entropy, if its from a predetermined dictionary each word could be considered like an integer key, creating the possibility of a hacker generating a sort of "rainbow table" to bruteforce an address.
I'm curious why this is not the case?

I think a lot of people should learn a little about common law, the basis for law in many western democracies.  For example, you cannot sell or transfer something you don't own.
Let's say while your neighbor is snoozing you sell his car on craigslist.  The guy that bought it from you, although totally innocent, absolutely can be compelled to return it as he doesn't own anything.  Title is still with your neighbor.

I'm a previous porn site owner.  I had about 1000 paying members, produced all the content myself, and did very well with it until selling out about 8 years ago.
Here is the real deal:  Porn has been slow to adopt Bitcoin because of the lack of a recurring payment system. (I know there are some simulated ones like coinbase has but its not the same)  Credit card recurring is the gold standard of the porn industry.
My site was a super quality site, with no wish to snag people into recurring charges they didn't want.  But even for sites like mine "forgotten" recurring billing was a major income producer.  People who never logged in had memberships going for months or years.
For less quality sites, its practically the only real avenue of revenue.
Porn sites despise credit cards because of the high fees, but also because its so difficult to get a merchant account to process porn.  Most of them go through some outfit like CCBill that charges even higher fees and you are possibly leaking your customer list to third parties.
Its all about the recurring billing.  If Bitcoin had such a feature 99% of porn would be sold that way.
