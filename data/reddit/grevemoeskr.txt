That is a governmental issue. That has nothing to do with fiat currency itself. The US Treasury has to print money in order to make the payments that the US Congress has forced it to pay. If it didn't, the US would constantly face a fiscal cliff

Exactly. And it won't stabilize unless people stop seeing it as an Investment and start seeing it as a currency
@_date: 2014-11-29 22:40:00
How so?
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:03:02
Is there any proof to back that up? I mean, if that was true, that'd be a huge pro for Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-10-12 13:39:42
This feels too much like the struggle we went through on Watch for it on Yahoo Screen

That's kind of a given. The more people that denotes their price in bitcoins, the more stable bitcoins will be. Since the price of stuff in fiat currency has been, more or less, decided over 100 years by consumers, we know that 1 liter of milk=1 USD. The more places that accept bitcoin, the more people will 1. be aware of bitcoin and 2. get a feeling of their value.

Best bet? "15.000 grand", plus 1%.
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:09:07
To my defense, I said there was a 7% chance. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:08:21
No. I can't see any of the previous havings by eyeballing the charts on WolframAlpha, so I can't estimate the effects
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:43:34
Nah. I haven't gotten my model checked by somebody who actually knows how it should work. Then again, my call option prices weren't that far off the Black-Scholes prices, so the model should work
@_date: 2016-01-25 23:05:57
Did you see the first plot, right? It went from something like 330 to 500 in a month. Is that not a moon shot?. And I used data from the last 365 days, meaning I have all of October 2015 in. Which is when the price went from 237 to 312 and continued to 408 on November 4th. Is that not a moonshot? 
And if you aren't convinced there is moonshots in my simulation [this]( gives me 2 or 3, depending on how you count the two around day 100
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:46:57
Danish comma, yo
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:08:04
Yeah, but notice that the first 40.000 simulations all put the price at under 500.
@_date: 2016-01-10 11:57:27
Assuming, of course, you look at Bitcoin as an investment rather than a currency. A currency should be relatively stable, since that means you always know how much your money can buy. When your currency loses or gains 5% relative to other currencies almost each day, knowing how much a liter of milk costs gets pretty hard. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:45:56
Wait, that was a bot? Probably should have known. I've posted once or twice in here, and I got a pm from it
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:24:03
I didn't mean for this to be a be-all, end-all analysis, but rather a base line estimate.
Also, you say "supply constraint" as if it isn't already. The supply of Bitcoin is at all times vertical. The only thing that changes is that over time, demand changes. And I'm not convinced that the halving changes anything. It don't seem like it has to me
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:40:53
And yes. But that's just because that we can apply the Central Limit Theorem and assume the profits each day is normally distributed
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:00:01
Just in the interest of completeness, [this]( is a sorted plot of the price on 31 December. The average price is 402,64 USD with a standard deviation of 219,8629
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:58:19
No, I've assumed each day is independent of the day before. And the model is still a work in progress. I'm going to incorporate the brownian motion later. Maybe that gives different results
@_date: 2016-06-24 12:39:16
Then again, this recent 100% rally in a couple of days is not really what you'd expect from a normal asset. The months before that, with low volatility, I agree, but I'm not so sure now
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:38:23


Well, that's just wrong. The thing about Bitcoin, as you know is that it's value is really volatile. I believe that wolfram have the annualized volatility above 100%. What that means is that if any country unilaterally move to a Bitcoin based economy is that the value of imports and exports will vary enormously from day to day. That makes it less desirable to trade with the outside world, which, as we all know, is horrible for growth
