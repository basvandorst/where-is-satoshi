I invested in ADX and it tanked. I was new to the game and had weak hands and sold at a major loss.

I have invested it into an alt coin. I am desperate to recover satoshi. All in. Either I make it or go bust. If I go bust my rope is ready in the garage. &lt;- joking

I am located in the United States. The real estate market is about to crash. Gold is too expensive.

How do I even get into bitcoin? I hear about bitcoin all the time. A friend said you have to create it with your computer and another told me you could buy it online. A bit lost here.
