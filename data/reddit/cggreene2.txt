Then that government would only protect the ones paying them, the point of a government is so that the services take care of everyone whether they contribute or not

I'd love to buy BTC, but I can't sign up on most of the legit websites, paypal on Localbitcoins is overpriced and anyway I can only buy tiny amounts. 
Would love a simple way to get bitcoin without hassle.

Billions of people would rush at the chance to give there children the chance to go to school . Also , why is it that every libertarian has to get there fist of sexism in somewhere?
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:45:19
Danm, I know its great, but it's a bit annoying, I bough some the other day and wanted to buy stuff, but now since its rising I want to keep it instead.

Can't afford more fam

This is great, it actually is pretty big for me, the BTC value is pretty volatile, so when you buy on coinbase, you really don't know how much it will be worth by the time you get it, now there is no problem for that at all.
