What is next, sending them to prison because their social credit scores were low?
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:07:49
That is the whole point of Decentralization.
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:07:38
Hahahah good one
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:08:18
It could happen in a future.
@_date: 2019-03-06 08:40:32
Hahahaha good one, never though about this one.
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:29:23
Wow, nice and the best part was that it was bought with BTC :D
@_date: 2019-03-05 03:47:29
Nice to see crypto getting more adoption.
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:27:44
Never heard of it before.
@_date: 2019-03-05 03:49:53
What took them so long? 
@_date: 2019-03-06 08:28:43
Yeah, but most of the times is for the best.
@_date: 2019-03-06 08:39:44
Mm.. It kind of looks weird but its rather convincing.
@_date: 2019-03-02 22:34:41
It an introduction, is something that happens slowly not overnight.
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:02:07
What is this?
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:26:28
Shit, I didn't knew that. Now Coinbase has been fucked up. Hopefully another one will take his place.
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:07:25
I hope they can finally integrate it! It seems like 2019 will be the year of the adoption and slowly we will keep making the market green again.
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:03:20
What took them so long? 
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:49:48
BTC and its long relationship with pizzas.
@_date: 2019-02-17 19:27:15
If the BTC network was flooded like it was on it peak, most likely the app will be back up faster than you getting your BTC's.
@_date: 2019-02-17 19:25:24
What is digital blasphemy about?
@_date: 2019-02-04 09:04:07
Cool stuff.
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:04:35
No fees O.o?
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:41:36
You definitely should do it. That piece is amazing!
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:42:00
Hope he plans to enable additional payments methods such as ETN, ETH, DGB.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:04:24
But that was nothing, try sending more.
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:51:51
So we have plenty of time to horde BTC until it skyrockets to the moon. Well, people you already have been warned to let you this opportunity slip away.
@_date: 2019-02-17 19:26:06
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:35:33
I don't if I want to click that link. Looks suspicious, can you please post the article here?
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:53:03
Hahaha good one. "Kid your bury it and get it out in 30 years and you will never have to work again."
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:43:27
I don't know, the link address didn't give me any confidence at all.
@_date: 2019-02-09 06:22:07
HODL, it we will eventually get back to green days.
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:11:57
Ofc, also it seems like Samsung Knox is more secure than what Apple offers.
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:00:49
It actually illegal, but of course all this people do this kind of trading in the black or grey market.
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:11:30
We hope so, at the moment it feels like he doesn't know what to do if to crack his neck or just do the photobomb and peacefully leave.
@_date: 2019-02-27 01:57:48
They are doing so to cause sensationalism and be on the spot of everyone. Again.
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:56:43
Great to know, but sadly I believe that bitcoin will eventually fade out. It will be the top coin but others coins will be the one that becomes useful and actually implemented in our lives.
@_date: 2019-02-17 19:17:27
Oh cool
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:28:35
But is still a freaking sexy car.
@_date: 2019-02-04 08:55:39
Bitcoin will eventually grow his skills and grab FIAT by his head. HODLLLL!
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:50:25
Man, I gotta try that. Is this US-only or I can order it anywhere?
@_date: 2019-02-17 19:28:28
So how do the markets feel right now to you?
@_date: 2019-02-04 08:45:41
Haha it does, I will definitely be checking this out. A lot of cool stuff that you have there.  I might have an idea for a shirt design if you wish to collab, DM.
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:54:44
Of course, this is just a small obstacle in the way. Big things always have their problems along the way.
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:36:19
The human leg can only see 60 FPS per hand
@_date: 2019-02-17 19:18:03
@_date: 2019-02-04 09:04:36
Yes we are slowly progressing for total world domination.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:12:18
At least this one didn't give a date like Mcafee. Seems like he will have to eat his own dick.
@_date: 2019-02-16 09:24:36
And just not so along this people plummeted BTC price, basically doing market manipulation and also elaborated a campaign to make crypto look bad.
@_date: 2019-02-17 19:30:29
I don't think we are going to to adopt BTC it will probably be another coin with a better network. Have everyone forgotten how high were BTC transaction fees and how long it took for them to arrive when the market was at its ATH, just imagine it being widely adopted it will take weeks and with so high fees that will make it absurd to even use it for daily use.
@_date: 2019-02-09 06:01:43
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:15:14
Your doctor is already preparing himself for the future.
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:45:18
Never said they are the most secure, but I just feel Samsung is more secure than Apple.
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:39:10
What? Never thought that someone could give that kind of use to a phone.
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:14:02
Well the next economic downturn is rumored to be next year and a lot of people is speculating that next year the crypto market will be bullish again.
@_date: 2019-02-02 00:01:21
We also some Local Bitcoin ATM here in my city with low fees.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:23:39
Some people just don't have any shame at all.
@_date: 2019-02-18 09:51:52
Sure, but how much money do you think is really in the market? I doubt it's $120b or whatever.
@_date: 2019-02-09 06:11:59
Why? more cryptocurrencies give more varieties and options to people at the same time more opportunities to market growth and also become more independent from BTC.
@_date: 2019-02-04 09:07:35
Just some ignorant writing...
@_date: 2019-02-04 09:08:11
Glad to see BTC start to widespread to places so remotes as Chile.
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:36:08
I am not mad at Coinbase because it can help us with adoption.
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:45:25
@_date: 2019-02-09 06:47:59
Is Mcafee going to be the next one?
@_date: 2019-02-09 05:50:29
That does the work lol
@_date: 2019-02-04 09:05:56
Get ready for the fight.
@_date: 2019-02-04 09:06:30
That's the kind of things we actually need to open it to others. Accessibility.
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:55:25
You should make this digital and sell it. Hahaha, nice touch having the dog that looks close to DOGE.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:05:54
Now this is something creative hahaha, who would have thought so?
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:53:36
To swing trade easily.
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:42:35
That's so wizardy trick of the devil!
Nowadays: Blockchain is the future ����
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:15:16
They never say it was BTC related, I guess they are only exploting what blockchain technology has to offer.
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:07:44
What were you trying to say?
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:41:27
Oh woah, the people that only read headline and not at least the first paragraph so they can understand that this was at a Crypto hedge fund and not the entire network ��‍♂️
