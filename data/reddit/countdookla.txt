The white paper of Bitcentury is in Chinese with no option to translate.  
Do you have an English version?  
Without the white paper, how would a traditional ICO/IEO investor validate the claim and see the light in adopting the SIEO model of investing in early age concepts?

Now, let's imagine, if Gold was not valued as Gold is and instead, we are living in a parallel universe where copper is pricier and Gold is dirt cheap, just because of its public image and Supply and Demand.  
The same post would be posted and only the object of reference would have changed.  
if there were no cross border regulations, Blockchain would not have flourished,  
In both these universes, unless blockchain and its tokens would not have created a significant impact, it would not have people investing it and spending resources trying to mine it.  
So, Gold, Copper, ot BTC, unless there is a supply to demand deficit, it will never reach the value mark.

Zela Coin is also in this space and I attended a conference where the CEO was very confident on they are offering BTC to fiat in ATMs across the US.  
Checked their whitepaper after that and the future projections and progress is not matching.  
What are your thoughts on this?

This was where he had spoken about it, but somehow now everything based on this seems to out in a puff.   
If guys like these are vanishing into thin air with no proper communication, what grounds would you base your next ICO on?

This sounds interesting. I specially like the fact that this platform is looking to get its users BTC instead of asking them to convert it to fiat.

There are ways of sending BTC without the intervention of a 3rd party like an exchange.   
For any transaction to get recorded on the Blockchain, it has to be put on the network stating that you wish to send X amount of BTC to a specified wallet and along with that the transaction fee you are willing to offer for that transaction to go through.  
Depending on the reward offered, miners will consider running the transaction and recording it in the network.  
Higher the reward, lesser is the time taken for the transaction to go through.  
Obviously, miners would rather spend their computational power for transactions that get them higher rewards.  
When the reward is low, it takes longer for the transaction to go through.  
Hope this helps

Looks very good. Are you a designer and would you be able to design an image from a very long narrative? The narrative will be around a person's life. His/her journey, downfalls, up highs and everything else in between.

Global executives, like the likes of Tim Draper, have always channelled their response towards Blockchain and the potential it holds when they were asked about BTC and the interviewers were smart/polite enough to let it slide.  
Same is the case with key people from Goldman and JP Morgan Chase.

True, digitization of currency was the necessity that Blockchain solved.But, if the united nations or the world bank itself came up with a universal digital currency that is accepted across governments, is not volatile and is easily accessible, the need for cryptos would not have arised.

If Cornell's study was published in 2016 and BTC has seen a flux since, it's not very long before BTC will become obsolete and new technology which is built on the framework of Bitcoin will come in, which at its core will have the resistance strain that will keep it safe from faster decryption models.  
I see this happening in less than 5 years.
