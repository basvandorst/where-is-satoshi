How is this done? Is it done through LN network? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:18:57
im sitting here hoping this shit is not true and waiting for my mother to give her second opinion but i am not bullshitting you. i dont care for convincing you anyways, you are only helping me out by commenting since I need distraction right now.
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:55:13
You don't. So if you want to gamble only do it in smaller amounts. Hodl is recommended if you want to play safe.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:37:10
This is how you get rekt.

Is Binance still down?
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:47:06
It's a show. It's always sunny in Philadelphia.

The memes are getting better &amp; better.

What if Satoshi is still alive the day BTC takes over our economy &amp; decides to crash it?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:14
Congratulations for being correct on a 50/50 guess. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:54:25
Everyone trying to use their technical analysis to predict the future surely forgot what purpose Bitcoin is serving. We were unsure of hitting 10K per BTC for 2017 and yet we almost hit double in the december craze.
Chill down and enjoy 100K later this year, sell the high and buy the crash.
Halvening @ 2020 will be brutal. 
This game is long.
Have a good day.

When Bitcoin gets  Lightning Network fully implemented for the public, we can say goodbye to cheap Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:21:16
We all know they're just trying to drive Bitcoin price down so they can accumulate as much as possible before it goes full adoption style.
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:57:30
If you can see yourself living with paying 10x the current price next year, then go ahead. But if the thought of that haunts you, maybe work around it. How crucial is it to upgrade your pc? Better than future wealth?
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:54:34
Weird weiner. It must be on my side then.

Ooh lord mighty, give us the good ol domino effect to tilt thy way to moon.

If banks were all in, you'd see atleast 1M USD per Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:33:22
I think you mean darude sandstorm
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:17:26
Is it really so bad if you have a sidechain with basically instant transactions that arn't fully decentralized? Your "wealth" aKa life savings etc will be stored safely on the mainnet while staying decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:36:50
missed the dip huh
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:28:43
Crashes create character.
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:37:43
When can we expect LN to get offical launch (like segwit)?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:52:10
Yeah, buy when it has fully recovered instead. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:42:49
For some reason I am unable to connect to Binance.com and have been for several days. Is the original domain 
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:17:55
Could you provide sauce when claiming such a disastrous statement?
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:32:42
HERD MENTALITYYYYYYY

Bottom's breached, les go!!!

Some don't want to learn or are just too busy with their lives. It's easy for them to go on with their lives without doing any type of research. 9-5 day jobs and binge drinking on weekends. They'll buy when media tells them to. So wait untill 100k or something like that.

Funny. We crashed to mid novembers all time high 2017. 
Calm down and know what you signed up for when you invest in crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:49:20
You were a noob once aswell. Don't forget to be humble unless you want to stay an asshole your whole life.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:11:22
No real evidence. Considering how big of a deal Bitcoin is and what implications it will have on the world, it can surely be staged to protect it's maker/makers.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:12:49
Truth is, Satoshi will remain a mystery for a long time or even forever.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:15:42
Underestimating Bitcoin &amp; blockchain will be the downfall of Fiat. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:21:56
Calm down and MOOON later.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:32:27
funny how these comments actually impact people
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:00:22
 Meh. Could've, should've and would've. 
Bitcoin is just preparing for the next bullrun.
Smoke some trees and learn about the tech. 
The price of Bitcoin is not what makes it fascinating. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:04:32
See you at next ATH.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:52:39
I am no expert and will thereby not claim to know what it will do. With that said, I absolutely think we hit the bottom and will continue stable growth from here on. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:47:58
I thought CME futures were closed? Please ELI5. I thought CME closing caused the major crash since the rally began a week before the opening and ended with a major correction/crash.
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:19:08
Bitcoin bear market about to turn bullish!
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:42:41
Will we see any futures at play again in the near future? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:15:00
Just check it once in the morning and once in the evening.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:37:46

No problem, friend.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:40:56
this thing? boy do I wish someone came with a lecture under this comment to explain why this is basically revolutionary. 
but you know this thing is pretty dope too.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:54:11
Wow, you're right. He/she/them or it could have good intentions. If Satoshi is even alive that is.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:54:25
This is not a stock. If you bet on altcoins you bet on somewhat centralized tokens. There is only one true decentralized currency which is Bitcoin. Untill we find new technology that allows us to recreate what we already got in a more efficient way. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:10:04
Paypal profiting from shilling Bitcoin? No. Only if the paypal exec is already invested in BTC. Bitcoin will eventually replace paypal.

Dream on. I'd sell my left nut for some extra cash if that would happen.
