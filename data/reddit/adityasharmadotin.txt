I hope the media picks this up, also, damn man.
You may not be Batman yet, but you just became Bruce Wayne with all these donations.

Wait so they can track someone this accurately from their bitcoin address, track the person who stole from nicehash.

I have been unable to withdraw anything from bittrex and they aren't even responding whether through their support or twitter. It's a sad state of affairs and the worst part is that people think it is a rare situation, if these were rare wouldn't they have enough staff to solve these issues. There are people waiting for months just for a reply.

Never buy at ATH, if you are in for short term. 
Especially in a market like Crypto which is still in early adoption, if you are going long, just buy and forget it.

Maybe they do, I just don't feel safe on local bitcoins but arbitrage opportunities are quite high.

I am new to BTC, all I was trying to find a good site to invest but all sites have different rates?
Can you enlighten me why this is?
Also, since I am trying to invest wouldn't this be a bad thing.
