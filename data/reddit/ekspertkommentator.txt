It just means that people with loads of money can trade aggressively both buying and selling. It's leveraged tools for the big guys. They never touch Bitcoin, own bitcoin, they only speculate in volatility. How this will affect the real price of Bitcoin we don't know, but teoretically whales can manipulate the BTC price and play the high stakes ETF game.

True, but for microtransactions you don't really need the level of security Bitcoin provides. That's why other cryptocurrencies are taking hold, until the day Bitcoin can provide that too with it's second layer, not so secure, not so decentralized lightning network.

It means, the high-stakes bitcoin gambling can begin.

I'v read up on the [railroad mania]( and there are so many similarities to the Crypto mania. People from everywhere trying to get a piece of the new currency infrastructure.

approximately 0.2% of the worlds population has cryptocurrency atm, and if this is the new world currency,  a lot of people will get involved in a relatively short time, just imagine if crypto has the same adaptation rate that facebook had the last decade.

No one wants to live in a non-smarthouse in the future, energy inefficient, outdated space planning, wrong locations. That is going to change in Ireland too. New better things will cost close to nothing when everything is automated, and that adaption is going to change increasingly rapid. I bet most of the extra housing in Ireland will be demolished,recycled and rebuilt.
Historically, if you bought a house you needed a decade for it to be worth the investment. Tomorrow, you wont even be able to catch up, never.

He's showing classic signs of narcissism
*Narcissistic personality disorder — one of several types of personality disorders — is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.*

I've read in the local news that people have taken huge payday loans to speculate in bitcoin. These guys are taxi drivers who barely knows how to open an account on coinbase.
That's a sign of a bubble in itself.
I'm confident cryptocurrency will disrupt the financial sector in the long term, but this rise, is purely inflated by easy money handled by greedy and financially incompetent people. 
The ride to the moon will indeed be bumpy.

**Thanksgiving discussion:**
*It's going higher, you should buy some*
*Yeah, I'm getting a loan.* 
**Christmas discussion:**
*It's a bubble right now. Tech is ok tho. Expect a correction. Get out as soon as you can*
*Yeah, getting out and paying my loan, nice profit tho.*
Then the cycle continues.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:33:31
right now, yes, future, no one knows, as Bitcoin is still in early-access phase, or infancy phase if you please.
