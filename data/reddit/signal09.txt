I don't like the term "bit". It is already a well know term in the technology space.   However a standard base unit is a good idea, I think it should have a more financially focused name.

To be honest apple went in the shitter pretty bad, so really no one wanted to invest in it at one point.

Title is misleading. It is the first for the US, not the first Bitcoin ATMs in the world.

So you mean an informed person.

Like any new piece of technology it takes time to foster ideas and for it to mature into ( or die trying to be) a product.  
I wouldn't say nobody cares about it. The fact that it has caught on this much so far is an indicator that it has a lot of potential and people who are interesting.  
Since Bitcoin relies on people, it will take the people to bring it forward.  community and innovation are the keys to its success.

@_date: 2015-02-07 16:33:56
Uh ok.  Which company ?
Considering the avg. big data engineers who have all the buzz words on their resume; get paid 140$k a YEAR in the San. Francisco area.
Are you even in the industry ?
Some proof bro, or you just bullshitting.

BS.  Here is an example of salaries with common keywords.  That's per year.  I've been in this industry a long time; if he is telling you he makes 120k a month... he is selling you magic beans.
