And who enforces the regulation. Who's to say I don't make up my own stamps and fake it? 
We already see basically fake advertising now. How bad would that get with no rules. 
I understand what your saying. I understand the want for freedom. 
I also understand that freedom and "safety" don't go together. 
So where's the equilibrium.... Mine is not everybody gets to make up their own laws. 
I enjoy going from Illinois to Texas and knowing I have the same basic rights in both states. 
Not sure I'd want to travel much if people go do whatever they want whenever they want. 
Difference of opinion I guess. 
Thanks for the convo so far.

Interesting that you say that since organizations throughout history have been banding together to protect freedom from other countries or bodies that would enslave them.

Maybe when it becomes less volatile, we can talk about it. 
But it's currently not being used as a currency by anybody but a niche group. And won't be until it stops making people lose money because it's beyond volatile. 
No company would use something so volatile as a legitimate exchange currency. 
Edit: I own crypto as well. I'm not here to bash it or down play it's usefulness. I have a monetary skin in the game. But you can't say A is B just because you want it to be. 
Especially when A is being used as C.

Quick question. Do you think a for profit company offering security services is gonna cost less or more than what we currently "pay". And also, how much cost could be cut out if we fixed our current overpaying bullcrap. 
In my opinion, for profit will either be more expensive for better, or cheaper for cutting corners. Just an opinion though. I'm sure there are examples for both sides, cheaper and better, not cheaper and worse.

Or you can take a stupid supreme Court decision and blow it up bigger then it needs to be. 
Let's look at one instance of something wrong and deny all the good cops do every single day for people. 
Seems about right. 
Enjoy your anarchy but do it in another country.

And how do local laws help when the issue is global. 
What does it do to a business when they have to have a regulatory department pay attention to thousands of different jurisdictions laws instead of just 50 states and the fed? 
How do you bring about a nationalist, or globalist world view, and state that local rules will work in that type of environment? 
It doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:07:38
Fair point. But look what that type of inflation already does to the economy.

For real, is this sub r/conspiracy now?

How about the fact that during the time you are speaking of, we had to borrow from France to pay for anything.
After that, before 1812, our money came from tarrifs at the time. Tarrif would be a tax would it not? Shouldn't that bother you like a tax does? 
You can't have a government without money. 
For that you need taxes. Your point is completely invalid.

Is it not income????

That doesn't make any sense. That's like saying we should allow anybody to have nukes because only America has used them and that's like .000001% usage so nobody else is gonna use them either. 
Also, if 95% of your day is living in "anarchy". And you are pretty safe and know what to expect from laws and the expectations of society due to those laws....
Why are you wanting to get rid of the 5%. 
Is the 5% worth it to you, just to have the freedom to do whatever you want? 
What would you do differently if you had that capability? 
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:26:48
I don't agree that it shouldn't be taxed. 
Are people not making fist from this? 
If I invest 3,000 and sell for 1,000,000, how can you say I didn't make a profit and owe taxes on it??? 
@_date: 2018-10-30 21:17:47
It's sensational and people click on it.
It's all about greed. Clickbait man. No conspiracy there. Just stupid people clicking on things and not looking because that's what they want to read.

Yes I do recognize that I can get physical protection elsewhere. The walls of my house grant me physical protection. 
Doesn't mean I'm okay with anarchy...... 
Tell me how you can have no taxes, and not have anarchy. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 17:29:54
Please tell me what other countries you are seeing that have basically no taxes that people are leaving to? 
@_date: 2018-10-30 21:15:59
Us and Switzerland have much higher taxes???? 
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:40:28
And who pays them? Some rich dude gonna hire cops for the town? Or just himself? 
Tell me how many people can pay for private security? 
It's not realistic.

Then when you get robbed or shot, don't call the police. Or expect anybody to enforce laws, or protect your land from invaders. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 21:15:33
Because they uphold the laws and freedoms that give you the ability to make that money
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:41:58
I'd be interested to see thoughts on funding public works that are not taxation. As I am sure anybody should be haha. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:15:01
So you want anarchy? No laws, no rules, everybody does whatever they want? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:39:50
Yeah, and costs an insane amount of electricity to mine. Good thing for the environment right? 
Bitcoin will die with it's failed community. One of those being this subreddit that I feel munipulates conversations with it's hidden points for 12 hours. 
Bitcoin is archaic..... It's like sticking with a check book when you can use a credit card. 
All it has right now is a name.... Other then that, it is pretty horrible.
