maybe this broke the balance of bitcoin.  Do we want a future of money where some shadowy figure outright stole and control 6% of the economies money?
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:14:39
I agree with you on this. It's just too easy to claim you are the creator of bitcoin and then conviently say you won't talk about it and live in secrecy. Bullshit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:21:24
Edit: deleted what I said about this being a bitcoin protocol issue.  This is totally a custom implementation by Mt. Gox that they f'd up.  This guys provides a good description of the mt Gox f'up:   
@_date: 2014-03-14 23:45:32
what in the world are you talking about?  There is only one bitcoin protocol.

Or the drug king pins get together and assinate him. I feel that is deserved.

Oo oo...can I be satoshi next?!
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:24:20
that sort of contradicts the article if you are providing a screenshot of his public git hub for version control.

A gift card where the money is in my wallet. I cant tell you how many times I have been screwed over with store gift cards.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:01:04
too bad it's not him.
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:04:13
That article is full of misnomers. I don't agree with every point he made.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:03:25
Hey..founder of the Help Ukraines with Bitcoin from your wallet oh sweet sweet Bitcoin foundation.
I vouch. these guys are legit.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:37:04
I can never tell if a person is being sarcastic when they ask curtly for the sources, but damnit.. I hate having to dig up the sources.. I just wanna say go google it yourself.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:12:52
This is such a hot steamy load of...   its poor reporting on behalf of newsweek
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:00:55
It's like having infinite saves when you're trying to beat a video game.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:53:51
I personally believe he should be assasinated.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:13:38
So whats the end game..what happens then? 2140.

Looks like people are downvoting every comment..
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:50:16
He's not. He's just using it as an example. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:57:17
luckily coinbase.com with their ach debits for americans and their spiffy website.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:38:50
But you hold on to all my coin, right? Yaaaa
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:52:24
Why do people pronounce it like dooche (dogecoin) instead of doggey coin? 
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:13:12
A simplistic title like "Bitcoin is evil" is so black and white and also rather hyperbolic. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:20:55
If it crashes or is replaced id feel good atleast getting out the original money I put in to it before the price rised.
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:59:40
What you say is true but you're getting downvoted because people love bitcoin. Is this true down voters or can you comment otherwise?
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:39:55
Ya, these alt coins are making me yawn.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:06:21
I agree with you about having control of your Bitcoin, but serious question.. How does one have control?  I tried Amory, but downloading the updates would have taken a week at that rate.. that's ridiculous!   
What are some good ways of getting our bitcoins secure in a reasonable manner for the average joe?
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:25:14
So with the current mining, are there two types of mining. One for mining bitcoins..and another mining operation to verify/facilitate transactions?
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:47:15
makes me question why are we putting so much faith in to blockchain.info if it's only run by 1 or a couple people.
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:00:36
The smirk was a cherry picked frame.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:25:45
thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:22:59
Not really..the guy said he was satoshi. He asked for whatever he gets
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:24:17
I officially have 100% more than you, so ha
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:16:16
So you're getting 40% of your money back.  This really is a repeat scam! hahahaha  We've seen this before.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:04:52
'break backawards compatibility' in this case would mean rendering all existing bitcoin useless and non-compatible.. millions would vanish.  It's unlikely that there would be a 2.0 for bitcoin; it would be better to create another alt-coin of which we are already being flooded with the likes of dogecoin, litecoin.. ad nasium. 
However, the bitcoin protocol itself is open source and there are always changes being done.. for instance.. 70% of the original Satoshi code has been re-written after he gave it to the bitcoin foundation.
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:53:03
Multimillions in transactions run by a less than 10 person organization. Sounds reasonable!  
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:56:41
Naw..I watched it go from 480 to 495
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:20:44
haha ya I instantly thought the same thing when I read the article.
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:37:01
i feel like they are trying to class it up, so to speak.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:55:03
Ahh..so cute
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:10:32
true.  All I'm saying is the mob's money goes missing, someone's gotta get wacked.  Be it the Gox asshat or the drug pin that kept his money in the exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:03:11
Even IF he recovered the coins he might as well run off with them.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:33:52
God willing we dont see ashton playing a satoshi character in hollywoods next based on a true story buchery
@_date: 2013-05-20 00:48:47
I think there is a major difference your comparison is missing when comparing a bank to btc.  If your money is stolen out of your bank, it is at least traceable to find out which bank accounts your money was siphoned off to.   With BTC, someone can steal your money with no danger of being caught.
