What Bitcoin needs is both. In what way does Bitcoin core have a better development team? Original developers, like Gavin Andersen, who build the foundation of Bitcoin were long ago driven away from Bitcoin core. What has current development team done that is so brilliant?
They managed to divide the community. Bitcoin cash was born because of their actions. How can one team, one company, take over the whole development of Bitcoin and turn it to something else it was meant to be?

Nobody is going to buy Bitcoin cash for the reasons you mentioned. Everybody can see the price difference, different name etc. 
But people who have educated themself of the history of Bitcoin will buy Bitcoin Cash, because it works exactly like Bitcoin worked 2-8 years ago. It's easier to understand, cheap, fast and technically superior to Bitcoin.

He was promoting Bitcoin with a vision he has about it. Everything he told was true. People who want a peer to peer electronic cas are going to use Bitcoin cash. People who want to speculate and are after quick gains with high risks want Bitcoin. It's as simple as that.

Never take any investment advice from reddit. Especially from a Bitcoin maximalist. He is going to say every other coin is a scam. Make your own research and don't let anyone influence you.

Roger did well. Jimmy had no logic in what he said. Truly unbelievable trash talk.

Blockstream controls the development. Early developers were kicked out allready. Blockstream has a full controll of Bitcoin development now.

Yes, celebrate everything that lessens crypto adoption and publicity.

Fanatics would be the most fitting word

This was Roger Ver vs Jimmy Song debate. Not btc vs bch. It was Jimmys decision from the very start to attack bch with some complete bs like claiming it is fiat currency. Roger had a great counter point on that one right away. It was clear that Jimmy had prepared well, he was very aggressive and this talking format made it possible. Roger had barely any time to defend his points and almost no time to make any counter claims.

If it gets added to coinbase surely that will only drive the price up? Lot's of new buying potential there

It's funny and on the other hand sad that he gets so much undeserved hate. Haven't seen him bashing anyone from core dev team like this. The man just wants to have a bitcoin that is being used in it's original purpose: as digital money. He has not betrayed anybody since that is what bitcoin was originally created for.

He would have been more prominent than anyone currently developing btc and ethereum wouldn't even exist. There are no really prominent btc developers right now. They are all equally incompetent one way or an other

Btc is not peer to peer electronic cash. It abandoned that vision a long time ago by intentionally crippling it's capacity. Individuals don't need to run a full node since that doesn't have any benefits to the network.

His original intention was to build ethereum on top of Bitcoin.

Vinny Lingham, Erik Voorhees, Emil Oldenburg, Roger Ver, Graig Wright, Gavin Andresen,.

Voorhees was gonna sell off all of his bch according to interviews that he gave before the fork had happened. Ver was segwit 2X supporter. He turned to full bch supporter after that failed. Voorhees started changing his mind after that too. Wright wasn't in the bch team right from the start either.

They have the same white paper. Bch doesn't have a new white paper because that original white paper was the reason why the split happened. r/btc thinks bch is more loyal to the original white paper and vision that Nakamoto had about Bitcoin. The idea is based on the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto said the block size could and should be raised when bitcoin usage started to hit scaling limits. 1mb limit was meant to be only temporary. Current btc developers for some reason just refused to raise the limit when the time to do that was coming. Nakamoto said that Bitcoin should never hit the scaling limits onchain. That's where the idea comes that bch is more true to the white paper.
Yes currently any of this doesn't matter because you can transfer btc with tiny fees too but the last bull market showed that btc as of right now can't support heavy usage. Hopefully lightning gets ready before the next one.

It was a sub for people who got kicked out of here. Most of whom were big blockers and naturally became bch supporters. So there never was a takeover, you can talk all things relating bitcoin there. Most of the people just are more interested in bch.
@_date: 2019-01-18 19:50:56
Bitcoin community didn't agree how to scale the coin so a split happened and two new coins were born. Bch went with the original vision of being peer to peer electronic cash for everyday payments and btc went with a vision of being digital gold that is not meant to be used as a currency but more like a gambling token that you hold forever and wait for it to appreciate in value.

Well it's fast and cheap and deflates in value against fiat. Only thing it needs is to make it easier to use for common people. Cryptos are needed the most in 3rd world countries and the adoption will increase in there in the coming years
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:05:50
But who stole them from who? BCH that represents what Bitcoin was created for or BTC that is something completely new. Original Bitcoin doesn't exist anymore. BTC and BCH are what are left of it.
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:55:45
BCH is Bitcoin and even more rightfull version than BTC. Roger Ver is a Bitcoin maximalist who has supported it for years. BCH is more on the line of original vision so no wonder he likes it better nowadays, since BCH can be used as a digital money but BTC is unusable.
Roger Ver is just an advocate and Bitcoin supporter he doesn't have anymore power in BCH than me and you.
