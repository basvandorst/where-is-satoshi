People have been buying like mad lately, but they use ACH transfers and it takes several days for the USD to go between banks (fiat is slow).  My guess is the recent price rise means there is a metric ton of cash headed their way from buy orders, but hasn't cleared.  So they're likely doing the responsible thing and not allowing users to create sales that aren't accounted for yet.  
~~Plenty of other places to sell BTC, try an exchange~~
Ha, that was quick!

haa, and this is where the smarties get paid.  I have zero ability to code for something to check this.

Where are you seeing less than £200?  That's a steal!

ditto kid.  Although truthfully the smartest of them all sold before the flash crash and then bought at the bottom.

I would love a bitcoin wallet that can reliable enforce a delay when my Coins are being sent out and notify me of such.  It might make theft of BTC much harder.

Oh please let this be a thing

I know right?  Sadly, it is possible for everyone to lose money simultaneously on mining if too many people want a slice of the pie.  
The only people truly safe are those who had access to free equipment, but even that's doubtful because there are rarely free ASICs lying around nowadays.

Just email them about it.  This was an automatic process and they can review your account to override it.

how on earth would they action off something like that?

Your logic is sound, but you'd actually be surprised.  I bought an Avalon ASIC for ~70 BTC back in February when the exchange rate was low.  I don't think anyone realized how bitcoin was going to explode back then. 
At the end of the cycle I made about ~100 BTC with it.

Try Coinbase, its like a 1% fee to sell USD, you just have to connect a bank

Here's to hoping you can get a good re-try.  I just sent you a 25.21 mBTC tip using [BitTip!](

Mining is not a venture for new users.  If you really wanted to make profits off of bitcoin, just buy them in smaller amounts over a regular interval.  
Don't be fooled by the stories of the past, it's no longer a hobbyists game.  It has nothing to do with being "dedicated" and everything to do with getting a jump on the latest mining equipment.  Unless you got insanely lucky with buying a high-tier miner early or you're developing your own tech, your miner will likely never earn more bitcoin than you could have just bought directly instead.

It would have taken several first generation ASICs to do this.  2nd generation ASICs didn't start getting delivered until April-May and BFL certainly didn't put out a product like that early in the year.  
@_date: 2013-10-29 03:03:05
Bingo.  Well hey at least we can give you something for the correct answer.  I just sent you a tip of 1 USD using [BitTip!](
