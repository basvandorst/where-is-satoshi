This doom and gloom mentality that gavin and hearn are pushing is really bad though. It is fragmenting the community cause people think the world will end if a block hits 1mb. If more of the core devs agreed with gavin/hearn that would be one thing, but the truth is they are the only ones who want 20mb asap. I think it is incredibly reckless what they are doing.

Again you are not at all acknowledging the definition of the word.

Because bigger blocks do not solve the longterm problem of scaling. If bitcoin grows an order of magnitude or more there will be another hard fork required. The proper solution is dynamic scaling or implementation of payment channels. Not half ass hard forks and new clients every few years.

Im not against evolving systems of cooperation, im against systems that require a monopoly of violence and the use of force to make their systems acceptable.

Government however is not, more often than not you are forced with violence to abide by arbitrary laws and selective enforcement of those laws.

The fact that people still DO break the law makes this point irrelevant.

You are correct, Ethereum will allow many of these things, but also note they use "ether" as the settlement token which also acts as the unit-of-account and incentive. Any decentralized trusted network requires those aspects. Permissioned ledgers (ripple, eris) rely upon trusted third parties for the settlement process to occur. Unlike with proof of work ledgers which only requires someones pc to do a mathematical hash function.

Compliance means arbitrary control of peoples funds, we already have this with paypal and credit cards. These compliant companies are routinely forced to seize funds at the discretion of corrupt governments (Wikileaks, Snowden, Expats, etc...) 
These are the very reasons as to why Bitcoin was created, to remove this arbitrary control. Ripple can comply all they want, but inevitably peoples funds will be unfairly seized on their network and it will just drive people to adopt truly decentralized currencies like Bitcoin.

This is all circumstantial, the amount of new users and legit txs would have to increase by magnitudes of its current state in order for a problem to arise. What is the rush? Are you getting impatient that your investment is not making you rich yet so you believe reckless meddling with the protocol will bring new users and fulfill your dreams? 
The protocol would work fine because a fee market would be created while other innovative solutions would arise.

Does not justify rushing a hard fork. Bitcoin has been around for 6 years nad it barely has 1 million active users. People need to calm down.
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:56:46
No, people have a very inflated idea about the current size of Bitcoin. There are less than a million active users. There is potential for it to grow but rushing a hardfork wont fix that. Actual use cases for Bitcoin will. Im all for raising the blocksize slightly but not without developer consensus. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:31:23
And what would be the incentive for an attacker to waste $30,000 to briefly slow the network?
@_date: 2015-08-24 13:10:50
Because of BitcoinXT trying to fork the network. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:59:58
If there isn't sufficient adoption of bitcoin raising the limit wont save it, it will be overtaken by something else. It comes down to market principles, either usage will increase and by 2031 there will be enough txs to sustain miners through fees or it wont and the Bitcoin experiment will fail, simple as that. 
Also if bitcoins are no longer scarce they wont be worth very much. Miners have a incentive to keep bitcoins scarce because that increases the value of the coins they mine.

There is a lot of agendas being pushed in here, its causing division in the community and reckless action concerning the Bitcoin protocol. We are no where near the capacity for the network.

You are completely ignoring game theory here. As soon as people detect the network is being flooded they will raise their tx fees above whatever the attacker is spending. Transactions would not be stopped at all, a fee market would take over. It would increasingly cost most money to attack the network and there is no guarantee it would drop the price.

[I found the blogpost you speak of.](
The section in question, "What about everyone else?" does not specify if these companies support XT or just bigger blocks (a big difference), there is also no source of where these companies have stated their support. IMO this is not evidence that shows reputable companies support XT.


I disagree, within 1-2 days the stress test pushed the mempool from less than 1mb to over 100mb w/ over 100k txs. Bitcoin adoption would have to grow many orders of magnitude to jeopardize the network. Also take into account that joe six pack is just gonna get a coinbase or circle account which is off chain anyways.  
Like I said the risk/reward just doesn't play out, I see no rational reason to push this XT hard fork.

This was the fault of wallet software not properly assessing network fees. Protocol was fine for users using competent wallet implementations. 


 
Caused by the same problem as above.


Source? Also there is always a risk accepting 0 confirmation transactions. Again, can be guarded against with proper usage and implementation. 
Shortly after the network flood we saw many wallet providers change their fee structure. The protocol handled the flood just fine, incorrect implementation did not.

He also wanted to add censorship features into the TOR network. 
Hearn is quite the authoritarian, just watch some of his videos. Unfortunately the long line of casual bitcoin users he has as followers have been doing a hell of a job shilling for XT. However, the majority of developers, miners, and nodes want nothing to do with forking to the XT code base.

Your whole reply is based on the premise that removing bitcoin scarcity wont cause a drop in price. Its absurd to think that adding more inflation to bitcoin will preserve the currencies value, have you looked around the world lately?
The miners do have incentive to keep bitcoins scarce because then even small fees will be worth more to them.

XT was born out of FUD. A few months back Gavin and Hearn were posting blogs about "crash landings" and how bad it will be when blocksize is maxed out. 
Then a stress test came along that proved bitcoin can continue to operate fine in the event of a spam attack on the network. All users have to do is increase theirs fees by a few cents, which then forces the attacker to either waste more money on fees or quit.
XT needs to be forgotten , nothing good will come of it other than incentivizing people to stress test the Bitcoin network, proving it is robust enough to handle spam attacks.

The proof that satoshi controls any coins is inconclusive. However it is proven that satoshi did not create those coins out of thin air, they were the result of auditable PoW algorithm. The difference here is that Ripple is a centralized ledger with gatekeepers who can be influenced to act upon and track users. The CCO of ripple labs goes over it in detail during their ripple commercial for the California finance committee.

Well using that logic, anything can be done with a hard-fork. Just because it can be done doesn't mean it will be, plus you still need network consensus.

Another one who thinks bitcoin can  be removed from the blockchain. For one bitcoins are the unit of account used to make entries on the blockchain, there needs to be some kind of token. If the token is issued by a trusted third party its by definition not a blockchain.
A blockchain is defined as: a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions. A novel solution accomplishes this without any trusted central authority: maintenance of the block chain is performed by a network of communicating nodes running bitcoin software. (wikipedia)
So if your ledger has a trusted third party it should NOT be considered a blockchain.  People are really caught up in this meme about blockchain good bitcoin bad, yet no one proposes a solution as to how to achieve decentralized consensus to this problem. Satoshi talks about it extensively in the white paper.

All these people claiming blockchains (decentralized asset ledgers without trusted third parties) can work without tokenized incentives need to prove their claims. 
The Bitcoin whitepaper goes into detail as to why an incentive is needed to achieve a trustless network. 
The people parroting this response about blockchains existing without a incentive are not backing up their claims with anything, its all hot air. Call these people out, tell them they need to prove their claims. 
Bitcoin is here and it works and it is because there is an incentive.

@_date: 2015-04-03 23:56:24
OK well lets use the example of banks, they are all trusted parties share a ledger and yet corruption is rampant. 
Git is collaborative, its not decentralized in the sense Bitcoin is. The benefit of removing trusted third parties is censorship resistance, IBM and all these companies you speak of are centralized entities who can be censored, easily corrupted, and target directly for cyber-attack. 
If you want an **immutable ledger** like the blockchain you need an incredibly robust decentralized network. There is no comparison, its just not financially viable for any one company to be able to create as a robust network as Bitcoin already has, especially without incentive. People think this distributed network is no big deal but the scale of this seriously dwarfs everything.

I swear these ripple shills have such a sneaky roundabout way of admitting that ripple is incredibly centralized. They wanna pretend its just like bitcoin but the truth is its not.
Wanna know the difference between permissioned ledgers (ripple) and permissionless (Bitcoin) ones? [Read this paper](
The one thing these distributed database ledgers cannot achieve is immutability. The only known solution to creating a truly decentralized immutable ledger is proof of work, this is because you cannot fake computer cycles. Remove proof of work and you are forced to rely on trusted third parties, there are no two ways about it.
The true breakthrough of Bitcoin is removal of trusted third parties and the creation of an immutable ledger. Everything beyond that is buzzwords and glorified SWIFT banking.

An invalid transaction is not the same as censoring a transaction. The only reason any transaction is deemed invalid is because it is a double spend. Any ledger that is privately controlled by specially chosen miners can actively censor transactions at will even if they are valid or not.
The bitcoin blockchain uphold neutral settlements on all valid transactions. A privately controlled ledger does not uphold this because it reintroduces trusted third parties.

Considering you need to use bitcoins to make entries on the blockchain I would say this guy is incredibly uninformed about how the technology actually works. He needs to go read the Bitcoin whitepaper before making intellectually dishonest statements. Satoshi goes into detail about why an incentive model is needed to achieve distributed consensus.


the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of
ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes
control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes
work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are
not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what
happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

A BIP38 wallet is a password protected private key. If someone were to find your bip38 wallet they would not be able to access the funds without also knowing the password you created. *Obviously this password should be a phrase of some kind and not just 1 word with a few special characters.* Since the BIP38 key is encrypted you can store it digitally, even hand out copies to family memebers. As long as you have that password you will be the only one who can access the funds.

I listened to the whole thing, here is my synopsis:
Discussion begins with a good explanation of Bitcoin and why decentralization is the key to the technology, by Jerry Brito (Executive Director, Coin Center) 
Fred Ehrsam (Co-Founder &amp; President, Coinbase) pushes for fair regulation to encourage new companies to compete in the financial sector.
Chris Larson and Karen Gifford, both from ripple labs begin their introduction by immediately shilling ripple technology and how easy it is to track and control user accounts with ripple. When asked about Bitcoin they attempt to explain it by pretending only the blockchain exists and not bitcoin, in the process thoroughly confusing the committee. Essentially they are pretending that bitcoin is useless and all thats important is the blockchain. 
*"We don't think the world needs a new currency, we already have plenty."* -Chris Larson - CEO, Ripple Labs 
i.e., we want to be a new centralized trusted third party for existing fiat currencies. -ripple
Again, we see here the false narrative that the only useful thing about Bitcoin is the blockchain. Even though the bitcoin token is the entire backbone which creates the incentive for the decentralized trusted network to exist.

[Block chains are defined as independent distributed networks.](
A private network that tried to mimic these properties would need to be called something else.
Your assumption that transactions will be "immutable and irreversible" in a centralized system is fundamentally flawed. The entire concept and strength behind bitcoin is that there is no central authority and therefore transactions cannot be censored or reversed. If you had a system where mining is restricted to only certain parties you have created a centralized trusted third party who can manipulate the network as they see fit. If there is no open participation there is no trustless network.


If you want a truly disturbed trustless network you certainly do need incentives for people to participate. Sure you can get 10 central banks to mine it but that doesn't make it trustless does it? 
I don't think you fully understand that the main achievement of Bitcoin was removing trusted third parties.

Karpeles attitude shows he was being threatened/extorted/gagged. He often mentioned that he should have hired private security and that the bitcoin werent lost or stolen just "inaccessible".
When the news broke the media circus went into full effect, talking points a narratives blanketed the press wires, an all out attempt to discredit Bitcoin. Gox then announced "inherit flaws" in the Bitcoin protocol was to blame, another directed attempt to discredit Bitcoin. The feds M.O. is all over it, Karps and these two agents are the fall guys now, I still firmly believe the lost gox coins are in the hands of the feds, gox public addresses will never be released because if they were those "lost" coins would leave a breadcrumb trail right to the culprit. Mixing 500k+ BTC is in no way feasible at the moment. The feds tried very hard with this one but they ultimately failed, the staying power only makes Bitcoin strong and people more curious.
This is why Bitcoin is such a threat to the system, they rely on manipulating words and building truth based on their ability to propagandize the public. With blockchain ledgers suddenly "their word" is worthless. They want to be arbiters of truth, but Bitcoin changes this paradigm.  Resistance is futile, the old paradigm is at an end.

Yes and gateways can be compromised at any time for any number of reasons. XRP still flows between gateways and again whenever that asset moves I have to hope my gateways have not been compromised. 


Except that ripple labs pre-mined the entire supply of XRP.
The reason Bitcoin requires energy is because its actually useful and provides undeniable proof-of-work to secure its ledger. If Bitcoin wasn't useful it would have died long ago but from what I see its only becoming more and more useful. Plus as far as energy efficiency goes, the legacy banking system is a behemoth of wasted energy of endless marble buildings and skyscrapers.

No miner is able to freeze my bitcoins, why should I have trust ripple gateways which can be compromised themselves? Lets say my long trusted gateway gets a subpoena and suddenly my funds are frozen. In comparison this scenario can never happen in Bitcoin unless you use a custodial wallet.
A 51% attacks is far hard to achieve than compromising a ripple gateway. The Bitcoin network has grown so fast that accomplishing a successful 51% diminishes every day and again is far more complicated than compromising a ripple gateway.

@_date: 2015-03-18 20:10:38
Bitcoin exchanges have nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol, a bitcoin exchange is not a gateway the same way a ripple gateway is one. A ripple gateway is a integral part of the ripple network which can be easily targeted, exploited, and compromised. 
In order to achieve this in bitcoin one would have to acquire 51% of the network power which again is increasingly difficult, the bitcoin network now is [more decentralized than it has ever been.](
Again you are being disingenuous by associating bitcoin exchanges with the bitcoin protocol.
Bitcoin is an incentive based network, it incorpates game theory as a means to create competition market where the most efficient and honest party is reworded. Your use and manipulation of words shows you are nothing but a shill for ripple labs.
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:09:12
Ripple places trust completely in gateway nodes, these nodes do not perform any kind of proof of work function. The PoW function is a mathematical proof that allows mathematical verification of the trust process. At any time a trusted ripple gateway can be compromised, where as with bitcoin compromising 51% of the network grows more difficult every day, there is also no incentive to compromise the bitcoin network. There is a lot of incentive to compromise ripple. Ripple is far more susceptible to government regulation as well. 
Lets call it how it is here, ripple is database system based on IOUs and trusted third parties. Bitcoin is a distributed ledger based on settlement instruments with a decentralized trust model that is increasingly hard to compromise.

Discussion begins with a good explanation of Bitcoin and why decentralization is the key by Jerry Brito (Executive Director, Coin Center) 
Fred Ehrsam (Co-Founder &amp; President, Coinbase) pushes for fair regulation to encourage new companies to compete in the financial sector.
Chris Larson and Karen Gifford, both from ripple labs begin their introduction by immediately shilling ripple technology and how easy it is to track and control user accounts with ripple. When asked about Bitcoin they attempt to explain it by pretending only the blockchain exists and not bitcoin, in the process thoroughly confusing the committee. Essentially they are pretending that bitcoin is useless and all thats important is the blockchain. 
*"We don't think the world needs a new currency, we already have plenty."* -Chris Larson - CEO, Ripple Labs 
i.e., we want to be a new centralized trusted third party for existing fiat currencies. -ripple
Again, we see here the false narrative that the only useful thing about Bitcoin is the blockchain. Even though the bitcoin token is the entire backbone which creates the incentive for the decentralized trusted network to exist. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:29:07
So how exactly does email work without the internet again? Furthermore, the nature of Bitcoin is that its a decentralized trustless ledger. In order for a blockchain to have the benefits it does it must be decentralized, i.e. trusted third parties are removed. 
Ripple on the other hand is claiming all the benefits of Bitcoin can be easily copied without the need for a incentive or decentralized trust. Listen to the audio recording posted below, they explicitly say the strength of Ripple is that you can track and control user accounts and with Bitcoin you cannot. 
Ripple is an IOU system Bitcoin is a settlement system, Ripple is fiat 1.5 with new middlemen, Bitcoin is money 2.0 with no middlemen.

Ive gone over this in detail in other posts. Ripple gateways are the weak point, the user has to trust certain gateways to be honest. This for one creates centralized gateways everyone trusts, but also any gateway can be compromised at any time for any number of reasons. This however cannot be done on the bitcoin network because of the proof-of-work required to maintain the ledger.

No, bitpay actually uses bitcoin, coinbase forces you to create an account in order to send off-chain transactions. 
Bitpay has better merchant tools as well, they are also building innovative open source tools.
Coinbase does nothing but get VC funding then proceeds to do absolutely nothing with it. The least they could do is update their website to make it more user friendly.

[1] Owning some currency is much different than pre-mining and owning ALL the currency.
[2] Counterparty is used to represent assets on top of bitcoins. Ripple is used to represent assets on top of XRP. Ripple is run by a for profit company and requires the trust of ripple gateways to function properly. I am trying to make the point that Bitcoin is a decentralized trustless network and Ripple is not, even though we have all these ripple shills running around pretending it is. When you get down to network architecture the fact of the matter is ripple is a trusted thid party system, period.

Sorry, you can only transfer bitcoin to a bitcoin wallet. With ripple you exchange XRP for BTC which is then sent to your wallet, again its an IOU system in that sense.
Sure ripple can exist and people will use it, but dont pretend its a decentralized trustless network, because its not. 
Like I said it sounds like counterparty and sidechains already make ripple irrelevant. Why use ripple when I can use a sidechain or counterparty token backed by the proof-of-work of a network that is vastly more secure?

Except the cash in your real life wallet cannot be arbitrarily seized and frozen like coinbase can do. 
Its not hard at all to manage a personal wallet, many apps like breadwallet, mycelium, electrum, multibit are all user friendly wallets that offer personal security of your funds. They will never ask you where you are spending your money like coinbase does. 
Another issues with coinbase is their frequent absence of QR codes(bitcoin payment addresses) in their email invoicing and payment requests. There are many instances where a payment request from coinbase forces you to sign up for a coinbase account in order to pay for it. Not only does this confuse the individual but it harms the merchants because they can potentially lose sales based on coinbase attempting to force people to adopt their walled garden. 
Make no mistake, coinbase has shown that they are in the business of compliance, they will do whatever is asked of them in order to maintain their business. This is their choice and there is nothing wrong with that, but dont assume for a second that you will be treated fairly by coinbase, they will enforce whatever orders they are given by regulators.
Learn and adopt personal responsibility if you want to benefit from the real advantaged of Bitcoin. You will be better for it and so will society, the less centralized choke points of failure, the better.
