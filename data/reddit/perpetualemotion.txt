FDR actually enforced the policy. Americans were legally obligated to give up their gold for legal tender in the 30s, and were not able to trade it back. Only international countries could exchange for gold, and this was the last thread of the gold standard system that Nixon cut 40 years later. 
I don’t have a cute cartoon to explain this to you, but that might not be the best reference for history.

Our money is backed by the government now. And Bitcoin is backed by faith. Even gold and silver backed money is based on trust of its value somewhere, so w/e, but it is more universally valued. 
The advantage of the gold standard is to prevent inflation, as the way it should work is all money circulation represents actual assets held and universally valued. However, our government wanted less constraints and the ability to use inflation as a tool in times of economic recession or depression. Which is why we were forced to transition to fiat money in the 30s. 
I don’t like the idea of our economy being manipulated by the federal bank, but I have less confidence in a system of trade that is decentralized, without any accountability, and without protection to investors. Having government oversight makes the most sense, and we really just need to transition from paper money to digital.
