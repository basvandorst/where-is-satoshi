Just HODL, you lose money when you sell, not when the market value decreases
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:47:48
I bought at $17,200 then again at $16,300 then again at $14,200.
Come on man, you think I’m ever selling this shit? No. This is a giant lottery ticket to me. 95% I lose everything; 5% chance I start my own business with the gains.
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:32:38
I have no idea whether or not you are right so I will continue to DCA and HODL

“What will profits look like next quarter?”
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:23:25
Yup I am buying BTC right now but that’s it. Holding other stuff, but no reason to buy alts until there is some sign of a recovery.
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:50:02
Everyone chill, $6k is clearly the floor value of Bitcoin... that’s been an ironclad law even in this market. Every time it gets close you get a bounce.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:12:19
Is ok. I have lots of time
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:37:51
Can’t we come up with new stock memes? 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:10:54
This is why there is a floor on the value of Bitcoin. When the price gets low enough the true believers will accumulate more.

It is risky to keep all of your money in Bitcoin.
It is also risky to keep all of your money in the bank.

Patience you will get it for $10 soon enough 
@_date: 2018-08-20 02:11:57
I’m not here for your revolution, man. I expect to be well paid. And if I thought central banks were the best way to do that, I’d be with them.
I’m here for one thing and one thing only: to make money.
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:27:19
Dude I am here for one reason, to get filthy rich, ok? I’m not selling a damned thing because if I do I would have the worst FOMO ever.
That’s it. I don’t give a damn about the tech. Yes, I believe in its potential, otherwise I would not have bought, but I don’t care about your rebellion. I expect to be well paid, I’m in it for the money. (Whatever form money takes.)
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:51:41
Dude I didn’t buy anything at 3k and I’m still pissed off. If it goes down that far I am selling stocks to buy an entire Bitcoin at that level
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:12:14
I will take that suggestion under advisement
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:28:55
Basically my life right now
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:07:22
This quote could not possibly be truer
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:31:34
Patience. I will get worried if it gets under about $6,300 but until that happens I’m far from concerned. That seems to be the floor whenever it crashes.
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:05:43
Ice water in the veins baby. Patience is a virtue.
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:38:01
This is why you are foolish if you have no BTC at all. Inflation is not just inevitable, it’s actually considered desirable by the powers that be so as to encourage consumer spending on worthless items.
Quantitative easing continued for far too long. The reason BTC and ETH will increase in price relative to USD is because of inflation, long term.
But if you think that the USD is going away entirely any time soon, I would like to know where you get your drugs. Not happening. The US Dollar  is the foundation of the global financial system (oil has a lot to say about this too).
There will always be people who prefer the speed of conventional fiat to the security of crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:25:34
If you live in the Democratic rich world, you do not need Bitcoin. If you live in the developing world or under an authoritarian regime, you cannot trust the regime and therefore need BTC.
In the US we do not need Bitcoin and anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar. But in Venezuela, try spending Bolivars and people will laugh at you.
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:04:14
As a rule of thumb I have been buying BTC in big amounts whenever that $7,000 level is breached at the bottom end. I have many buys from $6,500-$8,000 the past few months.
Still hodling from 18k, too, though... DCA
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:38:22
The third type of person adopts Ethereum because it is superior to Bitcoin in every way. ��
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:08:57
You had your chance to buy the dip and missed it lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:44:10
Bruh I only regret that I was sleeping when BTC hit 6k. I was ready to back up my truck at that price and I missed it.
(Oh yeah I bought at 17k before then)
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:47:20
You lose when you try to time the market. You win when you buy and hodl UNTIL YOU HIT YOUR PREDETERMINED SELL PRICE.
Then, and only then, do you sell.
In my case, that is BTC 100k. You will not see me sell a damned thing until then.
For ETH? Yeah, it’s also 100k. I believe in the tech so much that I may be hodling it for years.
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:08:16
Yeah I had a big buy at 7.2 and another at 8.5. I’m still down on my 17.4 buy though ��

I once tried to make a joke about fish, but naturally, it was a flop
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:28:26
This is correct. Currency is only ever worth what someone else will give you for it. Fiat is more stable for one reason, and only one reason: people trust that it will be.

Don’t be so negative, when I see a little bit of green for two straight days that’s when I know it’s time to get back in because that $6k floor is still in effect
@_date: 2018-07-18 00:36:03
Here’s how this is going to work.
1) you will all FOMO into Bitcoin when it keeps rising, afraid of missing out on gains
2) I will sit with cash on the sidelines
3) Bitcoin will drop back to $6k
4) You will be mad
5) You will panic sell your Bitcoin to me at the price I wanted to buy it in the first place

This is probably the best Reddit advice ever

I also use BofA. No problems.
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:58:56
Yup, impressive selection too 
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:29:28
Man I am cheering for like 2k BTC haha. Floor seems to be about 6k, we’ve bounced away from there a couple of times now
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:27:42
This. If I get 4x (never mind 7x) from today I will be thrilled. That would be 28,000.
If you bought at 1,000 a year ago? You should be thrilled! 7x in one year is a home run and never forget it lol.
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:34:22
Your time horizon is way too short. Lots of people on this sub have owned Bitcoin for at least a year. At $6,600/BTC, those dudes were still up 6x from a year ago yesterday.
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:09:31
Why are you such a brat?
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:13:48
Thank you for selling, I bought my last chunk at about $6600 ��
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:28:20
Ugh don’t talk to me I am still bag holding from 17k ��
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:21:24
Yeah but I’m here for lunatic returns at risk of losing everything. If it hits 2k that would mean “no, it’s not safe” which means potential for über volatility is still in the market. That’s what I want, haha.
