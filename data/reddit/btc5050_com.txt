We will buy an entry for each of the first 3 email addresses that show up in our Reddit message inbox! [EDIT] All gone.

The prize pot seems to be stuck at 0.25BTC. There are many outstanding tickets that haven't been validated yet. We want to hear what you guys want to do. Should we continue to wait, or pull the trigger now and draw a winner for 0.25BTC?

Above comment is also sketchy, as we have recieved zero requests for entries since we launched last night. 
Your email address is used for two reasons: 1. Your name. That way you can use a throw away email if you want to remain anonymous. 2. To send you a Bitcoin payment request. We do not ask you for, or send, Bitcoin addresses via email. That's foolish. The payment request you receive will include a link to process a secure transaction on Coinbase.
Yes, there are other raffle options out there, but the prize pot to entry ratio is not as high as BTC5050. Also, if you want to line the pockets of site owners who are already well-established and wealthy, please use other sites.  is run by a few friends trying to pay our tuition. One of us even has a 2 yr old son! We mine for btc 24/7 as well, but we thought this would be an effective and fun way to generate some income, and match that income for one lucky entry. 
Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.

The Mt. Gox trading fees are low, but every means by which you fund your Mt. Gox account has a fee associated with it. Coinbase allows an ACH transfer directly from a bank account.

It's to set up the Coinbase account. We use Coinbase because they have such great security practices. You can use a throw away email. We don't use them for anything else. We keep email addresses only as long as a raffle is running, then they are all chucked. The only info we keep is for winners. We store a unique hash based on the winners email address, and that winner's prize that will be displayed on a winner's wall, as soon as we get our first winner!

We are currently building a new type of raffle game. It should be interesting to see how you guys like it. We will announce it on r/Bitcoin when it launches.

Just got a good question in our inbox... You tell if your entry hash is validated after you complete the BTC transaction by looking at the player's table at the bottom of the site. The first few characters of your entry hash will show up within 5mins of your BTC posting.

If we keep getting feedback like yours, we can certainly put up smaller games. If we see the demand, there may be a milli.BTC5050.com and/or micro.BTC5050.com in the future. Good suggestion. Thanks for the input!

Our next Raffle will be orders of magnitude smaller: Pot limit 0.01BTC, with entry 0.0005BTC. Thanks for playing everyone! Good luck!
