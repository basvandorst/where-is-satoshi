Okay gran, why are you on the virtual Internet that doesn't exist again? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:37:56
Neo pays dividends. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:45:10
It's impractical. I'd sure love having gold compared to centralized inflationary shitcoins like USD or EUR. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:48:16
Hes probably hoarding fiat and telling people around how the government is backing this so its cool. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:23:56
hence CENTRALIZED shitcoin in my comment. If you don't realize the benefits of bitcoin as a truly trustless and decentralized, without a central monetary authority, why are you even into crypto? But, why am I casting pearls... Do your own research, believe in whatever asset you see fit
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:43:17
Yep this is what new people in cryptos don't get. Buying shit with CC is pretty easy and fast. But this is not what Bitcoin or crypto should be solving. Fiat money, fractional reserve and central banking are bubbles going to burst.

Can't upvote enough. I'd gold you but my cryptos ain't high enough yet. I imagine as it would be the next step; direct exchange, precious metals, backed fiat, unbacked fiat and finally crypto. Probably some of the top cryptos today and maybe a few new ones would fill that "bedrock" role so value would be measured against them in the future. I'd say XMR will probably play a huge role in the upcoming events because of its privacy features. And a few others because they fill a specific niche.

Bitcoin would eventually probably stabilize in terms of purchase power, but theoretically it can only increase in value against ever devaluing (with ability to inflate further without gold backing) fiat. Why shouln't legal tender be a floating market value and without ability for central authority to issue more? IMHO central banking system and last resort lender policies are total bullshit.

Zimbabwe dollar was indeed due to inflation... 
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:39:30
yea well I meant I more like what data tied to a single tx or wallet are stored
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:14:37
I'm not sure since I did everything in coinomi wallet. They have a really quick guide and is generally great app to use, supports multiple coins like btc and btc cash, ether and numerous others. Although there should be import or restore option somewhere in electrum. You can always reinstall or try going create new wallet, maybe there you're presented with restore option. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:49:23
So you own a single wallet now, with both coins on it. Download BTC only wallet, electrum or whatever you prefer and import your key, that's now your BTC wallet. Now do the same with BCC only wallet, but make SURE you trust the app/company you're importing your seed to. This would then become your BCC wallet. There you go, coins split. But I guess transaction would work too. It's pretty hard to fuck up since transactions or each chain are made incompatible with the other, so no replay danger.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:49:26
as I thought. There's a lot of FUD being spread on the Internet about btc not being anonymous and similar claims. Basically unless you disclose an address as yours via bank transfer buying or whatever other way, it's pretty damn anonymous... 
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:36:38
What exchanges can i dump bcash on? Any simple stuff like Shapeshift? No verification and id and such nonsense
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:41:20
What exchanges to deposit and sell BCH on? Also are you hodling or selling out BCH? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:46:20
Yes, of course, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:46:00
thanks!

He helped people set up HW wallets or something, chill out, handout man. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 06:41:13
if by private keys, you mean my seeds safely secured offline in multiple places, then yes, they are safe. I wouldn't spend anything before the dust settles 
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:23:30
Just because they didnt maximize their profit and squeeze every dollar out of it, doesn't mean its a bad product.
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:44:11
it is a lot yea, but for the convenience and anonymity of service, it's not that much a jump from traditional wire transfers or exchanges. Also you don't need to own a bank account. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:02:45
Sums up my views nicely too, I'm not American but I support Trump so far as well despite his imperfections. I'd love to see libertarian minarchist societies in my lifetime. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:29:20
What are exact requirements for my coins to be safe in case of a split (and generally) long term? I'm in similar case as OP. PC, android and paper wallets are an option. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:28:13
Upward I think
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:15:06
I'll just encrypt text with my 4096bit key and save on persistent. so my weakest link is phone, but i got 2 backups and i really take care of my phone so i guess im solid
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:43:52
ATMs are definitely easiest, especially to OP is not buying much so ATM fees are not that relevant. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:31:00
I've bought on bitacsess btc machine. basically you scan your qr for address and put the cash in. Coins are soon enough on your wallet. Just the fees are a bit higher than wire transfer for example. 
fees in my country are about 3 to 5 percent for exchanges and 7 to 9 on BTMs
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:11:48
ok so basically just keep my seed safe and don't spend during the risky time. got it. about other security precautions, will it suffice? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:34:51
You're probably fine doing this, as long you're not making it too big and a business out of it. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:03:38
i have my Mycelium seed on paper and I'll also put it on persistent tails. 2 copies of 12 word seed. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:22:34
yea it's mainly for storage. I don't plan on having more time than 1 or 2 transactions per year
