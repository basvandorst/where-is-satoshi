So, I know the pain of wanting my money now but can't have it because of something like this.
But what you don't seem to realize is they're dealing with a secure platform.  You don't just hack together some code and release it into the public on something like this.  Even if it's two lines, it needs to be investigated, the changes impact needs to be assessed, the changes need to be tested and then it needs integration/regression/security testing.  Then it can be deployed safely.  But even then, deployments need to be scheduled and done safely.  On top of other work already in progress, I'd say 6 weeks is actually fairly good.
No one is just hacking the backend to get YOUR 50 BTC while they hold thousands for others that could be put at risk somehow by a new change.  That would make me want to leave their company, not that you had to wait a few weeks.

WTF, it's the six-fingered man
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:49:22
Of course

Man, once I emailed BOA support on how to deposit my bitcoins into my bank account.  The guy on the other end must have been super confused because he outlined a way for me to make deposits.  Eventually it turned into a "we don't support Bitcoin deposits YET."

That is actually a great idea for people to fund homeless pets

I use VPN for work to connect to our internal networks.  See you all in prison, we can create a new coin that we'll back with cigarettes.  All the hashing will be done on paper.  I'll keep the blockchain in my cell.  Don't worry, you can trust me.
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:28:26
We need more carts to show the bitcoin fluctuation
@_date: 2016-06-08 21:55:29
VPN is required for so many people to do their jobs.  It would shove a cactus up the ass of the IT world.
@_date: 2016-11-15 05:45:44
Yeah, literally.  I know of 4 ATMs in my area.

For anyone who uses Coinbase for business, this feature is a god send.  I paid someone way too much money to do this for my business last year using a regular wallet to collect coins.
@_date: 2016-11-15 16:13:13
It was always a whole lot of "oh wow man, I never knew anything about that."  "So it's like actual money or something?"
Most people were fairly open minded about it though.  I only came across one other Bitcoin enthusiast in public.
@_date: 2016-11-14 18:48:56
What about those of us who pay for it over several months?  We need a better calculation to match price fluctuation at payment time.
Could you please provide a more accurate calculator?

I do other silly things, like, wear my sidehack campaign tshirt around town.

My apologies, I posted two statements about mining today and replied with the wrong statement here as that information wasn't provided in this post.
I would reconcile every day.  So I wasn't holding, there was no foresight in those days for noobs like I was.  We lived in fear that our investments would be squashed by the government.  
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:12:34
What he posted will work, but it's not obvious that it satisfies your requirements.
Since it will deploy a linux system and you explicitly stated "on windows"
It is definitely an option though.
However, setting up the windows system is much easier than you think.  It's literally, 
1. install expert bundle. 
2. Configure TOR.
3. Install Bitcoin Core
4. Configure Bitcoin Core to use Socks5 Proxy (ie, your tor proxy)

Yeah, then I explain I'm using it to order a contract killer on silk road.
@_date: 2016-11-14 18:50:13
Imagine being this guy
@_date: 2016-12-16 03:14:06
I haven't been following this for a long time.  But I was under the impression that Ross was busted trying to hire a contract killer.  Was this proven false?
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:59:31
I do that for white elephant parties.  I buy whatever the cap is for the gifts in Bitcoins and give away a paper wallet with instructions on how to import it and use it.
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:15:10
Props for that project.
Now if you can build a bitmessenger out of an old blackberry, I'll love you forever.  Otherwise I own't love you forever.

TL;DR - I feel you
I run a business that had some customers setup with recurring payments via coinbase.  After they stopped using my services, I deleted the recurring payment.  It appeared as deleted in my account, but never stopped sending the notifications.  I contacted them, they didn't do anything about it.
My coinbase account is now frozen, because I didn't comply with their weird invasive list of demands, but my former customers still receive notifications that they owe me money.  I know this because I get the notification that they're being billed still... it's super awkward because they keep asking me to stop it... but there's literally nothing I can do.

In all honesty, I think it's the case of a company that grew too fast.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:02:51
Yeah, if it were only that easy when you deal in large amounts of Bitcoins.  You have to track each transaction from time you gained to time you sold.  Using a desktop client that isn't easy.
You obviously lack the experience, but still felt the need to say something stupid.  Good job.
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:55:06
Download the expert bundle, it will give you just the tor proxy, no browser.
Configure that and point your node at it in the network settings.
Post back if you need more info.

This guy is now pinning addresses to your usernames and creating FBI profile on you so you can be sent to the libertarian death camps.
@_date: 2016-11-10 07:21:14
I'm gonna say it again
@_date: 2016-12-01 23:14:00
If you setup bitcoin core to use a proxy, it will not connect unless the proxy is working.

Posts like this always challenge my confidence in my spelling without sufficient amounts of coffee.

Is there any data on what % of transactions are suspected to be related to terrorism?
Is there any data contrast with Bitcoin Terror Funding vs Old World Money Terror Funding?  In terms of trading commodities as well like guns and munitions in place of cash, gold or other currency.
I think using the "using Bitcoin to fund terrorism gives us a reason to break this encryption" needs to be debunked.
@_date: 2016-09-18 21:48:09
You can use Bitcoin for Craigslist sales.  So I don't understand the comparison.  
@_date: 2016-09-06 19:31:25
So many people missed it...

Preaching to the choir here.
It would be better x-posted to like Canada's official sub.

Maybe this guy is right and it's the government pushing for bigger block sizes so they could then push us into this very situation where they can choke us out.

Man, at first I almost shit my pants because I thought it was fucking Putin until my eyes focused.

Not only this, but I have my credit card wrongly decline so much these days.  It's so annoying... not to mention chip cards that don't work.  Or declined due to where it's routing through.

Are you and jcnike the same person?

Oh cool, Satoshi mains Caitlyn.

Fuck man, I was sitting here waiting for it to do something... 
@_date: 2016-07-28 23:12:00
for a seller, you avoid giving up 3% or more of your sale to the credit card companies.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:51:33
The one thing I really like about Bitcoin.  You can't skim me at checkout.
Even if the bank will give your money back, it is a hassle and you could still be broke for a few days when you really need something like groceries.

Coinbase is a shithole.
