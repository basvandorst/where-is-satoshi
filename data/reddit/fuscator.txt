Lightning network has started to evolve on the mainnet already. So we'll soon see how the predictions turn out. 
I don't think it will work for the general case, the split of funds is the main issue. Saying that will get me downvoted here. The cool thing is, all of this is recorded so we'll soon see who was correct.

Check this guy who thinks more than 0.1% of people spend their BTC rather than HODL.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:46:20
Except, I don't understand the use case here. If you transfer BTC from one exchange to another, the likelihood is because you want to sell that BTC for another currency (otherwise why are you doing it). But can you sell that BTC without settling to the main chain which involves an on chain transaction anyway?
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:40:43
Ban? How? They've legitimised crypto by regulating exchanges and taking tax money from people who have sold. Banning crypto will destroy a lot of wealth for a lot of people who only bought because it was legitimate to do so. I don't think they can do it now.

There are coins (not BCH) that keep decentralisation and scale on chain. What is the problem with that? If one of these had been first mover, you'd have no problem with it. The issue is that people are religious about bitcoin.

Everything in crypto is about the network effect. Bitcoin has that advantage at the moment because it was first. But this space is changing so fast and in the meantime alt coins are springing up that do crypto better than bitcoin. So what happens if we wait a year more for LN and it turns out that the distribution of channels doesn't work (as the simulations are starting to show) and then we have to wait another few years for the next second layer? At that point, another coin has solved the problems using on chain technology, has a larger market cap, more users and bitcoin is now an alt.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:46:33
Same question.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:50:29
The is absolutely no incentive for a miner to do this. They will ruin their own business model and they somehow have to offload that crypto into fiat, at a point where it'll be worthless because no-one will be buying a crypto that got corrupted.

The good news is that transactions are getting cheaper again! 
(In USD)
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:56:25
It's actually good news. They're giving it legitimacy by forcing regulation. That means it is impossible for them to ban it in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:04:45
The British government are fast turning from fairly liberal to one of the more authoritarian governments around. I get sad about this at times.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:35:06
Not really solved. You need an on chain transaction to settle to bitcoins still. Si you've gained nothing.

How do you get funded in this channel? Who is sending you bitcoin that already has an open LN channel? Your employee isn't going to be paying you in bitcoin, probably not ever, and not in the next 10 years. I certainly don't have anyone who regularly wants to top me up with bitcoin. If you buy more, that requires an on channel transaction, so fees again.
It doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:52:47
Nothing that he said is technically incorrect. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:02:36


How much of their citizens wealth will they wipe out with that move? How many people have put their wealth into bitcoin because governments have implicitly sanctioned it by demanding KYC checks on exchanges. To turn around and say "sorry, we were wrong to do that, we should have just banned it instead, oh well" doesn't strike me as a great move.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:42:22
That's not really the point for me. The point is this is just another finance world money grab. We don't need bitcoin futures, they serve no purpose except to make money for CME in charges. Currently, if you want to partake in bitcoin, you have to own bitcoin, which increases the usage and yes also the price. So early investors and regular people benefit from the increased adoption. 
With CME introducing futures it means people can partake without ever owning a bitcoin, which means the money is redirected to the establishment and away from actual bitcoin.
It's a shit development.

In order to be able to transact with multiple people over a period of time, you'll have to know your rough spending habits over that period of time. You'll then need to connect to a node with a big enough balance sheet to open a channel for that amount (lets say that amount is $2000 per month). Perhaps game theory will play out such that the system will match you with other users who also want to spend a roughly similar amount so you agree to both open a channel for $2000, but more likely is that most people will end up going through super-nodes. These nodes will be relatively centralised.
You also still haven't solved the problem of base layer scaling because if people want to open and close channels once a month, and there are 1 billion people using the system, you'll need to process roughly 770 transactions a second on the base layer provided they're all staggered evenly across the month and people only open and close once a month. 
And that excludes other on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:26:21
As interest in bitcoin rises and number of transactions increase, does anyone see any short term solution for the high fees and wait times on transactions? I regard LN as a possible medium to long term solution. What do we do for the next year or so until it goes mainstream? Even segwit adoption would help only so much.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:53:18
And how many transactions will this generate on the main chain if say 1% of the world's population use it? Hint, the answer is about 54 transactions a second. Far more than currently.

I work in the finance industry. It has a real bravado culture. Bitcoin is a threat to the "alpha male" and it wouldn't surprise me if there is an organised attempt to crush it through manipulative trading strategies.

People won't spend a deflationary asset while they're getting paid in inflationary fiat. 100% certain.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:24:47
If it's nothing then why is bitcoin blockchain not coping with far less than that right now? You *can* leave channels open indefinitely but you'd have to fund it sufficiently up front. Is this the way you see a replacement money working? I don't. I think people will put smaller amounts and settle to main chain more frequently, which means we will need to scale the main chain.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:38:48
There is an almost zero chance that people in most countries are going to get paid in bitcoin over.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:25:40
Which is what has already happened anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:06:32
Ok, bury your head in the sand. I'm interested in debate not blind faith.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:06:58
Because they redirect investment from bitcoin and ordinary people into the hands of the establishment finance system. Exactly the problem bitcoin is meant to solve. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:26:23
I'm afraid I didn't follow up. Maybe I'll try the process again. Did your housemate solve it?

When reality doesn't suit your narrative, simply rebrand reality as FUD. Job done. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:09:23
How? Lightning network is still going to need a transaction verified to open a channel and new buyers are still going to want to move bitcoin to  wallets. We still need on chain transactions and they need to be affordable.Bitcoin has no choice at all but to increase blocksize.
@_date: 2018-05-31 07:22:30
Hey there. I'm thinking of starting a small business for which I can send you the prospectus. However, I lack enough capital. What is the mechanism for lending me that capital using bitcoin, in return for me paying you back the capital over time plus an extra amount for the risk you took?
@_date: 2018-05-31 10:47:05
No, I can't. Once I "loan" bitcoin, it is gone with no mechanism to recover it if the person disappears. So this is a genuine question, does a facility exist right now to borrow bitcoin at interest? If not, could we describe how such a system could exist?
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:37:38
Let's assume I have 0.1 BTC currently. I open a channel to someone (a hub presumably) for 0.1 BTC. I pay the on-chain fees to do so. I use those funds to pay for some stuff. How do I get more BTC into that channel? I'm not selling anything so no-one is paying me over LN. Do I buy the BTC from someone and again pay the on-chain fees to top up to 0.1 again? Describe the cycle here, in some sort of detail please, because so far I haven't seen anyone describe how it will work.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:11:57
How does it create more wealth? It transfers wealth but I can't see that it has created anything yet.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:49:24
Why was it overvalued? By what metric can you make that statement?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:39:18
Exactly. Therefore the price could be $30k per bitcoin tomorrow with enough speculative demand. It can't be overvalued when the value is simply a function of demand and nothing else. The price at this time is always the correct price.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:29:03
Thanks, I'll give that a go.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:52:31
Banks are not a place to store money. They are intermediaries to capital allocation. You agree to loan them the money and they in turn loan it out to people who need immediate capital. If you destroy that you're negatively impacting most of the world.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:47:42
That would be 99.5% of the worlds population. I thought BTC was meant to replace fiat?
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:00:53
Apart from 99% of people.
@_date: 2018-02-16 09:42:13
Because your money is at risk. Do you advise people who don't understand bitcoin or wallets to understand or ignore all the tech?
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:49:06
Trying to get into the space across several hundred different options, and more every month. Despite what this sub thinks doing some additional reading shows that a lot of new investors are choosing other coins over bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:53:39
Crypto transacts across infrastructure that was paid for by everyone. Governments create rules by proxy, which means on behalf of everyone, and you vote them out if you don't like it. 
This means governments have the power and authority to legislate on cryptos.
Sadly.
