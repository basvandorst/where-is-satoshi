That's only true for clients that broadcast transactions directly onto the p2p network. A custom client can do whatever it wants, including submitting the transactions directly to a certain miner.
This goes along with a legal agreement between wallet developer A and miner B, where in exchange for a fee B is granted exclusive rights to all transactions from A's users for a certain period of time after they get submitted (say n blocks, where n is some small number). If B mines n more blocks but fails to include the tx in any of them, then as a failsafe, A will broadcast it on p2p, after which it would go to any random miner as usual.


Well, it's limited by the miners' software.... really they can include any valid transactions they want. Numerous mining operations diverge from the reference miner in the way they select transactions, and get along fine.

Also consider that mining is not equally profitable everywhere in the world, not just due to operating expenses but also due to taxes.
So a variation of your question would be: why run a miner anywhere on earth but in the country that offers the most incentives to do so? (Think flags of convenience on ships, or US businesses incorporating in Delaware/North Dakota).
I think you're right about the dangers of economically centralized mining, but less talked about is the possibility of geographic centralization--which could have equally bad or worse consequences, IMO.

Well, miners could be said to be middlemen.
A wallet app maker could make an arrangement with a specific miner, then proxy all the app's transactions through said miner in exchange for a cut of the miner's earnings.
Obviously, if users could choose their own wallet app then that would decrease the potential earnings from such an arrangement.
It's conceivable Apple is keeping third-party wallet apps off iOS with the intent of releasing their own payment app--iCash or whatever--that supports bitcoin.

You can go to the OCC's [Customer Assistance Group]( and file a complaint. The bank is required to respond in writing, both to you and the gov. There's no way around this rule, even if your name is Chase.
Now, Chase will not be obliged to re-open your account, but this way you can pin them down on an official response while also creating some extra work for them. (**edit:** and it really is extra work... probably for someone in corp HQ actually).

I'd hope they would be smarter than that!
The Koch brothers could be said to be anti-government too, yet they're not shy about using every lever of government power to advance their interests. There's a lesson there...

Maybe a set of trustworthy DVD images for your preferred distro (centOS, debian). Whatever packages you need on top of the base system, install them from DVD.
There might be tools you need that aren't provided by the distro. [Some of them]( might be good candidates for OCR.

South Park would poke a little bit of fun at bitcoin and/or its fans, and there would be much butthurt round these parts.

The irony would be perfect, too -- a bunch of anarchistic/libertarian crypto nerds giving an award to a bunch of government crypto nerds...

From her remarks, one would have no idea that the **actual regulator**, who happens to be seated at the **very same table**, had spent yesterday's hearing saying, no, bitcoin mostly fits into our existing frameworks, and we're quite capable of dealing with bitcoin, and most criminals and terrorists don't like to use it anyway.

Don't mean to toot my own horn, but I think I predicted at least [some]( of this. 
As PGP's Phil Zimmerman put it, there's an act of acquiescence in making any prediction. The best way not to have one come true, is for people to stop acquiescing.

Things don't vanish when they go into a real-life sink, either. The word usage is apt.

Thank you!

Thanks for the perspective. I understand that there are countermeasures against being tracked via pure block-chain analysis (but even then, you'd have to ask how trustworthy your mixing service is. Someone with an exhaustive log of internal mixing activity could render the mixing much less effective, afaik. And the compliance department of any established exchange like Mt.Gox will happily turn over your trading records and payout/funding history to numerous parties, if those parties ever want to unmask you).
But beyond that there's a lot of data that's not part of the block chain, that correlates to events that are in the block chain. Internet activity logs, phone conversations, email exchanges. Even if you're exchanging BTC offline, someone can still watch you do it, and record that information in their own "big-data" annotated block chain, if you will. Every non-empty wallet has its public address appear at least once in the blockchain, so this is a game of assigning probabilities that a given event in the real world involves a given keypair. One doesn't have to do much better than random chance in order for that knowledge to be useful to someone (and in order for "anonymity" to be much reduced).
Granted, this is a problem caused more by pervasive surveillance than by bitcoin itself, and I'd concede your point that if offline wallets became the dominant means of exchanging BTC, then they could offer much better privacy.
Not very familiar (yet) with the mechanics of BTC coloring, but will take you at your word. Bitcoin, like any protocol, is a mechanism; it doesn't determine the policies that will influence the actual use of bitcoins. (A country cracking down on tax evasion, or simply trying to build up a bitcoin economy, could offer a tax amnesty on bitcoins, on the condition that those bitcoins be mixed with special, colored bitcoins. Even if you could separate the two after the fact, and create a purely non-colored wallet, you'd lose your amnesty on those btc, so there would be an incentive not to, etc. etc.). So it will be interesting to see how things develop on the policy axis.
On your last point, agreed that alt-coins are not any more or less anonymous in the long run. Even the temporary advantage of being less coupled to events in the real world (by virtue of there being fewer transactions, and even fewer high-profile ones), and thereby providing less fodder for data mining, will disappear as soon as the currency becomes popular.

Having a true "air gap" system means more than never connecting it to the Internet. Among other things:
* all hardware and media have to be sourced and purchased anonymously
* removable media can *only* be connected to systems that have been so acquired. The only way to get data in from outside world is to enter it manually or use a standalone OCR (not a conventional scanner--afaik these don't exist on the civilian market).
* Everything has to have round-the-clock physical security and be under lock and key when not in use.
If any of these things are missing, it's not really an airgap.
**Edit:** Here's [Schneier]( talking in more detail about some of these issues.

That, and the part about how organized crime prefers centralized digital currency, because it can be based in a country with a regime friendly toward criminal interests. (insert Fed joke here).
So really, quite a strong statement not just in favor of Bitcoin, but p2p exchange in general. Happy dance warranted, I'd say.
