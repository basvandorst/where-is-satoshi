I think a lot of gold ETFs don't pretend to actually hold physical gold to represent their underlying asset value. The reason to buy into a gold ETF for many investors is to diversify and hedge a portfolio by gaining exposure to gold's price movements, and this is done by the ETF mostly by trading futures contracts.

I didn't know you could avoid paying taxes using Bitcoin. Can you explain? I understand that a Bitcoin-based microeconomy might avoid taxes to the extent no bitcoins are ultimately exchanged for dollars to create a taxable transaction, but I don't think we are quite there yet in terms of bitcoin's development. Or do you mean something else? Thanks

Should I be a little worried that the (probable?) creator of Bitcoin seems just a little resentful of credit not being given where it's due? I would have imagined SN to have transcended such mundane emotions :).

A big difference between bitcoin and commodities that you are ignoring is that commodities (like all traditional asset classes) receive very heavy coverage by analysts and the financial press. Bitcoin has come a long way in that regard but it is still not an entirely efficient market.

People are probably buying a lot of bitcoins because of positive news recently, not because of this guy. See, e.g.,

Some would argue that the volatility is necessary for an early-stage currency like Bitcoin. Wences Casares says the following:
"Right now most of the money that is invested in Bitcoin is money people can afford to loose and that makes it safe money. So when Bitcoin goes from $1,200 to $200 there is not a vicious cycle of people who need to sell, because they cannot afford to loose more money, that drives the price to zero.
It is hard to estimate how many people own bitcoins, but it may be somewhere between 13 and 15 million people right now. If Bitcoin is successful we will see hundreds of millions of people own Bitcoin and, eventually, billions. The only way we can get to billions of people owning Bitcoin is by the price going up by several orders of magnitude, let’s say $ 1 million (but this is highly speculative and risky). So, if I am right, and Bitcoin has to go from $390 to $1,000,000 the best way for it to get there without crashing irreversibly is with **as much volatility as possible**. If bitcoin went up a couple percentage points every week and everybody began to think about it as a “sure” thing, investing money that was destined to pay for kids colleges or for retirement, that is a disaster waiting to happen price wise. Because when Bitcoin corrects those people have to sell because they cannot take more losses, potentially creating a vicious circle which is hard to reverse.
Ironically, we have to thank Bitcoin’s volatility for people not investing money they cannot afford to loose. As long as the Bitcoin price remains highly volatile and perceived as risky, we are OK. Begin to worry when it is perceived as a sure thing that everybody should own a lot of."

Forbidden fruit trope doesn't apply in this context. Technically, yes, banning certain high-demand products with value apart from their price (e.g., drugs have use-value for getting high) can make them even scarcer and thus more valuable. Banning a currency directly impacts its value (e.g., currencies have no use-value other than as something that can be used to trade for other products and services, so if one suffers a strong ban then it cannot be easily used in trade), which would thus cause its value to plummet (probably won't go to $0 though if it's still used for illegitimate purposes like in the early days).

She's not going to answer because she doesn't want to be held to any standard of accountability, because any kind of accountability will (1) place her in a bad light (scammer, or scammed) or (2) relieve her of her misguided notion that by answering she gives up some degree of imaginary freedom that these types of crazy anti-statist, tax deniers believe they have.

I'm not sure how what you're saying is in disagreement with my post. Economic data, financial reports and quantitative forecasting, as you say, are all taken into account by people responsible for studying and analyzing (including traders and other "buyers/sellers that can influence the price", and its disingenuous to assume that I made a good faith attempt at enumerating all possible participants in a two sentence reddit post) that particular asset, and most markets are absolutely saturated with institutional knowledge and coverage to which bitcoin pales in comparison. This is why the prevailing wisdom is that mom and pop shouldn't try to "beat the market."
This should not be controversial. Despite your "confidence", it remains true that it is quite possible, even probable, that the halving will continue to move the price of bitcoin simply because not everyone (whether current or prospective holders) understands what the halving even means and what its relevance is with respect to bitcoin (again, this is an inefficient market, and as a general exercise just consider the many ways that high finance, let alone individual investors, misunderstands bitcoin). After all, it's been known for *years* that this next halving (in fact, all halvings) was coming in 2016 or 2017. Do you really think it was completely priced since the early days (if not day 1)? Of course not. All this discussion is hypothetical anyways -- in six months we'll see where the price of bitcoin is (although it won't be easy to control for the impact on the price brought by developments unrelated to the halving).

So how about being held to a higher standard then, if all that is true? Or does an "open source project" not "deserve" to demand higher standards?

But these ignorant retail investors own a non-trivial percentage of bitcoin's market cap (there are very few JPMs or institutional investors investing in bitcoin), and most of them still believe (rightfully so) that bitcoin is an undervalued asset, so as time goes on (but not for much longer) the price will move as a result of these retail investors doing their own research.

I'm probably being hysterical but that really sunk my heart. It would suck if the original motivation for the technology was to create a ponzi scheme / bubble to cash out on (unless it was named tongue-in-cheek). But then I remembered the technology stands on its own. Who cares who created Bitcoin.

Noncorrelation is not a defining feature of safe haven assets. Correlation is relevant to the goal of diversification (and as such is a much more relative concept than the quality of "safe haveness"). As much as I am a Bitcoin enthusiast, a lot of bitcoiners just don't understand basic asset allocation principles and modern portfolio theory. Treasury bills and cash (USD) will for the foreseeable future be more of a safe haven than even gold (let alone Bitcoin), and it's pure sophistry to suggest otherwise (a la "but but but ... evil fed printing press!").

You're still citing fringe cases though. The discussion is about whether this can go mainstream. The odds of bitcoin replacing the top 5 or so government currencies due to hyperinflation are a long ways off.

Aren't remittances and replacement of unstable currencies a good competitive reason? I think people living in countries with the top 5 or so stable (reserve) currencies may have only "ideological" reasons for adopting bitcoin, but there are good competitive reasons why other (especially underdeveloped) countries' populations may very well like the idea of being able to "opt out" of the effects of their central banks' crappy monetary policies.

This. I get a lot of flack from people saying that I'm taking too much risk putting most of my savings into investment grade corporate and municipal bond funds. Then again, we're probably not as risk-averse as your typical saver, given the subreddit we're on. I don't see myself getting anywhere in life without taking some moderate risk with my money.

Right, but the key is that the "average jo" does indeed start using it as a currency and not as a speculative investment. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 23:05:53
Exactly. It's the greed for yield that causes so many of our economic problems. I think over the long-term, just like with any investment with risk-adjusted high returns, it will even out to steady "average annual" growth. In the meanwhile a lot of us will need to adopt a strong mindset to buy, hold and ignore day-to-day volatility.

It's actually not an Achilles heel but in fact a positive feature. Exchange rate risk is an especially dangerous reality for people relying on remittances being sent on an international scale.
