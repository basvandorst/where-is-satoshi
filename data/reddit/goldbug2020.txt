18000 btc dumped at the market in 24 hours, is that organic selling?
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:24:36

Then they should state with whom they have banking relationships

No way of knowing how much of that is just spoof
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:24:16
Because Coinbase is a poorly run exchange ... count on them to do the completely wrong thing, every time, due to complete incompetence

7pm Eastern Time, USA, we switch over to a new daily candle .... I think it will be 8pm now until the autumn
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:14:33
A break above 8600 on the 4 hr should lead to further upside.... just sayin'
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:21:13
So how does this go now with Daylight Savings Time .... is the daily close now at 8pm Eastern Time (USA) ???
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:49:32
Yes .... and look at the size of the wick on yesterdays daily candle ..... thats massive buying pressure that was able to lift us back over the 200 day .... then we continued with more upside to 9400 .... pausing here a bit ... there is also a longterm downward trendline at about 9400 .... its going to take a little to get over it ...

Just the 11:30 AM selloff at the close of the European equity markets .... it has happened 5 of the last 6 days .... check out the article on the Zero Hedge site .... 
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:09:15
Its the nominal close for the trading day. The following trading day begins immediately .... there is no actual stoppage of trading, but there has to be some delineation, otherwise, you could not define the candles to construct a daily chart
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:17:17
If we "retest" 6k we are going lower .... theres no such thing as a double bottom ... if you think we are going back to 6k and bouncing you are 100% wrong ... it can happen, but only extremely rarely ..... Gox sold the coins he was authorized to sell, no more, and judging from the backlash, its likely he will sell future coins through private placement in order to maximize revenue .... if you are a trustee with fuduciary responsibility, selling large blocks with market orders is likely the stupidest thing you can do .... there is chatter that he will be sued by plaintiff groups seeking compensation from Mt Gox ....  usa tarrifs mean fuck-all, there is zero correlation between BTC and traditional markets ... you have no idea what sentiment is, you have no idea what "a lot of people" will do,
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:24:11
Dont send any coin anywhere until you are 1000% certain, otherwise you will lose everything .... also, when sending to a new address, always send a small amount like $10 first and see that everything goes ok

If we get over 9450 and hold we can avoid a death cross on the daily

He will not sell in the market again. A private sale outside of the market will net much more money. He was widely criticized for lack of fiduciary responsibility

On the TradingView candlestick chart, when you hover over the candle in any timeframe, the field at the top of the chart will give you the numbers for the open, high, low, and close for that candle
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:17:09
Over the resistance at 8300 .... now bumping up against the longtime downward trendline .... very bullish ....

I am wondering how long it will be before Reddit shuts down the cryptocurrency message boards .... I saw news yesterday that they shut down all of the firearm and gun related boards .... I guess when they perceive that Cryptos represent freedom they will shut them down as well ...
