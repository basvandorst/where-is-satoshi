How about running your PC off a Ubuntu CD? As far as I know you cannot save much on Windows partition this way (and vice versa.). Or more conveniently, if I had a Ubuntu partition, how likely it is anyone breaks in there through Windows being online?

It's becoming very difficult to find an exchange that actually works, is not too dodgy and accepts new accounts. Lately I figured I am buying Litecoins from Coinbase and move them to Binance to buy whatever I actually need. I managed to get onto Binance, buy my friend was less lucky two days later.

We need people to take payments in Litecoin because it's a £0.10 transfer fee. (:

Bitcoin is a bubble and it's popping sometimes and then recovering perfectly and beyond, growing in value over long term. Not bad for a bubble! How many bubble pops can you hodl for. ;)

Sample size is a sum of all the POINTS in those three graphs. You could assume very roughly, there's 90 daily points in a graph, that's sample size of 270 + 16 days this year. And then you could find out whats the correlation between price and day of a year or simplify the hell of it using moving averages. Of course no one ran that through Excel but anyone who passed 1 or 2 semesters in statistics can probably say this makes at least some sense. You can tell by eye these are correlated. Why is everyone so negative! :D

My average price is same but in British pounds.. don't worry mate probably these will be called low prices in a couple months

Yeah and I just came from work :( We should do more BTC crashes in the late evening.

If you want to take part in the BTC community, there's a lot of stuff to read so prices are affected by different events, forks and other cryptos.

Hi I am having a very rough ride with getting my 2nd ID approved but in my (less obvious) case that's because Coinbase are too silly to understand you can be a UK resident with a non-uk citizenship yet still you hold a UK driving license because you're not a tourist. I send them many documents and I'm stuck now.
As much as I try to avoid the negative attribution I think Coinbase wants you to buy Crypto at bad rates that they offer (so they accept your 1st ID) but they don't want you to go to GDAX.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:31:22

Coinbase wants you to HODL! If I'm from UK, how do I cash out when the day comes? I heard that Coinbase can be reluctant to send me my own money. Is TESCO going to start accepting LTC so I spend it all on groceries? Or... what if TESCO implements Segwit before Coinbase?

I read their official announcement regarding Segwit, it sounded like a corporate way to say Segwit is a fancy decoration that they don't need because they are so concerned about speed and safety. (I didn't say it!!!) Did I miss something?

Businesses are droping BTC and that's okay because transaction fee of £12 was a joke. Now we are at some £4 (if that's correct) so it's starting to look good. They will need to come back to taking BTC payments. Soon it may be more popular than ever before. Think about Microsoft, they removed BTC and the re-enabled it. I will be getting pizzas with Bitcoin, just need to be patient for a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:23:08
That's crazy you've been downvoted so many times. Very interesting post and in my opinion, makes a lot of sense. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:46:27
Interesting. I thought it crashed around Christmas then recovered and a few days ago peaked slightly higher. Average is looking healthy but please do sell your coins I am still waiting for the price drop so they are cheap as dirt ��

If there are two possible events, probability for each of them is 0.5 ... it will either happen or not! On a serious note, if something happened three times in a row for similar reasons, safe to assume it's more likely to happen again, than not.

It's always hard to buy back in. If it's not broken, don't fix it.

Just shrug and tell them you're looking for the moment to buy (cost-averaging).

Yeah secure, last time worked okay.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:35:21
I know something that worked but it's a bit radical.
Send an email through the website again (not straight to email address) and put something like "Final Request" in the title. Ask for help and set a deadline in 1-2 weeks, say you will remove your account if no help is required. Good to make sure you have $0.00 on your Coinbase account and delete your card information.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:34:15
No way

No one will guarantee Bitcoin is a good idea however if you look at moving averages, it may give you some good feeling about it, eg. 
Generally it is a super volatile market that I would recommend only for keeping spare money. If I lose some of it (or most) I'll be okay but I'm enjoying a chance to gain. (or maybe gain a lot?)
Yes British Pound is not the best "coin" due to the Brexit vote and my guess is it will keep on losing value (and so does London housing market) As my friend said; Brexit had quite a lot of consequences for something that has not happened. 
I would probably diversify savings into:
1. Another European currency
2. Some part of it into Bitcoin (depending on your risk tolerance)
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:52:48
Unlimited financial bubbles! Bitcoin can crash as many times as it wants and it's always fun.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:22:52
That's right but does CPU/GPU ability increase always mean increased power consumption? When we talk 'energy consumpion', I believe people actually think about the fishes and the trees, not the amount on a power bill. And so it is not a problem that someone will need to pay a lot purchasing a quantum mining rig. Carbon footprint or air pollution are the real real costs we worry about. (but as I said above in my opinion nothing to worry about)
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:17:43
Historical data is on our side, there were many scary dips and official deaths of BTC. Your 2013 coins must be worth quite a bit though - regardless on what price we are at.

@_date: 2018-02-11 11:08:07
I believe the cost of computing power will decrease over time as it always did, we'll need smaller power supplies to do bigger calculations. Did you hear about places preferred by miners? Some of them are eg. next to hydroelectric power plant, using energy that we could call wastage, since humans are not good at storing large amounts of electricity yet. Plus economy drives it - energy bill determines if you can mine at all.
Ultimately, security is the value behind BTC and I also agree POW is here to stay. It's what makes blockchain amazing and is why BTC will not hit 0.00. it will take people like Nouriel Roubini a moment or a few to understand.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:01:11

Of course. It is about observation and understanding the environment. And not some theoretical constraints or comparing it with what Wall Street do. Bitcoin will probably stabilise as it becomes more mature but now it looks promising.

That's a crazy volatile wild west type of market. Make sure you wanna do it. And step to is you need to buy low and sell high. And it's less obvious than it may seem �� The advisor doesn't exist. It takes a crystal ball to predict price movement.

Always think it's a bit tricky to identify bubble stages in Crypto, it's a very special asset so maybe we just can have endless cycles of inflating and bursting bubbles? Nothing to worry about because historically each of the Bitcoins 49585 bubbles bursts at a higher price.
Ok I checked Dow Jones this aftrnoon and I caught it red handed as it tightly followed the handbook bubble stages. I'm not very serious about it all, just for the laugh. And dedicated to my corporate stock trading friend who said crypto was a bubble. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:25:39
Why? It's the market now (a young one). If you used DJIA percentages in a crypto conversation you are not relevant and not to be taken seriously too. 
I mean, we'll see how it goes for stock market, at the moment it looks like it wants to become Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:35:55

First I read BBC Paranoia program about BTC.


What are your expectations regarding this? Will it pump, or could it actually introduce more uncertainty? I haven't figure what is British media stance on crypto, apart from the fact I noticed people willingly put the mouth where the money is - and not the other way.
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:08:47
East Europe, they were always too tough to need it. Very surprised they do now though. ��

Some alts could but BTC cannot crash to zero. Even if everything went the worst possible way, many people will want to have at least one full Bitcoin just for the joy of it. That's a value of its own. And another reason, they are a limited supply. The practical zero for Bitcoin would be far above where TRX is today.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:21:39
Yes, wallet backups get easily confused with the actual money being a file on a computer. And the general public would definitely use a good explanation of mining.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:28:41
They don't but certain event may be more or less likely to happen which we usually estimate using the past events because this is the best we can without a crystal ball.
It's more about understanding the risk, the likelihood or good and bad scenarios and just not investing too much.
