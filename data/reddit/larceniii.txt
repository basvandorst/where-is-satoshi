Neo Branch Grand Opening
This week’s branch-opening received a terrific response from the general public. Attendees were amazed with the quality of the space and appreciated how much more educated they became after learning more about Bitcoin from our team. We opened many customer accounts, however, due to the MtGox situation, we withheld the sale of bitcoins temporarily to avoid immediate “loss” for customers that day and to keep focus on Neo and the benefits of Bitcoin.
This decision is not something that will be repeated in the future, it was a decision taken because we had not commenced operations at the time of the uncertainty surrounding MtGox.
Here are some photos from the event:

How would you do it?
I know Bitcoin and crypto, but I mean, HOW exactly to we get from point A to point B? 
Would the first step be Government buy in of Bitcoin? 
And is there enough to go around?
Conceptually I can the see government issuing its own crypto backed by BTC.
Im not suggesting that, just trying to imagine what the government would do.
It would probably be a shitty tether clone.

In my honest, uninformed opinion, I think this gives them the right to censor the internet, in such a way to say that a protocol like Bitcoin's traffic, isn't "Real" standard traffic, by their own made up definition, and thusly ISP's will be able to block non http traffic because it's not an industry recognized standard. A rouge protocol in my own words. Under the guise of killing botnets, it could also impact legitimate but non standard communications.  
Point in case it enables them to have authority to make changes that would impact bitcoin, even if indirectly. I maybe wrong, I only know that it places us consumers in a worse position.
At best, it's very unclear what powers it does grant and that's never a good thing.

Well spoken, not all regulation is bad. It just so happens that regulations start out with good intentions, and then mega corps twist regulations into barriers to deter smaller competition from encroaching into their markets.
I call this a paper wall. And regulations are not a guarantee for consumer safety. As if the regulated companies meet the requirements technically but implement them poorly it doesn't matter much.
Example: they have a firewall, so the regulation may be met, but if it's being bypassed so employees can look at porn, then it's just an epic fail.

|Cenk was not speaking ill will of Bitcoin in the slightest.
Saying that he [who had purchased the bitcoins] originally bought bitcoins because he was going to buy drugs does not normally make people want to jump on board with bitcoins. How on earth could you not understand that? 
His "Shock and Awe" was at the absurdity and stupidity of some people who despite how dumb they are, luck out. That is shocking. He thinks it's shockingly stupid to buy bitcoins, and stupid that they are worth so much. He said bitcoins are stupid, without saying bitcoins are stupid.

Why does everyone in the media pointlessly name drop silkroad?
I know what it is. You know what it is, everyone knows what it is. 
I've never been to, or even seen silkroad, nor do I care to. I have used tor for years, and now I can't help but feel it's been tainted by all this.
I use bitcoin for buying tech from bitcoinstore.com, domains at name cheap, and a few other odds and ends that actually save me money.
Why to writers insist on namedropping silk road and duly publicizing drugs and tarnishing the image of bitcoin.
If the silk road changed over to the ironically named litecoin, it would help the image of bitcoin  right? I doubt that would ever be reported and publishers would just keep mud slinging on bitcoin anyway without doing any research.
And comparing linking their bank account to coinbase like linking a mutual fund also implies it's REALLY HARD, when in fact it's not at all.
This article is full of backhanded compliments if you ask me.
