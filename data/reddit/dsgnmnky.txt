Whoa, whoa, whoa...whoa...whoa...
One of us needs to settle the fuck down.

Why does my Blockchain app still work?

What difference does it make? Each of those people have huge followings. The more that people are comfortable with the term 'bitcoin' the better.

Hey man, got nothing to say. Just want to thank you for taking the time to write that email and actually getting a response! :)

This is big for bitcoin. Joe has a lot of influence in various fields.

Thank you for taking the time to write those emails and getting a confirmation for us. This is big!

Ah, ok. Goes to show my level of knowledge with these things.

I store my bitcoins with Blockchain which was recommended to me in this subreddit some time ago. Am I in any sort of risk?

The fact that this company only paid you after this post got on the front page makes me never want to be involved with this company ever. Sounds shady as fuck.

I still don't understand why coins need to be "mined".

Who is DPR?

I live in Los Angeles and I go to Subway all the time. I would gladly buy some sandwiches with bitcoins!

Hmm...so anyone can roll?
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:14:04
Um, I'm here for the gangba-I mean the gold?
Edit: Holy shit, thanks for the gold! This is the first time I've ever received any. Sah-weet!

Holy shit, I thoroughly enjoyed that. Very well done. It instantly took me back to middle school.
