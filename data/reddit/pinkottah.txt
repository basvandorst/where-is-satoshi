This literally already exists in hundreds of other forms of speculative markets. Old idea + block chain != new idea
Edit: Existing and past predictive markets

It's a kneejerk, uncreative, lowest common denominator type of analogy. It's an invention that runs on computers, so they jump to the first upstart application in recent memory, which does it a disservice by unnecessarily burdening it with it's own political baggage. 
Sharing a cd you ripped with people online is not even close to equivalent to what bitcoin is. I think with that analogy they're trying to portray Bitcoin as peer to peer Western Union or Paypal, and that is just wrong.

If you where a customer who had a positive balance at the time of the proceedings, your a creditor. However your probably lower on the list, to institutions that may have lent, or provided services to mtgox.

Exactly, dogecoin shouldn't be part of the conversation, let alone on @_date: 2014-04-24 13:52:09
It is by no means clear legally if MtGox is a forex, the law is being interpreted differently by multiple institutions. Until we have clarity from a legislative body, or a constitutional court, it's reasonable to argue otherwise.

No I don't want wall street in BTC
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:35:30
We need another entity to hold funds arbitrarily, have unhelpful customer service and to take a massive fee on most transactions. PayPal is perfect for that!

I do think the analogy is crap, Napster's use and intent was to share files, which where largely copying copyrighted works. Wrong or right, it was only a distribution mechanism for mostly already existing content. Bitcoin is a democratization of currency, in that anyone can make a unique unit with intrinsic value, independently. This is far more than anything napster did.  
Analogies are the personal computer (not the computer, but one you can own), or the printing press (in that it created mass literacy and de-reliance of the church, not as a copy mechanism).

No, its like I'm a PC, and I'm a colico vision.

I'm so tired of the dogecoin users posting this crap in other reddits. This stuff should be banned. It has nothing to do with bitcoin.

Any market system where short sells and corners are normal, is not something I want to be part of.

The obsessive worship of apple is infuriating. Especially when they where literally years behind their competitor in implementation, and not their invention in the first place.

This is not a situation likely relevant to home appliances.
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:21:02
How and when could my appliances trade resources with my neighbors? Networking only allows for the flow of information, and in general, except in extreme conditions my resource usage in my home cannot influence the availability of resources to my neighbors. Maybe its a failure of my imagination, but for consumer use I see this likely averaging to zero net benefit to the user. 
Now industrial, and transportation, theres real possabilities.

I think the idea of a regulating exchange is counter to the original philosophy of bitcoin. Decentralization is a step forward, regulation is a step backwards. A trustless peer to peer system makes it very hard for a single actor to manipulate the system, fairly or unfairly. With regulation we give away our individual control to that single actor.

So inflation has exceeded yields on capital investment. That's probably not a bad thing.

I don't like the idea of pandering to ignorance. Build, document, educate, no reasonable excuse not to. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:40:20
I think that's a misconception. People like to keep citing Apple as a great example, but they are not. They've gained market share, but they lost the PC market to their harder to use competitor, and they're losing mobile for the same reason. People moan, and complain that things are hard to use, yet they still use them. These people didn't know what a browser was, but I guarantee you they knew how to use one, and used one recently. We should not underestimate the consumer because they failed a pop vocabulary test, or because a few vocal individuals refuse to try. I also think we would be better as a culture if we embrased doing more thing that required us to educate ourselves.

That they can kill legal public use was the argument, not that they could kill all use. He even specifically stated a crack down would probably result  in a more resilient network.

No, but nether does growing hemp have anything to do with drug trade, but its still illegal in the US. Our laws don't make logical sense, and they are not applied evenly.

Because if you define a wallet as something that can generate limitless addresses, then the seed is less so wallet, as it does not even possess one address. The traditional paper wallet has at least one.

Its always so frustrating to see a great post, but have the top comment be some pedantic asshole correcting someone's grammar. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:11:24
No, its really not. For a very long time in US history it has been illegal, and still is at the federal level. My point is in no way invalidated by the legally ambiguous repeal of prohibition in a minority of states. Especially since my argument has absolutely nothing to do with pot and everything to do with irregular and confusing application of law in the US. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:00:37
So is having the private key on the paper wallet. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:16:48
Calling a seed backup a wallet makes even less sense using that criteria.
