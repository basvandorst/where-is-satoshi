if you're gonna clean dust out of a computer you generally take it outside first.
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:26:30
good point. what the fuck, OP?
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:30:20
half the credit goes to shitty autocorrect, the other half to a lack of people giving a shit about learning English theory.

Unpopular opinion: government cannot exist with "no taxes". That mean no police, no firemen, no sanitation, no roads, no running water. No thanks, I'm good.
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:22:05
bitcoin is so much less private than cash.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:56:44
is there an easy guide for those who don't know how?
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:49:12
freewallet.org uses segwit AND lets members trade with each other for free. i'm enjoying it.
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:26:46
I'm late to the party, is there a good link explaining the faketoshi debacle?
@_date: 2018-08-21 00:09:32
You joke, but I do lots of trades with my trust network on bitvest and occasionally stake. I've sold bitvest BTC for PayPal USD very happily. 
Emphasis on trust tho, I've had run ins with scammers too.

I'd be happy if it was stable, people could start using it as currency more
@_date: 2018-10-08 03:06:29
Yo dawg I heard you like shitposts so I made a shitpost about shitposts. Now you can be annoyed WHILE you're annoyed!
@_date: 2018-10-03 22:48:50
My hope is that continues tbh
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:56:56
it helps newbies who are looking at BCH propaganda/advertising and wondering if it's a good place to put their trust.

Reminds me of when I will the electronium sub. I asked what ETN does that sets it apart from other coins and the response was along the lines of "eat shit, troll". Total cult there, which is too bad because the ETN team is good at working with retailers for adoption!
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:56:14
you'd think that. but someone has to have the keys to the github.

You know that Lebowski meme? You're not wrong, you're just an asshole.

Bitcoin's carbon footprint might seem smaller when you compare the carbon produced by every country's money mint.

It wouldn't be too difficult to create a page that posts to Twitter and then control who uses that page.

Sounds like a libertarian viewpoint. Let me ask you this: how would your ideal government or market solve the problem of overfishing?
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:32:24


yeah i think this was the thing i read 
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:38:15
i remember reading that there was a strong theory that he was this one guy who died around that time... wish i'd kept the link

I love the Streisand Effect.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:39:33
Why not? ETN is pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:06:38
You guys, just do what he wants and call it Bitcoin Trash.
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:53:35
yup. if you're really desperate to just buy crypto and earn interest then invest on one of the more reputable casino sites, and even that you gotta do some research on.
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:40:35
Research the sunk cost fallacy and quit then
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:55:25
I feel like pricing would be hard too since the value changes so much sometimes.
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:24:57
Where I live if you lost less than $5k, the police just file it. It's the threshold for a major theft. A friend's nephew lost $4998 because the scammer knew that.

How much bandwidth does a node use? I remember doing the math over and being like "my ISP would kill me" but maybe I was off.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:37:59
That feels fraudy. You are selling product and claiming a loss when you have taken in crypto assets... I suppose you could balance it with Drawings (money the owner takes out of the company).
Not my business but be careful
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:13:08
This is good news for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-02 03:41:35
It's how scammers operate. They get you in for a little money and then you keep paying more thinking it might pay off eventually, trying to deny the truth of having been scammed. 
It sucks but you'll have to way the loss and move on :(
@_date: 2019-04-28 16:14:16
that's no worse than cash in the wallet though, and people are fine with the risk of their wallet being stolen.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:59:07
same here, IT helpdesk :D I'll PM it.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:58:44
Whoops, guess I can't post referral links here, my bad.
It's difficult, but I have a few. I waded through a LOT of garbage. If you want some links and a writeup, hit me up. I'm probably going to write a post on soon.
edit: they only allow direct links there. anyway, they have good ones there, and like i said, i have my list which i'll PM if you want.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:19:56
Work isn't as busy on Fridays for a lot of people so they can be buying BTC instead of working.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:51:59
Google translate did a good job on this one.
So... I'm only a month in to all of this. Can I... pretty much just ignore the S2X fork?
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:32:40
it's certainly what i was doing all day. i spend far more time on faucets than working some days.
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:23:27
is there an actual relation between them?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:42:04
has this happened before? does it tend to last long?
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:25:02
All I know about Hayek agrees. But that all comes from this:
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:56:56
i would argue that it's not terribly hard to use, and there's articles on how... but it does take a long time to set up and requires a little more understanding of what's going on under the hood. Once it's up and running though it's pretty easy. I even transferred my funds from Exodus using the importprivkey.
I did however have to research ways to throttle its bandwidth use, as I'm in Canada where the ISPs *really* don't like you using all your bandwidth.
@_date: 2019-09-24 05:10:50
Canadian here. She is the queen of England, and also the queen of Canada. She still technically controls our laws through the governor general (but will never exercise that power). We didn't even patriate our constitution until 1982. We're proud to be part of the Commonwealth, for the most part. I know i am.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:36:57
This is the explanation I needed, thanks :)
I'd love to have my coins now, but hey, as long as it's something explainable and not just me having bad luck, I'm cool.
