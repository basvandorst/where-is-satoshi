I posted this on I wasn't surprised when they deleted my post, but they didn't even bother to rebut my argument. And so I thought I would post it here for the benefit of the ever-growing bitcoin community. Go get yourself a Trezor or a Ledger or something else!
**Compared to its competitors, KeepKey might as well have been abandoned**
I originally bought two of these at the end of 2016 for $99 each. At the time, I thought it was a five-star product—I really loved its usability and security model. But over the course of a year, while KeepKey's competitors have added support for several altcoins, KeepKey had added only a few. Instead, KeepKey released a gold-plated *bling* version. Seriously.
It seems the folks who run this company must have gotten rich off of bitcoin and don't care much about their business anymore. Yesterday, I ordered a two-pack of the Ledger Nano S. Maybe I'll wipe my KeepKeys and try to resell them, or maybe I'll just save them as collectors items (j/k). In any case, anyone reading this should know a KeepKey wasn't worth $99, and definitely isn't worth $129. Check out Trezor and Ledger hard wallets. These guys are done.

Do you read the news? The government warned the exchanges and traders yesterday. Clearly, bitcoin, its price volatility, and the potential for Chinese citizens to move their cash abroad (or, conversely, to gamble their life savings) is of considerable concern to the government.
China is nothing if not an army of bureaucrats, and it would take but one of them to "manage" bitcoin. It doesn't matter whether the PBOC, the PLA, the exchanges, or anyone else actually does it. The point is that they could have it done because it would be easily controllable, and a crash would be against the government's interests. The longer the price remains so stable, the more likely the price is already being managed.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:39:50

Also importantly, it is a warning. If, in the future, the government perceives that they aren't self-regulating, there will be problems. The Chinese government does this kind of thing all the time. 
If Chinese exchanges heed the call, I'd expect the government to stay at arm's length. They may work with officials behind the scenes to make sure expectations are understood and met.

You're right—it was hyperbole.
There is a difference between losing a large percentage, as is possible with many securities, and losing everything, which is likely when I gamble at a casino: If I get $200 in chips, I know that's what I'm "spending" on the evening's entertainment, because odds are I'm not going to have anything left to cash in at the end of the night. Investing in bitcoin may actually be more like the former, but it *feels* more like the latter.
@_date: 2017-01-07 20:52:01
I'm starting to wonder if the government hasn't now bought enough to control the price (target of $888, of course). The few billion it would take to easily control the price is chump change to them.
With enough capital, a 12 year old could buy and sell enough to manage the price of bitcoin.
Though it should be noted the Chinese government has been powerless to manage their (much larger) stock markets as they'd like.

I'm interested in holding for the *very* longterm, but yeah, if I think I can dodge a collapse in price to preserve my gains along the way, I'll try. But with bitcoin's relative volatility, you have to watch closely, and I'm going to get tired of that. Plus, I keeps me treasure on a hard wallet, so it takes some reaching and stretching and plugging-in to get trading.
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:22:54

Well, it is what bubbles do.
But if you're in it for the long haul, you avoid the bursts if you can, ready to get back in, knowing the train will keep on going. But it's much easier (and usually wiser) to just bite the bullet and hold on. 
And I don't know about everyone else, but as someone who has watched Chinese markets (and the Chinese government intervene), I can say it's something bitcoin investors will want to be aware of.

The idea is to diversify. Going all-in on any single investment is—without a doubt—the fastest way to lose all your money.

FWIW, my research showed Coinbase to be one of the least shady (thus the accompanying anal probe). It's one of the best funded and  most scrutinized by its investors. (Or so I've read.)
I definitely wouldn't use it if I were doing anything shady, but it seems a good place for simple purchases and selling. Once you have a Coinbase account, you can use their GDAX.com exchange, which is better for long-term investing, but not really ready for short-term trading.

Without debt, you can't build a credit history. And without a credit history you can't buy anything "big" with credit/mortgage: car, house, etc.
At least in the US, you *need* some debt. But yes, you need to pay it off according to schedule or faster if you can.
But yes, living beyond your means on credit is very, very dumb.
**And owing a lot of debt is the opposite of being free.** In this sense many Americans (and others) aren't nearly as free as they think they are.

Regardless who creates it, a BTC ETF would be like a coming out party for bitcoin. It would garner big publicity, give bitcoin a brighter sheen of legitimacy, and it would bring bitcoin to everyday investors who wouldn't touch an exchange site with a 10-foot pole—but who would buy a few hundred shares of a US-listed ETF at the recommendation of a friend or financial advisor. 
It would be a big deal.
@_date: 2016-12-27 14:38:07
As an investor (and hopefully user) new to BTC, I have to say, this feels more like a casino game than investing. I'm emotionally prepared for my stack of chips to go up in a puff of smoke, but it's very entertaining in the meantime.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:21:22
Uh, yeah. That should go without saying. But I'll maintain that ignoring the consensus of what is "reality" is a generally unhelpful practice.
Edit: Bloomberg's US stream just had a 5 minute discussion of bitcoin's rise in 2016 and it's future. Other than pointing out the PI's noises about regulation as a risk (which I see as a good thing—the government has no intention of making it harder for the PI diaspora to send money home), it was a glowingly bright assessment (if a little softball, to be honest).

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I bought in at $850. I had only started researching about a week and a half before. I think I made the decision to buy around $800. And, a little over-paranoid, I waited until I had my hardware wallets in hand before making my first purchase, by which time it had risen another $50. 
That rise through November into December was inspiring.
@_date: 2016-12-28 03:14:56
I was just thinking that if word has spread enough that the everyday Chinese individual "investor" (a broad term to include investors, gamblers, and the types to fall prey to pyramid schemes) is jumping in, this could get very weird.

I'd like to say that as an outside holder of bitcoin, I do want what's best for bitcoin, but I don't know enough to know what's best for it.  (Edit: And since you all can't reach consensus, I'm not going to spend the next several years to try to figure it out for myself.)
But I can tell you that as an adult, people who act like this and publicly support failure of "the other side" due to a coordinated attack, are not doing anything to support your own cause.
Again, I'm intellectually neutral in this debate, but immature cheerleaders (on both sides, but especially on the Core side) are really just turning away the serious and educated people you really should be trying to win over. Those of us over  the age of 40 are far less susceptible to "clever" memes.
It's obvious some of you all have skin (i.e., your own livelihoods) in the game, but showing undecideds that you'll do anything to stop BU by celebrating attacks is really beyond the pale.
If you think it through, you might actually want to stop doing that kind of thing.

I've got no problem with truth or criticism. My problem is racist caricature, of which that image was undeniably an example.
You may be unaware of this, but it's designed to inspire fear and hate of "Red China," something to which many "fools" are susceptible. Of course that kind of thing discredits its user to those of us who aren't fools.
But you are either unaware of this, or okay with it. Either way, I'm unimpressed.

If he has it in a Roth IRA, he's smarter than you. If not, you're probably right.

Curiously, it's also one of the few legal ways (for Americans) to earn tax-free investment income tied to bitcoin (in a Roth IRA).

That's incorrect. With a normal brokerage account, you pay higher short-term capital-gains tax if you hold for less than 365 days. If you hold it for a year or more, you pay lower long-term capital-gains tax. 
You're right that with a Roth IRA, there are no capital gains tax.

Define "horrible." At the moment, it's up more than 400% YTD.
I could totally be wrong, but I'm guessing you either have a thing against Barry Silbert or you don't have a Roth IRA set up for yourself.

I hear it's in the Japanese media even more than it is in the US, so I guess it depends how much people are paying attention.

FYI, it's essentially illegal to be openly gay in Russia and several countries in the sphere of Russian influence. Or, as Putin says, "there are no gays in Russia."
Also, Russia just decriminalized domestic abuse earlier this year. Russian men can beat their wife and kids, knowing they'll only have to pay a fine.
You seem to imply otherwise, as if the UAE's autocracy is any worse than Putin's autocracy. That doesn't fly with those of us who aren't uneducated idiots.

So much froth. $3000 was delirium. Settling *around* $2000 for a few months before marching onward/upward would be nice. The next big rally would only attract many more investors, continuing the *eventual* (&lt;edit) push past critical mass with regard to "Gold 2.0" status.
Suckers gotta learn to hold on if they're ever going to overcome buy-high/sell-low. The media are always only going to report the "crashes."

Well, competitors have launched better products (e.g. KeepKey) using their software *because* it's open source, so it makes sense from a business perspective. If you can tolerate people supporting themselves and even growing the enterprises that allow them to sell the goods you want to buy, then you probably shouldn't mind a change like this too much.
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:13:33
I preferred my KeepKey until I saw that.
