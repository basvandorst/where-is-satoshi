No, but I am commenting to be part of it just in case...

Very possible. But if it trebles in value before crashing by 50% that's still fine by me. And unless there is an existential threat or integral problem with bitcoin, it'll recover at least to some extent after such a crash.

I can't think of any countries that have no socialist aspects including US and North Korea. There are huge variations in between and using blanket terms incorrectly makes any discussion meaningless

No Scandinavian countries are socialist.

Why would that correct shortly?
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:50:55
I don't think that seems likely. People dumping their BCH are buying BTC with it. The spike we're seeing at the moment might crash a little, but I wouldn't count on it.

This is what is killing BTC

You made the straw man by inventing that I had said bitcoin is 'different than every type of investment vehicle' when all I said is that the ridiculous analogy of tulip mania does not apply. I was thus not making a straw man in return but attacking the position you had plucked out of thin air and ascribed to me.


Don't patronize me by 'simplifying' it by actually giving your very first argument (which I appreciate and have been waiting a long time for). If you can't hold a grown-up conversation why bother interacting with other people in the first place?
As to the actual substance of your argument, I agree there is a lot of speculation and as a result it is very volatile, meaning ups and downs. It does have significant value as a currency as it has already shown in countries with significant inflation, but I do not believe it will ever replace or significantly compete with fiat. Its potential as such will only become fully realized once the speculation slows and when that happens there will be some significant drops, but I do not believe we are anywhere near that level yet, and I believe it will stabilize to something quite reasonable. It is overall far more akin to the gold rush than tulip mania, except it is known exactly how much there is and will ever be. 
I will very happily talk again in a year.

What? No it isn't, how am I saying it is different from every other investment vehicle? Not all investments are bubbles or the world's economy would just not be a thing... You do know what a bubble is? 
You are yet to give a single argument as to why bitcoin is a bubble, let alone one that can be compared to the tulip debacle. And yes, comparing it to tulips is ridiculous because not only was the whole historical thing hugely exaggerated to sell books, tulips are also fundamentally so insanely and obviously different to bitcoin.

Nah, more like the other way around. To become one of the richest people you have to be obsessed. But if one just gave you their fortune that wouldn't mean you would become obsessive about it in turn.

Sure, but we are in uncharted territories so there is no knowing what is "probable", the doomsayers and hodlers alike are merely making their own fallible predictions.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:00:06
Such as? Nothing comparable to Bitcoin I am sure...
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:45:24
Oh God, not tulips. This is the most tired and debunked false analogy, please tell me there is more to your argument than that? I mean it isn't really an argument, just "I think BTC is a bubble, this thing which was different in every way imaginable was a bubble, therefore BTC is a bubble." And maybe it is, but you need to give reasonable arguments to persuade anyone.
