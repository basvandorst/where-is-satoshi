The most u can get? 18k? If he says no then go for a little over 16? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:23:14

Yes, but bitcoin is the most widely adopted coin and the coin with the most following. So if it continues the trend as the cryptocurrency king, it being capped at 21 million means it's extremely safe to buy now 
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:22:44
Yeah and the fact that only 21 million can be made and once it becomes a widespread use 4.5k is gonna be the cheapest you've ever seen it 
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:17:57
lol Id take u up on that potentially, how much per mill? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:23:27
Basically, bitcoin &gt; USD/EURO ($$$) 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:33:32
Lmao the dude was arrested and anything dealing with his arrest (profit/bitcoin) is legally allowed to be seized. Similar to how the FBI is allowed to seize all assets gained from drug dealing or anything else illegal bitcoin is no different

No, the major dump already happened which only lasted like 12 hours or something. It's been pretty steady at 2600 and for better or for worse I don't think it's gonna be moving way too much in either direction for a lil

@_date: 2017-06-07 01:48:46

@_date: 2017-06-10 01:10:44

@_date: 2017-06-14 09:42:27
