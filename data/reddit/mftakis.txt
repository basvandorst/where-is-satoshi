Yeah iota isn’t perfect but from my understanding it is open source and eventually smart phones will be able to process the transactions. But that’s besides the point. I just don’t understand the appeal of bitcoin at this point? Can someone who is invested in it explain their reasoning and how they see it being implemented in the future?

I just wanted to start a dialogue. If something is going become widely used it needs to out perform the current system. Something that takes a while to process and has high fees is going to be a tough sell to the average person. Especially if they are presented with an option that can do the exact same thing without all the issues. I have no idea which one will replace it as I’m no expert, but from what I’ve learned about Cryptos in the last month is that bitcoin isn’t the best, it’s just the first

Thank you for that well thought out response. I can see why someone would place their bet on bitcoin. Dependability goes a long way especially with peoples money. 
Not sure if I am at this point but it makes more sense to me why someone would

Yes but not all coins use block chain. Iota is an interesting one that has no fees and infinite scalability. People investing in bitcoin at this point are a little late to the party

I am going to stop addressing other cryptos because it’s the wrong thread for that but there are other ways to have a secure transaction. None as proven as bitcoin I will admit

Sorry I tried to steer away from it earlier and bring it back to bitcoin but it kind of picked up. I’ll avoid naming any certain names in the future.  first post on reddit, still learning how things work

Are people who invested in bitcoin at all concerned about the fact it has large fees and zero scalability? The flow of money to alt coins is due to some of them having better technology behind it that will work long term. Has this been considered?
