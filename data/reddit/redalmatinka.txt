It was a joke, but if you want an answer: 
a.) because he's a control freak megalomaniac 
b.) to fuck with his sworn enemies the Winklevoss twins, they claim to own 1% of BTCs

Keep in mind there are no bitcoins per se, only bitcoin addresses. It's not possible to taint individual coins only the addresses that received a transaction from a tainted address.
If I steal 1000 BTCs and put it on my address, that address will be tainted. But since **I can move BTC to anyone's address** not just mine, I can taint your address as well so all the funds contained in your address will become tainted.

Where is the proof?

Using a product like this won't make you any safer because instead of the government now you have to trust a random stranger on the internet who promises not to spy on you or steal all your coins while they can do that.
It's a likely honeypot targeted at bitcoin users (advertised at r/bitcoin) who dumb enough to pay 40$ for 5 mins of work (installing a free software following step by step instructions). 
So they make an easy target, known to hold values (bitcoins) that can be stolen without a trace.

I like your explanation.
Bear in mind that the owner of a "Grow shop" in Hungary was sentenced to 1 year (probation) because in the Judge's words: "most of the products sold by the shop can be used to grow marijuana".
If a country can make Bitcoin illegal it's Hungary.
Zuckerberg might be there to learn how to do it.
