Sure, that's one arbitrary definition of rich.
Imagine you're part of a household that brings in 250k annually.  You have a house with equity and some investments, taken collectively equaling 500k.  Are these people "rich?"  If you say "no" then the number of rich people in the US is an extremely small percentage of the total population.  That doesn't mean you're wrong, but I don't think you're using the same arbitrary definition as *most* people use.

Even excluding the 3rd world, yes.
It just isn't "become president despite being actually retarded" rich.

Same for me, if not slightly worse.  Where I live there are also people that shit on the street in broad daylight.  To them, rich would be living in doors.
To most Americans owning a home and saving 50k a year would be well into the realm of "rich."

Well, I guess we're dividing things differently.  As an upper-middle class person I can buy a new car without sacrificing standard of living, pay my rent without issue, buy the toys that I want, and despite living in the bay area, probably put a mortgage on a house in the next 5 years.
For the middle class and below none of that is necessarily true.  I would argue that white collar Americans live a reality much closer to that of the upper class than the lower class, in actual terms.  The upper middle class also makes up a smaller and smaller portion of Americans.
You can divide it either way, but does the software dev with a Golf R have more in common with the CEO with a Gulfstream or the McDonald's worker that can't afford rent?  To *most* people the dev is "rich," albeit the software dev probably doesn't think so him/herself.

The answer is, they don't know shit.
Bitcoin is an infant.  It might do anything.  I personally believe it will rebound, but that's almost just fancy.  It might tank.
This is not investing in a company.   This is speculating on greed.  Don't get in over your head and things will be fine.  If you are in over your head, figure out when you *must* bail out.  If you can afford to gamble, wait for the rebound.  It will probably come, but it isn't certain that it will.

If it hits 10,500, sell.  Don't Hodl.  Don't be a true believer.  A loan is not your money to gamble.  You can be a true believer when you have the extra assets to do so.
My guess is it *won't* hit 10,500, and the upswing is on it's way, but set a boundary for yourself.  Drinking the koolaid is all fun and games when you can afford to lose, but let me be perfectly clear on this point: in order for a lot of people to win, a lot of people need to lose.  A lot of people are going to take a hit, because that's how speculation works.  It wouldn't work otherwise.  If this was part of your trust fund and you were in it for the lelz, maybe ride it into the ground.  But a loan isn't a slush fund, it's an obligation.
Make sure you sell at 10,500.  It isn't going to happen, so don't worry about it, but if it does (because I, and any of the rest of the people here could be wrong,) make sure you cash out and pay off that loan.  There will be other waves to ride, and FOMO is your animal brain telling you that tomorrow doesn't exist.  Tomorrow exists.  Don't fuck tomorrow you.
And when it's back at 17,000 in two weeks, have a good laugh about all the pants shitting you did this week. ;)
