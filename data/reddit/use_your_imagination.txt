This will make people more aware of security and privacy when using internet. I see everywhere tech people screaming User Experience and Simple Services ... Right, this made the majority of internet users stupid not caring about privacy and security. If an extortion program can get into your computer, any other program can get inside.

Sure ... like p2p has been stopped from mainstream, a majority of people from young generations know how to use p2p already ... 
Here's an other way to see it. Think of Bitcoin as an Ideology, you can punish or ban people from using it but it's still there and people can use it as long as the internet exists. Furthermore, the more your forbid something the more resilient and and attractive it becomes to people.

Which is what's wrong with the banking system, you can easily become a collateral damage, "a part of the statistics". I understand their move was under panic, but it shows how the system has big flaws for individual financial liberties.

Your arguments makes sens if all governments in the world had the same incentives and were all alike. Which is far from the reality. In reality the fiat currency created a monopoly and a huge imbalance in economy which is backed by nothing but ridiculous amounts of debt. The BRICS is one example of the political war going on about who controls the currencies ... which in the end is history repeating itself. 
Bitcoin and generally crypto-currencies offer a solution to this problem. And ironically, it is more difficult to control in countries with abusive governments. I come from a country ruled by corruption and restrictive financial laws, people simply do everything in cash and the majority of businesses don't pay taxes. If they knew about bitcoin they would all jump into it. 
This decentralized feature of Bitcoin makes it extremely difficult to stop or restrict on every edge, it's like trying to stop water from spreading with your hands. 
It's an exciting experiment that might break several times, until it's widespread adoption as a new free market economy. 
Yes governments might want to stop it, some of them could in someway succeed at it, but since Bitcoin doesn't need state and authority to work, it doesn't matter how hard they try, they can't stop it everywhere.
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:57:58
It's amazing for me that many arguments seem to not understand that point. I always felt confused when I read the "longest chain" argument from BU people. It seemed cristal clear to me what longest chain meant when I first read Satish paper. I guess not everyone is able to understand what they read.
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:05:09
I would go further and say Satoshi with the technical and Andreas with the educational/ethical are the biggest influencers of crypto-currencies. 
I heard many times  Andreas say "If you understand Bitcoin, you should not listen to me, make your own decision". Even though this is true for a few minority of us who understand the technology, it is not the case for non technical people new to bitcoin or not interested in the technology. They will naturally listen and agree to what makes sense to them and makes them feel safe. Andreas is fulfilling this role and I feel he already succeeded in his mission even if he personally doesn't seem to believe he did.
Sometimes when I think about all the attacks that will face Bitcoin, I remember people like Andreas exist, they are maybe not the loudest but there are many who believe, understand and sacrifice as much for Bitcoin. This thought alone makes me realize nothing will kill Bitcoin. It's naturally Anti-Fragile.  
Of course let's not forget the developers/miners/users/businesses/youtubers ... we all have an impact.

Basically, this bullshit reply is just a last minute fix by their PR guys.

@_date: 2016-11-03 18:52:37
I don't know for you but I think this is great news. We're finally reaching  "They fight you" step. Bitcoin (as envisioned by Satoshi) is inevitably destined to face governments trying to control it. When they realize it's not possible it will simply become direct attacks: firewalls, bans, fighting exchanges .. etc.
The only thing I'm wondering is, would there be a single government that would officially embrace Bitcoin ? Is this even possible ? It would mean no more central banks and monetary policy. A government would have exactly the same freedom and power over money as any citizen. 
Interesting times to come :)

It is only scary for those who see the price. Price is pushing adoption, if it tanks, a new wave of users would have discovered what is bitcoin. Many or maybe even majority for speculation, but with time when they will see how fucked is the current economic system they already know the exit. 
So the way i think about it, whatever brings users is good. Call what you want: bubble, fomo, speculation, greed, it's all good.  Many people don't understand that is the real trojan horse of bitcoin in the current fiat system

As any new technology, you need to make an effort to educate yourself and accept the risk. No one knew the internet would become what it is today. If you're in it just for the quick buck, go gamble your money in a casino it will be more "fun". If you feel interested by this technology or it's potential, read the paper, understand  how money works and make educated decisions by yourself.

Unfortunately no one has a say in this. No one can control when and how it will become mainstream. It has to adapt AND survive every unique threat, even of it's own success. That is why only a decentralized p2p system can do it.

To be honest if that ever happens i would personally just blacklist all subnets from the cloud, how many are there ? Dozen at max ? 
We could setup a list of cloud subnets and just ignore all of them.  For anyone who wants a node just run it on a reall machine or affoard a server.

I hear you. But I don't think it's ever gonna be or feel "stable". Contrary to all technology built on the internet which was always relying on a form of central authority, Bitcoin is the first trustless decentralized technology that seems to work. The trustless part comes at the cost of having enemies from every front, after all it's trying to change the way we perceive and use money since it was first invented. It's gonna be non stop struggle and fight even when you think it became mainstream. My way to see it is, we need to get used to it and ignore it as noise, the same way we got used to the noise of cars in the cities as background noise, and even though it's annoying as hell, it didn't stop mainstream adoption because the benefits outweigh the rest.
Edit: by the way the internet itself is not stable but we can agree it achieved mainstream adoption. The reason is it reached a critical mass that makes the constant change invisible to us. Andreas used the boat analogy, we're now on a small boat, we can feel the waves (change, innovation). Once the boat becomes a big ship ( critical mass ) you will not feel the waves, it doesn't mean the waves disappeared.

The more tightening of KYC rules they do, the more crypto will spread like trying to hold water. People naturally hide and protect their wealth when they feel someone is trying to control it. More so for foreign immigrants who use remittance or workers from unbanked or "sanctioned" countries ...

The hardware wallet holds your key that authorizes anyone who holds it and knows its password to use the funds protected by it. 
Your coins themselves are locked in the blockchain running on the internet. Everyone can see they are there but no one can use them without the key. 
When you want to spend them, you use your key (hardware wallet) to authorize (sign a transaction) the transfer of your coins which are on the blockchain. The authorization happens inside your hardware wallet, you don't need to access blockchain for this. 
Once it's authorized (like you signed a check) , you  send it to the network which then recognizes you're the owner and you are allowing this transaction.
Your wallet is the one downloading the blockchain, if it's locally like bitcoin core, it needs the full blockchain.  
If it's Trezor through the web wallet, they keep a copy of the blockchain for you and handle "sending" your signed transaction for you.

Money is a store of value, not a currency. 


It's value comes from the proof-of-work algorithm and the energy/technology required to maintain the block of chain which is the closest thing to an intrinsic value. 
Also, the intrinsic value of any money is subjective. We value gold because it's shiny, scarse and have some use in the industry, but we value it mostly because it has been in the past used as a symbol of wealth and power. So it all depends on how you define an intrinsic value. 


This can't be possible until the bitcoin becomes a full-loop system, which means every thing from production to consumer is estimated in bitcoin. This volatility and exponential growth is natural for a new monetary system which aims to replace the current broken fiat currency system. We are not just observing the value of Bitcoin grow, we are also observing the fiat currencies inflate :)

Bitcoin is in it's infancy, give it some time, remember facebook started in 2004 and got  mainstream only in 2009/2010. Bitcoin is a much more complex thing than facebook, twitter, and even the internet. It's volatile because it's not mature yet. 
There are many people who hold many coins and are welling to spend them, I myself already used bitcoin to buy services and as a freelance programmer am accepting bitcoin for projects. All the hard work is still to be done, educating people to learn about bitcoin and what's wrong with our current economy

This was and old article that was updated today with a statement delivered by the Bank Of France. 
[The official statement](
Here's is a brief summary of the article, I will try to analyse the official document and give an update later:
"The Bank Of France warns about the dangers of Bitcoin. It states that even if crypto-currencies do not fall under the jurisdiction of payment regulation authorities, the central bank is closely looking into bitcoin.
Given its highly volatile attributes, it's considered as a major risk for its owners. Bank Of France warns that no authority can guarantee the safety of the digital safes used to store this currency, making its users at risk of being hacked.
Furthermore, in order for bitcoin to be considered as a legal currency, it must play by the rules of approved payment systems. Therefore, any platform handling those operations must obtain the required status and follow the rules delivered by the right authorities, and thus, comply to anti-laundering rules. Bank Of France must therefore oversee and approve the security of the plateforms dealing with bitcoin.
However, further use of bitcoin to purchase good and services, including criminal activities, could be out of control In that case, the involvement of the police force would be necessary to stop these criminal activities "

Yes, the more people learn and educate themselves about it the more they will understand how important it is to promote it instead of fighting against it. I think it's just a matter of time, bitcoin is going mainstream faster than we thought.

You just need to pay more fees if you want the transaction to be quicker. Also the race for mining that is coming will balance the growth in transaction volumes

It's just the translation of the article's title, which is one of the most read papers in France. I think it's important that we stay aware of how and what the media says. It's not about upvotes, given the tone of the article and the content of the document from Bank Of France we can see how this will badly influence French people who want to know about Bitcoin. 
Also, any official statement from the French government should be carefully considered. It actually could have huge impacts on other countries, France had many colonies and countries (Africa and Caribbean) who will just wait for France to lead the way on crypto-currencies regulations.

I think we might be experiencing one of the biggest opportunities of transfer of power and economic dominance in the history of modern society. As I always say to skeptical people about bitcoin, even if it does not succeed as a currency, the technology behind it and the awareness it had put onto governments and people will change our society in a dramatic way. 
I only hope it doesn't end in civil wars and blood.

I haven't touched cpp in 4 years but the recent developement of bitcoin and possible threats to it convinced to get back on cpp. As a true believer in bitcoin for freedom of economy, I commit my sword of programming to protect bitcoin and it's community.
