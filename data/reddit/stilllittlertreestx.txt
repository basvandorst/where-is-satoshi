Seems unintentional but worth the call out to fix future reposts. Sorry yall, point seems correct but handled like a dick (me)!

I posted the evidence. If someone is making money of kids and BTC ignorance, you both did your part driving me to dig in.
Many thanks, free up-votes gentlemen.

Did you QR both of them, the new one had a address while the original could not be read. Only tested one client so I'm quick to backtrack and apologize if I'm wrong. 
OP seems to not think so, a second opinion welcomed.

YOU'RE A PHONY OP. Please do not scam children. 
Guys, credit to zomgitsduke but I did the homework. Shameful elgold would scam children. 
- Please reference the original image post. Nice quality huh?

Credit to IamtheSlothKing for posting the link and starting this hunt!
- This is OPs quality:

Analyzing the QR codes [nice freeware for that used [here]( there magically appears a readable QR in the repost. 
QR analyzer results and source files mentioned above all uploaded [here](
**Bonus points** After dug into that BTC address and remain confident in my assumption, but it is just that unless OP says otherwise. The cost of lemonade was 0.000023 but wallet in question has never received that amount. 
**Tl;dr** The original post was locked and this image was used maliciously for financial gain by modifying the BTC wallet address. 
Shameless plug, and all crypto: Bitcoin is the start of something new and great, but wallets and granular use will remain filled with it's own bad guys. 
You wouldn't close your eyes and hand a cash payment to someone. Please, to help the ecosystem and culture, always check your wallet address and send cautiously. PM op to donate, but from the looks of it this scam has caught no one yet :D 
My background: Ran a mid scale mining operation of about four algorithms and worked as a PM for over eight years. Also, cyber forensics and counter-cyber terrorism cert but never use it.

I apologize for the name calling, but the circumstances look sketch. I'll remove it.

You bring a valid point. There was a digital currency before that led to BTC, the market growth lacks checks and balances (wild west with 0days lol). Many new protocols in the day that blazed the path eventually go the way of Netscape, some should burn in hell like Bitconnect, but see earlier point.
Good input. IMO
