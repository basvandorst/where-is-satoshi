Happened to me. $500 camera lens. Paypal just said sorry over the phone. "Nothing we can do", even though the guy SIGNED FOR THE PACKAGE.

I think the big question missing from this discussion so far is, how do you drive traffic?
Do you rely mainly on SEO? Word of mouth/online forum mentions? Paid advertising? My company is going to start accepting bitcoin in the next week and I'd love to hear about the payment method opening up a new source of customers.
Congratulations, by the way. That's an awesome story to hear.

Compared to black people, who have literally never invented or understood a new technology. 
Seems legit.

I was thinking of this very issue today. When we reach the 21 millionth coin (or even the 19th or 20th million, when mining is hugely de-incentivized due to the difficulty), what will encourage miners to keep their systems online to process transactions, especially while the use of bitcoins (theoretically) grows? As more transactions take place, more processing power is needed, yet less processing is encouraged.
Somebody help me understand.

Wow that's quite the accident. It looks like you hit the very peak.

Expansion of government for the "good and safety" of the people usually (always) ends up doing the exact opposite.

This is inherently a problem with our governments' size. If govt. didn't have the power to affect such changes, would it be worth lobbying to?

Yeah I'm really wondering if the creator thought of this. How do you encourage the mining network to keep processing transactions near/at the end of the bitcoin creation cycle?

America needs to repeal at least half of our bullshit laws that are currently on the books. It's ludicrous that we still call ourselves a 'free' country with such a maze of legal bullshit.
