Nice work!

Dont sell your bitcoin. Make sure you get a safe wallet, id suggest jaxx or mycellium and get your btc off the exchange. If you accumulate alot of btc (anything over 1.0 is alot imo), look into hardware wallets or print off your btc and keep it in a safe or vault. Thats what I do, I accumulate up to 1btc on my phone wallet then print it off (offline with Armory) and boom its done. Also keep that seed password safe!!

You shouldnt be spending your btc. Hodl that shit mate!
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:19:58
You can either print paper copies of wallets (create them offline) or simply order yourself a harware wallet like the trezor or ledger. They are like 99$ and are well worth it. Good luck. Buy and buy again. Always hodl and thank the gods in 5 years

@_date: 2017-03-06 18:45:09

@_date: 2017-03-26 03:16:32

@_date: 2017-03-19 22:16:44
This is the worse advice i've seen in a long time
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:17:20
Jaimerais tellement ca pouvoir y aller mais je suis dans le nord de l alberta. Je suis content de voir que tu essayes de regrouper les gens ensemble. Bonne chance! 
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:02:33
Thanks for response, i am looking i to running a node on my laptop and signaling for segwit. This makes no sense, such high fees make it almost impossible to promote bitcoin lol :(
@_date: 2017-01-07 01:59:52
Hopefully we will not all have that same fate in regards to bitcoin. It hurts me everytime i look at the price ticker. Its all part of the process i guess
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:11:31
Hold and enjoy the ride
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:07:35
How soon is the question
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:15:52
HODL the btc, explain she might have a really nice house before she knows it because of btc
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:32:05
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:26:58
Its crazy how long it takes before people to get with the new info. Really not hard to go on bitcoinwisdom.com and see its almost 50-50 with the united states now since fees were implemented.
@_date: 2017-01-15 17:43:51
Cconfirmations come with time. You can go to your transaction tab on mycelium and see how many confirmation you have for said transaction. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:01:37
Its coming!!!!
@_date: 2017-01-13 00:15:44
Now please hodl and enjoy the ride
@_date: 2017-01-18 22:11:31
Will it be available in canada?
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:54:33
Yup its gonna be quite the ride
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:45:01
I just noticed this as well. Wanted to place some indicators on btc cny chart off bitcoinwisdom. They seem to have removed them from the database???
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:05:29
Im watching it now and usa has 10x the amount of btc bought than china
@_date: 2017-01-20 03:44:55
Sorry to hear that. I love quadrigacx and have used them for all my purchases. I hope it gets sorted out for you. I am a canadian in canada with canadian bank account so maybe thats why it went smoother for me.
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:50:45
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:50:31
Thabk you
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:51:12

@_date: 2017-01-10 23:43:41
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:06:03
Even russia is seeing more volume than china
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:42:14
Just go small. Thats what i did. Just shapeshifted 0.1btc into ltc with jaxx wallet. Easy mode! 
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:57:20

@_date: 2017-01-07 00:51:37
Thanks and i will try not too!
@_date: 2017-01-21 22:33:08
Soon with Abra we will not have this problem. Local Abra tellers FTW
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:44:40

@_date: 2017-01-26 22:55:27

See my comment! You just have to wait it out dude. Go to your transaction tab on mycelium and you will see how many confirmations your are at
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:50:21
I bought on three different occasions. I would put 400$ canadian every pay for the last month and a bit
@_date: 2017-01-21 20:07:25
Im excited for this and have signed up to be a teller up in northern canada. I reckon it will be a great way to male a few extra bitcoins while helping people xfer money.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:12:03
Ok so the blocks will take longer to mine if I understand correctly? This will probably increase the price as well correct?
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:44:41
Dont day trade BTC!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hold the coins for minimum 2 years imo
