Afaik, it is and it's because it takes specialized equipment. Seems like bitcoin would be much much better off if electricity cost of mining was within a factor of 2 for specialized computer vs a modern desktop computer.

Nope. Nat also provides privacy: you could be any one of many people behind the nat. You don't get that with ipv6 and a firewall.

Sounds good, except for this part: "the timechain’s currency (Time.)" I assume the currency is actually just a number like bitcoin. Calling it "Time", is completely absurd from a usability standpoint. It would be like introducing bitcoin and saying the currency is called "distance." I sent you 5 distance. Huh? Are you crazy? Oh, and no explanation whatsoever. So, a big wtf just sitting there unexplained.

Dollars. I usually buy a few hundred worth from time to time.

Oddly, the circle price was not 1% higher than random first hits on google this time when I went to buy. Perhaps something has changed. Thanks for all the replies. I'm much better informed.

I did not suggest early adopters shouldn't benefit.

Buyers WANT protections. Of course, but protections don't come for free. Sometimes you'd rather not have protections, like cash.

has a 4 sentance summary of bitcoin. I'm saying several of its major assertions are completely wrong. I'm not "correcting small errors" or paying attention to "minor details."

100 upvotes of nonsense for every 1 vote of common sense... what does that say about bitcoin's relation to trust, speculation, corruption, etc? Nothing good.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:11:31
Exactly. 


Who cares!? This has nothing to do with the protocol!

Followers give authority. If I make up religion x, and 100000 follow what I say about relegion x, I have authority within religion x.

Thanks for the good post. I feel that the usefulness of low fee and irreversable transactions are bound to make a crypto-currency have an important place in society, and bitcoin is leading simply because 1. it was the first 2. speculation 3. network effects. But the devs, especially satoshi also made hugely important decisions about financial policies, but bitcoin boosters seems to have their head in the sand about this. This is certainly a good reason for the media to seek out satoshi.

The IT infrastructure is decentralized. I was thinking most about the authority/power. So, I was wrong.

By distribute, I mean the initial distribution, aka the issue of currency. Edited for clarification.

Long term we are both dead so nothing matters. In long term that actually matters, the sum of crypto can grow by something ridiculous like 1000x, because most of money is in fiat not crypto, which means it is not zero sum. Zero sum crypto would mean any growth in bitcoin would mean an equal loss for other coins, that is clearly not the case.

tinypic.com won't show your image without javascript, and it's an ad riddled pos. Try another site.

Try reddit's own image hosting. If you submit on desktop, you can upload an image in the initial submit form. If not that, then imgur.com

It doesn't work that way. They only know if data is "tethered" data, by running proprietary crapware on your phone which reports back to them if data is tethered, but you can buy 100 different model phones which don't come with that crapware and don't report back if data is "tethered" or not. It's not hacking.
@_date: 2015-09-01 06:44:37
Yup, but thats actually the most bullshit part. My phone is mine and I will run whatever damn software I want on it. He doesn't know if they are tethering or not. Maybe they are running a full bitcoin node on their phone. Rooting it, or actually buying a phone which comes with free/libre/open source software /like bitcoin/ is not “hacking.” Of course, it's just a big distraction from the fact that he doesn't want to say how much data you are allowed to use, cuz it would be bad publicity, he just wants to try and spin the upcoming news stories by calling everyone who passes it "hackers", because god damnit, he is generous (just don't ask /how/ generous, cuz he aint that generous.) But we will find out soon enough when people report what happens to them.

That makes no sense. It's like saying I'm tricking you into tricking you, which breaks the contract.

Fair enough. My post was a bit overblown.

If it was so obvious, it would show up in google search results.


Nope. Reddit search results for UASF in bitcoin sub:
\  "As most of you know" ... blah blah blah. There is a github link tucked in there, but no suggestion that it is a recommended place to get UASF. Even if you are sophisticated enough to find the github link, that page still does not say "this is the place to get UASF", and will depend on sophisticated users to figure things out, like should they get "win64.zip" or "win64-setup-unsigned.exe", since they appear to be for same os.
\  which just links to  more "do not run bip148".
\  nothing.
