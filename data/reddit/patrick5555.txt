   The blockchain you downloaded is a record of every single transaction made with bitcoin, ever. You need that first because if you make a transaction, it needs to be added on to the latest block of the blockchain. 
   The wallet.dat file is the part that holds your keys, and if you downloaded the bitcoin client on  another computer, and replaced the wallet.dat from a computer that had bitcoins, you can now spend from both computers.
   If we stopped using gold as money, you could still use it for computers and jewelery, so it is not worthless
   The fiat monies only have value because the government says so, and they have nukes so you better listen to them
   Bitcoin only has value because WE say so, the mothafuckin free market is on a rampage and it says bitcoins are worth 10 bucks goddamit
   You wont hit memory problems or long download times because you already downloaded the whole blockchain. A new block takes less than  a second to download

I suggest taking  a look at the bitcoin wiki. We seem to have an error in miscommunication. When I say power, I am not speaking about how much  a bitcoin buys today, but rather the power behind the *concept* of bitcoin. A small group of people had central authority over the amount of zimbabwean dollars, and ultimately their value, bitcoin does not. Bitcoin is still very new, so volatility is to be expected. And since there is no other use for bitcoin than currency (like gold or silver), the value is completely determined by us, the consumer. And not being able to counterfeit them is icing on the cake.

Because most everyone that uses bitcoin must download the original blockchain, and in essence become central servers themselves. So when  a true block is solved, all of our blockchains agree, when a false block is attempted, no blockchains will agree with it, and 'forks' the blockchain for whomever tried to do it.

because there is the extremely dense and philosophical argument of "do we need the state for anything?"
pro state philosophy usually jumps right to the "we must have a state to enforce contracts"
a blockchain does not "enforce" so much as it provides an unalterable proof of both parties consent to contractual terms
now all we need is third party arbitration to become so much more preferable to the state that we don't even think about it

the bitcoin protocol states that after ~2 weeks worth of blocks mined the difficulty readjusts. it takes into account the total hashing power and adjusts the difficulty so a block is mined every 10 minutes. so if enough miners left at the same time, yes there would be a backlog of hashes to solve, but as soon as they solved enough blocks to trigger the difficulty readjustment, it would be back to business as usual
also, people that want their transaction confirmed faster can pay a fee. the fee goes to the miners, and does not halve

You do not need taxes to have a restitution system. The victims family has  a claim and many lawyers work for free up front because they know it is  a real claim and will get some of the compensation. This happens right now for auto accidents, slip and falls at businessess, etc. The fact that the current government violently restricts any dispute resolution system from competing with them does not mean you need taxes to have dispute resolution.

The block is solved when the winning hash is found. The winner recieves 25 btc and all the transactions fees during the round. The transactions that took place during the round now have 1 "confirmation", its considered truly secure at six confirmations.
No matter how much power you throw at bitcoin to solve the algorithms, it will readjust the difficulty so bitcoin blocks are always solved in approximately ten minutes.

In 1860 slavery was inherently a part of nation states and how society was organised.

I was afraid they would do that to me too, because my coins had appreciated 4$ apiece over five days, but everything went through fine.

This just sounds like growing pains honestly.

When you make a transaction, you are both making a "new bitcoin" and deciding where it belongs. I'm sorry if that was confusing but think about sending half  a bitcoin, in my mind this means you have created two "bitcoins" because they are their own amount.
So if a 51% can deny all transactions on the new block, he decides where all the "new" bitcoins go: nowhere
