But, us shibes don't know about it. Surely you'd make us aware?
It probably is in the sidebar, but that didn't catch my eye as much as seeing it as a comment. THank you!

Well, assuming that the bobsled team has actually been watching the news, I'm more than sure that they will thank us. After all, we came through when no one else did!

Decent! I'm writing a novel for a client, about 60K doge. Might co-publish for kindle, or some service that accepts doge.
Ready for the next Wolves and Weasels thread?

I think tipbot is banned in bitcoin :(. Or is it?

And yet it's not serious.
I've got a ~110K Doge. Not too much, but that's money. What did I do? I bought some stickers, and tip people.
I love bitcoin, for it HAS paved the way, and I thank it for that. But it can stay fun, too.

Not an army, more like a friendly hippy establishment that wants love.
Come join us! :)

No shit. That was amazing. Give him a shout out, he deserves it.

But if you want to hold money in something such as BTC, why doesn't DOGE work too? Technically, they're both the same. Just one laughs a bit more.

Well, the jamaica thing...that works...
Maybe take a browse in , I'm sure you can find some stuff there.

Hey GoodShibe! How's your day been?

You are arguing about cryptocurrencies, not grammar. Seriously.
