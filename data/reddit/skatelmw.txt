Same here...
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:33:24
So is it because of people cashing out or buying into BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:05:32
Luckily it was only 50$. It could have been a lot worse lol. Learned my lesson! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:46:29
Absolutely 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:38:33
Trust me. I know I'm a noob. I'm learning. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:46:04
In a way this is a good thing because I am learning from my mistake. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:13:10
I am taking responsibility for this because I basically guaranteed he would make money by Friday. I stretched the truth and I take responsibility for that. And I didn't really explain BTC to him very well. (He's not a huge fan of computers)
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:15:52
Yep. It sucks but I guess I learned my lesson lol. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 11:53:26
I put all the money I gained this week into it so I am really hoping it will go up. I am already at a pretty big loss. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:41:02
How did you come up with that number? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:21:58
I thought there were Ddos attacks? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:06:27
50$. It's a lot for me but I will be able to work it off in a month or two hopefully. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:23:38
Well it was his money actually... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:40:56
Yea very true. This really isn't a big deal at all. I just thought it was kinda funny. My dad will come around, he's just helping me understand investments. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:43:59
I accept my consequences with full responsibility 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:06:46
Indeed. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:34:24
But do you think it could ever surpass 200$ again?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:37:00
I don't have a job so I have to cut grass. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:15:01
I did not take enough time to explain BTC to my dad and that's my fault. I also am pretty new to the whole system. But I'm learning! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:34:03
170 USD I think.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:45:06
Anything between 15 and 25 dollars. But the weather has been really rainy lately and I haven't been able to cut grass yet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:19:43
Na I love my dad haha. And I'm on my phone...
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:38:31
Sounds like a good plan to me.
