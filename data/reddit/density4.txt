its not a coin, but soon you can invest in blockchain technology and bitcoin would be irrelevant
@_date: 2014-12-03 11:31:03
if you think bitcoins name will shine you are wrong like couple thousand delusional fans here
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:27:10
yes they need it, 3 biggest banks in the netherlands are working on it and it won't be called bitcoin

See Blockchain has future and not bitcoin, it's just a name but the underlying value which gives this name value is the blockchain
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:04:23
soon there will be blockchain investments without the bitcoin name, yes people are selling since a year ago

no not yet, it will take a while, but i dont see it going up ever again. bigger companies will have their own blockchain. bitcoin as a name is worthless, its the code and blockchain whicbh has value, i know you are invested in it but eventually it will get crushed by the competition

No bitcoin is just a name satoshi could call it satoshicoin, I'm talking about the name which is bitcoin. The real value is the blockchain and the tokens which are mined, not the name 'bitcoin'

blockchain technology from much bigger corporations will take it over, also other crypto technologies will appear which will make it much more more user friendly for common person to use, bitcoin is complicated and as a name will vanish

good that you understand what i mean
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:20:44
bitcoin is not the currency of the blockchain, it was just the first there are many blockchain currencies, the thing is bigger corporations with much more influence power will make their own blockchain and/or better and more consumer friendly blockchain technologies which will be not under the bitcoin name

i'm talking about bitcoin, blockchain has a future, not the name bitcoin, banks are going to use their own blockchain technology this will make bitcoin name irrelevant
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:51:40
you don't need to mine per se to use a blockchain, one thing is clear, if you think they will be using bitcoin you are wrong

hah you wanted to catch me on my post history don't you, well you failed. 
bit coins name doesn't have a future, its been clear since a year ago, price will make lower lows as better technologies will come with a different name
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:02:32
i up voted you because you are so smart, Of course it can function without bitcoin, bitcoin is just a name nothing else
@_date: 2014-12-03 11:31:46
thats why people are shorting the bitcoin name, it doesnt have a future
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:37:27
