lmao, scanned your comment and when I noticed this decided to ignore everything else. I have been in crypto for almost 5 years, you damn plebbish noob! You think you're really big guy, don't you? Ppl who assume things about me are not worth my time.

Litecoin always has long consolidation period and then makes a huge unexpected move. It was the best coin to invest in last year, did over x100 (from around $3 to a high of $420). Expect LTC $1000 within 3 months.

No, it's not like that. Facebook is a company with a CEO and shareholders. Litecoin is not a company, it is decentralised cryptocurrency that was fairly launched and has stronger fundamenetals than any other cryptocurrency out there - including Bitcoin. Charlie selling his litecoins to avoid conflict of interest is logical for one main and simple reason: a creator holding litecoins as an investment for a cryptocurrency that was designed to be DECENTRALISED goes against those fundamentals. By selling his litecoins, litecoin becomes even more decentralised and it encourages the litecoin community NOT to rely on Charlie, but to develop products and services out of their own. Furthermore, Charlie selling his coins might have been a requirement. 
As you are maybe aware, Charlie/LTC developers announced that there will be a "huge unexpected surprise" in 2018 for Litecoin, so his sell-off might also have something to do with terms/conditions they agreed upon with the entity related to that to be announced surprise.
You go shill your monero, eth, and bitcoin shitcoins. LTC is the only old cryptocurrency with a strong/huge community that was launched fairly, that doesn't deal with drama and scams, that was not premined, and that was not hardforked. 
LTC will be the winner.

Ok, maybe I was wrong about that - I don't know which other major cryptocurrency has lower fees - , but if the "lowest fees" part is only one point in that huge list. And so far nobody has been able to refute the other points. 
In short; LTC --&gt; buy buy buy.

He still have to pay taxes. Where I live, 1 January is the "measurement" date. It looks like that guy lost everything after 1 January 2018, and he was probably worth around 200 BTC around 1 January. I don't remember what 1 BTC was worth then (at least $2.5 million I think?), but he has to pay taxes over that. Maybe there are exemptions considering the volatility of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:48:36
No, probably Litecoin. It is the cheapest of the "big 3", the least manipulated, and with most going on and in development right now. Don't forget the "huge unexpected surprise" that will be announced anytime soon.
Litecoin saw the most growth of all major cryptocurrencies last year, I believe it went up like x100, while BTC only did x25 or something.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:12:18
Bullshit. Litecoin has recreated it and it is a much better cryptocurrency, one how Satoshi intended it. Are you bitcoin maximalists seriously claiming Bitcoin is more decentralised, secure, cheap, fast, and reliable than Litecoin!? LMAO! Litecoin is the closest thing to a fair, actually usable cryptocurrency out there. It was not premined like Bitcoin, it doesn't deal with political drama and bullshit like Bitcoin, it hasn't hardforked like Bitcoin - and is thus not a shitcoin like Bitcoin, and so on.
Stop making ridiculous, idiotic statements. 
Litecoin going to surprise people. All altcoins are shit, except LTC. Compared to LTC, even Bitcoin is a shitcoin.

No, I have always done it alone with my other devices, and it always worked. I hold the device in such a way that holding both buttons while plugging it in is not a problem at all (hold it in reverse). I probably tried it 50 times and used different USB cables and ports, nothing works. It keeps showing that error message. It's pretty much worthless device now..
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:56:23
Didn't mean it in a demeaning way, just that most traders tend to be losers. So "losers" in the sense that they will in the end lose, not the other meaning of the word.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:05:04
He sold it gradually to avoid conflicts of interest. But Bitcoin (shitcoin) shills wouldn't understand that as they only care about price and air drops of even more shitcoins.

Lol, BCH.

What are the other reliable options people have? Some facts about Litecoin:
* One of the longest existing cryptocurrencies that exists until this day.
* Traded on most major exchanges, including Coinbase.
* Litecoin doesn't deal with political drama like Bitcoin (and Ethereum to some extent).
* Litecoin's creator, Charlie Lee, is one of the most influential people in the cryptosphere. Charlie Lee helped built Coinbase to what it is today and has previous experience with other tech giants, like Google. In short; he's not a sketchy individual who just appeared from nowhere, he's been in the tech scene for a long time.
* Litecoin is the fairest coin of the "big three" because;
* 1) Litecoin did not hardfork like ETH &amp; BTC.
* 2) No "free air dorps", so the people holding Litecoin aren't one-day flies who just stayed around to take advantage of free coins. Litecoin is economically much more healthier than ETH &amp; BTC, as the latter two coins have relied/rely heavily on hardforks (free tokens as incentives).
* 3) Litecoin was not premined.
* 4) Litecoin didn't have an ICO.
* 5) Litecoin's creator doesn't hold any coins himself, which makes his views much more neutral and impartial. No conflict of interest in case LTC decides to "go big" with major companies/parternships.
* 6) Litecoin's creator is, unlike Bitcoin's, actually known. Satoshi Nakamota holds 1 million BTC and nobody knows who he is. No matter how you look at it, this is somewhat a risk for people holding large amounts of BTC.
* Litecoin has a healthy trading volume, which shows there is significant demand.
* There is a strong and growing Litecoin development team. 
* Litecoin will have all the features ETH has (including smart contracts) and more in the near future.
* Lowest fees. 
* Fastest confirmation times.
The list goes on, but I am really confident about LTC becoming huge later this year. It is simply the most fair cryptocurrency out there.
I don't understand the hate for LTC. LTC is basically the perfect Bitcoin :D.

Depends on where he traded. All legit exchanges have a strict KYC. If he traded on CB or GDAX, chances are the government does know about his balances.

You don't care anymore because deep down you know the bubble has popped, that the price will crash very hard, and you're just in denial.

It turns out it is my connection. When I login using a different internet connection, I don't get the robot verifications anymore and I can actually access my dashboard.
Anyone know why my main internet connection could be causing this? I connected the service provider and they confirmed there are no abnormalities, attacks, etc. of any kind, not even anything remotely suspicious, that they can detect. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:21:14
No it won't. Bitcoin is bearish right now, this is a massive bull trap. Should go sub $8 within 2 weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:40:19
I agree. The hype is over, price keeps going down, and all the bounces we've had seem like dead cat bounces. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:41:06
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:11:03
Because you can actually use it as a cryptocurrency? Why would anyone use bitcoin at this point? For the free air drops, pump and dumps, high transaction fees, long confirmation times, political drama? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:34:07
Yeah, I read the entire thing, but somehow forgot to mention that part in my submission. 
Trading brings the worst out in people. I too lost a lot of coins trading on leverage (around 15% of my stack). But the coins weren't worth that much back then, so I just ignore what they could've been worth today.
I tried trading, but I wouldn't recommend it. HODLing is by far the best strategy for people looking to invest in/make money with crypto. You simply can not outplay the whales or the manipulation. You might get lucky a few times, but the more you get lucky, the bigger the risks you're willing to take - and if it goes wrong only once, you're fucked. 
If you insist on trading, I recommend using a small portion of your stack (max 5%) and to only use a fraction of that portion with each trade. And if your trading portion goes below 5%, DON'T add to it from your reserves. If you lose that 5% than you know trading isn't for you, but you will at least have tried it without having lost everything like that guy and thousands of others.
Also, don't daytrade and have patience.

Nobody always holds, there will always be sellers. Mainly because there are miners who need to pay for their expenses. Holding = decrease in supply on exchanges, and if we expect demand to continue to increase, price will follow.

Good thing that what you consider doesn't matter at all.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:36:51
Nah, bitcoin is very vulnerable and monero is a joke. ETH is not comparable to Litecoin. Litecoin is truly the only cryptocurrency that can be used as such; for fast, decentralised transactions, and with a strong and healthy development team + community. ETH is good, but has different purposes. Bitcoin can't be used as a true currency, it is more a store of value.
So yeah, the 3 big ones are BTC, LTC, and ETH, but each of them are king in their own field.
LTC is king of payments. 
BTC is king of store of value.
ETH is king of smart contracts.
PS: LTC will also get smart contracts, so it will soon become competitor to ETH. LTC is an all-around, highly functionable, proven cryptocurrency with exceptional longevity. It is the oldest relevant crypto after BTC. 
LTC is simply the fairest coin, period. No premine, no ICO, no unknown creator with a million coins, no hardforks, no political drama bullshit, it isn't a platform for scams (many ETH-based coins are huge scams), and so on. Are you denying these facts?
