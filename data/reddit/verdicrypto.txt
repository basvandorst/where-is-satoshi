What exactly brought you to this conclusion?

What you listed, talking about both gold and water, is the utility. I agree with you that goods have intrinsic utility. Just like utility, scarcity as well is an intrinsic property (as I explain in the article), but what I'm trying to explain is that the concept of intrinsic value does not exist. 
The value of an object is given subjectively, which means that I could value something differently from what you value it depending on my, and your, needs and wants.
What you said about firemen, gardeners etc. explains partly the subjectivity of utility, which then contributes to the subjectivity of value. Intrinsic scarcity is objective, but intrinsic utility can be subjective.

Suppose that you're in a desert and you're dying of thirst. In this situation, a bottle of water has inestimable value. But if you're at home and you have a shelf full of water ready to drink, the value of a bottle of water is obviously way less.
Value is subjective, so what you consider the intrinsic value of water and food is their great utility for human beings. Even though it's true that we need them to survive, their value doesn't come from within, but instead from the individual that needs them.

But that's its utility, not intrinsic value. The value you give to Bitcoin is different from the value someone else gives, i.e. a Buddhist monk. For him, Bitcoin is useless, which means it has no value.
There's no such thing as intrinsic value. The value of Bitcoin is only subjective.
