a lot of web sites are  remunerated using ads. You could imagine a no ad feature integrated within your browser. When you arrive at a website your browser could let you choose to view the site without ad for a given price (let say a tenth of a cent) that would be sent directly to the developer for each page viewed. The browser will have access to a tiny wallet and will start paying, ensuring you are not paying twice when you access the page a second time, etc

Can you help me understand something about this mining thing?
If you look at the difficulty of mining bitcoins: 
We see a 50GHash/s device like the 21co will mine 3.782USD a month if it runs for 1 month full time.
But I guess this is assuming that the 21 pool wins the block, which if we look at  happens 5 times a day (so let say 3 or 4% of the time), so am I right in saying your "expected value" would be more around 0.13USD per month? (or is it really 3.78?)
This is without removing what 21co could charge as a fee (for using the pool) and the electricity you would consume.
Assuming the difficulty continues to grow (exponentially) it would mean that for the 21 pool to win you will need to add a lot of new users, and your gains will slowly go down (as you share with other users). Or 21 will loses more and more and your gains will go down anyway. I mean the difficulty goes up and your hardware is still doing 50GHash/sec so your gains have to go down.
This is not a troll, just an honest question. I am discovering bitcoin and trying to make sense out of it.
EDIT: no... that does not make sense. Somebody else please do the math please, I'm curious :)

I have it too.
But I deactivated on sites I like like Reddit because I believe they should be remunerated. I'd be willing to send tiny amount of money.
Another thing is for a big IT company. You want your developers to access an ad free web, but it would be seen as unfair to install adblocks on each computer (and maybe insecure or not resilient enough or illegal in the future). So the company is willing to pay for a better working environment.
Thanks to help me out now, I'm running out of arguments!

I understand shit in economics but it looks like we're saying the value of gold is reflected by the price of picks and shovels that are bought to mine it.
I don't know what makes bitcoin valuable today. Is it because it represents an idea of freedom? I mean at least picks and shovels could be bought for gold, you're not buying an S7 with bitcoins.

in the future you'll have to pay to access web pages, doing micropayments for each request. This technology will be integrated in your browser that will spend a tiny bit of money each time, using of course the *currency of the internet*
For crawlers like Google, they will need to do a lot of micropayments, adding to a lot of bitcoins.
There is a tutorial on 21 demonstrating this payment integrated into http. It requires both the server and client to use libraries from 21. Of course at the moment bitcoins is not ready for micropayments so 21 is acting kindof like a bank so to not add a transaction each time on the blockchain.

But when Facebook or Google "scale", they are making basically a better service, they are making more money. The software is more available. You are able to add new users, or new content. You create something worthy.
But mining is just creating heat. When you add a new miner to a mining pool, you create more heat. You don't support new users. You're not making more money. You're not making the software greater in anyway. In fact today you will add a miner to a mining pool. You won't make the system more trustworthy.
I think what bitcoin is missing is a proof of laziness. You would distribute the mining on thousand of miners (not a couple of pools) to make it more trustworthy. The proof of laziness ensures you keep an ecological friendly approach.
Edit: couple of downvotes here and there... why not making a comment to explain your pov? yes Im sceptical about bitcoin but that's understandable right?

I think the dream was that miners would contribute their resources for winning bitcoins and to increase the network of trust. I think that was the initial idea, and yes I find it truly amazing. I'm new to bitcoin and I find it amazing for a lot of reasons, but I might be mistaken on a few things too :)
Now look when you view [Life Inside a Secret Chinese Bitcoin Mine]( you understand what companies are willing to do once you can get money out of the "idea". When you look at the chart for [bitcoin difficulty]( this is the evolution of how heat is being generated, while basically not making the system any more trustworthy.
I'd totally agree with you if people would just be mining with their iPhone once a week, but now with dedicated hardware costing thousands of dollars (look at this [S7]( close to 3000$) that have a very limited ROI the whole mining thing looks like a big scam honestly. I like the idea of bitcoin, but its flaws scare me.

noob here
I had a look and the guy is using [this service](
basically you take a digital document and you compute a hash (or you take a small text of 40 bytes), you create a transaction and add to it a *OP_RETURN* op code containing that hash/text.
If you try to make sense out of [this transaction]( you see that it was a transaction that refers to a previous transaction proving that the owner has 0.0050B, and gives 0.0049B to the receiver and a 0.0001B fee. In the transaction a second output was added : OP_RETURN who works like [this](
I'm guessing that the 0.0001B fee is won by the miner who won the block btw.
If you don't want to pay for the service, you could take your 0.005 BTC and buy weed with it, adding the OP_RETURN code "for free" (right?) Or even just paying the fee of 0.0001B and do a 0B transaction [as suggested here](

I find the "trust someone, and if you get scammed trust somebody else" idea less appealing than the promise of the bitcoin whitepaper.
The whole point is to put the trust in a network. If you add to the computing power of one node of the network, you're just making harder for new nodes to come joining the network.
The idea of bitcoins that is appealing to me at the moment is to have independent miners, not joining the pool, and powered by some renewable energy like solar panels...
