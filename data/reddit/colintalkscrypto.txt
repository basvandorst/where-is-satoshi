Lol, I said we are in a bull market. You didn’t even bother watching my video.

That's unfortunate. I'm all about a free market. Let the best win.

There is absolutely a US tax on all gains made on all cryptos once you finally decide to trade them for anything or sell for fiat.

$39,375 is a ridiculously small amount of money.

You *do* get 0% on gains for crypto you’re already holding. The start date for this is Jan 1 of the year in which you become a resident in Puerto Rico (and qualify as a resident for Act 22)
Any gains made on pre-existing holdings *prior* to the year you move will be taxed at normal US rates.
But you don’t have to buy the crypto after you move or something. The amount you’re taxed on the gains is dependent on **where** you are at the time the gains are made.
It is divided into two buckets: gains made while in the states, and gains made while in Puerto Rico as a resident qualifying for Act 22.
As always: This is not legal advice. This is just my understanding from what I’ve learned. Consult a lawyer to make certain you are following the laws correctly.

Also, if you want to learn more about Act 20 and Act 22, I *highly* recommend these podcasts. They helped me immensely:
- Simon Black podcast - HIGHLY recommended (1 hour 30 minutes long but worth it!)
- Peter Schiff talks about why he moved to Puerto Rico:
Another HIGHLY recommended watch/listen!
- Mike Maloney says he lives in Puerto Rico &amp; Why:
(This is the Data Dash episode I referenced in my video)

Well I suppose you could also choose to not pay taxes. That's true, unless you know of another way.
Mike Maloney himself said Act 20 &amp; 22 are the only ways to legally reduce capital gains taxes down to 0% in USA:
