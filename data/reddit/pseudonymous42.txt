Why are you posting this question here? I'd give it a value of 1.5. I'd give it a higher value if there weren't other ways, old and potentially future ones, to store and transact value in a way that is decentralized, not under the control of any party and somewhat secure (although with some trade-offs and different characteristics) such as gold, bearer instruments, potential future crypto assets or quantum money. I'll explain why I give it such a value in a bit.


That is odd. What value are you giving to the related established power structures, first among them the central banks? Today I'd give them a value of 0.8, knowing that they have a limited lifetime left in which people can still be fooled by them. If we were in the year 1955 or so and you asked the same questions I'd give central banks a value of 0.5, knowing that they had a really strong grip on the alternatives at the time (private ownership of gold was illegal in large parts of the world, especially the most developed and powerful countries at the time, such as the US) and people didn't know as much about the role of money. At that point in history I'd also give nuclear weapons a 0.6, whereas today I'd give them a 0.9. The point is, the risks abate as people become wiser and develop alternatives.
To my main point: what the central banks with their inflatable fiat currencies and mortal banks do is create great costs and uncertainty in the long term, especially for those who rely on them the most: savers of fiat currency and interest-sensitive borrowers. Interest-sensitive borrowers may limit their borrowing for fear of getting lulled into over-indebtedness and then taken over through manipulating interest rates too high. This negatively impacts their competitiveness, unless they can find a good alternative way to fund themselves. Savers know that fiat money can be, and is being inflated at their expense, and banks can and do occasionally (or deliberately) fail, with costs to depositors (those who don't understand this get punished), therefore they are disincentivized from saving for the future, unless they go for an alternative to fiat currency. Both of these things disincentivize planning and developing things for the long term. This leads some people to ignore costs and risks beyond some shrinking time horizon. Needless to say that this negatively affects survival probability. Greater adoption of alternatives alleviates this.
Bitcoin does not introduce the same bad incentives/disincentives, no matter how widely adopted. To the contrary, it does have well aligned incentives, where people can be much more comfortable the longer their time horizon is, especially with saving. On top of that there are other major benefits to society, such as the ability to keep some transactions private, uncensorable, etc.
Edit: I should be giving central banks a worse factor than nuclear weapons at every point in history.

My favorite thing in 2015 was seeing many people who ignored Bitcoin at first, then starting to pay attention.

Apparently he used the word "corporation" in the sense of the corporatist ideology of Benito Mussolini and the like. Mussolini preferred the term "corporatism" instead of "fascism". The essence of that ideology is, course, the same then and now - merger of state and corporate power.

If they *claim* (it would be wrongful) I owe $500,000 worthless USD worth of back taxes they would have to sacrifice $500k worthless USD's worth of goons' lives on the altar of statism. I would fight.

Well, I see how it might take some getting used to, but I think there can be no question that overall it is a good thing to transition away from tax evasion (which involves false declarations) and into complete tax freedom (think tax resistance). This is exactly what Bitcoin can help tremendously with. Especially for a software company it shouldn't be too hard to operate in a completely confidential, pseudonymous way so that there is no chance tax authorities can even find the people behind the company. If you try to have no dealings at all with the government (simply don't file anything) and use only bitcoin, you can be safe from their harassment.

Well, if that is the case, he better make up his mind about honesty because there is nothing honest about funding government. I see what you possibly mean - that if a person has the mindset that he owes taxes, then paying would technically be an honest *act* with respect to the perceived obligation. However, it doesn't make a honest *character* when supporting the most dishonest thing there is in this world. Therefore, being honest can never be an explanation for wanting to pay taxes.
As for risk aversion - it can be deceptive. Some actions that may be perceived as risk averse may in fact set you up for tremendous risk while providing no real benefit at all.

Really. You seem to be much more concerned about the government getting taxes and getting entertained watching you jump hoops than your business doing good. You seem to be much more worried about it than even the people in the government themselves.
Bitcoin is presenting you the opportunity to become completely independent of the government - no taxes, no hoops, and you *choose* to stay with the government? It takes strong ideological conviction or indoctrination to do that if you ask me - thus I label you a [fascist]( Your ruin.

It may be illegal, but it is both unprovable (if done right) *and* moral.

They also inevitably fund people confiscating other people's property and taking away their freedom for simply refusing to participate. This is what makes paying taxes immoral. If you choose not to participate (don't pay anything to the government, don't expect to get anything from the government) this is morally right.

Well, maybe I didn't use the word the way I should have. What I want to say is that not only is it not immoral - it is actually *the morally right thing to do*. Am I clear now?

Governments are the ultimate originator of hard-to-clean taint.
They still have the nerve to label other organizations terms such as "criminal enterprise" while it is patently clear that they are the mother of all criminal enterprise.

I think that this comment by mkiwi will be the winner. For that reason I'm willing to bet **10 times** what mkiwi gets from VicDamoneJrJr as the giveaway that I will lose! **I have 10 BTC of my own money to bet. Anyone can take my bet**. If you think that I can win the giveaway you can take my **10 BTC bet**. If I win the giveaway you win the bet. I'll then divide the bitcoins equally among everyone who takes my bet in a comment here before 7 PM Pacific time on March 31st (if you already commented, you can edit your comment). **You don't need to put any of your money in - there is no risk for you if you take my bet!**

People in power have been notoriously short-sighted for things which have a lot of downside and little upside, the opposite of Bitcoin. Such things are major world currencies, empires, corporations, etc.
