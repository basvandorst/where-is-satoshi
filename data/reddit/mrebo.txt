Why? He has tons of data to back up his chart. You have... skepticism? I am inclined to believe the one who backs up their arguments.

True if new

I am not talking about turkey. I am noting your description of the situation there very much describes the US. In the US, debt has skyrocketed - we all buy everything on credit, i.e the banks own everything and we spend our whole lives working to pay interest and rent.

This describes the US just as well.

The only part of this that makes sense is "past performance is not indicative of future performance" which invalidates all your other FUD. Why would you say that after claiming it's going to repeat the exact drop from 2014? Everything is different this time, go back to hybernation, ��.

Presumably this is due to the automatic difficulty adjustment. The hash power is much lower on the new chain, so the difficulty decreased after the first couple blocks to compensate?

The world's wealth may be finite, but this log chart uses BTC price in USD as one of it's axes. The idea is that BTC is a black hole that will absorb all wealth currently tracked by fiat, so, after a couple more halvings, one of these axes (USD) won't have meaning anymore. The BTC/BTC price will be 1, which is the asymptote of this chart.

Blockchain tech isn't really anything without the network effect and decentralized mining network. A "private blockchain" is just a slow, overly complex database. This is the dumbest thing ever - JD doesn't understand what he has stepped in but he soon will. His entire business is going to be disintermediated by Bitcoin. RIP Chase bank.

Except it's been going up strongly all year throughout the bear market. It doesn't seem like there is a reason it would lag by 9 months.

No, the whole point of his argument in OPs post is he is already wealthy enough. He won't care, he will still be wealthy and at that point probably one of his broad index funds will have added BTC exposure. Very rich people mostly just want to preserve their wealth, they don't need any individual asset to moon.

This isn't true at all. See this very coherent thread: 
Basically, if you provide enough incentive with fees for miners, you CAN reorg the blockchain as long as you are willing to spend more in fees than has been spent / gained in work on the chain since the transaction you want to roll back. As more confirmations pile up, it gets more and more expensive to reorg.
This is Bitcoin working as intended either way. This is why you wait for many confirmations if you want to legitimately move tens or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.

Um... According to them. Not your keys...
Try to withdraw, then you will find out for sure.
