Pretty green to this, could someone explain how he could prove he's Satoshi?
 I keep reading comments about codes and how it's easy but it's all over my head

Yea that doesn’t qualify as satire. Just an extremist. No bad guy thinks he’s doing the “wrong” thing

@_date: 2017-02-10 15:34:15

Rosie, I just emailed the address you gave me, thank you.
Just as a reference, the money I deposited was supposed to be in the account yesterday, but it's still not there. It was however withdrawn from my bank account.

Yea you're clarification about supply and production is true. 
Could you explain how bitcoin production stays fixed regardless of the resources? I'm a bit naive in this department.
*Does that mean for example: 20 Blocks are given out per year regardless of whether or not there are 5 miners evenly mining and each getting 4 blocks or 4 miners doing 50% of the total computing and 1 miner doing the other 50% giving the first 4 miners 10 blocks and the last miner the remaining 10?
As to your triangle..
1) I agree
2) Do they not have inherent equity when value is so sparatic? In my eyes BTC seems more of an asset at the moment than a currency.
3) Yes, but is it not more vulnerable when it is not yet a commonly traded currency and is so young?

Live next to their head quarters. Can confirm their burgers are tasty

Sorry I miss-spoke. I meant if they want to maintain their reward income or bitcoin flow they will need to increase mining power.
I'm clearly missing some technical knowledge, as I don't understand why more mining power wouldn't mean more blocks for an individual miner?
@_date: 2016-07-05 22:03:33
So, with the upcoming halvening if a miner wants to maintain their flow of blocks, then they will now need to double their mining power, no?
EDIT: that chart is very interesting! It looks like the miners are all playing off the consequences of effort from last cycle.

I understand *Why* this is proposed, but does anyone think this could lead to governments tampering with the system? 
Not for their own monetary gain rather confiscating funds, etc.

You have some really good points, I'm on mobile and will reply on 30 min
EDIT: Okay again i want to reiterate that this is just my idea, i'm defending it so that when/if mi proved wrong that I believe it. Unless Bitcoin's worth is belief based then, crap.
Anyways, I think most of your points fall under the use as Currency side of the triangle. They are definitely benefits, but aren't the largest source of it's value, IMO. They are also very weakened by the fact that in terms of other assets (FIAT, Gold, etc.) They are rarely accepted anywhere. So if you have the capability of trading an alligator anywhere in the world with all those benefits that's great, but how many people are accepting alligators?
Assuming you're points are valid as to it's worth were a large source of it's value I think they would still fall when one of the other weak sides of the Triangle collapsed, no?
btw thanks for the reply!

Hmm, so it could be possible a miner(s) caused this too? Hoarding then letting them loose
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:05:10
I must be tired or something, I reread what was said and yes, duh. I misunderstood.
Thanks for hangin in there for me!
