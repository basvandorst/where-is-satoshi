You are comparing something **very** centralized, to something that is supposed to be **very** decentralized.
Please, stop.

You would think that chain with 95% of hashing power would be the 'main chain'.
But what do I know, a random user on the Internet will explain us what the main chain is, I guess.

Oh God, this is so beautiful and true :)

Yes, because obviously one needs to be a 'shill' to talk about fees.
Whether someone is spamming the mempool is irrelevant, if BTC can be brought to a halt with such a simple 'attack', then it should be not only discussed, but discussed a lot. 
I still can't quite figure out which echo chamber is worse.

Oh crap, I registered on reddit yesterday and never used it before (was lurking for years), apparently reddit is hard, I thought I was responding to someone completely different who messaged me about something else. Whoops.
I apologize for making a reply that probably makes no sense, haha. 
edit: To clarify, I did get those transactions of mine confirmed within 40 minutes (yeah, luck, so I am very lucky it seems), and they did cost around a $1, it's not a bedtime story. I am just tired of the constant "takes days, costs $[insert_random_number_here]" nonsense.

What you are saying makes no sense.
This is not an 'early vs late adopters' story at all.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:31:32
You forgot to mention $40 transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:49:19
**What are your fees ?**
*We charge 1% for outgoing payments a minimum of 0.004 BTC. This includes the best mining fee to get your transaction swiftly into the blokchain.*
Just to make sure you didnt miss it:
**0.004 BTC**

I don't get it.
I must be a genius or something, since I am making non-segwit transactions with fees under a dollar, for the last week. Getting 6 confirmations within 30-40 minutes.
Am I really that fucking smart?
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:29:53
Where is it, I can't find it?
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:34:49
And this is exactly what I am talking about.
How do you expect anyone to take you and/or your list seriously, when you don't seem to understand the most basic concept?
Do you understand what an 'average' means?
Since I can't be bothered to look for my old transactions, I will just show you block list from today.
Please tell me how many minutes did it take for 6 confirmations that are marked red? Actually, don't need to tell me, I know how long it took. It was rhetorical question, obviously. There is **at least** one more set of 6 blocks that fits under 40 minutes, not going to spend more time on this. Sigh.
I did try to tell you why I find it hard to switch fully to BCH, and you seem to confirm my sentiment. You don't seem to appreciate the time I spent trying to craft the post, so I really don't see it as beneficial to either me or you to continue.
And I need you to understand something - I am not a BTC developer, or zealot, or hardline supporter - I am just a user. And even I know this basic thing, yet you who want to make the arguments against it have no idea how it works.
Good luck with your list and I also wish BCH good luck.
**edit: Crap, to give context - I thought I was responding to something else, this reply makes no sense but no point in removing it either (then beetlefeet's respond won't make sense, and so on :)**

Was the intercontinental ballistic missile delivered by USPS, as well?
I don't care if Roger sold firecrackers or any other shit. He was in jail for that, he did the time.
But, please, don't justify/rationalize it.
