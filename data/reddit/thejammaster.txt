So... Why would pills that cure cancer not be valuable?
Fingernail clippings??? 
What a POS garbage article.

Bad reviews is not aggressive. It is honest. Bad companies should be known as such.

He also is going to get an 86 million dollar tax write-off
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:36:40
Thank you for the clarification. Go OP!
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:15:07
I don't know that it's necessarily a bad thing. It's kind of a win-win. He either donates to charities or pays the IRS. I'd prefer he did the former.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:18:09
You're being a d-bag dude.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:50:33
Do we get to read his summary?
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:06:36
And like Amazon and Wal-Mart.
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:43:19
It's all mapped out. We're just following the timeline.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:05:48
It seems like they could fund those things and still have like 9 trillion left over with how much money they get from taxes.
Oh wait.

That's why I put "zero" with quotation marks. And I said that any price above production cost should be the value of the utility of the asset.
What did I miss?
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:26:47
He's right.
Take a look at the charts for any penny stock. Zoom all the way out so you can see the whole thing. Now do the same for the Bitcoin chart. Notice any similarities?
One difference, right? Bitcoin is at $6400 and penny stocks are almost $0. 
Well that's because it's expensive to mine BTC, somewhere to the tune of $6000 - $6400 per bitcoin. It costs $0 to produce a stock for a company, more or less. Any price above the cost of production should be the value of the utility of the asset. 
So bitcoin is essentially at its "zero" price. According to its chart it is not much more than a failed stock. A penny stock. Most penny stocks never recover.
That said, it seems to at least be stable. For now.
@_date: 2018-10-28 16:39:14
Ah. Well, I see where the miscommunication happened. 
I gave a range for the cost to produce 1 BTC as 6k - 6.4k because I am unsure of the actual cost to produce one. 
I mentioned the utility value because I am granting that it is already baked into the price.
Penny stocks aren't $0, so I guess the term 'zero' price is convoluted. Equilibrium price is a better term. I just thought that, in the context of my entire post, it could be understood what I meant. I should have been more clear.

I'm basing this projection off of the graph for SPX (S+P 500). I'm on mobile so I can't really post any TA, but if you zoom way out on the weekly chart or daily chart the pattern should be pretty apparent.
Note significant peaks and troughs, sharp dropoffs, etc.
These are "landmarks" that help you orient yourself within the fractal.
From memory there is a formation that I nicknamed a "razorback" formation which is a sort of series of small ascending humps reminiscent of a hog's back (in my mind anyway). I believe we are not too far past that formation currently, but I haven't looked at that chart in a couple weeks.
Hope that helps.

Absolutely if he ever wants to make it to the 1%.
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:38:30
I wouldn't call it science at all.
Edit: Cool dismissive attitude, btw
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:33:06
I don't have any money
Edit: Also nice try SECguy lmao

I see what you might have done there

Bitcoin will be worthless by Summer 2019.
These people are both "self-help" type speakers and their audiences are impressionable and likely to follow their suggestions. 
This is a coordinated ploy to rob weak minded people of their money.

I'm all for it. I wish more people would get mad more often about things that warrant an angry response.
Anger is as much a valid emotion as any other and is useful, necessarily so, or else it probably wouldn't exist, evolutionarily speaking.
I'm personally sick of being financially raped by big corporations and our government. Isn't that what the entire cryptocurrency movement is supposed to be about?

Who is the Twitter user?
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:21:14
Stock market will slowly decline until summer 2020.
Then it drops.
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:59:14
The markets move in fractals. Patterns that repeat on large and small scales within themselves.
At the rate we are going, judging by the point we are at in the current fractal, we should be due for a sharp drop off near the end of summer 2020.
That's a rough estimate because the fractals do have a small amount of variance, but are generally pretty close.
It also makes sense because 2020 is a presidential election year and economic turmoil is a good catalyst for increasing voter participation.
All they have to do is paint the picture of whoever they want to win. We eat out of their palms like goats at the petting zoo.
Edit: Small error. Even I forget that your votes don't really count. My mistake.
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:30:44
Lmao.

Ermagrerd, there could be a million cryptos then bitcoin would be worthless!
Just take 5 seconds to think about the concept before you speak. It's ridiculous and makes no sense. It isn't worthy of even this response.
