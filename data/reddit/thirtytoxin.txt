I love all the support here. I empathize with OP's brother and hope he will rest in peace. I once had around 1000, for the wrong reasons. Got seized on the darknets. Sometimes I tell my family and friends I should commit suicide because i'll never have that opportunity again. I say it as a joke, but theres some truth to every joke

Weird, I posted this and was flagged and removed for posting about a "non bitcoin" alt coin...

Investigation follows, Bitcoin Cash developers and C- level execs get brought to light. Bcash plummets.

If you go on blockchain.info it shows slushpool as only 12.1% of the total hashrate...Antpool is still 18.5%. Somewhere someone is putting out misleading information

Wow this was beautifully put! Saving to use in future arguments wih idiots..

I would love if this were true, however BCH keeps pumping up and BTC keeps tanking..
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:15:11
Because theres a chance it might be true!
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:15:13
Awesome, hope you're somewhere on the east coast!

Lol what hostility and ASSumption. I'm in the bitcoin camp my friend. A day or two ago bitcoin was almost at 20k. So yes in my eyes, my account is tanking indeed.
