Which will work for a period while keeping the same UX, better than fucking up the UX and driving users away.

I'm Brazilian, don't live there anymore but this is **NOT** a good sign for Bitcoin.
I've had friends showing me pictures of flyers being distributed in the urban trains and metro of my hometown (São Paulo) with stuff like (and I'm not shitting you): "Invest now in Bitcoin! Guaranteed returns of 10% per month! The technology developed by Russians going back to 1989". One thing you have to keep in mind is that people who use public transportation in Brazil are either VERY poor (as they can't afford a car) or VERY rich (as in they live very close to their commute so can take the subway for 10~15 min instead of poor people going for 3+ hours commute).
And stuff that ends with "Bitcoin, together we are stronger.", really, this is a fucking ponzi scheme going on and **NOT** good for crypto or people at all.

Have I called Bitcoin a ponzi scheme? I'm calling out that **IN BRAZIL** what is currently happening is that there are a lot of ponzi schemes backed on Bitcoin, either by piggybacking on its fame or by people playing as middlemen. This is not good for anyone involved, either Bitcoin community or the poor and uneducated people falling for this, so this news is not a good thing and should be understood on its context.
I really hate how defensive you get just by not understanding what I said... Stop having knee-jerk reactions, it looks really bad on you.
