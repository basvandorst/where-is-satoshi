First email, no response. Follow up, no response. After the 3rd follow up email i got this 
" Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out. I understand your frustrations with this account issue and appreciate your patience.
I’ve documented the information you’ve provided and have escalated this case to a specialist. We will follow-up with you as soon as we have an update.
Please note that while these reviews are typically completed within 5-7 business days, it can sometimes take longer.
Thanks again for your patience with this.   "
After a few weeks passed I asked for another update and got this days later
" Hi there,
After reviewing your account, I noticed a transfer was created but never processed. This pending transfer was preventing you from closing your account. I went ahead and cancelled it, so you should be set to close it.
To close your account please visit this link: 
You will need to scroll to the bottom of the page to see the ‘Close Account’ section.
Thank you for being a valued Coinbase customer and we hope to see you again soon.
Coinbase Support"
I fortunately will never be a 'valued Coinbase customer' again.

I had to email them 4 times before they sent back a response saying the account will be closed.
