I dumped all the keys that are in the "recieving" section 3 days ago, swept those into electrum and no good :(
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:08:10
Yes. I have the details of the "transaction" that depleted the total, and since then they've not appeared in the target wallet, or come back to me. 
I'll PM you the details
@_date: 2015-12-18 11:28:42
Really disappointing :(
Moreso because i dont know why it happened or what i could do to stop it happening again
@_date: 2015-12-18 12:28:49


The 1.9~ and 1.8~ are rough, the 2.4 and 1.6 are close enough (the 2.4 was over, and i believe i sen the change back after sending to another controlled wallet.
It's definitely the correct transaction that sent to the 4.1 BTC INTO my wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-18 11:31:37
I found the account that had them first (sent it to me)

I've got about 4 levels deep till they hit these weird acocunts with MANY transactions and stopped trying to import keys.
I also dumped the WHOLE wallet and found all the change keys, it wasn't in any.
The transaction that errored and went missing is worth 1.9.
It was sent on the 5.12.
Let me know if this helps at all! 50 bucks coming your way if you can find em
@_date: 2015-12-05 12:00:30
Definitely need to upgrade, but didn't want to do it while the transaction was "Hanging" I assume that upgrading would wipe all my data potentially - I'm still a bit new in this sense and not sure if that's a risk:
Version number is :0.8.1-beta 
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:42:40
I have swept all keys in the "recieved keys" section.
Coins didn't show up.
I've read that theres "Change addresses" that aren't visible - Could they be there? How do i find out all those
@_date: 2015-12-06 01:17:29
Hey, not 100% sure what this means.
I've let the blockchain update, but still no update (nor on blockchain.info.
This is 24 hours+ now.
I've started the upgrade process the new version of the client, but Ran out of room on my HD for the blockchain (Dont know how this is bigger than the last one, and for some reason, old version still works (even when i delete the blk.dat files)
Completely stuck as to what the next step is here.
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:02:43
Getting stuck with how to import it into electrum. It asks for private keys, or address.
I've seperately swept all the public keys on the wallet (of all the addresses that are listed in the "recieving" but i've learnt there's other change addresses too. (this was done 2 days ago - I found .1 of the BTC).
Any insights for how to do this?
@_date: 2015-12-05 12:26:37
Thanks for this info. This actually filled in the knowledge gaps i had here completely.
Appreciate this a lot!
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:55:38


Giving this a go now.
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:54:38
How do i fgure out my address? I have about 20 recieving addresses in my qt. How do i find the 1 for the client?
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:07:29


After rescans and everything the balance is still at 0.
It's big transfer too I'LL PM you the details
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:03:27
How do i find all the addresses? I've swept the public keys to the ones in "recieving" but I don't think that's all the ones associated with the wallet
@_date: 2015-12-18 12:12:32
I spent the 4.1 in two transactions a 1.9 and a 1.8, there was then some change.
Spent on nov 19~ and spent on december 5.
I dont have control over the 18~ BTC wallet
@_date: 2015-12-05 12:06:38
Will do,
So the transaction that's been sent, but isn't on the network will just be picked back up?
Are those coins lost? (Is there a timer or anything where they get sent back to the wallet if they don't make it anywhere?
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:52:48
Does anyone know how to use -dumpwallet correctly?
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:12:58
Thats the part i get stuck on. How do i know which address had the BTC before i sent it? It's on none of the transaction info. It only gives a to and transaction ID
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:43:14
How do I figure out where this was sent?
The tranasction did not go through, and is not visible anywhere on blockchain. They're just gone.
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:44:29




@_date: 2015-12-18 11:28:16
Dumped all the private keys - found about .15 of it :(
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:02:28
Trying now.
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:20:28
Transaction ID isn't on the blockchain at all, and as above, I swept all the public keys in my "recieving" section.
I read something about change wallets, but not sure how to find those all out/what to do next! :(
@_date: 2015-12-14 10:57:19
Swept the private keys into elec, I'm missing a significant amount of BTC.
One of the transactions i sent before the wallet broke never made it to the destination, and i dontknow how to tell if it came back
will to send a little your way if you can help me figure this out
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:41:16
Did that,
The transaction dissapeared, the coins did not return. Any other ideas?
@_date: 2015-12-05 12:01:24

@_date: 2015-12-17 10:41:54
I likely included a fee. It's been over 2 weeks.
Happy to share tranasction ID.
Will send now via PM
@_date: 2015-12-18 12:44:51
What are wallet recovery services? Any links?
I'm definitely not liking the idea of having to share it - Just running out of optiosn  :(
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:44:06
How do i do that?
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:25:54
How is this commonly done?
What's the simplest way now?
This is more my long term holdings, so looking for the correct solution longer term here
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:58:16
Haven't seen this. Watching now - Thanks
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:25:14


might be too late to get a ledger nano - Will opt for electrum.
Thanks for the advice - Will look further into this.
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:38:32
I just tried that then , It actually said no, but indicated there was a way - (using Copay).
I think it only lets you if it's hardware - So mycellium uses trezor? Is that how it works?
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:07:47
I've made a mycellium account - I've got the 12 words as well - What happens in the event he mycellium account stops working - is that a loss of BTC at that point
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:12:59
Links dead :(
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:56:40
Haven't tried. Don't know for sure if i'd trust that. Seems a bit sketch
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:07:58
reading this has raised a question for me...
How exactly is this possible?
I thought someone needed your wallet.Dat AND your passphrase to access your wallet?
What steps should i be taking here to ensure security?
Sorry for the noob question! :(
@_date: 2013-04-23 06:39:09
really good point, but how much of the market share do you think are in it currently for profit and how much do you think are to support the currency, IMO I think more would be in it for the profit.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:31:02
Well, i've been staring at it for he past hour and as of 5 minutes ago, i now have 2 confirmations...
I have no idea why this one took 24+ hours, but thanks for the help and advice :D i've now set a fee manually and learnt more about that processs :)
@_date: 2013-06-25 06:30:33
I feel like it definitely has something to do with that, especially based on the fact that the statement says that they wanted to work in line with legal.... etc.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:25:54
How is that a Freudian slip, I think im missing it,
Accidental Alliteration Alternatively?
@_date: 2013-06-24 14:17:26
spendbitcoins is stupidly expensive. the ex rate is always about $10 bucks above what it should be and the commision is huge!
What other options do we have?
@_date: 2013-05-19 01:27:22
What does this mean for bitcoin? Anything?
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:09:18
the standard .005?
is that the default with the QT wallet? I've changed nothing and usually i get an alert asking to pay the fee and i just hit yes?
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:28:02
Only downside to CJ is it requires an account and a wallet with them, no direct deposits.
Additionally, omnicoins is sold out of bitcoints, lol
@_date: 2013-08-27 09:18:46
Awesome, cheers for the update :D have you got a link to follow that?
@_date: 2013-05-19 05:38:36
What kind of impact does this pose for the adoption of bitcoin? since the Dwolla stuff ive noticed that BTC has risen about 15 dollars. Kind of weird considering they just got a lot harder to get**?
@_date: 2013-04-17 11:53:53
Ah awesome, such a huge wall of text and such a simple answer.
So they are future proof, but only a little bit :)
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:56:04
seems like that could be very profitable potentially -  How do you pay with them - Cash at bank or online purchse through CC?
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:19:12
I think it's the .0005
I've never had to wait more than 10-15~ minutes for the first confirmation, so i'm not sure why these haven't gone through in &gt;24 hours :S
How long until it just refunds it?
(i've also checked the recievers wallet on blockchain.info which shows nothing incoming)
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:57:44
Missed that entirely, Nice catch! 
@_date: 2013-06-25 06:30:50
Probably as its not as instantaneous?
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:29:07
Thanks again mate, ended up going through this mob. This 4 hour seems like it could be exploited quite easily?
Keep printing off the slips things, and if the price goes in up in that time, deposit?
