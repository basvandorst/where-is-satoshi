If that were true, we’re all gonna be in massive debt...

The best part of this will be in 10 years when someone shares this video and we all laugh at how cheap it was in 2017.

My immediate thought upon seeing the wording OP used was that he was going to get murdered in the comments for saying “trading” instead of just buying. Boy was I wrong! The top comments at the moment are awful - Besides the blatant he-man-woman-hater mentality, the people shaming him for using his money like money is a head-scratcher. If everyone treats Bitcoin like an investment instead of money, then it will never replace fiat (and I’m ethically opposed to diamonds but what you do with your money is not my business).

I think the technology of monetary compensation would be way more evolved than a blockchain system, so 1 Bitcoin is useless and likewise an iPhone wouldn't function for similar reasons. Iodine tablets only make sense if you were transported into an area with a radiation problem that there was an escape from. If the whole world was decimated by a nuclear war, iodine isn't going to help. A loaded Glock is tricky because as a tool, it only has one job - to kill. It could be taken as an act of aggression just to possess such a weapon if civilization has progressed for 1,000 years, so it would more than likely just get me killed or arrested. That leaves me with the hatchet &amp; tarp. Both could serve multiple functions to help create a shelter, chop wood, self defense, etc.
