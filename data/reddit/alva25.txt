hello -Olaf-
please respond to my pm and thread here
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:14:41
nice one, do you have a coinbase account?
and yes they have the right to determine who they want as they are customer
but i have the right as well to speak if my money is missing lol. any way if they answered my first support mail after 24 hours in the first place i would have not send tones of mails. i needed that money for urgent use now it all a pain in the ass because i cant do anything but just to find a way out.
to get my money back.. if they responded to me i would have not posted here.. i posted here because i found this post
here before, which is useful. so i am just waiting respond
thanks
