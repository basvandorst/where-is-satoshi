How much would you keep in a BRD app wallet? Do you spread your BTC?

Only via debit or credit cards at the higher fee rate of 3.9%.

Should have bought Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Tesla stock in Dec/January. It’s only crypto that moons, right?

Bit of an odd comment? Revealing how much you own and kind of irrelevant to everyone?

Casual $6m Redditor over here.

Black Friday sales time. Get one today as a Christmas gift for a loved one.

Weird to think that most of the people posting those are probably 25-35 and not teenagers.
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:13:35
“Redditor for 2 days”... here to spread FUD?
@_date: 2019-11-30 19:08:01
Paper wallet could have been just as good. Dude supposedly didn’t write down keys, that’s playing with fire.

Happy Halloween ��.
What will today bring?

Don’t think the universe is going to notice our tiny little gas problem on Earth. Time to invest in non-milky way futures?

Didn’t get my buy in in time!

That’s nothing, my great grandfather bought the first ever bitcoin by trading potatoes in the 1800s. Satoshi stole his spudcoin idea and Vitalik his spud contracts. Hodl until the dinosaurs come back around.

... panic and call your mom?

If 1BTC = $1,000,000 x 0.04 = $40,000
And the other way round works too. If you want to wait until your BTC is worth a target amount, say randomly you want $5000, then $5000 divide by 0.04 = 125,000 so 1 BTC would have to equal that ($125,000) for you to pocket $5000
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:40:25
Thank you.

Go you. Nice!

That’s why rich firms developed arbitrage and minor flunctuation bots because we (bags of meat and flesh) are bad at it by and large!

Bitcoin in 2030 - still waiting for “adoption”, barely alive or thriving?
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:58:46
Right now, agreed = definitely too techy, full of nerds and not particularly accessible to all. Better, more friendly design without the “holier than thou” know-all geeky behaviour needs to go to be receptive at welcoming Joe Public.
@_date: 2018-07-26 07:00:43
Draper is doing good things to grow his stack... I mean increase adoption for the good of everyone.
His VC companies have invested in multiple crypto companies like Ledger. Go Tim!

Focusing on the daily is all too tempting. We reached $7.5k - a sell off / correction was inevitable.

That’s not an “only” amount. You’re part of a small club at that amount... as much as it might not feel like it.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:18:55
Because you wanted to diversify your portfolio?
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:14:49
No need to be hostile. Everything has a learning curve and this guy was just voicing his opinion, one I agreed with when I started.
Transferring to a wallet from an exchange felt like a risk. Nobody wants to risk their money over an admin mistake like that.
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:14:21
10%+ growth in only 1-3 days is not sustainable, and any humans involved will hedge their bets (especially the day traders). It will consolidate and start again, hopefully still bullish.
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:25:38
Profit taking from the day traders. Hopefully sentiment will stay the same next week and continue to build again.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:39:21
Money happened.

Hostile response much. What would your mother think of you speaking like that?
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:21:00
Keep reading and learning, it will become easier.
Improved user interfaces and better marketing are coming.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:13:06
Be nice. His opinion counts.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:40:43
I agree. And honestly, as mentioned previously, Coinbase is probably the easiest to do (providing you can ID yourself) to get started with credit card payments into crypto.
Step 2 is then transferring out to a wallet. The easiest I’ve found is Bread and LoafWallet. I’ve never tried a full paper wallet myself.
On the other hand, some big banks have dreadful user interfaces for paying and moving money around - so it is not unique to crypto.
