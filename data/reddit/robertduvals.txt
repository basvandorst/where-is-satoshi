130K bitcoins were stolen from drug dealers last night.
Drug dealers are a huge portion of bitcoin demand.  If the drug dealers leave bitcoin, then demand for bitcoin lessens considerably.

I have $3.50 worth of bitcoin and I have pledged to pay college tuition for each of a class of 15 third-graders who end up graduating high school.  I am confident that the bitcoin will grow to cover the cumulative cost in 9 years.

Everyone always focuses on the transaction fees.  What about the cost of just holding this 'currency'?  The value of BTC can easily swing 5% in just a single day.  Who the hell wants to use a currency that can lose 5% in value while your  waiting for a transaction to go through?

Usually people adopt things that solve some problem.  The only problem bitcoin 'solves' is money laundering and drug transactions.  Unfortunately for bitcoin, there are so many scams that even those solutions are becoming worthless.

It would be easy for a bank to set up a bitcoin clone and to start driving the price of the bankcoin up enough to attract interest from speculators.  Remember, bitcoin's market cap is less than $5 billion, which is nothing for a big bank.  A big bank could have the price of a bankcoin driven up to $300 in probably less than a month.
Once speculators see a 10x or 100x gain in bankcoin, the speculators will jump in and help the bank drive up the price of bankcoin.  Of course, just like satoshi, the bank would be smart and mine a million or three of the  bankcoin before releasing bankcoin to the public.

Bitcoin crashed from $290 to $250 today because people are starting to realize that it is too insecure to use.  Meanwhile, the fiat dollar is on a tear and the Federal Reserve was in a panic today trying to talk it down.
Stay long bitcoin if you like, but be prepared to lose your shirt.

By "most" do you mean "least"?

It would be nice to know the depth of the fiat-to-bitcoin market (and vice versa).

I heard satoshi was the one who created the willy bot at Mt Gox that drove up the price to $1,000.  Don't say he's never done anything for the community.

Bitcoin has lost over 70% of its value in about 15 months.  Bitcoin inflation way outpaces dollar inflation.

Ron Paul has been predicting hyperinflation in the US forever.  It hasn't happened.  The guy is pretty much wrong about everything but clueless libertarians hang on his every word.

Yes, the dollar is about to collapse.  That is why the Treasury has to pay a whopping 2% for 10-year bonds and has been paying that rate for nearly 7 years now.  In fact, when the Federal Reserve hinted that they might raise rates all of a 1/4 of a percent sometime this summer, the dollar shot up in value so fast that the Fed became terrified and had to walk their comments back.

This is just another article that totally ignores the reason why credit cards charge merchants 1% to 5% -- it's to provide consumer protections.  Bitcoin has no consumer protection and that's why it's free.
If Bitcoin provided the same consumer protections as credit cards, then Bitcoin would cost at least 1% to 5% to use too.  The reason no one uses Bitcoin to buy anything is because it is incredibly risky for a consumer to use bitcoin.
