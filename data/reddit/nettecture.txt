Even in poor countries 10k USD is not that much. It is that much as income, but most businesses deal with much larger amounts when they send money to suppliers. Computer shops, Camera shops, Supermarkets. It is not all profit, but the amount of capital running circles on a low margin makes 10k USD look like childs play pretty much in every major city in the world.

Actually not ervery time. Once all small payments move to LN, the idea is that the blocks are not all full anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:00:02
Exactly. And you have natural aggregators that will / may offer a LN node as service. Using a hardware wallet? Ledger uses a lot of backend servers for it's wallets - they can easily add a LN node there. Which immediately would have a LOT of users. Similar to every web wallet provider. Natural LN hubs.

Ah, but that is not what we are talking about? What is next? YOu tell me abou your breakfast to proove you are too dump to stick to the discussion?
The discussion was about 10k limits for structuring. Not about your personal lifestyle.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:21:33
It is ridiculous - but then this is the USA. There were cases of business owners paying in less than 10k a day repeatedly getting into trouble.
The problem? Well, that was their daily income - taking the cash, putting it into their account. Structuring? Well, what is the alternative? Keeping Cash? Adding some more?

Here is a fresh perspective. I know a forex trader that buys/sells in 50 million USD blocks. Try selling 50 million USD worth of BTC on any exchange with one market order - you crash the market.
For a global currency, the valuation must grow 100+ times to be able to handle the necessary trade volumes.

Problem is - most exchanges route their traffic through cloudflare, which acts as a global proxy service. It also costs performance.
You will ahve to contact the exchanges and negotiate a direct API access with them that BYPASSES cloudflare. Then they will also tell you where they are located.
With cloudflare you can only guess (measure latency from servers in europe and USA - see which has larger latency, slowly get closer to a region).
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:25:50

@_date: 2017-12-05 10:48:14
Well, not really. Big wallet is relative. This can be quite cheap - for example Kraken (or anyone else) could offer virtual machines EVEN IN THEIR DATA CENTER.
Wanna complain? Go home, crybabe. Colocation on exchanges is SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) on any regulated exchange. Wanna save - colocate in the same city. For chicago for example (CME) I get less than 1ms RTT without paying the ridiculous high fees. The data center I use has a dedicated optical fiber to the CME.
This is standard. People that are not willing to pay always get the cheap deal.

Flat out wrong. See, the reason for custodial services includes not trusting the ETF manager, hence having a separate authority. Which is tehy they are also used for other ETF and funds though theoreticlaly a broker can do that.
This is much the same like "not needing a notary to handle poperty purchases" - is it not about needing him, it is in most juristiction about him guarnateeing the deal goes forward in a proper manner.

First, why would they buy? it is like asking what Ebay is doing with all the stuff offered to them.
The CME group is an exchange. It does not need to buy anything. It connects buyers and sellers.
Second, if you would bother reading the contract spec then you would know it is (a) cash settled and (b) where the settlement reference price is taken from. And how it is calculated.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:40:43
How do you do that with:
* A position limit of 5000 BTC. Read the contract spec. You really do NOT want to break this.
* The fact that to sell it, someone needs to buy it? ;) And the market makers will rip you off. End of the day, your short will be accounted for (market to market) vs. the exchange reference price. Welcome to a BRUTAL loss.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:39:14
Idiot. Here is how futures work. For a contract to get into existence.
* One must buy.
* One must sell.
That means you always have the same number of contracts long and short in futures.

Actually no. You seem to be one of those "no clue about math" people.
Position limit is your limit of open contracts on the exchange. The market is irrelevant. If you are a whale and sell more than 5000 contracts you are in violation of the CME regulations.
Now, as one future is 5 bitcoin, the limit is 5000 bitcoin (sorry, my mistake).
Let me quote from 
To be exact:
    Spot Position Limits are set at 1,000 contracts. A position 
    accountability level of 5,000 contracts will be applied to positions 
    in single months outside the spot month and in all months 
    combined.  The reportable level will be 25 contracts.
Also, you have to report more than 25 open contracts.
And there is a lot of regulations around.
You said "someone can sell like nuts", so to say - no, he can not. You say you can make whatever promises you want - no. Some idiot may think so - but the CME is highly regulated. On top, there is regulation 575 (Disruptive Practices Prohibited) and people actually get fined for it.
See, here is the first difference. The CME is not some hungy bungy funny land exchange. It is REGULATED. And position limits are position limits on the CME - you can not bypass them because you are someone with no morals at all. They are part of your contract with the CME.
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:18:13
Segwit is not a split - without replay protection and meant as a replacement that is more like a "one of the chains will survive". Anyone thinking he gets double coins is IMHO delusional for Segwit.

@_date: 2017-11-20 16:05:23

@_date: 2017-11-01 09:25:12
See, to BUY a large number of bitcoins on a future date, he needs someone to sell them. Futures need both sides. This will drive the futures price up. At one point (difference X) he gets professional sellers. They BUY the REAL bitcoin at the exchange, sell him the futures bitcoin. So, his buying pressure slipped over into the real exchange. Upon settlement time, the prices will converge and the whole deal gets unwound (GS contract settles, arbitrage company sells the real bitcoin, pockets some small profit).
This is the main issue - people see "cash settled, no influence". The price can not deviate from the underlying real element too much otherwise arbitrage is possible and there is a whole bunch of companies doing just that (market makers). They have access to deep pockets and... well.
Here is the math (numbers example).
* Bitcoin Futures at 5200
* Bitcoin Cash (not BCC - I mean bitcoin on exchange) 5000
-&gt; 200 difference. If 200 is LARGEr than:
* Cost of buying and selling including possible slippage
* Cost of financing of 5000 + margin until futures expiration
-&gt; arbitrage possibility
This happens in all markets. Damn, people even buy Crude oil and store it against futures. Companies buy stock baskets to reflect the S&amp;P and then sell the S&amp;PO futures.
So, regardless which direction you "hammer" the bitcoin futures, the pressure will spill over to the "real" cash market. You can not move the futures market into one direction too much without getting this spilling effect.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:41:18
Which includes? Because I can not see wallets and exchanges not wanting to support it.
I know you need to move and that is a normal Tx, but wallets and exchanges have an intrinsic wish of faster transactions.
Or do miners actively avoid Segwit? I do not see that (all blocks have some)... so why is adoption not growing?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:37:04
That is faulty. Average never works in scenarios like that - you have to go by median or something like that.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:54:01
it is also settled every evening. And the price it is settled against is based on the exchange price of bitcoin exchanges.
On top, every futures seller needs a buyer. If I hold bitcoin (or am an arbitrage company) - easy game. Buy a future, sell a coin.
Manipulate the futures price down and you pay. Simple.
So, end of the day is payday and the shorts pay ;)
The prices are not detached as you think they are.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:41:01
Bet your ass, yes.
It depends on portfolio size. With a volatile market like this, this year most of my "income" (not realized) is actually the growth in crypto - mostly bitcoin (because that is close to 90% of my holding). Once you reach this - the attention moves from work to coin ;)

But again, this is irrelevant. Let me guess - you lack education and were grew up in a city, and only know wheat from the supermarket? Here is a hint: Wheat takes time to grow. There is no "more produced" within a short timeframe. There may be more planted next year, and this MAY result in a higher production next year (assuming there is no disaster) but most trading always happens in the "front month" futures contract and growing  more wheat next year does not really take pressure of the market in the next weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:02:57
Yes, which indicates the markets do not work efficiently yet. If you can do that manually, obviously, no professional arbitrage company does that automatically yet.

It has actually nothing to do with regulatory review and is exactly what testing applies- testing. So that you do not end up trading like Kraken does.

It is not only that. Because Exchanges ar FIAT ramps, Bitcoin will have to "start" and "end" there (i.e. people loading fiat, then shops selling some coin to pay for operations). As such, they are "native" LN nodes once LN adoption starts. Once LN2 starts (i.e. channel factories) they REALLY will shine as immediate points of filling up LN channels.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:21:23

Nice liberal bullshit.
Problem is: The moment you declare bankrupt, the CURRENT LAWS govern it. COuld MtGox have something different? Sure, keep customer funds and Coin SEGREGATED - legally. They did not. The moment they declared being bankrupt, the law is clear.
The BTC team is not the law. Like it? Who cares. Like it not? Why do you put funds in a company tha tdoes not follow a law you do not like (and btw., the SAME LAW is in place in every country I know - depbts are settled in Fiat).
What you demand - guess what: WHO CARES. In fact, your solution would open up a really big legal problem - people getting sued. But then, YOU do not care, right? Because "fact" is not as important as "feeling". You also do not care about the side effect and precedent - because you failed to be educated in logic. Changing the private key on a wallet via hard fork - what happens when your government starts forcing people to do that? You just inviolated the most important fact - the security of the whole cryptocurrency - for.... feeling.
Quoting George washington a little free - you neither deserve your legal rights, nor your cryptocurrency.
At the end, you put your feeelings over your common sense - mostly because you ahve feelings, but seem really to lack the capacity and training to think about the consequences of your  action.

A, full moron mode. Then I suggest you learn again. Maybe spend a month in rural India and just tell me WHERE they should get bank accounts. You are so typical SJW bullshit liberal idiot talk it is not even funny.
You should also tell that people that simply do not have governments they can trust. But then, you never lived in a country where the government told you that you can only take €60 out of the cash dispenser per day from now on and international transfers need government approval (as happened in greece) or where your inflkation rate is 50% monthly. Yes, would be nice to fix up those countries too - maybe your country should send troops, after all that worked so nicely in Afghanistan. Hint: not everyone has the luxury to live in a country with a sane government.
And get those people bank accounts - that attitude has hurt India brutally, when the government said "hey, no large money anymore, get bank accounts". Want to read up how that went. Because the world is not your delusional little brain - it is more complex.

You are too young to have money? Because here is what you SHOULD know, being an adult.
The guarantee from teh banks may mean loosing your money. Ask people in Cypres - they got a 70% loss during the financial crisis as forced buy in. Insurance covered the first 100k, the others where not insured and the government said "haircut".
Then ask the people in greece which during their financial crisis where only allowed to take VERY little money out of ATM's to cover their daily needs. Again the government - acutally enforced this.
So, "government bail in" - may or may not happen.
Now you think america is better? That is the country where the gold was confiscated - Executive Order 6102 in 1933. No joke. But legal precedent about what a government guarantee may mean.

Yeah, but I talk about BUBBLE. The one that would result in a hugh crash, people loosing a lot, "banks closing" (as was stated). What we had so far where what we call in germany "storms in water glasses" - yes, bubble, but not really a lot of people affected. The number of people with HUGH investments in Crypto is still very small.
I talk of a bubble where everyone on wall street will be "yeah, Crypto is going through the moon and higher". So far it really is waaaaay to early for a "real world impacting" bubble, so things will go waaaaaaaayyy higher.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:52:47
This is wrong. Exchange transfers likely are a large part of that - but even there between exchange transfers can go lightning. Heck, exchanges have no problem accepting money via Lightning and sending out from lightning, Lightning basically replacing the hot wallet. They are natural hubs.
Second, you DO have payment and "payout" activity. Faucets comes to my mind. Gambling.
Third, native Segwit does provide significant scalability, particularly one we get Schnorr on top.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:57:59
He will not.
You can deduct the donated amount from your taxable income (generally). This means you bouugh something for 1000 USD, sell it for 9000 - that is 9000 income to be taxed as long or short term capital gains, but you have then a 10000 donation to deduct, so effectively you claim 1000 more in taxable income loss than your bitcoin gain (but loose the original 1000).
All assuming it is an ACCEPTED charity. One with the paperwork. Otherwise it is likely a gift and you can gift what you want - but the 9000 profit have to be taxed.
Now, here is the crux: you can not survive on giving all your income away to charities, which makes it an idiotic tax avoidance strategy. THe moment you get something back, like "I donate you bitcoin, you donate me a car" - trust me, that is breaking apart the moment they look at what happened. No donation, barter, must tax at nominal value.

Agreed. This being a bubble? No way. It is a bubble when it is sky high and everyone tells you to get in, the hedge funds are in, the banks are in. We are not even starting. Well, we are - likely this year with LedgerX. Right now we are slowly moving into starting position.
This WILL bubble and it WILL blow up, but it has a LONG way to go until this is the epic bubble that will hurt institutions.

Gifting, Barter - no, tax is no written that dump. You gift with a counter gift -&gt; not a gift. You gift - there is a gift tax in many countries which you better pay if you have to.

Yes, there isa bubble coming. At some point when valuations are going to be idiotically high and everyone is thinking his bit money will make him rich. Term here is everyone.
We are WAY too early.
The mother off all bubbles may be when i t starts going vertical with a base of 100.000 or something like that and hits extreme high valuations.
NOT NOW.
Not in the next years.
Way too early these days. Enjoy the ride while people try to figure out whether they want on board.

No, there is not.
Once you have a lot of funds long BTC and the price goes down and they start selling you ALWAYS can have a panic.
Similar like you had in gold and other commodities.
That said, this is a LOOOONG time to go.

Yeah. Look up "risk" and take a basic lesson in risk management.
You CAN run that without hedging - most will not. As I said - either you are dump big risk and a speculator (not much different than high margin trading on Kraken, for example) or you have to hedge.

More particular, cashing out is selling large amounts of BTC for the purpose of keeping the value in some other store of value.
Selling BTC every 3 months to live 3 months -&gt; not cashing out. 3 months may be fore efficiency (not bother with it every month). SImilar to going to another country and changing currency for daily life.
Selling my BTC to retire from the USD / EUR or other amount that I get from that -&gt; cashing out.
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:32:12

Define speculating.
I mean, I have significant holdings. Mostly BTC, though I likely am in the top holding percent on other crypto too.
And I am speculating on retiring on that in a couple of years. But I am not trading. I think this will go brutally up.
I personally think everyone is speculating, but the degree varies and matters. Bt there is NO Reason to hold any crypto unless you think you are better of holding it than fiat.
And that they all misunderstood this nice fellow - he talked of teh mother of all bubblesd ON TOP of the valuation rise we see in the next years anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:34:22
Real as non trivial amounts, not as "is this money".
So far there is very little money involved in bitcoin. Order books are EXTREMELY thin. I know a guy trading forex and he works for a fund - standard trade size (which does NOT move the price) is 50 million USD equivalent. Try selling 50 million worth of bitcoin on an exchange as market order and see where this ends ;)
This wil lbe the beginning of a big push of professionalization for the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:42:45
Actually no. See, whoever sells you 1 BTC either has a hugh risk, or has to buy 1 BTC. if 10000 Futures are bought, someone has to hold the BTC or carry a monstrous risk. Which is what a lot of market makers will do.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:59:27
Yes and no. Remember, some exchanges have a higher price for the reason that their FIAT side is "problematic".
Zimbabwe, China at times... People in some places are willing to pay a premium. That said, a VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) may work.

@_date: 2017-10-15 09:50:15
Gratulations. One of the first people that actually posts something that makes me believe he has seen a mania style bubble before. All those "oh, it is too high" - no, it is not. Everyone says it is in a bubble, so per definition it is not. Plus, hardly anyone that matters owns any - so far it is not an asset that every fund "must have some".
Next year we will see the inflow of institutional capital. Then the thing will go up - brutally. It will tremendously overreact - no idea where, but anyone thinking it could go to a million... no, it can go a lot higher because noone wants to sell, then suddenly it goes down a little and next day starts crashing.
For the real bubble, we will need "everyone in". This will take a lot of time. You will need taxidrivers (plural - there always IS one that does trading or something in reality and justhas a bad streak so he drives taxi) telling you they really are crypto traders or investors, you need funds bousting about the high profit they made with crypto (that is funds, large - so far we have two small ones, and we have one fund manager that made a great trade in ether with his own money -&gt; this does not even show up on the radar as participation). You need everyone in, and then the bubble will burst.
And yes, saying something like "80% crash BACK TO $500k" is not unrealistic. We can talk about 200k, 500k or whatever flow - but that is the bubble we can expect. And yes, if an 80% drop puts the high at 2.5 million per coin - that is not unrealistic. Remember, in a real mania bubble - noone will want to sell, and noone cares about valuation. This means the price can go up into totally crazy territory. Until it crashes.
I personally have a long term BTC spending plan that goes into effect starting 2019. And I have "emergency spending points" above one million that basically say "drum X BTC there and diversify into 'hard' assets like land".
This will be INSANE. You have not seen anything. And you will likely not see anything like this.
I have missed the 87 crash, I have seen the lumber spike, I made a lot of money in the 2000 bubble (and lost a lot). Bitcoin will dwarf them all. This will be the delusion of a generation.
Now, I am NOT saying it is worthless, ponzi - there is real value here, and as you say, it will crash down to some high 6 digit figure. But the bubble will be the delusion of a whole generation, a once in 100 years thing. Let's all enjoy the ride.

This is not for people that want to hold Bitcoin - it is for people that want to invest in them. As part possibly of a larger program...
Look up "Commodity Trading Advisors" - first time we will see CTA and CPO (Commodity Pool Operators) being able to put money into this. Some of those pools are 100 million USD... and then we have arbitrage companies.
Yes, this is not holding Bitcoin - but it is still demand. The prospects are a significant market uptake. I would expect 10k before end of Q1, 25K end of 2018 as minimum.

The problem is that it has a very limited industrial application (as in: you need quite little of it) and while scarce, there are thousands of metric tons of it in vaults.

I know yo uare an idiot, but would you please put less energy putting that out to the rest of the world?
Let's see.... you refuse a 30 minute commute - which is amazingly short ofr most americans. YOu are ignorant about the reality of living in a suburb for most americans. And well - yeah.
Btw., Dachau is a nice place and I really had no problem getting to the city center at 3AM. To wahtever I wanted because outside of work, the occasional night out - always had nearly everything I needed close by. You do know how to ask people where to find a doctor, right? Oh, likely never learned that. Maybe you should add "by public transportation" - which you will find oh so plentyfull in the USA in general. But hey, common sense and you - never coming together.

@_date: 2017-10-15 16:12:04
Hate to tell you - it is merely a small over reaction. The general consensus for a correction is 20% down in a short time - but that assumes normal volatility. If you look at bitcoin volatility mathematically you will find that most of the corrections are not exactly unexpected. Purely mathematically.
The one counter example is the 2013 (IIRC) post MtGox - which does not qualify for a bubble for a simple reason: not everyone was bullish, most people did consider something to be odd and MtGox was actively manipualating the price. This is why I would not count it as "bitcoin had a bubble" element. For months people KNEW something was fishy.
A bubble is not only defined by price action, it is defined also by attitude.

You do not. Not if LN can be accessed by a fiat ramp like any broker. If I can send Fiat to Kraken, but bitcoin and have them sent it to my LN addresss - why do I need an onchain transaction to get the bitcoin?

2 factors:
* Routing, which is still being optimized, though it can handle quite some growth.
* Channel money. If you send a lot of money from a to b, a may run out of available channels. Routing CAN fix that to a degree, but as you need active routing for a complete payment, if payments go very one sided channels will just dry out. Part of the problem is lack right now of channel factories and.... the quite low amount of money even in larger nodes (which is wanted as this is still in trial).
@_date: 2017-10-06 09:25:13

There was one real bubble, that was the MTGOX fake - and it was fake (prices never got really paid). Before that - no real bubble. If you think bitcoin had a bubble, I suggest you start some historical real bubble examples.
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:31:54
But those are not realy transaciton limits.l I.e. once LN is adpcted, I would expect it to replace my hot wallet with ONE or very few channels to "official" major nodes. Official means things like companies that are well funded.
At that point I may refill it every couple of months, or not, depending how unbalancing it is. Actually not even. See, I would refill it most likely by buying bitcoins from fiat - which I would expect to be able to ahve them sent to my LN address. Imagine buying them on kraken (into your kraken portfolio), then ahve some of them sent to your LN address as spending funds.
This way I would not have ANY transaction to refill the LN address.

Ah, yes. It is part of the munich metropolitan area. Nice lttele town with all your need local (like food shops, doctors, cash dispenser, you know, the stuff you may need on a daily basis) and a decent connection to the center of Munich. See it like a suburb. Last time I lived in Munich I was actually stayiing within munich in a nice 50 or so square meter appartment for IIRC 800€ and had around half an hour communite to work. That was, though, around... hm.... 5 years or so ago. And it was month to month and furnished ;) So, extremely expensive. See, you love city center, your problem.

And you are an idiot.
See, I happen to own some appartments in berlin. In a prime area. I am not ABLE, letally, to charge more than 10€per square meter per month unless some VERY specific conditions apply. I would LOVe to take 1500USD for a 42 quare meter appartment. THis is your aberration for CHOOSING to love (a) in a city center in (b) in the most expensive city in Germany.
Munich is an aberration. For whatever reason the prices there are bordering insane. Ther are plenty of metropolitan areas in Germany (which happens to juts have a large number of cities) that are extremely cheaper.
Look at that list, down, Rent index.
ou willd fin that Munich, 44.78%, is significantly leading major other cities, INCLUDING Frankfurt, which is the financial capital of german.
Also, you miss the little reality that german cities are significantly smaller than the USA. Which means living outside the city is significantly easier. To be more exact, it is trivial to find an affordable place within the metropoltan public transportation area (something US does not even have) which covers pretty much all of S-Bahn - for Munich I would only remove the S8 high speed connection to the airport which just happens to be quite outside, but that IS a special case). Noone is talking about Freising.
You also seem to ginore little facts- but that is ok, uneducated and such. See, German cities generally are much smaller than american cities. Happen we actually build higher in most of the part. Outside of Downtown US cities tend t obe REALLY flat and not have 8 story appartment houses.  Here is a number (from  - LA density 2910/square kilometer. Munich - 4500/square kilometer. And average income is higher - so yes, bad new: earn more moeny or move out. Because this is much easier. Munich area is 310 square kilometer, Los Angeles 1302km. Move to Dachau ,Poing, Fürstenfeldbruck or anything else that is CLOSE in the publich transport network and has a train going in every 10 minutes.
You totally look at one number and - well, not sure where you got your education, but logic was not on it.
50 square meter, Perlach, 502€
52 square meter, Allach, 525€
Not to all non-germany: Perlach, Allach are not separate, tehy are districts. They belong to Munich.
YOU got a shitty price because YOU wanted to live right in the cityx center it seems of a city with a much higher price density. Well, guess waht - fools and their money soon be parted. Do not blaim others for your choices.

Generalyl the case is one of non logical thinking. People assume LN is for spending, and ignore the fact that Brokers and stuff like Localbitcoins could be used to get bitcoins into your LN address. Some people just dont see the obvious.

It is ok, I am the moron. Who funny enough never had a problem paying rent in Munich. ho also thinks that in LA you always move when you get a new job. But hey, that is fine.
And yeah, it is Taxi or Über if you are one of the few too stupid to do things locally and insisting on not having a car.
What about you move back to the USA because hey, it sounds like a much nicer place for people like you. I hear yo uwill have plenty of friends there that ALSO got a shitty education and can not pay for their livehood.

No, there is a limit in place in the software so people do not loose too much on a very early alpha. This can be removed if you compile your own node - other nodes will accept that.
it is simply a measurement in case a channel is lost ;)

Lucky you. I had them at times.
Once my bank got bought by another bank. Until I moved out (for about 3 months) - I had about a 50% failure rate for any transaction. It got so bad i carried significant cash with me for longer travels in order to be able to pay for running expenses (fuel, hotels) because I could NOT trust the card to work without interruptions that may last for hours.
Closed accounts with that bank then and moved to another one.

Yes. THE use case many people do not understand in the west where the answer often is "why do I need bitcoin, just open a bank account". Either this is not working (no banks easily around and accessible) or you simply can not trust them.
Even americans should be carefull - gold WAS once seized. But then, memories fade.
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:09:21
Exactly. I acutally think that we will end up with a tiered network anyway - certain companies will set up LN nodes that will be large by definition.
Exchanges come to my mind, Coinbase (juck, but reality is like this), Amazon maybe, if they ever get into crypto.
And those will be large, stable, trusted (i.e. offer automatic features like watchdog without the user setting things up etc.).
Most consumers will NOT run their own nodes. No need.
Right now it is geek time.

No idea. I can tell you I am upset about not investing another 100k when it was at 20 and I was buying my first coins.

Well said. Except Oil is not cash settled.  - CME has hugh storage facilities for oil.

A retail INVESTOR will not care. 1% is still ONLY 1% for something you buy and hold for a significant time (note: that is the definition of investor, compared to a trader). Not saying it is not nice - but a 1% fee will reduce your return around 1% (rounding here) - not really a large difference.
A retail Trader will also not care, unless he is VERY small - so pathetically small he should go and get a job. You alread get a 25% rebate (to 0.75) at  5 BTC, which is only 35000 USD rougly in turnover. Half for round trips - that is very little for even a small trading account.

Well, as long as they get utlmatiely paid from my bitcoin and are accepted - that is academical masturbation without practicel difference.
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:08:32
Reality? I love when people make stupif statements.


Trading and exchanging large amounts of money.




Which is pathetically small compared to the income you do not get in BTC. How do you move 5000, 10000, 20000 USD into BTC as saving with this approach? Hint: you do not. YOu need a seller.




So, being broke is your solution? First, that may not work too well - we still are not on a case where you can do that easily on Ebay (loose protection) and second - this is really a special case. "I am broke, selling my iphone for BTC". I dont think I have sold anything in the las 6 months - and still I had to get a significant amount of bitcoin as I move my savings into it. An exchange faclilitates this without a lot of problems - which for example localbitcoins has. It is muchj easier to keep an acocunt at an exchange, SEPA money there ,buy, then move the funds to a hardware wallet.
And people that work and need to move nontrivial amounts simply will not bother with the "how can I sell my household to get btc".

This does not suck, beause you basically do not trade at all. Yes, seriously. Your trading is mental masturbation - not trading for profit.
Let's get this straight. trading is not investing - trading is buying and selling. So, let's say you do 10 trades a month. 5 BTC is 35000. That is 0.25 BTC buy and sell (bcause 10 trades is 20 transactions) every time. That is VERY small. You will do more with a 5000USD account, and that is pathetically small to make some serious money trading. In order to be bothered you must trade so small, it is better not to trade but to work at McDonalds and get another 1000 USD to put into trading.
You basically complain about paying retail prices for buying individual bottles of coca cola in a shop.

Or exchanges. As long as bitcoin flow into an exchange, it will put them into cold storage. It will use new incoming bitcoin to pay out outgoing transfers. Which means as long as the bitcoin number in an exchange is growing, the number of cold coins grows.

Actually totally NOT like LN.
Most of the routing on the internet is not "dicovered" but "managed". Internet providers do not come and go like crazy and the number of AS is quite limited.

You are aware that Munich is BY FAR the most expensive part of whole germany? That is like taking New York prices as symptomatic for the rest. YOu can find significantly cheaper housing in Berlin, Hamburg, pretty much every single city in germany.
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:32:07
Acutally no.
See, on an international level there are no internal routes. Only the AS level is routed.

Really? Then you should go back to school - you failed both english and basic logic tests. The article says a lot - not that.
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:22:45
Then you are dump?
Your example is your responsibility. Making a bad example is your fault.
Also, while it may be condescending and hurt your snowflake feelings (buhaaaa) - it is TRUE. As I have shown, the volume you pretent to trade would be pathetically low even for a 5000 USD account in order to make a difference. One you actually trade - and do that with some real money - the differences disappear.
Condescending? MAKE UP BETTER NUMBERS AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OUTPUT. I find it insulting that you are insulted over your own stupidity.

You are right. THis is all that matters. If you want to feel good masturbating about the fact that you just made it. While living on the street because you can not pay for anything in your funny money.
Because without users you can not buy anything.

Actually in history it is 10% less.
It only averages out if the hash rate is constant, which is rare - normally the hashratre goes up all the time, so the block times are around 10% smaller. And yes, this includes the times the hashrate historically was falling - not exactly often.
