What a great time to start using bitcoin.
Just my luck I guess :)
Thank you for the explanation, that cleared up a lot of the stuff I was not getting.

Will segwit2x result in another seperate blochchain like BCC did?
Will I as a coinbase user have to do anything to benefit from it, or do I even need to worry about it?

I would like to give a big thank you to everyone who helped me clear things up, and to the bitcoin community as a whole! :)

I am quite concerened about this.
I like bitcoin very much and I want to support it as much as I can (running a full node 24/7 and what not).
But this change makes me as a newbie loose confidence in the stability of the whole thing.

Correct me if I am wrong: the SegWit2x change which will expand the current block size of 1MB to an astounding 2MB.
This change is not (yet) supported by the Core developers of Bitcoin.
If the Core Devs don't change their code to support the change, a great part of the network running their code will not be able to use the 2MB Blocks, thus creating a split in the chain?
So, the Full Node I am running at the moment (BTC Core) will not accept any 2MB Blocks unless an update is rolled out to support these blocks.
Also, I found this guy:

At the start of the week I put a good chunk of my savings into 75% BTC and 25% LTC
Going to get that 75$

I know.
it took me four days to transfer my BTC to EUR, because they kept cancelling my orders.
Customer Service never reacted.

i know this it has been a while but I get charged 2,50$ for a transaction over 2$.
