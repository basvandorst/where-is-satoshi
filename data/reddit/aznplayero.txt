I'm all for a stable 100 price point but why encourage others to buy on such an unstable day. Many out there are watching (most for the first time) and looking for guidance or tips. Why not sit there with your popcorn and enjoy the ride.

people keep using words like "correction" "normal" as if to down play all the market activity since March it's really starting to annoy me.

I have been buying/selling my BTCs there and my funds have never been put on hold. Honestly my experience has been very positive with bitfloor BOA deposits in mins and no issues.

"the growing demand for mining hardware" They are not going to ship anything till the last half of April which may have started today. Like I said you can wait or you can try elsewhere.

I'm not negative. I have positive hopes for bitcoin and its future. If you really wanted a time to buy it was this morning around 2am when the Europeans woke up and the price fell to 50.01. I would not take part in todays swings purely based on the market activity for the last 48 hrs. At this current rate you would be buying just above market avg which honestly is not the best deal you could have been part of.

In order to avoid panic we have been contacting clients in groups. Yes, we will be suspending operations. Please withdraw your BTC and USD.
Just got this response sadly this is true

Just saying the low was 50.01 not 49

Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.

How can the "Corrected" price only hold for less than 12 hours? Then change again it's no more accurate than the 100 price that held for 3 days.

Honestly I called them last week, they seem like a small operation. They have back to orders to last summer and are trying to meet the growing demand of new orders. You just need to wait. I mean you could go elsewhere for your hardware needs... good luck with that.
