Yes thought about that too, there are multiple solutions for that : payout after certain amount of blocks or use hashgraph like solutions since everybody is a miner everybody is competitive so this actually works now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:24:42
Agree btc has some more potential to move up again then ill dump it all lol and buy some more google stocks
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:05:06
Both are idiots lol. just look on cvedetails they have no clue what they are doing
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:42:36
Why is it taking so long? 50 smart guys could implement this on top of blockchain in a week.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:23:54
Other miners/full nodes?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:18:34
public addresses or didnt happen

Stop acting like programming is something magical software projects can be divided and that is how quality code is made ever heard about modular programming?
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:08:19
Because of the miners notice sometimes it suddenly drops a few 10000 transactions and then it is magically blocked again. Mining needs to be decentralized
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:46:24
This is why decentralized system dont work people are too stupid. you realise what happens when the 2 largest pools want to influence the system?
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:09:19
Please stop referring to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:31:31
1 Incease blocksize
2 make full nodes make "checkpoints" and delete all previous blockchain transactions
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:26:15
but... is it secure?
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:16:40
I only trust bitcoin core, when will they use segwit when is the update?
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:58:37
That makes sense now I understand
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:45:55
But how did they get this man inside a car?
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:22:27
Im not convinced by this since we can compromise wallets into signing transactions with invalid balance
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:42:44
I need to find out what those golddiggers spend their money on and invest in that. pizza?
@_date: 2018-05-08 09:00:34
I agree that the energy is needed to make it secure it seems like in the end it comes down to proof of money after all. However using different methods like proof of storage etc it seems like that money can be used for other than energy alone
@_date: 2018-05-20 03:15:07

It's a small world with a market cap of 100b you would expect some asian or arabiab billionaire to manipulate against them. Nope it seems above 1b everybode sleeps with eachother in the same bed, fags.

Lend bolivar invest in bitcoin = profit?
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:30:44
Most people bought at 20k that's how pump and dumps work, still i think bitcoin cant be stopped
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:57:52
U dont need 6 confirmations. Still 1 takes 10 mins that's why it will most likely be the currency of the internet and with future software hardware inprovements could replace all fiat
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:13:25
the 0 looking symbol is likely 0 because there are multiplications resulting in the 0 looking character. That makes the 1 looking character also 1 etc etc.

@_date: 2017-08-12 03:14:38
What's wrong with gold? I have both but gold seems to be more reliable than some wallet connected to some server to validate blocks like electrum.
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:21:49
I expect open source OS's like linux to be bullet proof for easy bitcoin usage. Same for banks software, hacker proof software is needed in this age.
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:47:41
How do you hold your btc? Cold storage seperate desktop? Be prepared

Jeez this periodic pump and dump is not the end of bitcoin, it can't be stopped.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:26:46
I dont care about bitcoin with my total investment i could pay a car's taxes for 3 months soon i can apply for welfare and ride a bmw for free.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:57:40
money \+ time \+ iq = money. or like warren buffet says "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." Which will usually be just a job to keep you of the streets

Depends if a country has whales they will be the new\secret rulers. Mostly technological advanced countries will be rich, the netherlands not being one of them.
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:06:21
I believe in economics people like knowing its circulating supply, if bitcoin was going to succeed of course this must be known for the money supply or if it was going to be used as gold the same.
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:19:45
HODL for life? lol 
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:43:12
