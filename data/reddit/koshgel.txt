This is real? I thought dogecoins were a joke.  Man, I'm behind.

Nice way to sum it up in one place.
Also seen altcoin tipping? How does that work?

Good to know.  I've had good experiences with bitbook as well.

Martingale is like a noob waving a flag in the gambling world.  It even says 49.5% win chance for 2x each bet.  You might win a couple but in the long run the house will win.
People try this same approach in blackjack and sportsbooks and end up losing thousands.  The house will always keep their edge of greater than 50%.

All I know is if I came upon 60 BTC, I would say fuck the tuition and hello to strippers and blow.

I tried tipping with the litecoins that I redeem from the bot but I guess the min is .01 in coins. Think I have to deposit

If you have more than 500 comment karma, you can message with the subject "Redeem Karma" and message "Redeem Karma" you will get a small amount of bitcoin based on your total karma amount. The amount varies, but is usually between $0.20 and $0.40. 
there is also a site, bitcoinget.com , sometimes they put up high value tasks and makes it easy to get a few mbtc
 is my favorite faucet aggregate site
