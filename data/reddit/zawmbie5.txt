Thanks, I actually did look at the FAQ and do some research before but I'm no expert and while I'm generally capable with computers cryptocurrencies are not an area of comfort for me. 
I wasn't comfortable with the knowledge I had secured on my own and with the FAQ that my money would be secure (except for BTC fluctuations). I came to the community for opinions on vendors I had looked into (Coinbase, and a few others) as well as seeing the consensus on what is best from a UX and security standpoint.
Thanks for helping keep a level discussion I appreciate the friendly help @_date: 2014-12-18 21:39:15
Thank you!!!

Great! Thank you so much

Ok thanks! I will look into them. I've heard of them before. So basically can I purchase a set amount and hold it there until I desire to sell with no other technical management?
@_date: 2014-12-18 06:56:30
This is a bit complicated for me (I know it's not that bad, but I'm worried I may mess something up along the way) is there not a way to purchase it through a brokerage, institution, or something of that sort to speculate on it as you would a currency?

Thank you for the helpful comment! I will give it a look!

As I already stated I'm very comfortable with my asset allocation and comfortable with the risk level. I don't need to go to I have already spent time there and am comfortable with my financial situation.
Bitcoin can be an investment, it is an inherently deflationary currency which means all equal if a valuation is relatively balanced it should increase in value because a lack of supply creation unlike other currencies.
I have done my homework and am comfortable losing 100% of my money on this, I have plenty of other investments, this is a part of a diversified strategy.
Thanks anyways

Just curious after you tip someone how do they receive it? And what do they do once they know where the bitcoins are?
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:14:15
WOW $2000 in a tip? That's freakin incredible! I only have $5 in bitcoins and can't really figure out how to use my wallet haha
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:35:26
Ok awesome thanks,
so how I think I PM'd withdraw but now have no idea, it just shows the bitcoin going in and out? Not to the wallet i created?
Sorry to bug ya, is there anywhere you know of i could read up on it?
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:27:20
Ahh makes me feel a little bit better about my bitwallet hhaha

What about a stable percentage of transaction like 1% or so? Given credit cards are 2.75% and PayPal also charged percentages couldn't this be implemented?
Given the volatility in exchange rates percentages could keep it stable.

Ahh yeah im not too knowledgable just thought about it
@_date: 2013-04-25 11:46:03
Ah but if you send one to me too i'll do what they do plus mow your law, for uh... "enhanced security vantage point"
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:49:45
