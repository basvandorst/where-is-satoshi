Wow Y'all are idiots... Do you really believe this BS? Let me guess, y'all barely made it to post secondary school, are probably sitting in front of your computers, trying to figure out how to be bigger than the successful kids you had in class, and instead of blaming yourselves, you blame the world...

What flags should I use... I ran into the memory issue.

Nothing. That's the point. However over printing would result in currency devaluation. Really bad over printing will result in hyperinflation. In the end, its the combined trust of the holders of this paper money that will determine the value.

I agree with almost all of what you said...except for 'zcash'...I would say 'Monero' is a better example of anonymity.

BTC, Monero, Ethereum and maybe Litecoin...The rest are all garbage... Just look at what happened to Namecoin...

After watching this I've come to the conclusion Monero is the way to go.

Let me take a stab at what your saying... if a block took 9 mins to solve we determine the hash rate based on what the probability of the hash rate was to find a block in 9 minutes at the current difficulty. So it’s not the actual hash rate. It’s what the most likely hash rate would be. Am I looking at this correctly?
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:03:52
So it’s more like calculating the most probable hash rate based on difficulty and last block solve time.
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:56:07
That doesn’t make sense. In theory I can solve a block by a single hash. The probability of it happening would be very or extremely unlikely but it’s definitely possible.

They turned off their Monero Miners, Unplugged them, and plugged in these new Miners... I guess they just dont have enough power receptacles.
