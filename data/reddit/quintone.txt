Ok and that’s fine, but your not an investor your buying currency that doesn’t exist, is banned in China and is facing reform in a lot of countries which is forcing it to be classified as a security destroying all the anonymity. Your the investor who thinks he’s smart because he listens to smart people say what they think about bitcoin. 
You obviously don’t understand why it’s overvalued

I understand how it works, It’s a good idea
Not A 7,000USD per unit good idea. 
I’m trying to get you to explain that yourself
Look at the volume of trades occurring and you’ll see it hasn’t increased which you need it to because it’s an accurate measure of market potential. 
Look just don’t invest anything more then 10% of your income or if you are count it as lost money because yes it is a good idea but not as good as it is valued currently.
No matter what it’s a risk and for a single income earner it becomes a risky investment since the loss potential and concurrent degradation in quality of life heavily outweighs potential profit. 
I’m just concerned people like you are putting all their eggs in a highly volatile basket. Stay safe

So then why is it worth this much because I guarantee you don’t look at any other market metrics. 
Also probably shouldn’t assume I don’t know what bitcoin is, Everton does your not smart or part of some group that knows something everyone else doesn’t.
Why do you think families are going to adopt bitcoins? They have no need for anonymity and are the biggest component of nearly all developed countries economies. 
Nothing you’ve said has been based off fact just that you know something no-one else does. 
No one in the market right now can explain its price and your saying you can and you know what it’s going to do in the future........
Maybe you should start an investment fund since your a genius

Nothing, nothing at all.  Also anyone at this point talking about why a crypto currency is a good investment is just to get more people to buy in. You can look at the volume of occurring and see that there is no significant rise in the past 1-2 years, however the past 1-2 years have seen immense growth in bitcoins price. 
either bitcoin is still working towards a fair value and in the process is returning 
growth and return on capital higher then any other industry. 
Or it’s overvalued. Where is the value coming from because it seems like it’s just peoples ideas of what it can do and not actual market mechanisms. 
I don’t care though ,
I don’t have any bitcoins just interested in markets. 
There’s a reason for everything and to explain the growth seen in bitcoin is hard and when you look at modern examples their aren’t many or any really that offer a platform of understanding. 
All and all no one knows what bitcoins going to do but the value definitely is not there at this current time, unless you say that the goodwill of everyone investing  is worth however much. 
Also I didn’t proof read this at all so rip grammar

no denial?

Your yet to explain this knowledge you have, I’m not going to explain how bitcoins work. All your saying is you know something others don’t, kinda like a conspiracy theory. You need to explain why, which as of yet you haven’t

Inflation isn’t a literal tax on savings it’s the growth in price of goods and services in the future comparative to today’s dollar, a market mechanism that I believe will always exist. 
Are you saying that you believe bitcoin will reach an appreciation rate above inflation? 
Because if that happened why would banks ever take on risky loans such as mortgages when you compare them to the safety of bitcoin, in this scenario of course. 
Also I can’t think of a single commodity or security that is a sure fire way to make money,
Also what happens when you have large groups of the population just storing their money for later the whole market would change if that sentiment took effect, I don’t even know what would happen to growth in that scenario

Haha I tried.  your not smart for knowing what a block chain is. Good luck 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:42:16
I dunno how the bubble will pop but it obviously will there hasn’t been any noticeable increase in the volume of bitcoins being traded for the past year which means it’s not being adopted at least not at a rate that corresponds with its price 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:54:29
Just read it, so what do you see the future of bitcoin being. Because I think that what you said is true but that bitcoin will only ever be as game-changing as its allowed to be both through consumer adoption and government approval. Do you think both people and governments will embrace bitcoin, and does it matter?
