The generation of people that don't trust the internet with their credit cards and need to call someone to open up the internet on their computer will not be in cryptocurrency. They probably still get an ATM or bank teller to update their transaction booklets. But that generation is dying off and being replaced by a generation that grew up with online banking, this is the group that will start the trend. By the time their kids are of age to get wallets they will be automatically generated and backed up by everyone, you'll get disposable wallets like paper wallets allover the places.
Right now the system can barely handle the users competent enough to use it, things will scale appropriately.

I've found a peaceful progression.
Buy Bitcoin.
Watch it soar.*
Buy some big altcoins, eth, LTC, etc.
Watch them stagnate.
Buy some shitcoin, icx, TRX, fun, Poe, etc.
Watch them drop.
Buy some ASIC mining gear.
Watch the ROI go from 2 months to 2 years.
Sit back and look at half the Bitcoin you started with, a whole pile of shitcoin and a pile of shit hardware.
Turn on internet for hopes of good news, see countries enforcing regulations and fees on cryptocurrency, turn off news and go back to whatever entertained you before you thought you were going to be a crypto millionaire this year.
**Results may vary.

Yeah, I think the problem is that whatever you do with it, the chips are designed for sha256, so you're solution has to involve using that algorithm. You can repurpose how it interacts with the world and files, but the physical hardware cannot be changed from running the sha256 algorithm.

The same thing that attracts small fish to crypto attracts big fish and bigger fish.
A deregulated currency means that anyone can exploit it anyway they can to make money. So the big fish that are used to making their secret pump and dumps get in because it's incredibly easy to setup with far fewer players. The bigger fish that are used to mass market manipulation and global price fixing so the same thing but with entire exchanges.
As they get better and better at it there will be a profit model carved out of crypto currency manipulation that will evolve as the code evolves.

If all of dust is in non-segwit wallets then even if they adopt segwit they still have to move the dust to segwit wallets and still have the transaction fee of that right? So unless transaction fees drop to almost nothing that dust is there to stay?

@_date: 2017-12-26 18:14:23
Agreed. I'm carrying Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, ethereum, and Litecoin all in the same wallet. Very convenient.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:17:21
Well to be fair I had no wealth in the game until BTC exploded.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:48:37
So several months ago, let's say three, you bought 50k of BTC, then it would have been about 2500/BTC. So you have 20btc. Two weeks ago you bought another 8? So you have 28 BTC, worth about 330k at today's depressed price.
So your saying your wife left you for making 130k in a couple months, not to mention what would probably be another 500k next year?
Better off without her. Except you sold all your coin too at a massive profitability, so I guess it's just you all alone on Christmas with piles of money?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:26
Also the bitmain antminers came in stock suddenly forcing everyone to buy BCH.

Hah me too, my wife freaks out about normal things, can't imagine the stress on her if she saw what Bitcoin did on a daily basis.
Now I'm going to see if she notices an antminer, and then three more...
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:03:48
My portfolio used to be 50/50 BTC/eth, having changed nothing my portfolio is now 98/2, to reduce risk are you saying I should transfer half my BTC into eth to balance it back out?

Unfortunately I think this will be the new norm for all.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:31:46
I'm still confused about what's going on. Are antminers using asicboost or is there some other ASIC out there that runs asicboost made by bitmain? Are miners running asicboost for this altcoin making BCH or BTC or some BCH alt? Do they make more money mining this altcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:24:52
So what you're saying is... To da moon?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:07:31
Is this why whattomine always has bcash ahead of bitcoin in terms of profitability? Mining bcash gives you a little extra bang for your buck? Or only antpool does this so mining with antpool gives you a little extra?
Also if this is true, you're probably never going to see coinbase implement segwit, aren't they in on it with CNBC and BTC and etc etc?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:00:58
They have filters for the smell lol. But yes, my neighbours might stop winking at me when I come out of my cave.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:49:40
What're people going to do? You'd have to modify the difficulty calculation frequency or something but then you have bigger swings. I'm sure in the future something will be tweaked to fix it, but for now Petahash mines can probably manipulate difficulty this way.

Yeah I saw a coin, Demz or something like that jumped up to 5800% profitable over BTC for a few hours this week. With a large enough mine you could really push altcoins around.

@_date: 2017-12-25 12:54:31

I wouldn't say better is the right word. 
Lucky early adopters that hodl aren't helping build Bitcoin value, early adopters that are selling would be helping as they are actually adding value to the system.
People that buy in at 10k, 25k etc and hodl are adding money to the system and building brand strength. Their moon stories won't come for years but they will come.

No I know what happened and why, I thought the interesting bit from the article is that the only bcash mention is that it's trading has been halted due to shady activity.
The only bcash take away is that something shady was going on and it is a spinoff.
The Bitcoin take away was that this dip and bounce happens a lot and that investors shouldn't fret.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:39:59
So won't these fake bitcoins just be the banks analog version of altcoins?

I think this is bcash overthrow attempt  Bcash just doubled and I saw BTC drop from 22k CAD to 16k CAD but then right back to 19.5k CAD, I think someone just dumped all their BTC for bcash.
Edit: and were back

@_date: 2017-12-09 02:21:46
Yeah I should have said switch coins every two weeks, not turn off.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:08:41
This bit is interesting:
On Thursday, a bitcoin spinoff called bitcoin cash was suspended from Coinbase after possible insider trading.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:05:23
It's a good idea that needs to be built into the protocol, like segwit, just needs time to make it standard. The whole currency is supposed to improve and evolve over time.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:41:31
Yeah this is pretty much exactly the conclusion I had come to. If they switch their massive mine back and forth between the two they would be manipulating the difficulty on both. And since they have been pushing bcash a lot lately this makes sense. I guess if we sync up to their movements we can also make a little extra.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:20:26

I think if you have 10,000 Bitcoin and you set progressive sell orders of 100 coins $1000 apart, you can move the price of Bitcoin. Or maybe it's 1000 coins $100 apart. Either way, the market buys or sells depending on what you're doing and you can move the price until you come up against another whale or sell wall.

If anything it feels further away than ever. It caught the attention of professional money traders/makers and now they are throwing every strategy and scheme and algorithm they can at it to bleed as much money out as possible.
It's deregulated and until someone can figure out how to prevent market manipulation without regulation I don't think it will spread like everyone thinks.
I'm not saying it won't happen, but some new technology will have to come along to prevent what is currently happening from happening until it's dead.
