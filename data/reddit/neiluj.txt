I'm talking about this app specifically, and why it's popular in the App Store. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:11:44
The only reason the game is popular is because people thought they could make real money off of it.
@_date: 2014-11-03 00:39:46
What's a great concept! Can't believe we haven't thought of this sooner. If we get the ball rolling maybe the price might even go up a bit.

Coinjar is the one I use. Great/simplistic UI and has optional extra security features, like a required MFA confirmation for transactions.

Everything you mention is true. I'm tired of hearing all these used car salesman types going on and on about how Bitcoin is a panacea to financial fraud and lack of transparency when in reality the price is so easily manipulated. Bitcoin is just as easily used as cash for nefarious purposes, folks. biTcOin gOoD bAnK bAd.

I've been working with Bitcoin and other crypto/financial systems for like 6 years. I've lost faith. Influx of shitcoins and seedy players have been the final nail in the coffin.

It's more of a frivolous generalization (much like this post) about crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:10:48
Oh for sure, blockchain technology has enormous potential. I'm not commenting about that. Bitcoin and the coins/tokens themselves, however, I find to be riddled with potential exploits. There is a limit to laissez-faire, which leads me to my next point of contention which is, since that is true, what makes Bitcoin and other coins different than traditional banking systems if it is inevitably going to become just as regulated, if not more so? I just don't see the point aside from mere ease of usage and the fact that a QR code takes up less space than a wad of cash. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:53:11
Quick, the price is down. Get the shitpost cannons ready.

Some sweet idealistic and hyperbolic telemarketing trash to offset Bitcoin's declining value. Yeah we get it, Bitcoin is cool and works reasonably well for what it is. Geez.
@_date: 2019-01-30 21:57:25
Have worked 3 crypto related jobs in the past, one of which was at a hedge fund. I'm quite familiar with the space actually, although I've completely lost faith. Shitcoins everywhere...tokenize this, tokenize that. Let me tokenize the paper I use to wipe my ass while we're at it. Greedy assholes everywhere  using Bitcoin as their pawns then evangelists acting like it's the panacea for all financial corruption. It's all a big mess and it gets old to hear people who are so ignorant to the reality of this Bitcoin craze. Only reason it peaked to $20k was because everybody and their uncle was buying in on the speculation of it being an untapped get rich quick scheme. Crypto's going to leave lots of stupid speculators and brilliant people alike in financial ruin with this retarded "hodl" movement.

Brilliant. Spend more money to go somewhere less convenient to potentially spend even more money in the long run. Can you be my financial planner?
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:13:13
You're talking nonsense by default. My observation of buying at $20k was a facetious one in order to be funny. Ha ha get it.
@_date: 2019-01-30 21:39:10
You must be one of those used car salesman types. Get your head out of your ass and make some real points about it's importance instead of this idealistic, meaningless fluff. biTcoIn iS gOoD beCauSe iTs goOd

OK I partially agree with you that I am not performing the calculations myself although it does require some technical knowledge in order to properly configure a miner to do what you want it to do. Its not like any average Joe is going to be able to configure a powerful miner within a matter of minutes, which is what it seems like to certain people.
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:35:23
Every time I tell somebody how I mine bitcoin, they always seem to think that it takes absolutely no skill whatsoever and all you have to do is plug a miner into the wall. I guess now I can just show them this and give them some perspective on what is actually going on.
