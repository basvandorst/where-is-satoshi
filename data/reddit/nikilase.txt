Just use their mobile website. It's basically the same
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:36:35
Wow that's cool. Although sad that it's only one store
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:12:30
It's because they disabled Euro/bcash buys until January. Go read their blog, it should be stated there. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:34:24
Wow. Didn't know Edeka accepts bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:36:24
Wow that would be kinda not too bad. I guess many here bought before 5k and would still see some gains. Obviously that kind of crash would still be crazy for most 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:48:54
I am German and have an account on gdax. Just make one on coinbase and login with your coinbase credentials
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:59:43
I'm also with VR and never had any issue. Sepas went through mostly within 1 business day. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:00:28
It clearly is a bear trap. Dont you see it on the chart? Couldn't be more obvious 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:33:56
Müsste eigentlich so sein. Kann demnächst auch Mal nen Steuerberater fragen aber so oft wie das hier gesagt wurde müsste es stimmen
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:43:27
Boah ist das cute. Da wird sich jemand ganzschön freuen. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:23:52
Nice but how come on gdax the max was about 50€ lower  at 9950€
@_date: 2018-08-31 22:36:50
Holy shit. Espresso for just one buck? I need this!! Also yeah bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:13:52
I put about a fifth of my money in cryptos. I'm a student so I don't have very much but it's much better than to just let it for in a bank. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:15:42
More like if the link isn't coinbase.com it's not legit. Who could fall for this except old grannies? The link is obviously not legit. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:52:24
More like 
1. High or drunk 
2. Just didn't get enough sleep 
He actually delivered many of his crazy ideas like the boring company or the flamethrower
Edit: formating on the phone sucks
@_date: 2018-05-13 09:51:59
Thanks. Yeah I hope that too. Good luck 
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:05:00
Don't you need ID to buy and sell anyways? Who would just want to use coinbase as a wallet? 
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:09:41
Would be way to much for me. I need some money on my debit card for grocery's and all the university expanses. But good luck with that :)
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:35:59
Only at 30 but still yeah. Go crypto retirement savings
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:34:09
That's what I'm trying to do. Put cash in it and get it out around Christmas. And I wouldn't ever put everything in crypto because I can't use it very much so I still need Fiat for almost everything
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:26:16
Is this a parody account? ����
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:32:33
Actually we are trying to save some money for when we are old and our pension can't even buy us a small apartment. So yeah basically saving for retirement. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 10:31:26
About 3500€. Of course I'm still in for the long run.
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:42:57
One thing is for sure though, you should not buy Madden 20
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:06:33
Wait for at least another 500$
@_date: 2019-02-15 12:49:20
Only works in the us right? :/
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:35:17
Gdax too. Maybe set it up to 5510€ or so. I think I'll do it too. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:22:37
If I remember correctly they said somewhere in the beginning of creating the account that you get 10$ for free if you buy for 100$. Or was it because I used a ref link? May also be the case. In that case, sorry.
Edit: Yeah sorry it was because of a ref link. If anyone wants to open an account you are free to pm for the ref link. 10$ free for both of us :D
@_date: 2019-06-02 10:34:29
As if they will leave the eu at that date. But that's not an issue for this sub
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:00:02
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:27:16
Well it hit 5500€ for the second time now an didn't go lower. It may (or may not!) be the lowest we can get.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:05:08
It wasn't suspended by everyone. It seems that very little people still wanted to split. That's actually just taking good care of customers during the fork
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:41:56
Depending on who you ask it is either another shitcoin or the next bitcoin. It forked from bitcoin and has a bigger blocksize and lower fees (and transaction times?) than bitcoin . Speculations are that the whole S2X thing was a planned attack to make more money with bitcoin cash but tbh. who knows... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:38:48
Don't know if shitpost or just plain stupid
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:05:52
oh no.. and i still couldn't sell this shitcoin from my coinbase account :/ guess it'll be worthless in january
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:41:00
just divide the 20 bucks by the per coin price of when you bought them and multiply that with the current price
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:54:51
Didn't really care for bitcash. Was like my first week in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:11:26
You really think banks are trustworthy? Look at how many times we had to safe them with our taxes. Not saying every bank is evil but the major banks often are. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:29:58
I dont know why you always complain about the long waiting times on coinbase. When I do a SEPA deposit it takes a maximum of 2 days. Most times the money arrives in less then 32 hours
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:57:38
Holding on gdax
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:35:33
The dollar has roughly a 50% share of global usage whereas the euro has roughly 30%. Meanwhile not even 5% of the global population uses imperial measures. Oh and conversion of usd to eur is only usd/1.2. Not even a big difference.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:04:57
Aaah good old Bitcoin Nazi. 
You draw him and he doesn't like it so.. No Bitcoin for you!
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:57:49
Buy another 100$ on coinbase to get your 10$ of free btc from them. Then make yourself comfortable with gdax, the sister(?) company of coinbase. Same login and basically the same company. From there on, better buy more than just two coffees worth of bitcoin. Oh and don't forget to HODL and have fun :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:59:24
Uhm... Canada?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:52:30
Sorry, I didn't mean you personally but rather this whole sub. Maybe it's an American thing to wait for so long to get the funds. At least from Germany I get my money really fast
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:27:13
Thought to myself "why not try day trading". Lets say I'll never try it again
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:17:20
Free electricity can also often be found if you are a student at a university. My dorms have electricity included. Too bad though I'm not wealthy enough to buy a 3000€ miner :/
@_date: 2019-02-17 10:43:47
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:01:27
Yeah just use gdax. It's the same company just with low fees for normal buying and no fees for limit orders. Coinbase is only for noobs. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:05:25
Will sell a little so that i get my losses back when it hits 7k€ but other than that just hodl
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:51:27
That fork happened 3 month ago. forks happen every now and then. We had 5 major forks, 4 of them this year and one in 2015.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:36:03
or for the rest of the world 1.6% of the 363105 km
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:17:26
Don't spread fake news. They even clearly stated that they think 2x's network won't be stable
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:05:17
Pretty interesting. Hope this turns out to be true 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:30:47
And I though the 10k for christmas were a crazy predicion 
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:21:18
Was about to comment the same :D
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:45:58
Just the bitcrash supporter, pump and dumper and the weak people who thought like OP
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:54:52
I'm not sure. At least with big exchanges like gdax this shouldn't happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:15:21
Both. They're the same company
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:53:30
He said he will do the video tommorow or so
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:23:19
Not in Europe (except maybe UK)
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:23:29
Not in Europe (except maybe UK)
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:18:16
Yeah I think we don't put the € in front of the amount like the US does. But fuck that's a huge number almost 3 billion euros. 
Edit: In Europe this number is actually billion not trillion. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:16:31
I'm 19 and over the last month put 600€ in Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:47:37
Sure sounds like a nice trip :) Definitely have to do this too
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:09:15
You can either use a passport, ID or drivers license. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:11:06
Crazy to see that almost every west European country has some sort of ATM except for Germany. Why don't we get them? Even Liechtenstein has one 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:18:31
Wow. Thanks for the info :D Gotta visit one next time I'm near. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:07:15
That's kinda shitty of them. Any correlation between this and what happened to wikileaks and that other business they dropped?
