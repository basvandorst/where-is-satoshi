The government might not be able to touch them unless it gets your keys, but if the government can prove you have access they can compel you to give up the assets and throw you in jail for contempt if you don't.
OP's fake story is stupid because institutional investors generally tend to be regulated by the government and they have to keep very accurate books of their holdings. They can't just hide some of their organization's assets in Bitcoin and hope nobody notices. And the fact that they need to document it means that the government has proof that the assets exist and can compel them to hand it over - especially if there's a case of fraud/embezzlement/etc.
In the case of something civil like a divorce or other judgement, you might not have to give up your key, but you'll still have to come up with the cash to buy some number of BTC and give them to the other party if you're instructed to.
TL;DR: The "they can't make you give up your key" argument is complete bullshit and reality will fuck you hard if you're ever in a position where someone actually does want your key and is willing to imprison you for it.

Because if you're an institutional investor then you need to keep meticulous records of your investments and the government could compel you to hand them and the assets over. This dude's argument is 100% not true.

They also DoS'd the Silk Road site because they knew he'd log in to fix it, proving that he had admin access.

An address isn't a wallet. You don't "connect your wallet" to mining hardware, you configure it with an address to send bitcoin to. Having control of a wallet implies that you can both receive AND send money from it...
In fact, a wallet is essentially just a private key. That's something you should NEVER share with anyone.
