Give me a break.  Being discriminated against because of the color of your skin is not remotely the same as being discriminated against because you would like to buy things with bitcoin.

You are only sort of correct.  Banks need to report anything over $10,000 at one time, or any group of smaller transactions that appear intentionally designed to avoid that reporting requirement (e.g. two $5000 transactions in a short time, or a $9999 transaction). However, there is nothing illegal about making a transaction over $10k.  The fact that the bank has to fill out a form and send it to the federal government is completely separate from whether they decide to close your account.  I'm guessing they are just being overly cautious because it is hard to predict how the government is going to act regarding bitcoin transactions, and yours was a pretty big amount of money.

Umm...this isn't an attempt to exert their hegemony, it's just the government doing what governments do; i.e, taxing.  It was crystal clear that bitcoins were taxable even before this IRS ruling - the only real clarification is that they are eligible for the reduced capital gains tax rate rather than ordinary income rates.  Whether you want to comply or not is your own business, but anyone who is at all surprised by this (non)development doesn't know enough about tax law to be posting about it.

I agree with all of your points, but especially the first two.  Bitcoin has potential to improve some aspects of banking a great deal, but people have to keep things in perspective.  Credit card and payment remitters fees being lowered by 2/3 does not equate to "I need to start stocking my underground bunker" survivalist talk about how the US economy will inevitably collapse, the only real money will be guns and bitcoin, and there will be a complete breakdown of civilization and social order.

The doc looks real to me, but I don't think your argument is that great evidence either way.  Specifically: the fact that Mt. Gox would include some farfetched or nonsensical reasoning in an attempt to persuade an investor to come in and save the day is not hard to believe. As an example, they argue in the doc that they can win back customer trust through new management and lower trading fees.  Umm...customers are not going to stick around with an exchange that just suddenly shut all trading for a month and admitted to a massive theft just because you offer them a 5% off coupon. But hey, that doesn't mean the doc isn't real -- just that Gox was all out of good options, and was throwing a last ditch hail mary pass.

"Major" law firm is a bit of a stretch.  A major law firm would not have engaged in what is effectively a publicity stunt like this.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for wider acceptance, and view this as good news for the bitcoin ecosystem, but I don't think a truly major law firm (i.e. top 100) would do something like that.

ugh give me a break.  Every other comment is about "price manipulation" and "whales."  Maybe that's true in SOME of the thinly traded scamcoins but you can't use that as a boogyman to explain every price dip.   It reminds me of how people obsessed with gold and silver have been spouting theories for a decade about how huge cartels are conspiring to keep the prices down, in order to explain the fact that prices weren't as high as they would like them to be.
The fact is, bitcoin prices are languishing because there have been more buyers than sellers.  I don't pretend to know all of the reasons why that is the case, but that doesn't mean that it is some super-secret cabal of "whales."  My guess is that some of the recent price dip is due to investor fatigue syndrome i-- i.e. people saw the december spike, and bought in during the beginning of 2014 with the expectation that they were surely going to double their money in ~ months.  After they realized that wasn't the case, they got fed up and pessimistic on bitcoin and a significant percent of them decided to just cash out.  Another possibility is that the price was just too inflated to begin with, and even good news can't compete with the natural movement back to rational price levels.  Full disclosure - I'm a bull and think the price is going to probably top 1500 this year, but even I do have some serious concerns and I'm sure some small development could spook me enough to bail out before the end of the year too.

1. OP's belief that it was closed because of bitcoin activity is basically sheer speculation.  No one at the bank even mentioned the word "bitcoin." It could be something totally unrelated.
2. I hate to seem like I'm defending a big bank because I know this will get downvoted, but it isn't like they stole his saving account- they just told him they didn't want his business.  It's an inconvenience to OP, perhaps, but it is still not illegal to refuse to do business with someone because you think they are exposing you to legal/compliance/regulatory risks (even if they are mistaken, or being unreasonably over-cautious).  If some bank wanted to refuse to open customer accounts for anyone who lived in the state of Delaware, or anyone who doesn't like the show Game of Thrones -- that would be dumb, but it's their prerogative.  And there are plenty of other banks and credit unions that don't care, so it is not really impairing anyone all that much.  Also, your comparison to east germany is obviously nonsensical.

I think you're overlooking a key point: the recipient of a transfer does not have to cash it out into fiat...ever.  They can just use it in-kind to pay for goods and services, or transfer it as bitcoin to others.  So basically,  the 7% fee (although exhorbitant) is only paid a single time.  Of course, this only works if bitcoin adoption is large enough that it becomes easy to spend bitcoin to make everyday payments like pay your rent, utilities, buy things from amazon.com, etc. 
If it remains necessary for every transfer to occur as Fiat --&gt;BTC --&gt;BTC --&gt;Fiat, then it is hard to see how it will involve lower transaction fees than standard fiat--&gt; fiat transfers.

it is not "scientifically unfeasible" to send a subpoena to coinbase or krakken that requests the name of every user and a list of their transactions.  Don't fool yourself-- if you use an exchange to buy bitcoin, it really isn't all that hard to track you down.

There are two serious (some would say fatal) issues.  
First, Under current parameters, oil revenues (~50-100B annually) are far too large to be channeled through bitcoin, since the value of all current bitcoin in the world is less than $1b.**    It would be like trying to use a drinking draw in place of a fire hose.
**Bitcoin market cap is often reported as around 6 billion, but the true "value" of bitcoin in the world is a far smaller figure, because 6B market cap figure is based only on the very few latest transactions, and assumes that all bitcoins could be sold for the current market equilibrium price of ~$500/each.  In reality, if even 1/10 of bitcoins were sold, the market price would plummet.  
Second, it would still be illegal, and bitcoin isn't going to evade government intervention.  If Iran tried to route its oil revenues through bitcoin transactions, the US would very quickly become aware of that plan, and freeze the btc.  At most, it would add a slightly inconvenience for the government, but it wouldn't be all that hard to stop.

Can someone explain what the allure of LocalBitCoins is?  Why not just buy them on Coinbase or some other exchange?  Is it because people don't want to wait the 3 days for an account to get authorized? or because they're paranoid about divulging their info to a website? 
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:16:55
He doesn't address the fact that most bitcoin owners get their btc from an exchange, and as long as that exchange can identify you, the government can to.  Sure, you can use local bitcoins, or mine your own, but each involves an added layer of hassle and expense.

Do you honestly believe this?  Because if so, you are in fantasyland.  Also "Only a 7 trillion cap" ? it is amazing that someone can say that with no irony.  I'm guessing you don't truly believe this because if you did, you would invest every cent you had into bitcoin, and then borrow some more in order to invest that.  I'm a bitcoin bull, and i would not be surprised if it goes above $2k this year. (I also wouldn't be totally shocked if it went below $100, but i think the chance of the former is more likely).  But $1m is truly delusional thinking.
One thing to keep in mind is that even though there is a hard cap of 21m bitcoins, there is no limit to the number of other altcurrencies that someone can create, and the only real benefit bitcoin has over any other is the confidence people have that it will continue to be accepted as valuable.  If the value did truly start to skyrocket to $10,000+, it would be on speculation alone, and not based on its actual utility -- since any other alt has just as much utility.

Who takes out £20 from an ATM?  Using £20 as the example is not particularly representative of the average transaction -- rather, it is the extreme example of a transaction with a huge percent fee, since ATMs charge a flat fee.  If you take out 100, you're paying more like 3%, not 10%

If you have 100+ coins lost in Gox, you should really think about legal action.  The company probably will go through bankruptcy proceedings, and any remaining assets will be distributed eventually to its creditors, which could include you.  It is definitely going to be less than 100 cents on the dollar, but it is also definitely possible that you will get something.  I don't want to get your hopes up - it could be close to nothing.  But I wouldn't simply write it off as a 100% loss just yet.  
If Karpeles truly ran off with 750k BTC, then he will be criminally prosecuted, money could be seized, and could be distributed to users.  Keep in mind - Gox could be "insolvent" if it has 10,000 BTC, but it owes 11,000. Insolvent doesn't mean destitute. 
My heart goes out to anyone who lost money in Gox.  It is the worst feeling in the world, and it just makes it worse that it was due to someone's wrongdoing.

"There is no doubt average American consumers stand to lose by transacting in Bitcoin. As of December 2013, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows 1.3% inflation, while a recent media report indicated Bitcoin CPI has 98% deflation. In other words, spending Bitcoin now will cost you many orders of wealth in the future. "
Translation: bitcoin is a better store of value than the dollar, because the dollar is losing 1.3% of its value annually.
"South Korea stated that it will not recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate currency." 
Who cares if it is legally considered a "currency" or not?  That is just a semantics game.  Gold and silver aren't "currencies," nor are money orders, frequent flyer points or Amex gift cards, but that doesn't mean they can't be used as a store of value and (for some) a medium of exchange.
