When gold is valued as a means of exchange, and not for the intrinsic chemical properties that gold has, it's value is just as unstable.

Dolly Parton once lost a Dolly Parton look-alike contest.

He also basically screwed his investors to the point where he couldn't get money from anyone.

People are betting hard against it.

It's a shame words don't have multiple meanings.

My goldfish won't shut up about it.

That's true of business in general.

Intentionally misrepresenting someone's argument, which is what was done.

He's a pseudo-intellectual when he steps out of his field which he does with a regularity that no self aware professional should be comfortable with.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:24:55
Why don't you do some research for yourself instead of looking to others to educate you?  I can promise you you can find a source for each of those claims.

He's pretty decent at psychology.  He should stay in his lane though because is pretty bad at everything else.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:44:02
Wow such smart.

Actual libel and frivolous lawsuits claiming libel are not the same thing.

Yes, and soldiers are ordered to kill people.  I don't have an issue with government officials being told how they should conduct themselves.  They are not private citizens, they voluntarily gave those rights up.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:15:22
Not just rhetoric but the rhetorical fallacies and bad faith debating he almost always falls back to when pressed about his ideas.  He absolutely loves to use unrelated facts to claim black and white arguments that he will then make an irrelevant conclusion about.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:31:58
That's exactly the situation for how he became famous in the first place.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:56:35
The Alt-right has deployed a group of win-at-all cost debaters that use rhetorical traps and fallacies so often I wonder if they've been coached by the same person.  The have such little interest in presenting good faith arguments they're not worth the time in trying.

Thats... so wrong I don't know where to start explaining it to you.
I'll start you off here, paragraph one wikipedia:


@_date: 2018-12-28 03:49:54
I think you need to look up the definition of evidence.  You don't seem to be using the same english that the rest of us are.  I'm going to give you the benifit of the doubt and assume it's not your first language.

Have you heard of dog-whistling?
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:02:51
He wasn't against compelled speech until it was about trans issues.  At least not in any significant way.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:21:12
Mandated by the state **for government officials**.  He could quit his job and say whatever he wanted without issue.  But he's a government employee.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:29:06
His psychology is good, just stay away from him when he gets off his area of expertise.
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:04:34
It sure is making him a lot of money in the past few years.  I mean tenured money is "good", but not Koch Brothers mouthpiece good.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:42:24
Yeah JP is totally going to disclose that he's being paid by the Koch brothers to dispute climate change.  He has many climate change lectures that are basically Koch propaganda verbatim.
Plus this:
You should really take a long hard look at some counter arguments to any non-psychology "positions" he takes.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:53:15
That's the rhetorical trap he uses to "win" arguments.  He says something that is categorically true then ambiguously applies it to an unrelated issue so you have to either make a negative assumption that he's going to pounce on or argue like a moron against something that's obviously true.  He doesn't "debate" in good faith.  He debates like someone trying to win a high school debate club.
