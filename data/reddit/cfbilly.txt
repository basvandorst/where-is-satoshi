Ground your pricing to the currency used to purchase inventory. Otherwise it'll be a huge mess when BTC fluctuates.
This isn't a customer right/wrong situation. The customer has a vested interest in your staying in business (whether they know it or not), and if you start having to deal with 10% and 20% price fluctuations while the price of inventory stays static, it'll be a disaster waiting to happen.

I have to admit: reading "My dad..." was cognitive noise and I had a snide comment to make about age etc. 
I reread the thread and determined how awesome this is. 
Then I thought more about my personal hangups about what I see as a bunch of kids in the BTC scene. (I'm 36) Then I realized that there was a time when I was a "kid" at the forefront of someone amazing, new, and world-changing (at that time, building websites). Then I realized that the major world shifts have always had the "kids" who were a bit crazy, risky, but ultimately embraced and understood things better than those around them. Which is to say that I think there's probably plenty of "kids" who may not have a clue, even when they have success, but so what - I still need to learn to check my bigotry and see all the perspectives.

Price has dropping for days for a number of reasons. Web site down time could affect it of course - it's all a perception thing. At another exchange that isn't under the scrutiny Mt. Gox is under, a simple web site issue probably would not have the same effect on price.
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:36:14
Gox has had issues dealing with volume before. If the site goes down at all due to people seeing this as the last lifeboat left on the Titanic, then it will hurt perception, and another dip will probably occur.
If Gox's announcement doesn't indicate that they've 100% percent fixed their problems, what effect will that have on the price?

You actually think Mt. Gox has any control over their fiat withdrawals?
As long as we're in make-believe fairy tale land, one of two situations:
1. Confidence is restored. Prices go up all over the place.
2. Mass exodus of fiat. No one's buying coins on Gox, but you can't get the coins out to sell elsewhere. Price plummets to under $100/BTC.

This is a pretty typical of this subreddit, where the assumption is that Bitcoin is as big in the real world as it is in here.

The most obvious answer: they feel money invested in a company that generates transaction fees from Bitcoin sales is more likely to return positive results than investing in the currency itself.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:26:15
Still there. Even if they shot up to 400, it changes nothing: fiat withdrawals still stuck, they still threw Bitcoin under the bus, they still changed their address to a virtual office, they still keep hiding behind press releases that say essentially nothing.
If the gains (hah, at 210 as I write this - nothing like losing 25% in 30 minutes to instill trust) are the result of insider trading or withdrawals, that's MORE reason to hate them. Nothing like taking care of yourself before your customers.

I personally don't believe them, but based on what they've said:
"At the beginning we will do so at a moderated pace and with new daily/
monthly limits in place to prevent any problems with the new system and to take 
into account current market conditions. "
The first few coins that get out will be sold at crazy profit. The market will drop to somewhere between the current price and the Gox price. It'll slowly come back up as more and more Gox BTC makes it out (I predict a large amount of customers will pull out)
If the market knows when Gox will open back up, you'll see the price retreat even before then.

Irony: Bitcoin is a disruptive technology, changing our old ideas about how we think about money. Yet we're expected to support Gox out of a sense of sentiment and loyalty? Let the market decide.

They have also been DDoSed, hacked, and more, bringing BTC prices with them. Even after this fix, you may not get access to your BTC for several days. If you're like most, I suspect you still have BTC there because it's hard to get your fiat out, and you've held on hoping that problem would magically fix itself and you'd be able to capitalize on the GoxBucks premium. Why anyone would tolerate that it a mystery.

No, that tells me the workaround (when I code a workaround for a client, I'll use that term interchangeably with "fix", since they only care about the effect, not the engineering) was already in place. Again, this isn't a scale thing.
What you're saying might be true if the flood on their servers due to the TX changing "hack" was minimal, given that low volume. I don't think this was why others shut down though; I think their code did not yet have the workaround in place.

Basically it's a 2-party system: the "Mooners" and the ??? ("Anti-Bankers"? "Haters"? a catchy title is a must ...)
As for the banking industry supporting politicians, I'd say they want to regulate Bitcoin enough to keep it at bay until they figure out how to get rich off of it. I'm pretty sure their motivations are driven by things far greater than the hopes and dreams of small time investors on a subreddit.

I don't think "store of wealth" means what you think it means. I think you're stuck on the word "wealth", but is has nothing to do with success or gains.
Every definition out there requires predictable value over a period of time. That means I should be able to stick my store of wealth in a closet, and 6 days, 6 months, or 6 years later, have a predictable amount. 
In other words, it needs to be dependable and boring.

When Barclays starts offering BTC credit options (there's no way BTC becomes an equivalent to fiat without credit entering into the picture), then a break-in is irrelevant to either. It's actually irrelevant now, if only for the fact that fiat is the basis for their funding; it needn't be however.

There wasn't the competition there is now years ago. The instant Gox opens up BTC withdrawals they'll melt with all the BTC being pulled out, with other exchanges trading at 2 1/2 X. Hello, by then, it'll probably be 3x, or maybe 4x. Personally, I think they're trying to hold out on reenabling BTC w/d until the price stabilizes (which may never happen).
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:51:46
They issued a press release, and didn't pull it, but updated the title. Probably due to legal reasons. But the fact that they're speaking as one suggests they know something. Otherwise they'd pull the entire release. After all, Gox tends to do something stupid every few months anyways - the other exchanges just ignore it or deal with their own issues; no joint statements. This is something different, something special. There's too much damn money at stake for them to release a statement like that because of random FUD.

High price now relative to a few months ago? Red herring. Hell, the price could drop another $300 and we'd still be double a year ago, so what? 
Compare price to when Gox announced they were closing BTC w/d. Millions of dollars in value destroyed in a few days.
Until recently, price at Gox was higher, due to massive fiat withdrawals. This actually destroyed value - if I put $1000 in Gox, I have no way of getting that fiat out. I'd have to buy BTC, withdraw BTC, and convert to fiat elsewhere, and lose 10% or so. Value lost. (This is due to funds being seized, not really their fault, but still makes them a horrible place to buy BTC)
I'd encourage you to review charts when they experienced DDoS and hack. Massive losses in the market. When they couldn't respond during the April meltdown: massive losses due to inability to exit market. Each time, value destroyed.
I can't see any reason to have a position in Gox other than someone beating the "Don't hate!" drum.

I think most know that a large number of those trapped in Gox were there because of greed. For several months, Goxcoins traded for at least $100USD higher, due to fiat backlog. I believe folks held out hope that they'd be able to realize those gains, even though they weren't real. Anyone in Gox before the Bitcoin withdrawal freeze could have gotten out.

A website of that quality will cost at least a few tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's not a weekend Rails project.
They had a seed round of $600K, which included connections (Alex O, Paul Graham, etc).
That $30M is certainly after the fact, but it's a marketing war chest. The idea is building a competitor due to what some see as issues with Coinbase. You're not going to do that with hopes, dreams, and upvotes.

The stupidity of speculators is a two-way street. Those fees are what keep every exchange in business. 
If I want to hold my position for five minutes or five months, that's my business (and my risk). However, if the exchange I put my money into isn't available when I want it, that's their failure, regardless of what comes later. 


The price. Nothing but the price. If their action resulted in the market freaking out, they've failed as an exchange.
If Wells Fargo or the IRS stopped giving people their deposits/refunds, it'd result in Congressional hearings. If Gox can't deliver, it's "Don't worry your pretty little head - see, it all works out if you wait long enough!"


So lack of theft is the standard for declaring an exchange a success? 
I'll say Gox has been resilient where others couldn't hold up. However, if they can't deliver, the market should vote. If they fail, so be it, regardless of what they've done in the past. Any other attitude is essentially a mirror of the fiat banking system.

Which price? I don't know that it'll get back so high, but I suspect Gox will be extremely low (over 1/3 less than Bitstamp at this point) if it even survives.
I also suspect that the decline hasn't stopped. At the least we'll see downward pressure until Gox opens up BTC withdrawals again.
If what some believe is true, that something bigger is brewing at Gox, you're probably best to just close your eyes to BTC price for about six months.

Folks have probably been hanging on thinking the fiat withdrawal issue would be resolved. As more time goes by, the confidence in this gets smaller, and you see more BTC being pulled out. Transactions take place, but most of them are just on the books as far as fiat balances go. Even whales eventually want their assets to be liquid. BTC was the one way out, for those willing to take the hit on another exchange. If the wallets dry up, eventually Mt. Gox will implode (or better analogy, tip over, as BTC exits, and fiat doesn't, so you see an order book for more BTC than is in their hot + cold wallets)

Even if this fix goes perfect, I'm sure once they turn on BTC withdrawals, it'll be chaos. Virtually no fiat withdrawals going on, a week without BTC withdrawals, a plummeting price: there will be plenty of people who have had enough. Even those who are patient will have a spectacular profit opportunity: as it stands now, Bitstamp is 60% higher. The price difference shouldn't last long; it'll be a mad rush. Can the other exchanges stay up? Can Gox stay up? If Gox experiences downtime after everything that's happened , that'd be pretty bad.

Just because everyone agrees that doesn't make it a circle-jerk.

This isn't 2011. They're not the only game in town. They're not even the best game in town.

Let's not even mention that Bitcoin's source is hosted by Github, a US corporation. And why does the majority of BTC value discussions refer to its value in USD?
When the US "seized" $5M from Gox, that was the beginning of the end, when you started to see Gox make it nearly impossible to withdraw fiat (usually USD).

That's assuming $2 in fees. The article doesn't say the Bitcoin ATM does $10,000/day in fees: it says $10,000 a day in transactions. The page you referenced said the average transaction was $60, so that's about $54,000/machine/mo. Plus it's an average: I'm sure a big city bank does far more transactions than a country town convenience store - given the high profile nature of a Bitcoin ATM, and the extreme scarcity of them, I think a high volume machine makes for a more apt comparison.

You're probably right regarding 6 days, but the point is that it should have some stability over any period of time. 40% loss in 2 months is pretty much the polar opposite. (That's the stable exchanges, I'm not even looking at Gox) The fact that it's gained in the last year isn't the point. A couple of bad news announcements and it'll be flat (or worse) come April. A person putting $10,000 in today needs it to be worth at least $10,000 a year from now for it to be store of wealth. Is there a potential for that $10,000 to be worth $100,000 or more? Sure. Is there a potential for that $10,000 to turn into $1000? Of course - you'd have to turn a blind eye to the past to say otherwise.

Gox still has glacier speed fiat w/d. Russia is still very negative towards BTC. The gravy train that took BTC to 1000, China, is pretty much dried up. 
Once this fix is in place, and Gox presumably turns BTC W/D back on, there will be so many BTC W/Ds, it's going to implode. (Technically, from a USD perspective at least, nothing's coming out, so it's pretty much a black hole at this time)

Gox will eventually die. The fiat withdrawal situation will not change anytime soon. When they open up BTC withdrawals, it'll be pretty spectacular how fast people start pulling their BTC out, especially if the current $120+ premium on other exchanges hold. No, it's not very nice to compare a tragedy where real life was lost to an incompetent business failing, but Gox will buckle under its own weight, it will go dark, it will sink.

Where do you get this from? 
Look at today's volume: 22,554 BTC. At current prices, at their max commission level (0.6%), that's just under $500,000 USD/mo. That's their highest commission level (goes down on volume and other factors), and BTC is at a high it hasn't been for almost 3 months. Most days the volume is under 20K, with a few exceptions. But let's assume $500K per month. That $2.9M is 6 months of income! That's assuming they don't have any employees to pay or infrastructure costs, which could easily eat up $50-100K/ month.
I suspect you have a large position on Mt. Gox, and you're telling yourself the $2.9 is "nothing for gox", but the numbers tell me a much different story.

Read my original letter. My point was that launching new products under preorder when they can't even guarantee delivery of old orders is fraud. You acknowledged that new orders may contribute to capital needed to fulfill old orders, which is fraud at worst, or capital management incompetence at the very least. This being a policy strictly in violation of PayPal's preorder policies. You seem stuck on the Ponzi argument, but that's just one point I made. I suspect the overall profile of the company's business practices will be a determining factor for Dwolla, or Stripe, or whoever BFL uses to process payments.

Yeah, I meant "Bitcoins available for sell". Which has the same effect, not for the intrinsic value of BTC, but for the secondary market.
I was talking liquidity at the macro level. My individual BTCs are liquid because there's a ton of buyers on the other side. Could any level of purchase and hold dry up that market to the point where liquidity goes away? 
There will always be BTC; people who plan to hold for 10 years, Satoshi, etc. However, I think of it like a living cell that can withstand low temperatures: there's a point where all metabolic activity ceases, even if the physical cell itself remains. Or the sun: it burns hot as long as the nuclear reaction continues, but there's a critical point where if there's not enough reactions that it stops (grossly oversimplifying here, so please astrophysicists in the subreddit grant me a bit of license here)

Have you researched the lawmaker, or just passing on an article that says what you want. Research the lawmaker (Mikhail Degtyarev). He's young for politicians (32); he's trying to make a name for himself by excising US influence. He has a staunch anti-gay policy, something which has received a ton of attention in Russia in recent years. He recently failed in gaining the Moscow mayor seat.
Plenty of other lawmakers are opposed to his plan, or the idea of the USD failure:
The same article talks about the demand for foreign currency in Russia is INCREASING. So some random lawmaker is proposing a law that no one wants. 
Read up on his political party, LPDR. They're extremely pro-Russian, aiming for a great Russia. They're goal is for the greatness of the ruble. An anonymous cryptocurrency that undermines the national currency? Probably not something they'd support.

2) BTC isn't the death of the credit card industry, anymore than it's the death of the automotive industry. CC companies sell time: pay later in exchange for some profit. No reason underlying payments can't be BTC based (as a matter of fact, BTC probably means more profitable payment models for CC companies - yay capitalism, right?)

"Bitcoin is dead" is about as dumb as saying, "Save the planet!" Earth isn't going anywhere; life as we currently know, it however, can change. 
Bitcoin is a revolution not because it makes anyone rich. It's going nowhere. Fiat value of BTC, on the other hand, may be diminishing, and it may or may not return. That's irrelevant. Bitcoin is designed to change the balance of financial power, not make people rich.

No one should get a free pass just because it might hurt the fragile little Bitcoin name. Quite the opposite: there should be zero tolerance. Bitcoin is all about the long game; this requires long term credibility. Weeding out companies like BFL is critical, even if that has a short-term effect.

NASDAQ: 42 years
Mt. Gox: BTC trading for what, 3 years?
NASDAQ: avg daily volume of 1.7B
Mt. Gox: largest ever was about 500,000 - 20-50K/day is typical
NASDAQ processes more volume in an hour than Mt. Gox has processed in its entire lifetime. So the multiple downtime events, security breaches, lawsuits, and lack of communication with customers for the  BTC exchange does make it look like a joke. Even if it meant the value of BTC went to $0.25USD as a result, Bitcoin's long-term future is far more promising if Mt. Gox collapsed tomorrow.

So is it a currency or a commodity for speculation? I'd say that long-term it needs to be a currency. I have a client interested in implemented Bitcoin payments, but the swing in prices is quite scary. The idea of clients paying an invoice in BTC and it changing value by 20 or 30% is no way to run a business. Imagine getting your paycheck, and not making it to the bank the next morning, and the bank giving you $100 less than you thought.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:50:24
Sure, post that graph. Just remember it took 7 months for it to regain its value, not the 2 weeks your hoping for.


Do you think it climbed to over $1000 by itself? The growth in China fueled it. Otherwise we'd be sitting around $200-300 (which while I think it's unlikely, I wouldn't be surprised by come 1/1/2014)

The other side of the coin (okay, that was bad): nothing had really changed from $30/BTC to $250/BTC. The rise was purely emotional, and is the fall.
At current rates ($64 on BTC-e), it's about where it was a month ago. So month over month, nothing of value has been lost. Stable price month-over-month, and the BTC itself still has value. (You still have the same number of BTCs)

As long as people continue to buy in to the lie, then it does its job as a medium of exchange. Will it come crashing down at some point? Perhaps. Over the short-mid term, it'll hold its value (value as a medium of exchange, which is all that really matters). Compared to BTC, the monopoly money that is the USD is far more stable. 
When it all comes crashing down, I'm pretty serious BTC won't immediately save the day.

No, it paints SR in a positive light, which you support. That doesn't make it a good piece. As far as journalism goes, it really isn't that good.
"Google keywords" How is this relevant for tor sites?
It presupposes that all the members of the "evil industry", with all of their guns and disregard for the law, would just sit down and let their $ fade away as the brilliant geeks did a right thing. No, if SR was as disruptive as the article suggests, DPR would eventually have died a pretty horrible death.
Where do SR sellers get inventory? They aren't mining drugs with ASICs. How can you guarantee purity, as has been suggested? All of the evil that drives the production of drugs still occurs whether the final distribution occurs in the hood or on eBay.
If I'm a dealer selling to low-income customers that always pay in cash, SR disrupts nothing. 
The article never mentioned the accusations of murder-for-hire. If those are true, then DPR was pretty much turning into the kind of criminal the article claims as "evil".
Whether the SR bust is good or bad for freedom is an entirely different question. As for the article being "excellent", absolutely not. It failed miserably at its premise that SR was disrupting an evil industry.

They take Dwolla. I sent the following email to support (the address listed on the site to use for fraudulent behavior). Feel free to copy, improve, and use:
I came across a page that is using your service to process payments, that at the very least may be violating your terms of service, and is very likely a willful act of fraud.
Please see  Butterfly Labs is offering hosting Bitcoin mining as a service. While technically a service, and not the sale of Bitcoins, I believe this weak distinction at best, and violates the spirit of your terms. As I understand it, your Terms of Service at  prohibits the sale of Bitcoins without special permission:
"Act as a marketplace and/or exchange for virtual currency products without Dwolla's prior written consent, and FinCEN registration if applicable;"
Another concern I'd like for Dwolla to take a look at is the statement, "All sales are final." The following term of service seems contradictory to this:
"You understand that We do not warrant the transactions and that these transactions are subject to ACH chargeback processes. You agree and warrant that any chargebacks received by Us can and will be debited from Your Dwolla account..."
More importantly is this clause in your Terms of Service:
"Defraud Us or other Dwolla Users in any way."
Butterfly Labs has a long history of making promises and then failing to follow through. Every product they have ever produced has been offered under a strict pre-order offer. They offer no guarantee as to availability date, and claim all sales to be final, refusing requested refunds. As a matter of fact, BFL frequently launches new products, under pre-order of course, before existing orders have shipped. These timelines are excessively long, oftentimes resulting in a product that doesn't ship for over a year after the original order. This for a product that BFL promises in weeks or a few months, and that is time-sensitive, as the value of the product reduces over time. 
You'll see that PayPal, a common payment option, isn't offered. This is due to to a grassroots effort among unsatisfied BFL customers with PayPal issuing over $300,000 in refunds in the past week. There is a lot of information about this online;  is a good starting point.
I cannot predict the future, but I suspect in the future, many unhappy BFL preorder customers will similarly be contacting Dwolla for refunds.
I'd encourage you to consider whether Butterfly Labs has a high risk profile, and whether being associated with this type of company is damaging to Dwolla's reputation.

If the company is legit, then whether they take PayPal, Dwolla, BTC, or any other currency is only relevant for future orders. Existing customers have already paid for their product, and their ability to fulfill orders is purely the result of supply chain, correct? 
The only way I the "white knight" could influence that is if they're operating as a Ponzi scheme, and have already spent the funds you sent them. Then they need those funds from future orders to produce your product. Which makes them liars, and scammers, and yes, something I hate. 
If the second is true, then Dwolla would eventually pull the plug anyways. Whether my "vigilante super-hero" efforts cause it now, or later, BFL will eventually hit a point where the cash stops flowing. At that point, the queue will stop moving, and Josh I'm sure will have a great explanation.

According to The Genesis Block, based on assumptions about power usage, cost, and rate of difficulty increase, the most one could pay and not lose money would be about $815 total (including shipping and any associated costs other than electricity). That's break even. Obviously this assumes current exchange rates.

This isn't the entire market, it's Mt. Gox. In 2011, the two were pretty much the same, but the market share is different in 2013, and you have to adjust for Mt. Gox's artificially inflated price. The conclusion would still be the same, but the slope would be shaped differently if we accurately account for impact of other exchanges + Gox's different liquidity.

Even at the crazy times, it wasn't that much money. April 12: about $360,000 would have been their maximum. Without running the numbers, I'd say they average no more than $25,000-50,000/day, ballparking the charts. 
Don't discount infrastructure. You'll recall their DDoS's they dealt with: shortly after they contracted with Prolexic. That means they're spending tens of thousands/mo for basic connectivity, and during a DDoS event, tens of thousands per event. This says nothing of the developers and systems engineers they have on staff, which are probably in the $7500-15,000/mo range each. 
Even if frozen, $2.9 M is painful to have locked away. I'd venture to say that's 2-6 months of income, which would hurt anyone.

Indeed. There was a madness going on then about how everything was totally different; the old ideas about how the world worked were totally changing! (sound familiar?)

No, I'm not a BFL customer. I've GPU mined in the past, but not presently. I considered buying, but it didn't feel right. 
So if I'm not a customer, I need to STFU.. that seems your gist. That doesn't stop people from being anti-Apple, or anti-Microsoft, or anti-WalMart, or whatever. So if you've never bought a product from a company that you're complaining about, or call for action against (which I actually never advocated), then you need to STFU. Got it.
I apologize if I somehow hit a sensitive spot. I realize that every time there's a difficulty increase, $BTC goes up, they can feel BFL shove it in a little further. Again, I actually never advocated anything, despite your insistence that I did. I just presented my email, and presented the response I received. I said anyone who wanted was more than welcome to use the email. Nothing more, nothing less.

What if your bank told you they were robbed and could only give you less than half of what you gave them?
The idea that these wallets or exchanges are operating without some form of insurance (which we know they couldn't get) or self-insurance (meaning they have fiat/BTC of their own on hand) is crazy.

Indeed. BTC has a total market cap of $1.5B USD. If it was a stock, it doesn't even break into the Fortune 500. As a currency, it's not even a rounding error in daily currency exchange, where about $1T USD a day takes place.

No, it paints SR in a positive light, which you support. That doesn't make it a good piece. As far as journalism goes, it really isn't that good.
"Google keywords" How is this relevant for tor sites?
It presupposes that all the members of the "evil industry", with all of their guns and disregard for the law, would just sit down and let their $ fade away as the brilliant geeks did a right thing. No, if SR was as disruptive as the article suggests, DPR would eventually have died a pretty horrible death.
Where do SR sellers get inventory? They aren't mining drugs with ASICs. How can you guarantee purity, as has been suggested? All of the evil that drives the production of drugs still occurs whether the final distribution occurs in the hood or on eBay.
If I'm a dealer selling to low-income customers that always pay in cash, SR disrupts nothing.
The article never mentioned the accusations of murder-for-hire. If those are true, then DPR was pretty much turning into the kind of criminal the article claims as "evil".
Whether the SR bust is good or bad for freedom is an entirely different question. As for the article being "excellent", absolutely not. It failed miserably at its premise that SR was disrupting an evil industry.

My position would be for miners to buy the hell out of hardware, just not from BFL. 
I know the disclaimer BFL puts on their products. Nothing new from them:
1. make promises
2. take preorders to supposedly fund manufacturing
3. make excuses why it's taking so long
4. leak out enough product to convince the marketplace that they're shipping, and rest of the order are just around the corner
5. fight refunds
6. start at  with new product, before old products have shipped, and promise this time it'll be different
Consumers don't need protection from a company who continues to fail to meet its promises, especially when there's plenty of alternatives.

Put the same money in bonds. Or Apple stocks. Or invest in small business. Or buy Bitcoin. None of these has a guaranteed return, and you can easily lose far more than 1%.

Keep in mind that when Mt. Gox hit those levels before, it was before the fiat illiquidity premium, so Mt. Gox's really isn't a good point of comparison.

Many categories on eBay are added once volume becomes big enough (after all, there were no mp3 players category on eBay once either). This could mean they'll allow BTC sales, and tighten conditions under which buyers can ask for refunds (so long as sellers follow certain rules, such as number of confirmations). 
This provides a logical conclusion about why they posted the video they did, and eliminates "OMG they're gonna let you pay with BTC!!!" as they most obvious conclusion.
If they made BTC "purchases" safe and easy and fast it could really damage the BTC exchange market with its onerous deposit and withdrawal mechanisms. (Though the 9% fee would be a HUGE deterrent, but plenty of folks are taking a similar hit when they pull out of Mt. Gox these days)
