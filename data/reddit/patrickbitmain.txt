They are also going to place an upper limit of 1 million dollars on any type of ICO, gofundme or Kickstarter style crowdfunding. Teams won’t be able to sell out securities in the first year and must prove bonafide product, not speculation, otherwise they will have to refund investors or face jail.

Of course it will crash. All the way down to about $200. That low price would probably reflect the real value of it based on illicit purchases and a very tiny bit of legal uses.

You are only slightly on track.
Parts of the US government, not just the current administration, don’t want to see US retail investors getting scammed like they did with the Reverse Merger scandal. That has been made clear in some press releases from the SEC and CFTC a few months ago.
They know that Chinese companies still don’t report their financials or do audits properly. They know there is a lot of system risk there and that the Chinese government aids it.
This includes all the crypto scams that are coming out of the Far East.
So as part of the trade negotiations going on right now the US government wants China to play fair and that also means killing crypto speculation and unregulated tokens.
We could go into more detail about this but considering everything this sub covers regularly I think we all know what is going on.
Trump doesn’t get credit for this. It’s the regulators and institutions as a whole who want to eliminate these risks. All risks.

It's not going to pass, bro. You just sound desperate. If they passed it there would be hell to pay, more short positions, more centralized ownership of tokens, and a lot of arguments every day. The smart money is in silicon chips, lithium, cobalt, etc
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:53:17
Nice scam site, brah.
Comparing to hedge funds, huh? Brave levels, bro.
Growth means nothing if liquidity is so low that most can't cash out and 90 percent of projects were failed, faked or abandoned. The smart money invests in the guys selling the shovels instead of the fool's gold. But you're not privy to those deals.

Sell $BTC and alts now while there is still a little cash left. The well is turning dry. Next month you will know.

Better sell while there is still some cash to get out. The ramps are running out of money and soon people are going to be stuck if they try to sell too late. Next time try not to have so much association with crime and make sure all your public faces aren't unhinged individuals, many of them with insane beliefs and criminal records.

Teeka Tiwari lost his broker's license and ran a pump and dump group called 'Palm Beach Report' until EVEN 4CHAN  dug up his history and disowned him. Teeka's monthly report was  full of lies and hype for each coin he shilled and if his subscribers  had kept hold of these things they would have seen average 85% losses  now.
Here's Teeka losing his broker's license:
