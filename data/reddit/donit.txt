Dude, you just lost $300,000, saying "It's gone now. There's no getting that back."  
What else matters?  The article was just reporting what just happened. How would you be able to say something positive, when the J.D. is going around squashing the exchanges, and apparently in your case, the money itself?  
Ad how does that even happen?  I thought B.C. was supposed to be safe from theft, or destruction by a government.

How was that cherry-picking?  Here's how I imagine the conversation with the reporter: Which part would YOU have used in the article?
"I believe in Bitcoln.  It's a good investment, and good for the online community.  Yes, that is true:   I JUST LOST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S GONE NOW. THERE'S NO CHANCE OF GETTING THAT BACK.  But I'm still a great believer in it, and there are still plenty of other exchanges you can invest in, where your money is still safe because they haven't been shut down yet.

I don't know if he was calling for regulation, sucking up to the govt, or just out to lunch, but he did display a new level of cluelessness with the statement:  "But the unregulated currency isn't backed by a central bank, raising alarms about which bodies can intervene when there's a crisis (Attack from the US Govt.)"

The other question is:  If MtGox lost some of their clients bitcoins, why couldn't they just close out the accounts that lost money, and let the other customers still keep their money?  Or divide the loss among all the customers, and let them have their portion of the remainder?  
Why did it have to just shut down, leaving everyone with nothing?  If they knew they were going to be in trouble, the least they could have done is let people have some of their money, take delivery, or transfer it all to another exchange before pulling the plug, or something.

After digging into this a little more, it seems the reporter forgot to ask  Voorhees why he lost $300,000 worth of BtCoin and why is there "no chance of getting that back"?
The other question neither discussed is what was the subpoena for, was it because of the discovery that they had lost 750,000 of their clients BtCoins?  Was that all of the Btcoins in the exchange, or what portion of it?  
And was Voorhees' money tied up in the 750,000 that were lost, or did he lose his just from their shutting down the exchange?
