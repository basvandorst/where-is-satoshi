There's no such thing as a "purely inbound" market.
Every buy matches a sell. Every time someone buys bitcoin, someone else sold it to them, and vice versa.
When you buy some bitcoin, you don't destroy some currency and create new bitcoin. The trade does not change the amount of bitcoin or the amount of the other currency in the world. It just changes who owns which.

The problem is separating sooner from later.
Say that we eventually identify some bitcoin that was stolen, but before we do the thief generates 10 to 20 addresses (we have no idea how many) and spends the coin from each to the next, mixing it up with other coins along the way, and finally buys something from someone, who then spends it again, mixing it further, and so on.
We have no way to determine which of the addresses in the sequence belong to the thief and which belong to innocent people.

The comment might be there to test the site's update mechanism.
If you were brought on to do a big, time-sensitive announcement on someone else's hardware, wouldn't you want to make sure there wasn't some sort of cache or load balancer or custom homegrown weirdness that MtGox might have deployed that you didn't know about?

Yes, a cross check with another source would be a good idea. But assume that MtGox thinks that bad guys are attempting to make their transactions fail. There was a lot of talk about blacklisting coins at the time. If a conspiracy of miners and/or well-connected nodes were blacklisting known MtGox addresses it would explain the steadily worsening transaction failures they were seeing.
MtGox might respond by a) trying to keep its addresses secret, so no cross-checking scripts, and b) swapping out the hot wallet with cold storage from time to time (which, incidentally, would appear to work for a while).

You seem to be quite confused. They clearly can't sell on other exchanges bitcoin that they don't have.

Don't be so sure. If MtGox used transaction ids to keep track of which of their coins were spent and which were not, then an attacker could attempt a sort of DoS where they change as many transaction ids as possible and cause large failure rates. In this scenario, the attacker doesn't get any coins (as that still requires submitting a "hey, you never paid me" claim, which gets suspicious fast) but still trashes MtGox's ability to operate.

*They* are the miners (and technically the relay nodes, but they're less important).
Currently, once a miner accepts a transaction for inclusion in a block it will reject any transaction that would conflict with it (that is, a double spend) even if the second, equally valid transaction includes a higher fee for the miner.
This is not in the miner's immediate best interest. Miners could instead choose to replace transactions that include small fees in line with the market with conflicting transactions that have larger, perhaps very large, fees. If they did, they could make more money at the cost of making zero confirmation schemes much weaker, which leads to a tragedy of the commons.

That's true only if everyone values everything identically.
In this case, the "loser" is the person who sells Goxcoin for Goxbucks.  If you want to turn Goxcoin into dollars, bitcoin builder is better option. Sure, some of the people selling Goxcoin on Gox just don't know better and really are "losing," but if for some reason bitcoin builder is unavailable to them (they can't meet its verification requirements) then 
they sort of already lost before the trade even happened.
Another class of "losers" are people who want Goxcoin for whatever reason and buy them on bitcoin builder. Setting aside the question of the ultimate worth of Goxcoin, the cheapest way to go about doing that is to buy it on Gox, but if you don't have any dollars there and can't get dollars there in time for whatever you have in mind, bitcoin builder may be an option, despite the high price.
Again, this only works because people in different situations value various assets differently.

I wonder if they were routinely rotating their holdings in and out of the hot wallet, replacing good coins in cold storage with double spent coins from the hot wallet. In hindsight, this seems like a truly stupid thing to do, but if you're more worried about a flaw in the crypto messing with older addresses (like the android RNG bug) than a flaw in your wallet management code it might seem to make sense.
Early crypto sometimes had problems like this. Designers were paranoid that a code might accidentally not scramble a message, so they sometimes prevented a letter from ever encoding to the same letter. Sounds reasonable, but it is the absolute wrong thing to do because when your attackers figure that out, it ends up leaking information about your code that makes it easier to break.
Alternatively, maybe MtGox got paranoid and assumed that their failing transactions were due to miners or a network conspiracy trying to blacklist coins known to belong to them and thought that switching out the hot wallet with fresh cold storage coins would buy them some time for their "haters" to forget about the blacklisted coins.

I believe it is possible to automatically reissue failed transactions safely. If you reuse at least one of the inputs from the original transaction as an input to the new transaction the network should protect you. If the first transaction "clears", regardless of malleability, the second will be rejected as a double spend, and vice-versa.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:14:25
If they used txids to keep track of which coins were spent and which weren't, then no, they wouldn't be able to continue.
That would also somewhat explain how they got into the mess in the first place. Suppose some of their transactions had their id changed. Their wallet got confused and eventually just assumed the transaction failed and dumped the coins back into their payment pool. At this point, nobody knows anything is really wrong, some transactions just aren't going through. Blame the miners or fees or something. But now, other payouts trying to use those already spent coins fail, and customers start getting upset and requesting manual resends.
Eventually the number of failing transactions gets out of hand and becomes a support problem. MtGox's wallet is still reporting the expected balance, so they get frustrated and automate the retry. At this point, they still haven't actually been attacked. Someone messed around with txids, yes, but that could have just been experimentation. Since the money involved is still relatively low, alarm bells aren't going off yet, but then an attacker figures out what MtGox did and starts exploiting it. Only then does MtGox figure out what went wrong, that their wallet software was wrong, and a lot of the bitcoin they thought they had is gone. And here we are.

Not exactly the same, they just have to be using the same previous block.

Accounting won't help you if your wallet software believes that coins spent in transactions that have had their ids mutated still belong to you.

Right, but with bitcoin there's no "bank statement" to compare your balance to.
In this scenario, MtGox reconciles by comparing their expected balance generated by summing up their list of deposits and withdrawls to their "actual" balance reported by their buggy wallet management software. Because the same bug affects the same transactions in both places, everything matches and MtGox feels nice and secure.
The right thing to do if you must roll your own management software is to compare your balance to the stock implementation, or to a webservice like blockchain.info. But triple-checking like that requires enough humility to realize that you might have a pervasive, critical bug in your own software and that not all your problems are caused by the world being out to get you, even when a lot of them are. Given MtGox's response of publicly blaming bitcoin bugs for this, we can assume they lack that ability.

Sending multiple transactions into a paper wallet is fine. Attempting to send multiple transactions out is where the change addresses can bite you.
There is a potential loss of privacy if you fund a paper wallet from two or more different sources.

There are a few cases where you might not want that to happen.

They're allowed because carrying a large amount of cash is, in itself, "suspicious." The presumption is that it was likely obtained illegally, or to be used in a crime, otherwise you'd use a safer but more traceable instrument.
The legal fiction that makes it possible is that the government brings a case against the money itself, which has no constitutional rights, so things like "innocent until proven guilty" do not apply.
It persists because, a long time ago the loophole was discovered and police and politicians realized that they could fund the police with the seized property. Opposing it can be spun as being "pro-drugs, soft on crime, and a tax hike" so politicians largely haven't dared to do anything about it.

After the fork there will be two chains, but only one network.
After a fork there are two chains: A and B. If you want to spend pre-fork coins on (e.g.) A without tainting them you have to create a signed transaction. That transaction is just as valid on B. Even if the transaction isn't automatically relayed to a B-node, the recipient could just forward it themselves.
This is where taint comes in. If you want to spend A coins but keep your B coins what you would have to do is to obtain some coins mined post-split on the A chain. These are only considered valid on the A chain. Then you can create a transaction spending your pre-split coin and any amount of A-only coin. That transaction is also only valid on the A chain. B-nodes will reject it. That means you can spend the coin again on the B chain.

It is true. Your transactions went through because a miner somewhere chose to be nice and include it for free. There was no incentive to do so. 
Well, no direct incentive anyway. Miners don't like it when the price of bitcoin goes down, and users frustrated with transactions not going through might reduce demand and contribute to that.

The key word here is equivalent. The fact that professional players who presumably aren't directly involved with bitcoin and have limited time to do research consider it equivalent is notable.
Also notable is that the time between agreeing to the match/prize and the payout is long in bitcoin terms, especially for anyone who does not intend to hold the bitcoin. $10,000 plus or minus bitcoin volatility over several weeks isn't exactly equivalent to $10,000 if you have expenses to cover.

Good question. The attacker runs many nodes scattered through the peer-to-peer block distributing network. These nodes are kept informed of the attacker's mining status. If one of them sees a block from the public the node informs the others and they all release the attacker's block and ignore the public's block. Because there are lots of these nodes releasing the attacker's block all at once they have a good chance at getting it to most of the network first.

There is a limit to the maximum size of a block that bitcoin clients will accept. Each transaction adds to this size. If during the interval between blocks (usually around 10 minutes) more transactions show up than can fit into the maximum block size some of them must be left out.
Because miners like money, they should exclude the transactions with the lowest fee/size ratio first. But for now this scenario is rare. Almost all blocks on the chain so far have had plenty of room for more transactions.
Now, in the long term this limit would eventually become a problem, but it can be increased as needed. The catch is changing it forks the blockchain as older clients refuse to accept the new oversized blocks (or any branch that contains them), so you have to get a strong majority of the mining power to agree in advance and allow plenty of time to upgrade in order to change it.

Bitcoin transactions work like checks. When I send some bitcoin to your address, that is like putting your address in the "pay to the order of" line. Other people who have paid you via the same address send you separate checks. Your client hides all this and just shows you a total balance. 
Knowing the private key for your address allows your client create a signature that everyone on the planet can recognize. When you then want to spend some of this bitcoin, your client looks through all the checks it has that it knows how to endorse. It picks a check to "cash" (or if it needs to it can pick several), endorses it, then creates two new checks, one to whatever address you are paying and another to a "change" address. That change address can be a brand new address you control, an old address, or even be the same as the source address, the network doesn't care. The "source" checks, the endorsement, and the "destination" checks bundled together is called a transaction, and it is what the bitcoin network actually cares about.
Each wallet can have several addresses, and each address can have several unendorsed checks. Your client adds all these up when it shows you a wallet balance.

If the attacker finds a block before the rest of the network, he does *not* publish it.
He waits until the rest of the network catches up. When that happens, he publishes and then there are two chains of equal length. Z is the proportion of miners that decide to work on the attacker's chain. Today, Z is decided by which chain the miners see first. If the attacker is well connected and has nodes scattered through the network, he could prevent the latest public block from spreading, meaning he can get most of the network to think his chain is longer first and work on it. That would make Z very high. With Z near 100%, the attacker wins most of the time, so selfish miners would join up with him.
The only "fix" for that is to dispense with the part where miners work on the first "longest chain" they see and program miners to switch between all longest chains randomly, effectively forcing Z to be 50% (for the case of a single attacker).
At that point I lose track of the argument. Some sort of handwave seems to occur indicating that even with Z of 50% the attacker can still win so long as he controls 25% of the total mining power. Perhaps someone else can elaborate on why that is the case.
Edit: You also seem to be using the word "efficiency" differently. The author appears to use it to mean hashing effort not spent working on a fork that eventually loses. By this definition a miner controling 1% of the total hashing power has an efficiency near 100% when the network is not under attack. Such a miner is getting the "full value" out of his hashing power and not wasting any of it. The point of this attack is for the attacker to reduce his own efficiency in order to reduce the efficiency of the rest of the network more. That is, he occasionally works on forks that eventually lose in order to cause others to waste even more effort on forks that lose.

A bloom filter is a data structure that is a sort of unreliable set.
A set has two basic functions: you can add an item to it or you can check to see if an item is already in the set. But doing this with 100% accuracy requires keeping a copy of every item. This can require lots of storage and/or be slow when sets get large.
A bloom filter doesn't store each item individually, so it trades a bit of accuracy to greatly reduce the size and time required to test for an item. When you ask a bloom filter if it contains an item, the answer is either "no" or "probably". In other words, there is a chance of a false positive. They tend to be used when the full set is stored somewhere slow (such as on disk, or remote) and the answer is "no" often enough to make up for the few times you have to check a false positive against the full set.

I've heard it said that should the crypto bitcoin uses ever be cracked we could "simply" switch to stronger crypto.
I understand bitcoin doesn't use RSA, but if ECC were broken, how would the switch actually be accomplished? Does this require that we see the break coming to allow a period of time where "old" bitcoin could be exchanged for "new" before it was declared worthless? Or would we just allow the "old" bitcoin addresses that had revealed their public key to be stolen from so that addresses that have never sourced a transaction could still be "cashed in"?
Or is the "no worries, we can just change the crypto" story untrue?

You don't "work on" any particular difficulty, you just work on the hash for a block and every attempt achieves some sort of difficulty.
When you work in a pool you submit some "near miss" difficulty results to the pool operator which proves you're working on their block, and on average also proves just how hard you are working on it. If you happen to find a hash with a difficulty high enough for the actual blockchain you submit that too and the pool mints the block.
Now you could write a client that didn't submit a winning hash, but this gets you nothing. The hash is already tied to a particular block that awards the pool the generated coins. If you tried to put your own address in there instead the hash wouldn't match any more. All you could do is deny the pool the generated coins and lose your own share in the process.
That is the basic idea anyway. Some of the details can be (and have been) changed for various pools.

The reason bitcoin is a threat to PayPal is because all that stuff you say PayPal doesn't really want to do is a huge barrier to entry for their competitors. Without all that complexity PayPal couldn't get away with its fees.

But why? The point of salting a hash is to defeat the use of precomputed time/space tradeoffs when attempting to reverse the hash if an attacker obtains it. This isn't a hash. It's the *key*. There's no point salting it.

The solution to double spends is to treat unverified transactions as unverified, not to hope miners will act against their own best interest.

I am not sure that bitcoins would qualify as evidence here. The addresses and the blockchain provide a complete record of everything the wallet has done. Getting the password itself only gives you two things: first, proof that the suspect knew the password (which is dangerously close to 5th amendment territory); and second, the ability to use the bitcoin. That's different enough from established precedent that any attempt to force the password to be disclosed will likely be tied up in court for years.

Armory uses what it calls "deterministic wallets" where (if I'm reading the docs right; I haven't tried this) all copies of the wallet will generate the same addresses.
If I've got it right, this means that both "change" addresses and addresses you generate yourself by clicking "new address" are safe to use, even if you're using a paper wallet on a LiveCD with no storage. That gets you the best of both worlds.

I transfered a few dollars in and out of CampBX via a verified but not 30 days old Dwolla account yesterday to test and it worked fine. Dwolla did give me an extra "prove your ssn is yours" credit history quiz before they let me transact with CampBX, however.

The protocol isn't limited, but if you try to write a client that accepts smaller values the main client wouldn't be able to read them and would reject your blocks, forking the chain, right?
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:56:24
It can, but doing so exposes more information to the blockchain. If you do this you essentially publish your bank statements to the world. If you generate a new change address every time others can only guess which ones you own and which belong to others, so this is the default behavior.
I've heard that some clients allow you to choose to send change back to the origin address via a setting, but the standard client does not allow this.
Another concern is that once you have imported your paper address key into a client it isn't "paper secure" any more unless you very carefully destroy every electronic copy of the private key, including any cached copies or swap space it might have landed in. This is not easy to do, and is easy to goof up. Your most secure option is probably to just create a new paper address for each transaction (or grab one from a stack of empty ones you made ahead of time) and send your "change" there.

On the front page it currently says "Trading is halted until 2013-04-12 02:00am UTC to allow the market to cooldown following the drop in price. Read more details on the support. Additionally trading fees will not be charged within 48 hours of trading resuming (until 2013-04-14 02:00am UTC)."
But clicking on the link says "Orders will not be accepted for the moment as we need to upgrade our database to accommodate the trading volume.  However, you may still cancel your pending and open orders.  Trading will resume at 11.00 am JST.  Our apologies for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this issue."
It's maintenance!  No, wait, it's DDoS!  No, wait, it's cooldown, yeah, a cooldown!
Something fishy is going on here.

The idea isn't just to give the attacker's miner's node more connections. The idea is to give the attacker's miner more nodes, allowing it to be everywhere at once. Connecting one node to every other node out there is probably not feasible. Using a botnet to double the number of nodes on the network probably is.
Legitimate miners could do that too, of course, but legitimate miners are probably not willing to use botnets to do it, so the attacker has an advantage.

Nothing except Mt. Gox, that is.  They occasionally "lose" their outgoing bitcoin transactions and take their time before sending them to the P2P network.  Some of my transfers have sat in limbo for upwards of 3 hours before even the unconfirmed transaction showed up on blockchain.info, and that was when the exchange was open.

Right. If you roll a die 30 times, it doesn't matter if you use diceware, type the numbers 1-6 in and hash, or pack the bits tightly into binary the entropy per roll is the same.
But if you do as suggested and use odd/even or high/low, you would actually be reducing your entropy per roll. The final result has more entropy per character, sure, but that doesn't matter.

That could be done ahead of time. As soon as the attacker finds a block it could be sent to the nodes, but not made public. They can each immediately start sending it as soon as they see a competing block. Obviously if a node sees the secret block it already knows about come from another node it should spread it, even without a signal from control, but the nodes could also attempt to notify each other directly out of band. A direct "send now!" between nodes might also move faster than transfering the entire public block, especially with the P2P overhead.

The password is used to encrypt your wallet. The mnemonic isn't a hash, it is just another representation of your password.
If blockchain doesn't store the decryption key for your wallet on their server (which they claim), any mnemonic that wasn't a full copy of the password would be useless.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:22:16
No, the public key is hashed to form the address but is not immediately revealed. To spend from an address you have to reveal both the public key that matches the hash and create a signature that matches the public key.

The way that fork was fixed was to abandon the change and go back to the old, limited behavior of earlier clients.
And *that* was accomplished by getting a cabal of miners together to do it.
Neither bodes well for the claims made about bitcoin's flexibility or decentralization.
