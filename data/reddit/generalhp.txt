But there is a clear benefit. I don't have to worry about any sort of physical storage. I'm not a fugitive or a spy, but that's still very appealing to me.

Hey, I appreciate you taking the time to comment here. 
The payouts have always been far less than the estimates they made when I purchased the contracts and I don't feel we were properly compensated for various delays and disruptions. In their first few newsletters there was a lot of talk about looking after their early investors as they grew (through reinvestment programs and new hardware). They certainly have grown, but I won't ever come close to breaking even. Of course I have to take some of the blame. I made the decision to invest and it was a bad decision. 
You absolutely deserve to have sponsors supporting you, but I don't think they're worthy of your endorsement.

I agree we should leave him alone now, but he is certainly not anti bitcoin. He was very thankful to the community.

Yes. Don't.

I've also got coins stuck in open bets that should have been decided on 1st January. I've sent 5 or 6 support emails with no response.

I keep the bulk of my coins in brain wallets and have never had any problems. I agree it's not for everybody, but saying you should never use them is a bit narrow minded.

I purchased contracts in May 2013. I'd be interested to know if there is a single person out there who is happy that they signed up with Cloudhashing. There are plenty of people, myself included who have been burnt. 
You have a great reputation in the community and people respect your endorsements. I would strongly urge you to reconsider your decision to publicly endorse this company.

I paid my internet bill.
