There are currently no banks in greece that use ripple, so no.  The only use of ripple is by greek citizens interacting with eachother in a grassroots way.  In that case, it isn't necessarily euro balances(but it will include those).  Indeed: honey badger don't give a shit, there's plenty of people in greece and plenty of ways around whatever barriers the government erects, including ripple.

Because you're feeding the blockchain to nodes that already have it, using limited connections that could be used by nodes that don't.


Because the problem is both distributing, and hosting the blockchain.  If it were hosting alone, we'd use something closer to bittorrent.

BTC is useful to greeks.  You can transact in it right now, you can pay your employees, your bills, anything, whether or not they are in greece, assuming they accept it(and in some cases, even if not).  It is able to cross the border with ease.  The greek economy is not closed off from the rest of the world: they are going to need to transfer money.  Bitcoin is there for them, now when their banks are not.  You can do only so much online/internationally with cold hard local cash.

For 10 year timescales it's worth considering a 10 year average price.  That price is around 84$ and increases most days that we stay above that level.  From the perspective of someone making 10 year plans, the difficulty of acquiring bitcoin at that price is a risk since not very many are available right now, but that's about the level of expectation one could project into the future to be on the safe side.

I'm not going to justify that with a response.


No, but I am a former terrorist, and I have a personal understanding of what it takes to prevent terrorism.


I've worked in multiple large bureaucracies, and that is exactly the kinds of things that we did across the board.  The shoe fits.
Should I be including a personal background on every post?  No, that's ridiculous.  I've been on reddit for 7+ years talking at length about who I am, there's no need to be repetitive.
As far as accusations that that wasn't an argument, you seem to have missed it.  Here's the argument laid out a little bit more clearly.
1. The terms "AML" and "KYC" are relatively new. They gained a lot more prominence in the early part of the 21st century than they had prior to that.  "KYC" is not the same thing as actually knowing your customer.  It is an attempt to prevent actually knowing your customer by imposing a bureaucratic structure on customer relations.  
2.  "AML" and "KYC" came about in a particular time when banking was necessary but there was no alternative structure that could provide it beyond banks and credit unions and hiding cash in your mattress(which doesn't work if you don't have a mattress).  
3.  We *do* have alternatives to banks, and the various essential services that they provide, now, for example in the blockchain
4. The "KYC" and "AML" could *not have been argued against* when they were first instituted on the basis of interfering with these alternatives, because those alternatives had not yet been thought of.
5. We have these alternatives, and when you look at them, "KYC" and "AML" fail prima facie at preventing negative outcomes, but they do prevent positive outcomes.
When I moved to the city I went to university in I would go to a bank, and they would have a pot of coffee brewing, and would have people there who worked in a fairly relaxed atmosphere and learned my name so they could greet me &amp; talk to me about my experience as a new immigrant to their area any time I came in.  They didn't *have* to know all my personal details except what would be polite to discuss, and the bank itself knew very little about me -- only employees, who could refuse to disclose things, did.  Sure at the end of the day law enforcement could have spoken to them, but law enforcement would ideally only do so if they had a reason to suspect me of something.  It's not an automatic 'we're going to gather information on all our customers, and law enforcement is going to have access to that on a whim and often without even a warrant' that we see in modern banking.
By the way, since you seem to be concerned with slavery, if you actually do some research into why slavery happens you'll see that it falls right out of situations where there are little to no jobs available, where communities/nations are organized so that you have to work to survive, there is no safety net available &amp; few opportunities &amp; role models for women.  Fixing the problem at the point of unrelated financial transactions does effectively nothing other than kicking the can down the road for the next girl to get enslaved.

...only so long as the ruling government stays in power.  Right now the conservatives have been in power long enough that their supporters control the senate, but for a good number of years the previous liberal government had control of the senate, even though they had been elected out of power in the house of commons.  They are biased in favour of the rich and powerful, and canada and its government *in general* ...but this is by design.  It even makes some sense for this to be the case -- somewhere, something in the government should represent the interests of the rich and powerful and the senate is a pretty good place to put that hold on power.  The *rest* of the government should be responsive to the needs of ordinary, not-so-well-off-and-connected canadians, though, but that's a different matter entirely.
The Harper government have been in power long enough to have taken control of

A lot of the discussion, including this post, are US-centric.  Bitcoin is a *global* currency and there is no global minimum wage.  The default 'reality' is no minimum wage.  Given the incredibly small uptake of bitcoin so far, it's not likely that anyone is going to be able to produce one that actually has the effect of both allowing the network to continue to flourish, the people at the bottom of the pyramid to continue to rise out of poverty, and the ability to do micropayments.
Minimum wage is a property of *local* currencies for optimizing *local* economic growth.  Not global.
By the way, I've worked for less than minimum wage quite a few times, and there is a giant can of worms waiting for anyone to untangle this issue if you think you could have prevented that.

You can also accept it in return for a good or service, just as TigerDirect is doing here.  Or work for it, just like you would cash.  People here sometimes forget that's the best way of getting it, if you can swing it (not everyone has a job where they can change over to being paid in bitcoins but 100,000s of people are getting paid this way today).


In the early days there used to be websites called 'faucets' which would distribute free bitcoins (very few per person but, hey if you had held on to them long enough, the 0.001$ in bitcoin would be 10$ today, which is nothing to snuff on).  I'll let others explain mining.

Most of it isn't 'criminal' - microsoft is very good at making laws in their favour (see the computer fraud and abuse act, DMCA &amp; etc) to legalize things, like its BSA swat teams.  I've personally been a student in charge of distributing mdsna keys to give students 'gatis' software for the above purpose, and seen on the other end where the license fees for the same software have to be paid by administrative entities.  If any of this surprises you, you really underestimate how much graft there is in the techworld in general: microsoft is an extreme case, but they are certainly not alone.


Sure, but microsoft has added dozens of reasons why this problem got worse from every year from the late 80's until 2013.

You can use Ripple to manage things that aren't IOUs.  There is no 'owing' that has to be involved -- it can track purely 'positive' amounts.  It could be used purely for tipping -- not a 'I owe you something' but rather as a 'I have found something you did to be a useful contribution to my/my society's wellbeing'.  What's interesting about Ripple is that all it takes is one person who has connections using it as debt as well as as-goodwill or as something else entirely and communities who treat ripple in completely different ways can interoperate together.

2) Most of them are based on bitcoin's source and are affected by the same bug and will take the same amount of work to fix, though they might be able to get away with letting the bitcoin devs fix the problem.  Until then though, for example, all Dogecoin exchanges will have to deal with the problem on that end, too.

Bitcoin will not be the last thing that requires us to actually control the technology in our lives or else face a hostile, unpredictable world.
2) As to mtgox and the "reaction" --- there are over 100,000 more or less random people hrere, and we are not a centralized authority.  You are going to get an *enourmous* range of opinion on everything from the colour of the sky to the character of the people who sent money to mtgox.  You're going to be able to see almost anything that confirms your opinion about bitcoin supporters here.  Many of us have been warning people about mtgox since 2011 at least, and likewise defending them as a potentially honest actor caught amid many forces that could tear them apart.

This part is true, bitcoin has to exist in order to 'back' its promises.


I think you think that I'm talking about the proof of work processing.  I'm not.  I'm specifically talking about the scripts that you can include as part of the transaction.  These scripts can be used for many things including but not limited to Counterparty transactions, sidechain transactions, and public signatures.  


There are people who have put images right into the block chain.  You could easily install bitcoin, get an image you want to store permanently on the blockchain, make a payment, put the image in the transaction, and then remove bitcoin entirely...the 'space' you will have taken up is now in the blockchain available for acquiring later on.  The 'unused disk space' is the space that full nodes have not yet allocated for bitcoin, but could allocate for your data.  An image is an example of something with obvious economic value, but you could imagine it could be something else, perhaps a key-value pair that resolves to a bank account number/password or something.


It is entirely possible that you could write an interface for windows to mount (use WebDAV!) to export this capability of bitcoin, but nobody's done it(mostly because it's a horrible idea since you don't get much space per satoshi, and transaction fees will slow the process down as you may want to wait until your transaction is accepted without fee, which compounds itself as you spend your satoshi and your coins get respent). I've written a similar interface to another system, and I could definitely see it would be possible to do the same for the blockchai (though the write time on it would be slow to the point of possibly erroring out....then again maybe not).

Assuming 7 billion people working fulltime, it's about 1 satoshi/hr on average.  Anything lower than that for the price of *labour* and you need to have a high velocity of bitcoin to make up for it.
Then the question is, how valuable is labour?
Bitcoin gives another side of the story, by default: the price of computation.  Right now, 25BTC is 10 minutes of work by the bitcoin network.  That computing power, asic or otherwise, could have been doing something else, so that something else has to be justified by the value of that 25BTC.  Ask yourself what could that many TH be doing, and you'll have what the miners perceive the value of bitcoin to be.  In labour-hours.
Then you need to know six more things.
1) the risk-preference of *the entire world*, the proportion between savers and those who are not savers.  Given that 1/6th of the world is China, and China has a pretty big preference for saving, that's going to tilt things pretty much to the 1000$+ side immediately.
2) the preference of land versus bitcoin.  Right now it's probably close to 99:1 land if not higher, but that could change.
3) the carrying capacity of the world to support human beings.  Right now we're pretty close but still under, but there's no reason to assume this will always be the case, if it stops being so the price of *labour* will drop
4) Any other terminal values worth considering, and the real human cost that would be worth spending in pursuing them.
5) The current best cost-estimate at lifting a human being and whatever equipment necessary out of the gravity well.
6) The extent of slavery worldwide.  Even a single slave can cause the value, on the long term, of labour to approach 0, and hence, the value of bitcoin also to drop to the extent that labour determines its cost(note labour doesn't determine its entire value, only some of it).  Systemic use of human beings as slaves can do this much more quickly than an individual.
These 6 should determine a value of labour or bitcoin in pretty much anything you choose.

While I think Dawkins carried the debate Lennox made what I feel to be some good points, and scored some perhaps underhanded hits that were unaddressed.  Lennox was very well versed in the kinds of things that Dawkins would have brought up -- while there was a lot of groundwork along the lines of "what the *hell* are you thinking" ...in between that there were a few gems that truly indicate that he was at the least on the order of magnitude as Dawkins himself, a worthy adversary, if an inferior one.  Dawkins' opening salvo alone, and his calm response to it tells us at the very least that he was reaching for something that was beyond what the vast majority of internet dialogue amount to.

I think we're looking at it from 2 different angles here.  It's true that fungability wrt currency is decreased.  So from the perspective of say, a bitcoin user, bitstampBTC != jeffcliffBTC != bitpesaBTC  and that decrease in fungability isn't a good thing.
However the fungability of trust in general is *increased*.  bitstampXXX is much more useful, and usable by more people, if managed on the ripple network, than it would be if it were just by bitstamp users and people they were able to manually convince to take it(including oddballs like nofiatcoin).  There's quite a few people I know who do not use bitccoin at all...but they might be able to use bitstampBTC as a means of paying people in the currencies they do use over ripple.  This is a de facto increase in fungability of both bitcoin and bitstampBTC.
I'd caution looking at the gateways -- although a lot of people do use them(including me), they confuse the issues somewhat -- they are an ultimately unnecessary part of the network.
I see no reason to get the legal system involved at all.  Frameworks covering it are perhaps more reasonable...but I don't see how they really resolve the problem which you correctly point out of "who says so?".  At some level the profit you get from havelock has to be a better deal than the risk of their mismanaging it otherwise it's not worth investing.  Right now I think that havelock is sketchy, but at least over short periods of time they do what they should -- and it's not their fault that they have, in a way, picked a bunch of loser companies to market.  I guess there's a corresponding statement to "if you can spend the bitcoin, it's yours" in relation to havelock: "if you're making real bitcoin in dividends, you're invested", regardless of what the legal system or any other system thinks.

While it could be argued that on "day one" (ie before it was released to the world, and before multiple validators and other kinds of nodes ended up being live in the wild), it was centralized.  However we're not on day one anymore.  The problems of the web of trust were overblown, and they still are.  I've seen it work, I've made it work.  It's hard -- but it's getting easier with every year.  We're still a really, really long way from making it work on a global scope -- and there is room for doubt for sure, but just flat out saying it's flawed is not sufficient anymore to counter the good we are seeing the network produce already, nevermind what it could produce with another order of magnitude more resiliency.

While that is an excellent list for rational people to walk through, it is insufficient reason to disagree, only a collection of things to watch out for.
* Fundamental definitions
Quite frankly don't matter.  It doesn't matter how either of you define what you define to be true.  Suppose I think the sky is, by definition, green, and you think the sky is, by your definition of the term, blue.  It turns out that we are both correct - the sky is, in my language green and in your language blue.  We ought to be able to resolve this by providing definitions to eachother that contain more rudimentary ideas(perhaps via wavelengths or via some kind of shared perception).  All we can know for sure until we get to that point, however, is that we have a datapoint that the sky is *not* green or blue that if we are honest with that person must consider as a valid one.  At worst, we can only come to the conclusion that perhaps we can be wrong about the sky being green -- by the error bars of magnitude of the possibility of error of that other person, or some such.
Same goes for assumptions.  Sooner or later, those assumptions are either stated, or something about them that is more fundamental than the disagreement comes out.  This happens perhaps not nearly as frequent as it should on reddit threads and similar flushed out points of contention, but it does happen.
Emphasis on tone and emotive responses...as you mention magnify the above.  It is very difficult to emphasize anything in text form, though, and expecting someone to pick up on it is haphazard at best.  Ambiguities lead to sets of solutions that might, if we treat the other person as a valid opinion on whatever topic, restrict the possible sets of admissible-to-both solutions.  A rational person with repeated, iterated exposure to another rational person ought to be able to work out emotional intonation and tone and coax the meaning out, and through consideration and communication trace fundamental definition and assumption disagreements out into the open where they can be considered.

There's places that have storage depos that allow you to deliver stuff to them.  They are designed more for people who live near borders to get stuff delivered from out of country, but there's no real reason why stuff has to be delivered to your house.

Of course ordering to home instead of a delivery company is more convenient, but at least you have the choice, now.

@_date: 2014-12-09 16:16:02
It's currently two peer to peer networks, much like bitcoin, run by its users with one caveat.  Ripple labs runs one website, other people run other webistes, github is where you can get the code.
The caveat is there's one type of kind of 'supernode' that the code is not yet released very widely yet for on both of them (the validator nodes).  It's free software, and the architecture is widely known but the code isn't available on any public websites.  To the extent that they run those nodes, then yes, it's run by a LLC or whatever, but the network basically runs itself otherwise.

No I'm not.  You can use Ripple to trade fiat, and I've done so many, many times.




 
So long as you always say "and trustless", and require 'trustlessness' as part of your definition of decentralized, sure.  However that's not what this thread is about.  This thread is about decentralized exchanges in general, not just trust-free ones.  Insofar as you don't mind that it's not altogether trustless, [ripple/stellar](works just fine.

I convert all fiat money I make into bitcoin as soon as possible.  If I need fiat later, there is a liquid market to get fiat so there's no point in holding a depreciating asset.  There'd be a cost to owning an amount that large -- it's not easy to buy bitcoin in that volume but I'm pretty sure for a reasonable fee SecondMarket or something like them would help me out if it was a one-time thing.   
That being said...I'm actually still looking for options of places to buy in volume.  If anyone knows of any places to get bitcoin in large volume (&gt;50,000$ worth, say, weekly) I'm all ears.

First of all, there's too many miners.  They'll never be targeted, at this rate.  I am not talking about miners -- I'm talking about full nodes.  There are a lot fewer of them.  And there are people who can track down full nodes, if they are on the network.  It wouldn't take much bribing of ISP officials worldwide to find out who owns the line connected to each of the 619 full nodes.  From there it's a matter of muscles and [big wrenches](
It's part of the [rent]( that the idea of bitcoin pays to figure so strongly in my life.  It's enough of a % of my net worth that I really do have to take seriously the amount of money it would take to destroy the entire thing, and who has that kind of power / incentives to do so.  You can do a shit ton of damage for 5 billion well focused dollars especially if you're willing to let LTC or something survive, which would be the worst case scenario for me and as far as I'm concerned, the right incentives do operate meaningfully on the short-medium term.
As for what's scary, once you've seen your net worth and practically everything you've worked towards get taken down 80% on a puff of logic once or twice, the amount of things that can scare you otherwise starts to drop off a hint.  Only the big threats start to stand out.

While I think you raise a good point, I think you're technically incorrect.

1) Don't use gateways.  They are completely unnecessary to using ripple and are kind of a distraction in these kinds of discussions.
2) 


The point is not to prevent a mtgox, but to prevent their reaction to it.  Mtgox to this day has assets.  Magicaltux to this day has assets.  Those assets are unavailable to the mass of users who have bitcoin stored on mtgox.  What ripple would have allowed, and now that that a ripple-using company is in partial ownership of mtgox could happen today, is a coupling of those assets to users who had accounts.  It's not a full solution, but it's better than the status quo, and it allows mtgox to be the middle party in transactions they are not related to, due to the presence of both assets and outstanding balances.  Any transaction they make possible increases the likelihood that people who no longer feel willing to trust them can walk away without being left to dry.


That's definitely an issue: ripple had to grow from maybe few hundred users to the 2 million it has now over a decade.  It takes a lot of time, even with exponential growth.  Just gotta keep improving, keep finding use cases, keep promoting it.

In principle, if our mutual friends were using ripple --- and that's of course is the big 'if' -- if I have a connection to bitstamp( which is not hard to arrange on my end, last time I checked ), and my friends have a connection to our mutual friends -- if they give you a credit limit in exchange for you paying them, you'll be able to use that to deposit USD into bitstamp.  Which normally wouldn't even involve me, though I've been using bitstamp a lot lately via this method so I might want to check there's actually a path through me still.
long story short
* you give cash, get ability to pay bitstamp
* our mutual friend gets cash from you, ends up owing my friend
* my friend gets to be owed by them, and gets to use my credit, 
* I'll end up owing someone or bitstamp.
The hard part is likely to be getting the mutual friend involved.

Sure they perhaps could "deserve" to have children, but they shouldn't.  Just a street urchin born in the rez might "deserve" to be a doctor, they aren't likely going to be one and this is what we have to work with.  We could drop everything and make him a doctor, too.  However there's finite resources, including housing stock, to go around and suggesting so invokes risk in not just their being able to afford it in the long run but an exposure of risk to the general population viz housing bubbles.  Perhaps there's a good moral argument for a subsidy here(at the reasonable cost of introducing moral hazard) -- but that's another argument entirely and to keep things modular I won't go there.

Facebook is powerful because it started to tap into the ocean of social capital.  Ripple is, among other things, an exchange valve for it.  It also obviates the need for "too big to fail" institutions, and the value saved by this is greater than any amount needed to make institutional change with.

The DMCA came straight from WIPO, which in turn, was heavily influenced by Microsoft at the time.  Yeah the music industry and movie industries were in on it, too -- but keep in mind this is before the technology really started affecting them, they weren't as afraid of the private copying as they would be 2-3 years later. 
Microsoft's miserable behaviour of monopoly abuse extends to 2014 (the most recent example calling their new firmware 'debian red').  They haven't stopped: the only thing that's changed is a lot of their monopoly has eroded from under them.
[This article]( is actually not a bad introduction into the history of how they project their influence.

When I left the community where I had said grocer, dentist and florist, you really couldn't.  You can now, there's an ATM there but apparently one of the main ATM manufacturers is still screwing their operators around so it's unclear whether that even works, and when it does there's a significant markup premium on global market rates.  Even when it does you have to give a hand-print scan, rendering the censorship-resistant facets of the currency dubious.  In many parts of the world, however, you really can't buy them without jumping through significant enough hurdles that normal people simply won't, including the one I'm in now.  The closest ATM is &gt;800km away, and the exchanges all treat their customers like shit.
Secondly, like many things relating to avoiding censorship and surveillance, if you're not set up *before* you need it, you end up not being able to acquire what you need when you actually need it.


Because there's no intermediary, no bank or credit union that you have to have an account with.  It reduces a completely irrelevant institution from the situation who has no business intermediating between their customers and them.

Think of what a wire transfer is doing.  You're basically giving permission to take your money and assuming that they are honest enough to take the right amount, and that's assuming that your account information is not intercepted during the transaction.  The system is designed around the idea that the other banks and their customers are relatively honest, and that locality (ie the fact that you and the other person are in the same state or near states) and law enforcement not being corrupt will be sufficient to keep in-band payments from being exploited.  
It is possible to doublespend, in other words and people have pulled off double spending attacks on both banks and individuals.

1) There's a flaw in the validation code/design, this happens -- bitcoin has had to hard fork because of bugs, maybe not quite this critical/core, but it's happened.  Shit happens, that's why we have the source code...but unfortunately up until recently validation code was the one piece of code that was *not* open(perhaps for this reason)...
2) Somewhere along the way it seems like the code for the validators was pushed into stellard itself, or something!  Anyone who knows where it actually got pushed feel free to comment but this is kind of a notable confirmation of the stellar team's credibility over ripple labs, if true!
3) Perhaps just as notable called this from pretty much day  from the whitepaper alone, but stellar's team seems to get that he was right the whole time.

Actually there are reasons to expect bitcoin will grow that way.  They may not be sufficient, and there may be countervailing factors but they exist.
* [This is a picture]( of when baby boomers started seriously putting money away, and the impact on the velocity of money.  That money will re-enter the world economy, and when it does the velocity will increase which will cause the money supply which has been growing at a linear rate (M1, M2 all linear growth, M2 quadratic?) = better than linear growth.
* the [Monetary base]( is still increasing rapidly, it is unclear how long they can do this without triggering sustainable exponential growth in bitcoin's value.
* Bitcoin is still an incredibly small percentage of the world economy, and has a lot to grow.  Even if all it gets used for is for financial derivatives, we're looking at continued exponential growth for another 4 years.

That's because different exchanges work differently depending where you are in the world, what form your money is in and whether or not you are willing to kneel to the allmighty authority of the US government (or your local government).
Bitstamp works in many places but it requires ID -- and mtgox shows what giving your ID to random strangers on the internet will lead to -- it inevitably getting stolen/misappropriated.
A few things are worth considering though.
1) Does the exchange support [Ripple](Kraken and Bitstamp lead the pack here.  Ripple allows for easy movement of money between exchanges, and exchanges without it effectively impose an exit cost to anyone using them.
2) Does the exchange offer provably-secure funds?  I don't know any off the top of my head but I seem to remember reading that there's at least one exchange that allows you to prove that they have your bitcoin.  I don't understand the mechanics of how this works but it seems like it does, and so if your exchange isn't offering this as a paid service at the very least it is subpar almost by definition
3) What's the historical volume and price compared to other exchanges?  It's not very useful to trade 100BTC on an exchange with a daily volume of 2 BTC.   Yet outside of about a dozen or so exchanges, you're looking at not enough volume to handle such an amount.
4)  How long have they been around?  Are they a fly-by-night outfit?  Are they part of the strong set?  
5) Do they mandate Google 2 factor authentication?  This is a signal that they know what they are doing
6) Is the source code to the exchange public under GPL Affero or some similar license?
7) How do you get money in and out of the exchange and is there a cost to it?
These questions are just a few of the ways of determining 'best' and all exchanges fail on at least a few of them -- the 'best' therefor is going to be a tradeoff between what your values are, your risk aversion, and your patience (for years mtgox was actually a decent exchange with generous prices...if you were in the US and willing to wait 6 months for your money to make it out of their fractional reserve crapfest, compare and contrast being in europe and using bitstamp which has a relatively relatively fast turnaround with SEPA/bitcoin).

No they don't.


Completely free, no.  Good enough for any non-theoretical purpose, yes.


They have only 'baked in' control in one direction, in this respect: they can make the value of xrp in other currencies lower, which is good for the network should they do so.


Do you have a suggestion how they might more fairly distribute their xrp?  It's a lot more easier said than done.

You betcha.   Not everyone is too lazy to jump through 'spy on your customer'/KYC hoops in various exchanges.


Not really, but just be careful as the 'default' ways of trading via bot are already being done, and other bots are probably out there trading against the weaknesses of bots that make those easy trades.

No they don't, it's just way easier for most people to get their minds wrapped around the system that way.
Similar to how blogging existed without facebook and google+ ... ripple existed without gateways.   But facebook and google+, as centralized as they are, actually did offer people something and so people ended up using them, to the point where the people outside the walled gardens are now in the minority.  It's not exactly a the best state of affiars but the equivalent would be to say that blogging doesn't happen without google+/facebook which is clearly false

The problem is the government/banks.  It's kind of hard to see, but bars using cash is one of the ways corporate tyranny starts.  Either bitcoin lives with some level of government interference, some level of bank interference or we figure out how to replace this problematic situation of a busy bar.  Personally I think this situation specifically could be done away with by cultivating a culture of not going to bars in the long run, and offering alternatives that deal with cognitive surplus and people's need for sexual encounter potential in a more positive way.  But the problem is more general -- how to get bitcoin into situations where cash works best right now.  Casascius coins would have worked, and that's part of the reason FINCEN killed them.  But I'm not convinced that we couldn't have done better.

2009:  In debt as far as I could take it, finishing the last of my computer science degree.  Interested in decentralized/digital currency systems, and the banking crisis.   Active social life, productive digital life, quite possibly the poorest of the people I hung out with, but things were looking up.  Saw bitcoin discussed on the ripplers mailing list, found it interesting, didn't ignore it --- actually practically from day  I was worried that it might catch on, and hoped that it didn't fearing that mining would take off exponentially as it had, using computational resources that could be directed to what would eventually become the WCG.  I now have a slightly more nuanced view of this.  Still kind of recovering from a long-term relationship ending and having trouble landing a stable relationship, in part because I was so poor and couldn't really do anything about it.
2010:   Lived in a storage closet, went without food for weeks at a time and relied on handouts from friends who were worried that I had lost so much weight so quickly.  Walked 25km a day to get to work and back, and became borderline suicidal.    Started to use bitcoin with ripple as a reference currency, though there was practically 0 trade value.   Got wallet working.  Ended up getting some tempwork, which was somewhat emotionally rewarding but was very disadvantageous to work at.  My computer at the time was so shitty it wasn't even worth mining, even back then.
Was able to get bitcoin in my wallet, and make some use out of it(including donating to wikileaks the equivalent of many years of my labour up until then), flew a girlfriend from america to meet me(I should have married her, but the long distance thing proved too difficult).  Was on call effectively 24/7, catching sleep only in bursts between work calls, didn't leave my home much except to go to work and to get provisions and to buy bitcoin(which in itself was an ordeal, even though the price was 1-13$/pop getting the bank to allow me to send money to an exchange wasn't easy).
Got interviewed on national TV.  Made and lost my first million fiat equivalent, debt free, quit my job and started travelling my country.  As I had been telling people to ditch their fiat for quite some time and no one paid any attention, became quite disillusioned with the concept of money.  Invested in a few businesses, cooperatives, bailed out some friends and to some extent the local hackerspace and helped some of veterans get through some rough times.   Drank a lot of red wine and ate more meat and vegetables than I have in the past 5 years, easy.  Looked into buying real estate but ran into the problem that the upper law society of canada doesn't allow you to pay lawyers with bitcoin but you can't buy a house without lawyers.  Performed with a rock band live for the first time in over 10 years, and now go for runs in a beautiful forested environment.  Worked for a startup and helped them to go from being unprofitable without a working product to profitable and in the market.  Worry a lot less about surviving in the next few months but still worry whether I can manage to make things work long term.  Don't really keep close with anyone, miss my friends and family, miss having something to relate to people other than greed and stupid internet memes.  Still single but at least I can think clearly, am not exposed to the elements or worried about my internal organs failing in the near future.

Marriages are a Social Clock.  Marriages of people around you are part of growing up.  They are very much something that "someone cares" about -- go to any wedding, and you'll have a good chance of seeing two people's social networks who now have to deal with the fact that they are linked by a new, stronger bond than a facebook friendship or something : a marriage.  It isn't permanent, and on the global scale, it isn't universal or uniform -- but it *is* a pretty big indicator that they are going to have something to do with the life of the person who you interact with.
Perhaps very few people who participate on the Bitcoin blockchain are going to understand the significance of its message being encoded in some way, however they do it, but we all understand the permanence of the blockchain.  It is the litany of things that are important, and marriages are one of the things that could very well qualify for that.

Actually this isn't strictly speaking true.  Each satoshi is roughly backed by the ability to make one publicly-verified computation, subject to the ability to fit said computation in a block without transaction fees.

How many full nodes are there?   Last I heard there was only about 4,000.  None of them are in space, yet.  A few might be on tor nodes.  They'll be the hard ones to track down, but if you can track down the ones that aren't (probably  99% of them at least) and pay someone 40,000$/pop to fly to whatever country they are in, unplug the computer and kill whoever owns it.  That's well below the current marketcap in terms of a project cost.  If you moved fast enough you might be able to take out all nodes.  It might be possible to piece together the blockchain again, but still.   Most likely Litecoin would be the new "main" cryptocurrency overnight.

No I will not forgive you, that's the point.  If you define "agree to disagree" as something completely ontologically worthless you can, of course, choose to do so with me, as can they with eachother. But in addition to "agree to disagree" there was a crucial second part -- "should".  Your imperative to conserve effort is lazy.  To say that their gap is too large and it is fruitless to bridge it is to suggest that one or both of them *shouldn't* know what they are talking about.  There are good reasons why they should -- including to the benefit of each of the 100,000 readers here, being able to conform to a correct ontology the seed of which is each of their individual ones.  There are reasons why they *won't* as you have described but 'should' is a different matter.
Your example of the sky being a fundamental different kind of thing is no different of an example as mine.  Replacing "sky" with gensyms to represent something that [gensym]( can either be 'stuff you see when you go outside' or 'vodka' however the things we say towards the set of both together *still has truth content* which will only increase if we see the fundamental difference in words decrease.  What we can do however is note that our language must be diverging and if there is a different order of our own language that might align closer to that which we attempt to map out with it.  A better example is your post -- if anything is going to be an exception to cause this general stance to implode it will be someone unwilling to fully understand the depth of how broken mutual disagreement can be, or incapable of modelling the basic concepts involved.   For example: all this talk of 'should' either requires appeal to some higher value.  This higher value is to me, a very, *very* minimal subset of potential higher values which all who aren't trolls will almost certainly hold as potentially intelligent agents.  I do not find it credible that our higher values should diverge enough that we could not agree on fundamental things, given you seem to understand the consistency involved in the universe.

And certainly I've invested bitcoin in businesses via ripple and to people and institutions who use bitcoin.   There's a crisis of trust in this case, though: investment assumes risk as part of the deal, it's where the profit comes from.  There can be no way to 'seal' all underlying business fundamentals to the investor, otherwise it ceases to become a business.  It becomes a mere arrangement.  They are a bet that *both* the company will not run away with my BTC *and* they will prosper.

The cascade scenario should be playing out routinely, every day, possibly very soon.  The point is that ripple *moves past* the cascades allowing us to easily 'pick up and move on', since we have the tools to start fresh hitting the ground running.

In the long run, all use of trust for trade is better than autarky, and can happen in addition to trustless transactions.

You must use something that can talk to the bank.  But why use a bank?  The point of ripple is to get away from using banks.
     


The thing with the way ripple solves it is that every bank can independently connect, on their own, and act as first-class traders along with every other node.  They lose their privileged position except insofar as they command wealth and can keep their customers happy.


The network doesn't care who trusts who.  It can just use any trust given to it.  You cannot get rid of the fact, at least at this level, that some people and institutions command more capital than others, and can trade in more assets than others.  Ripple only removes the additional advantages of control over the network itself, similar to how bitcoin does on that level.


There is another alternative approach that also can work: which is to spread trust thin, so that you experience a continual, but low-level breach level.

I thought r worked such that if you have the full data set (ie knowledge of the future) your model explains the data fully, your r^2 = 1, and that the extent your model explains the data is explained by r^2 and that if you don't have the full data set (ie you don't know the future in this case) r^2 is a measure of your explained variance of your model in terms of its input (and 1-r^2 is the measure of unexplained variance) ?

First of all, it's not purely debt chains.  Debt chains are going to exist within Ripple but it's actually a more general purpose network and can deal with chains involving both debt and other kinds of things.   Similar to how 'dogecoin' transfers value that looks like, but isn't quite money, Ripple can allow chains of things that look like, but aren't quite debts.
When you say they 'fail' I'm assuming you mean that there's systemic risk involved in any debt based economy, and that you expose yourself to that risk whenever lending.  This is true.  However unlike the fiat currency system, there's a way out of said system -- you can start fresh using the same tools, and the previous debt chains can 'come back to life' if you're successful, facilitating payment between untrusted parties 3 or 4 debt chain 'failures' later, assuming the network lasts that long.
There is a less serious situation where 'debt chains' can fail, where the failure is caused by a single bad actor and not systemic risk, at which point the whole point is to spread that risk by making sure you are not reliant on one entity, and other hedging options.

They had teams working with them for months designing processes to ensure AML/customers of bitcoin businesses were spied on for BMO, and despite all the compliance team's work the accounts were terminated with no explanation given.  This isn't about the lack of AML/ability of BMO to spy on bitcoin businesses' customers.  There has to be something else at stake.

There is a maximum amount of money supply/velocity of M0 (bitcoin, on blockchain).  It's going to be roughly extant coins - transaction fees * (6 blocks per hour * 24 blocks per day).  M1 (money backed by bitcoin) will of course be able to move faster, but won't be as valuable necessarily.  This already exists with exchange credit, ripple credit, and other blockchains that might represent bitcoin value to greater and lesser degrees.  This works for both short term and long term 'maximum' M0.  You could use the minimum interpretation of what could have been spent to determine a 'minimum' M0, too.
I guess the bigger question is what are you trying to do with velocity?  Determine price level?  If you have a max velocity and a minimum velocity you have a range of permissible prices.
It's not perfect, and neither is bitcoindaysdestroyed but both are parts of a bigger picture I don't think anyone's clearly put together yet.

There's going to be risk no matter what you do.  Price in BTC, use long term averages to determine prices, and this risk will be minimized.  If your company operates on a quarterly basis, and the customer returns on average turnover on less than a quarter, use the quarterly average price.  If you expect customers to return goods after longer, or if your business operates on a yearly calendar (ie you have predictable swings in consumer behaviour), then use the year average.  The current year average price of a bitcoin is about 215$. Price your product somewhere between that (ie at a 500% markup) and the markup offered by something like bitsumo ( 3% ) wherever you feel your risk tolerance as an organization lies, so that the amount you lose due to this kind of currency risk is offset by higher income from sales.  If you're a large enough organization your operations department should be capable of modelling the behaviour of your customers so that you can come up with a reasonable estimate of what prices would be if these risks and behaviours are taken into account.

2018 - Sure everyone else in the world uses bitcoin, but the world economy is in a tailspin and we should be using some local currency to get ourselves out of this problem
2019 - Sure the local economies have more or less entirely been overcome by computer-computer transactions backed by bitcoin, but the internet is kind of an outdated platform for mining and transacting, and it's increasingly clear that bitcoin is kind of bolted on to the network of minds hooked directly up to computers, it isn't 'native' to that network, even if everyone's not on that network the decrease in time between paradigm shifts (how quick did telephones vs. cellphones take to take over)...the change is happening fast, faster than bitcoin can be expected to evolve to adapt with it
2020 - Sure we've been able to transition bitcoin into the world brain, but the amount of energy required to make mining work after so much exponential growth is a major existential threat to humanity, and a drain on our efforts to colonize mars.
2021 - Sure we've been able to change bitcoin to not use mining by some clever integration with other systems, but it's still using a lot of our computronium that we could be using for other things.
2022 - Sure we aren't exhausting our computronium anymore...but it's not really clear that the security still will stand the test of time now that we're not throwing significant chunks of the moon's mass into fusion reactiors to power it.

That's not how I use it.  I use it as I'd use it on wikipedia, which is exactly how the original xkcd comic used it.  Being willing to supply a citation for a claim is a way of keeping people honest online, you can get a 'smell' of dishonesty and not-knowing-what-you're-talking-about when people are not willing to participate in reasoned discourse on the basis of their claims.


Are you having a shitty day?  You sound like you're having a shitty day.


On the contrary, reddit is much better of a media of scientific discourse than even scientific journals are, as an heir to the early-era slashdot crowd.  Unfortunately, you've also got like 7+ million people who are just here for pictures of cats.  




Quantum physics is exceptionally complex.  It is helpful to have anchors to help understand particular aspects of it.  I'll admit that that particular wikipedia page was above my level and I'll have to trust that you're correct about it...but if it ever does come up again I at least now know which page to start from.  It is absolutely reasonable for a public facing discussion to include such links.
"Gravity can't travel faster than light" would be something reasonable to ask for a citation for, but I didn't ask for that because there's been public experiments [conducted on that lately]( that I'm aware of.  It would be reasonable for someone who hasn't been following those experiments to ask though.

Everything the Ripple network can do can be done on those two platforms, and sooner or later the shibes/Ethereum users are going to figure this out.

It's kind of analogous to if Bill Gates decided to sell his microsoft stock. It is common courtesy to your investors to let them react before selling yourself: if Gates sold without telling anyone it would seem like he was taking advantage of his position and insider knowledge and ability to move the market himself rather than the value that he added to his company.  Granted this isn't shares that we are talking about: but the comparison is pretty close for the same reasons.

It depends how you define "its", really.
Bitcoin was intentionally designed to provide incentives for early adapters.  Now, in retrospect, we can see clearly that it would not have succeeded, had Satoshi not done that.  I use bitcoin for most of my purchases and refuse to work unless I'm paid with it, but to be completely honest: these incentives make it no different, in principle, to a MLM-scam.  The early 'easy coins' could only be mined by those 'in the know' enough to make it work.  Yes, there's good reasons why this had to be the case.  It doesn't stop bitcoin from being a scam, tilted to give us early adapters a lion's share of the rewards.
And it's a big but.  Scams don't exist in a vacuum.  It turns out this one has *enourmous* positive potential.  Western Union has a serious competitor in bitcoin, and companies like that bitcoin Philippines remittance company are forcing them to give a better deal to people around the world.  Banks in my country have also started to give better deals aimed at customers who might be tempted.  While it's true that bitcoin has a viral nature that is very scamlike, it also works as a global currency in such a way that would have been very difficult to make work in any other way.  In retrospect we know it can be done, and we can argue back and forth about whether something like stellar/ethereum with a known depreciation rate is better in the long run, but in 2008-9 the world looked like it needed something like bitcoin, and if making it scam-like in nature is what required doing so, then that's just what had to happen.
It's kind of like thinking of the things that AT&amp;T &amp; Verizon sells to customers as "phones".  
Yes, they are phones...but they are so much more than phones that you don't really gain anything by restricting your perception of them as phones alone.  Bitcoin is just as much: it's a way of tracking uncareful criminals, a way of doing accounting in a transparent way, a way of securely transferring funds, a way of saving that doesn't involve bureaucrats, a global scam to connive the boomers out of their retirement funds(since most of them will stay in fiat to the endgame) , a green beard, and many other things.

This is too simplistic.  You could just as easily say that the decentralized exchange is made of matter.  Yes it's true, but there's more to it than that.  You need something like a [ripple](implementation to make it work.  Ripple itself might be too simplistic -- there's a lot of things that have to be working together in unison, incentives, tools, culture, language...but when it's all working together this is what you have.

Bitcoin allows this to be automated/scriptable.

blockchain + documents that are signed with your key = allows for things to be noted in the public record


Already exist on top of bitcoin, also partially automatable now.


Perhaps so -- but there's a lot of ways to communicate than there used to be.  The friction of making deals shouldn't be very high and if it is, a technical solution is probably better than a bank at this time.


This is not an argument for banks


Banks do plenty.  Some of which need to be done by alternative systems that do not involve the kinds of resources we throw at banks every year.  Some of which need to not be done, or minimized.  They do not 'do nothing'...that's why we have to get rid of them, as soon as feasibly possible.

As an ether investor I would have liked to have not bought it at all.  There was a real fear that ethereum could have eclipsed bitcoin: it was an unlikely event: they had to get the system up and running and do it fast enough that they could capture some of the network effect such that even if they had a superior system that bitcoin wouldn't still maintain supremacy, but neither this outcome nor a bitcoin-win was 100% predictable: to the extent that it wasn't it made sense to hedge ether.   I would have put the odds on bitcoin at no greater than 20:1, which meant that it made sense to allocate 5% of my bitcoin to the project.

Remove the gateways from the picture.  Wikileaks does not accept ripple, but if they did, they'd use either somone they trusted, (or a gateway in a friendly area(iceland), but not necessarily so )-- gateways do not have to trust eachother in order for you to send a payment through them: they just need intermediaries (in particular with rippling enabled).  With enough customers(ie on the order of what bitstamp has) you definitely see that happening in practice.  


The network doesn't give a shit what you do with gateways, or don't do.  It's a personal choice between you and the gateway and has no bearing on the rest of the network.  Its censorship resistance is simply not affected.


No you do not.  I have well over 200 connections on ripple and not a single one that I'm aware of to a gateway.  You do not need to trust them at all, it works fine without doing so.  You are mistaken.


So are they decentralized parties or centralized?

Ripple is an *open source protocol* not a company.  This is like tarring Bitcoin because MtGox sucks.  It's a category error.  Even if the people who originally designed it were corrupt, it doesn't matter.  Now if you want to tar and feather Ripple Labs or something under that logic, that's totally valid but that's not what you're doing.
**edit**.  Unless you mean that they were incompetent, in which case the protocol may be flawed.  That may be so...but you need to include some kind of details when accusing *that* otherwise you're just pissing in the wind.
Either way Ripple is not an organization, and we are not shysters for "running" it.  It is a community built on a protocol, just as this one is.

One of the benefits of bitcoin is that allows you to engage in financial activity anonymously, if you're careful about it.  But entities like changetip do make this more difficult.  It's not paranoia to want to keep your private activity private.  There's things that I've bought that I don't think would be appropriate to bring up at a job interview, for example, but there's nothing really keeping people from pulling that sort of information if it's easy enough to collect.

You're thinking about the web.  The Internet is far older than the web.


You may want to look into the history of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Relevant material may include ["The Hacker Crackdown"]( and a substantial portion of the archives of the radio show ["Off the Hook"](  The bitcoin community hasn't really seen anything yet.  The scene of SWAT teams kicking in the doors of the movie "[Hackers]( is actually somewhat accurate -- that *was* something that was happening around that time(and continues to this day, google 'puppycide').


Also noteworthy is that there *was actually news* back 20 years ago.  The short-term infotainment cycle hadn't reached its full conclusion.  Things were different.


[Gift of Fire]( wasn't bad (though I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who was there).  Go look up the current cases going on at the EFF and follow the links back through their archives --- the legal cases going on today are directly related to the legal cases going on then.  There were rights that had to be fought for -- including the right to use encryption, that but for which we would not have Bitcoin at all.

I can kinda see how they wouldn't want the qt client itself to do this, maybe this is kinda a higher level UI problem.  Perhaps if bitcoin was included in, say, ubuntu, you could also have an option that if you have both bitcoin and transmission involved that it could automatically detect and sync the two if you want. The first step towards that is probably to get bitcoin back into debian/ubuntu.   But that's not likely unless the UI is more usable.  Yet another a chicken;egg thing

Yet you have it completely backwards for economies -- Ripple won't work *unless* it grows beyond a small group of people.

0.0001 BTC/transaction right now.  Let's say you wanted to double the transaction amount.

Of course...if that happens you'll probably see people willing to pay more, i think bitcoin-core even suggests adding more if there's lots of traffic, so you will probably spend more than 1.1 BTC/hour in practice.

This does not happen in practice.  That may have once been something you could say about the ripple network, but at some point in 2011 that stopped being remotely true.  That's like saying "no one will ever use bitcoin to buy anything"...it's so wrong it's ridiculous to even think about it.


You grow 'organically' -- only encode the trust you have into the ledger, and only to the extent you actually trust/are willing to lose.  If your trust network encounters any of the larger ones(which they will if it extends far enough), then those connections may or may not end up actually being used.  
Getting assets 'in' requires that you have a way of getting assets 'out' -- that you have some trust, somewhere, to something.  Maybe it's to your fridge.  So long as your fridge trusts the drones that bring it beer, and the drones trust the beer company to provide them with beer, and the beer company trusts the farmers who provide them with hops, and the farmers trust the farm equipment manufacturers...etc etc....all the way to gold providers in singapore who deal in gold, if you have some asset (gold), and provide it to *them*, as long as there is a path from your asset (singapore gold provider) to your fridge in the reverse way, you'll be able to make use of it(all assuming rippling is enabled, ugh) to pull a beer out of the fridge.

.0001btc isn't a 'hundredths of a penny'.  It's 2-10 cents.  It's .3-3 minutes of work at a shitty job, and an 6 minutes to an hour at the global wage rate.  It's worth the permission to make a payment on the bitcoin network.  However there are some things even worth tipping a hundreth of a penny.  Although I wouldn't want it to be mandatory, if I could tip a hundredth of a cent to every listen to every song in my life, that would actually be pretty reasonable.  If I could tip a hundredth of a cent to every webpage I go to on a daily basis, I wouldn't miss it.  Yet if a million people did the same, it would pay for a good chunk of the server costs.  Granted the system for *making* that work, and making it open access so that people weren't *required* to pay this is currently completely beyond what is currently available, but still -- there's tons of things we could take these micropayments and use them for that in the long run would promote activity that I would be OK with promoting automatically.  What about every time I use a word that is coined by someone that someone gets a small tip?  It's not worth manually doing unless you're trying to make a point but it is worth it, if you can get around the trouble of doing so.

There's two kinds of answers to this.  The easy answer is to provide explicit examples: 
* 
* 
* 
* 
*  (maybe?)
* guys like this [guy]( and myself.
* you can deposit USD via a couple different methods to nofiatcoin.com
 *or any of their customers and any currency they use* so long as there's a circuit between those customers, their customers and their  cutsomers customers/etc and the above.
So for example, let's say you don't have any way of sending money to bitstamp, but you do have the ability to send money to someone who uses bitstamp -- you get them to send you a payment via ripple, you give them the money off ledger, and if there's a circuit between them and bitstamp, you then don't have to deal with them anymore --- you just send a payment via the ripple network to bitstamp, where it can be traded on or off ledger for bitcoin.    There's only one bitstamp, but there's tens of thousands of bitstamp users.  The chance of your knowing or being able to trade with one of them even if you can't trade with bitstamp (because they require a prostate exam in order to use them) is much, much higher.
Sometimes you don't even have to do that -- there's a company that offers a bitcoin bridge service (I think it's snapswap but not sure anymore) that allows you to send bitcoin right from within Ripple itself, again assuming there's a credit cycle between you and whatever node is capable of sending it.  
The difficulty scales down with the extent of the network -- so long as there's no one nearby who uses Ripple it remains difficult, but as soon as only one person that you're in contact with or a business that you're capable of transacting with is capable of connecting to the network, they can facilitate your use of it.
But again -- it's a network(or a couple competing networks, now) of millions of users who are connected to eachother in various and complex ways.  It just needs one of them to be nearby you in order to be better than either of the three options you mentioned.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:21:58


I'm considering 'switching coins' as part of the 'death' of bitcoin scenario.  It doesn't matter to me if all the full nodes die and my bitcoin is worthless the fact that litecoin will still work and probably be more valuable than ever -- I'd still be broke.


If every single full node is taken out, and every single core developer and person who runs a full node is killed, it's worse than paused.  The full blockchain will have to be rebuilt from whatever partial blockchains exist among people who at one point ran a full node but no longer do (there's still quite a few of those -- they are probably what's keeping this scenario from happening, however as the amount of time increases between the current block and these former full nodes the worse this scenario becomes).   Again this has nothing to do with mining -- there will still be the hashpower that exists today -- only full nodes would be attacked as they are the weak part of the chain right now.

I used to not mind if websites asked for personal information.  Now it's basically grounds for not using that website.  Integratability with payment systems really required, in the 90's and 00's, your identity to work.  Porn sites needed credit card numbers.  Everyone needed your email address.  Nowadays everything asks for permission to use your hardware your facebook account to verify your identity.  Bitcoin is a different way of viewing functionality online: if you don't need identity to do payment, you usually don't need it at all.

I think this is ass-backwards.  You owe society from day 1.  If you're an idiot or "privileged" afterwards that happens afterwards. 
But as alluded to in this thread -- *which* society?  Bitcoin allows, in a unique way, the global village to more efficiently coalesce into a society where we can, in fact start acting like it.  We no longer need to pledge allegiance to a relatively local society like our nationstate -- we have a society at the global level now.  Coordinating our efforts on this level is going to be like nothing in human history before this point.  Coordinating efforts at the nationstate and city level have a feature that a global society doesn't -- you can screw up in certain ways, and as long as other cities have flaws that balance out your excesses you can get away with it.   Globally we do not have this option.  We get it right the first time, or we all perish in nuclear hellfire or a vast range of other terrible outcomes, such as a global depression, or a breakup into suboptimal local concerns.

*"Ripple is a system for making value transfers across multiple intermediaries through a financial trust/credit network. There is no need for a central entity to manage the value of any “currency” unit — each participant issues their own currency as obligations or IOUs, denominated in whatever units they wish. It is designed to solve the problem of central bank managers imposing their own value judgements on the economy, while being more scalable than a LETS."*

3% fees(1.5% on both sides, right?) on 25,000 BTC/day is still 750 BTC/day.  At that rate it'd take them about 25 days to recoup.
That assumes they don't do any front running, which they certainly do.  You can bet they probably take in about twice that in frontrunning, so about 1500BTC/day... so that'd only be 2 weeks to recover.

It's not really 'over' any other cryptocurrencies per se -- ripple is best used in addition to them, as a complement, rather than a replacement for them.


The 'something' is that the ledger is fully global and ripple is one of the consequences of that.  Sure you could make a ledger and just ignore what everyone else on the ledger is doing...but in this case we aren't, we're using the global state to determine local possibilities directly.

There is no need or use for an agent who shows the world who they would allocate trust to, since that's what all agents on the network do.  If they actually wanted to allocate trust they'd do it on ledger, but they won't, because they don't actually want to help the people it assigns values to, they want to profit off of them.
The whole idea behind these agencies is that they are the arbiters of who can and cannot be trusted - Ripple puts the ability to trust in all our hands and builds off what we assign to it.

These things are telling millions of people worldwide that "the price" is the mtgox price, and it's dropping.

@_date: 2015-01-06 06:37:17
Think about it this way:
Bitcoin, as a useful form of money, is something that would be valuable to steal.  The more valuable it is, the more people who are willing to steal it will dedicate to doing so.  They will attack a greater and greater class of systems and people in order to do so.  Right now the marketcap is about 3 billion.  Assuming they don't influence the price, it would be worth spending 2 billion dollars USD to infiltrate any system that touches or manages bitcoin (or, likewise, it'd be worth spending 12M BTC if you had a reasonable chance at getting a 13MBTC result).  You probably can't get all of them, as that would have too much of an impact, and crash the price -- these latest bitstamp hackers might been able to get away with what they did because they sold right away, pushing the price down for the rest of us, but in general you can imagine a constant pressure of people trying to hack anything related to bitcoin and steal it from all sides, at a multiple relating the number of people with willingness to steal and the capability to attempt to do so(more than 1, in practice), with the value of bitcoin itself.
in short
Bitcoin forces the rest of the computing world to take security seriously, and is valuable to the extent that it has.  An investment in bitcoin is a de-facto bet on the ability of its users to create a secure environment for themselves.

On [ripple](the tie-ins are written on the bank side: as long as they speak the protocol of the network, like any other open network, they are allowed on it.  Because Ripple is agnostic to who's communicating what through it, legacy banks are able to make use of it as an alternative to SWIFT for settlements,  however once they've gone that far, it's not much of a step to allow their customers to transact through it as well -- Fidor might already be doing this.
We're up to 3 banks, and 4 million users on the two main networks(Stellar and Ripple Labs ripple network, which have gateways between them).

Unfortunately this means that the pressure on prices won't be the entirety of [unlawful trade]( -- if anything the % of unlawful trade utilizing bitcoin will remain roughly what it's been for the past few years, and its impact on price will be minimal, and is roughly already priced into the marketcap.

Ubuntu and firefoxOS are potential competitors and it starts being thinkable that you could bitcoin-core on your phone without too much trouble, especially if it's plugged in.  Think thousands of people with ipv6 access suddenly having bitcoin-core running becuase why not?
 
* (85%) More people have cellphones than access to electricity.  This means the potential market for bitcoin users remains *huge*, especially if bitcoin-over-SMS services become more widespread.  More users = more demand for bitcoin, more demand for merchants, more merchants.

* (85%) spike hits 16,000$/bitcoin, average not that far away HOWEVER since this is mostly driven by merchant trade, we're going to see the same pattern.  Exponential spike, sudden drop, slight increase, and then slow decrease(25%), end result: we might be at the end of the year back around this point again, or in the low 1000$s.   People will complain(99%).
* (80%) The US government quietly takes over the entire world, as we're basically dependent on their technology right now, and they are going to introduce a [centralized kill switch available only to them]( for all computers.  This would, for example, allow the US government to end bitcoin at their whim, at some indeterminate point in the future when computers manufactured in 2015 predominate others in the bitcoin world.  Mining equipment, full nodes, cellphones with a bitcoin app installed, anything with the source code on it, github...all of these are at risk, starting 2015q3.  Upgrade now or start the risk counter then.  The vast majority of bitcoin community will ignore this risk until it's too late to stop it.
* (80%) [Dominica's bitcoin experiment starts.](  I'm cautiously optimistic - I think (75%) that it'll have a positive effect on the country.  At least one person moves there permanently because of this
* (80%) Western union will still exist by the end of the year, but expect them to have mass layoffs, and in general be bleeding money and close to bankruptcy.  They might be going 'nova' and suing random bitcoin users or something equally stupid.

* (49%) [SHA1 collision published](
* (40%) Firefox implements decentralized webcredits/ripple right into the browser, prompted by the w3c.  Exchanges will still be used because, let's face it how many of you use web calls?  But if a major exchange goxes its customers(like one in china) people will slowly trickle into using it.  Otherwise, ripple doesn't really go anywhere, I remain one of the few people who have managed to use it in practice, and it has an insignificant effect on bitcoin/banking/fidor.  Prove me wrong.
* (11%) china goes into economic tailspin, causing china to ban bitcoin there outright and imposing serious penalties on use.  Other countries will follow suit, causing the price to tank a little.

Depends on what scam you're talking about.  There's a few things you can do to prevent being scammed
1) Don't use gateways.
2) Don't extend trust you wouldn't be willing to lose, and be willing to renegotiate it if scammers take advantage of it
3) verify that whenever you make a payment to someone that the address you're sending to is the correct one.  Sometimes the fact that you can have an alias for an address can help this. 
This should keep you above the low hanging fruit.
Cash doesn't prevent scams, mind you: the ledger itself is scammable because there's value in it, and that's going to be an unfortunate reality.
As for how the credit system works, it's best to look at examples and generalize from there:
in this case, denversash wants bitcoin, and I have bitcoin, and there's 2(?) friends between us, a friend of mine on ripple and a friend of his who isn't. 
A &lt;- B ?? C &lt;- J
           
Right now, presumably, his friend trusts him, and I trust my friend.  If we determine, that, by coincidence, my friend trusts his friend, then there is a path from him to me
A &lt;-  B &lt;-  C &lt;- J
where &lt;- indicates 'trusts'.  This may not be the full 20k$ worth of trust: it could be as little as a beer, or even a gummy bear(really, who wouldn't trust a friend to repay a single [gummy bear]( or as much as a few month's rent or more.  
A   &lt;-          B               &lt;-      C              &lt;-           J 
 (50Blv)             (1 GMC)               (15000$) 
if A sends 1 GMC worth of $ to me using this path
the credit available to each person will then be 
A   &lt;-          B               &lt;-      C              &lt;-           J 
 (49Blv)             (0 GMC)               (14999.95$) 
and in response J sends A enough bitcoin to justify 1 gummy bear (maybe 0.0001).  Repeat for however many gummy bears can be justified between mutual friends, for however many different sets of Bs and Cs there are.  Longer chains are also possible, though more difficult to arrange.   Generally there's about 150 people * the number of ripple users 1 hop away from a ripple network(or about 600M people), and pretty much everyone's 2 hop's away from the ripple network(though some are 3 or more).
In short: the part where you don't get scammed is the part where you trust your friends: if you can't trust your friends to work and act in your best interest, ripple isn't going to save you.  Julius Caesar feels your pain, though if so.

No they couldn't.  And this cuts both ways: they can't* prevent people from taking their credit for bitcoin and trading it for someone on the network with more liquid bitcoin, and they can't* prevent people from taking more liquid assets and trading them for their bitcoin. On balance this turned out to have about a 2% premium cost, give or take, if you wanted to have bitcoins leave bitstamp immediately.
*I don't know, off hand if bitstamp has implemented the 'gox' flag on the ripple ledger.  It's possible, if they have, that they could prevent this, and gox their customers.  caveat emptor

The option to have a freezable IOU changes nothing.


I get that.  But in order to *get* bitUSD you need to go through bitstampUSD self-issued asset, similar to bitstampUSD on the ripple ledger.  And *that's* where people are going to get goxed, probably in both cases.

I just made the exact opposite claim; you can make the bitcoin network do some processing for you.  This is processing power, but it's a very special kind of processing power: it's visible by the entire network, and it's visible as trusted computation, effectively unspoofable.  You get 'disk storage' of a very small amount of data that you can put into the blockchain.  That is the 'x': your bitcoin is backed by that storage capability/computer processing power.

A threat to whom?  To bitcoin?  Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.  Is there any overlap in the use cases that Ripple and Bitcoin both address?  Maybe in some places -- but given that Ripple predates Bitcoin, and it is quite likely that Satoshi knew about us given how early we knew about him(within about 2 months), at least he certainly didn't think much of the 'threat'.
As far as XRP/STR goes: look at the network effect: there are countries now with 10,000s of *businesses* that deal in Bitcoin.  The whole of all the ripple networks put together is about 4M people: the global currency is going to be Bitcoin, there is little doubt at this point.

Single purpose hardware is not software and the ethical obligations regarding its use are different than software.   
 
There is not much inherently wrong with ASICS - it is generally a good idea to have source code to any hardware you purchase but source code to hardware works in a slightly different way to source code to software and is not fully analogous to it -- you still need to *make it* which is beyond most people's capability.  It saves energy compared to GPUs but that's not really all that relevant, so really it's the better tool for the job and its use should be more widespread.  Personally I think in the long run the flexibility of general purpose computing platforms will outgun its use in bitcoin, but for the near term it's the right tool for the right job.
Proprietary GPU drivers, on the other hand, shouldn't be used by anyone, for any purpose.

This is not true.  If miners continue to allow XT to exist while actually providing mining power to core, it's possible that XT coins can be doublespent on the core miners.    There is a stable strategy for miners to make this happen -- there is no guarantee that XT will reach enough of a majority to avoid this.
That said, something like XT is clearly needed.  I've already changed my branch of bitcoin to make the change -- you'll eventually need many implementations to support this change.

That's not what happened at all.  What happened is that people who sent *free transactions* saw their transactions delayed.  If you actually paid market value for a transaction (a small amount) your transaction went through just fine.  Not all wallets and APIs support paying a transaction fee -- it is strictly speaking optional.  In this case you kind of get what you pay for, though.  If there's any news at all, it's the news that despite earlier marketing Bitcoin isn't *always* free to use (as in beer) -- there is a small token amount that if sent to the miners will allow your transaction to be processed in a reasonable amount of time.

Depends on the kind of blur.  In general, the information in a single pixel become 'tangled' with information in other pixels in a predictable way for each type of blur.  If your blur is a simple smudge or motion blur, you can usually recreate a pretty close representation to the original because the information is tangled in a very special way.
Especially if you're assuming a certain subset of symbols(like numbers, each only about ~3.3 bits of information), you can do much, much better than pure random chance of what image you start with by recreating numbers at random, applying the kind of blur, and comparing your result to the blur you have, and comparing it to other numerical combinations.
In practice a determined enough adversary can unblur numbers without even the kinds of computing power that people throw around the bitcoin world like candy.

This sort of thing happens relatively routinely in the [ripple](community.  See FidorOS.  And codius.  The "anyone can innovate" has lead to these things on the ripple side, as well -- and I would argue deeper disruption per actual user.

But for sure, some of them *are* abandoned.  Using a coin once in 50-100 years so that we can keep the blockchain a *little* pruned of dead weight and at a predictable long term number of total coins in circulation is worth the hassle.  Otherwise we may end up with a future where all transactions occur with 0.000000000000000001BTCs and someone, suddenly pulls a 250000BTC out of their hat that they haven't been using, destabilizing the entire galaxy.  Knowing the full state of the economy, much like other benefits of a public, stable, 3rd party ledger has benefits that, at least on some time frame outweigh the costs associated with maintaining it.  Maybe that 'stealing' should only occur every 150 years so that it's a once-in-a-lifetime task to prove you have the 'right' to spend these coins according to the consensus of the network.

No 'side' won, with few exceptions.

The fights today are different in character, with different players, different power struggles, different things at stake.  Bitcoin, HFT, 2nd enclosure movement, augmented reality, AI saddled with realistic natural language speech recognition,

It's worth keeping in mind in the early days, there was no bitcoin and [ripple]( was one way of thinking about the p2p-money problem.
Of course, now there's a practical solution to *most* of the problems ripple was originally designed to solve(ie bitcoin).  
However the 'lazy' problem is one that, while bitcoin has incentives to solve, ripple so too has incentives -- your credit only goes as far as you've put into your ripple network.  As evidenced by this thread --- sure these guys have given themselves and other people over 9000 hours of time, but they have not received anything in return, because there's no value in their time promised.
Although there's some initial faith in eachother that ripple does presuppose in a way that is not implicit in cash, and perhaps even more than bitcoin, in the end either you put in your hours or you don't end up getting much out of it.

The decentralized nature of bitcoin makes things hard, and adds difficulty that needn't be present, although are desirable for reasons other than efficiency and for which tradeoffs have been made.  It might very well turn out in the long run a simple ledger or system of ledgers like a federated ripple system may actually be more efficient, albeit the current implementations leave some to be desired on that front (although, there is no concern that they will not scale as good as bitcoin yet).  Bitcoin incurs a great deal of overhead in terms of disk space (N users * T transactions, until we get merkle tree pruning going).  As far as being an efficient *working* *usable* and *currently valuable* system bitcoin wins hands down, but most efficient ever *invented?*  Other than ripple itself, SWIFT and global petroleum trading systems gives bitcoin a run for the money in this area.

Don't get me wrong...it's not so much the old doesn't apply -- just like Adam Smith's original insights, there's a lot of good stuff that we should be careful not to discard, it's that neither stance really understood the depth of the problems that they tried to address, and both have serious failure endstates.  Neither monetary theory nor state action, by themselves, are a pancea.

Depends what you mean by 'small'.  At 7 billion people and 21 million bitcoins(ignoring lost ones), of which only about 9 million exist...we're talking 0.001 BTC per person.  So if someone buys or sells 200,000 BTC that's a *big deal*.

To be honest, though I am aware of casascius coins, I hadn't really considered someone might take all the benefits of bitcoin and ignore them in order to have a fraud and disaster prone but usable physical token on those time scales.  I think that you bring up a good point and perhaps a "recyclist" stance would be better for something like litecoin to complement bitcoin as a stable 'silver' to bitcoin's volatile and increasingly scarce 'gold'.
@_date: 2012-07-18 06:14:40
I wonder if it'd be worth forking bitcoin for this interestellar trade *now*. 
It'd be just like getting into bitcoin on day 0, only the incentives for early adapters don't pay off until perhaps 1000 years down the line, ie the incentives are different.  But part of the ingeniousness of bitcoin is its system of incentives, would it still be possible to do something along those lines?
@_date: 2012-12-17 23:43:56


Why not?  We do not have a model of why those coins are not in play, except that we are certain that it's expected that they are still live coins in the bitcoin economy, since someone's touched them in the past 150 years.  It is a significant price signal to know that you're receiving 250BTC out of exactly 21M in existence.
This price signal fact can definitely can influence our own prices(ie rate of btc per other unit with which trade is conducted), unless we're in a market which is only short term(ie markets with a fixed, small amount of things to trade that only exist for a short period of time(for example, we may, at best, be able to see Pink Floyd play together live a couple more times, really, in the next few decades...if they play a show, you'll want to get a ticket then and there, if you're into that sort of thing)).  If we're an entity with a long enough time scale, in a robust enough market, we can set our prices for the expectation that something that someone does, somewhere in the market will trigger a transaction of that magnitude.  Really, at that point, in theory at least, the correct amount of the market will dedicate itself to becoming a search for the method of providing sufficient value for that 250kBTC, or at least as much as the participants allow based on time preferences and risk aversion.


We don't have to 'force' them to sell at all, that's totally unnecessary.  The free market allows people to buy and sell at their advantage -- at that point it's more a matter of asking yourself what can you do to get a slice of that 250000BTC.  It ceases to be an unexpected disaster at that point, and becomes a known certain event, just uncertain in what form it will take.
@_date: 2012-12-31 18:19:06
Since a "normal" person doesn't even have a bank account(but presumably by now, they have or are close to having a cellphone), bitcoin could at the very least be useful for storing wealth in a secure way, or receiving payment in a way that doesn't mean that they get necessarily shafted when they try to spend it.  A "normal" person could use it to send money to friends and family no matter what country or border stands between them(since everyone is connected within about 7 degrees of separation, that narrows things down substantially).

You just listed a problem and its answer.

* bitcoin does not offer many coins, on a global level, ergo its value will not be near zero.
By the way, a HUGE business opportunity right now is to do and pay taxes for companies, in bitcoin, for a fee.   Probably a million dollar profitability ready *already*.  All that's keeping that from happening is the lack of investment capital/risk taking entrepreneur who'll make it happen.

There are two points when a payment can betray you, when you acquire bitcoins and when you release them.
If you acquire them from a source that cannot or does not identify you, or you spend them on a source that cannot or does not identify you, you can do this.
The two exchanges in my country allow you to trade with them if you only have an email(which in turn, from a smaller provider like zworg.com + tor to hide your ipaddress, you can be pretty anonymous/throwaway with).  Likewise if you spend money on a tor-accepting website for bitcoin for something that does not include you giving them an address, name or any identifying information about your web browser or computer, you can prevent, to some degree, them from knowing about you.
This is more or less fine as long as you're capable of living nowhere, interacting with no one, consuming nothing in person and being completely socially isolated.
In practice though, we need to eat, some of us need shelter, to interact with people in order to make a living and a mailing address or something like it can be a useful thing, and each of these things involve tradeoffs between cost, anonymity, who you trust, and other factors.
Bitcoin makes it *thinkable* however.

They can also be given the choice to have their network nationalized at fair market value, leave country X entirely, or cooperate and be a good corporate citizen.  It is still, at that point up to them which they prefer.  Having power comes with responsibility to use that power in ways that aren't harmful to others.  Restricting the ability of charities and news organizations to do their jobs is harmful to society, and to the extent that these players hold an oligopoly on payment in europe, there is a public benefit to ensuring that they only exploit monetarily (ie charging wikileaks extra for being politically sensitive) and not by exclusion(shutting them up entirely).  
Second, this isn't a matter of paypal/visa/etc being told by europe that they must do something and no one else -- ie a question of freedom, since these companies would not have done this if they weren't strongarmed by the US government.  This is an act of a set of entities under duress.  Being backed by European governments gives them reason to push back to the US government, and if they continue to be pinched, at least reduces the effectiveness of denying said companies their freedom of business movement by the US.

The tradeoff, of course, is the 6 verification delay.  If the price suddenly swings down by 20%, it takes a *long* time to get your coins back into the exchange to take advantage.  Those of us who were already there have, by that point, already soaked up the best deals.

All you care about is whether or not you're getting a rig at the end of the day.  Ripple, bitcoin, cash, gold, cows...all have this problem.  Either I'm going to scam you or I'm not, but if I'm a business(which oddly enough, I am), I'll make some effort of being public about saying I can be trusted to provide goods for money/ripple, and people who've dealt with me in the past may or may not be able to vouch for that.    The better question however, is since your friend is a stakeholder in your doing this, will you consult with *them* to see if it's a good idea for you to be spending your money on a mining rig?   And that's a question of circumstance, character and the nature of your relationship.


The same if you're buying something in bitcoin...do you send me bitcoin if I'm offering you the rig?  If you think that I'll actually provide it to you, and you want it.


Because you're basically borrowing from their friends on their behalf to pay for it.  But don't feel too bad for them...as in exchange for that you now basically owe them the magnitude of the favour.


nope, it happens while they sleep and for the most of them(ie any who you haven't totally tapped their access to part of the network) they are going to be totally agnostic to your doing so, as each of them loses a little credit on one side of their network, and gains some on the other.  It might unlock potential solutions to problems, by your doing so, even, so it's in their interest to let this happen.


Some would argue being well connected within the network...if lots of people trust you, chances of you screwing someone random over is lower...but this is only a partial answer -- there are certainly plenty of people who play long scams with lots of people(pirate as an example).  And since anonymous ripple connections are inevitable...it's unlikely you'd be able to trace their chain of trust to the root.   Really the problem it solves is not the buyer running away with the customer's money.
 


The fact that you don't need to know someone 18 steps down the line for *them* to ascertain whether *you* can be trusted when you buy something from them.  You're buying on trust alone, but a trust that you've earned in some way.

Not 100% sure what you mean but it seems like that's exactly what it does.   If you have a 10-20$ (or about 1-2 pizzas) worth of credit, and it just so happens that you try to buy a diamond ring from this pizza-diamond ring store, you'll just need 980-990$ in credit paths via other people.


 is the *next* implementation and it is not yet released.  The GPL'd source code for ripple has been available for years (both for   &amp; other flavours), I'd find you a link for it but unfortunately github is down at the moment.  For now you'll have to do with my [stale copy]( or [the ripplepay code]( or [CMB](  The updated client's sourcecode is on github already, the server is still in development and has yet to be released as of the last time that I checked.


There is a significant first-mover advantage, like bitcoin, in being someone who can build up trust in others.  I believe the plan that they are going to go for will be based on the concept of a 'nexus', that is, there's going to be for-profit entities that interface between the legacy and ripple credit systems and going from one to the other will incur a small fee(compared to the legacy system) but large enough of one that it will be immensely profitable, when enough people are using the system.
It's a first-mover advantage because you'll trust the first nexuses more than ones that follow it, since they'll be able to gain exclusive trust of the banks first, and like mtgox, will tap out any market there.  The difference of course is in the long run if they screw people over the system for their own demise is present so they'll have to be at least somewhat on their toes, but in the long run I suspect the legacy system will kind of fade away so they won't have to worry about that (&amp; will be able to focus on being first movers in different areas)


This is a problem with villages and ripplepay and previous incarnations of ripple but will *not* be a problem with the next ones, and is highly related to your point   Nexuses will be the only groups the businesses will *have* to trust, and they will find it in their interest to do so. 
@_date: 2012-12-18 00:19:09


If it's a script in the blockchain itself...I can't except to suggest that it's ridiculous to try such a thing(as those who do will basically just have created a 150 year gap between when the coins are put in that script and when they will be inevitably reaped before they can be spent).  If it's *outside* of the blockchain, then all the better -- this automated system should be capable of moving the currency around every 150 years.
@_date: 2012-11-04 02:51:22
Actually there *is* something new to be gained here...what this should probably be combined with however it is Casascius works   Inert, lightweight, fracture resistant coin-balls + private key and you've got yourself something that can be exchanged with star systems that are not yet sufficiently established to get computer systems downloading the interstellar block chain.
It also frees up gold to be used for more productive things, as this material is no doubt silica based and a lot more common than gold/ie not as much risk for risking critical chain time on it.

It means running bitcoin-specific software that 'mines' bitcoin (by repeatedly attempting to solve a mathematical problem, something computers may be used for) on many different computers (typically desktops) unbeknownst to the owner of said machines, typically using a virus to control their computers.  This "mining" software(which, if it solves the problem "finds" bitcoins) seems to be configured to only turn on when the computer is not in use.
 (but this might cause the computer to become slow when you start using it initially, and as discussed elsewhere on this thread, with modern shitty hardware it will probably also cause more energy to be used)

2) He is probably increasing the costs to use windows, and proprietary software in general.  This is a good thing.
3) Perhaps 1-10% of the time, during which users actually try to use their equipment, he is getting in the way, but the other 90% of the time when they are not, he is not getting in the way, just adding to the public interest.

Not really.  Currency is valuable because it is useful and has properties which facilitate its use as 
* a medium of exchange (bitcoin is better than using gold because you don't have to physically move bitcoin from a mountaintop in tibet to a san francisco bank in order to order some XXX video across the internet, or buy some stocks on the silk road in france from antarctica).
* Roughly Stable Unit of Account.  Bitcoin isn't quite 100% there yet on this one but it's really close -- mBTC 
* Divisible into smaller units without loss of value - BTC has this, it's divisible to the nines
* Fungible - This is the part where BTC hurts the most...but in general, an ideal money system would be 'worth the same' in Canada vs. in Somalia even if local currencies are worth different and perhaps willdly oscillating amounts in relation to it.  It's not but as more people get access to smartphones &amp; hear of btc apps the ability to transfer value in this way increases in stability.
* A specific weight, or measure, or size to be verifiably countable - BTC has this
* Standard of deferred payment.  Not a lot of people see BTC in this light but I do -- BTC is an almost ideal candidate for a backing currency for [ripple]( debt systems so *can* certainly at least be used to settle debts once that system is reaching situations where it is desirable.
* Measure of Value - This is one that the market has gotten BTC to the point where it can do -- there is no real reason why you can't sell things and list their prices in BTC.  You can get consulting from my company for approx 12 BTC/hr -- that's a discrete amount and represents the value you'd be getting.
If BTC can do the above things better than existing currency than people will use it or hoard it.  The balance between hoarders and users will create the value relative to other currencies.

Tor doesn't protect from the government hitting the endpoint, no, but it does provide security in that they have to first know you've got an account and are using the exchange (which tor hides from them), and *then* they have to know to look there.

I strongly disagree that this requires a central authority.  They have a reason for holding the 250kBTC -- there is nothing on the market that induces them to make themselves better off by parting with it.  It's the task of the rest of the market to allocate resources to meet their demand, whatever it be.  There's nothing centralized about that.
Now there may be people who hold currency beyond what it's currently worth, but it is in hopes that they will be able to trade in the future at a level that is more advantageous to them that they do so.
Where is the cooperation that's required?  The central authority?  I see neither, but self-organizing market participants.

@_date: 2012-12-20 02:20:19


Same as bitcoin.  Your sending a ripple payment to me in some sense trusts that I would actually be good for the bitcoin.  But you will find, that the reason that you can make a payment to me at all, is that I have built up trust within the network by being a reliable person in this regard.  On the contrary, if you buy some bitcoin from me, and then don't pay back your friends the credit you would thereafter owe them...that is not my problem at all, but a private affair between you and the people who perhaps foolishly trusted you.


The closest thing to it I've seen is the 'buck stops here' where it is recommended to not allow for 'rebates' to bubble up the ripple network.  Negotiate with your friends, if they got screwed over, maybe help them out but don't expect the next higher level to do the same if you can. Really though, its your business whether you do that or not.


It is kind of the weakness of ripple that there *has* to be a chain of trust available to make use of it...but on the upside if you can't make this chain of trust work you can always do things the hard way without it.


A little, except the networks can become very, very tangled, so it can be a lot more complex than one chain. 


The moment I put real, hard currency into the system and offer you as much bitcoin as you want [given the above constraints].  The moment that I and others have worked in exchange for it, and the moment that you and I agree to make our lives better by participating in mutually beneficial exchange.   as it were.

It solves the problem of how to organize complex groups in complex ways beyond the capability of a 'mere' national currency and/or barter system.  It allows LETS's to work with the outside world in a meaningful way.  It allows places with low social capital build some, while allowing places with high social capital use it to their greater advantage.   It allows broke-ass friends organize themselves and divide their labour more efficiently and it allows us to use bitoin in a way that doesn't pollute the blockchain with meaningless small payments, allowing for settling to be done only when it's important enough to do so.  Although not as much of an advance as it once was...it allows us to live without central banks (this was a lot harder before bitcoin)


No, payment first.    This addresses most of your other questions.  If anything it's even more 'payment first' than cash, in my experience, if you can imagine it.


Right...the seller likely has their own reputation (which grows with every sale, really) but that comes into play when they try to buy.

There's 3 places where casascius coins come in handy
1) instantaneous, local transactions (I want to pay for beer or groceries but don't feel like waiting for a 10-18 minute block solving).  Litecoin solves this in a different way, but it does solve it.
2) Long-term, really secure stores of wealth.  You could put them in a safe and hide them in a pile of concrete, and then surround the concrete with tanks and guards and shit.  For some people...you really need that kind of paranoia.  Fort knox could be repurposed into a bitcoin repository.
3) Going places where you aren't online.  The internet is pretty ubiquitous...but there's still places where it's hard to get online.   If you're in the middle of the indian ocean, and you just need to buy a coke from a vending machine, it might be easier to just pay with coin than to run a fibre cable down for internet service.  Of course for *those* places there's risk involved -- how do you know the coin hasn't been spent?  But usually this context is obvious.
I think in the long run...that the 1BTC coins will be so valuable that the cost of making new physical coins will be almost nothing in comparison

Perhaps one way out would be to have a higher order bitcoin (hob?) that has a much, much slower block creation time which can be mined at the same time as bitcoin, which only makes sense to buy large valued things with.  And perhaps for *really* large space scales, another higher order bitcoin (h1b?).  The block generation time might be proportional to the size of the network.  Presumably hard disk space issues for recording transactions with h(N-1)b, and multiple billion years between blocks aren't a huge deal when you have a few trillion parsecs to work with.
How big is the biggest such network that would be feasible within the age of the universe I wonder?
@_date: 2012-07-18 06:11:05
What does this gain us?  
1) Transactions that are 'local' (perhaps within the kuiper belt) are probably going to be clustered and mostly related to themselves, and the higher order block chains are going to end up accounting for and being concerned with only what they specialize in-- long distance, long term trades.  It's effectively a ledger for the Long Now, (and I guess h2b would be the Longer Now).  Adam Smith was one of the first to acknowledge in his Wealth of Nations that even among free trading nations that the there is a tendency of people to trade with those nearby before those afar, between those you know and those you don't, etc.  I suspect the same is true among solar systems.  Unless we start seeing something like an interstellar walmart, I guess. 
2) It means that coins can flow quicker in the areas served by lower order bitcoin systems at the same time *allowing* for coins to be spent in far off systems in a consistent way.

You're basically already running a profitable business.  The rest is just paperwork and working within a social contract(ie regulations)...and that depends on jurisdiction.
The fact that you're even asking about the ethics of your business is, to me, a good sign.  Even if you get most details wrong, you can always take the inertia of what you've accomplished and redirect it into better ends and aims.
To satisfy the kantians, treat people not as a means but as ends.  People's machines *aren't people*, there are people at the end of the machines you're using, but their property *isn't them*.  I believe you can do this while maintaining a profitable business, if you choose to.

With you up to the last part.  No one forces anyone to participate in cryptox.  They are expensive (going from fiat-&gt;BTC) for sure, and aren't a really good store of value but...they are both a store of value and are an open exchange.  While it may be true that there's a problem in having many exchanges because the total volume of each exchange decreases...this is more a statement about the value of bitcoin relative to the amount in each exchange than a value of each exchange period.
I guess the point is that they are better than nothing, marginally, and probably also, by existing, put pressure on mtgox to keep on their toes.

1) The amount of mining resources dedicated to mining bitcoin has *no bearing whatsoever* on the amount of bitcoin produced
2) Bitcoin *does* have an intrinsic value -- it is a stable blockchain (usable in theory by other such projects like Ripple for settling non-bitcoin denominated debts), it is usable as a gambling platform(although I do not fully understand the mechanics, Satoshi Dice exemplifies this), it is usable (although not recommended) as a general purpose solution to the Byzantine Emperor's Problem, 
* the solutions themselves have a unique mathematical property which makes them difficult to compute and, hence, once found, intrinsically valuable.
* is data stored in a world wide transactional database, which is still a somewhat unique thing, and valuable insofar as that
this may not be *as* valuable intriniscally as gold, if you can imagine such things, but even so it *is* intrinsically valuable.

Refuse to accept allowance unless it is paid in BTC.  Stick to it.  They might cave, they might not.
* In the short term, it means your parents won't give you allowance.  This is OK, you can live with out it(keep your relationship good with your parents and in the long run it won't matter).
* In the long term, it gives you *and bitcoin* greater credibility on these matters.
* Instead of getting allowance look for other ways of acquiring money *or favours* from the people around you.  Try doing chores for neighbours if you have any.  *don't* get a paper route, those are collossal rip offs and the competition you'll face pushes the wage down to unreasonable levels(depending on where you live).  *interact with other people* and I don't mean on reddit.  Find out things that you can do for them, little odd jobs and tasks.  Do some for free, others for small amounts of money(to replace your allowance) and where possible, ask for payment(=cheaper than cash) in bitcoin.

1)  That's great but how do *regular users* have any influence on the miners here?  There doesn't seem to be any kind of feedback mechanism that I can see -- we can 
  i) lobby the powerful miners (this takes time)
  ii) become miners ourselves (but this takes even more time)
I mean, it doesn't really matter because the miners really have this power anyway but maybe, just maybe we should start thinking about a feedback mechanism there.
2) There only seems to be 2 choices -- however there should have from the start been at minimum 4 -- proposal 1, proposal 2, neither, one of proposal 1 or two but *after more of a burn in time*.
That being said, I think I understand about 80% of what's going on and that's not enough to have an informed opinion on which is better.  Just pls don't break my bitcoin client's ability to connect to the network (Satoshi client? 0.3.25-beta).

I see your point, but so long as it's a *STABLE* built-in protocol feature, that all bitcoin participants know a long time in coming.

You must be referring to ripple.com.  The [older]( [versions]( are [functioning]( albeit centralized systems(ripplepay focuses on more pragmatic IOU management, villages on community building and multiswap on conducting business).  In this context, it means that if you can prove to a subset of either existing ripple userbase that you are trustworthy, and if there is a trust path between that subset and me, you can have my bitcoin.  I don't have to trust you, only the people I already trust, if there is a path between them and you of mutual trust.
I'm not sure if 'a ripple' has ever been defined, except perhaps the spread of benefit of credit across a trust network, but ripple systems typically involve peer to peer trust networks that treat payment as a routing problem.

1) The fact that there were people lining up *after pirateat40 defaulted* to invest in a new "company" *named after a pirate ship* on the order of 10,000$s is proof that these scams still work -- the criticism that there's an opportunity cost here is still relevant, though HOWEVER
2)  Any business involves a great deal of luck, and not everyone's got the capital to make them happen.  Your market sector either enables you to succeed, or it doesen't.  There's plenty of places that you can work your ass off for a year and make pennies on the dollar compared to what pirateat40 pulled off.  I've worked for .1-.2BTC/hr, and I probably will again.

Becuase reputation is all you need.  No money need actually ever be involved.  It saves on actually using money, and allows money to be repurposed for more efficient uses.
It's like gold used to be...gold was very valuable, and expensive to lug around, and kind of prone to being stolen.  Sooner or later people figured out that all you really needed was a receipt for gold, that the receipt itself could be more quickly transferred, with lower risk, in more situations than the gold itself.  Likewise with money...you don't ever actually have to touch bitcoin or paper money, but you can store value, conduct trade, etc without it via this kind of method.

Unless by 'pseudonym' you mean 'bitcoin address'.  And even then, that's only necessary within bitcoin itself(and may not even be...) it is possible to design a system where all you get is a one-time key that allows you to verify trust and nothing more.   Trust is based on either past behaviour, mathematically verifiable properties (or I guess 'other').  If you opt to give value to past behaviour alone you can do so in a way that conceals the identity of the person involved, only revealing the level of trust appropriate.

when I signed up for my credit union account, it was because it was a small branch.  Individual tellers I could get to know by name.  They had coffee brewing for me when I came down to chat with them. They tended to have off hours I could drop by.  There was effectively no such thing as identity theft that would be even possible because everything was done 
a) on camera
b) on paper
c) in contact with someone who you recognized as a human being and more often than not friend
Today I interface with that same credit union primarily through their website and ATMs because they are *effectively never open*.  They change their increasingly draconian EULA seemingly monthly and their IT security policy is very bad.   I have been trying to buy a government bond or something for close to a year and a half to no avail.  They wouldn't know me from a hole in the wall and would trust someone else saying they were me in a heartbeat.
None of these things* precludes them from accepting terms denominated in bitcoin or even lending out my money to invest in local businesses and *gasp* government, even.  As far as I'm concerned, although it's always tempting to centralize, cutting costs and increasing profits, credit unions are an inherently good thing, and the tradeoff of security versus being a *part of a community* is worth it, if you can keep them from being robbed or worse, growing too big.

Something's got to give.  The default mining rewards should be much, much lower.  It's mostly a client issue, though.
* There is a problem of pruning old transactions.  I think this should be just as predictable as the generation of new coins.  If you're still interested in keeping the transaction around, there should be something in the script for that transaction that says so perhaps.   After 21 million coins are created perhaps we could start to see the coins start to disappear at a linear, random rate unless spent, and then regenerated.  In the long run this problem is going to hurt, imho.

1) In subsets of addresses, it's more or less instantaneous.
2) You don't actually have to have bitcoin to start using it, you can bootstrap yourself and your community into posession of it.
3) You can discard all kinds of data that isn't feasible to do so with bitcoin saving all kinds of storage space, all that's important is the current state, and even that isn't set in stone (people may adjust credit limits and it's up to the 'lowest common denominator' as far as whether any activity continues to take place).
4) Now, with hindsight of a month or so, we can see that it allows for decentralized exchanges via 'nexuses', at least in the next version
5) (not implemented yet) In theory payment can automatically generate activity in smart objects.  In a kind of blended [ripple]( system you could automatically enable production from within the payment itself based on mutually beneficial trades.  You could do similar things with bitcoin alone, of course, but a lot of the pieces are already there with ripple.

They caught him off guard.  His plan has been pretty consistent:
1) gather a critical mass around the system so that there's a market for it, so to speak.  Ripple is potentially highly viral in nature, in a world without bitcoin especially so.  The longer we wait though the more niches that are filled by other systems.  The system becomes valuable through use
2) "nudge" people away from thinking in harmful, exploitative ways and make the global village work.  [Villages]( is a fairly radical attempt at this.  This isn't a one day project - it's a long term plan in itself.
3)  Make the centralized ripple sites able to fulfill the protocols, create libraries to handle the details, make the sites increasingly usable and useful to the crowds who would by that point use them.
I would prefer "Make system truly decentralized" at the top of the list but then again, I have my own priorities, and haven't been assed to learn python and do it myself.

1) Google is not yet "the internet"
2) Difference is critical - google runs on *their* servers, while Microsoft would run on *his*.  Google can and should do whatever the fuck they want.
3)  Under similar reasoning "Democracy" and "Human rights" might be "too much much for busy people".
4) It is true that a lot of people are stuck in situations where they must give up basic rights to survive.  Hell, I'm a proprietary software developer, despite my attempts to do otherwise.  But we should have no illusions of what the actual situation is.

Again ...the exchange *does not have to use tor*.  There may or may not be a benefit to the exchange using tor.  The exchange merely needs to not discriminate against tor users.  Like just because the exchange doesn't discriminating against Tibetan users doesn't mean that it has to run using them.
If you *really* are paranoid you could take the next step in registering a bank account for the sole purpose of using that exchange...but my point is that while it is true that the government *could* track you if it knew you were using an exchange  they have to know that first, and if you're using tor they *do not know that*.  If you have a way of setting up a bank account without it being tied to you,  while that's a separate practical problem for sure, it's tractable (although, *that* would be ML and whatever actions you take there you can expect the exchange to have protections against).  But it doesn't matter whether it's tractable or not -- it should not be the exchange's business whether you're living in a politically dangerous area or not.  You should not have to turn off tor for the sole purpose of letting governments spy on your use of exchanges, and people like me who run tor exits should not be banned from using all exchanges.  It's ridiculous.

I disagree.  The best we can hope for is better than the psuedonymity case - the ripplers mailing lists has discussions along these lines every so often and there is a strong case to be made that it is possible to design a system gives metrics on the reliability of a person in the past.  Of course, there's no guarantee that 'this time' the agent won't defect, it can get to the point where you have more to lose by defecting than by not.  Trust metrics aren't perfect but they are something. 
How would it work?   If every payment came in two parts - a part with a large value and no comment and a small value with a large comment you could easily do a query on an address(hell, everyone's got the block chain and can independently verify) and receive an ebay-like star-summary if someone went through the effort of implementing such a thing.  It's doable and wouldn't include anything other than trust.

That's fine...it's a different thing being measured.  Instantaneous value.
Another thing that is important is value created in a time interval.  Time being the key.
When we've got a trillion or two dollars of value changing hands in a year, we'll have, even if the market value is what it is today, something much more than we have right now.  And there's no need it wouldn't be the same as it is today, just with a (much) higher volume.

It mostly started when Ripple Labs(then OpenCoin) promised to release their version of Ripple as open source...but took their sweet ass time doing so.  This caused people to get alarmed, and resulted in some major day-1-shit-fuckups when the source code was released that took down at least one major bitcoin exchange and stung a few more.  On top of that, before Ripple Labs got their shit together, and before the rest of the ripple community was really big enough to serve as a counter weight, bitcoin loan shark companies started, and flourished, so by the time Ripple began to become large enough to meaningfully threaten them, they were large enough to sustain a significant PR campaign against them.  Then, Ripple Labs cozied right the hell up to the US federal reserve and has not held punches in saying negative shit about bitcoin.  Coupled with a lot of ignorance and you have a recipe for hatred.

True, and there's some difference between the networks, here.  But ask yourself, back in early 2011 or whatever when there was still only 100,000 bitcoin users, was it so difficult, then, to compromise the mining process?  If state actors had wished to do it, they would have succeeded, just like large banks could probably succeed with bitcoin now.  Ripple's design may make it an order of magnitude or more easier, but it's still the same kind of difference .  They opted to ignore the network and it grew.

Ripple didn't kill justcoin.  Justcoin killed justcoin.  Blaming Ripple for justcoin's downfall is like blaming Bitcoin for the transaction malleability issues that mtgox faced: ie it's ludicrous.  Bitstamp continues to operate on Ripple, why? Because Ripple isn't broken.
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:56:27
Because some of the largest exchanges in the history of bitcoin have (rightfully) utilized ripple to allow people to bridge the gap between the bitcoin world and the fiat world.  If you have a bank or a financial institution that can talk to the ripple network, you can probably transact with bitstamp, and on-ramp onto the bitcoin network more generally in a way that is impossible in many situations.  
There's many other reasons but that alone makes it notable.
@_date: 2015-04-16 00:40:31
The IEEE is mistaken.  Ripple can be used to manage debt and loans, but it can also manage things that are not debt/loans (though it probably doens't do "work" very well, it can definitely manage assets, both on and off ledger).  The english language does not appear to have a word to describe this general construct, mostly because it didn't exist until Ripple allowed it to.


It's not just "a feature" this is the *entire point* of Ripple.  If you don't want to use it, that's fine, bitcoin will continue to be available - but there's legitimate uses for this.  You're spreading FUD about how it's "infinitely abusable" -- sure it's abusable, but any system of this kind is going to come with costs and benefits, and the benefits in this case of being able to break free of autarky continue to beat the costs of spooky action at a distance.
That said, this action by Ripple Labs is idiotic and I recommend no one use that client.

Actually this isn't completely true.  People in underbanked situations tend to use a mixture of many currency-like things and payment methods, whatever works in practice.  Volatility isn't as much of an issue for the really low end as it might be for the middle class who use it as a savings medium.

We have gone awhile since the last one, but even up to a year ago, we didn't go more than a month or so without a major exchange going bust, followed by a predictable cry of "why isn't there something like ripple that exists to help us avoid this happening again" followed by the ripple community suggesting ripple followed by the bitcoin community saying "ripple is a stupid idea" followed by another exchange going bust [repeat].  We are in still in this cycle.

On the contrary: there is plenty of trust to go around, we just need to tap it.  Every recurring payment in the world could be quickly coopted into trust: I trust that the local power company will give me electricity if I pay for it.  If they give me electricity in exchange for my owing someone else instead of the power company, that is not a huge deal to me for the most part.  Same thing for mobile phone service...rent...food...water... on the internet we all trust the tools we use: the web browser, the OS, the crypto developers: there's a lot of latent trust all over the place.  Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman should never have to buy anything ever again with either money or bitcoin: the amount of credit they have with the world should be practically infinite, for example.

1) Ripple is not limited to IOUs.  This criticism is valid, but only valid to the extent that you're talking about using Ripple for IOUs
2) DO NOT USE GATEWAYS.  And definitely do not store value on them long term.  This is an equivalent statement to "do not leave bitcoin on an exchange".  Obviously, to some extent, you have to if you intend on trading on it -- and to that extent maybe something like BitUSD might even be better in the long run.  But  Gateways are a central point of failure waiting to happen and their use should be taken with great caution.  You do not "need to go through a gateway" and thus you do not need to expose yourself to that kind of centralized risk.
3) Even given the above... "no point in trading a bunch of digital IOU" is BS.  If you need to buy a glass of water in the desert and the person selling water in the desert has a ripple path to you...you're going to use it.  It's useful because it makes use of resources that currently exist in an efficient way, just as any other token or money system.  Sure there's going to be pros and cons but the unique thing that you have not discounted is the use of social and other kinds of capital in an efficient manner, that is not as feasible without using the system.
4) It isn't a statist network, though Ripple Labs is trying really hard to make it so.  It is state-agnostic, unlike bitcoin which is actively libertarian.

That isn't how consensus, or the ripple network works.  The nodes choose their nodes to trust, and the consensus is made from those choices.

To make sure that people don't spam the network.


Not just bank transfers, transfers between people who aren't banks, too.


That is one problem.  That is not the core problem which Ripple addresses.


In theory, yes, it probably can...but we've had Ripple working on some level or other for a decade now whereas bitcoin still does not work for this purpose yet -- we cannot afford to wait.

If by "they" you mean Ripple Labs, no they haven't, as far as I'm aware, but in general there's more to the ripple community than Ripple Labs -- they could cease to exist and we'd still be going on with taking on SWIFT without them.

Great (especially for russians) but ...doesn't help given they censor tor users and do what they can to de-anonymize users.

Point of order: at this point I don't give a fuck about the company: I'm in this entirely for their 100,000 users and the stellar userbase who are, for better or worse, painted by their actions.  While I wouldln't throw fecal matter at RL, I'm really dissatisfied with them right now.

Because it's not a "coin" but an [entire payment system](-- if you're looking at stellar like an investment, you're looking at it wrong, but if you're looking at it as a way to connect and manage [LETS]( worldwide, or to boot communities out of autarky, yeah it can work very well for that.

As do many companies in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Sure, it's shitty that Ripple Labs is taking part in this -- there's no doubt they are.  But you don't need to associate your real identity with your ripple account, just as you don't in bitcoin (though unlike in bitcoin, there's more to it in that while you can start anonymous, depending on who you trust will probably end up saying something about you)

It is not just an IOU system.  Yes you can use it for IOUs but  you can use it for other things, too.  The fact that we don't have a word for the more-general-than-IOU thing is a clue that this it was new (at least as of [2004-6]( and as of at least whatever part of the late 90's/early 00's that the Anarchist FAQ was written it was clearly leading up to the creation of Ripple, but never made it that far -- the chapter on Ripple has yet to be written, because no one's ever done made it work successfully before


Do you have any idea how much trouble it is to connect a random linux box to SWIFT?   You can hit a public API on a ripple node after a couple of googles/copy/pastes and you're immediately in play.  Developers cannot just connect and/or add functionality to SWIFT on a bored moment, anonymously, without telling anyone that you've done so.  You can do that for ripple.  
SWIFT does not allow people to experiment on their network, and doesn't allow who they literally call "peasants" in their internal documentation to connect to it.

It is not "just like bitcoin".  It is not a trustless environment, and unfortunately ripple labs still has a good amount of control over the network -- it is not nearly as popuplar as bitcoin and even among the people and institutions who use it, the vast majority, unlike the early days with bitcoin, have no interest in making the network itself work, they just want it *to* work.  And that's a big difference.  Ripple  is a bitcoin *complement* not a bitcoin replacement.


No it isn't.  It takes what SWIFT is and makes it feasible for normal human beings to compete directly head to head with banks.  This is not the same featureset that bitcoin offers, but it is still a big deal in a world with too big to fail banks.

Ripple can be used for more than the exchange of IOUs.


Though it is handy in some cases where public verification of payment is viewed as a good thing. It makes Ripple, in effect, a triple-entry book keeping system.


True, we can always do better, though in 2011 there was not nearly the amount of people and tools capable of producing such a system as there is today.

While it can be used as a replacement for interbank transfers it is a *peer to peer payment system*. This means *between peers*, banks or non-banks (ie regular people).  Banks have no more access or rights to to the ripple network than you do, except possibly that they might be more likely to run nodes.

Sure.  And maybe in the future we can work on getting rid of all forms of counterparty risk (lol).  But right now there are central banks to kick onto the curb, "too big to fail" institutions who control investment and people who are living on the street in part because the financial system specifically excludes them.   Counterparty risk is not the only risk in the world nor is it the most pernicious.


You don't have to -- that's the whole point.  I don't know who you are and there's no reason for you to accept themusicgod1USD and hell I don't deal in USD practically at all.  The point is, the network can find a path from themusicgod1USD to bitcoin if there is one and *that's* what your site is going to be interested in.  You won't even be able to know what it is happens on my side -- all you see is the currency *you* want to transact in appearing.

Because you can trade them for other things(trade value), and some people just like special numbers(inherent value) and other people just *really don't like the central banking system* and any tool that pisses the central banks off is valuable(=destructive value).  In fact they have some properties that make them easy to trade and ridiculously hard to counterfeit makes that value higher, the fact that not everyone accepts them makes the value lower.  There is a continual balancing between those who want things but have bitcoin and those who have things and want bitcoin (for the above reasons or to balance their short term and long term risk)...such that in the end, it's turned out to be about 13$cad/btcish.

things different now:
1) globally integrated world.  Wages everywhere are slowly approaching china's.  Real wages in the west haven't improved since china started trading with the US in significant amounts.
2) Women joined the workforce in the west -- pushing wages down to the point where you *had* to have 2 incomes
3) banks have created limitless debt, allowing people to spend further and further ahead
4) Everything manufacturable has effectively gotten cheaper, but the real cost of housing has risen because of population growth.  The same amount of space to fit people more or less doesn't scale with 6x the population.
5) Retiring didn't even really exist as a concept until that long ago in its modern form, and you definitely didn't see the majority of the population live as long as we have been.  This is going to be more expensive by default.
None of these things are due to 'the state' and all have put pressure on wages and increased the cost of housing.

Sorta.  Your computer looks for a solution to a specific kind of hard math problem.  If it finds the solution to it, your computer uses the solution as a 'proof of work' -- and is rewarded for this 'proof of work' by the network via some clever code.
So in a sense you're getting paid by bitcoins for finding these hard to find solutions and your computer doing some other stuff, basically upkeep for the network as a whole.  But don't count on it -- unless you have a fairly powerful computer the chances of you being paid in this sense is very small -- the 'being paid' part works kind of like a lottery, where most people do not end up making any(hence why people use clients...clients trade off to make a small amount of money more frequently than a large amount of money almost never).

Not everyone is going to switch.  I'm still CPU mining and I don't intend to switch to GPU mining(or FGPA...or ASIC...or quantum or whatever) because quite frankly, I'm sticking to my 8 year plan on tech purchases.  At some point the tech will grow beyond your investment capabilities -- and you'll just stop caring.  If enough people drop out, the profits will increase -- and the incentive will raise for people to start investing again.  But it never was and never will be 'everyone'...lots of people have a little bit of cpu power but not much to play around with.  Mining might mean some extra income but basically none.

I don't write software to mine but I think the argument goes something along the lines of 
* mining costs money in terms of computing costs.  As time goes on, more and more of the mining is going to be done by dedicated professionals (server farms, asic farms, people in remote locations who have low cost power/heat dissipation(iceland, canada, russia, norway, sweden, finland, antarctica, australia ))
* In the long run, people don't do things that cost money unless they get paid for it.
Of course there are other reasons why miners would include this payment in their block
* Selectively doing stuff like this takes extra logic(=extra work), might as well just grab the next payment and include it.
* Making sure payments like this go through means that bitcoin as a system continues to work and miners are incentivized to make this happen in general.  They are just *more* incentivized to make this happen faster for people who pay via transaction fees.
* Would you piss off someone who was sending a million dollars through your computer?

Actually good article with one exception:  the velocity of money in the bitcoin world did *not* slow during this time period, it only accelerated.   We were seeing days according to bitcoinwatch that almost 90% of the coins changed accounts.  Now how much of that changed hands is hard to tell...but still, this is an insanely high velocity of money.  We're still even now at 1/7 of the coins in the economy changing hands daily, that's huge.   Granted, that's not happening on mtgox, but still - it's happening in the broader economy.  So in conclusion, you could say that a lot of people lost value in their coins...but at the same time *someone* made out like a bandit, and the net gain/loss is probably closer to 0 than you might think.

While I appreciate the sentiment, the argument is invalid for there is no point to holding something that is worthless - it has to be valuable.  That is to say, if the scheme is valid, then bitcoin is valid and once the creators end up spending their newfound wealth, the system will be in place, and storing and creating value for us all by that point.  Yes the people who got in early got rewarded to a huge degree - - but have you ever tried to create an economic system that rivals the western central banks?  It's fucking hard.  The early adopters are probably going to face jailtime if this persists -- might as well reward them while we still can.

Look; the reason this crash was able to happen in the first place is there *wasn't enough market depth* and the attackers were able to take advantage of this fact.  If there were more people like this supposed 'kevin' character, who were buying low, the attacker wouldn't have been able to pull it off --- the price would have bottomed out at some higher level (although absurdly low) and the market would have rebounded after he basically 'gifted' the economy with his coins.  As is, he made off like a bandit. 
'Kevin' did the market a great service by taking a lot of the coins from this 'attacker'.

There are going to be *MANY* choke points.  This is just the beginning.  But as any software developer worth his salt knows, choke points are a fact of life.  Some can be routed around, others can be fixed, and some you can rewrite behaviour at a higher or lower level to manage the situation so they don't arise.  Bitcoin is going to have to deal with these issues - it's doing a decent job by the sounds of it so far, but could do better.

I would argue that we're moving in 2 parallel directions: on one hand, centralization is certainly happening (Kraft buying Heinz is the best example this week), but on the other, bitcoin and ripple (and now  ) are moving towards power being balanced on the other side of that sword.  It's a struggle as old as human history and it's not going to end in our lifetimes.

Of course not.  I mean to say the only way to do so in a way that isn't status gaming that I'm aware of after a few moments of thought might be to keep it purely functional.  If it's synced up to something like the code we use it can be used as a straw poll for certain things (say the bloom filters change, or something like that), while still making sure that it's bitcoin-related (and not altcoins).  Or rather: if we're going to allow status gaming here: make sure that it's useful for something.  
That's just one example, though.  There may be other examples of more or less purely functional indicators that could be used that could be useful to the network.

OK I guess I've been only a user for 9 (I know what year it is &gt;_&gt;) but in 2006 it looked like a promising system, if only there were people to use it with.  You could sign up for an account but it wasn't really all that useable until you found other to use it with.   We hadn't hit any bottlenecks of any kind.  I think in 2005 even the mailing list hadn't started yet so you kinda had to know someone like Ryan to discuss with him.  It was then growing roughly exponentially, and that's how it continued growing, in bursts here and there, much like bitcoin, all the way to last year.  But, in the context of what I said: it worked, and it worked and we were able to build on what worked for years and enable that exponential growth with new use cases, new users, and new potential at every level.

As in "Ripple Labs would like to profit" I'd imagine so.  It's an open source project with a main developer. It's kind of like Red Hat in that sense.  Is RHEL a for-profit project?  Yeah.  Are they still doing a favour to the rest of us?  Sure, as long as fedora continues to be around.


Given the only part that people even could complain about until lately was the validator code and after a little bit of digging around on github I found it...what part isn't yet "fully" open sourced?  


As I've addressed elsewhere in this thread: XRP isn't a "coin", it isn't an IOU to anyone, and calling it an IOU coin is kind of a contradiction of terms, anyway.


Sure: we learn from eachother.  No one would deny that.


This is I think, the root of our particular disagreement -- the question of tactics and the choice of which principles are necessary.

There is no mining in Ripple, there is no "pre-mining" and frankly there is nothing of value to 'premine'.  Even saying this paints you as someone who doesn't fully understand the system.


A scam benefiting who, exactly?


Do you know what it takes to migrate away from ripple?  You simply export your balance, move to stellar, and communicate with those who you had a balance with before, and continue on.  There is very little "control" that RL has in practice over anything.  It is a communications network for value.  A ledger system.  Like bitcoin it's the gold that turns to lead if someone tries to steal it.


There are over 4 million users.  Sure some of them are going to be idiots (though I'd question how many, given how difficult it is to set people up with it most of the time, the idiots don't get far enough to participate usually).  I know someone who uses ripple who has 5 degrees(3+ in STEM fields, *and* a masters in physics with a focus on quantum-level phenomena), and a very low erdos number.  Ripple used to, at least at one point, be the kind of thing that you'd only ever find if you were interested in obscure financial topics including financial cryptography -- writing us all off is writing off some absolutely staggeringly smart people who came to the network from a variety of backgrounds, and saying that *all* of them are idiots.  Just no.

BTC is notorious for *well informed, technologically savvy people*.  "Shady  people" to this day mostly deal in cash and cash alone.  Think of it this way: you hear about all the shady stuff that happens in bitcoin, but the stuff that isn't shady isn't newsworthy, and you don't hear about it.

Fucking rights I am.  The Ripple community is what lead me to bitcoin in early 2009, and allowed me to acquire my first bitcoin.  I have been remarkably consistent on this subreddit over the years in my defense of Ripple.


XRP *is not supposed to be valuable*.  If it *is* valuable the network cannot work.  That is a design flaw and RL has to balance between having a network that actually works as designed, and one where they, as the initial holders of XRP can benefit.  But XRP is an insignificant part of the network.  It's like being concerned that the first few bits of the blockchain start off with a message you don't control.  And since we've been around in the crypto world longer than bitcoin, by the way, you do not get to say what is and is not 'generally used' -- we do.  XRP is not a 'coin' it is not 'mined' and there is no 'pre-mining' going on.
 


Ripple labs could disappear tomorrow and we would almost not even notice.  It's like the bitcoin foundation only they have more of the nodes running relative to the rest of the network. 


 
Then don't become an 'officially sanctioned' gateway then?  If you want to gain the benefit of having RL promote you, then do what they want.  Otherwise, do whatever you were going to do without involving them.


Fuck off.  I've been on TV promoting bitcoin and have sold dozens of people on the idea.  I belong here if anyone does.

Ripplepay was marginal when it hit - the community has continued to grow at roughly the pace it was growing when it hit (if anything we got a speedup from bitcoiners who every time a major exchange goes bust, but remember that ripple exists, that the ripplers weren't affected -- see the recent bitstamp problems, and how even during their downtime, their ripple address continued as normal with basically unnoticeable differences in price).  We would have to stagnate for at least another year or two to fail to follow the exponential trendline going back that far (an exponential rate much less than bitcoin, but still exponential).


I think part of this is attributable to management but part of it is just attributable to the 'cooling effect' of people who are interested in that sort of thing moving on to other companies who work closer with the bitcoin blockchain and with StellarOrg.  Every time someone leaves ship at RL it seems like it gets more radically committed to the legacy banking system.

You are confusing Ripple with dogecoin or something.  The two are so completely different and the models for success are so completely different it's hardly worth even comparing the two.
Ripple is not even close to a ponzi.  There is no getting rich because your asset appreciates.  The main benefit is that value that you create can interoperate on a wider scope, that your non-fungible assets can become more liquid/fungible.  It stretches the imagination to consider people who are trading minecraft diamonds who just happen to use ripple for bookkeeping or whatever as partaking in a ponzi scheme, just because there's a system that allows for them to trade with people who have goats and who want minecraft diamonds if there is a market maker between them to allow for such a trade.

There is innovation both happening internal to the network, and at the edges.
In the past month or so the network they've now managed to build tools around the edges to allow for peer to peer reporting of scams, a successful 'partial memory' of the full transaction of the ledger (allowing for *way* more efficient servers, at the cost of some risk of history eventually getting lost if no full servers are used...but this makes a new kind of 'jubilee' possible that has never been attempted in human history), and a way of resetting passwords (which is itself a big feat on a p2p network).
On the boundaries...there is *all sorts* of new ways that [ripple/stellar](is being used that even I have trouble keeping up with these days.  You can interface with SEPA, systems that talk to M-PESA, earthport, fidor's operating system fidorOS, codius (in itself hugely innovative), you can pay for prepaid phone service all over the world(almost everywhere other than canada), and there is a new startup starting up pretty much every week doing something new.

Maybe, but I'm a bleeding-orange [dipper](-- in most sane places, healthcare should be a public service, free to use.  It pays for itself in not having mangled, broken people with shorter lifespans.   Designing the apparatus and society capable of managing it is a Hard Problem -- I wouldn't even try to do it in the US.  But in civilized countries, it is certainly doable, at least while in the time before alternatives can be designed.  I think we can design an economy around the idea of free healthcare, and as a starting point, it is quite possibly as important as the right to own private property itself, if not much more.
Absolutely bitcoin keeps everyone honest: but it's not the only tool in the toolkit.  [Ripple](allows for bootstrapping out of autarky -- it's getting rid of that autarky that is the path to prosperity for most part.  But even without that, with bitcoin -- an accountable healthcare system would not be more difficult to create and maintain than it was in the early days when Tommy Douglas first tried it, and succeeded.

However buying at an exchange is only a last resort, especially these days -- there's enough people out there that you could do much better by working for bitcoin directly.

It is not "valueless" to be able to mint your own currency in some contexts.  For example, at many events in canada you can go to you get two "meal tickets" or "drink tickets", on the house.  This is a paper currency acceptable in a limited context -- there's no reason why these could not be digital.  Yet there's nothing keeping someone from having their own event with similar tickets.

"locking in" the rate is a Hard problem.   I've argued for years that merchants should be ignoring the day to day prices and focusing on longer-term prices(typically a year-long average, though depending on the business model other averages may be more apropriate, like a quarterly average or a decade average).  Right now this would mean selling their goods at a cheaper than normal price -- but overall the past few years it would usually mean selling at a higher price.
Of course the best way of doing this is probably in the middle of these two extremes; some extra cushion based on the long-term price, some 3rd party interference depending on how finicky the customers are.  Depends on the business, but there's definitely a  tradeoff there.
There's a good argument to be made that participating in fiat currency is intrinisically harmful, that fiat currency and the banking system leads inevitably to more power in the hands of banks, and even war in a way that bitcoin doesn't *necessarily*.  So we should choose bitcoin whenever we have the option regardless of cost, if it is available.

I have run now 2 successful businesses without banks assistance beyond a basic chequing account that would have been easily replaceable via bitcoin(And in fact, when I shut the 2nd one down, my customers were begging to pay with bitcoin).


Try living in a country that isn't in the 3rd world.


Cars are an inherently unethical method of transportation that makes 19th century assumptions about the exhaustability of our global ecosystem. People should not own cars, and I don't.


And the vast, vast majority of loans are predatory, and we shouldn't put up with a society that supports their existence.


And so, too will DACs if absolutely need be.  Again: this is the sort of thing that your wristwatch will be able to do in the not to distant future.


It's risky now because our data isn't very redundantly stored.  We've solved the data redundancy problem though, it's just a matter of time before it's pushed out to the edge devices.
 


Those companies, too, will wash away with time: but in the meanwhile they will continue to compete with banks for more of their business until the banks are ground into fine sand.

Not /s.  You get ^log 2 ^(6) bits per roll.  In general if there are ^N possible outcomes that are distributed among themselves fairly, the number of bits of entropy you get from that outcome is ^log 2 .^(N).  You don't have to throw away the extra ^log 2 ^(6) ^-2 bits for every roll, but it certainly makes it easier to count.  A bit is just a value that can take one of two values, 0 or 1.  This means that if you have B bits, there are 2^B possible outcomes that it represents.  ^2 ^^.(log ^2 ^^2^^^N ^^.) is ^N.

Yes, bitcoin is doing well -- and that should be celebrated.  But there are literally billions of unbanked and underbanked people to go around yet, and the people at StellarOrg and Ripple Labs, nevermind the broader ripple community at large is working on connecting people that the bitcoin community and all the companies associated with is simply unable, at this current moment to reach out to, period.  Banks still exist - we still have to work in a world with banks, and the inequality that they continually cultivate, and for a vast majority of the world we are not at a point yet where we can jump over the burden of both having no control over our lives and the tools and land around us(which are mostly owned by the banks), to having the kinds of control you could have with bitcoin.

That depends, do you want a quick, witty response, or a thorough explanation?  A thorough explanation involves the fact that the centralization of power in banks has associated with it inherent systemic risk, especially when regulatory capture disintegrates the distance between investment and savings banking functions, and the distance between public policy and banking profits.  It involves the understanding of deference to authority inherent in the kinds of social structure that the bank is -- we still have roughly the same kind of banks that enabled the holocaust, enabled and continues to enable slavery, and war, and have invested in most if not all of the non-communist atrocities in history since they first started being founded.  If you point at practically anything wrong with the world, any market failure, any injustice you can probably spot a bank nearby enabling the problem at a very close distance.  They have an antiquated, fragile system at its core that grows increasingly distant from the understanding of its programmers who maintain it, and it is used as an excuse to exploit, intimidate and dehumanize on a daily basis.

There's a lot of people who have claimed to have a 'decentralized exchange' -- [Ripple](remains the first to have done so, even if their attempt was very imperfect and offers only marginal gains relative to bitUSD


Yeah that 'feed price' is very questionable and certainly about as questionable as anything on the ripple network.  There's a couple of different ways that the liquidity could dry up and the value of said USD won't be worth a thing, and unlike Ripple these aren't as obvious to the holder.

Work is available, at [global wages]( for bitcoin..Its about 30uBTC for a few minutes work, or about 3 cents an hour give or take.   If you really need the work, that is pretty much bottom of the barrel stuff.  There's probably a LOT of things that make sense at that wage, from someone, somewhere in the world to someone, somewhere else in the world.  All you need is a free bitcoin web account somewhere and a way to interact with people who do not use bitcoin (say, use a local fiat currency or someone who uses ripple).  What Bitstamp gives you is a pretty trust-neutral entity to give your money to so that a lot of people could be counted on to want your money  -- ie if you have people who you trust on the ripple network, they may end up actually taking you up on that trust if it means access to your bitstamp account(or alternatively, people who *they* trust may have use of bitcoin, and may end up using your bitstamp account, and the people that *they* trust ad infinitem). 
Later you can make use of that trust to trade, in person for goods such as shelter, food and soap or even cash(all of which I've seen available for ripple, as well as bitcoin).  The benefis in tis situationt to using Ripple is that there are people using ripple who do not use bitcoin, but who do barter and who may end up using ripple to manage their in person trading.  You only need to have someone use a system that talks to Ripple, in effect -- which at this point might be every LETS in the world as well as a host of other systems that bitcoin will have trouble integrating with.  It is also possible to arbitrage between bitcoin exchanges/ripple gateways to also turn a profit while making the network more efficient, another bonus opportunity if you need it.
You can, if you have a steady supply of bitcoin, start to acquire stability in your life by the purchase of things as they are needed, even if you do not have a fixed address, as opposed to having to scrounge by without and rely on others for charity.

1) It's not just about exchanges but since this is I can understand that exchanges is going to be kind of the important thing
2) 50,000 or 50,000,000 nodes are a lot harder to DDOS or frontrun with HFT than a single exchange.   And so far the evidence suggests that the prices aren't that much different over the long run.  So I'm not sure how you could say it doesn't offer any advantage...it spreads the exposure to a huge number of risks over the whole network.
3) It is not centralized -- it is radically decentralized.  Any exchange is going to be able to integrate to the network, and indvidual traders are going to effectively become exchanges in their own right, similar to how any website can accept bitcoin, I would fully expect that within a year or so after it's released you won't be able to find a bitcoin exchange that does not.
4) Open source exchange software is great, but you're going to want this open source exchanges to work with ripple, otherwise they are going to continue to be the bottleneck for bitcoin's further development, and will continue to be illiquid, not feasibly challenging the gox in any way

If you have a ripple connection that is connected to anyone who has bitcoin on the ripple network who is willing to part with it, you can send them some amount of money which, if you have it available (say you have 200$), and they wlil get the money, and you will get the bitcoin if they are honest.  Similar if you were to pay cash for bitcoin, or bitcoin for cash.  There's other ways, involving gateways but that is the simplest  (By the way I have bitcoin and would be willing to part with it for a fair price).   There are tons of people with bitcoin on the ripple network so locating one is only marginally more difficult than finding someone with bitcoin in the wider general public.
As for TradeFortress's ripplescam, I would point out firstly that it is a biased source of information that does not admit that it is run by someone who runs a competing service - a predatory loan service of the kind that Ripple seeks to do away with.  I would in general respond by saying that there is a lot wrong with TF's view, and I've gone through it [before](


This is false.  Opencoin gave up that control when they released the source code to the server.  This used to be a fair worry (and you'll see in the preceeding link that people worried about it), but is no longer.   They took their sweet time releasing their source, and ripple labs/opencoin could have done this differently(test net much?), but the reason they did this is that if they gave this control back to the network too soon, and a problem came about, they would have been able to respond sooner and produce a fix quicker, while still maintaining the budding financial network's values.
Unlike bitcoin, which over years slowly grew to have real value within it(if you lost 10,000 bitcoin it was at one point just a pizza, after all, now if you lose 10,000 bitcoin you could probably have the person who lost it killed many times over), Ripple had very high values (hundreds of thousands? of bitcoin worth) or more flowing through it even before it was released -- however now that the cat is out of the bag, so long as the network rules are respected, like bitcoin, the network operates.  And there is a fair amount of bulit in capacity for the network to change the rules it operates on, like bitcoin, in the event of problems, only if the network agrees on it, like bitcoin.  However this network flexibility is substantially lower than before they released it -- because real non-opencoin/ripple labs people are going to have to get involved, just like what happened to bitcoin during the last hard fork.  It was a stressful situation of the sort that OpenCoin clearly sought to avoid, but which will probably happen anyway eventually, though perhaps hopefully not soon.
Opencoin does have a great deal of say -- they probably still run the vast majority of validators, the majority of nodes and of course ripple labs still has most of the xrp.  However even what has been released can run on its own independent on anything ripple labs/opencoin does, practically forever, with all the benefits entailed.  However the ledger is public, and verifiable by everyone, like the block chain.  If they start fudging numbers, people wlil know, it will be public, and you can bet your bitcoin that people will stop trusting them and switch to alternative nodes.  Unless I'm missing something.


Is not how the network works at all, and anyone who's spent time actually getting to know the system will know this.  Gateways, even at the very base case of users who do not care to extend trust can trade with eachother, leading to at the very least a series of star-and-spokes connected to eachother, decentralized heirarchical network.    It is unclear, given the amount of people who use mobile clients rather than full clients, whether it's even less decentralized than bitcoin at this stage of both networks, though that may still be the case.


Unless I'm mistaken, this is false as well, and at best might be an artefact of the current server implementation.  Personally I intend on writing an alternative server implementation at some point with the explicit goal of having a different model of the network which consensus *should stlil work with*.  Obviously I haven't done this yet and am a long way off but consensus only means that the lowest denominator consensus continues.  If you don't like OpenCoin's interpretation of the network...feel free to use someone elses.  It's open source, and there's already multiple forks going on, of which the main client/server appears to be the most usable.  In fact ripple labs/opencoin *recommends not having validators that are capable of conspiring with eachother in your validator list if you are running a server*.  That includes them and their allies.  This is healthy paranoia -  it is as if satoshi had said make sure that you connect to both his computer and others on the network in case his computer turned against you in the future.
Similarly, the model for how to deal with failed nodes/exchanges is *fundamentally different* than with pre-ripple nodes/exchagnes.  With ripple, the goal is to diversify risk so that you can assume that some parts of the network that you trust will fail, but that it will fail at a rate that is tolerable, and that as the parts of the network fail that you can work with them to get them back into a better working state.
This is completely different than, say, the current state of affairs where if mtgox ;suddenly vanishes without a trace, many people have significant amounts invested in them *with no way to recover any of it*.  At least if mtgox allowed trading on-ledger you'd be able to trade off ledger even in the event of mtgox failure, to some extent.


Is out of date, odd how he hasn't updated his post.  There is source, now.  It was designed as an open source project, and it was, in fact an open source project.


Ripple is not based on mining.  Ripple has nothing to do with mining except that it shares some properties of currency with bitcoin, and bitcoin uses mining.  This is one of its features -- that Consensus algorithm used does not require the use of petahashes worth of energy, effort and hardware to run the network.  It is much more elegant and efficient in this manner while still maintaining security, to the extent it has been tested so far.  The current version of Ripple is the result of seeing what is possible, because of bitcoin, and making it work without the effort, so that people can go back to spending most of their effort on mining.
tl; dr contrary to ripplescam's claims, ripple is actually decentralized, it does work, opencoin benefits but only to the extent they have added vaule to the world, and in general is not just not a scam, but a key part of how to solve problems the world, and the bitcoin world has faced without obvious solution, such as remittances, decentralized exchanges and so on.

Ripple can allow you to create value from trust [given access to the minimal amount of xrp].
If you can create a sufficiently dense circle of contacts, you can organize yourselves to be more productive than you could be without it.
XRP specifically there is one and exactly one thing that xrp an do that bitcoin can't -- allow you to make and maintain ripple balances on the network.

While I agree in principle that people should stick to bitcoin there are [valid reasons to fork]( ie, to manage the scope of transactions.  I think there are rooms for 3 'coins', excluding domain specific(xrp, namecoin) and region specific(a more decentralized mintchip)
1) Bitcoin
2) A 'jubileecoin' with intentional data loss every year but with very fast transactions (the idea being that it works mostly the same as bitcoin but confirmations happen immediately, with the caveat that the slate is refreshed every so often...how to manage getting money 'out' of these coins could be managed if it was predictable.)
3) A 'long now coin' for REALLY BIG trading spaces, like trade between parts of the [local group](

Firstly ripplepay and villages still exist still are in use while ripple.com nears completion.  It is the next major development branch and this is obvious to anyone involved in the [ ripple community](@_date: 2013-03-30 19:01:53


Currently, no.  That will happen, but we're not quite there yet[there *is* a client but it is not publicly released.  I myself don't have access to it and I am basically the canonical early adapter for ripple related things].
The first question is a little more difficult to answer.  Basically I have no reason to trust you.  But you have one of a few options
1) via ripple.com 
i) via exchange
Sounds like you've already got an account with an exchange, and have verified yourself with them.  This isn't required to use the network any more than using mtgox is required to use bitcoin but as you've found sometimes it can be the easiest way to get going.  You *could* just get bitcoin from the exchange, but what if, like bitfloor(?), the exchange gets compromised and suddenly has no bitcoin available?  (I suppose you could similarly say that 'what if the exchange gets compromised and suddenly has no credit paths available, but that's a different discussion, imho).  It's thinkeable that even if they hold no bitcoin at all, there might still be credit paths to and from them on the network, including to me ( rM1oqKtfh1zgjdAgbFmaRm3btfGBX25xVo ).


The idea behind the gateway is that the information is mostly if you want money from *them* [and potentially, in case the government wants to clamp down on them, KYC regulations and whatnot].  If you just want the exchange to trust *you* you just need to give them money.  While it is *remarkably hard* to get people to give you intangible, imaginary-like money for money that is tangible and hard [ie people who will give you gold for bitcoin, bitcoin for money, or money for ripple...which is not what most people would expect I'd think], that is what exchanges are willing to do.  
Personally I have only used the weex exchange, and their design gives me the willies so I'm not sure I'd recommend them for putting money into per se.  But whatever exchange you've verified with, transfer some money to them, via whatever means is available.  After you've made sure your account is funded, withdraw ripple credit, denominated in bitcoin or something like it, to your ripple address. 
If you get that far, try sending a payment to my address, and contacting me if it goes through.  I wouldn't recommend sending very much until you figure out what you're doing / verified the network is capable of what you're trying to do, though.
ii) via individuals
Similar to exchange but instead of just giving them money, you can get them to assign you credit in some other way.  This could be because they trust you for some preexisting reason.  If you know no one at all who uses ripple you're kind of hosed here -- ripple emerges in small world social networks when one person starts to try it, and spreads from there.
2) via  /  (trusted only) /  same as above only the 'exchange' option isn't an option.  You'll find there could be more credit available, in general, on ripplepay classic and villages, though (though that may no longer be true/ may not be true for long)

The long term price difference between gox and bitstamp is only a couple of dollars.  This suggests over the course of a year or more if you are willing to have your money held up that long, it is still probable that it will work out.

That's because the 'credits' (xrp) are purely a spam-defeating mechanism.  That's like saying that the mozilla founders have 90% of the copies of their spam filter, so their system 'favours' them.  Sure the spam filter system could be more fair, but right now we have basically 0 spam on the network, which is impressive for a decentralized system.  Don't treat xrp as bitcoin(ie as a global currency), we already have bitcoin for that.  Treat it as what it is: a spam filter.
Bitcoin has transaction fees that accomplish the same thing and amount to no less of a transfer of wealth.
Ripple has been a working system for years, however it has not been and is not yet currently fully decentralized in a meaningful sense.  OpenCoin is working on that part however.

It's not magic -- it's just how the system was designed.  Once you have trust from other people and trust to other people the network begins to manage that trust for you so that on the higher level.  There's technical details of how it does this exactly (involving avoiding double spending, making sure that the network is consistent, etc) but the important part is just that with time, credit shifts around, and especially in cases like yours, where you can effectively create a one-way movement 'valve' via setting the credit limit lower than the balance within the connection, it's just a matter of convincing said person to publicly acknowledging their relationship on the public ledger -- kind of like as if you could spend bitcoin you don't have and acknowledge it on the blockchain -- the important part is that it would be on the blockchain, the details would be worked out later but would be worked out in a way that is verifiable.  Only instead of being on the bitcoin blockchain (and spamming everyone on the network) it's on Ripple's ledger(which keeps the bitcoin blockchain cleaner) -- It's tripple-entry accounting, just like Bitcoin.

"nothing" is a pretty big stretch.  The US put hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars into the atomic program/nuclear weapons.  Someone had to pay the taxes on that(it's not *all* paid for by debt, and even what was, much of it came out of pension funds buying government bonds).  It has involved not just the scientists and engineers who actually construct them, but all the apparatus involved in allowing their engineering to be doable(they probably didn't manufacture their own slide rules), which means there's mining, forging, manufacturing, and so on -- not to mention the farming and trucking/distribution of material that took oodles of hours of labour to feed into both the engineering/science/manufacturing/forging/government administration, the teachers who had to teach those who ended up doing the engineering/science/manufacturing/forging/government administration and transport, and so on.  Yes the people who were into advanced mathematics and could handle the science were geniuses, but soo too were the people who made industrial empires, who lead social movements, who inspired people with their art that allowed them to percieve beyond the ordinary human limits.  
People in advanced technological societies like 1960s-2010s US might like to think they have nothing to do with the output of particular industries, but often they are interwoven in complex ways to those industries.
Your choices today are on the path to our species putting footprints on mars.  They will either increase or decrease the time necessary to make that happen, or the slack involved in doing so.

Predictions -- I'd expect some if not most of these to be wrong : no one can tell you the future with absolute certainty.
* 50% mtgoxRMB should have [most volume by that point]( and the chinese government may be still using BTC as a means of destabilizing the world economy into not using USD as a reserve currency.  Most new bitcoin users will be in asia.
* 50% If bitcoin has survived that long, it will have been functional for roughly 7 years -- long enough that first year university students have lived most of their life that they can remember with it in the background to some degree.  There will be an increasing amount of resistance to not using it and other digital currency from these digital natives that the boomers will still be trying to ignore but having a lot of trouble.
* 45% expect some discussion about bitcoin in the US presidential election candiates.  Possibly [talk of banning it outright]( restricting the internet/mobile platforms further, and/or detaining those who use it.  Depends how the previous few years go.  
* 95% Gold is predicted to be worth roughly [1420$/oz]( which is slightly higher than today, and also suggests practically no $ inflation.  Hard to say what that'll be in BTC, but if there's some betting on long-term inflation that does not materialize that will put downward pressure on the price.
* 90% The Trans Pacific Partnership will have been signed by then, but ratification takes some time.  Countries like Canada will have probably ratified the treaty by then, making it effectively a crime to have a computer that you control the cache/memory of/possibly owning debugging tools.  This will probably be a minor annoyance to bitcoin users but will be a lot darker of a cloud than it is currenltly.
* 20% Expect further, and fast integration of the DEA into the NSA's data trove, and a lot more heat of the kind we're seeing this year.  I think it'll take a year or so to get the wheels greased and about 2 years for them to learn the main pressure point is the legitimate businesses -- by 2016 however this should be in full swing and the businesses (bitcoinstore, say) will likely be in front of the supreme court, if not worse.  This may slow US usership but not chinese.
*  35% Since inflation does not seem to be in the cards, either interest rates will stay low (ie not rise to 5%) or the US government will continue to get loans from ...somewhere.  Russia perhaps?  Either way, the US will look more and more like an economic basketcase, something out of 1990s russia, so they will both strike harder against perceived threats against it that the public may not understand(ie bitcoin) and at the same time be less capable of taking on bigger threats(ie china) than it is today.  GDP may even grow, on paper though and it's still going to be a massive economy.
* 25% [CFIG]( will have been helping exchanges for 3 years, and Ripple should have had its server source released by then.  Exchanges will be significantly commoditized and easier to use by 'normal people' and easier to run by businesses, though government intervention will remain something of friction affecting the network as a whole on this level.  Expect some entities that you wouldn't expect, like Canadian Tire to suddenly become exchanges though not publicly talk about it, due to pressure to replace aging dialup digital payment infrastructure.
* 45% The blockchain should be what, 30-40GB by then?  Or about a thumb drive.  We'll still be mostly just talking about moving most transactions off chain and with the possible exception of &lt;=0.01BTC trades, very little traffic will have moved off chain anywhere.
* 95% More fibre, LTE-Advanced will have been rolled out in places means more places hooked up online with highspeed access.  Less excuse of 'but what if the internet cuts out?' holding bitcoin back.  More things will be smart enough to talk bitcoin -- more demand for developers and companies who are capable of integrating bitcoin into existing platforms.  Think the vast majority of cocacola vending machines(10%) that are being rolled out at that time accepting it or something.
* (75%) At least one more country, like Greece or Cyprus (I'm thinking Luxembourg) will need to be bailed out...spiking Bitcoin as banking restrictions and 'bail in' stealing of people's bank accounts is discussed, possibly bumping price up a little in the long term.
* (35%) You should be able to buy a robot that is capable of 'cleaning a house' with bitcoin by this time.
* (40%) Bitcoin will grow in popularity with very highly skilled individuals. (10%) Maybe a time magazine article around this time suggesting budding rockstar programmers to doctors will demand to be paid in bitcoin
* (25%) quantum entanglement based communication channels will be available for businesses connected to the right vendor.  This is something of a long term threat to some of what bitcoin offers -- secure, anonymous payment is probably going to be processed through these channels via non-bitcoin means.  However they are going to have weak points -- the players are going to be players you'd recognize today -- large companies with existing PRISM/US Government tie ins.

You need something to hold value for a long period of time where communication takes years upon years.

We can't store  100,000,000,000,000,000,000BTC[since it can't exist]...but we can conceive there may be that much value relative to the current BTC market [imagine when you can buy entire planets complete with functioning markets!] ...it might make sense to store it in a more long term coin that only the important transactions happen on and are only used for reconciling really large social entities [larger than anything we have around right now by several orders of magnitude] costs and transactions with eachother.

* XRP is not necessary.  No one is going to dispute this.  It's a new idea that's never been tried, and whether it works or not will inform the future.  But it *hasn't been tried yet*.  Whether it will solve the problem or not, in a better or worse way is yet to be determined.  We can argue about how well it will work but surely you'll admit that it could.


This is one of their motivations, no doubt but why does it matter?  If it solves the problem(spam) then they would have made something worthwile, even if they profit.


Then that's a shame, because the users so far remain early adapters and their networks, so you'd think that they'd be the first to understand this.

I applaud your not trusting of gateways -- that is a healthy approach to gateways imho.
If you don't know who Tradefortress is that is OK but he really should be a well known name here -- he's put a lot of bitcoin towards hiring people to come to forums like this to discredit Ripple and its participants.  He has attempted, with a fair amount of success, to poison the well before the greater bitcoin community could get involved.
The is a fine line between 'demonstrating a flaw' and 'exploiting large groups of people'.  TF has done the latter with prejudice(as Ripple would compete with his own predatory lending service) and has shown no attempt to act honestly within the system.  If it was merely about demonstrating a flaw he would havae offered to fix the potential damage he is continuing to cause, and to correct the misplaced trust, but he has done none of that, instead continuing to sling mud instead.

Despite its large costs the english did quite well with central banking.  The bank of england made them the most powerful nation in the world for awhile.

False, most of 'those people' have also been using ripple since before gateways existed -- the vast majority of my contacts have yet to migrate to ripple.com's implementation


Also false, I am holding IOUs to people I trust


I can manage my own risk, kthnx


...but the trust paths are still there, and that's the important part


This is not true whatsoever, and highly misleading.  The whole point of Ripple is to allow for issuing of your own IOUs that gain value to the extent you are trustable.  The network doesn't really have any value without this, this is its whole raison d'etre.  For example only someone on entire side of the ripple network need be capable of doing something worth .09BTC in return for the credit he's gotten off of me.  In order for them to 'accept' it all they'd need to do is explicitly trust him, which is not really that unlikely that someone, somewhere trusts him, maybe his mother or something, especially since he's benefitted out of the deal somewhere.  If he's used the trust of the people around him he's welcomed to discuss with me why this might be and ways that situation could be improved but I have no reason to believe he is in anything like that situation.  In short, given that he's connected to at least me and one other person, that's a pretty good indication that he's connectable in principle to a third, and that is the key to the network rebalancing, and he's about the 'worst case scenario' of least trustable people, just because I don't know him that well.
By the way, as someone who's been into free software/FSF for a long time I might seem overly harsh but I do appreciate your, er, purity of concern wrt. the software freedom aspect.  If I didn't know why they were doing it this way I would too be concerned, and they do need some critics on this issue.

That's because "Ripples" or XRP are only a side part of the project designed to reduce spam.  They are not the whole system, and they need not be distributed fairly.  Giving spammers a fair chance is not the idea here.  They aren't and will not be the valuable part of the system -- that is the users and their interactions with eachother.
This is like saying that all the connections on google+ are from google employees to other google employees.  Yes, that was probably true at first but...who cares?
So there's going to be some redistribution of wealth, it's going to be fairly minor


Their solution is 'consensus'.   There's a lot written on it and I'm not going into it here.


No.  Ripple asks you trust *someone*.  To the extent you trust someone, or a group of someones, is the extent that you *can* benefit.  If you trust no one you will not be able to use ripple, but be paranoid of your computer which is probably bugged by the chinese government, and go play with if you have to.

because xrp is the least important part of the system and shouldn't concern anyone beyond the fact it has to be widely distributed somehow? 


lets be clear here...that is not and has never been why I use ripple.  I have been using ripple since 2007 because I fucking detest  the legacy banking system and seek to grind their empire into a fine sand.  I use it in hopes of raising communities like north central regina and alphabet soup saskatoon out of inactivity and dispair and away from autarky and control by inhuman bureaucracy.   I use ripple so that my successes are built upon by those I care about and because I feel a working global society is possible. 
I have enough xrp to set up everyone I know with some and I intend to do just that.

Analysis ignores savings, and investment, and most economic activity involving bitcoin.  A single person buying a house or a villa would throw his calculations -- there's simply too many unknowns.  Of course he's going to come up short.    However the thrust of his argument may very well be true -- if SR is 10% of our economy and is only worth 2M$, the value may be 20M$ as a whole, not the 1.6B$.
I think the root of the issue comes with trying to estimate the value of transactions that you can only see is half impossible, and we're used to doing so in the legacy economies.  I think his estimate is a good one, but it's a *minimum* estimate -- a lower bound for value.  And as a lower bound, he's dead on -- if bitcoin falls to 0.30$ tomorrow, you should buy because the goods and services traded for bitcoin are clearly above that level and have been consistently for the past little while, regardless of other reasons.
@_date: 2013-04-23 00:19:38
Because vendors soak the 6% on the credit card payments out of their profit, in practice.  Paying with the cheaper method basically subsidizes the more expensive &amp; the price is pushed down somewhere in between.
However if an extra 3% off of everything isnt' worth it to you, maybe it's not worth it.  That is OK -- you're free of course to use local currencies which might have local advantages.  Not everyone exists on a global level.

You can also eliminate that risk by having higher prices (in BTC) to compensate for the risk.  In particular, your prices should be guaged on the window upon which your business operates (ie if you do a quarterly analysis, you should be looking at the quarterly average price, if you do yearly analysis (most companies do, it's called "tax season") your price should follow the yearly average(41$/BTC).  Or something between those two extremes.  You are not a market/daytrader, keeping track of daily or up-to-the-nanosecond price swings is just asking for trouble.
Still, 28BTC in sales is pretty good for a month.  Most businesses are not profitable in their first little while, and you sound like you're about to crack that limit.

You do not need a bank transfer to use ripple -- that's the point.  In fact ideally no one would use bank transfers at all, we'd all be using ripple instead.  At the minimum, you just set it up, acquire some xrp and trust some friends/local businesses [or if you're *really* lazy, go to  and just skip the acquiring xrp part].  If you don't have any friends/local businesses, make some.  If you're in an area that is underserved by banking institutions, cultivating a network of trust can do a great deal of good.
If you think this sounds odd, just consider: it is now significantly easier to get money in and out of bitstamp.net than it is to get in/out of bitcoin exchanges that rely entirely on bank transfers, if you're trustworthy enough.

The person trusting him and the person giving bitcoin to him would probably not be the same.  While he does need some xrp it can be obtained freely if there's a need(as in this case).

However he probably only need pay those middle steps in the currency that is appropriate; ie local cash.

Isn't it a risk that coins, like Litecoin (and at the current rate of growth, even goddamn dogecoin?) could get too big before an attack could be mounted?  That once 1M$ is available there might be enough computing backing it that it would take more than 250k$ at which point there might be too many higher ROI investments available?  It'll take time and training to organize such an assault that can't be spend on other activities, too.    Would it make sense to start a company on Havelock or something to invest in such a project now so that when the market is ripe that the equipment will be available?

"bitcoin user" is *obscenely* vague.  I see practically everyone using bitcoin at some point in their lives.
* Highschool students who are starting out with basically nothing can bootstrap themselves into division of labour by extending credit to eachother that will be trivial to repay at some point in their lives, even if they don't have bitcoin at the time.
* Ripple.com seems to be making a pretty good case that exchanges can use it to make it easier to deal with eachother and to balance their exposure to various currencies.
* It allows you to more optimally manage social capital in addition to financial   capital, and to make use of social capital that *other people themselves* are not using in an optimal way.   It solves one class of deadlocks that *all* economic systems including those governed by bitcoin are subject to.

a 2nd order system is a system that has terms of the form
a(x)y'' + b(x)y' + c(x)y+d(x)=0
the 'solution' to this system is a function y(x) such that the above is true where y' is the derivative of y and y'' is the derivative of y' and a(x) b(x) c(x) d(x) are all functions of x
There's a few ways to solve these, and a few kinds of these, one of which is 'underdamped', one solution of which you can read about [here]( which is to say
the y(x) in the above case would be ((1/(1-a))e^-bt) * sin(...) the idea being that it tapers off(e^-bt term) into a sine wave but starts as something completely different

This is OK. Those companies have input costs in USD sometimes very complex input costs. What it means though is that as their inputs begin to offer bitcoin as a payment option, they already have an income source to draw easily from and both sides benefit from the use of bitcoin for these transactions since fiat is a PITA.  Bitcoin will grow from the roots up and these transitionary days of bitcoin at the interface increases daily the size of the next biggest thing to hit the network.

[Not fully -- but progress is being made](


Bitcoin is an unnecessary hypothesis -- it needlessly complicates this scenario.  Ripple is currency agnostic and so allows you to send/receive in whatever currency makes sense to you.  Perhaps some experience with using ripple is necessary on both sides but it isn't much.  It's usually somewhat obvious once a payment has gone through what is supposed to happen next.


Actually it's ripple which excels in this area as it manages trust even in areas that cannot afford bitcoin.

(In response to the suggestion by the German Imperial Government that the US should stop munitions trade with Britain on the grounds that only Britain and her allies were receiving shipments of munitions up until that point in the Great War)
(copied from my old post:  )
"But in addition to the question of principle there is a practical and substantial reason why the Government of the United States has from the foundation of the republic advocated and practiced unrestricted trade in arms and military supplies. It has never been the policy of this country to maintain in times of peace a large military establishment or stores of arms and ammunition sufficient to repel invasion by a well equipped and powerful enemy. It has desired to remain at peace with all nations and to avoid any appearance of menacing such peace by the threat of its armies and navies. In consequence of this standing policy, the United States would, in the event of an attack by a foreign Power, be at the outset of the war seriously, if not fatally, embarrassed by the lack of arms and ammunition and by the means to produce them in sufficient quantities to supply the requirements of national defense. The United States has always depended upon the right and power to purchase arms and ammunition from neutral nations in case of foreign attack. This right, which it claims for itself, it cannot deny to others.
A nation whose principle and policy it is to rely upon international obligations and international justice to preserve its political and territorial integrity might become the prey of an aggressive nation whose policy and practice it is to increase its military strength during times of peace with the design of conquest, unless the nation attacked can, after war had been declared, go into the markets of the world and purchase the means to defend itself against the aggressor.
The general adoption by the nations of the world of the theory that neutral Powers ought to prohibit the sale of arms and ammunition to the belligerents would compel every nation to have in readiness at all times sufficient munitions of war to meet any emergency which might arise and to erect and maintain establishments for the manufacture of arms and ammunition sufficient to supply the needs of its military and naval forces throughout the progress of a war. Manifestly the application of this theory would result in every nation becoming an armed camp, ready to resist aggression and tempted to employ force in asserting its rights rather than appeal to reason and justice for the settlement of international disputes.
Perceiving, as it does, that the adoption of the principle that it is the duty of a neutral to prohibit the sale of arms and ammunition to a belligerent during the progress of a war would inevitably give the advantage to a belligerent which had encouraged the manufacture of munitions in time of peace and which had laid in the vast stores of arms and ammunition in anticipation of war, the Government of the United States is convinced that the adoption of the theory would force militarism on the world and work against that universal peace which is the desire and purpose of all nations which exalt justice and righteousness in their relations with one another."

That's the thing.  It isn't.  Lots of places don't accept cash.  Hotels require credit cards.  Dealing person to person you *can't* use credit cards.  Credit cards carry with them a 3% fee, nevermind the interest in carrying balances.  Vending machines usually accept coins only.   You live near a border and suddenly you need pesos or loonies if you want to spend your money beyond it.  
With bitcoin *all* of these things suddenly may have the same payment mechanism -- mobile networked computer to mobile networked computer, possibly mediated by a ripple server for speed purposes in a local environment.

Well please meditate on that.   I hope to learn from your intrinsic emotional reaction on this matter.

Bitcoin has shown us a lot of the path, and we are going to be able to hopefully avoid some mistakes [and of course the obvious; Bitcoin is going to bear the brunt of the US government when it strikes at us both]

Disagree. It should depend on what kind of business,your competition, your input cost, and the time frame involved. It is always better to have lower prices, but holding to long term average prices should not be looked down upon.  Current year avg price is about 174$/btc.

No, in order to gain any benefit at all from trust, you must trust.  If all you trust is money then all you will have is money.  Sooner or later you're going to have to interact with the rest of the world, and that's when trust becomes an important thing.

Just like Bitcoin -- at root, it is a system, not a program.  There's a protocol that is defining it to clearer and clearer degrees.  So what Ripple is...it is that system.


That's a good point, and part of the problem is that because there are different approaches that have been tried, it's even worse than that -- it's as if saying that b-money / bitcoin is a set of protocols for sendnig money over the internet and leaving it at that.  So maybe we need to get a bit more specific.
The idea behind the system is to use trust networks to move value around.  To enable transactions like the following: 
Alice knows Bob, who knows Jeff, who has an account at Bitstamp.
The price of bitcoin suddenly tanks.   Jeff and Bob are busy at work and can't really do anything but Alice knows that the long term price is really not affected by the recent news (say, a fairly insignificant spat about microtransactions in the master branch of bitcoin).  So she is able to use the fact that Bob trusts her, and Jeff trusts Bob to purchase Bitcoin from Bitstamp with their credit.  Later on she can settle with Bob, once the price has gone back up, and she nets a small profit off of the market's instability.
There's many situations like this we could draw up.
The question of *how* to make Ripple work is a good one, and I think what you're getting at.  But the question of *what* ripple is is a system that has these features, in such a way that there is no central authority determining who you can interact with, in the long term, that is capable of talking to similar servers capable of the same.  The latter part has so far proved to be difficult to pull off, but Ripple.com is getting very close.
The current, stable working model is [villages.cc]( -- which is a single, centralized place but it's missing features
 * Decentralized client 
 * Units are fixed to hours, which while it works for some purposes(bootstrapping an economy, trade with other systems) it is not useful for others(insert bitcoin use here)
 * Payments are routed via fixed algorithm, stored server side(in principle, once you have a network of people with assigned credit links to eachother, there are different ways you can route attempted payments which trade off speed, security, cost, memory, etc...its' been a goal for a long time to allow for the market to decide which is appropriate where)
 * No API/mobile/etc interfaces(the new instance already sounds like this is mostly working, see the [wiki](

Let's not beat around the bush.  That someone was the trusted bitcoin community member TradeFortress, runner of coinlenders and pizza4bitcoin.


"reputation on Ripple" only because it hasn't yet sunk in fully how much of a scumbag move this was to the larger Bitcoin community and how unrepentant he continues to be, opting instead to wage a PR campaign to hide his mistake rather than own up to it.
Let's say we have a trust relationship like this:
A &lt;-|-&gt; B &lt;-|-&gt; B's Grandma  &lt;-|-&gt; Tradefortress  &lt;-|-&gt; D
B's Grandma creaes a credit limit of 10 BTC and Tradefortress sends 1BTC to her for the trouble, creating a potential of 9BTC for payment from TradeFortres to B's Grandma/people who trust Grandma, and a potential of 1BTC for payment from B's Grandma/ people who trust Grandma to Tradefortrress.
B's Grandma is the early adapter in this situation, and Tradefortress is able to use the remaining 9BTC for his own purposes by getting a house from A before B's Grandma is able to understand why this is disadventageous to her.
B is not worse off, as although A owes B, so too does his grandma.
A is not worse off, as B owes him.
B's Grandma was wrong to trust TradeFortress, and is worse off for doing so, and TradeFortress is better off for swindling her, but you're right -- the reputation of TradeFortress comes into play at this point.  Now
1) Your problem seems not to be with the status of B's grandma but with the status of A and whether or not actions by B's grandma can affect A and whether A has to trust B's grandma.  A does not trust and does not know B's grandma.   A trusts B and so long as B or someone on B's side of the network is able to provide some future value to A (which, since A has extended him credit he either expects is possible or is ok with never paying back due to some external factor) A is better off for doing so and will remain so.
2) This means that while we do not have to *trust* B's grandma there is a social gain to helping her manage her technical and financial setup so that she is reliable in the future.  We all have the incentive to help eachother, especially those less technically capable.
 
The root of our disagremeent is you're viewing Ripple connections as debt.  While they can be used to closely model debt, they aren't really debt.  They are a new form of relationship that has different expectations and incentives involved. 
| Debt | Ripple 
| ----------------------|----------------------
| B's grandma must eventually pay B back | B's grandma may never pay B back
| Only B's grandma should be involved in compensating B for his expense | Anyone who trusts B could be involved in compensating B back for his expense
| B has incentive to extract his money out of grandma via any legal means | B has incentive to help B's Grandma with technical issues and get her life in an order that she is capable of understanding is better than where she currently is, in such a way that is less contradictory (ie to reduce Spread, Muddle and Distance between B's Grandma and a better B's Grandma by B's Grandma's and B's standard) 
| B has incentive to loan B's Grandma as much as profitable even if it is harmful to B's Grandma | B has incentive to expand B's Grandma's credit limit as much as the intersection of B and B's Grandma is capable of understanding the consequences of.


You *can* trust family.  If you can't trust your family, you have problems, but it's not uncommon -- many families end in divorce and family isn't perfect.  But it is worthy of some trust.  10BTC is a lot of money to trust and is an extreme example that should not be recommended -- 1 HRS on the other hand is a lot more reasonable.  Enough that if they didn't pay it off it's not a big deal, but enough that it is usable for something, and enough that it can be reasonably managed through cooperation.

It's actually 2 challenges in one.
Concerts are a *local* phenomenon.  I think implicit in *us* considering this we're thinking of internet people buying concert tickets, and having a mildly inconvenient method of payment.  The big gain for concerts is that Artists are global -- they travel, they have to cross borders and deal with hassles of converting currency and so on.  Local people have local currency, global Artists need global currency.  It will be more beneficial when local people give bitcoin to global Artists than it would for global fans to give global Artists[because we already can do that].
The local:global dynamics are not properly being realized and there's significant rent being collected facilitating local areas drawing and rewarding global Artists by the likes of the chokepoints[ie ticketmaster].

We can't see it in its entirety.  I think it's likely in 2016-17 when the halving comes that, again, the price will either under or overshoot significantly(probably under) as demand and supply is not linear so it's hard to tell, halving the supply, exactly how much the price should increase as the creation of new bitcoin to replace lost bitcoin slows. 
Also there will be a continual pressure whenever a government falls due to financial crisis for a country to integrate tighter with the bitcoin economy.  We saw it with cyprus and this happens about once or twice a year on average, usually in spurts.  In the next 10 years, it gets more and more likely we'll see that, and when it happens, there will likely be another more or less permanent bump in price.

When I go to 4-5 ATMs and they are all out of cash...is a debit/credit card *really* backed by cash anymore?  I hear in some places you can get "cash back" from credit cards in stores, but in places [like where I'm from] stores almost never conduct this practice...is it really?
Convertability from credit to cash is haphazard at best...what about the other way around?
If you don't have the right properties to get a credit card, you will either get no credit at all, or like me circa-10 years ago, a credit card with basically no balance.  You can get a debit card but there can be a 10 day delay for depositing money into it via atm, and often no way to deposit in person[as local bank hours are such that if you have a 9-5 job you basically can't ever actually go to the bank, especially if your job does not permit you to take days off].  If you're really unlucky, you'll be like me today, with practically no way to re-charge them except via direct deposit without paying fees.  And the bank, of course, can randomly decide to cut off access to your debit card for no reason at all [it's happened to me] leaving you stranded unless you have a way to contact them.
I'll admit that 'ubiquitous digital cash' is much more appealing to the masses than 'cryptocurrency'[hence, Mintchip is a big threat], but in the long run, digital cash that doesn't have their crypto shit together will face ruin.

There's TONS of risk, but I disagree that it's uncertain.  I think it's certain, at this point, that something like bitcoin is going to succeed.  with Bitcoin, however, we may have to lose our shirts to learn what not to do.

That's a pretty serious allegation.  Citation??


We do not *want* spammers to have a fair time.  Fairness is for the users and operation of the system where it is important -- in the trade of real value, via other currencies.  That is where the fairness or lack thereof matters, and what xrp is allowing as is.

Great!  Exchanging value by bitcoin is good, keep doing that.
It is a solution to many problems, though, including the fact that bitcoin hasn't yet completely eradicated the various fiat money systems.  It still has to interact with them, and this interaction can take the form of centralized exchanges or ripple-enabled decentralized ones.  
We can get into ripple's applications to smart property and whatnot but in the short term, there's a lot of low hanging fruit around -- hundreds of trillions of dollars worth, and Ripple is here to help the participants of the bitcoin network to take that from the central banks.

Which is why merchants should be accepting bitcoin AT THE LONG TERM PRICE.  Not the spot price, not the daily price but the price going to their expected horizon.  If you're selling widgets and you're pricing anything higher than the yearly average price 19$/BTC, you're taking on risk.   Hell you're taking on risk at that level but...it's at least pretty low risk.
Everyone's got an appetite for risk depending on their situation.   One thing markets do, though, is they distribute risk to those who are able to hold it more steady.
Some merchants *might* be willing to accept this risk

One use case of Ripple is these unfortunate situations -- although your family member may never pay you back  (ie they potentially would have an outstanding balance beyond you more than you currently trust them for and are unwilling, or unable to make amends 'manually') , that you might be able to make use of their credit to make payments elsewhere in the network, probably somewhere where you could not get payments to go through otherwise(at least without a zero-trust, global means such as hard bitcoin).  Once you do so, they could either end up with a positive balance with you or a balance within the bounds of your trust, at which point you can begin again the process of rebuilding trust in them, and helping to rebuild their integrity.
However the purpose of this exersize isn't purely to make you whole financially, but to get you working together with the part of your family that used your trust in this way.  Family infighting is shitty for sure, but infighting in some cases does not mean that families cannot self-organize better using tools at their disposal.

There's multiple ways of dealing with the problems inherent in banks.  You can, like some here on think that you can get rid of them entirely.  Or you can, like the statist proponents of the Chicago Plan, believe that you can reign them in via state action to exactly the level where they cannot lend into excess and no more/less.  Or you can, like try, to grind them into a fine dust by distributing their advantages to *everyone*, via easier and easier to use technical means, and the cost/benefits with it.


That's the catch here -- no one has the 'right to create more debt' more than anyone else here.  You do need XRP to have the right to make debt but that is mostly an anti-spam measure and when XRP are cheap enough[and they will be] this won't be of practical importance to anyone but those who write automated scripts dealing with ripple

The moment I can get paid in something that never touches a bank, is when banks are no longer necessary to me.  The 2 biggest impediments to not having to ever deal with banks are 
a) direct deposit from employers
b) ability to pay taxes via cheque
(with bitcoin, c) having more avenues for secure, easily distributable backup locations)
Having just done (b), and having just dealt with bitcoins over the course of a year I would LOVE the ability to simply scan a qrcode on my phone and have it figure out how much I should send the government and do so.  This is very doable and probably will happen within 25 years.  (a) will happen much sooner.  (c) is not perfect today, but as more people use bitcoin, this will become more common.
Bitcoin is not merely a 'storage' for fiat, it's a storage for *value*.  Long-term value.


Because you're still trading fiat for them, and valuing their worth in fiat.   Expecting short term benefits from anything on the order of magnitude we've seen with bitcoin is risky at best.  The long term value of bitcoins is, and remains slowly increasing as the network effect builds on the effect of people building things on top of it.

Yeah.  My first real payment went through in feb 2008, and I had found it in mid 2007.   Apparently [ripplepay]( is as old as 2006, and the wikipedia page for ripple goes back to [2005](  The original paper came out in [2004](
We've had slow growth over the years, especially relative to bitcoin [which I don't think is normal on *any* scale] but it's been slowly picking up.  Really it wasn't until late 2008 or so that it was useful at all to anyone and until this year that it really started to get to be a globally useful thing.
There is a fair amount of scholarly hard data on the ripple ecosystem at large but I suspect there has been no sociological studies on whether it actually helps or hurts relationships, on large, in connection thick networks or not.   You're right that I've got a couple of ticks for and against on that count but I suspect that it's not so much that it hurts friendships as it just changes the nature of your relationships -- you might find you're only surrounded by people you can trust, because otherwise why bother being around them?   But yeah, I would add this to but I don't think this is an experiment per se, just a survey or something of the ripple network, on a large scale, to determine sociological impact.  In fact I wonder if anyone's done that with bitcoin?


Then I encourage you to go without it.  You are highly atypical, in my experience, if you can.  I don't think I know a single person, online or meatspace, that has no debt and has not used at one point in their life some debt to accomplish some end.   Maybe one.  Debt is a tool, a dangerous tool and one that we cannot continue to trust to banking institutions alone.  They have not been responsible with it.  Just make sure you only use bitcoin, as USD and the like are debt-based currencies.

It simplifies things by making a lot of trades possible that were not before.  It is the glue that already binds a lot of different systems together and could bind practically everything else together, including paypal. Together with the ripple-bitcoin bridges, it's now possible for you to find one person or entity out of the entire network to trust   If you can find one single person or computer or node or company out of the N people/nodes/companies/computers on the network to trust you enough, and assuming there is a trust path between that node and myself, you can make value appear in my wallet.  In any currency of *my* choosing, and get bitcoin for your trouble.  You don't have to care about how or why there's a path from the person you trust to me, all you have to care about is that at the end of the day, I'm happy(have something that I desire in exchange for bitcoin) and you're happy(have bitcoin).

Storing cash is a bother.  You have to secure it.  You have to have a space for it &amp; keep your employees from walking away with it.  Bitcoin allows you to use that space for other things, to verify that it's being stored correctly &amp; securely (if you set things up right), to never have to worry about getting short changed (since the customer is responsible for paying exact change, right?).  Also cash is unhygenic, and for some businesses not having to ever touch cash would be an good few free minutes of work per day.  Those benefits are obviously not 3% though.

Indeed.  [Ripple]( isn't *quite* there but it's getting [close](@_date: 2013-10-18 12:50:41
1) First of all, Ripplescam is a dishonest attempt by TradeFortress to stave off Ripple from taking over his line of business in the predatory loan market by enabling people to organize credit amongst themselves more easily.  He has been wrong multiple times and has appologized for neither tarnishing the image of a decent open source project nor misusing the trust of hundreds of people worth many, many bitcoin.      Ripplescam is an attempt at poisoning the well, nothing more.
2)  The current Ripple network is the legitimate heir to the name "Ripple" and has at every step followed along the original chain of ideas up to and including its release of source. 
3) Hearn is a latecomer by the sounds of it to the Ripple community, I don't see any mention of him until this year.
4) XRP is not that hard to get though it always could be distributed more.  What is your address? 
5) 


You shouldn't accept xrp for anything.  What you should accept is currency that is meaningful to you (in your case probably BTC, in mine, CAD HRS and BTC, in others currencies closer to them) from someone who is meaningful to you.  This allows you, who has BTC to make a payment to someone who only accepts EUR, and vice versa -- Ripple makes the currency you use only relevant insofar as it is accepted by the people who you use it with.  
6) The best list remains at the old  site but there's  and for that matter 7) I fail to see how soap, shelter, money and food would not be useful to someone who has neither.  There are people on villages.cc who offer soap in and who trust others (and if you have a path to them can make use of that trust to reward them for giving you soap).  This allows them to continue trading with others (such as you say) and gives the person looking for soap some soap.  Likewise with food, shelter, money.  At the end of the day, some company got labour, homeless person got shelter, food, soap and money, other ripplers get other services and goods.  Trade happens, we're all better off.
8) 


There is nothing far fetched about the above scenario except it would take a lot of work that most people, especially those who are vulnerable, may not be capable of or willing to do.  But you might be surprised -- homeless people are by necessity the hardest working.  Only ibankers compare, really.  I have gotten food, shelter and money for Ripple, and soap is definitely available however it's just a matter of making it work locally.

People are often afraid of what they do not understand.  What is called usury was dangerous because, like fire, it can burn entire nations.  And in fact it continues to do so.


I made it through the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire and a couple of econ books on the topic[and of course, the old/new testament].  We can learn from their despotism, and the challenges that they faced for sure.  I'm not sure particularly what you're referring to though.

This is a great question that...was meaningful in 2010.  Or 2009.  Or 2008.  Today we have  whole economy built around bitcoin that would take a substantial amount of effort to dismantle.  It is that cost of dismantling the entire digital economy that is what underlies bitcoin, today.   How to bootstrap bitcoin is a different question from what its base value is in a day where it is flourishing and gaining traction so quickly.   The question of 'how to bootstrap bitcoin *into* something valuable' has answers too, though they are mostly irrelevant.  The 'root value' of a bootstrapping bitcoin economy is going to be something like 'gives lonely computer geeks meaning in their lives'.   Remember, this is the base case of a recursive, self-improving, exponentially increasing economy.  Like the original pre-gene replicators are likely not recognizeable as 'life' as we know it, the original 'value' in the bitcoin economy could very well be something that seems silly and pathetically minor in comparison with the near-trillion dollar a year economy we've got going on here.  Hell, even [Ripple](which is growing exponentially, and has many teams of people working on it, is really a minor footnote in history compared to how huge Bitcoin is right now and a lot of Ripple skeptics are probably right in outright ignoring it until it becomes something bigger.  Even if Bitcoin returns to anything close to how small it was in the start, its properties nearly guarantee that it or one of its clones will likely get just as prominent in about as much time, give or take.

You're confusing 'xrp' with 'ripple'.  'xrp' has exactly one purpose -- defeating spam.  If it does that, regardless of whether it approximates a scam, then it is not a scam -- it is an anti-spam measure.  It happens to have scamlike qualities -- but then again, so does bitcoin.  Bitcoin's scam-like qualities alone would be cause for concern but they are *not* alone, they are part of a greater context of what bitcoin is about and how it works, and likewise, xrp is part of making a greater set of ideas work.  You're right that ripple doesn't really belong in your list, xrp or not but I think you go too far in calling it a scam.
Ripple is positive-sum in practice, the only question is whether it will be worth the cost fo the xrp to use it.

An alternative to using bitpay is to use a longer term average price.  Stores do not use down-to-the-millisecond exchange rates of other currencies;  they take a reasonable estimate and act as if it were accurate.  Similarly for bitcoin; the long term, year average has changed over the past year, but it has changed at a rate nowhere close to the rate that the day to day or second to second change has been.  Currently the price is about 193$/btc.  If you price your product at that rate, the chance of it being worth substantially less for a whole year is very low, and more than offset by the fact that if you do make a sale your markup is effectively 500%.

The TPP is many things but it is primarily an attempt by the US government to strongarm other countries into organizing the world economy in a way that respects the US's role as the singule world power.  Two threats to its hegemony are 
* China
* Disruptive internet-driven technologies that allow other countries to have economies independent of US corpolitical influence.
The TPP is negotiated entirely in secret, with public interest groups being denied access (until at least fairly recently) -- it took wikileaks to come up with a draft copy, even.  The US has forced Canada to sign the agreement, and in fact forced Canada to agree to implement the agreement *without even showing the terms of the agreement*.  This is effectively a blank cheque on canada's natural resources and laws.  Other countries involved are faring no better.   It is broader in scope than NAFTA but the public of othe countries involved are being systematically excluded from knowing about it.
 
Features of the TPP to include
* Less paperwork on certain goods travelling across borders
* Mandatory DRM, mandatory US-lead surveillance built in to future core internet infrastructure
* Mandatory control down to the cache level of computers produced by copyright interests.  This will no longer be a 'slippery slope' to the kinds of things discussed in the [right to read]( ...this will be the treaty that makes that stuff law, and the next trade agreement (TAFTA) will clean up anything missing.  In general, it's going to lay the groundwork for even more rights to be taken away by TAFTA and and other agreements.
* more control of speech by corporate interests (think the kinds of BS the Olympics have been able to pull off more widespread) and less fair use in the US and elsewhere.  
* It is likely to be yet another chapter in the inevitable quest to keep Mickey Mouse from falling into the public domain by increasing copyright term lengths, in effect keeping the US from reaping the benefits of a public domain for another generation

It's not like they haven't described this in both source code and wiki form.
It is completely false that you need to trust everyone in the chain.  You need to only trust someone *who is trusted* by someone further down the chain, etc.  Two completely different things -- Ripple makes use of existing trust, that's the whole point.  Yes Ripple means that your rent payment may very well go through Jimmy around te corner who hates your guts and someone else may have a connection with him for a zillion bitcoins that are completely meaningless to you...but there is no reason why you should be concerned about what his relationship with that other person is except insofar as it is functional for you.  If you choose to be concerned about Jimmy you can create your own connection to him and manage that.
By the way I paid my rent with Ripple for years, long before OpenCoin got involved, though I've moved on to a non-Ripple community since (and am slowly trying to build a network here also).
It is not at all true that Bitcoin isn't suitable for the aforementioned activities, but I posit that Ripple may be used to manage the bitcoin.
Lastly, you absolutely select who you trust and nobody else with Ripple.  If you believe otherwise you really need to try it out and learn how incorrect you are.

...that is very interesting.  If you have a blog or something I would love to post even a very critical post mentioning this (or, if you prefer this thread) to as that is kind of big news.


It is a much easier thing to trade between people who don't know eachother, especially on different continents.  It is the universal currency -- I don't have to send euros or pesos ...I can send one, universally recognized thing.  Trust is still needed...but it can be trust between entities who trust eachother, on every part of the loop...the end result being that there's something to send.  And sure I could send the bitcoin itself -- but then the blockchain gets involved, and the intermediaries don't get chances to make other transactions happen because of this, and all the other benefits of being social in this context.


That's kind of the problem with these scale-invariant systems unless the benefit to the original developer scales down with the size of the network (and why would *that* make sense?  I guess now we know) it's hard to reward them at all proportional to the network's size -- and it's hard to ensure that the network *does* get big enough that OpenCoin becomes a multi-trillion dollar entity(though even if it did, it would have a roughly equal counterweight in the Ripple Foundation, and like Bitcoin, an increasing counterweight in the users who own the xrp both early adapter/non...so there's that to consider)
That being said, personally I don't have much of a problem with them becoming so powerful with the caveat that they actually have to earn it -- ie make the system work.  A world without central banks would be at least [1.5 trillion dollars per year richer]( -- that's without ripple-specific gains so even if OpenCoin managed to take that entire surplus amount, but crushed central banking utterly, globally, I would be OK with that.  I think we're a long way from that, but making progress.

IHBT.  HAND.


You might want to wait until the client is available before you do that ;) I can try to remember to keep you in the loop when that happens.
The problem with 'selling you' on ripple is that I don't really have any idea who you are, Koooooj, other than you're probably a [bitcoiner](   "General" solutions that Ripple offers are going to share some overlap with bitcoin/OT.  Off the top of my head though
1) Central banking is a pox on both of our houses.  Hundreds of trillions of dollars in value -- that's the blood, sweat, tears of continents for generations have been just lost on nothing more than keeping a legacy banking system complete with its marble foundations,  power dynamics and paperwork alive.  Ripple is something that bitcoiners can use to help overthrow that system and use the surplus to free humanity to doing something else, like [getting to space and removing existential risk](This is ONLY going to be possible if Ripple.com gets their decentralized 'rippled' client(or someone else accomplishes the same feat) and ONLY if valid it's free software/open source.  Otherwise we're back in the same hole, possibly deeper.
I guess selling poing  bitcoin is going to need allies, and to the extent that there are going to be places, systems and people who will be hesitant to use a cryptocurrency like it, some of them(barter networks, LETS systems, leftists) are going to be more amendable to ripple.  In the long run we face a common enemy, and should resolve our differences and figure out where to go next after that enemy is dealt with.
2) Even if you have a stable monetary system, there is still the problem of what exactly that money is used for and why.   One of the things that comes with *that* problem is the tendency of all economic systems, up until ripple, to get stuck in ruts that kind of grind to a halt.  This includes gold.
This is because because [Deadlocks are a macroeconomic problem](  There are 4 ways to resolve deadlocks : 








 and  have been tried before, and have well known limits and failings but Ripple is in my mind   And we keep running into the root problem, and will continue to do so until we resolve it and integrate a solution into our [value systems]( societies, governments, laws, etc such that we forget it was ever a serious problem in the first place.
I guess the selling point here is that deadlocks happen, if you don't believe me ask any java developer -- and then look at when our [economic system was designed](  They *could not have* predicted failings of multithreaded design back then.  We should know better, now.
3) It balances out deflationary aspects of bitcoin.  If for no other reason, bitcoin will be more stable for it, and it'll keep 'spam' off the blockchain and in something that is more prunable, and easier to keep rock solid.

Except that he would not trust the homeless guy for 5$.  If he *would* trust the homeless guy for 5$, then what's the problem?


Part of the problem is that everyone owed the same institutions, and those institutions had arranged the economy such that this was inevitable. 
It's true that there are weak links even in a ripple economy, however massively decentralized ripple-like systems actually appear to be more resilient than classical ones.  I will try to find the link. Ah [here it is](


There is no debt that is not backed by debt.  The only trick is that Ripple gives the control over who makes that debt to *you*.


Avoiding having to trust people is only one way out of the dillema.  Two others are to help them come through, and to distribute the risk.

Depends who you're in debt to.
If you're in debt to loan sharks, well first off wtf were you thinking taking a loan from a loan shark, second of all...this is really no different than what you have today.
If you're in debt to institutions there's this whole feature of civilized society called *work* and instituions love it when they have a budget to make use of.  This is a feature, not a bug.  [also they don't have to hire *you* to make use of it if the credit network is sufficiently dense/large]
If you're in debt to people you know...you can work together with them to figure out why it is you're continually in debt -- it is in *both* of your interests to figure out the solution to it.
There are already people who are not just one paycheque away from disaster --- but are kept away from disaster only by the whim of the ripple network.
I'm one of them.

If it is true you have trust on legacy options that is great and I encourage you to continue to coordinate using those if it benefits you.  Ripple need not replace all other forms of trade.  However the incentives involved do not to me seem to align for you helping your family avoid confidence scams.  This is a weakness in the way you are doing things, though not a fatal one.   The choice of whethre these incentives are worth keeping or giving up is up to you and your family/trusted ones but I suggest that it is a choice that either way should be seen as acceptable.


Nope.  Ripple forces them to do nothing.  Ripple is an additional option, and acts only upon consent and goodwill available to it.
Second, If they fail you lose nothing -- you gain from them to the extent you lose, you end up no less or better off.  They lose, but that is true of anyone who is scammed.


That is fine however there are many people with more than a handful of people around them that the sum of trust of which adds to a substantial amount.

If there's some uncertainty about price swings at your local national market ...then you should probably be paying more to cover the difference, as the customer.  There is some amount that you could be paying that he would not be asking these questions about price stability -- that is what the price should be.  Have your manufacturing friend consider - does he want to make 2x the profit?  3x?  10% more?  At what point does he simply say to hell with it and engage currency risk, however low?
If enough transactions go through he will see for himself that it is secure enough, and competition will force his prices down.  But for the time being the answer to this question is 'pay more'.

* Bitstamp owes you 100$.  
[transfer over ripple via a trade]
* Weex owes you 99.50$ bitstamp owes you 0$
[you pull in the $ into the weex exchange, find a good deal on some bitcoin in their [admittedly primative] marketplace, and then 'export' the BTC back into ripple]
Weex owes you 10BTC bitstamp owes you 0$
[behind the curtain]
* Weex owes you 10BTC 
tmg1 owes weex 10BTC
[you buy a concert ticket from tmg1]
* Weex owes you 0
tmg1 owes weex 0.
you have a concert ticket.
\2. Suppose that instead, you wind up wth 
* bitstamp owes you 10 BTC
weex and bitstamp have an account with sufficient credit
tmg1 owes weex 10BTC
* you would create a weex account
'send' 10BTC to their 'deposit' address
and then when that payment goes through, withdraw to your bitcoin wallet.

Sure it does.  If you are expecting to be in for the long-haul you should be ignoring price fluxuations in the short term.  If your business operates quarterly, using a quarterly average smoothing your perceived exchange rate means that the price doesn't change quite so much on you, likewise if you operate on a year to year basis, looking at things with that much context makes sense.

You do not need to *trust* someone's ethics to pay back debts you need to *respect* and be willing to help them improve them.


You're missing the magnitude component in this trust and that makes all the difference.  There is a level of trust that is trivial.  Quibbling over the ethics and best use of one satoshi is probably below the noise floor of anyone you might care about but 10BTC seems like it is not.  Somewhere in the middle there is a sweet spot that Ripple works best in.
Either way this response is a red herring, albeit a good response to whether or not a user need trust a gateway or not.  Whether or not it is in poor judgement to trust someone who isn't a gateway has no bearing on whether or not ripple will work when you trust them.

Pretty close.  You can accept payments in USD and assuming you are connected to someone who is willing to exchange USD for BTC, you can get BTC from them.  In general, if you've got payments coming towards you, your side of the network will be able to make payments to other sides of the network with BTC, if you're well connected enough.
Eventually there will be public markets (ie 'gateways') but those aren't set up yet, and if you look in the 'trade' section in 'advanced' you can see that there will be a lot more options too.  In the meanwhile, if you can make a payment for BTC via ripple to my account rM1oqKtfh1zgjdAgbFmaRm3btfGBX25xVo, you can get actual hard BTC for it.

Hey how much would it cost/take to make that work with Ripple?
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:34:45
1) You listed an *optional* package, which, if they were smart that did not get distributed to bitstamp and even if they have -- they do have to make the option of source available to bitstamp.  Are you suggesting that they have refused the source to bitstamp?  I've seen nothing from bitstamp to suggest this has happened.
2) 


But Bitcoin is a bit of a special case, isn't it?  It's the one currency that, pretty much since its beginning, the Ripple community has latched on to as a Free, Decentralized one for storing value and negotiating between untrusted parties.  And with hindsight it's now even tested with 4-5 odd years of serious beta testing.
3) People will have their life savings within the system, primed for OpenCoin to manipulate.
That might be so, but that's a ridiculous thing to do with your life's savings.  That's even more ridiculous than putting it all in a single penny stock, or spraypaint or something.  And yeah, xrp are going to have some value -- being able to use xrp is a valuable thing and I could very well be wrong about how valuable it is, long run.  As far as the OpenCoin 'manipulating' it, that much has been part of the design from the start -- working a way to reward the initial developers of any software is a Hard problem, and so far OpenCoin has employed something like a dozen people writing free software with their windfall from what they've got so far, and appear to be very willing to keep going on that route.  This is a huge windfall, *if it works* for free software as a whole

* Where do you store it?  Depends how much you want to buy/use.  For small amounts, use the bitcoin-qt client (available at bitcoin.org) or 'bitcoin' in the Google Play store.

Yes.  He lost a substantial sum in the crash and got it back again by way of smart investing.  He was a noted who's who of some of the smartest people of his generation.

just to clarify you are making a positive claim about an unreleased product that you are asking me to prove does not exist.
I likewise have an invisible unicorn that is omnipotent and claims you have no idea what you're talking about. prove that I do not.

You need XRP to do that.  Unfortunately there's a bug keeping us from sending you XRP.  That bug is apparently going to be fixed later today.

You've got some valid criticisms but sorry, ripple has been "happening" for over 5 years now.   If you choose not to participate, power to you, but it works in practice and helps friendships bloom that otherwise wouldn't contrary to your opinion.


Ripple is a *complementary system* or set of systems to bitcoin.  This is like saying that oxygen is better than heat in creating fire.


Ripple is backed by what people put into it, and I put my entire stash of bitcoin into it.  If you can make a payment to me, you are welcomed to have it.  That puts the 'value' of ripple at least on par with bitcoin, minus inconvenience, right away.

there was an economy growing around ripple before opencoin existed, and opencoin has not begun to seriously distribute xrp yet because the network is not ready

I think [thePiachu is the market price setter here]( but I wouldn't expect it to stay there, as there are a LOT of XRP to go around.

ignoring gox it is way easier to buy in most places in the world.  from mpesa to atms and quickbit it is no longer entirely a matter of trusting a single unproven company. 
as for buying there are many more good and services available including bitmunchies which closed shop earlier due to not enough demand

OPTION A:
Looks like you can get bitstamp through bitinstant.com [see the 'bitinstant' option under the 'deposit' area?]
are you in the US? by a 7/11?
OPTION B:
There's also an option to wire transfer money to bitinstant from your bank.  You may want to try that.  Fill in their form for transfer details &amp; hit deposit.

Who would put them in place?  Bitcoin is an open system -- you design your own protection measures, or choose not to.
In the case of instawallet, there isn't really much ways you *can* protect coins that you keep with their wallet.  It's a very trust-dependent relationship.  You only have the incentives to trust.  But no one was forced to use them -- there were many other online wallets to choose from [and distribute risk to].
Bitcoin can only exist if you have a secure computer, with sufficient freedom.  I encourage you to make sure that you have such freedom  -- the [free software foundation]( exists for a reason, and that reason is there are positive outcomes [like bitcoin] that can exist when we are, as a society, able to use computers and run free software that we can trust and verify on top of them.  Choosing to trust someone else's software on their hardware is something that you should only do if you have reasons to do so [convenience] but it is important to always balance the risk of convenience with its benefits.   Sites like instantwallet which did not allow you to build security on to a verifiable backend are not as good as ones that would, however making such a site is Hard, even if desirable, so we may yet still need to fund it.
The difference, however, is that bitcoin is the open system that you can trust to build on top of, on top of which protective measures would be meaningful.   It is the start of a secure, highly usable system, not one in and of itself.

better verify that you can actually get your money out of the one it ends up in in a timeline that works for you...mtgoxCAD will get you a good price but youll be waiting for awhile to cash it out.  Also careful if you take steps to preserve your security and privacy...some exchanges *cough gox* are incompetent and interpret security measures such as tor as evidence of being a threat to them[presumably because they are incapable of protecting your bitcoin]
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:52:48
Not that serious, then. ;)  Seriously though can you get to Canada and/or does hard CAD work for you?

You can use bitcoin instead of wire transfers to transmit money in the future.  This problem isn't a bitcoin one...its a fiat one.  Wire transfers are risky.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:40:23


There's obviously a tradeoff, and that tradeoff is risk for marketshare.


That is for the market to determine.  Long-term exchange rates do change but they don't change that fast, and when they do, we can usually see it coming.


Depends on the threat model.

Any word on my suggestion from last time these were posted?  ie now that Reddit is leading the world in bitcoin-accountant knowledge, have you tried to leverage this by selling this valuable resource to other companies (aka sending your accountants to consult for other companies who need someone who's 'done the bitcoin thing before')?

It does not.  Reputation exists between people primarily - localbtc is public but is but an approximation

All I know is that I look at the 100BTC+ transactions I made where I basically helped out friends for their short term bitcoin needs and weep.  Had I kept those, I'd probably have enough to buy a house or something by this point.  As is I'm pretty much broke[though I have about 150BTC saved up for tax season]


Not really. I still couldn't buy it fast enough...there was only 1 exchange in my country that I could use and they had a really low cap - 1000$/3 months.  I bought at that rate from the point where they first opened until the caps were lifted, regardless of price for the most part.

Strongly disagree.  The EFF should not be accepting bitcoins until long after the first case involving Bitcoins gets solidified in US law.  They will be what gets Bitcoin past the US Supreme Court, if it makes it that far.
It hurts not to be able to donate them [since I'm effectively "all in" and have donated substantially in the past] but their rationale remains valid to this day.  We might be able to afford the wrong legal precedent, but they are much more valuable as lawyers and activists than as an early adapter, despite these examples of people following them.
