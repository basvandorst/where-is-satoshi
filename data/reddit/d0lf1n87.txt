three things that will weaken USA.a)high personal consumption economy
b)high national debt c)high wages due to high standards of living. that's why jobs are being exported to China.True story, reserve currency status will not last long.writing is on the wall.

This is how America steals from the rest of the world. With its currency distributed all over the world, and central banks having to hold it as a reserve to trade with one another, the US gvt can expand the supply of dollars, it can essentially purchase whatever it wants from the world and finance it through inflating/printing the currency/money that the entire world uses.The Uncle Sam position is same as a central banker in a country who can print money with impunity to finance his lavish lifestyle.
