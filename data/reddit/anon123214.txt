Sure, but I'm not sure I follow the connection here. The question is whether making it a reputation based system would make it safer. It can be a default negative rating when you purchase your 'ticket' (so if you are arrested, die, otherwise can not make it online again it remains negative) and you can change it to positive once the experience is over as well as leave a 'review.'

Right that's one of the issues. The people who would benefit from this would probably not have the ability to access this. Getting online isn't an issue anymore, but if they needed to use Tor and Bitcoin that would be much harder.

From latin america to US the price varies by nation, from northern Mexico it will be cheapest but still a few thousand dollars and farther away, say Venezuela or Peru will be close to 10k. source: personal experience. 
so while most of these people are not versed in bitcoin or tor, the motivation would be strong for them to learn if something better existed. I'm curious if it would affect price as well, but my main interest is improving safety.

In my experience payment was made up front. I do agree that there is a lot of luck involved but I'm more concerned with how the smugglers treat their customers, rather than their success rate (though I think that's also important. Even though there is luck involved I'm sure some would prove to have higher rates of success than others.)
