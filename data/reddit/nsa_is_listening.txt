I agree. All debt monetization is is a flat tax on anyone who holds USD. They "print money" to pay off debt, which increases inflation. Therefore, any USD is equally devalued (taxed) at a flat rate.

This is not a law. It is an executive order. All they do is say how to execute law. They have to be backed by the law but are treated as law until they get thrown out in court.

It would be unconstitutional for them to haul you to jail for breaking a crime that didn't exist, yet. It's called ex-post-facto and it's right there in the constitution. If you look it up on wikipedia, you can see a list of the times they have violated it, as well.
