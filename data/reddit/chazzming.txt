That's an interesting way to look at it.   Presumably something like bitcoin would not be susceptible to government inflation.   But what people don't seem to appreciate are the lessons that have been learned from trying to have a fixed supply of money.  Indeed one of the major tasks of a central bank is to increase or reduce the money supply as necessary.  That needs to have some relationship between the production and use of goods and services.  The extent to which that is done well explains the difference between, say, the Fed's "quantitative easing" and some Third-World printing.    
What f**ked up countries need to do is work for a change in government and economic policies.   Just changing to another currency will not do it, and the idea that bitcoin would help is an even worse idea.   
As an interesting side-bit for general reflection:

You want a problem with the protocol.   Here:  Nobody tells you who arbitrators are; could even be some of the parties involved in transactions. Even if they are not, nobody tells you how they would prevent or even detect collusion between arbitrator and one party to get at the security deposit. Nobody tells you who decides when, how, and in what circumstances an arbitrator might lose his bond.
This is a take-the-money-and-run just waiting to happen. The wait is merely for the pot to grow large enough to make the scam worthwhile.

You really aren't thinking about this, are you?   Start by thinking, for example, of 1000 people making an initial security deposit.  All their deposits go into one account.  So where are your 5 transfers into one bank account going to come from if you are just 1 of 1000?
Sure, scammed people can always go to the law.   Even without considering the fact that the law does not have the resources to go after every scammer, take a look at how much the scammed ever get in the end.   What is the law going to do that will help you after someone has blown your money on booze, pussy, and the high life?   Watch the TV series "AMERICAN GREED".   There are useful lessons there for many.

First, I'd say it  depends on where your bank is located.   I assume it's in Ecuador where you are.   Well, I think it is quite reasonable for a bank in Ecuador to get suspicious of a guy who doesn't appear to have local employment and who keeps receiving large (or largish) sums from overseas.   That's good responsible banking.
Second, if you are indeed not engaged in anything questionable, and you pay your taxes, then I imagine you should have nothing to worry about.  
Bitcoin is not a "solution" because governments are waking up to the fact that bad people (criminals, tax dodgers, etc.)   are into it, as way to escape proper vigilance.     Just keep your nose clean, follow the rules, and you should be OK.
Good luck!

I wouldn't quite say that.  I can think of all sorts of examples, but let's just wait and see.


Well, what saved the USA economy in the 2008/2009 crisis was actually the government printing and printing and printing.   "Quantitative easing" is what they called it.   In fact, there is even a pen ink that got named after Bernanke, who, it is assumed,  must required fast-drying ink between bank-notes.  Go here: 
The idea that economic problems are cause by "too much money out there" is simply ignorant.   Economic history has taught us that a fixed money supply does not work, and indeed one of the major tasks for a central bank today is control the money supply, through both period increases and reductions.
The Soviet Union had a lot of  fundamental problems---political, economic and otherwise (Stalin and the nut-jobs that came after him).   And so too did the countries in the USSR Umbrella.   Forget those bizarre places.

Yes.  The FAQ says that.   But what is to stop the arbitrator from working with one of the parties to get and split the deposit?

Well, if you really believe in fighting the Old Order, with BTC as the weapon of choice, then it is surprising that you have still been dealing with the Big Nasty Banks.    As soon as you get your money, assuming it is not confiscated as proceeds of crime, the first thing you should do is put it all into BTC.   Then close your bank accounts.   Just live off BTC transactions.

@_date: 2018-03-02 18:16:17


Some simple logic, friend:   The mere fact that a supply of something is limited does not necessarily mean that its value will keep going up.   You can easily see that will all the other scam-coins that keep popping up.  For something to be worth anything, people have to want it, and chasing after BTC is a game that will die by no later than next year.

This is silly propaganda.   
First, if you look at the populations of the world, where they are, etc.   you will notice that most of the world's poor (which of the world's population) are not enjoying this Bitcoin Revolution.  Whatever is happening in Africa is tinker-toy stuff, and it will mostly remain that way.   Few can afford the luxury of unregulated online gambling.
Second, if in Africa you look at where the so-called Bitcoin Revolution is taking place, it is in places that have semi-decent governments and economies.  The best of a basket case (which is not saying much), like Kenya Nigeria, SA. etc.  Anything about the really crappy places, with really crappy governments and economic development?   Chad, Somalia, Congo?

Whatever is good about cryptocurrencies wil eventually get absorbed and put into place by governments, banks,  private companies, etc.  So, whatever success the cryptos have (beyond get-rich-quick schemes) ultimately contributes to their demise.

@_date: 2018-03-01 15:54:20

That could be the reason why it takes so long.  I have one of those "visa debit" cards, and it does have some limited protections, but I see it as just a regular debit card.   I generally use my debit card for small or daily purchases---smokes, beer, groceries, etc.---for which I would otherwise use cash and where I get to walk away with whatever I am purchasing.   For most other things, I use my credit card.  
How will it play out?    Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) taking over,  in any way, as a currency is now totally out of the question; there are way too many scams and fantasies being peddled to the public, and it will all come back to bite.   Hardly anybody will see much of this stuff as more than gambling tokens.   But in this gambling game, upright citizens like you and I can still make an honest back without getting involved in much of the criminality that is going around.

No, I don't have to.  Try to use your head on such things.   People who own stocks in companies like Apple don't go around peddling Apple stocks the way botcoiners peddle BTC.  My shares in Apple is a stake of ownership in a company that is producing things people want and use in their daily lives and are wiling to pay real money for.   
What happens is Apple keeps coming up with new great ideas that the public wants.  The value of my shares go up *and* I get paid dividends.  BTC has no real connection with any goods and services, so the only way for its value to go up is for new people to come into the Ponzi scheme.   Eventually, the pool of suckers will dry up, and only criminals seeking anonymity will be left.

First, you miss the most important thing: those countries in which people tend to have the luxury of playing with bitcoin etc are also the ones with the relatively stable currencies.  Therefore they have less use for bitcoin etc. , contrary to your theory.
Second, and by the way stop being the kind of idiot who generalizes into "local fiat in African countries",  confirm the former statement by looking at cryptocurrency activity around the world and inflation around the world.   Learn something by starting here:   
As for the silly idea that collapsing economies can be save by bitcoin etc., they do not seem to be aware of it.   You should go over there and tell them.   Save the poor, ignorant souls!

Let me stop you write there, Mr. Expert.  What I actually wrote was "e.g. elliptic curve cryprtography and SHA-256".   See the E.G.   That means, "for example"; examples of ways used to ensure security.   Using a a couple of examples does not mean ALL blockchains must use the example. 
The SHA-x algorithms were invented and have been widely used well before all this funny money came along and for all sorts of things ... more things than funny money.    Blockchains and many other things may or may not use SHA-256 or any other particular encryption method.   
And lastly what I was responding to was the statement that it is cryotocurrency that ensures the security of a blockchain.  Even YOU  should be able to see what is wrong with that statement.

With bitcoin and other cryptos, everything is about empty air, and money is made only from greedy suckers who pile in as the prices rise.   So how do we get enough incoming greedy suckers (what some people here call "new money")?   
Said suckers can come in on their own, e.g after hearing wild stories if new mansions and lambos, or they must be encouraged.   The encouragement might be in the form of extensive hype in all sorts of media, or it might have to be more robust (e.g. pumping).    Key point to keep in mind is that the pumpers and the suckers are actually in agreement: that is, it is a dubious activity, but we'll make our money and pass it on.
So, to answer your question, "happy" is not the word I would use, but I am OK with it; it;s how these crypto things work.    Nobody will make any money unless some clueless types keep coming in.   Should I be sensitive about the clueless types?  Not really.  Other than than the obvious warning signs, regulators, banks, governments etc. keep warning them, but they won't stop.   Some banks have even had to try and instill a bit of discipline by curtailing wild spending on credit cards, but the lemmings still keep rushing forward!
Tether/Bitfinex are a scam, although with careful trading they could collect the money they claim they have had all along.    Do I care that they are scam artists?   Not really.  As far as I can tell, nothing will stop the rush of greed all over the place.   And all the info on Tether/Bitfinex and other pump-and-dump types is out there for anyone who cares enough to do his homework.  Right now we are in a cyclic pump-and-dump scheme around $10K.  Why is it working?   Because new suckers keep coming in, no matter what.   Should I be concerned about that?   I don't see why I should.

According to the bitcoin zealots, things are really bad and only BTC can save the day.

What does this mean?
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:55:24


Nop.  One can definitely separate the blockchain aspect (essentially a data structure) from the cryptocurrency aspect.   It could well be that cryptocurrencies turn out to be the best application of blockchains, but that has nothing to do with the separation of essence.    


I work in cryptography for my daily bread.  I was referring specifically to the bitcoin-cryptocurrencies, which is what "crypto" means to most peiple here. Saitoshi seems to be taken as the "God".   Well, there is no evidence that he ever contributed anything to cryptography.


All that could well be true.   For the sake of argument,  let's assume it is exactly that.  And so?   Do we, on the basis that there is other criminality elsewhere, overlook the fact that the bitcoin-etc. world is now a a wild land of scams, unregulated gambling, and assorted criminality(e.g. drug dealing, tax evasion, and money laundering)?  You might wish it so, but here's the reality: governments are going to step in---and quite rightly so---and severely curtail this nonsense and criminality.  
Ohm don't forget that the reason the financial world didn't collapse is that the "nasty" government stepped in.  And here's the cherry in the cake: they saves the day by printing a ton of money (quantitative easing) and putting it out there!

This type of analysis never really helps because of the way they include conditionals.  Possibly, if, ... etc.  For example, from what you write, it is obvious that of we don't close above $11800, then we won't an upside around $17600.   So, what is the likelihood that we will close around $17600?   That you won't tell us, because you and everyone else has no idea.   As to whether it's head and shoulders or legs and feet, does that really matter?

Most people aren't interested in "purchases a lot of legitimate things".  They are interested in purchasing those things that are directly relevant to their daily living, and for most people crypto is useless for that purpose; just look around you!
Last week I had an interesting in exchange with a guy in Copenhagen (a city of around 0.6 million) tell me that "there are lots of places to use bitcoin here".   I asked him how many.  He told me 35.   35!  Ha ha ha!   And take a look at what kind of places they are.
A couple of months ago I was in Tokyo, which some people here thing is bitcoin heaven.   Good luck trying to find places that even advertise that they take BTC.   And if you find any of the tiny number, good luck trying to get them to actually take it ... many of them  have never actually had to and don't know what to do!

Wrong, wrong, wrong.  What really push up BTC was FOMO and misplaced dreams of easy money and instant riches.      People who want BTC to be useful need to understand that instead of creating and insisting on a narrative that is consistent with their fantasies but totally detached from reality.
If you look at Dec 2017 and now, clearly there is less wanting of BTC.    That will be the general trend, so, apart from general day trading with smaller and smaller sums, I'd encourage people to get out while the going's still good.   No need to the last fool standing.

Excellent response, overall.   But I especially like one bit because it clearly points out something that should be fairly obvious: 
Quite right on the response to "it's good for people in desperate places like Zimbabwe".   Other than the fact that cryptocurrencies, even if used would not solve the underlying economics problems, there's a more immediate reason: those people simply can't get into cryptocurrencies---can't mine them, can't use the little money they have to speculate, etc.   People need to understand that this funny-money business is for those with disposable income.   That is not most of the world's poor, which is why the funny-money business will barely be found in such places.

I read it.  Neither I nor most other people have the slightest interest in the source code.   Nor do most people have any interest in "freedom" as defined there; to the extent that they do, they don't mind giving away that little "freedom" in order to apply something useful.
Almost all people use very many things without caring the least bit about what's in the internals.  And functioning society at all levels is organized and works on the basis  that people willingly surrender some freedom to others and various organizations, e.g. family, work place, government, etc. Anyone who wants total freedom should go live alone in the middle of the Sahara or the Antarctic (depending on what weather they prefer).

First, I was responding to the statement that it is cryptocurrency that makes blockchains secure.  That is not simply not the case.
Second, it makes no sense to talk "Why cryptocurrencies will [with] a small hash power are less secure?"   and even less sense to think the hash rates required for mining different cyrptocurrencies tells you anything about the comparative security.  The hash rate required for proof or work may go up or down over time, but that is quite separate from the security, which depends solely on the encryption methods used.  The hash rate required for Bitcoin, for example, will vary over time, and the reason has nothing to do with security; it is solely to adjust the difficulty in knocking off more coins.

By definition, you can see trend reversals only after they occur.   And if the past was always a reliable guide to the future, only the really-stupid would ever lose money.

I read it.  Even with your interpretation, JP Morgan "worried about crypto and need to do better to compete and stay relevant" is a long way from "have joined the bitcoin community".
If bitcoiners are serious and are into it for more than just making a quick buck, then a reflection on reality is urgently needed.

Most people around the world have few problems with money controlled by a central body; that's what they get paid in, what they use to pay for goods and services for daily life, etc.
It makes no sense to talk of places like Zimbabwe.    Bitcoin or other funny money will not solve the fundamental problems of having a dysfunctional government and economy.   The other thing is that if you live in a place like Zimbabwe then getting bitcoins is already near impossible: can't afford a mining rig, don't have the forex to buy on an exchange, etc.

You don't.   Nobody tells you who they are.  Nobody tells you how they would prevent or even detect collusion between arbitrator and one party to get at the security deposit.   Nobody tells you who decides when, how, and in what circumstances an arbitrator might lose his bond.
This is a take-the-money-and-run just waiting to happen.   The wait is merely for the pot to grow large enough to make the scam worthwhile.

@_date: 2018-02-27 17:25:06
You mention some true things that bitcoin zealots simply don;t want to see.   Ordinary people are not interested in decentralization, anonymity, fighting governments and banks, etc.   On the contrary, their rely on banks and their products to help with purchases of goods and services, they rely on governments to properly manage national money (taxes) and to insist on law-and-order protections when it comes to private money.  In fact, people who get scammed in these cryptocurrency business expect governments to deal with the scammers!   The idea that most people will someday hand over their money issues to some fuzzy entities on the internet is simply silly.   
The arguments comparing cryptocurrencies to email and the internet are quite silly.  If one accepts them, one would have to believe that every new technologies must be successful because "look at what happened with this technology back when!".   (Of course, failed technologies are never mentioned.)   And oddly enough, these statements are made while at the same time proclaiming that bitcoin etc. are really currency that will some day replace fiat!   
What I think will likely happen is that if there are any good and useful features, then institutional bodies will simply adopt them.    And one thing that is certain is that more regulation will surely come, at least from responsible governments, and indeed it should.      It is one thing for a small group of people to play with their funny money, as long as only small sums of real money are involved.   But it is quite another to have a huge wasteland of unregulated gambling, scams, and assorted criminality (drug dealing, money laundering, etc.).    
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:09:35

@_date: 2018-02-27 21:44:13

@_date: 2018-02-25 20:51:51
Yes, but you have to admit that it is one heck of a brilliant pyramid scheme.   It will take a while to go to the inevitable zero because of the number of diehard zealots it has attracted and who simply won't see the reality.   
Right now it seems to be in a temporary "steady-state": every time it goes down enough, some people buy knowing that it will go up again in a few days when they sell to newbies.  But there simply aren't enough suckers coming in, so the "steady-state" is a seemingly endless oscillation around $10 USD.    The endless random punting called "technical analyses", accompanied with predictions of "USD50K/USD100K/... later this year!" don't seem to be selling as well as they used to (e.g. heading into the end of 2017).
Bitcoin (and most of the scam-coins) as mass payment methods are simply out of the question now ... people have seen the wild votaility and endless scams.  Not to mention buyer-protection that comes with credit cards from the "nasty banks", PayPal, etc.  but which doesn't exist in the Wild-West of cryptocurrency.    
Still, zealots are not called zealots for nothing.   The bitcoin ones too will go down to the last man in their bizarre business.

@_date: 2018-02-27 22:37:55


None, I'm afraid, and it's hard to see how it could be done.    That, by the way, is a major block to this idea that these cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin) will somehow replace the way we currently do things.  It just won't work for most people, and in other ways beyond the particular examples we are talking about.   One can imagine insurance companies that would sell "bitcoin insurance", but then that's back to "centralized" bodies and what-not.
The more one thinks of how bitcoin etc. could be widely adopted and replace regular money and its systems, the more one ends up with something that looks like regular money and its systems.  That, to my mind, is why bitcoins etc are ultimately a dead end, except perhaps as investments or gambling tokens etc.

Bitcoin would have to be more stable, be as easy to use as credit cards etc., have the same protections as credit cards etc., and so on.
Regulation is an interesting one: it would definitely help, yet the bitcoin zealots seem quite opposed to it.   
And then there are the the bitcoiners themselves.   After last year, most see bitcoin as a way to make money (the fiat money they claim to detest), rather than as means to pay for regular goods and services.
I doubt that there will be a big upswing, unless we have another major round of FOMO (driven, of course, by greed and dreams of mansions and lambos).     
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:44:44

So?   People need to give up on this silly idea that every new technology that everyone come up with will be like the internet or whatever other technology that has been successful in the past.   
If you wish to argue that BTC will replace the way normal people spend money in their daily purchases of goods and services, then present a direct argument to support that idea.   *"Lookie lookie at this past thing over there!"* won't do.   And that's especially so for something that is no more than an unregulated online lottery and a tool for criminals and perverts.

That narrative too is part of the nonsense.  What exactly is it that people get from drivel and misplaced hype? In fact the only parts of so-called "third world countries" where people even have the luxury of thinking about, let alone some small disposable income, to invest in things like bitcoin ARE in fact the better run places with reasonably stable currencies.   Take a look at the really crappy places.   You think anyone there even has the time for bitcoin?   Unfortunately that reality doesn't fit with the fantasies that some bitcoiners wish to enjoy.  
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:08:34




Not quite; the profit would depend on my initial purchase price.   Say, I bought a couple of months ago at $15000.   I now sell at $11000, like you say, and then buy back at $9200, as you say.   How much "profit" is that?








And how many of those people lose money every single day?    Anyway, it's probably those people in the big traders, hedge funds, banks who might find your technical analysis useful; I don;t see much market for it in places like this one. Of course, if you can show us that you are making big bucks with it, then it would be a different story.

When I talk about not being in a position to get into it, that's not what I mean.  Suppose someone there out there wants to get BTC.   Are they going to mine it on their cell phone?  I don't think so.   Are they going to use the few dollars (equivalent) per day that that they depend on their daily survival? I don't think so. 


Soaring is relative.  If you go from 10 people to 20 people, that's a while 100% increase, but it's still only 20 people.   These stories are  near-useless and largely meaningless, except perhaps in their possibility to generate some hype and possibly some FOMO.

OK.   Yep, that's it.   Another case to think of is what happens if an exchange collapses (Mt. Gox style).   With the "nasty" banks and governments, I have some insurance.   With the cryptos?
Like most people I have have my issues with government and banks, but none of them are of an order that will make me transfer my finances to some vague, decentralized entity on the internet.   And it will stay that way until bitcoin etc. can offer more than some fuzzy words.   I see and use bitcoins as no more than side-investments/gambling-tokens.

change your bank or stop funny purchases.  most people who use credit cards rarely have those problems.   
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:32:42


That's not going to happen.   First, crypto cannot offer many things that real money (through, say, credit cards) offer.   E.g., if you get scammed on a crypto purchase, to whom do you turn for redress?   Perhaps sa small thing to bitcoin zealots, but to most people such things matter more than decentralized and anonymous,  and fighting governments and banks, total freedom, etc.   In fact, the reality is that while people will always  have complaints against governments and banks and want total freedom, the reality is that in civilized countries rely on governments and banks, don't care to fight them, and are willing to give up some freedoms in order to have a civilized society.   Just look at how people who have been scammed in cryptos run to government institutions and scream *"Do something!  You should have done something!"*
Second, there will be major changes coming to the world of crypto, but they won't be of the the type that the true believers imagine.   For some time governments and institutions charged with maintaining financial law-and-order have been cryptos an easy pass, on the assumption that it was just a bunch of geeks fooling around with their toy play-money.    That is no longer possible, nor is it appropriate: we now have a wild wasteland of perverted greed, unregulated gambling, huge scams, and assorted criminality.   There has to be some crackdown (however mild) and an imposition of some order.
What crypto zealots need to do is take a break from their computers and take a look at the world around them.   That will reduce the harshness of the inevitable adjustment to reality.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:40:18
Sorry.   "Decentralization" is not dependent on "proof of work"; there is already so much decentralized stuff out there, that I really should not have to explain that one.    Likewise, "immutability" does not depend on "proof of work"; it depends solely on the encryption protocols and how they are used; that is why, for example, we have secure digital signatures and so much more.  In fact, for just ensuring immtability, it is not necessary to run SHA-256 a zillion times, which pretty much what miners do; running SHA-256 just once should be good enough.     
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:22:36

@_date: 2018-02-28 19:06:31
My being new here has nothing to do with my understanding of encryption, which is actually one of my specialities.  


Nonsense.   The security used in bitcoin are a standard elliptic curve and SHA-256, both of which are very well known.   How is the security of either ever changed at any time.   The only thing that happens in mining is that the number of times SHA-256 has to be run is changed in order to change the mining difficulty.   But that has nothing to do with the security of SHA-256; for security it suffices to run it just once or twice.   That's what other uses of SHA-256 do for security and, by the way, those other applications are very many and have nothing to do with cryptos.


More nonsense.  And who said anything about blockchains without cryptographic keys? The security of a blockchain does not come from the token.   Cryptographic  keys do not require tokens of any sort; they just require an algorithm that generates them for encryption and decryption.

Interesting question.   A basic question first: if a person gets tortured into handing over their bitcoins, where does he go to file a claim for a reversal and what does he offer as proof of a crime?
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:07:40
Can't be the real world then. Small community somewhere in the EU, eh? Of course, you can't tell us where, because we could then check and expose the bogus claim!
Anyone can make his own money, even by just printing it on paper. , and control it.   But it will be absolutely useless if the only thing that is being done with it is holding it.     
Real money is that stuff that keeps bitcoiners crazy when they look at the value chart---BTC/USD, BTC/EUR. etc.  And what bitcoiners really hope for is that they can unload their BTC onto some sucker in exchange for the real money.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:50:37
I don't think it has to do with what people love.   The reason I prefer to use my credit cards, instead of bitcoin, for purchases has nothing to do with love.

Mumbo-jumbo.   How about this, which anyone can understand and actually see: the numbers today, generally $10.5K+, suggest $11K as a possibility.   (No need to get in heads and shoulders and legs and feet.)   What could happen after that is unclear.   It could go as high as $17.4K (a random guess) or it could go as low as $9.28K (another random guess).   If it starts to go down, then it coule even go down to $7.8K-8K (just random guesses too).

Possible, but that's not how I see it.  Hopes have really gone up since the autumn, so near-nothing would be a total disaster.   Would definitely scare away the sheeple to be be fleeced.   Even just "well above near-nothing" would not be good enough.   Think about this: middle of last year $4K would have been considered great.   Now, after the mad rush of the autumn?   A total disaster.    Lessons have been learned from the dip to $6K.
The lemmings, if their attention is to be maintained, cannot handle any huge drops any time soon.   Things have to be steady for a while, and never near-zero (total death!).   I like the current steady oscillation up and down around $10K; anyone who grew up on a farm will tell you about the "gentle" tricks in luring a chicken or whatever to be slaughtered for a Big Dinner.    Maintain that for a while, and then it will definitely be time to clean up with a "big tech announcement".   Key: steady around $10K for some time and then a "major announcement" is more credible; slip to near-zero, and they are all gone after losing all their lunch money.   
This thing is now like a religion to some.  As with all religions, the key is to keep hope alive.

I was responding to the claim that the security of a blockchain comes from a cryptocurrency.


 &gt; but without a million computers enforcing the network, it’s 




I was responding to the claim that a blockchain necessarily needs cryptocurrency.  Not.   Anyone can create one and use it however.
"Enforcing the network"?   Once you have understood that "blockchain" can be separated from "bitcoin" (and "cryptocurenncy"), you will have your answer.    If you allow Google to be your friend, you will find many applications of blockchains that do not need "a million computers enforcing the network".


Bitcoin was the first and has attracted a near-cult-like group of followers.   Could that be a reason?    
Whatever the reason, my point, which I thought was well-known, is that blockchains can be implemented and used independently of bitcoin (or any other scam-coin).   Which part of that do you disagree with and why?


Huh?  For encryption something like bitcoin uses a standard a standard and well-known elliptic curve and SHA-256.  The security provided by those is determined solely by the mathematics of the encryption, not hash-rate or miners or whatever.   Please explain to that mathematics can be affected by hash-rate and miners and whatever.    You may point to specific parts of the algorithms and how they are affected.  




Exactly.   Thank you.   And one can use that ledger (aka blockchain) without involving tokens or funny money






On second though, perhaps you lost me.   When you say "just a ledger and keys to modify their values", why can those for the ledger keys not be crytographic keys, and why can't the modification be done in real time?   
Summary: the beneficial technical aspects of a blockchain can be implemented without getting cryotocurrency and other funny money involved.   What's more people are already doing that.  That's all.

You miss a very important side of the equation: for the customers, once they see "accepted"/"approved", they are done; the settling delay between merchant and bank does not concern them.
It is not just a matter of merchants accepting anything, customer acceptance is critical, and for customers speed of transactions is as above.   Bitcoiners need to understand this instead of using spurious arguments to try and counter reality.

Please note that what I was responding was about an alleged "reduction of encryption security".   Double spending (and any issues associated with it) has nothing to do with that (i.e. the security of the encryption algorithms).

Let me try one more time: my main point was that it is possible  to have blockchains that have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies.    The "private vs. public" is irrelevant to that, and you have actually helped support my argument, with your examples of "permissioned blockchains".   Yes, you definitely helped me there!
Now you add that 


As far as I can tell, the "private" blockchains have been devised for uses that are different from the funny-money (and other "public blockchains").   So it makes little sense to talk of the "superior advantages" of the latter type over the former.   (Are dress shoes superior to running shoes?   To whom and in what circumstances?)  what should matter is that a blockchain is good at what it is supposedly intended to be used for.

It will all inevitably end in tears, with the bag-holders gnashing their teeth and wiling about how the supposedly-detested regulators and governments and banks should have done something (and something more than just warnings), but not for a while yet.

@_date: 2018-02-25 21:26:20

As to fraud, it is all very well to have "proof of payment", but what does one then do with in it, say, a case of fraudulent non-delivery.  Just waiting for some eventual and unknown some repercussions is not very comforting.

Yes, and one doesn't need TA to know that making a profit requires that you sell higher than you bought.


That was your figure, explaining to me how I could make a profit of 3800.




Again, meaningless jargon.   I could take any two pairs of numbers and it would work, e.g. buy in around $8500 and sell around $11000.   Whether $8200 and $8900 and Fibonnaci or Giuseppe or Pizerria is completely useless information if we don't have any idea of when or even if we might reach those figures.   And similarly for the $12000-122000.    In the absence of further information, you might just say buy when you feel it's really low, wait for it to go up, then sell when you feel it's really high.   None of which requires TA.

Sorry.   A blockchain is just a distributed ledger.   Which part of that necessarily requires a "value Token"?
One more time, I never stated anything like "blockchain good, bitcoin bad".  What I said is that "blockchain" can be separated from bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) and used quite separately. So, people should not get overly excited at an "endorsement" of blockchain.   Kindly read all of that again.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:06:30


They might indeed be better of; who knows.   Nevertheless, the point is that it is still a blockchain.  And it can be successful for reasons that have nothing to do with why bitcoin has been "successful".  There is no reason why every blockchain, regardless of intended use, must be evaluated with respect to bitcoin.

Your first sentence higlights my point about the need to not confuse "blockchain" and "bitcoin" (or any other cryptocurrency).  Of course, bitcoin isn't simply about the ledger, but a blockchain is quite separate from how it is actually used, and there are many uses that have nothing to do with any sort of cryptocurrency.  Let me try and put it another way: Yes, as you say, "the ledger is only one part" of the bitcoin mechanism; but it is a distinct part, and one can use such a ledger independently of bitcoin or any cryptocurrency.   What's more, many are doing exactly that.
Also, "proof or work", "no centralization for verification", etc. are also things that can be done, and are being done elsewhere, without involving bitcoin or any cryptocurrency.
Take some time and really try to understand what a blockchain is; find good material and read it without too much bitcoin in your head.
By the way, you have a funny idea of what makes anything valuable as a currency.   According to your criteria, all the thousands of scam-coins out there must be very valuable indeed!   
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:07:10
Not really.   Pushing it down too far would scare too many people away.   The idea now is to pump to near 11K, dump and let it drop, lure in more suckers at around 9K, repeat.   Money is being made in this endless oscillation between 9K and 11K.   And it will go on for a while.

I made around $2000 in day trades last week.    All depends on your starting point and how you play the game.




That's pretty funny considering that the basis of your argument is how much you lost in real money ($s).   If it's bitcoin that matters and you have those, why concern yourself with $s?    And guess what happened during the last economic crisis, as people like Bernie Madoff found to their great pain?

Two-part answer:
1. Take a look at what the US government did to the Swiss banks and their "stonewall, centuries-old" secrecy.
2.  Keep in mind who really owns Hong Kong and said Owner's attitude to these funny-money scams.
Tether/Bitfinex better have cash-in-the-bank real soon, and especially to show Uncle Sam, or they are in for a major screwing.    Of course, all that is good for us: when they make money from pumping, so do we (at least those who are wide-awake).

This is going to come as a surprise for you, but bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.   What's more, other than "was first!", there is nothing about bitcoin that cannot be reproduced, perhaps even in a better form, in other cryptocurrencies.  The major difference between bitcoin and other cryptos is that the former has attracted a small group of die-hard groupies as well as a large group of gamblers hoping to unload (at a great profit) their funny money to unsuspecting newcomers.   But those are not differences that one should make a big deal of in public.

This simply makes no sense.  Yes you can but more coins cheaper and thus end up with a lower average price.   But you are still out of the initial $17K plus whatever you spent on the new coins, and the only way to break even and get ahead is to sell at a price that gets back the $17K plus the new expenditure.   A lower average price does not mean you are out less money.
Here is an even simpler view: People who bought at $17K did so in the believe that the price would keep going up, up, up.   I doubt that any see falling prices as a great opportunity.   
Falling prices are great if you have already sold at a profit and are looking to replenish your stock, with the hope that it will again go up and you can sell at a higher price or if you shorted and are looking to fulfill the obligations or if this is an initial entry and are looking to profit later.  Otherwise falling prices are simply bad, which is why many here think the sky is falling in whenever they see a dip.

We didn't hit that low, so we can take it as a definite sell moment?   What on earth does that say?   One can take any low that we didn't hit at a particular time and say that was a definite sell moment for that particular time!  E.g. in you case you could just as well take 8800 or 8500 or ...








Whether or not it is a good idea to sell at 10950-11000 depends on how much I bought for.   Right now I can't buy at 9200, so it makes no sense to tell me that I would make 3800 with two trades that depend on an impossibility.  Other than that, it doesn't require technical analysis to know that if you buy at 9200 and sell at 10950-11000 you will make a profit.   




And where do these figures come from?   Why not, e.g., $8000-8500?   And what's the point of saying buy ... $12000-12500 when there is not the slightest idea of when it will get there or even if it will get there? Ans even then, why not $11500-12000, or $12500-$13000, or some other random pair of numbers .

Money is one the  most important things that any government controls; that is why tax evasion is a very serious crime even in the "Land of The Brave and The Free".    If a small number of people choose to create and play around with some private funny money, then why not.  But to believe that governments will keep looking aside when serious money is involved, innocent citizens are getting scammed, criminals are having a ball ... is simply naive.  Or just stupid.

Still at it with the meaningless conditionals.   If, if, if.     You still don't answer the critical question on your first analysis: what is the likelihood of the $11800?   Can you answer that directly?
Actually anyone just taking a simple look at the recent prices can guess that we aren't likely to go much below $9000 any time soon, and $11000 is around the top for some time to come.   So, this legs and shoulders and heads really don't say much.

Things are relative: to some people $100 is a huge amount, to some people $10K is peanuts.   Everyone has an equal right to weep according to how badly they will feel their particular loss, and, generally everyone has some right to weep when things go down, because everyone is hoping to profit by unloading to late-arrival suckers.

Depends on what you mean by adopting.  If it means perpetuating greed, gambling, scams ..., then, yes; but the regulators will surely reduce the appetite.  If by adopt you mean use as a currency, e.g. for routine payment of goods and services, that is now never going to happen with bitcoin.  (I exclude the diehard zealots who know of a store that takes bitcoin, know a guy who's lived off it for years, etc.).

That may all well be true, that they are considered "significant inventions".  But take a look at the history of technology and note how many things have been considered significant but ultimately went nowhere.  Some, in retrospect, are even considered as serious ignorance or bad jokes.  As for blockchain, it may have some major value outside cryptocurrencies, but, despite the hype, that is yet to be seen.   


That is how the crypto zealots wish to see it.   The reality is that the crypot world has grown from a bunch of geeks playing with their toy money, which could be ignored, to a wild land of scams, unregulated gambling, and assorted criminality(e.g. drug dealing, tax evasion, and money laundering).   And many upright citizens are being taken in .. getting into debt because they will supposedly become zillionaires in just a couple of months.   Action is required.

You add that:


Why not below 11000?  By the way, just look at trends in the last few days, I would guess that it likely won't go much above 11000 soon and it likely won't go much below 9500 soon.  So without technical analysis, I'd plan to sell close to 11000 and hope to buy later around 9500.

Your comment is very suspicious.  What are you up to?

Huobi for one, I think.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:55:11
You are quite right.  I missed that one.  
What do you think of this one:
*For example, if you live in Shanghai and you want to buy some bitcoins, you can log on LocalBitcoins where you might find some sellers in China willing to sell some bitcoins and accept Alipay as a payment method. You decide to buy from that guy and you send money to him using Alipay (or using WeChat, bank transfer, or even cash). Once your payment has been verified by the exchange, the seller’s bitcoins will be transferred to you. As you can see, in this way you can trade bitcoins in China without going through complicated account opening and international money transfer as with bitcoin exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitfinex.*

Please be mindful of your language; I believe this is a family-oriented forum.
Yes, it is possible that my smart betting will become unstuck; for example, the price might not go higher than what I paid for today.  But right now I am doing quite well.   I have also done well enough that even if the price goes down to zero today, I would still be way ahead; that's what I mean by "can't lose".

They actually haven't really donated anything yet. Apparently they have merely pledged to do so. Let's wait until real money or BTC is actually handed over. Until then, this is just PR.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:59:54
I don't think me means that it's a policy; rather that it's a purely subjective urge that some might sometimes find irresistible given their investments.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:09:02
That's an interesting idea, although I am unclear as to what merely  "participating in the economy", and I would have to know before I take the trouble.   Still, a bigger concern when it comes to BTC purchases is the lack of recourse in the event of fraud, questionable products, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:51:50
Just one problem: the value people attach to bitcoin (etc.) is how much real money (e.g. USD) they can get for it; that's why the BTC/USD(real money) have people worked up all the time.   So, the mere fact that the supply is caped is irrelevant; what matters is whether there will be enough suckers who believe in it that they will put in real money that others can take out (and say how they got rich off bitcoin).
Store value!  Ask people who decided to store some value at the ATH last year how they feel right now about their stored value.  Cash-under-the-mattress would have been better!
The transaction speed is largely irrelevant because bitcoins are being used as gambling-pyramid-scam tokens, and not as currency that normal people regularly use for goods and services.    
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:21:36
Bitcoin is going nowhere, friend.    Wake up to reality.   
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:07:18
True.   But not everyone can make it sound as impressive and deep as the "technical analysis" do.   
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:56:02
Nice.  I am, however, not planning on parting with any of my BTCs, as I plan to sell them for a bundle.   Can I use a regular credit card?   That would also help if you did not deliver, as I have fraud protection on that but not with BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:28:07
No, I did not state that they use it a store of value; what I said is that they hope to lure more suckers in and profit from it.  Not everything that is used in a scam is a store of value, even if the scam turns out to be profitable.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:18:44
Bitcoin depends on blockchain, however blockchains can be used without involving bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.   It is the latter than reputable entities are looking at.    So, whenever you see "blockchain" don't immediately get excited about bitcoin and cryptocurrecnies.

What about them?    First, most people in their daily lives are not involved in sending money abroad.   Second, if they are at all concerned with current systems, there is no indication that the concern is enough to make them switch to these funny systems.






That is very funny!  Actually bitcoins and suchlike are produced out of nothing and distribributed.   Also, if you look at my statement, I said that most people---not all--have some no use for bitcoin and suchlike.   Those are the normal people.  I'm sure that there is a small group of zealots who like the funny money.




Try and read more carefully.  What I stated is that most people in places like Zimbabwe do not have the means (mostly financial) to get into bitcoins and suchlike.   That is a very different statement from saying, which I did not that there are no means for getting them in Zimbawe.  Likewise, I never stated that there is no want.   What I stated is that it will not solve the fundamental problems.
You can tout bitcoin all you want on such basis, but the reality is quite different: how many people in Zimbabwe are using bitcoin as a a workaround to their hyperinflation issues?   They actually use the US$ for that. not some funny money! 
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:28:38
Unless prices also go up in the right proportions and one keeps selling at the right times, it is possible to keep purchasing while it's going down and end up with a large number of coins at a very low average but still be out of pocket.    For example, say a person 1 BTC and 17K and another at 13K on the way done.   That's an average of 15K.  His average is down, but the fact remains that *he still spent 30K*, and the only way he can later break even or get ahead is to sell both 30K or higher.   That is, regardless of whether he buys when it's going down or when it's going down, he needs to sell at higher than what he actually spent.
Remember that bitcoin is barely used for goods and services (and when it is, the calculation of cost is relative to real money) and its real use is hodl in the hope of profiting from new entrants.     
That is what matters is not just the average that one spent on buying a given number of bitcoins, it is what those bitcoins are worth in real money.  Just saying I have X bitcoins, and they cost Y is meaningless.

You aren't going the homework, are you?  OK, I give up.  Let's put it all into bitcoin and suchlike funny stuff, right?  Sound good.  Plus we get, for free, decentralization, anonymity, victory over big government and banks, freedom for the people, etc. etc. etc.   I'm all for it.   But right now we need more dumb, greedy suckers piling into bitcoin, so that we can maintain our stored value.   So, instead  of arguing, how about we join forces and help with the pumping and then take our ~~cash~~ slice and run?  Let the late-arrival dimwits worry about their store of value.  OK, friend?
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:27:19

I wasn't talking about technology; I was talking about bitcoin etc.   Just because technology in general "changes the society faster than most can imagine" does not mean that every type of technology will have that effect.

I want people here to pay careful attention and learn something useful.   
Blockchain has other applications beyond funny money.    Endorsing blockchain says nothing about bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.    So, no need to get so excited over all this.
You're welcome!

Not quite.   The regulators may have been late to the game, but it should be very obvious by now that things are going to start changing.    The scams and criminality are simply getting out of hand.    So I would bet that quickly on "if the 10x spikes in 2013 and 2017 can be engineered, there is nothing to say that it can't be engineered again".

Yes, it is, if you are awake at all times.   Try this, or at least keep it for a note and later check
Right now the price is $10.4K.  If you but now and hold, at some point in the next 10 days it will go down to near $9.4.   You can sell then.
You don;'t have to do it, but just keep a note of it and send me p.m. if I was right.

Friend, I too am interested in the new form of technology.   In fact, I make a tidy bundle from daily trading of BTC.   But does that mean I have to join the fantasy of a Heaven-on-Earth run on BTC?  I don't see why.

I'm fond of my head and would prefer to keep it, thank you.   Why hold BTC?  I have found that I can make money by selling at higher than my purchase price.   It's a very profitable little game.   For spending, I have the usual cards.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:49:55
The JP Morgan supposedly says that he regrets saying whatever about bitcoin.  That's good PR.   Says nothing about JP Morgan joining the bitcoin movement.  What the guy says that is positive is that about the technology behind it (i,e, blockchain), but that is quite different from saying anything positive about bitcoin.
Goldman Sachs *does not* own Circle.  Please do your homework.  Also read this from just yesterday:  
It's very telling the way people are desperately trying on some of these stories.    It's actually funny when one considers that bitcoin is supposedly to help people away from the Wall Street types.   Far better to just accept the reality, however painful; that's what I think. 
P.S. Read more than just the headlines of what you see, and also seek verification from other sources.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:18:10
It depends on what one is up to, for what, and how frequently.   I think that the reality is that if you consider what most people do with money, the speed of transfers is not any kind of problem.   I don;t know, but I doubt that even most bitcoiners are in it because they have all these transfers that must be done in haste.
As for freezing accounts, I have had that happen to me a few times, and I'm glad it did happen.   The bank noticed some funny transactions on my cards and stopped things until they could check with me.   Hard to see that happening with all these cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:36:16

Let Google be your friend and look at what's happening with blockchains outside money.    
By the way, establishing whether or not a "decentralised, trustless, and censorship resistant" blockchain without a "token of value"/scam-coin" is possible is simply a matter of technical understanding.   Give it some thought, and you will get there.

You can have all of "decentralised, trustless, and censorship resistant" without involving a "token of value"/scam-coin/etc. There is nothing of the latter funny money that is inherent in what constitutes a blockchain.      And because you can have all that without the funny money, there is your answer as to why you might need a blockchain but have no use for funny money.

The number of players certainly means it won't go near zero any time soon; there will still be many people looking at past performance and saying "if I just hodl, I will get rich at some point".   However, the days of riches are long gone, as there won't be any more masses of greedy but clueless types rushing in to be fleeced.    
So, it won't "finish" soon, but don't expect too many changes either.

The "technical analysis" geeks? They are full of it, but one has to admit it's very impressive-sounding b.s.  They will probably tell you that it's because  Fibonnaci's legs and feet  got hit by an Elliot wave while swimming, and such a wave is a resistance there is no support.   Therefore look for a brreakout from under the wave, which will help Fibonnaci use his head and shoulders and then return to the market, with three choices: buy, sell, or do nothing.

Yep.  The only way for bitcoin etc. to get similar usage to regular cards is for bitcoin etc. to become more like regular cards.   That won't happen, although the bitcoin zealots refuse to see it and continue to indulge in dubious dreams.
