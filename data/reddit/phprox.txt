I have never heard of this, is it similar to bitcoins vs. namecoins?

Obviously, you could always download the whole chain if your wanted to. You know, to stick it to the man and contribute to decentralization.
It's just, if you make a new wallet and need to use if very quickly, should you *have* to download the whole blockchain first?

We are using 'Version 0' of the bitcoin address system, and when that is converted to base 58, the leading digit is always a 1. Other types of addresses do exist.

Thanks for your comment!
If not Mt. Gox, then any of the other large Bitcoin websites, such as blockchain.info. We already trust their certificate that we use for SSL in HTTPS to browse. So just like the PKI is used to ensure a secure connection to the webserver, they could ensure a reliable, accurate snapshot of the blackchain.
But wait? Do you actually need the blockchain for transactions? If attempt so send more coins than you have, the network will reject the transaction. So you just need the protocol and the keys to an address to interact with the currency, but you only need the full blockchain to verify how much money another address has.

You could try [Dragons Tale]( You walk around like an MMO and play in-game gambling games of all sorts and amounts. You also often find change laying around the world.

Best thing I read in a Warren Buffett biography was "Put all your eggs in one basket, and watch that basket closely."
Diversifying lowers risk, which by definition lowers return.

Bitcoins aren't stored anywhere. They are stored everywhere, in the blockchain.
