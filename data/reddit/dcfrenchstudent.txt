The map shows 2 buttons - 17 and 22 - I would like to know who those 17/22/17+22 merchants in India are.

I know the backstory to that name - in the movie, he says Kobayashi was set on the case  by Mr. Keyser Söze. Kobayashi is just the "enforcer" on the ground while Mr. Söze is the top dog.

can you PM me the name of town? I will tell you if it is really remote or not.
Moreover, how is the lender going to enforce and get back his loans from a bumblehead who lives in a "remote town" in India?
definitely a scam!

This still doesn't imply/say/mean/any synonym of your choice the world/US economy is going to collapse. All it says is, it is a Jewish tradition of settling debts, except those owed to foreigners, and got coopted into some religious text.

I googled it. All I get are those crackpot, end-of-the-world-apocalypse, infowars/natural "news" type over-the-top nonsensical crank blogs. Wikipedia just says it is the agricultural cycle.
