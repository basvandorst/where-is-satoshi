When the market hits 20k, you doubled your profit! Not bad, you are ahead of the curve!

No way it's gonna drop that low. You're dumb. Whales may have a lot of power in this market, but people will buy it when it drops and it will always balance out. There are also those like me who will never sell and always hold.

I don't know who you are or how you know this, but i'm gullible, so I went all in. If you're wrong, I will hunt you down. Jk of course

I'm sorry to hear about what you went through. I'm glad at least something positive came from it. I wish you the best.

People can donate whatever they want. Just like people can date whoever they want or eat whatever they want or talk about whatever they want. If you want someone to donate to you first off what you have to realize is nobody likes to give away their money for any reason unless you are providing some sort of value into their lives. It's the law of reciprocity. If you are someone who helps other people for no profit whatsoever, that person will most likely feel entitled to return the favor. I don't know you or what you have done to better my life, but i'm not giving you my money.

It's a herd mentality. We all want to feel like we belong somewhere. Why do you think gangs exist? We all want to be part of the club. Nobody wants to be excluded.

I don't know. Hard to say. It's probably not going to last very long. I wouldn't worry to much about if you're holding long-term.

yeah man, I regret not buying the winning lottery ticket. If only I had hodl- oh wait
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:29:41
Do you know how to work that mouth of yours? If so, you might just be in luck!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:37
Let's just hope it was just mere coincidence..

I don't know how to play poker. All casino games are essentially odds against you sort of deal. Bitcoin is where I gamble my money, because odds are in your favor.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:58:54
I sent you some dick pics. Have fun!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:08
Look on the bright side..

lol the reverse psychology mentality of this sub is baffling

Could be worse. Some guy bought 2 pizzas for 10k bitcoins. Hope that makes you feel a little better.

The thing is if I truly cared about up votes or something to please the mass i'd post a funny meme and it's be more effective. Truthfully, i'm just being authentic and myself. I don't use graphs, or charts or logistics. I'm using intuition. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:55:56
That's true and some people are successful doing it. Is it because bitcoin is their full job and they know something most people don't or purely dumb luck? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:13:05
I can't complain. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:32:04
LoL, if it hits 100k then I might sell.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:20:07
I approve.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:49:17
Listen to your intuition. There are so many brainiacs on this forum that think they know it all including myself. I bought some not too long ago. I guess I believe there's still hope. People will panic. Nothing new. That's about all I can say. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:25:06
I bought all mine when it was $3500-$4500, so I haven't lost any profit. Even if it does drop that low which I doubt then i'll buy some more. If the price goes back up I make more money. It's a win-win situation. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:59:30
haha, one day you'll understand!
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:49:47
Somewhere out there..far beyond...an echo...and it says..no
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:17:03
I'm in. Good luck ya'll.

pure speculation, nobody can tell for sure. If you're wrong, then you will suffer the consequences for not HODLing.
