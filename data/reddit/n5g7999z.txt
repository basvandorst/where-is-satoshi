I'm a bit fascinated by this.  Would you mind doing a mini-AMA?
Do you day trade BTC (sell out at the end of each day) or do you actively trade but keep large BTC reserves? 
How often do you make trades?  
Do you deal in USD vs. BTC, or do you play in other fiat currencies/altcurencies as well?  
Do you ever short BTC?  
What have your returns been like?
Do you actively trade other things (stocks, commodities) as well?
Do you have strong moral feelings ("I want to help Bitcoin decentralize the world money supply!") about BTC, and if so, do you think that effects how you trade?
Is trading BTC your full time job?

Is "to the moon" the only acceptable response?

Thanks!  I was just curious to see someone obsessively following Bitcoin movements like a professional stock broker, but doing it between video games.  Glad to hear you don't have all your eggs in the Bitcoin basket!
If you want a great book on markets (and how it's hard to "beat the market"), I'd highly recommend Burton Malkiel's "A Random Walk Down Wall Street".

If I had a nickel for every time a girl told me that...

How is this usually done?  Do you mark each of your pizzas with a bitcoin price, or in USD that you convert at market rates upon checkout?
