I've often thought that concerns about deflation apply more to organisations / businesses than individual consumers. Most consumers buy things to satisfy direct needs which they can't do without (e.g. food,shelter,etc) or don't want to do without (luxury items, entertainment, computers, etc). 
Businesses however are generally more likely to spend money on the basis of expected returns. If a piece of capital investment doesn't look like it will ever pay for itself then the sensibly run business will generally avoid such a purchase if they can. This makes them much more likely to be affected by deflation than private individuals (excluding the very wealthy whose spending is much more discretionary).
Even for businesses though, a small amount of deflation is unlikely to bother them. Technology is notorious for its constant devaluation yet businesses continue to invest in IT because it (presumably) overall produces enough of a productivity increase to be worthwhile. 
But while a deflation of (say) 2% a year is not really an issue for most businesses it would be different if deflation hit 40%+ or more. Retailers with a low profit margin and a high stock lifespan might find it simply uneconomic to continue trading. Manufacturers might find their products worth less than the raw materials by the time they came to sell them. Any sort of property investment would be folly if you knew any investment would be worth a lot less in a years time. It's these type of investments that would be disrupted in a deflationary spiral, not basic consumer behaviour. Consumers don't have the option to "cease trading" (short of suicide) while if a business cannot generate positive returns for its owners then it can (and often does) stop operations.
Note : I am not suggesting deflation would ever be a problem under bitcoin - I have no idea on that one.
