Honestly, I "predicted" this last night as I was explaining how bitcoins work to a friend of mine. I told him as soon as we hit 250, the value will drop because there will be a huge wall of sellers at that point. Fortunately things have stabilized and all that happened (hopefully) is that people learned a lesson about playing with speculative values. If they wish to see the value rise more and more, they will need to coordinate. I'm not sure if that is possible in such large scale.
I think it will drop again and then slowly and steadily rise as it becomes more useful. The value seen after the next drop stabilizes, will be it's true value at that point in time.
That is what I honestly believe.

Oh, the story was not up yet when I wrote this.

Although I agree with most of what Max Keiser says about Bitcoin, he's not exactly impartial to this issue. You can deduce most of the points he has to bring by yourself by staying informed.

Now I wonder how much the removal is going to cost you.

Tell that to my harem.

This could just as well be a scare tactic in order to push people to sell before it drops and so they can buy more, thinking they've got hold of some "inside" info. Effectively causing the drop in value they're looking for.
It could be many things. I would not pay attention to it.

Oh my god, I have a ponytail and work in IT! So that means I'm safe?
Edit: Does it matter if I look sexy with a ponytail or do I have to be fat, greasy and unattractive?

I can't say I know a lot about virtual currency trends. I traded 72 PPCoin on BTC-E for 0.33btc one night where people were pumping and dumping PPC and TRC. They could set the price they wanted as Vircurex was down and no other exchange site supported PPC and TRC.
I learned what I know from trading by trading for 24 hours and following bitcoin since the beginning. My speciality is more in the area of human behaviour.
What happened is that the people who made the value of the bitcoin rise were people looking for a quick investment. They had no interest in a decentralized currency. They were always only looking to dump when they felt their original investment had paid off. Also, as you said, panic selling was sure to happen when it hit a certain point. The people who truly believe in bitcoin were never going to sell. They had no intention of using bitcoin as an investment to gain USD or whatever other currency. 
The ultimate point of bitcoin, is to use the coin itself as a currency, not as an exchange currency.
It seems bitcoin dropped considerably again today, 63USD and it's dropping fast. I'm pretty sure It will stabilize soon and will stay there for a long time. I would guess around 25-30USD I think it would be safe to buy around that price but do not expect a huge spike in value anytime soon. Slow and steady wins the race.
Today I had to call Bell in order to make changes to my account. I received very good service and offered the agent a small bitcoin tip. He said he was actually thinking about bringing his wallet info to work in case this happened. Too bad he wasn't prepared.
I think now that the bitcoin bubbles are bursting, we may finally see innovation.
It really is not encouraging for a new e-commerce to start accepting bitcoin when it is worth 250$ each.
I hope people will not be scared off, because bitcoin is not weakening, it is stronger than ever.
