true indeed!
At the very least, this is a nice step closer to that result we all expect
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:26:07
either many people decided to buy at one time, or Whale(s). They are like a Whale in the ocean. If one is close, the water level rises...

I am also interested in knowing this.
@_date: 2019-07-07 12:54:39
I do, but only for trading... However I am moving away from it as they have "hidden" fees.
I recommend Coinbase pro and I am sure some others can recommend others that may also be really good. I am only familiar with the two.

 Yep me too! Sleep is for the weak lol

By doing that while the price is increasing you are essentially giving up value. Each time you sell the profits, its like you are taking the initial investment and buying at the new price... Keeping profit means keeping value.
However, if you are only into day trading and earning as much as possible now, then it makes sense. However, as the price increases or even drops, you are doing the opposite of accumulating coin.
So short term profits == yes, this makes sense
Long term value/profit == worst thing you can do

Yeah it jumped up for a second, then declined slightly. I suspect it will find its legs though
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:53:14
This is my fear as well. I'm gonna take the plunge though, because if they do pull something we'll have nothing...
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:48:43
Yep, nice little jump there to break past 11.5k
@_date: 2019-07-05 23:33:14
Agreed, I like it. To me it points to healthy growth.
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:25:43
Cool thanks!
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:46:47
Don't hold your breath...
My recommendation: accumulate
See the opportunity... seize the opportunity
It will rise in time

Can you withdraw bitcoin from gemini to cold storage?
In other words, is Gemini like Robinhood as in investing only?
Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:09:24
Yeah I know but that is the application in marketing. When they leave it lowers, etc..
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:18:48
Hit the "Price Talk" link above, or "general"
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:12:18
Let me check the future, hold on... I'll get back to you on Monday. :p
Just j/k
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:45:59
That sounds like a good plan though :)
Here's hoping it works out
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:28:32
that's a fair statement.
Maybe I should say "mildly sturdy"? :)
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:02:57
Oh no lol of course not... balls sweat isnt cool haha, but just wear boxers that day... get a little wind tunnel going and I think you'll make it just fine.

For mining, how does one use the Crytocompare mining calculator?
How do you determine how much you can mine/earn?
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:35:32
11.1/11.2k seems to be solid support
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:03:08
Robinhood. If there is a cheaper way, then I am just not aware of it. The lowest I am aware of at the moment is Robinhood, but then again I am no expert or know-it-all, so ...
Caveat, you cannot transfer to and from wallets though ... at least not yet
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:48:07
Very happy with the 10k defend today. I am so on board the bitcoin bandwagon!
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:14:31
Oh yes, I have high hopes and anticipate a massive ATH as well, hopefully surpassing the previous sooner than later :)
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:55:50
Same here and I am in the exact same boat. I really prefer owning coin and placing it in cold storage as well. Good luck to you and I'm hopeful it wont set you back any. 
I'm working on getting a cold storage device atm, and once I do I think I will sell on RH and get some real bitcoin. I just have to time things right and maybe I can turn this negative into a positive
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:17:34
Thanks, I will try this.
@_date: 2019-07-05 13:59:25
This is spot on. You must invest only what you are okay losing. If you are not okay losing it, then it is logical to say that there is a 50/50 you will strike gold or lose it all. 
This is a risky investment hands down and nothing anyone can say will bring you piece if you are scared of losing what you have invested.
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:43:53
Exactly, and I agree. However, if the OP wants to trade only, outside of any other better options, Robinhood definitely serves that purpose.
As the OP states, he just wants to buy and sell for low fees. (Selling is the key that I took from that), so it seems like the goal is to cash out (fiat)
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:34:30
Robinhood has plans to allow transferring coin and to wallets, but that is a promise and not a guarantee. I also trade using Robinhood so this is how I know. Like you, I am working on changing that.
I would recommend signing up to Bitrex or coinbase (or other reputable trade sites) in order to take your cash (after pulling from robinhood if desired) and actually buy bitcoin and move it to secure cold storage, etc..
This is my plan and I hope it works out for you. It will either be that or wait for Robinhood to implement coin trading on their platform. I never trust in promises, but it is nice that it is supposedly in their plans.
@_date: 2019-10-09 20:36:57
If a serious question, then it all depends on where you currently have it stored. 
If where you have it stored supports transfer to Fiat, then yes, but it will be your bank account instead of via using a debit card.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:34:34
Not yet... but after a while we can all but guarantee that much. "not financial advice" yada yada
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:12:54
This \^I take this approach as well so that I just don't have any expectations. It is all about taking a high probability chance. Just imagine if gamblers had patience... how much more money they may have today vs losing it all in a day on much lower probabilities of success
