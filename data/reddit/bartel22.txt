Expectations for adoption speed are just unrealistically high
We are a good 5 to 10 years away from large scale, ubiquitous adoption

I guess what happens if someone is able to hack all the accounts...?  
I think it would sort of suck for someone to completely take over the Bitcoin network and have all the money with no way of reversing it...
At least banks now can reverse transactions so that can protect your money..

They have not provided a copy of their insurance contract and if their is a flash crash
on their own servers which they are in control and could even spread to other exchanges what
price will they payout, i would suggest the highest of all the 30-60-90 averages including 
subset averages begging certain time frames before any events started unfolding,
if the price was to run down one week or one month before they declared an insurance cover
then the average price should be calculated before the price rundown, these tactics where
used very successfully up to 2-3 months before its was completely obvious mtgox was about
to go bankrupt.

I think it's funny. I had never seen or heard of this video until this morning, then when I come to the forums to browse around I just so happen to see a thread about it.
Fate? Nah, physics.
