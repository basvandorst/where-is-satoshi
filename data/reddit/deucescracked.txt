Oh give me a break. If I write a book and call it "The Me Book" and then later I add a new prologue or epilogue or update the text because a sequel made it necessary or preferable and some cocksmoker goes ahead and makes "The Me Book Cash" which is closer to the original text of The Me Book, TMBC is not 'the real' THMB.

You know, I was going to say I couldn't think of a single thing the government didn't totally corrupt to its purposes and for profit and to fuck the common person but then I thought, well, the internet. I mean, they do get huge data and surveillance from it but it's egalitarian ... until net neutrality anyway ... and technically it really is uncensored even if some of the less censored parts are incredibly unseemly.

"And" that is misleading to people seeking bitcoin or information on bitcoin. "And" it is fraud plain and simple. "And" it demonstrates that all bitcoin cash has, and every measure of what minor success it has achieved is due entirely to, the word bitcoin in its name. It shares no more with Bitcoin than any other empty, hackable coin. Calling it the real bitcoin is like calling a Ford f250 "the real ferrari."

If it's not against the laws of that nation but is against the rules / stipulations of a contract set up by a regulatory agency then it's illegal as fraud and breach of contract.

Assets aren't backed by other assets. Yes, Bitcoin has inherent value.


The Buffalo's portfolio includes many and diverse companies, including those he himself once called overvalued, such as United Airlines. You are ignorant. "lol".


Sorry, unless you actually are calling it a currency I don't see a reason to entertain your hypotheticals.


Thus proving you don't know what currency is


Or they accept BTC because they want to hold it. Like, gee, I don't know, countless vendors throughout the world and almost all of Japan? Lord you're clueless.


Who gives a shit what any FOREX trader would think about BTC? It's not FOREX. But you know what kind of trader would think, 'oh look it's cheaper let's buy it'? People who believe in it.

As an American who's been living abroad I've been watching the bitcoin price and the price discussions and I always find it interesting to consider the different parts of the world. 
Today's a good example. I wake up to 'bitcoin price is down,' and see that it's currently rising... just as my Asian neighbors are all scratching their balls and gazing bleerily at their glowing rectangles and making their shitty espresso drinks.
I get the feeling (and it's just a feeling at this point, no serious SPSS inputs yet) that the lulls in price are followed by people waking up, blinking and saying "Holy crap a discount!" and clicking.

More important to look at the smaller moves to gain a better understanding of what's happening intraday. The greater trend is the price is moving downward, obviously, that's what IS happening. You don't need technical indicators to tell you that.

You're 100% wrong about that. Banks do have their own currencies, and have for decades. In fact some use blockchain for that now. In the past they used a system my uncle helped program. The fact is they just don't want to release the authority over the coin. That's not mysterious or controversial in the slightest, sorry. And frankly to say they never thought about it is ridiculous. You realize money was originally called "bank notes" for a reason, right?
Anyway, 'they didn't because they didn't think about it' is hardly an argument for them *not doing it after it's been shown to be possible.* I mean come on. Some bank had to be the first to offer a mortgage, right? Then they all copied it? Your statement doesn't make any sense.


I did. And now let me double down.


LOL right yeah and speed limits prevent speeding right? World's biggest money launderer: HSBC. World's biggest ponzi schemes *all* run by banks and securities corporations. Biggest financial scam in history went down in 2008/9 and nobody went to jail... lord have mercy you must be insane. Proper regulations preventing this or that oh brother.


No, they can't be stopped because criminal behavior can't be stopped. It's part of humanity. Anything that has value and can be transferred will be subject to fraud.

Not only the above but, straight up, there is no incentive for anyone to share their profit and infrastructure with you if they have a profitable enterprise. People: just use your brains. If you had a profitable mining operation which would you rather do: give away part of your "guaranteed" profit for temporary gain or reinvest your profit to grow exponentially? It's not mysterious. If you're buying in you're paying for risk.
The risk it doesn't make enough money, the rigs fail, the hidden risk that it's just a scam and of course the fact that you're paying someone else to make money they may not want to return to you.
It's like people who buy from ticket "discount" sites. They're paying more than the site pays and most of the time all you have to do is research the flight through sky scanner or hipmunk then buy the flight on your own cheaper than they have it. You think they're operating at a loss? Jesus. Just think critically, please.

He's absolutely not dumb, but I doubt he has any worthwhile cryptocurrency advisers. Not to mention that since he has this reputation (which he probably himself believes) as being the smartest and best investor ever who would advise him? I'd say he more likely has data and information gatherers that he makes decisions based off the reports of. Those info gatherers? Newspapers. Maybe assistants. 
I have great respect for WB but there are things you're failing to recognize. First of all, he's old school to a fault. This is a new world. When it comes to long term stock investing I'll reread The Intelligent Investor every two years and never fail to buy a new edition (though there hasn't been one in a decade) and I'll even consult my WB check list for swing trades. I follow his ten rules. 
But old generals want horseback cavalry and old admirals want wooden ships. Just look at the opening for the article. 


This is a man who famously stated you shouldn't invest in anything you don't understand. That counts for betting against something as well. I mean that's literally his FIRST rule of investing. This is a man who, I very much love him for this, mandates reading time for his employees every work day. Beautiful. But he hasn't learned anything about this thing he's poo-pooing. 
The other thing to remember about Warren is that *he is a public figure.* He represents, to the world, the traditional banking and investing system. He is not his own man anymore. Straight up - he could not endorse cryptocurrencies if he wanted to and OF COURSE he is going to be against the thing that is aiming to completely upend his world. It only makes sense. He, like all old men, want peace and calm and tranquility and stability. I'd be lying if I said it didn't appeal to me as well. But you can't stem the tide by wishing it weren't raining and the waters they are a-rising.

My thoughts are twofold:
1. Japan embraces Bitcoin. Japan is careful about almost everything. Surely they see its disruptive potential. This proves that a government with its people's well being at heart will accept Bitcoin and endorse it. Further, it gives Bitcoin a solid, strong basis in value - anything you want to buy from Japan, buy it with Bitcoin! Who cares if your gov't tries to stop it? Who gives a greasy titfuck?
2. We need Bitcoin to be all-out attacked by a national government. If it fails, it doesn't deserve the crown. I bet it would adapt. And in so doing prove itself.

No, it's not. If it were you'd ask it of Google.com or YouTube.com. When someone on an internet forum questions your position instead of stating their own it is almost always to attempt to peg you to a position in order to then attempt to discredit it because they are themselves afraid to take a position and have it attacked.
If you wanted to know what product or service Bitcoin provides you'd only have to employ basic logic - because it's obvious - or, if your logical abilities were insufficient for some reason - go to Google, read the sidebar of this sub, look up any beginner's level Bitcoin explainer video, etc., etc., etc.

Anyway, not sure what explanation you're seeking but seeing fees drop dramatically and payments processed instantly and you pointing it out hardly qualifies as fud, so, yeah, you're right it's not. 
Just, seriously, buddy, be aware that if BCH ever got popular the transaction fees and times would skyrocket. The "empty truck is faster" argument is kind of dumb. I mean, do you really think that the average joe miner is going to be able to mine 8mb, 16mb, 1gb blocks...? You really think that if BCH got popular and only a few big mining ops were able to do the mining that they wouldn't jack up the price considering that's the entire reason BCH exists? The very first rule of economics is that people behave according to their incentives. Look at the leadership of BCH and ask yourself what their incentives are then get on back to me after a while.

What you're talking about is referred to as 'paper trading' in the speculation / trading business. This is because back in the good old days before everything beeped a trader would write down the price of an asset and how much they'd put into it and do the same for sales, purchase, etc - just keeping track in a ledger. Date, price, amount, bought or sold. Right down the new value every day, week or month and of course the 'bottom line' of the ledger which is the loss/profit of the whole portfolio. 
Naturally now almost every software trading suite has the 'simulated' or 'paper trading' option but you can do it just in excel with googling or the newspaper for your price data. Doing it the old fashion way is, IMHO, better for your mindfulness and recall. Back in the day I used to be able to recite the morning and afternoon prices for what I was watching for the last week upon request. Good to be able to watch patterns.

Low fee, cross currency, instant. Good luck beating that.


Proving you have no idea how LN works


Ummmmm it *is* on the main net. What are you even talking about?


What you mean is that you are invest in BCH and want to convince others it's the future because you think that since it's cheap compared to BTC it has a lot of room to grow and might get you rich like early BTC adopters. The reality is that BTC is advancing and BCH is stagnating. Saying BCH is 'the original vision of bitcoin' is like saying a hand cranked meat grinder is better because it's 'the original vision of hamburgers'. Or would you prefer to drive a model T with bigger wheels instead of a Tesla?


But that's not what is happening.

might be a complete pickle nibbler but he has a point. Dollar cost averaging is a viable strategy to get the 'right price' for something or mitigate your risk as the price fluctuates, but it only really makes sense if you're planning on a bigger purchase than your risk profile should necessarily allow (or on the higher side of it) or if you have a price in mind that you absolutely believe in and cannot afford to buy it all at that one time. It's really just a method of allowing you to buy what you can when you can, more when the price is lower and less when it is higher.
If you believe in bitcoin and want to own more, buying a little on a fixed schedule is a good way to accomplish that. It's also a good way for many people to prop up the market and create multiple opportunities for them to take profit as well. "Not catching the falling knife" is true - but anyone who thinks bitcoin is a falling knife wouldn't be here and investing in it would they? Just remember, for a better DCA buy more when the price is lower and less when the price is higher.

Market manipulation and ponzi schemes won't he solved, period. Fire extinguishers haven't ended fire and modern detection techniques haven't ended murder. Problems exist. They always will. What decentralization and permission-free money allows is for you to own your own money and use it as you like without being anyone being able to direct or impede you. That's good for everyone who doesn't want to try to own your money, that's pretty clear. In fact everyone can benefit from this, only some people's business and power will suffer from it. The fact they oppose it says quite a lot about their priorities.
Seriously, think about it for even a second: this technology exists and is easy to make and use. Any government, any bank, any business dealing in finance with a programming department could have done this instead of Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone could have made a coin or coins and released it into the wild and given people the ability to transact with each other, to do what they want with their own money like physical cash is used for. But they didn't despite the uncountable good it can do for everyone. Why not? And why now fight it and insult it so hard when it's just plain good and useful?
You know already of course. It upsets their power structure. Same reason people in oppressive regimes aren't allowed rifles. Only in the new world we have this illusion of the potential for our own prosperity and upward mobility so guns aren't the weapon, the tool of control isn't violence it's the dream of money.

So I was at the poker table and I was losing pretty badly. Down a couple thousand bucks. Sucked. But, hey, poker. Painful game. I got up, analyzed my decisions, had a coffee and a beer and a smoke and a murderburger - don't fucking judge me - and came to the conclusion that I played all the prior hands well. Called right, folded right, raised right, got my money in good and still lost. Poker.
Still had my concentration and emotional stability - sat back down. Took six hours but I ended up leaving the casino with a nice profit of around 50% my original buy in. Long session. Hard to survive it, hour after hour of beat after beat.
Couple years later I'm at another table and I'm winning big (for that game) and had quadrupled my buy in and looked around and realized I was done getting paid at this table. People were tightening up, I'd had a hell of a lucky run whether or not I played it well and it was time to go. I start to stand up and this adorable old lady with that puffy white hair says, "You're leaving? But you're winning!" and I replied, "Beats the alternative."
Lesson is simple: If you want to lose, leave when you're down.

In case anyone missed it, he said he'd sell puts but not short it. The difference is pretty big - a put has a premium that changes based on the price of the underlying asset (and other factors, such as time remaining on the contract).
I believe in bitcoin and I'd buy a put as well. I'd do it to hedge, as I own bitcoin, but that's not the point - the point is that when the price of bitcoin goes down the premium on a put goes up therefore you can sell that put for a profit even if you think the price of bitcoin will go back up later.

Depends on the odds of each. If you were to flip a coin for all your money that'd be a bad deal. But if you were to roll a 1000 sided die where only a roll of 1 would result in a loss and any other number would result in doubling then, yes, it would absolutely be worth it.


I really wonder if you know how blackjack works. What you describe sounds a lot more like roulette. Blackjack actually has great odds (for a casino game).


That's one point of view, but it's not a good one imho. Just because something is cheap doesn't mean it's a good price and something that's not worth the dollar it's priced at shooting to $100 is just as likely to fall back under the original $1 just as fast. Think of like going to a garage sale and seeing a whole bunch of oil paintings for $5 each. Maybe 1 in a million would be a rare lost Picasso and the rest would be the neighbors' kids' work. Same sort of idea. 
In my opinion the point of investing in a new technology - a life and world paradigm shift - is to get in on the ground floor of a new asset class and to support it as it changes the world. Which you and anyone can clearly see it doing. Blockchain projects are big and getting bigger. All over every news source in every country. Just compare it to the internet boom. Sure, lots of projects are ABSOLUTELY going to fail. I see BCH going the way of Myspace, for example. But blockchains aren't going anywhere but up and they absolutely will be the future of finance.
People think banks are huge and powerful and *they're not wrong* but they are that way out of necessity. When that necessity is removed - and they're fighting so hard and talking such trash because they see that happening right now - they won't be worth the suffering they cause or the cost they inflict to support them. They made a business by denying people their own money, it's really quite insane when it comes down to it.


In some ways, sure. A 'penny stock' is a stock with a very low price and market cap thus capable of drastic price movements. Some cryptos still have a very low price. It would seem all are still capable of drastic price movements compared to most traditional investment classes. But not all have a very small market cap. The ways that cryptocurrencies are different from penny stocks are much more important. A penny stock share is a token of partial ownership of a company and the price will change based on the market movements of those shares and that's mainly based on market sentiment and, of course, quite often manipulation. What happens at these companies can either be totally behind closed doors, scammy, opaque to the extreme or transparent and easily audited. If you want to know the truth about a company like that you have to do your own research and it may well be floundered.
I, for example, began investing in marijuana company stocks a couple years ago after some success with high growth pharma stocks. My first question to myself was always, "Will this company be able to grow beyond penny stock range later," and it worked for pharma. Basically I weighed the genuine potential. Easier with pharma than pot but hey. As you may well know marijuana companies and stocks are wild west style. Lots of bullshit, lots of fraudulent companies making themselves seem legit, doing reverse takeovers and all that just to sell stock. They don't have a future, they don't have a real business plan or a great management team and etc. But there are some jewels and those are worth looking for - it's going to be a HUGE industry. I mean, it IS a huge industry but it's only going to get bigger. I rarely make declarative statements but I'm confident enough to say for a fact it'll happen.
So I start sifting. One company I come across has great buzz. I know the stock is going to go up. I buy it, it triples in value in like a few days with most of the growth on the third, I dump it on the way up because I can just tell the peak is right there. And I'm right. Why did I dump this monster? Because even though I could tell it would rise because of the public sentiment, I didn't know if the company had any validity when I bought. Stupid move you may say, but if you watch things like a hawk it's not so bad. So I bought in, then did my research. Shoot first ask questions later, eh? Not my usual method but c'est la vie. My research discovered a few things, the most important being that literally nothing they claimed could be verified. Google maps street view of their location showed a warehouse with a different name on the sign, for example. All sorts of red flags. Not people claiming it was a scam, not any egregious business practices *just nothing was verifiable.* So I knew I had to be a shark and just leave them holding their own bags. That's a dangerous game.
Crypto is easier. Things are supposed to be open. The code, the tech, it's all right there to audit. The mission and plan and idea behind it as well. And the most important thing: community support. A distributed ledger is as good as its network, the network are the node operators and the node operators are people. It is, essentially, an idea. Just an idea. You want to know if a crypto will succeed? Here's how to have a better than a coinflip success rate on that guess: 
1 - is it novel. Does do anything another crypto or technology cannot do yet, and does it have a good enough development team to stay ahead of the competition that will come to do that new thing? No? Don't even think about getting into it. 
2 - does it have a really, really good idea? BlockV, another project I am watching, has a really great idea. They want their tokens to be ownable items like coupons and concert tickets. Really cool stuff, great idea, and it would take a whole new layer for Bitcoin to mimic that. I'm still trying to figure out a way to hack it. If I can't then I'll have some more faith in it.
3 - do people want to use it? Really simple, what blockchains offer is utility, right? It's as good as the people using it. Easy to see, easy to audit. For example look at any alt coin's transactions per hour or day and correlate that to the price of other coins and then to the movements of each other. If it seems that people can just take or leave one or the other then, really, people don't care about the coin. It's not a growth medium. 
4 - do they have a marketing team? If so, they're probably shit. Something this, so new and with so much buzz, if it can't stand on its own merits and shine on its own achievements then it's crap.

Actually the schemes would have free reign and the schemers would have free rein but nvm. Banks do not secure your money. They are a vast and vulnerable single point of failure. Time and time again they're hacked or there's embezzlement or they change their policies to cost you money without notification or your approval or simply deny access. This is not security. Cryptocurrency is secure *by default* and is as easy to keep secure as the effort it takes to not share your bank card and PIN with someone. The attacks it takes to make your crypto less secure are reliant on attacking the wallet's owner, as long as that person is informed the crypto is secure.
Banks provide excellent security for PHYSICAL currency but more than 80% of fiat currency is digital. What's the point? Why pay someone for something you can do yourself for less effort and have more control and access and not have to ask permission? That has great value.
I think but I am not sure that I agree with you that cryptocurrency wasn't designed as an investment vehicle. Surely SN would know that people who exchange their hard earned government notes for Bitcoin would not want the value of BTC to fall when they do it. Surely he would also know the price would not be stable, at least not for its early life. I think we can probably all agree that SN would be smart enough to understand that releasing a speculative token into the wild would result in its price fluctuating and it's being used for many different things.
Now, before you go thinking investing in Bitcoin or any token - which is one thing that Bitcoin is - is a poor or idiotic investment I'd say you might want to consider that the value of a token is essentially whatever it can be traded for. As you must know, that's based on consensus. Money is an idea, a story we tell each other and ourselves. This piece of paper or digital signature is worth X. Well, at some point in the last year or so Japan said, "Bitcoin is a valid payment method," and at that point Bitcoins became something you could buy all sorts of stuff in Japan for. And you could do that without having Yen. You could do it from anywhere else in the world that has electricity. You could do it without (if you were so inclined, and which I do not advocate) paying the necessary taxes of your home country or any monetary charges in between required by governments and you could do it anonymously and all that. So then the entirety of the Bitcoin ecosystem at that point jumped quite a lot in value. Whether or not the subsequent price movement justified that value is a point of debate but at least then it could be quantified!
Lets say that ONLY Mitsubishi said they'd accept Bitcoin and there were 21 million Bitcoins already mined or to become available. That would mean that all the stuff Mitsubishi makes would be the total sum value of Bitcoin. Say they make things you could purchase in Japan for a total of 1 billion USD. The value of Bitcoin in Japan would be 1 billion bucks. Now say the same products cost 2 billion USD in the USA due to import regulations, retailer restrictions, high demand or any other reason. And let's say that the sales volume in the USA was the entire inventory (obviously not true, just easy numbers). And let's say that it cost a 3% service fee to spend money from your bank card to send to Japan to purchase direct from Mitsubishi and then the Mitsubishi servicing bank charged a flat service fee and another currency exchange fee an the whole thing ended up being another bloody 15%. That's 300,000,000 bucks premium on Mitsubishi products in the USA.
So if Bitcoin was essentially ONLY Mitsubishi Bucks it'd be worth (with these very small numbers and hypothetical fees) a natural 1,000,000,000 in Japan and 1,300,000,000 in the USA (minus whatever shipping would cost on Mitsu products). Seeing that there would be a price difference obviously there's be arbitrage trading going on and such and the gap would close. So, really, it's not an idiotic investment it's just new. It's backed by whoever accepts and trades in it and what they've already exchanged it for. Please, before you think it's dumb consider the millionaires and billionaires who sell very expensive things for it - they may not be geniuses, but they probably know a bit more about money than you.

What you're referring to is called fundraising and it's the same reason that companies launch an IPO or sell bonds or take loans or solicit angel investors.
In this situation the risk to the "investor" does not justify the potential return. The legitimate way of fundraising here would be to take a loan and pay it back with interest. If someone is sure of their mining farm's ability to produce then that is a better deal for everyone involved. If someone says, "I have the magic faucet of money," and follows that up with anything other than, "and there's no fucking way that I am sharing," they are lying to you. Period. End of story.
There are only two possibilities if a mining farm wants you to pay for their rigs so they get more money up front: Either they are a complete scam and running away with your money or they are not confident in their farm's ability to produce a profit. Think about it from every angle and tell me if you think that doesn't make sense.
Whenever someone comes to me and promises me a great return they're sure will happen I tell them, OK, I'll give you an even better deal. You say your mining farm will return 10%? How about I loan you the money at 5% interest instead? See how quick they backpeddle.

He's absolutely not dumb, but I doubt he has any worthwhile cryptocurrency advisers. Not to mention that since he has this reputation (which he probably himself believes) as being the smartest and best investor ever who would advise him? I'd say he more likely has data and information gatherers that he makes decisions based off the reports of. Those info gatherers? Newspapers. Maybe assistants. 
I have great respect for WB but there are things you're failing to recognize. First of all, he's old school to a fault. This is a new world. When it comes to long term stock investing I'll reread The Intelligent Investor every two years and never fail to buy a new edition (though there hasn't been one in a decade) and I'll even consult my WB check list for swing trades. I follow his ten rules. 
But old generals want horseback cavalry and old admirals want wooden ships. Just look at the opening for the article. 


This is a man who famously stated you shouldn't invest in anything you don't understand. That counts for betting against something as well. I mean that's literally his FIRST rule of investing. This is a man who, I very much love him for this, mandates reading time for his employees every work day. Beautiful. But he hasn't learned anything about this thing he's poo-pooing. 
The other thing to remember about Warren is that *he is a public figure.* He represents, to the world, the traditional banking and investing system. He is not his own man anymore. Straight up - he could not endorse cryptocurrencies if he wanted to and OF COURSE he is going to be against the thing that is aiming to completely upend his world. It only makes sense. He, like all old men, want peace and calm and tranquility and stability. I'd be lying if I said it didn't appeal to me as well. But you can't stem the tide by wishing it weren't raining and the waters they are a-rising.

It's called a low volume pullback and it creates buying opportunities. It's consolidation 101. And yes it is preferable. When volume and price are tight together it means the market is finding a price it likes and not too many buys are happening at an 'inflated' price. You *generally* want volume to move in the same direction as price.
edit: just rechecked charts to make sure I wasn't bullshitting myself out of optimism. You can see quite clearly that volume is lower or smooth at price drops, higher during raises and peaks and reversals. Given how long the market rejected a sub 11.5k price the last day I'm actually surprised to wake up to a 10k bitcoin. Maybe it breaks that floor, too, maybe not, but with such strong support at all 1k and .5k levels I think it won't be easy. You can see also that whenever it reaches those lower prices there's invariably an immediate volume and price spike. People are looking to buy. Be brave, hodler.

Indica-sativa hybrid I am pretty sure. Nothing good around here. But, seriously, have a sit-down think as it seems you're literally in the position to do so. Look at what is happening. Cryptocurrency and blockchain literally makes banks obsolete. As soon as people decide they don't want to trust the untrustworthy, boom, banks will be gone like the snows of yesteryear. Banks do not want to stop existing, they have an incredibly lucrative and easy job that affords them not only great money but great power. First they try to just ignore crypto, then they try to stop it and then they realize they have to compete and the only way is to jump on board. The first two are history, the latter is contemporaneous. Genuinely the only service I can think of that a big bank offers that would be of any use to a crypto holder would be currency insurance, and that could be done by any insurer willing to use a secure wallet app, and then that would only ever be used by people who either don't trust themselves or perhaps have to go somewhere they just don't feel safe or won't have internet access like to a warzone or prison.
Ripple does nothing that banks don't already do. It ticks all the buttons and checks all the boxes of buzzwords. But, seriously, instant worldwide payment? Citi, TD, Schwab and probably a lot more banks and brokerages offer all that already. But it sounds cryptoesque. There's literally no reason to have that service as opposed to any other cross-bank exchange and even less reason to have a coin associated with it. It is, however, in a good place to be monetized as it's easily converted to fiat thanks to its bank associations and thus exchange circumvention. But anyone who values anonymity and owning their money wouldn't keep any value in it if they have any sense.

1. What has driven the rise: the network effect, FOMO, currency instability and the desire to be able to own our own money. Being able to transact between anyone, anywhere, without having to beg permission or pay exorbitant fees or convert between different pieces of paper with the faces of overlords on them.
2. Will the gains continue: yes, but I expect much slower than currently. Face it: kids love bitcoin. Kids are the future. Bitcoin is therefore the future. Who can blame them? Gold is shiny, but it's so darn heavy.
3. My interest: it's a great technology that enables self determination and liberty from financial governance. That is a beautiful thing. And I knew that when and if a gov't endorsed it it would have more legitimacy and power - Japan did and, boom, I saw myself proven right overnight. Feels good being right so I naturally followed it more. Then someone on this subreddit sent me a $1 tip via bitcoin and I was enamored. Besides that I just kept hearing my smartest friends explaining it to me like I was explaining Google to my family in 2008 and I realized I was on my way to being that old guy in the 1980s who could never get the vcr's clock to stop blinking 12 and I realized that it was just the beginning. And it still is.
4. Mainstream understanding: no. And they won't. They don't have the courage. Come gather round people wherever you roam and admit that the waters around you have grown. The times have changed. I am sure that blacksmiths never believed that they'd be the last of their kind. Bankers have a lot of their fundamental personality invested in their power structure. They believe in it, have been taught to their whole lives. Belief is a powerful thing... just look what it's done for bitcoin. They're like vampires watching the rising sun. They just can't believe it.

So far it's behaving just as I've predicted so I'm feeling comforted. The price jumped in anticipation of futures and fell some on launch and is holding steady during trading. I think there will be some more high volatility for a short time Thanks to betting on it speculatively and profit taking and cashing out and in thanks to new year tax liberties and then nice steady slow growth from the new 30 day moving average throughout 2018. This is my prediction and I've been wrong before.

Lenin was a communist. That's like Ford saying, "The purpose automation is mass production." The purpose of socialism is to ensure that the fruits of civilization are enjoyed by all. Lenin knew plenty about what *he called* communism, I am sure. In reality, that brand of Communism is what you get if socialism is perverted by corruption. That brand of Communism is actually capitalism with a different name.
As for socialist states that have failed, I think that first you should define 'failed' because a 'failed state' as dictated by the USA doesn't really fit any single criteria other than 'annoyed the USA.'
And you should also define socialist. I take it as meaning public welfare is administered or cared for by the state. For example the V.A. Libraries, roads, police, fire departments - social institutions. The more organs of the state there are acting honorably and for the good of the people as a whole the better off the people will be. Most of the nations of the past that have called themselves socialist have not had the welfare of the people in mind. That's really no different than capitalist states. 
Anyway so my rambling point is this: Canada is socialist. Israel is socialist. Costa Rica, Vietnam, most of the spots north of the wall (Norway, Sweden). Switzerland isn't, interestingly, I thought they were. But they do have one incredibly beautiful socialised institute: Their voting system. Everyone can vote on any issue. Their politicians aren't there to vote for them, they are there to educate them. It's probably that which keeps overly powerful corporations at bay. Beautiful, really, that every worker in every company can vote on the rules that will effect them.

I got in about two months ago. I always thought Bitcoin was really cool and great and had a ton of promise. Then I bought in... and cared a ton more about the price, for obvious reasons. And caring about the price made me care more about the value and learn much more about it.
Caring about the price is *good.* Self interest is possibly the world's best motivator. Unfortunately most people are not altruistic. But don't confuse price with value, though the price should hypothetically reflect the value - it's really just a valu*ation*. Remember - Donald Trump is "worth" a billion dollars or more.

The CBOE / CME websites can answer that but the basic thing is call a broker and ask, "Do you offer bitcoin futures trading?" and if they say yes, open an account. You will probably need more than $25,000 to do it - that's the day trading minimum set by the SEC so it's a standard benchmark for 'I have enough money to play with.'


Yes. Whether or not he can or will is another story. He shouldn't have much trouble. Besides that if he's a real worker he could reach out to holders and make contracts FOR you.


Sure, I did actually in part two there. But here you go: When the price of a contract is higher than the price of the coin itself just buy the coin and sell the contract at the same time. Instant money. You're selling the upward potential, so your profit is limited but your risk is nil for the term of the contract.


Each exchange will have its own symbol. I think the CBOE one right now is F8, G8 and H8. Check their website for the actual ones. Yes, you can buy and sell them thus trading them. Front month liquidity yesterday was 22000+ contracts so you should have NO problem trading it around.


You can do that but like I said, no need to hold on to it if the gamble's going wrong or you think you've made all you could.

Ripple exists to kill decentralized crypto. I would not be surprised to learn they fund Roger Ver or his accomplices. Divide and conquer is very real and banks and governments think far, far ahead.

You're not wrong but the problem is probably as much ignorance as animosity. I mean the wording of the bill just shows how uneducated the writers are... the idea of "moving" crypto "across borders" is so ignorant it borders on moronic. Crypto doesn't move. It doesn't exist in any specific place. This is exactly why I am against trezor style physical wallets. It gives some authority figure something to point at and say look, see, the crypto is right there. Meanwhile really the crypto is anywhere.
All crypto is is a recorded agreement. It exists everywhere the ledger exists. So, what, we're supposed to pay tariffs and border duties on every purchase or exchange of bitcoin to every country in the world because it's crossed every border in the world? The whole thing is ducking ludicrous.
So now we have this bill that can be interpreted basically any way anybody wants for no reason. It's already illegal to do any of the illegal things someone might want to do with "concealed cryotocurrency." Making a new law that is literally unenforceable does what?!

That's not exactly how that happened, but yeah, bitcoin isn't fast. Frankly I think it's better, politically, that bitcoin not threaten national currencies which are usually, and will probably remain, the best way to buy something face to face or from an online vendor.
Bitcoin's best use cases, and what it does better than any bank or national currency, are:
1. Buying something prohibited (locally, regionally, internationally) as long as you've got a truly anonymous wallet.
2. Purchasing for business (especially internationally). Anywhere a vendor can turn BTC into their local currency is happy to take it for an order of, say, 100,000 t shirts or 100 laptops or a combine tractor.
3. Long term Forex
4. Cooperative financial concerns (such as incorporating, again especially internationally)
5. Internet odd-jobs (and this is my favorite. If you want to employ someone to take photos for your 'venezuelan crisis' blog and capitalize on the buzz you bet your ass you do NOT want to buying Bolivars, baby)
And so on and so forth. And that is why we don't have to give a fuck what the whining companies whine about. We can do it ourselves. We *should* do it ourselves. The only problem is that 99% of the time when someone tries to implement an improvement they make a fucking ICO and brand new tech unrelated to any other coin and so every single coin is stuck on the ground floor.
And. That. Is. Stupid. A coin must rise, and the only coin attempting that now is Bitcoin. All the others are working on their basic novel use scenario and Bitcoin is the only one trying to improve to a whole new level from a solid foundation.
Anyway, point is, getting 400 people together to create and fund and operate a good segwit enabled, lightning ready exchange and node education / creation society should be easy AF for anyone willing to pay in bitcoin.

A lot more of a killing to make on the up side than the down. Up is infinite. Down is limited to current price. Could a few whales cause a vacuum short fall? Sure. But not really a lot of one unless people panic. The real reason to short would be to buy back long at a floor. Why would they sabotage something with so much potential? Makes no sense. They know better than anyone it's better to sheer a sheep than skin it and that's what *commissions on derivatives do.*

I remember one day in college some religious fanatics were coming out to support their candidate for President and after they were done canvassing they sat down in the student center waiting for their rides and the leader guy was talking to me and to prove something about the uselessness of science he asked me if there was a formula to calculate when the hands on a clock would cross each other within a given hour or something like that. I said, of course there is.
Immediately his follower kid jumped up with NO THERE ISN'T! THAT'S JUST STUPID!
And I calmly said, "I am sure there is. You seem very concerned with seeming smart."
I admitted I didn't know the formula and the first guy says ah something you don't know. And I say there's lots of things I don't know, but at least *I don't pretend they don't exist.* And the next day my friend came to me with the formula he got from one of the cool young professors.

@_date: 2017-12-15 14:08:13
Look at volume vs. price over a period of time. If volume holds steady or rises and price stays the same, that's the floor rising. How strong that floor is depends on the mindset of the people buying. People seem to be buying quite enthusiastically - doesn't seem a correction of such a large magnitude is 'probably' going to happen. Don't forget that bitcoin is still going through price discovery and when it jumps in price then falls back a little people think, "WOW what a deal now..." the new 1 week low near the 1 month high looks like the new floor to a lot of people. A *correction* doesn't happen in those circumstances.

*sigh* the contracts must be backed by actual bitcoin. In the (unlikely) event that the cboe/cme went under the coins themselves would have to be delivered. The connection is there, it's real, the coins have to be held for each contract outstanding even though it's cash settled.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:56:42
You are 99.9% correct. By the rules of the Options Clearance Corporation (by whose rules this is governed) the market making body (in this case the CBOE) has to have enough liquidity to cover outstanding contracts. That means that if they're stuck bag holding because the price went up and not enough people sold and lots of people bought and that means they owe more money than they have that they'd have to find a way to make more money to pay off. It's all cash settled.
The easiest way to ensure they have all the liquidity they need? Hold the bitcoin. If they don't have the cash, just deliver the coin itself. Or, they can sell the coin as it's an asset with a 1:1 correlation to the price of the contract.
I haven't read their agreement with the OCC but I am sure they have to hold a certain amount of bitcoin for exactly this purpose, or the exchanges they're working with keep enough for them, etc.

One of my best friends sent me Facebook PM, "Want to see a dead body?" then a picture. It was a screenshot of 2 bitcoins bought at $1,000 each and a transfer of them to another wallet - his brother's. He was nervous about having them and gave them to his brother who almost definitely immediately sold them.
Missed opportunities happen. It sucks. Resilience is key, as is appreciating what you already have. If you can't do that you'll never be happy. There's never any 'happily ever after.' Either you're satisfied or you're not, and no amount of money will change that. It can ease pressure, sure, but - and I am damn sorry to be harsh here - something else in your brother's life would have probably driven him to suicide later. Either he'd sell 'too early' and get only one yacht instead of two or he'd lose a loved one or anything else. 
What's important is how *you deal with your grief.* There's a lot of hard shit about getting older but the hardest, and I'm quoting Cormac McCarthy here, is "accepting that not everybody will get to do it with you." His pain is over. Yours is just beginning. It's good you're trying to cope, but the loss of a loved one isn't something you get over quickly or completely.
If you're lucky you will get old. Your bones will ache and you'll wake up to piss three times a night and your older relatives may forget their own names or yours. But that's what life is: Survival and decay. Enjoy the good shit and if you get rich, all the better, it'll help you live well a little longer. But I promise you it cannot make you happy.

The ELI5 is best left to investopedia but I'll give it a shot. 
This is generally regarded as good news. You may understand why in a second.
**Edit: This is getting a little popular so I want to clarify something: The contract size of 1 futures contract on the CBOE is (I think) 5 bitcoins. It is that on one of the exchanges. So the example I give below is not numerically, but is philosophically, correct. - Fuck Danny.**
So, the CBOE is allowing people to bet on the price of bitcoin in the future. Check out the prices [here.](
The CBOE is acting a holder of bitcoin and trader of, essentially, gambling slips on the price of bitcoin. A futures contract is an agreement to buy something (bitcoin here) later at a specific price. This is great for markets with price movements because it allows people to be secure in the price of a thing and therefore do planning regarding that price.
Imagine a car manufacturer needs aluminum at $100 a ton in order to charge a reasonable amount for their cars. So they agree to pay that for the next year and some broker or trader agrees to sell it for that to them next year. That same broker or trader then has two options - own that aluminum and sell it at that price (which is great is the price is falling as they can buy it cheaper and make money) or find some aluminum holder / producer who will sell it cheaper and lock in a price. Say, $95 a ton. Then that trader makes $5 a ton next year on however much aluminum he sold to the car manufacturer and moves on to finding more trades to make.
Same thing with bitcoin. The CBOE is the broker (exchange) and I (TDA account holder) believe bitcoin will be $20,000 next month. Fuckin' A, look at that, the current contract price is $18,090. If I buy that contract right now then I believe my profit will be $2000. Hell yeah I'm going to buy that.
Now Danny Downer thinks bitcoin will be at $16,000 next month. Fuck him, right? But hey he has a right to his opinion and furthermore he may be right (the fucker) so he SELLS that contract. CBOE is happy with that because no matter what happens they made a commission price and offset their risk on the price movement. Think about the outcomes.
The price of bitcoin stays exactly at $18,090. I buy it at that price, Danny sells it at that price and the real price is $18090 and neither of us make or lose anything. Worse scenarios exist but nobody gets laid.
Scenario two, Danny is right! Fuck Danny! Danny sold me Bitcoin at $18090 and since it's trading at $17090 I owe that fuck $1,000 which the CBOE gives him and takes from me.
Scenario three, I'm right. Fuck Danny! Bitcoin settles at $20,090 and Danny sells me bitcoin at $18,090 but he has to buy it at $20,090 first thus losing $2000 while I gain $2,000. I'd rather have the bitcoin but the contract is cash settled so I get boring old dollars instead, such is life. I can of course take those dollars and spend them on bitcoin should I so desire.
Now, why is this good or bad for bitcoin? It's good because I can secure a price for bitcoin *right now.* I can buy 3 bitcoin and sell a contract on 1 of them, locking in a guaranteed price (usually higher than the current price) on that one and thus taking that much less risk on the overall position. And if I should have to pay out on that because the price rises? Cry me a river - the price of the asset rose. I made money, and still own the underlying bitcoins and thus continue to make money on a rising price.
This is risk reduction, and that makes for a more attractive investment.
There's a ton of things you can do like this, lots of options and futures strategies. Another good thing is that since this is happening on a fast, secure and well monitored platform it can help price discovery and trading move very very quickly. Furthermore people will become more acclimated to bitcoin as a 'thing' and trading it and everything else. It'll be more a part of their consciousness. 
What will the effect be? My opinion is that it'll drive greater investment.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:01:57
You may be right. I expect short term high volatility, I suspect it to be in the upward direction. Really a lot depends on the first few days, weeks, months. A trend has to be established and that will determine the long term future. It's all market psychology.

Most people won't even know what happened. Three days, a week from now things will be back to healthy growth. Bcash may reach a new floor price but it'll lose a ton of equity that'll probably (IMHO) end up in LTC and ETH. They don't have anything of value to offer, just a cult of personality. LN starts, they become redundant even more than they already are and all those efforts are for naught. Why do you think they're doing all this *now*? Difficulty goes up, new futures markets open, the public is watching and getting interested - it's completely opportunistic.
If I had to guess why they can pull this off it's the real reason Ver holds BTC. He said his reasoning was "because he could be wrong" but the real reason is so he can try to manipulate the market. There are indeed whales in this sea and, luckily for us, they don't all agree.

I've been watching GDAX out of pure, morbid fascination and noticed a couple of trends. My favorite is the ginormous BCH sell off but that's because I have a bit of schadenfreude asshole in me. Looking at the BTC depth chart I've noticed things others have mentioned but now seen with my own eyes.
One thing I noticed that nobody else showed me (but may have written before) is that it seems we have a whole lot of crocodile buyers. I mean, ambush buyers. You can watch a big sell wall encourage the price lower with timid, low buy volume and then a huge influx of purchasing as the price falls. Lots of very active traders watching close, not putting their money in the order book until they get a great deal. I'm loving it, really, it shows high attention and a good news for future pricing. 
After this happens there's usually a big retreat from the sell side as they realize what's going on (I believe) and then a push back from that side with another trapping low volume buy side... gives the impression of a war, truly, but the most interesting take away is watching the sell side give up so so easily. It truly gives the impression of attempted manipulation without confidence. Too soon to call it but I'm guessing there'll be a mass retreat of the sell side soon and another try at another big landmark event like a difficulty adjustment or Roger Ver announcing he is running for President of cuntville.

So, here is a solution. Set up a fund consisting of you and ten or twenty friends / recruits. Call yourself "reliable debt collection." Pool all your money. Call debt collection agencies in your local area (you must be local to one another) and tell them you're in the market for absolute dogshit, but legitimate, debt. You want stuff that's in default, hasn't seen a payment in years. You'll probably end up paying 1 to 3 percent of the value. Then you sift through that data for you and your friends' names and find whatever debt applies to you and forgive it. If none of your stuff is there you go through the list and find info on the rest of debtors. Look for people whose debt is simply unpayable at their income level. Look for student loans, medical, variable rate mortgages. Not car loans for expensive cars. Not tools and not business yet. No payday loans.
Call these people up and tell them you're going to forgive their debt, no more calls or letters if they just listen to you for five minutes and ask questions after. If they say no ask permission to mail them or call back. If they say no go through the whole list before you bother them again. Be friendly, personal and courteous. Write down anything personal they tell you. BE FRIENDLY AND CONSCIENTIOUS. 
If they say you can write, have your explanation written out. Nice paper. If they agree to listen explain you are gathering funds to eliminate debt, they don't have to pay for theirs to be eliminated but if they pay the same percent you paid that they've already paid for you doing this for them and that if they pay double they've paid for someone else. If two people pay 1.5 times their amount they've paid for another person, etc. 
Understand you're telling these people that they could eliminate a 10,000 debt for $100. Good god damn deal. Take literally any donation they offer and thank them. Keep them on your holiday cards list. Remind them they're not in debt anymore and tell them the stories of others who are also not in debt. Explain how you did it and explain they can do it, too.

While your paper delivery accomplishments are highly impressive, it seems that your incredible achievement in the delivery arts have left you out of touch with the common man. Money means different things to different people. That $100 may or may not be a lot of money to this guy but, regardless, it seems to matter to them. Perhaps since you don't care about such a sum you should send it to them. I'm sure they'd be happy to have the donation. Still, the question remains, if this is such an insignificant event why would you bother to comment in such at all? Simply to obnoxiously try to assert your superiority? Why not help instead?

I might have been unclear. I don't think it's okay for a big withdrawal to take a long time unless it's been confirmed on both ends and it is known from the start that's what's going to happen. If I were OP I'd be concerned about them having trouble liquidating my position and I'd be similarly upset about the difference in price. I might also be concerned this was due to some government shenanigans or bank shenanigans regarding reporting or investigation. I think they have a responsibility to report accurately but taking so long with so much is exactly what would drive some people to sell to some Arab oil sheik instead of to their bank.

Marx didn't invent socialism, he just gave it a new name. The ideas that became socialism existed before the French Revolution, but it was that event that created it.
Anyway all those things that existed, no, they didn't exist in their current form before socialism. As a matter of fact many of them weren't administered to by governments or non-profits even after socialism was popular. Police were shire reeves, vassals to a lord. Libraries were private. Fire departments were a form of capital insurance and would often fight each other over territory. The VA? Are you kidding me? LOL. Oh brother, you're delusional. 
And, no, "nobility" was the beginning of capitalism. That's actually where capitalism and socialism have their big, original split. Capitalists say, "This is my land and if you want to use it you have to pay me to do so." That was England in the 1400s. A farmer barely kept the 10th share of what they grew for self or sale. A socialist says, "This is our land and we use it for our common good. We have 100 families here we all take care of each other." One results in a guy in a castle with a bunch of peasants toiling their entire lives to enrich him, church and king and the other results in a nice village that takes good care of itself.
Mao and your other examples aren't socialist. They were *state capitalist* claiming to be socialist just like the USA is a layered republic claiming to be a democracy. In socialism all the people own the wealth of their nation. Everyone has a stake, everyone has an obligation and everyone gets a piece. Looking at the state buildings of those empires vs. the poverty of the individuals you can tell that's not the case in any of the places you mentioned.
Of course, in the nations that I did mention you can see how it can work quite marvelously. Again - Canada, Israel, Vietnam, most of Scandinavia... I mean, they are just doing better at so many things. And yes, people there decide how to use their own capital in all those places. No government man comes to the door and says, "This car is our capital for to haul the rutabagas." Your car is yours. Your home is yours. Not sure why you think otherwise.

The value of Bitcoin is not to be confused with its price. The value is security, utility and liberty. The price is determined by what people will pay for that value and as well as speculating upon its future price.

Socialism is about distributing the wealth of a nation (group of people) for social benefit. It's not *about* the ownership of means of production - or for that matter distribution - that's just a defining characteristic. Socialists would be just as happy with there being no ownership of such things and only stewardship.
A good example are the socialist systems we have in the USA. Road systems, the mail, the library, the police and fire departments. You know - the stuff that makes a society functional. Lots more stuff used to be completely socialist as well. Prisons, for example. A whole bunch more stuff the military did.
But if you look at those things you'll notice that the means of production and distribution of the things those entities use aren't owned by the people of the USA or the state. While the police, libraries and and roads departments can operate at a financial loss for the good of the people of the country, the firearm manufacturers, publishers, road repair companies and so on and so forth cannot. 
Things can be socialised to varying degrees and with very different effects on their society. So when I say the principles, I mean the principle that, for example, prison and healthcare won't be left up to the profit motive *out of principle.*

It really won't. I hate posting stuff like this because it might get me on a list or something but anyone who thinks about it - and money launderers I am sure think about it a lot more than me - would have hundreds of easy ways to launder money. Not to mention it really doesn't matter where in the world you are when it comes to bitcoin.
But hypothetically lets say some NK agent in SK wanted to launder money. All he'd have to do, if he wanted to avoid the ID requirement, would be to go through a straw man. And if a NK agent who already had an ID wanted to conceal money movement he'd just have to do the simplest shuffling between a few different cryptos and that's it.

All contracts in all things assume everyone keeps their word. Pretty sure you know that.
edit: Right, just in case anyone read this and was impressed by this guy's comment. It's mumbo jumbo. He throws out a lot of terms that, actually, I did cover in the body of the text. 
* Delivery mechanism? Of the futures contract, that's the brokerage you're using. 
* Convergence is a pricing trend. It doesn't rely on a contract to force it. It just refers to how the futures contract price approaches the actual price of the asset. For example if the bitcoin contract were expiring in an hour you wouldn't pay $10,000 above or below the current price of bitcoin, obviously, because you wouldn't believe it would move that much in that period of time. As expiration draws closer, convergence becomes tighter.
* as far as manipulation, the market *is* manipulation. Untoward manipulation can occur on any asset, cash or physically settled, or any contract. Sure, Gemini or a player could manipulate their bitcoin price. You really think if the price of btc on Gemini was hugely different than on the other American exchanges that nobody would notice? They're part of the futures market now and being watched by the SEC and OCC - yeah, I wouldn't concern myself with it too much.
* The forward curve doesn't at all apply to my post. Yeah, it's good to understand. Great to help you plan a buy or sell... but why bring it up? Just to throw shade? For those of you who want to know what it is, it's just a potential direction and amount the price of a contract *can* move in a given amount of time.
* Contango and backwardization's drivers are absolutely unimportant. For those of you who don't know, these terms refer to the two situations I described above: When the future price is higher than the spot price and vice versa. What creates these situations is market sentiment and the asset's previous price movements. Again, not an issue that impacts risk if your futures are covered by your bitcoin holdings.


I would suggest you stop trying to sound impressive and start trying to help your fellow coiners.

Every time you throw a die it comes up 6. The odds of it landing 6 again is still 1 in 6. This is a random event. Every day the sun rises in the east. It does so because of antecedent conditions. You note the sun rises in the east every day and so every day it becomes more apparent that this *not* a random event. How do you test this? You make a hypothesis and test it. The sun must rise in the east you suggest because the world is round and rotates. So you set a pole in the earth and measure the shadow and note how it moves based upon the direction of the sun. And how it changes day to day week to week month to month and over time you can predict the length of days, the position of the sun the next day and so on. You note the correlation between that and the position of the stars at night. And on and on.
Conditions stay the same. And so do results. They are reliable, testable, replicable.
Statistics assumes that the underlying causes of a thing remain the same and thus continuing events can predict future instances and iterations. N is small in Bitcoin, but it is such in the stock market as well. We can say what has always happened, and since really there hasn't been a big environmental change we can say what ought to happen again. We can measure the shadows to find the sun's position tomorrow. We can see the changing of the seasons. And since bitcoin depends on perception, our collective perception and thus behavior will move it in the direction we reasonably expect it to go.

Well it's true, is the thing. They drove us insane with a war of attrition in Vietnam thanks to Eisenhower promising anti-communist support in 1955. Then we did basically the same thing in Afghanistan but to them. The fact is that we were simply better positioned to drive them into the dirt thanks to our post WW2 positions. The other big difference is that we weren't aggressive in Vietnam, not in terms of territory. And it cost a lot more to kill an American soldier in Vietnam than it did to kill five Russians in Afghanistan. But the Russians *just couldn't quit.* They required the image of power in conquest to hold down the republics... they failed in Afghanistan, ruined their image, lost all kinds of hardware to circa 1960s equipment. And that was the end of the USSR. If they'd had the strength to attack us directly it might have gone the other way.

Steal a big amount of money and show up at work with a new car or fancy clothes or start taking nice vacations or eating out every day while the cops are watching you and when they get a warrant for your phone or computer there's the whole record... dude.

Your comments illustrate your ignorance of the the secondary debt market. The prices have been set. The market is huge and the prices are tiny. Even if the prices started to rise they'd still be insanely cheap. And it would be a simple matter to just... stop. And wait. For the prices to fall again.
But to keep the prices from rising all you'd have to do is only by from original lenders and not rebuyers, thus eliminating competition and negating the effect of supply limitation... which would be negligible as more and more is created every second.
Seriously, why do people like you troll and sound off when they are so ignorant?

Looks like less fud this time around, which is nice but not hugely surprising seeing how the btc community is so resilient.

You're not wrong but you will be. Crypto is slowing. It has aged quickly and will (in my crystal ball) continue to. As it matures, it will slow. Also, bitcoin is almost certain to lose a ton of marketshare even as its price rises. It's being mined more and more slowly. Fewer and fewer coins being produced while younger alts have the advantage in this. For BTC to maintain its current marketshare the price will have to rise exponentially. It's a good market indicator that BTC has a bigger piece of a rapidly expanding pie.

Cheaper and faster, not better, and only as long as they're not popular. Bcash has serious security flaws. But really that's not that important. The fact is it won't be mass adopted because it requires Bitcoin to fail to prove it's point and if Bitcoin dies crypto goes with it. By the time that's not the case it'll be completely redundant. At any rate, adoption itself spurs adoption - nobody is going to abandon Bitcoin for bcash because vastly more people and merchants take Bitcoin than any other crypto and virtually none will take only bcash, or any other crypto, and *not* take Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin, to mostly everyone, is 100% synonymous with cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is classic Coke. Bcash isn't even RC Cola and the closest thing to Pepsi is Litecoin and they're cooperative! Get it? Here: Bitcoin is the continental USA. Bcash is Mexico and Litecoin is Canada.

Definitely not a shitcoin. I actually think is really, really big news. First off it's backed by oil, gas, gold and diamonds. Gold and diamonds are sort of a shit backing especially with man-made diamonds now flooding the market from China but oil and gas are a *big big deal*. A lot of interesting, huge, and far-reaching consequences can come from this development.
First off, if bitcoin can be easily exchanged for the Petro that's going to mean that gas, oil, diamonds and gold will be able to be purchased in massive quantities directly from a producer via bitcoin. Think deeper: Imagine they peg 1 Petro to 1 barrel of oil. That gives a hard line basis for bitcoin valuation *and* a higher price for oil. 
Things can get pretty surreal pretty soon. The Petro might even be the most stable crypto in the coming years. And if they use it to buy and sell oil to Russia, China, Japan... well, there goes the USA's financial supremacy *or* here comes war.

And they do so solely on threat of destitution if they don't. Get sick? Lose your house. Our current economic paradigm is horrific. Can you imagine anything other than violence - as in the case of slavery, or debt - as in the case of wage slavery, that could convince a human to sit in a cube and perform a redundant task for the best part of their life? And to make the right to do that, or to work a dangerous, pointless job that could easily be done by a machine, a selling point for politicians?

It has incredible uses cross-border, it's better for vendors and for very large transactions (such as actual shipment of physical commodities). To be more useful for that it needs the wide consumer base. It'll continue to have more and more of that as the world progresses - the future isn't segregation, we're getting ever more connected and that's why crypto is necessary and desirable.
Does that mean the BTC price will necessarily rise? No. But I believe it will. In the USA, as I've written I don't know how many times, we don't really see the need for Bitcoin because, 1., we are largely ignorant of what money is and how it works. We Americans... well, we don't really care to explore how things work as long as they do. We're too stuck in our grind, trying to survive and pay our debts and get ahead in our horrible corporations to care. And, 2., we can use the USD basically everywhere within the entire continent with no issues whatsoever.

No not just investigations. It's not a paradox at all. There are predictable effects of news events on price. Nations do dramatic, news making things. People with loads of money make them do those dramatic things. Some of them are interested in bitcoin. Others in oil. Others in other financial markets. Etc, etc. They do things that make news knowing what the effect will be. This may or may not be unethical, depending on what the motivation for the actions was, and how necessary it was. They do have responsibilities after all. What would make it sort of criminal would be if the manipulation was enriching the rulers of one nation at the expense of its own people or allies. Whether they would think so would depend on the laws of their own nation but, fact: corruption is rife around the world.

You can think whatever you want to think, as right or wrong as it is. Nobody is worried about what you think.

I think you are referring to the aggressive, intentional split of, first, S2X then Bcash. Allow it? Wouldn't attempting to stop it be some sort of evil censorship?

Stop falling for republican/conservative style fear and division tactics.

Jump? My point was that all the other altcoins are competing directly with BTC as well and BCH has as much ability to compete on its merits as any of the other altcoins out there.
To be clear, I am not saying that any one coin is better than any other. Not only is 'better' subjective, it's too easy for people to argue about it all day. It's a fact that BCH is **not inherently**, thanks to its technology, faster, more secure, cheaper or in any way superior to Bitcoin. But so what? What if it was? What if it didn't even have its inherent flaws like an "emergency" difficulty adjustment? The "better" technology doesn't always win. Laserdisc wasn't better or worse than DVD. DVD won. Shoelaces aren't inherently better than Velcro or snaps or buttons - shoelaces won. Hemp is better by almost every metric than wood, oil and concrete... and look at how that worked out so far!
Straight up, BCH's only argument is that BTC is crap and since everyone knows that's a lie, well, you can see how that's a bit of a problem for BCH. Frankly I couldn't care less how BCH does. I think that as people get more educated they'll all come to the same conclusion. It's the same conclusion that anyone has when they go to chinatown and see Goochie and Adoodas and Popsi and Candia Dry. Trying to fob itself off as something it's not and borrow the name recognition shows everyone who will look that that's all they've got. It devalues itself.

Ver is a moron. His trolls and his own rhetoric is self defeating. They call Bcash "Bitcoin". Fine. So, just make them the offer to sell them any amount of "Bitcoin, the real bitcoin," at 50% of the BTC price. Receive money, send BCH, how can they complain?
If they stick to their guns, great, not only do you make a tidy profit but those morons win as well because what is happening is essentially arbitrage. As long as there are buyers it'll raise the BCH price as people buy BCH to take advantage. If they do complain - and admit they're full of shit - then you can refund them whatever they want, minus transaction fees, and have their admission of lying on record.

The more you try, the dumber you seem, with all your insults and bluster you really just come off as an ignorant child.
Modern iOS and Android systems encrypt your entire device if you but ask, and it's extremely hard to get into your files without your passcode. Not sure why you would claim AAntonop said differently when I literally linked him speaking words that would contradict what you say he said... are you saying he can't keep his own story straight? I'd really like to see your link to AA saying that. Please do send it. Meanwhile the new video you link says that we give up security, letting our phones spy on us - no shit. What's the camera and location permissions have to do with wallet security? He was talking about privacy being voluntarily compromised. Lord. Why do you even bother when you just make yourself look dumb?
You must be a really special sort of person.

"manipulation has occurred and will occur" != "this is manipulation." Everything in your video that isn't completely verifiable is complete speculation and frankly seems far fetched. If one exchange wanted to raise the price of Bitcoin it wouldn't look like this at all. The price would rise on that one exchange and as a result the volume on that exchange would fall, then pick up as arbitrage poured in, and then it would deflate slowly. It'd be very easy to spot.
Ever consider this is the result of movement of other cryptocurrencies due to taxation and regulation concerns such as on ETH? How about influx of money away from Gemini due to fees rising? How about new BTC ATMs, vendors, news, algorithmic traders, etc., etc., etc.?
Sure, it could be manipulation. It could be intentional buying at an established support level to increase the price - that could be happening inside or outside an exchange. Or it could be people intentionally colluding to drive up the price. Or whales. Or a school of hammerheads. Or minnows.

I have no idea. I doubt it, since any valuation could be considered arbitrary I suppose. But I don't feel 9,000 is an arbitrary level. To my mind 8800 - 9200 is an important level that has been resistance and support at strong value and multiple bounces a few times. It's an important sentimental level.
Technical analysis on BTC is squidgy at best and absolutely pointless at worst. It's based entirely on demand vs supply and the supply of buyable coins is *also* based on demand. Being such a young asset with such fast moving adoption means having to constantly reevaluate chart patterns as new traders / investors / speculators / adopters behave differently. 
The 5500, 7000 and 9000 zones saw a lot of action and strength and I for one see them as indicative of floor levels forming. I specifically look at 8000 seeming to be the new 7000 and thus a higher low showing an uptrend.
I would draw channels now between 8.5k and 9.5k (yes, a stupidly wide channel, but hey, BTC is volatile!) and call anything inside there sideways.
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:51:46
Depends at what price they buy in, if they keep it or sell it, if it's used or traded or neither, etc. If they all bought at once it wouldn't really do much at all because that's not actually much volume. If they did it steadily and over time and kept their interests and passion up then the price would rise. If they only bought as the price was falling then the price would remain steady or continue to fall. It's really about what price people are willing to sell it for vs. willing to buy it for.
What we want to see is a whole bunch of people getting a little lightbulb over their head and realizing that bitcoin is 10x better than any other solution for traveling, or some other use case. Which it is. It's infinitely better. The first pump was the Silk Road. Hopefully the next is restaurants in foreign lands. Who wants to lose money on foreign exchange when you can spend BTC instead?

Seen it dozens of times. They survive unless they're shilling altcoins like what you refer to as "bitcoin" cash and what I will heretofore refer to as unwashed assholes.


Then you don't know what hijack means, or how bitcoin works.


Both are censorship, whether or not you think either is reasonable or good. So would be banning CP. Of course, nobody is banned from for having a different opinion. But you will get banned for shilling unwashed assholes. You can believe unwashed assholes are a great coin. You can love them. Heck, I love boobs - I don't come here to discuss boobs or sell my gf's boob pictures.

Sure. Their entire rhetoric is based upon the idea that BTC is dead, broken, failing, not competitive, slow, can't scale, unusable, etc. That's their only selling point. It's all a lie. They're relying entirely on competing with BTC for their value... but they offer no unique value proposition.
In reality they're competing with every single altcoin without a single innovation. They're not faster than Dash or even Doge. They're not more useful than Eth. They're not more X than Y. BCH is just another poopcoin, truly. All it has is trying to confuse people into thinking it's Bitcoin. And it's not. It's like if you bought Popcorn Cash and got Peanuts. If you never saw Popcorn or Peanuts before you might be fooled for a while, but as long as popcorn is out there you're going to learn the truth.

1. The *bank transfer* field has little to nothing to do with Bitcoin. Why would any entities trading in Bitcoin refer to anyone in the bank transfer field for information? Why would they provide it? Makes 0 sense whatsoever.
2. Even if you did work with or communicate with these companies, NGOs and governments you wouldn't be communicating with many, would you? One guy working at a desk in a bank is polling the CFOs and FS of the world? Come on. You're full of crap.

Yes - give a discount for using BTC instead of CC or have items that are available *exclusively* for BTC. This will further demand for Bitcoin, however minorly it does so, and give you the chance to create a dialog about BTC and crypto in general. Also, be absolutely sure that you explain on your 'about' or 'payments' page as it relates to BTC that ONLY BTC is Bitcoin and to make sure that any coins sent to you are the correct currency as you cannot accept any other coins to a BTC address.
If you want to accept other cryptos be SURE to disambiguate. If anyone says "But ___ is Bitcoin" you'll have to explain it's not.

These days, among the middle and upper class, 'sin sod' is more of a formality than anything else done just for show. The working or lower classes tend to care about it and keep it because, well, they have less money. A lower class girl of exceptional beauty with her 'honor' intact might get her mom $5,000 and some gold. If she's all that and young, and she can cook, and she is expected to inherit land then $12,000. Often the price is higher if you're a foreigner because it's perceived you're inferior or less desirable and also rich (why else would a Thai woman want you?). 
Upper class sin sod can be incredibly expensive. Luxury cars, houses, suitcases full of money. But generally it's just for show and is returned and is just a way to show you can take care of the lady you are removing from her home.

The HMS Nakamoto, captained by Lt. Commander Herbert Satoshi plowed ahead through the night. The sentiment on deck was one of grim, hopeful determination. Major General Frankburt von Happenstance's steaming breath plumed behind him, the only clue to the forward momentum of the venerable old ship through the dark of the eternal arctic night.
"Do you ever think we'll find it, old boy?" the general asked to himself. It was First Mate Pappy 'Poopdeck' Popshtein who replied, though.
"Oh, we'll find it, Sir. Don't you mind yerself about that. You see the miners today, Sir? They can smell it. Like cryptocurrency truffle hogs they is, Sir. We must be close - nearly had to call the Marines to quarters to hold 'em back just earlier. Thank Neptune we had the ganja store open or we'd never've..."
"That'll be enough, Pappy. It was rhetorical. Wait. What's that, ahead, in the distance?" The major thumbed the radio at his shoulder to hail the bridge. All assembled held their breath. Though not long. It's not easy to hold your breath, really, try it sometime. The radarman, Tina, came back with the report - it was an iceberg. Just another of many. But the major knew differently. "Scramble the lidar chopper. I've got a feeling."
The lidar chopper was a thing to behold. As the old saying goes an airplane takes to the skies on aerodynamics and grace while helicopters beat the air into submission. Ol' Lion was the epitome of that rule. Bright yellow, huge rotors and what looked like the spotlight meant to illuminate a stage for the gods. Watching it lift off would and strike forward would kindle the spark of technological wonderment in any man. Or, as Poopdeck would put it, "'Oly fuckin' shite it weren't meant to fly."
The berg was big, much bigger and far distance than the Major General had realized, he now saw, as the lion grew tiny and silent in the distance. He retired to the bridge to await the images... and in they came. Ice, miles of it, and in the center a glowing golden circle emblazoned with a slashed B.
Gentlemen, he said, awaken our captain. Bring up the champagne. And release the miners.

I post about BTC to facebook. I write my friends. I tell everyone I meet: Buy bitcoin. I disclose I own bitcoin and, no, they cannot buy mine. They must buy their own. Why? Because the more people invested the violent the price swings will be and the more people buying in the faster the price will rise.
Tell your family, tell your friends, explain it's a bit risky but you're happy to be gambling at the moment and it's worked out well for you and make sure you tell them that nobody can predict the future and they may lose every penny but if they take the price of a dinner out every week for a year and invest it and then don't eat out they might be damn happy and at worst they'll have to learn to cook better food.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:48:11
Well, no, not pedantic so much as incorrect. And I have no idea why you have such a strange definition of gambling, but so be it. The real mystery is why you'd chime in to begin with when the original comment was that 'in this case cashing out to fiat is gambling' in contrast to keeping it in bitcoin being not gambling. Seems utterly pointless.
Gambling implies greater risk and uncertainty than simply taking a common chance. Inhaling carries a non-zero risk of breathing in a virus that will multiply and kill you. Nobody of any sense would call breathing gambling. It means playing a game of chance usually for money. Literally, it is derived from the words for gaming or playing. Games with high risk. To be gambling, the risk has to be about what would be the same in a game like that.
So you meant to say "Everything has some element of risk." Fine. That's true. Maybe just say that instead of being contrary for no reason other than argument's sake.

Happy to amuse you but if you think going from about $100,000 to $1,000,000 without calling ahead is wise then please feel free. $1,000,000 is a lot less in regular banking than it is in crypto and you'd never consider a volume jump like that without consulting your bank first or doing it in person. If you'd done it before that'd be one thing, but even when I deposited my first big check which was not close to 1 million I got a call from my bank manager making sure that nobody was impersonating me or spoofing my phone and I use quite a big bank.
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:37:38


Bit off topic, I see where you're going with that, but I have to say it's not true. If skill were the main deciding factor in poker it wouldn't be poker. It'd be snooker or darts. But the analogy doesn't hold even if it were true because you're not playing against the community in BTC. At any rate your argument defeats itself - you say certainty isn't better then uncertainty then outline a position that seems to be saying there's a greater certainty you make more money than you do not and so should act toward that greater certainty. Silliness.
If you want to make a poker analogy you would have to consider what you have on the table and therefore stand to lose, your fatigue, how well you've run and therefore what position in a standard bell curve you are at the moment, and 1000 other factors.


There's literally no truth to that statement, I'm sorry, I hate to have to say it so bluntly but it's just not true. They can take whatever you give back and walk away. They can win against all odds and keep doing so. If there were 100 of you at 10 tables each then maybe the laws of big numbers would work in your favor, but at a regular poker table I'm sorry it's just not true.


OK, this is a much better analogy for the point you're trying to make. Yes, the casino assigns everyone who walks in a value in 'loss per hour' depending on their habits and games of choice and bankroll. Unfortunately, as I think you know, it's basically impossible to assign an expected value to an investment in bitcoin at any given present time.
**The certainty of a gain is absolutely and unequivocally superior to the potential for a loss.** How much risk tolerance and loss tolerance you have is up to you. But the goal is to win. OP's risk tolerance seems fair and loss tolerance seems high. He says as much, that he has a good job and therefore plenty of risk capital and a low risk of ruin. Makes sense. Nevertheless if bitcoin suffered catastrophic failure to morrow he stands to lose more than if it continues on its current trajectory... remember, he doesn't really need more money?
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:36:04
I see. So you're saying that keeping your money in bitcoin is gambling.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:53:54
There's no similarity to the two situations. The first is a bait and switch intended to steal value from one currency and funnel it to another. That's intending harm to an entire community. The second is one person selling, and the other buying, exactly what they're trying to. Someone has to be right and someone wrong.
And if I sold BTC at 8100 the person who bought it expects the value to rise or to use it for some other reason. You'd fault someone for selling something someone wants to them? That's a serious reach in comparison.
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:41:49
You know, you've convinced me. You're right. I'm reversing position. It's better to potentially lose money than to definitely gain money. Oh wait, no, sorry, I'm not a retard.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:56:42


That's not a sticking point of mine but if you want to interpret it that way, fine.


Thank you for trying to explain pot odds to me, a professional poker player (-_-) *smfh*


Um... no. Now you give an example of a game with no element of skill and which one player has a 15% expected value per iteration. This is entirely and completely unrelated to choosing to sit in or stand up from a game of poker. There is no situation in which a poker player can accurately state the EV of remaining at the table to be +X%. Before you try to debate that, count the number of 'ifs' in your potential response and then reconsider responding.
You seem to have some rather silly concepts in your head.


Yeah, sure, or they can give it right up to them. Frankly I don't think you understand what skills are even involved in poker. And, yes, Phil Ivey is my idea of a good player. He's an excellent poker player. And he would almost certainly lose at any lower stakes game because he's far too high level, thinking on different terms than other players. It's not chess or snooker or bowling or marksmanship or etc., etc.. Being a much higher level player than your opponents is actually just as costly as being a level below them. You, frankly, just do not understand poker.


Oh, no, I understand what you're trying to say and I've explained already you're wrong. If you need me to make it clearer just ask and I'll go get some crayons and a singing dinosaur.


Right, you repeat yourself. Nobody is debating that when there's slight uncertainty but a statistically great upside that it's better to stay because of positive expected value. Determining expected value is what you seem to have some issue with so I suggest you go ahead and try to figure that out. Ta.

Honestly, this seems like the world's greatest troll. $61 million? The trash in that site is worth a lot of money. Norway and China both buy trash. The guy could take a bank loan, hire workers to sift through all the trash and separate it and sell it all to china and give a $1 million bonus to whoever finds the drive providing the tape is still intact enough to recover the private key. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but even I can see that's a path to profit within not too long a time. He could even offer bonuses to any businesses that would work with him to ensure his solvency.
Saying "I lost the bitcoin" seems to me just to be a big old tax dodge.
Edit: Guys, the loan wouldn't be to find the drive it would be to start a trash recycling business. It's very lucrative to sell garbage to China, The Netherlands and other countries as well. Believe it or not it all has value. A lot of these landfills do it already.

The crazy thing is that, truly, price doesn't matter for a medium of exchange. The price should be determined by what it can buy. It should basically be the average of all the items for sale in the market as related to the number of coins available and the daily transaction need. that way people could use it to buy their stuff they so desperately want to buy with BCH instead of cash for some dumb reason. Naturally that means the price would necessarily fall as it gained adoption but nobody wants to talk about THAT...

Why should transferring them be required for arbitrage...?
If you have a futures contract to buy 1 s2x for 10% of one btc on Jan 1 2019 and you sell one contract to for 1 s2x for 20% of one btc on Jan 1 2019 then you've already made 10%.
Contract 1 is exercised and you must buy the s2x token for 10% of btc at that date. Contract 2 is exercised and the buyer of that contract must purchase from you 1 s2x at 20% of the value of one btc at the same time... it doesn't matter what exchange holds what tokens as long as everyone honors the contracts and the difference in valuations of btc between the exchanges is smaller than the spread you made on the futures.

Actually, no, fuck it - create 100 new coins. Bitclone Clash, Botcoon Crush, Bitc01n Cache, etc., etc., etc. It's a tactic used by the Coca Cola company to make it look like there is competition. It creates the illusion of a crowded marketplace of competitors that are meant to - and do - typically fail miserably and at the same time raise awareness of and demand for Coca Cola itself.

No, sir. To put it simply they're going to sell all the b-cash the wallets received. Whatever the balance of bitcoin on that exchange, that's the amount of b-cash that will be dumped as a giant sell wall into the b-cash ecosystem. This will probably devalue it to a good degree, or so I think. It may also marginally raise the bitcoin price but if it does I think it will happen only temporarily. Since they're committing to buying BTC smart people might want to load up a bit now as it'll get that pump and you can sell to them.
This may create a buying opportunity. Of course it will also further fuck the poor bastards who bought Ver and company's dump. Fucking sad state of affairs.

that is one way of looking at it, yes. You've eliminated the original downside risk. Some people would say that risking what you've gained is still risk - and I am among them - but at the very worst you haven't posted a net loss for that one trade. Another method is cashing out, as a dividend, what you consider a worthwhile hourly rate. If you do so monthly or weekly and the fund continues performing then you're basically paying yourself, slowly eliminating original risk but at the cost of compounding gains.

So your definition of gambling is that there is a non-zero chance of a negative outcome, risk of ruin or "something happening"? Because if it's the latter then literally everything is gambling. And if it's the former then literally everything is gambling. And if it's the median then literally everything is gambling. 
So are you saying that literally everything, in your mind, is gambling? Because I have to say you might have a rather infinitesimal risk tolerance.

It's not a matter of better or worse, right now it's all speculation. IMHO ETH is superior in some not insignificant ways. BlockV has some pretty rad applications. Bitcoin is simply the most established, biggest name. It's the Coca Cola of the crypto world.
Did you know people actually prefer Pepsi in blind taste tests? It's true. Even though 99% of people who claim to be able to tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi *actually cannot.* And to make it weirder *still* even people who *proclaim to prefer Pepsi* actually report it *tastes better* when they drink it out of a *Coca Cola can!*
Bitcoin: It doesn't matter if it's better. Because it's Coke.

You're completely right but that's not really what concerns me. There are going to be a lot of people who get seriously burned on s2x. Those people will be lost to crypto like the great depression survivors who will never deposit in a bank again. There are going to be a lot of older people, too, who will be confused about the whole thing and put off adopting bitcoin thus keeping a huge portion of the economy out of crypto. They already listen to people who say it might be a scam, etc.

Really doesn't matter unless you plan on trading and trading and trading. If you're going to hold long term, buy whenever you have the money to risk. Bitcoin is in its infancy and at a crossroads. IMHO the safest bet is to buy after whatever happens after the fork settles.

It's worth keeping up with the law but this won't "criminalize bitcoiners". That doesn't even make any sense. You think they're going to criminalize themselves? Banks? Exchanges? Give me a break.
The idea is to stop money from moving unchecked through borders... but, seriously, unless you're holding a hardware wallet how does that apply to bitcoin *at all*? 
All bitcoins exist everywhere there is a single node at all times. If you buy a bitcoin in Zimbabwe it exists everywhere the network exists. It's not moving anywhere, just changing ownership. You might as well claim smuggling of sunlight or air pressure. It's makes 0 sense.
Now, I can see lawmakers / lawyers arguing that moving a hardware wallet would qualify as carrying funds because it's sort of exclusive. But, seriously, if I thought there'd be some problem passing a border because I had a record of my bitcoins on me I'd just delete the record / wallet and reboot it later from the seed. Saying you're smuggling bitcoins is basically like saying carrying a debit card or checkbook is smuggling cash.

Actually, it does. As a % of overall price every swing has been lower as the market cap has increased.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:40:44
People use bitcoin as a currency now. The more people who buy in the slower and smaller the swings will be the higher the market cap the stabler it gets. Simple basic market history. As that happens more and more people accept it for goods and services and hold it long term as it still grows more rapidly than fiat, is deflationary, and is waaaaay easier to transact than trying to buy things with shares of google. Get it?
Don't fear, don't shill for b-cash, watch as things continue to unfold favorably and enjoy it. Together we all have a say and a future. Now please go learn about currency and economics so you can come up with real and good solutions instead of thinking that bit coin isn't a currency.

To be fair, if you have made profit, the best move *is* to cash out, logically. It's like this situation I had playing poker. I made a few hundred dollars in a piddling little game against a bunch of retirees and old folks and a couple grinders and I ask for a rack for my chips and this little old lady who, bless her, never had a winning day in her life says to me, "You're leaving? But you're up!" and I said, "beats the alternative."
As unlikely as it is and as little as I believe it, it *is* hypothetically possible for bitcoin to crash at any moment. I don't believe that is what will happen but don't fool yourself that just because something is unlikely that it won't happen. Planes hit the WTC, sinkholes open, lightning strikes twice. Protecting your capital is not a bad move.
That said - I'm hodling. I'd rather be on the shuttle if it explodes than watch it from the ground.

So I got tired of him and offered him a wager: If he sends me $7 from a segwit wallet and pays $100 fee and it takes more than 72 hours then I'd give him $200. Otherwise, he pays me the $200. I even offered to use betmoose so he couldn't say he wouldn't trust me to pay. 
Naturally he kept dodging it, couldn't accept because he knows he's full of shit. Then he starts saying "Why would I accept when now it's taking 5 days..." and I'm like, dude, you realize that's like saying, "I won't take your money because it's getting easier to do so?"

Same thing any currency is backed by: The sentiment of the backers, the things that it can and has bought and sold, and especially the other currency it's been bought for. Every time someone buys it they've created a soft floor at that purchase price.
I advised my dad to buy some btc and he thanked me and said he'd consider it. I checked back in with him to see if he'd done it and give him some advice on how to keep his coins safe during the fork. He'd FUDed and decided not to buy (due to the upcoming fork and traditional investors' POV) and told me that it's based only on market psychology and has no inherent value.
So I said it certainly has an inherent value in utility and I gave him a list of other things 'with no inherent value'. Gold, fiat currency, collectible coins, antiquities, baseball cards, etc...

So, here's my plan: **HODL.**
I'm not going to dump S2X immediately. I'm going to watch and see what happens. I believe S2X has some value as an altcoin and there are plenty of people who are staunch believers that it WILL BE BITCOIN and that CORE WILL DIE and etc., etc. I think they're deluded but I think the same thing about religious fanatics and yet they refuse to die. Churches make bank, even ISIS and the Taliban and all those fucks make tons of money still. All it takes is belief and boom: money.
I think S2X has somewhat of a future. As long as it has some kind of value I do believe the price of the coin will be rise in the long run. That is, of course, if it survives. I could be wrong, so I will watch close, and try to surmise the best course. It's entirely possible the worst things people are saying about it (that it's a pump and dump scheme, the developers don't care, etc.) is true. If that's the case then after the split it'll already be too late to dump - the price will be falling before you even get a chance. The people who developed it will have replay protection first and be on exchanges that are letting them buy and sell before the other exchanges' freezeout periods. If it's not a scam, they won't try to have replay protection "because it's bitcoin" and thus they won't be dumping but trying to convert their core coins to 2x coins. Either way, unless there's perfect parity in pricing it's very likely you can make money just holding both.

@_date: 2017-11-06 14:52:23
Why would I want to? Perhaps I wasn't clear.
I'm not saying buy the contract on one exchange and sell the exact same contract on another.
I'm saying buy a contract with a low strike price on one and sell a contract with a higher strike price and the same settlement date on another.
You are now obligated to buy S2X at one price on one exchange and someone else is obligated to sell it to you at that same price. And you're further obligated to sell it at a higher price... that someone else has committed to buying it from you at.
If it's denominated in btc then as long as that means 'price of btc at settlement' then assuming all parties keep their agreements isn't that an arbitrage opportunity?

This is true, but there's another layer.
Consolidation will happen at an industrial / commercial / institutional / state level. That means commodities such as oil, military tech, etc., being transacted in bitcoin. When it has a basis backing by regular joes and those transactions just a little bit will be good for regular purchases. When it's slowly rising and yet still more convenient than cash it'll make a lot more sense to spend it than now when it's zipping up fast.
Imagine if it rises 2, 3% a quarter steadily and predictably. People will prefer to receive it rather than cash, won't be too hesitant to part with it and so on and so forth. But rising even 20, 40% a year? I'd rather just keep it.

MW isn't my source, it's just a tool that does - despite what you say - corroborate my point of view. I want to be clear, I'm not debating with you. That BTC is a currency isn't controversial. I'm just answering your question"s". If you want to say it's not a currency, OK, fine, believe what you like. But the fact that your only argument isn't valid or sound and that you seem dead-set on your position being the only correct point of view says a lot more about it than anything you've written.
The fact is that bitcoin is indeed in circulation as a medium of exchange. Whether or not you think the volume of purchases is small or not is irrelevant. If the USD started skyrocketing in price people might be hesitant to buy their morning coffee with it as well. It might end up behaving more like a commodity as well. And so what? It would stop being a currency? If that's your point of view, so be it, believe what you like.
And, despite what you say, it is a common article for bartering. Look at cryptocurrency exchanges' daily volume for days, weeks, months - people barter constantly.
So, there you go. If you want to say it's not a currency, seriously, I'm fine with that. If you don't want to respect my and others' views that it is a currency OK, whatever.

So, BTC is not being viewed at the moment as a currency. It of course is a currency but it's being viewed by the investing public as a store of value / investment tool / commodity just like precious metals. High volatility appeals to traders but not to serious investors such as 401ks and indexes and ETFs.
They want steady, sustainable growth with not too many surprises.
This is why so far most big companies and platforms have had a hands-off attitude toward BTC. If it had a great and amazing steady track record then they wouldn't care that they don't understand it. But to be both volatile (wildly so, it's penny-stock volatile) *and* completely mysterious? Too much for them to handle.
*And we need their money* to help BTC to grow and grow. 
Incidentally my take on why btc is doing this right now is because the alts jumped thanks to rebuys, people see it, they start trading back to alts fast fast fast (normal post-fork correction) and others see the dip and move money to USD / alts to wait it out, that causes more dippage, blah blah blah. It's a guess. I haven't looked at the order book. I DGAF. I HODL. I have a USD deposit on the way to CB right now but if this dip continues fuck the fees I'll buy more right the fuck away.

That's pretty horrific but I see people around here who don't even buy chicken feed. Their chickens eat insects and scratch and millet and whatever they find themselves. They just fence in the hen yards, make sure they have access to water and the roosters stick around to guard the chickens.
If you can have a well trained dog or two it's a bonus because they can kill foxes and then you have fox meat.
I'm sure people are trying fishing, but have they tried fish fence farming? Like the big stone traps the Native Americans and Native Mexicans used to use? I hate to hear about people starving when there is so much abundance. It's insane. In times of poverty like this with people starving grain silos and storehouses stay full because 'there's not enough money'. It's insane. It's like saying you have enough flour and eggs and sugar to make a cake but not enough tablespoons and drops. Drives me insane.

'Preciate you. I think what needs to be guarded against is unchecked p2p transactions. I mean from the gov't pov. But that's exactly what bitcoin is for. To facilitate transactions not in person with the same level of anonymity and utility as cash money. 
I imagine in the future truly anonymous wallets will be criminalized in some jurisdictions and creating or trying to use them will be policed as effectively as possible and that other jurisdictions will open like San Marino or the Maldives or other tax havens and profit immensely from their liberal view. Seriously making it easier and better to use bitcoin will only be good for governments but controlling power mongers will never be able to see that.

I'm confused. I'm paying very close attention now as you asked me to but I must be missing something because it sounds like you're agreeing with me and contradicting yourself. How is "lost the capacity to cash out for [the original amount]," different from, "selling at that point would result in a loss of fiat"?
I ask because I have the amount of BTC I bought. I spent the fiat - that fiat is gone. It was gone when I spent it. You're right, if I cashed it out at the current market price then it would fetch less fiat currency than if I had done so a few days ago. But if I don't cash it out at the market price then how have I lost any fiat?
Furthermore, I suppose I don't understand why you assume I'd cash it out for the lesser amount anyway. I could sell it for any amount someone would pay. In Zimbabwe, for example, the price is 12,100 American dollars for 1 bitcoin. I could sell it there resulting in quite the gain. Or I could sell a futures contract to someone who believes the price will be $20,000 in two years and thus make quite a profit right now. Or I can sell an options contract and then later buy it back for less, thus also making a profit.
I suppose what I'm saying is I'm just not as enlightened as you on these things and I'd really like an education about how finance and exchange works. Can you please help me?

There are vast hoards of bitcoin value in nuclear resistant bunkers. Billions and billions and billions of dollars. Thinking a few million withdrawn will crash it is ridiculous. Furthermore if it did start dipping then all the people who want in but think it's too expensive would just start buying. BTC may be in a bubble but if it is the pop isn't near happening.
Furthermore, because of how it's perceived now, big serious investors are more and more looking at it and not yet buying in. Just not convinced yet. It seems huge now, sure, but it's in its infancy. And just think about what will happen when all those people who are having more and more trouble smuggling their money to tax havens want a new place to hide it realize crypto is just perfect...

Futures markets affect different underlyings differently. In the case of a very finite, in-demand, predictably supplied asset ... nobody knows. Because it's never existed before. But the theory is that it will stabilize growth. There's no really easy way to short it. There has to be bitcoin available to fill contracts. Yes, the contracts on the CME (and likely other markets) will be cash settled but they still have to be backed by actual coins. Either on an exchange (which I think is a terrible idea) or by the CME itself (which is a less terrible idea). If for some reason the CME was unable to cover its positions then the asset would have to be sacrificed to the crediting parties.
So we've seen lots of volume and rising price. My opinion is that a lot of that has to do with the CME and other market makers and funds acquiring bitcoin to create derivatives or cover derivative positions. The CME is planning on offering 5 BTC contracts and up to 1000 contracts per trader. Given the size of the CME you can imagine how many BTC that means they'll have to be holding.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:29:24
I guess. I'm not wise on the technology but as a rule it's best to avoid any compromising activity. Given the spoofing and lack of replay protection it is my opinion that it is best to keep your btc out of circulation and offline until whatever shitstorm is unleashed subsides. When it's known how to avoid replay, how to safely fork and how the market is reacting to the 2x chain is when it will be relatively safe to reenter the market.
This is of course conjecture. Personally I think the best method is make a paper wallet, transfer everything there now, log off your computer and turn off the television and hide in a cave with your eyes closed and your thumbs in your ears for two or three months.

Well we do need something worth more than the money we have now.

The shareholders of the first company that can mine an asteroid with any valuable element will be the worlds first trillionaires. PLURAL. My spell correct doesn't even recognize that as a word, get it?
Now, it doesn't mean BTC will be the thing to use as currency for that but... why not though? Think about it. If they're bringing back more value than Earth has every seen wouldn't they need a currency that can automatically deflate to cover it? How else could they ever sell it...?

Don't know about that exchange's rules but, hypothetically, yes. Ano options contract is just a binding agreement to transact. We could make one right now over any verifiable media. You could write one on a bar napkin. What makes bitcoin and limited commodities special is that to exercise the option you can't just make new shares of it - each contract is held against actual assets. In other words it would be extremely irresponsible to sell a contract and not hold the coin to cover it. You'd have to buy the coin and if you couldn't you'd be forced to settle in cash *if the contract allows it*. If not a court could still require it but then also consider it to be fraud.

There are a few schools of thought, so you can rest easy in the knowledge that your opinion is as correct as any of them.
The prevailing thought falls into three basic categories:
* Volatility will increase
* Volatility will decrease
* Volatility will be unaffected.
My personal opinion is that volatility will first increase dramatically then decrease slowly. I'm maybe 50/50 on my confidence. The reason I say this is because it's a whole new thing - nobody's seen anything like this before and so all the trading will be based upon complete speculation / preconceived notions and then later upon the history of the trading that's happened. And every new trade creates more history. So people will get an idea of the patterns it takes and trade accordingly and you get sort of a self-fulfilling-prophecy feedback loop. 
Also, since a shit-ton of new money can get into it all the people who don't want to cash in their 401ks but want in on bitcoin - so long as their trading platform supports it - will be able to buy contracts on it. And I'm partly in that boat. I keep putting off asking TDA if they'll let me buy BTC futures because you bet your ass I'll buy one contract. Sadly I really want it physically settled, I want the coins themselves. Fuck cash settlement gimme dem coins.

Certainly anything can crash. An interesting question is, is bitcoin having an effect on the world economy and if so is it making it more or less resilient? The recovery from the 2008/9 crash has been pretty good. My theory is because... we had no choice. If the economy failed it was literally America failing. The world couldn't possibly take it. It would essentially have meant the end of the modern era.
Now we see in crypto a world dollar, essentially. An easy and safe place to store value, quickly and efficiently, and transport it in case of a serious emergency. And even spend it. Will this make a crash of fiat less damaging and more quick to recover? Or less damaging but slower to recover...? People will always need to buy toilet paper and toothpaste after all.

They're not. They hold both. They can profit from any market movement and manipulation through adjusting positions.
Don't ever make the mistake of thinking the people who created and maintain crypto aren't very smart. Anything you or I can think of they have already. It's their job, and they pay much closer attention than you or I.
Think about all you realize and know, then understand they know it already. Then ask yourself, "If I were smarter than me and had tons of cash and great advisers and the best technology what would I do?" Very few people would honestly answer, "Try to make the world a better place," or, "Stick loyally to one cryptocurrency."

Excellent italics.
I'm sorry - you're mistaken and you're also confusing several terms. Being cash settled just means the coins don't change hands. They still have to exist in the hands of the contract writers. Furthermore the fact that contracts will be cash settled makes it *harder* for market makers to short it. Seeking Alpha has some good articles on the subject.

In the words of Doyle Brunson, it's 100% skill and 100% luck.


Sure, but you haven't described them.


Phil Ivey is a degenerate gambler and his image is wildly inflated. He's nowhere near as skilled as fanboys would make him out to be *and I've beaten players who have beaten him.* But, imagine he was the best in the world and never made wrong decisions - the fact that he hasn't been at every single final table since he started playing tournaments proves my point completely.


Like you falsely said, yes. You're still wrong. The fact that other players who you'd probably call inferior have been paid by him is enough proof of that.


The +EV decision is a combination of many decisions, one of them being knowing that leaving with profit and banking it then coming back with less is the safest and best move. That's why it's against the rules to take chips off the table and keep playing or to leave and cash out and come back with less before a pre-agreed upon length of time. If you knew anything about poker you'd know that.


Yes, and this perfectly sums up the flaw in your thesis in one tidy sentence.


Wrong - it's not hard. It's *impossible* and therefore *necessarily -EV* if you're in the black. That's quite simple logic.


I suppose I'll have to be more clear: The certainty of a win is superior in every way to the possibility of a total loss and the possibility of an infinite gain when the likelihood of either is a equally unknown or impossible to quantify.

Increasing or decreasing the amount of currency is not relevant nor would it be an answer. But bitcoin is infinitely frangible. In other words, if the entire world economy were in bitcoin then bitcoin would be worth about $107 trillion dollars. $4761904.76 per bitcoin. About 0.047 cents per Satoshi. Want to buy something worth 1 penny? Make a transaction for 1/5th of a Satoshi. Change is already made in millisatoshi. Get it? You can keep dividing it down infinitely.


Actually it only represents a fraction of what can be traded specifically with that currency and only that much to someone who can do that trading. For example SA money is worthless to me despite being valuable to citizens of SA because I cannot travel there as I've been to Israel and prefer to keep my head attached to my neck.


No, that's exactly wrong...


... and that's why. Even though it's not a complete accurate truth, you do seem to understand the fundamentals.


Right, if that currency is totally honest and transparent. And that's why having a completely frangible token is a good thing. Sort of like if you could go to a store and spend 1/100,000th of a penny.

What's easier than a coin base app? Think or swim - where people have their 401ks they don't want to cash out for tax purposes and will then be able to buy and sell futures from. Their bank platoforms, calling their broker, buying in to a managed fund. ..
Why won't your scenario happen? It will. Thankfully in order to sell contracts on bit coin you have to hold the coin! That's why they can't do too much selling and riding the short. Besides that the whole point of the exchange is to make money on the spread not to hold the contracts. They want others to hold the contracts.
Don't freak. It's going to be better than fine.

He dumps it all to BTC. BCH goes down, BTC goes up. During this period he is aquiring cheap BCH.
When that sell wall is done and BTC is at another ATH and vulnerable to a resistance bounce he performs another "E"DA and sells again as the BCH price rises.
He can keep doing this as long as people keep falling for it and as long at BTC and BCH is unregulated. Hopefully his next attempt will happen after the CME futures are launched and it inspires some purchasers to insist on an SEC investigation.
However, if he thinks he's very clever and that we are not, he will buy BTC at the same time trying to out level everyone and buy the sell volume on BTC.

That's my opinion. Right now people are really hoping it manages to hit $5,500."

My prediction is that at first it's very much going to inflate the price. Remember that the only way to buy is for someone else to sell - they can't print more coin like they can print more shares of a stock. If someone wants to buy a futures contract then someone else, holding bitcoin, has to agree to sell it. If you think this is a recipe for stability please think again.
The market is bullish? People want to buy futures. The CME already said they're going to limit the margins. The figure I kept hearing was 20%. Would you sell btc at 20% upside in three months when it's been climbing like a chimpanzee on cocaine? I know I wouldn't. Meanwhile selling 20% down to hedge against a bigger loss when historically it's been swinging worse than that then recovering better is also a shit bet.
The bets I've been considering have been selling enough contracts to receive a 100% margin and then use the profit to buy a single bitcoin. Bit of a wild bet, sure, but what can I say? I believe in the future.

My opinion that you're being fooled is based on the fact that it's basing its valuation on supposedly superior ability and tech ... but it doesn't have those things.
It's recent price rise was based on an attack, which is unsustainable.
It's founders and controllers are selling decentralization while maintaining actual control over the algorithm... that's simply falsehood in practice. Get it?
I'm not worried about b-cash being 'superior' or 'inferior' I'm worried about potential investors being misled or seeing the infighting as dangerous and staying out and thus fucking over all of the market. I know a comp sci major will have trouble seeing this but better tech doesn't always, or even usually, win.
Look at coal. Look at electric cars - only now gaining ANY traction after a hundred years or more of availability. Look at DVD vs. Laserdisc. Light and fluffy ice cream vs. true ice cream. Turbine vs internal combustion. Carbon fiber vs fiberglass... the list could go on forever. I do think B-cash is inferior in many ways, but it doesn't matter. It could be infinitely superior and *it wouldn't matter.* Which technology wins is a matter of trust and adoption. Why should, or would, people trust a financial instrument that is literally just an attack? If the alt-right were a crypto, it'd be b-cash. Antagonistic, small, loud, and convinced of its own superiority.


That's the difference between bitcoin cash and bitcoin. Bitcoin has no goals. Its adopters may, sure. But it's just a commodity and currency. B-cash *does* have goals - to supplant bitcoin and steal value from the crypto economy.
As for b-cash being an upgrade, no, it's a downgrade.

Save: to hide away irrelevant of future valuation. Really, it just means 'to keep safe'. This is what most people do with money - save or spend.
Speculate: To take a chance, make a bet, usually with limited information or a greater chance of failure than would be meant by the term invest. For example throwing a six sided die and betting the outcome would be 5 or 6 but with those two numbers paying off greatly would be speculating. Investing in a shipload of grain over a stormy sea would be speculating (that the ship would arrive, that the grain would not be ruined, that the price would not fall and you'd be stuck with what you paid for it before it left...).
Investing: To quote the great and revered Warren Buffet, investing is buying a piece of something you would want to own even if the stock price went to 0. To me the best way to explain it is that the risk is small and the outcome not perfectly assured but given the history and likelihood of outcomes a positive expectation is mathematically or logically merited. For example planting a tree in the proper climate and taking care of it should result in a growing tree. However that's speculative because it's one seed. Planting 100 should result in a specific and predictable success rate - that's investment. Sure there's still the chance of extreme events or unlikely outcomes - nobody ever says investing is a sure thing. If it was there wouldn't be any payout.
Income can be taken from any of the three.

The idea is that futures give an insight into market sentiment. This much is true. But it's a feedback loop. The entire point of a futures market was to ensure a specific price for commodity owners and buyers and a bit of a commission for middle men. As in, the farmer needs $x for his wheat but the baker can only pay $y to the grocer so the grocer buys at $z an everyone knows they'll make money.
The thing about bitcoin is that what attracts people is big gains. It's historically volatile. And, knowing futures traders, the people who'll be attracted to this particular asset class will be wild and crazy fucks looking to make da big bucks.
Expect the alts to feel the wrath as well. My opinion is that bitcoin is going to pump like a motherfucker then people trying to make their money back or hedge their bets will start trying to trade into alts now that they 'understand cryptocurrency.' 
This will continue until the stupid money thins out. How long that takes is anyone's guess.

Not to burst anyone's billowing erection over this, but it's totally unenforceable. Want a free meal? Go to this place and don't bring any cards or crypto. They don't want your cash? Fine - it's legal tender. If they refuse to accept it as payment they're simply forfeiting their right to be paid. They can claim the debt still exists - and likely be awarded the price of the meal, and just as likely not, if they complain - but unless they can prove they have reasonable suspicion the bills you try to pay with are invalid (counterfeit, damaged beyond acceptance by a bank or recognition by anti-counterfeit devices, stolen) then if they call the cops they'll just be told they have to accept the money or forfeit the debt.
That's what legal tender is. You don't get to operate a business protected by the laws of a nation and then not accept their currency.
Frankly if you want to be a total asshole you can pay all in pennies. They don't have to serve you, but once they do and you owe them money, your cash is as good as gold dust.

Not crazy, stupid. If you really think the price is going to fall super low and you believe in the tech then why not sell to buy at a discount? Just makes sense. Convert to dollars that you can buy lots more btc with than less btc with..

@_date: 2018-03-26 01:37:21
Yes I am sure. That's why you can dump a giant bucket of pennies to pay a fine and they have to take it.
In your scenario the aggrieved party's recourse would be to sue for what they are owed, in this case the value of a 2011 Toyota Corolla. If there's a valid agreement - and writing is better than recording, but w/e - the judge can find for the plaintiff and then collection can be effected if the Sheriff (usually the official collector for the court) deems it worth their time or the judge issues an order for immediate collection. The Sheriff shows up at the debtor's place and says give up a 2011 Corolla and the debtor says no, but I'll give the value of the Corolla in cash. Unless that one specific Corolla was already the property of the creditor that's a valid way to settle the debt and has to be accepted. The creditor doesn't have the choice and if they complained to a judge the judge would throw them out of court. 
Furthermore in the same situation imagine the Corolla owner intended to deliver the car but for some reason never was able to and it burst into flames. Meanwhile the other car has already been resold or got wrecked some other way. Bam - debt still owed, no way to repossess the other car as a refund to the seller, the seller can't demand a new Corolla, he'll get the cash value equivalent. *This is why money even exists in the first place.*

I might have been unclear. I can exchange between cryptos now. The benefit of Venezuela accepting any crypto as legal tender is that you can use it to buy things from Venezuela or Venezuelans. Which is great *if you're a Venezuela local.* I'm not. So say I have 100 dollars of garlicoin I wanted to buy something with - what would I be better off buying from Venezuela than converting it to another crypto and cashing it out for example? I suppose this arrangement is useful for oil traders and importers but for most of us, not so much.

None of that is really all that indicative of anything other than lesser mania. Our previous bull market was *not ever sustainable.* That was an insane run which may never be replicated, or it may be multiplied, or there could be a smaller one - but don't *expect* anything like it.
Bitcoin is popular in places where people feel turbulence. The USA, no matter how bad things get, always *feels and seems* stable. Our President defends pedophiles and commits treason and we focus on basketball. Our two greatest military potential opponents develop new weapons technology and take territory and murder political adversaries and we whine about snow and cholesterol. Banks steal our entire economy and we say, hey, cool, look - a new payment app.
Seriously, we look out for  period, and compete with everything else. In Europe, Africa, Asia where you can have a legitimate need to transfer between currencies frequently or deal with economies that have violent swings and can't get everything you need for your businesses from one nation then crypto makes perfect sense to you. In America we can drive in one direction for days and days and days and still find anything we need or want and pay for it with greenbacks and use our one card on anything and have it delivered and etc., etc.
What crypto needs is USA adoption. For that to happen we need one of two things: Something with great demand that can only be bought with crypto, or something with great demand that gives a huge crypto discount. Like if Tesla said, "The new model 4 is only available for Bitcoin until nobody is ordering them with Bitcoin anymore," or, "The model 3 now costs 25% less if you pay with Bitcoin." That happens, BTC to the moon.

I wouldn't say it's convenient at all, it takes quite a lot to do it. Effective? Oh yeah. Absolutely. But the reason it'd be effective is because it's not hard to believe that someone who would create an underground marketplace that allows the sale of harmful chemicals, stolen goods, identity theft, hacker tools and basically anything else at all would shy away from contract murder if he's threatened. And the reason it doesn't seem unlikely is because it's not. He may have started with high-minded ideals but in the end he ran a drug and theft empire. His life and liberty was in constant jeopardy. That can really change a guy. The money may have started as secondary but when you get millions upon millions of dollars, hey, it starts to seem necessary.
I don't think you're a conspiracy nut unless you're basically sure it's true that there was a conspiracy and that nothing could convince you otherwise. To say it's possible they entrapped him or that the whole thing was made up? Yeah, it's possible. But ask yourself which is the simpler truth: That the government framed a kingpin for conspiracy to commit murder or that a kingpin conspired to commit murder?

No need to PM. No need for escrow. That's what multisig wallets are for. And, frankly, there is no need for us to make the wager between ourselves. What I've described to you is called[ high-low binary options trading]( and it's an incredible rip off meant to fleece people like you, who disagree with my original statement, by brokers who agree it.
I highly suggest you read that entire link and learn something. Then read up on high probability trading which will explain the other part of my original statement and how to capitalize: That the size of a likely move is somewhat reliably predictable. Understanding that can help you predict ranges and make effective day and swing trade strategies.
Are there predictable trends? Sort of. If you want to call the movement of the entire economy over 400 years slowly lifting the stock market since the inception of the Dutch stock exchange a trend, sure. As a whole the market has been lifting on an approximately 11 year cycle approximately 40 times. Statistically that's not a very good sample size, but it is the best we have and the underlying factors seem to suggest it will continue.

@_date: 2018-02-27 14:55:21
OK I want to be clear on your specifications. 
You're going to lock yourself into a fixed wager that: For a given randomly chosen 10 stocks that every day, for ten days:
1. If the previous day's (Day 0) closing price was higher than that day's (Day 0) opening price that the same will be true for the current day (Day 1, being the day following Day 0).
2. Same as above, only replace 'higher' with 'lower.'
3. This will continue for ten days with day 1 becoming day 0 every day.
For every day your prediction proves incorrect you will pay me $5 and for every day your prediction proves correct I will pay you $4.90. 
If that's entirely accurate, I need a better premium. For shorter time periods - as in, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours - the premium can be smaller. Other than that, I am completely in agreement with you.
We can make the bet for a set amount of time or net gain for one party with a 'whichever comes first' clause. It'll have to be a pretty small amount since we don't know each other from Adam but we can absolutely pretend it's for a larger amount.
Alternatively you can just play binary options and record it and I'll wager on betmoose.com that you come out behind. You simply have to agree to the stipulation of a minimum number of bets per time period.

The best time(s) to speak to people about bitcoin are:
1. When they ask
2. When they spread bs
You don't have to be an advocate. Maybe Bitcoin won't change the world. Maybe it won't fix anything. Maybe it WILL crash and burn. I personally think Bitcoin is the future, but I've been wrong before. But just present the facts and, if they ask, your opinion. Be humble and honest and above all else, factual. Let them make up their own mind as to if it'll be the future or if the best days are behind us.
I made a deal with my cousin, who was urging me to sell at 17k (and then of course at 19k): Neither of us will say "I told you so."

It is positive. People not being conned into losing money in scams is *very good* for people and for legitimate projects. We don't need, or want, con artists and shitheads giving crypto a bad name or lending legitimacy to the concept that it's all a Ponzi scheme. Money that comes into Bitcoin because of ads for ICOs and crazy lending schemes and bitcoonnneeeect is not only weak hands that are shit for the price of Bitcoin but also people who will be hurt by scams and then go forward and poison Bitcoin's name. 
Short term, is it bad for the price of Bitcoin? Doesn't seem so bad considering how small a dip it's caused. Not great obviously. Some people got nervous. Long term? It's one piece of news in a universe of news. Legitimizing the crypto space *is a good thing.*

Every casino I've ever been to prefers you to buy chips at the cage and may allow it at the table. I was a professional poker player.


Actually it's a camera that's above the counter facing down that goes to a computer. It can see through the bills and recognize them and detect fakes.


They can be as suspicious as they like - you can do what you want with your casino chips. As for security questioning you, that's just not true. I've spent more time in casinos than most casino employees and there isn't one in the world that would harass customers that way. Excellent way to keep people from coming into the building at all. But if you're worried about it, take the chips, put them in your pocket, walk around for five minutes, cash them out. Or just hold on to them - they're as good as cash.
And I have had people pay me for things in casino chips in full view of the cage. One guy owed me about $1,000 and wanted to give me cash. You kidding? We went to the cage, he bought red chips, I exchanged the two racks for one orange chip and put it in my pocket. Nobody said anything except "Thank you."
Another time a guy came to the poker table with a giant roll of $2 bills and I was super excited because I'm a nerd and I wanted them. So when he bought his chips I got my chips together and had the runner bring me his $2 bills *after she ran them under the camera.*
I don't know what world you people live in where people are so suspicious and uncooperative. Casinos do not pry into their customers' monetary privacy. SUPER bad for business. Next you'll start saying they withhold taxes when you cash out.
Casino security is there to keep the casino from losing money, not to annoy customers.


I've literally cashed in and out tens of thousands of dollars within minutes with nobody saying a word. It's just routine to them.

In that case it's too old to survive.
As a technology it might be somewhat mature but that's not important to the price. What is is market movement, public perception, etc. 
There's still no derivatives. Coming very soon - that's going to cause serious, serious volatility in my opinion. No oversight - also coming - no banking (decentralized or otherwise) etc. Still no mainstream adoption. People calling it a scam.
Look at its status. It wasn't even in the public eye until a couple of years ago. People still don't understand it *or* its movements. People don't realize its social importance, it's technological innovation or how incredibly useful it is and even more useful it will be.
Frankly, if they did, ETH would be trading at like 10 times its current value (or 100,000,000 times or whatever - it truly is a very useful technology). 
I'm rambling but my point is that it's only existed for a decade and most of the people who even have heard of it just hold or trade it for money and don't understand it.

Greed is a disease, not an end. It's a motivator. The profit motive, which in conjunction with gatekeepers is the ruin of capitalist societies, can corrupt even the most sincere and egalitarian people. When people see that they have the ability to capture wealth it is very difficult to resist. Only the strongest can do so. The Salks, the Cincinnatus, they are one in a billion. 
It's simple economics that almost all people will act in accordance with their incentives in an inherently selfish way. Even among family. Even among friends. That's one of the most basic rules of economics.
But, for the life of me, I cannot imagine what these people can really stand to gain from s2x. I really can't. If they're worth so much money they have freedom. They don't need to have control over bitcoin. The only thing that will give them is the need to interact with government bureaus and corporate finance departments and *my god is that the most disincentivising thing ever.*
Perhaps it is power that they're seeking. Perhaps they want to be World International Reserve Bank 1 or something. The only way that happens is if Fidelity and Goldman Sachs take the full plunge *and then support s2x.* If that happens it is entirely possible for it to appear completely legitimate and gain legitimacy and be bought by just an enormous amount of retail investors.
THAT would be a **real** bubble. That **would** be able to destroy bitcoin. But all that costs insane money - would banks be willing to lose that much?

@_date: 2017-10-08 14:34:43


I don't think so.


It's a biiiit more nuanced than that. Just think about bankroll management. The basic point is that if you're averaging down to cut a loss you're thinking rather poorly. If you're buying more at dips because you think you're getting a great deal you're thinking wisely. One is throwing good money after bad, the other is buying value. And there's the paradox. If you think it'll rise again in the long term even above the current value then there's no need to 'average down' but buying at a discount is a good idea.
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:07:44
The primary purpose of studying economics is *to not be hornswoggled by economists.* I do have some formal economics education (enough during my degree study to qualify for an associates in economics and be on the way to a bachelors) but the truth is that economics is far more art than science. Economists will never admit that to you - as economists all think they're very smart, and also rely upon the seeming scientific laws of economics to retain work - but the primary useful function of economists is investigation.
A good analogy would be to consider an economy an organism. It's alive, it's functioning (or malfunctioning) and moving value and wealth here and there using the systems in place within it by the cells of that system. Think of an economy as one creature, organizations that create value as organs, organizations that serve to distribute value as other organs, systems that transfer things as organ systems and people that require value as cells. In this analogy an economist is not so much a surgeon or doctor or lawmaker as they are a post-mortem crime scene investigator. 
Yeah, they try to predict how people will behave and do experiments to influence activities and there are some simple successes but never forget that an economy and "THE" economy is made up of people who live within it who are studying it every single day just like the economist is. They're adapting to market forces, trying to create their own, constantly looking to change things to their advantage or keep things to their advantage or TAKE advantage, etc., in the game of maximum reward for minimum effort aka value.
So while you and I might say, oh, put Coca Cola on sale and charge more for Pepsi an economist is more interested in exactly what % of a sale price on Coke is necessary before people purchase Coke at a greater % speed than the discount and if flooding the shelves with Coke bottles would increase or decrease that effect, etc.
For example there was a power company many decades ago that built a power plant. This is a true story. They had tons of dirt left over from digging a foundation. Good, rich soil and loam for planting. Put an ad in the paper - FREE SOIL. Nobody came. Someone had the idea to charge for it. $5 A BAG SOIL was the next ad. All the soil was bought and gone in a weekend. Now an economist (and common sense) would tell you that if you need soil then free soil is better than $5 soil wouldn't they? Well, sure, but in retrospect the perception of value was more important. People simply preferred to pay for it. 
Anyway I'm rambling. My point is that economists don't give anything credibility. They're just people who try to investigate things more. If you're interested in human economic and market behavior, have half a brain and will think logically, scientifically and without bias then you're an economist.

Actually, you said if exchanges sell it for fiat. And yes, it CAN. But it WON'T. It WILL only gain value if btc supporters exchange BTC for it. It's trying to replace BTC. It's one or the other, not both. Why would anyone not familiar with crypto buy s2x and not BTC when all they know is BTC? Oh, you said, because exchanges may list it as Bitcoin. Well, those exchanges will be in the minority. I hope this isn't too hard for you to understand.


If coulds and cans were mayos and hams we'd all have a nice big sandwich.


You think that would *boost* value? That would *devalue* one or, more likely, both.

@_date: 2017-10-15 12:10:54
It's not just whales taking profits, it's normal market behavior. People pick the time they think they'll see a peak / think a dip is imminent and sell. Or they want to use some of their new money to buy something or bills come due or any of the thousand other reasons to take money off the table. Those reasons multiply whenever there is high volatility and *positive volatility is still volatility.*
One of the basic rules of tradable assets is that volatility creates more volatility until it peaks and everything seeks a normal distribution about the mean. Yes, these rules can be bent or broken. This is called a new trend.
Funnily enough, if you have the guts, you can see how this means that a big dip is likewise a good sign. If you can hold strong it means that you can profit later.

I don't know why anyone would be surprised by this. The thing is that the government is a business - besides being interested in security they have to look at things from a return on expenditure point of view. I doubt they're all that interested in guys like you or me, but it wouldn't exactly be in the best interests of any government not to be able to tell who is buying what from whom in terms of weapons, massive amounts of commodities (like the 3000 tons of wheat Russia sold to a Turkish firm) etc. It'd be negligence if they weren't trying to keep a close eye.

I agree it's a loophole that'd probably be easily defeated but monetary value and money are two different things. I just despise the government dipping in to things they don't have any hand in protecting. Sales tax, income tax - that's understandable. But gambling and crypto? They don't do a damn thing to help you make that money or protect it they shouldn't ask for anything. Or, should I say, demand.

Well, OK. So, 1, money laundering means to disguise the origin of money so as to make it appear legitimately earned. I think that's what you meant by your definition. Nobody in what I described is disguising anything. Nobody is claiming anything was won. Nobody is making any claims at all or doing anything even slightly illegal or shady. Everything's done right in the open. It's simply not money laundering even in the slightest.
If you later claim that the chips were won instead of traded for in order to avoid some kind of bitcoin tax then that would be tax evasion, not money laundering. Which would be silly *anyway* because in the USA gambling proceeds are taxable. 
Genuinely: It's not money laundering. But, please, don't take my word for it just go ask a cop or a lawyer or whatever on Quora.

It's like drug companies being against pot or chiropractors being against back surgery. I guess the best way to put it is this:
Once upon a time there was a wise and clever and beautiful but not-too-big dragon who saw all of the villagers sneaking away from the village carrying their gold and their specie and coin to the banks of a river to bury it in the soft clay they would find there, marking their secreted savings to find it later like a squirrel would with its nuts. There it would be safe from the tax man, the thief and the jealous neighbor.
"Mmmm, gold," thought the dragon, and went secretly to steal one or two of the fatter stashes he had watched being buried. And steal them he did. But they were so small they did little to satisfy his greed. Two, then three nights he returned and dug up the little hoards until the villagers, angry at the thieving, blamed the one man in the village who did not use the bank as his store - the rich man with the nice house and gate who could be assured no thief could take his money for his doors were strong and his gate was iron and his safe was too big to move and too thick to break.
Seeing this, the dragon went to the villagers. He told them that he, being a dragon with a cave, could safely hold their wealth with his. Everyone knows dragons are rich in gold and jewels and money of all kinds - if they would leave their money with him then he would happily watch over it where it could not be any safer, and if the villagers needed to travel they wouldn't need to bring their gold with them on the dangerous road they could simply tell the dragon who would fly ahead and deposit their gold anywhere they wanted it along the way so they could afford their travels.
After much discussion the peasants agreed. Even the rich man agreed. And the dragon grew fat and happy. And he gambled with his other dragon friends at the dragon casinos with the peasant's. And when he lost he pretended he didn't - who cared, unless the peasants all came for their money at once they'd never know - and when he won he kept the profit. And when the peasants came to ask for him to move their gold elsewhere he happily agreed. "But, naturally," he said in his smooth and silky voice, "you will have to pay me to do so. You know that flying is not so easy when you're as big as I." 
"But it is on our gold that you have grown so big. Surely you could afford to lose a little weight. Flying will be good for you."
"Piss off."
And he charged for everything. And then he charged more. And more. And eventually the peasants grew angry and threatened to take all their gold back and bring it to the Knights Templar who they'd heard so many good things about from returning crusaders. And this angered the dragon in all his wealth and hubris, the dragon who had forgotten - or never really believed - that the gold was the property of the villagers. And so he said, "Fuck you, I am the only game in town," and went into his cave to do as he pleased. And the villagers stormed the cave, pitchforks and axes and even a guy with a stick on a horse. And when they arrived they found a sign saying, "Out to lunch, eat shit - Dragon." And they also found an armored cavalry brigade in full splendor waiting for them for, you see, the Dragon was quite clever as I'd mentioned and had been lending their money with interest to the royal family.
All seemed lost for the village. The dragon didn't care that the villagers' deposits stopped, that they wanted their money. The entire village could die and he would still have ten other villages' gold pouring in. Twenty more by next year. 40 more after that. And so on. And so the villagers fell to their knees and begged the Knight Commander of the cavalry to please have pity on them and slay the dragon to which the Knight Commander said, "Piss off," and prepared to charge to disburse the crowding rabble. And the villagers did the smart thing: They ran, they ran away back to the village and cried that they could not control their own money. It was a dark night, and cold to boot. The villagers had nowhere to go, nobody to turn to. But luckily, someone turned to them.
As it turned out the events in the village and the surrounding area had not gone unnoticed by the creatures of the forest. All of them, even the really sexy but totally not into you wood nymphs. The really sexy but totally not into you wood nymphs were magical creatures with tight butts and amazing musical skills who made sheep dance and seduced deer and goats for the amusement of their often drunk but somewhat competent friend Wizard The Hermit who had forgotten his own name long ago. Wizard The Hermit, who went by Wiz, didn't hate dragons perse but he had seen the destruction they could wreak if left unchecked. It was the events of a tragic BBQ that had driven him into the forest to begin with and, as you can imagine one who had seen most of his town destroyed by fire and who now communes with goat-humping mystical teenagers, he was usually pretty high on forest mushrooms. And so he seemed mad. Truly, you would not want this guy over for dinner. But he was also quite bright. And like most bright thinkers who are generally stoned and satisfied he had a creative solution.
So Wizzy sent three of his RSBTNIY Nymphs - clothed - to the village in the dead of night with magic scrolls to paste to the doors of the few people in the town who could read. The scrolls said, "Teach everyone how to say this incantation and you will be safe from the ravages of the gold-fat dragons." Well, what did they have to lose? The first villager said the magical words and in his hand appeared a bag of gold coins, each with the mark of a kingdom he didn't recognize. He blinked. Holy cow! It was a hell of a nice day at the village, as you can imagine. It wasn't long before all the villagers were holding their own bags of gold. They all gathered at the church to discuss what had happened. It wasn't long before they heard an angry bellow, the whoosh of wings and saw the sky go orange. 
The dragon had come for "his" gold. The doors of the church crashed open and in stomped a rather smaller looking dragon than they'd known. It looked almost the size it had been when they first voluntarily gave up their gold oh so long ago.
"You withdrew your gold in secret and without paying fees... how DARE you? WHERE IS THE GOLD? I WILL HAVE MY MONEY."
The villagers looked around, confused. They were holding the bags of gold right in their hands and before them on the floor and even some on the altar.
Again, the dragon demanded to know where the gold was hidden. The villagers looked around at each other. It stalked up the aisle, overturning the pews. And wherever its feet landed, if there was even a sliver of one of the new coins in its path, those coins scurried away as if alive - as fast as mercury and as quiet as a cloud doing a kitten impression. Everyone noticed and was amazed, everyone but the dragon that is, but only the town drunk was unafraid and fell over laughing. The villagers, as a one, started to understand. The crazy dragon-hating hobo in the woods with all the sexy bestiophiles and really good mushrooms that all the kids in the village seemed to enjoy had somehow transformed their normal gold into dragon-proof-coins.
Ignoring the dragon, now, the villagers looked one another. They all knew that this new gold was worth ten times regular gold, easily. They had to tell their friends, they had to tell the other villages: GET IN ON THIS! GET IN ON IT RIGHT NOW! And the dragon knew, as well... the dragon could see it in their eyes that they had found some way to deceive him. And so off he flew as fast as he could telling everyone that magical gold that disappeared from dragon's sight didn't exist. It was a myth! Malarky! FAKE NEWS!
And so, thanks to the dragon doing so, all the villages he visited requested the magical incantation.

Freedom. Please. We imprison more people per capita than almost anyone else and make them work for nearly nothing or exactly nothing and *that is no different than slavery god DAMMIT.*

I'd like to know all the regulations so I don't break them, but the real question in my mind is why people don't just make a new wallet with a new private key and sell that instead of actually transferring the bitcoin? It never becomes 'real currency' or gets 'cashed out' or whatever. Shouldn't that be a loophole vs. taxes? Selling a room that contains a lb of gold isn't selling gold, is it?

Genuinely, Senor Hodl, so many people in the normal-sphere are pro-regulation that if s2x wins it very well could cause the moonshot. And, sadly, since humans act according to their perceived incentives that might just crumble the original bitcoin supporters to the s2x cause. As philosophically beautiful as the idea of bitcoin being a government-ending, world-changing, regulation-defying currency is, in the end most of the world just sees governments as impossible to fight and would just give in.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:21:29
Satoshi disappeared because *who invented currency?* What was the name of the first person who made an inter-band agreement that cowry shells would be accepted for food and clothing and shelter? Who determined that a bit of gold with a face on it was worth x days servitude? Who in the ancient world was the person who came up with the idea of selling x fields of corn next year for a note saying just that and a handshake at the previous years' market?
We know the name of the guy who invented bitcoin, and we know his thoughts. But once bitcoin, or crypto in general, is widely adopted even that could disappear. It'd be better that way anyway. I always come back to the thesis of buying a goat for an African from my couch in Europe or America. Think about it. Wouldn't it be better if nobody knew why crypto was accepted for things? I mean, think about gold - anyone will take it for payment for almost anything despite 99% of those people having essentially no use for it at all. If you can send enough money to feed a poor Muslim in Africa and they know it comes from a non-Muslim American *that is a terrorist you have prevented.* If you can send money to India or Canada to buy asthma medicine that's a payoff big pharma doesn't get.
If people knew who Satoshi was, maybe some would disagree with his person and not accept crypto just because of that. Everybody is hated or mistrusted by someone. But, thanks to his anonymity, nobody can say they hate it because of who he was/is.
As for your theory about nabbing - why nab? Why grab up, why frighten? Much easier to just corrupt. If I were the US Gov't and I was going to try to control btc I would absolutely do something like s2x. But who's to say that wasn't part of it from the very start? Prove the concept, get lots of international money involved, then try to take it over? It wouldn't have worked if people thought it was US controlled. In the end we'll never know but I think the most likely explanation is just human greed. Some people got into it for the principles, some for the cash.

There are far too many moving parts in a worldwide economy to put it so simply. In arid lands the price of water rises in tropical it falls but the price of pesticides rises, etc. International trade between nations and individuals will all influence the value of btc  or whatever crypto is dominant when adoption occurs.
Let's say you have a stable economic marker. The price of 1 bottle of water for example. People need a couple of those a day, so they shouldn't cost more than an hours work at most and that's an extreme price. Or the price of something that hasn't changed and won't like a little Caesars pizza pizza deal. If people agree that one Satoshi is worth 1 bottle of water or a quarter of a pizza pizza deal you've got a useful index. Water becomes more scarce suddenly btc becomes more valuable.
It's just got to be pegged to something is what I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:08:25
If they're pumping the price to manipulate it they have no stake in letting it burst. All that's needed is for exchanges to agree on some measure of protection - which will be needed before mass adoption anyway. If they do manage to crash it it'll be because they want to buy a ton before mass adoption, and the price will rise back anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:48:04
You're entitled to disagree. 
Exchanges *will* list s2x for fiat. And buying it with fiat will be as slow as buying it with bitcoin. Bitcoin is nowhere near high adoption and is only now generating institutional and traditional retail attention. The people who will buy crypto for fiat will be doing so based on its price movements. The people who know crypto already - and there are blessed few of us - could much more easily buy s2x with bitcoin. The people who don't simply think of crypto as bitcoin just as xerox means copy and kleenex means tissue and etc. etc. Any exchange that lists s2x as 'bitcoin' or 'btc' or 'xbt' will be in the minority. If people buy one thing expecting it to be bitcoin or a discount bitcoin then they'll just lose confidence when they realize what has happened, or don't, and it doesn't perform as well as they hoped.
In less verbose terms getting money into s2x is the only way to raise its valuation in the eyes of exchanges. Well, that and fraud. And how to get money into s2x? Exchange btc for it. And we'll know if that's happening as the market cap of one falls and the other gains, among other metrics.
So what will happen? Will the founders of s2x buy and buy and buy more to pump the price? How much of an appetite do you suppose they have? If they do - do you suppose that the people buying up btc now in speculation will sell their split coins when s2x price exceeds s2x futures? I mean... that's just free money, isn't it? To let the price of the s2x coins inflate then sell them for btc and put that into cheaper futures?
Simply put there is no efficient way for s2x to gain adoption other than opening their own exchanges or for btc investors and believers to switch. And would you? Seeing how btc does ... would you switch it for anything else?

But averaging down is worse because you buy at a floor, it busts the floor - so you buy at the new floor. And so on and so on until you give up or go broke. Thus you're risking more and more capital. Averaging down is a very easy way to magnify losses.

You're not wrong that people should use their bitcoin. I personally will use it if it's easier to do so than using other options. For example, to buy something from an internet person.

I for one already understood. Regulation isn't the problem, in fact greater regulation is why CAD doesn't suffer like USD. They police their banks. The problem is when the regulation is done by those who would be regulated. Corruption simply becomes the law. For example it was not illegal for a long time for congresspeople to practice insider trading! Amazing, but true. 
To put a little light on your shade, there's plenty of financial regulation in the USA but I could, literally, RIGHT NOW, THIS VERY DAY, open a new corporation have it certified within a week and trade it OTC in another few hours. I could even raise capital BEFORE having it certified.
And the SEC? They wouldn't do a fucking thing. How do I know? Because I buy stocks like that as they're pumped then sell them before they're dumped. It happens constantly, and I mean that literally. I knew a guy who had a butcher. He opened a second location, took it public, named it something fancy sounding like "north essex biotech" and made a boatload. Sold his shares, sold the location, closed the corporation. He wasn't even trying - the name just made people want the stock.

No, I have never sold any bitcoin ever. Only recently purchased my first btc. But I don't think it's money laundering. Bitcoin isn't money, legally speaking, and receiving payment isn't concealing anything from the authorities so I don't see how it could be considered as such.
The guy buying the bitcoins might be doing so for money laundering purposes but I doubt they'd do such under cameras if they were afraid of scrutiny and whether or not they declare their purchase so it can be taxed is of no concern to the seller.

@_date: 2017-10-22 01:58:11
Nah brother. As the upward trend slows - which it must - the fragile quality of bitcoin becomes more useful. Just like gold, which people often use to avoid money changers. Sure fiat will be worthwhile but what if you live in Germany and travel to Austria monthly or weekly and have recurring orders of surrender literature from France and send dentistry tools to England? You want to change your money that often or deal with multiple exchange rates and valuations essentially forcing you into the fore game? Of course not. You spend your 80 Satoshi on your coffee in Austria (this being the distant future when 1 btc is worth a million smakackeroos) and charge the British in btc for the dentist picks and spend the same on the literature from the French. 
Mass adoption, which is currently driven by investment and speculation, will create bitcoin utilitarianism.
That video posted yesterday about the gold coin is really interesting because if I were working at a cafe today and somebody came in with a bag of gold dust and wanted to buy a charcuterie platter and the cafe owner didn't want the gold you bet your bottom it is going in my pocket and that meal is going on my tab. If he just wanted a cup of coffee he could just pinch off a bit. Etc.
In the interim you're absolutely right - and it's good for btc for people to hodl. If you think about it that's how you get to mass adoption. You need millions of people to have it and trust it and talk about it. Once it is seen as truly valuable it will be a widely accepted payment method.
Businesses need to want to hold it and consumers need to want to use it.

Exit... Well, right now Bitcoin defies technical analysis and my personal fundamental analysis is that if it doesn't gain mainstream / retail / institutional investor support it'll stagnate and stagnation may cause a crash.
If it continues to gain more and more governmental legitimacy / regular joe / institutional interest then it'll continue to rise in value. Who doesn't want to be able to take $1,000,000 through an airport in an invisible cloud above their head?
I don't have a lot of BTC but I do plan on buying more. The economic indicators I'd see that would cause a price drop would be after most of the nations of the world adopt bitcoin. Then we'll see a worldwide economy and the value of a single coin could be more accurately assessed. Of course, at that time, so many people will be invested that allowing the price to drop would just be terrible for the world and so must be protected against. It has to be stable and agreeable so that it can allow poor people to easily use it. Again and again I say, I want to buy a cow for an African from my couch. I want to buy a kg of fresh chocolate from a farmer without going through fucking Nestle. Fair trade, eh? Bitcoin can create *better than fair trade.*
Seriously - look at who supports and who opposes bitcoin. That's all you need to know about it.
For: Everyday people, investors of all scales, retailers, poor people, people who live under authoritarian regimes or with unreasonable economic governance thrust upon them.
Against: Big banks and corporations who can only exist through exploitation.
That tells you all you need to know. With the incredible amount of money being poured into bitcoin by tech people, etc., it's very likely the current price level is STILL higher than a post bubble price would be. This skyrocketing is great for getting people interested and invested. Amazing for that. All of us, we are the bank of bitcoin.
So, my exit plan? If it seems the price is plateauing, failing to break resistance and there's no more room for adoption I'll sell the milk and keep the cream in the market.

Hey buddy I'm going to simplify your life. Just go to a casino. Surveillance, money checking and escrow all in one.
Bring your bitcoin transfer method. Meet the guy at the cage. Have him buy chips with the bills. When the cashier takes the bills they're passed through the fastest and most rigorous verification process in the world. If any are fake, you bet it'll be known.

And I suppose that's why there isn't a Chicacoin.


Yup. And? If your imagination is limited to dark money for illegal goods and services I pity you. IMO the best reason to have it is to not be beholden to a bank. A CC is a loan. If you prefer debt you can certainly get all you want.
Then there is of course security. Every time you use a CC or even pass near a CFC device you risk theft of funds or identity. On a long enough timeline it's certain. Not so with crypto.

Depends on bankroll and need for liquidity. There are plenty of periods when over-invested speculators could have easily screwed themselves. And don't forget that BTC is very, very young - to predict its future based on its past now is ridiculous.

@_date: 2017-10-14 03:39:34
Haaaaaa! Did they?
@_date: 2018-07-26 05:37:07
For them to accept BTC they must desire or require it. This really is one time where simple supply and demand is a good enough answer and a simplistic copout. The BTC community is the supply and you want these big box stores to have demand, thus be willing to trade goods for BTC. Why don't they?
First off, they have no reason to change how they receive money now. No matter how superior BTC is as a currency and transfer tech they're still just going to convert it to cash. They're not in the currency speculation business and they operate in local currency. So even if it were near instant it's just another layer.
Secondly they don't need to buy anything in BTC and get no benefit from doing so and *if they did* they could just buy BTC in small amounts to satisfy that requirement as it arose and thus keep from raising the price. Why would they do that? Because if they're transacting in it and  not speculating or investing then having it be lower in price compared to the local currencies on both sides of the trade means they save money. But it's irrelevant because none of their suppliers will demand to be paid in BTC so they don't need any.
Third, they don't need the stigma or legal quagmire they imagine might be attached. Theread are a lot of very traditionally-minded people out there and all the news like "used for drugs, crime and terror" and "child porn on the blockchain" frightens them.
So what you need to do to get these stores to accept BTC is to unionize a majority segment of the producers of a commodity that feeds the suppliers that sell to them. Coffee, chocolate, citrus, cotton, you know - the Cs. Or hell, talc. Or salt. Or what the hell ever, but the key is they have to demand 25% of whatever it is they produce be sold for BTC and after that threshold is reached they'll give a small discount on the however much more is paid for in BTC. In this way the middlemen, suppliers - or just purchasing execs - will need BTC to spend. So they'll get a liquidity provider at a premium or they'll implement it in some stores which COULD be a lot less expensive but not the way they'll do it.
They'll need security tests and propietary apps and special practices or something. And they'll still need an agreement with some kind of liquidity provider because their margins are so thin they just cannot hold on to more BTC than they need for the short term because to them it's far too volatile. A 3 month dip would be 3 months deep in the red that could have been black. That's a quarter. It's a big deal.
They're not thinking about stabilizing BTC. They don't want to deal with it.

They mean backed by a commodity or guarantee. The way to defeat that is by saying the size of the bitcoin economy is X. It can buy Y things in Z countries and N more every day.

I understood it immediately and saw it's huge potential immediately and I figured that, because of that potential, it would be squashed immediately or appropriated by banks or the like. I saw its huge volatility and that it was mainly being used for drugs and such and thought no way any government would let it survive but that the day a government endorsed it it would have intrinsic value.

@_date: 2017-10-17 10:09:43


I'm sorry to contradict you but this is just not true. Put simply, the price of bitcoin is determined by *what people will agree to buy or sell it for.* That's it. It's basically arbitrary. It'll have to find some equilibrium at some point in order to be actually *valuable.* It's true value is simply that it's very very useful as a currency.
If exchanges ceased to exist right now people could still easily buy and sell btc with one another and I predict the price would be a lot more stable, for a time using the last coinbase price as the basis.
But eventually you just need to have a basic agreement on what things should cost. For example a person should earn enough money in a month to pay one month's rent and have 50 - 75% of their wages left over to spend on transportation, essentials, investments and saving. So when people are accepting their wages in bitcoin you can expect to have a general consensus for example that 1 Satoshi is worth a slice of pizza in whatever country has the widest bitcoin adoption.
But the true power of bitcoin is in international exchange. FOREX is a huge pain in the ass, international banking just as bad. If I can buy a goat in Africa for an African without leaving my couch and not feel like I sent gold but that I sent African money, that'd be the right value as well. Get it?
Fundamental to the concept of bitcoin is that it is 'deflationary.' As the supply contracts the price should rise, as long as the idea of its value - bolstered by years of growth - encourages people to hold. As long as that happens, people will keep wanting it and creating more will be harder and harder. 
Sorry for the rant. I should have written an entertaining story instead.

So I went to the floor man, good guy I knew well by then, and asked him just that. And he said he couldn't tell me anything specific and that he had a card that explained everything. I still have that card. It says, and I'm paraphrasing, that according to some sort of policy and laws that at some point they may ask for identification for tax purposes.
It was an explanation card with no explanation. They do not want to bother people, get it? They want people to come in and use their money comfortably. It's good for business.

You're right, but not skeptics. Just regular ol' consumers who see no need for BTC. IMHO LN is pretty great, a fantastic solution for people who already have BTC and want to be able to use it quick. It's also great for vendors who want to serve those people. It does absolutely nothing for anyone else. The real point of BTC isn't to be used super fast as point of sale. The point is to be able to use it for things that would otherwise require permission / exchange / multiple fees / divulging identity. None of that is an issue when you're buying a donut unless you're buying a donut in London and you're from NK and you don't have any brit-bucks or w/e the fuck they use there.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:42:53
This perfectly illustrates why, IMHO, it is best to not have a hardware wallet. My initial reasoning was that since BTC exists everywhere-and-nowhere that if you cross a border your bitcoin isn't moving anywhere. Go through an airport, a dozen airports, a thousand airports and logically you aren't subject to currency import/export rules. Are you bringing any financial instruments anywhere? No. Unless they rewrite the rules to tax anyone who possesses financial instruments just by that person moving then it'll be that way. And when would they do that? They're the rich - they don't want to be taxed like that.
Hypothetically one could say your laptop or phone 'contains' the cryptocurrency but at least they need some reason to look through it and they can't say everyone with a laptop or phone is carrying money.
But they can indeed look at your hardware wallet as proof you're transporting cryptocurrency. They have something concrete and present that a politician who would say the internet is 'a series of tubes' or a 60 year old technologically behind the times judge would hold is carrying currency.
Hardware wallets: not even once.
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:34:58
Hypothetically someone who buys bitcrap crash thinking it's bitcoin, possibly because the same coin can have different tickers on different platforms or possibly because there isn't a coin called bitcoin core. 
Buying bcash instead of bitcoin could very realistically cause real damages. If it was a real attempt to mislead, that's felony fraud. Could be international wire fraud as well. Considering all the paper trails have been laid out like string for any investigator who wants to look, it wouldn't even be difficult to prove what happened. The only question is was the intent malicious or incompetent - but it was absolutely to capture funds meant for another destination, either way.
Real damages? Misleading consumers? Directly benefiting yourself and your partners? 100% felony fraud on a rather grand scale.

It is indeed dire because it shows a basic lack of understanding of economics.
Right now, demand is high. Limiting supply by delay will keep the price rising. Limiting the ability to sell will keep it from falling. In other words - limiting fluctuations. Remember how banks sometimes limit withdrawals to avoid a run?
When it's more stable then scaling it to be faster will make a good deal of sense. Then people will be able to use it like an ATM card at the store. But now? Let's keep the scared money from fleeing and the good money excited.
