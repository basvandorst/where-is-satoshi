I know they didn't pull anything out of thin air (why do you think I think that?). I also know it's not publicly available. Neither of these facts have anything to do the the right to be forgotten. What I am trying to understand is: What constitutes a valid reason to retain data in case of "defence of legal claim"? Obviously financial regulations may be a candidate, but where do we draw the line? I know GDPR is relatively new and there are no real precedents yet, but I still think this is very vague. According to such a legal definition (which is exactly the definition, not just a short version) I figure that almost anything goes, as almost anything can somehow end up being involved in a legal claim. And I find it odd that they do not wish to elaborate on their decision when asked directly. If they did do so I suppose I could have avoided this whole thread.

If this is the case then every company could just take that approach and not bother with any deletion requests because the worst consequence would be... having to delete a user's data?

I am not trying to "fight" (?). I am trying to understand what exactly "defence of legal claims" in this context means and what qualifies as a valid reason to refuse to delete someone's data (and what does not). There's no reason for you to be "done"? I never said you were wrong, I just asked follow up questions. I am perfectly willing to see other sides, which is the reason I was asking the question in the first place - otherwise why bother asking. I suppose I would have gotten a proper explanation from BitPanda if they had taken the time to respond initially, which they didn't, they just refused and cited section 3.e.

So every company can just claim that I was once a customer and hence render the right to be forgotten under the GDPR moot? That doesn't sound right.

Reading a TOS is not explicit consent. That's the point. You **have** to have checkboxes for **each** company (or collection of these explicit companies) you want to share a user's information with. You **cannot** put this into a TOS since it's then not explicit. That's the idea anyway.

Well, what I meant was: "So every company I ever created a user with can just claim...".

Even if such a thing was trivial, which it isn't, that changes nothing. GDPR was written specifically to make loopholes such as those useless, otherwise it would have no effect. US based companies must still comply with the GDPR if they want to do business with European citizens. If they have any presence in the EU (such as an office or headquarters), they can be prosecuted within the EU. We're getting a bit off topic here though.

How is that different from any other company? Everyone has legal obligations and legal risks.
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:50:29
That would mean the GDPR has no real effect on a user's right to be forgotten - something companies like Facebook take **very** seriously. They probably wouldn't if it bore no financial risk for them at all. If violating these rights do not mean you violate the GDPR and become liable, then what's the point of it all? It doesn't really add up to me.

I can understand that for banks and such, where you can't just enter information into a site and become a customer right away, but BitPanda has not explained themselves when I asked them, which was why I am wondering what is acceptable as "defence of legal claims". I have never traded anything on BitPanda, nor do I wish to do so - I just want them to delete my personal information, which I find is a reasonable request given the circumstances.
What do you mean by "you should look into it"? Is that not what I am doing? :)

Wouldn't a case ruled in favour of a user requesting deletion then have consequences for such a company? Such as fines for violating a user's right to be forgotten.

That makes sense. I have trouble seeing how this prevents any other company from claiming the same rights. Let's say I have an app where you can buy shoes (or whatever). A user signs up, then buys some shoes, then asks for his/her account information to be deleted, then claims I took too much money out of their account, sent them the wrong shoes or whatever. Wouldn't this situation create a similar problem? And if yes, then any platform that does virtually anything could potentially claim that they need your data to defend whichever legal claim they can think of.  
Edit: For what it's worth, I don't think that deleting a user account that has never had activity qualifies as "are willing to alter financial data" - also, they are willing to, just not until after 3 years.

Interesting. I was under the impression that GDPR was written specifically so that you could not "Terms and conditions" your way out of it, simply because no regular users read those things, making them practically irrelevant, as you could put anything in them and nobody would notice. Edit: With regard to "can (and will) be avoided using contracts with 3rd parties"
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:15:32
As I understand it such a case would require *explicit* consent from users to share their information with the specific company/3rd party/parties. Not obtaining this consent would make the company collecting the information liable to pay hefty fines.
