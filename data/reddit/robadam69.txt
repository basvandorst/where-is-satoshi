That's a neat site BTW. Thanks for sharing.

Cryptsy Sounds like a better option. I'll have a look at them. Thank you.

I bought bitcoin from coinbase and sent it to a wallet I control. How do I make anonymous bitcoin purchase? Bitcoin Tumblers are too shady and I don't trust them, and blockchain sharedcoin is broken. Are there better options?

Your browser should be the easiest to fingerprint.

Apple has been established long before was created. They also have millions of dollars for marketing.

I think this is a problem with Reddit's voting system and the default "Hot" algorithm. It rewards content that is easily consumable and appeals to the subreddit's most active users (Those who sit on and vote on stuff). These posts will reach the front page immediately and results in more votes and discussion. [This  top post is a good example]( I don't think differs from in that way. The comments also works the same. Short, snarky, pro-bitcoin, anti-government comments will get upvoted by active users and then the bandwagon effect takes place. This may be alleviated by hiding the vote scores for few hours.
Do you think there is a difference between crowd and bitcointalk.org?

Twitter is shit for this kind of discussion. Anyways, here are more tweets

I haven't read this. Do you have a link for the thread?

It has to be provably fair!

What's frustrating is that once this week passes, most people here won't even visit the bitcoin wiki again and will just move on to another target. Luke and few others will still be there to contribute, for free. [He has been editing bitcoin wiki since 2011](

This is probably why they can't pay more than one.

Ok, this guy is insane. He has removed Gavin's post for "trolling"
This page should be deleted until there is a working, supported, maintained Tonal Bitcoin client. Vaporware doesn't belong on this wiki, you'll get articles on CosbyCoin and UnicornCoin... **Gavin Andresen** (talk) 23:28, 25 May 2013 (GMT) 
He also removed **all** the votes for deletion.
Who's the administrator of bitcoin wiki? He should've banned him along time ago for edit-warring.

We'll see when the 2014 report comes out this spring.

Can anyone explain the arguments for and against having 20MB block size?
Also, if a sizable number of miners refused the fork upgrade, does this mean my bitcoin will exist in two separate ledgers and can be accessed with the same private key?

I don't think this a good argument for running a node for free. People should get compensated for keeping the law just like they do when they secure the network. It does take time and money to set up a full node after all.
