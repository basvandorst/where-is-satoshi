My bad, understand where you\`re coming from. Here\`s why I don\`t agree with you 100%. If you attribute the entire value of BTC to the processing power required to maintain the system, there is no output whatsoever. All the processing power is consumed 100% to maintain a system which isn\`t used for usecases outside of itself. A very flawed comparison would be power generation. Imagine that the value of a gigawatt is tied to however much power the powerplant can generate as a whole at any given time, but all the power the powerplant is using is instantly consumed by the powerplant in order to generate that power.

Damn good &amp; interesting point. Historical differences between the usecases intended by creators and usecases championed by people. I actually think that the solution comes from the diversity of tokens itself. It makes sense to have investments, it makes sense to have trades (look at FX), it makes sense to have purchases. I\`m not your everyday capitalist championing consumerism, but there is a direct economical link between open consumption market and wellbeing of the people (look at how closed systems based on barter/no outside trading lead to population decline and havoc: North Korea, Cuba, Congo, Papua New Guinee, Venezuela, Moldova, and the list goes on and on).  Overconsumption is a huge issue, but consumption alone drives a lot of progress.

Would love to see more of it bud. That\`s exactly the point :) we need a gig-economy around crypto, we need crypto-first, global marketplaces, we need a system to help pay taxes in crypto, we need asset &amp; securities tokenized. We need inclusion, in order to drive adoption. And this will not happen as long as we\`re set in our ways (as a community) in how we interact with these tokens, and these concepts.

You know, I tend to agree, there needs to be people/businesses willing to receive and hold BTC on the other end of the value chain as well, that\`s why one of the points I was making was that you should pay suppliers/freelancers with crypto, if you can. At the same time, we also allow merchants to instantly exchange the crypto for fiat, in order lower their perceived risk of accepting it, although in the long run I do agree it\`s not the best way to maintain value.

:) TL;DR, don\`t **just** hodl :)
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:07:16
That\`s a really good point. I\`m just thinking of ways more people could participate, in more ways. Right now we\`re rather limited and not really that inclusive. Not really.

I like the visual. Remember when we did physical coins with addresses on them? That could help the negative you\`re seeing.
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:22:33
Thanks a lot, again, sorry for TL;DR, it\`s my first post to Tumblr ever and I treated it more like an article than a forum, my bad. 
So.... how do we get people to accept crypto and how do we get those that hold/trade to spend a small portion of it?

You\`d be surprised of my opinion of bankers, as a whole. Here comes the disconnect between you and me. When you say "make money out of thin air", I\`m assuming you\`re talking about the BTC-USD/EURO rate, while I\`m looking at the direct report between BTC - Value of Goods/Services. You\`re treating BTC as an asset class, you invest and it appreciates over time. I\`m treating it as decentralized, transparent money, which is what BTC was intended to be.

Instead just Hodl/Exchange(invest), I propose   "Save some, spend some, invest some" thesis. how much in each category depends on everyone\`s particular desires and situation. Make it more inclusive, essentially.

Not really what I was proposing.   "Save some, spend some, invest some" thesis. how much in each category depends on everyone\`s particular desires and situation.  I\`m just saying, treat it like money. Try buying a $12k from another continent with a credit card and you\`ll see it\`s not as simple as it looks.

I agree that US taxation and filling for BTC/Crypto purchases is problematic, I\`m just saying a ballance is needed as this three legged chair of economy needs consumption too.

Can\`t help but agree with all the points you\`ve made, but here\`s where it gets wierd for me: 
there\`s nothing stopping anybody from closing the loop on the economical triangle (spend,save,invest), and yet, nobody really does it. We\`re all looking at other people to spend it first, and not many people actually use it.  
I\`ve regreted spending any bitcoins but I knew that witch each purchase I\`ve made, each transaction I\`ve created, more people got in, the value-chain got bigger. Holding it doesn\`t help anybody in the long-run (really long-run).  If we don\`t use it, the only value on it is subjective, and you need more usecases for more people to want it (in turn increasing the value). All I\`m saying is that money has to move.

Thanks for the feedback, it\`s my first ever post on reddit, will take note. As to your point, I can\`t really agree, we\`re not using the channels we have today : more than 500k stores accept bitcoin (one way or another) and still there\`s not a lot of people using it. Volumes just aren\`t there.
@_date: 2019-10-31 07:02:05


It\`s impossible for it to be "no trading". Adoption means people have to sell BTC for others to buy. Others will buy either as an investment (we saw where that leads) or for real-life use-cases (we haven\`t seen where this leads).  The more BTC moves, the more valuable it gets (because not everybody moves BTC at the same time, people who hold when there\`s demand make the price go up). But for now, we\`re mostly seeing moves on exchanges, what I\`m saying is we should move BTC for use-cases too, that\`s the only point I\`m making.

I\`m not quite sure how you got to that pricing. Current EHS is 91,210,306 / $0.01, this would make the "real price of BTC" = to $9,121,030,600/BTC. for a system a maximum of 43M users( There\`s 43M wallets out there).  No way.
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:11:31
Dunno what this means :/
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:03:34
...:/... I maintain my "Save some, spend some, invest some" thesis. how much in each category depends on everyone\`s particular desires and situation.

I am sorry, I just can\`t agree. I know it\`s a vast generalization and that\`s not really good, but the point I\`m making is that there\`s so many people getting scammed in this space because  of such bad actors. Sure, every industry has them (i pointed to examples), but the way to filter out the good vs the bad is skin in the game. If I know I\`m a game changer, I\`ll work with a huge success fee. If what I\`m after is 5k-50k consultancy fee, while I\`m promising you millions, obviously I\`m scamming.

heh :) I hear some savages prefer tea

Couldn\`t agree more. I\`m fighting the good fight with merchants (getting them to join the ecosystem), but we need active BTC users on both sides of the fence. Thanks for taking the time Mishmash. Always great to meet fellow believers :). Whenever it comes to chicken or the egg, I find the "PR" an online merchant gets from accepting crypto is often a good place to start solving this.
