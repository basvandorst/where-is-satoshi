Agree w/you. Now that I've read the book, he was using Western Union to pay his crew? Silk Road was available. What a dumb-ass! No way could this creep have invented bitcoin.

Investing in crypto is a gamble. But with that said, Id take 20% percent of the remaining BTC and research an alt coin that you can buy cheap. Something that has potential to explode like ZEC, LTC or XMR or another that you believe in and hold tight. And also work your butt off to make cash to cover your btc losses.

Honestly, I feel like these guys are lacking any understanding of the reason why bitcoin or any other crypto has a place in our future. Programmable money will replace fiat. Never once did they mention that.
@_date: 2019-11-05 01:03:05
I upvoted you. Why your getting downvoted for suggesting Cash App is beyond me. Squares Cash App is by far the easiest way to buy bitcoin. My wife is completely tech challenged yet she buys btc with CA. You want your bitcoin to go up in price?? More people using it will do that. CA makes it very ez to on-board noobs.

Wow!! Did Ron just give an open invitation to the upper tier investors or what? The same day that Bakkt had their highest bitcoin trading volume.

Aside from that small part about Lending, I would have to agree that Bitcoin lets you be your own bank.
@_date: 2019-11-10 17:32:49
Robinhood goes against anything and everything that bitcoin was designed for. And lets say you want to withdraw your bitcoin and invest in another crypto they dont support. Guess what? They'll send you a message that says FIVE days to process your request!! By that time you've completely missed out! 
@_date: 2019-11-04 19:37:55
At the end of the day people dont want to be in control of their private keys even if they knew what those are. Just like they dont want to keep cash stashed under their mattress. Banks will always have their place. I think it sucks, but go ask your neighbor if they know what crypto is. They wont. Then ask them what a private key is. They will look at you like your crazy.
@_date: 2019-11-07 05:50:23
Nobody here has a crystal ball, so all the investment advice your getting take with a grain of salt. The best advice is to do your own research. With that said, the true beauty of bitcoin is still far off. Programmers and entrepreneurs are working on all kinds of killer 2nd layer functionality and uses for bitcoin much like the early days of the internet. Its early man. If you were able to go back in time and invest $1,000 in Amazon,  Google, Netflix or any other internet based company would you?
@_date: 2019-11-05 00:20:15
Good point. Squares CashApp is about the easiest way to buy btc I've seen yet.

Yikes, your right! :) was late, brain not working. But yeah, for sure I think its still playing a role. My story is not as grand as the pizza one, but in 2012 I mined 3/4 of a btc, and sold it off for a $250 gift card. Bought a new pair of nikes. I dont even have them anymore. Lol! Doh!!
@_date: 2019-08-09 02:04:24
Correct, but the likelihood of Coinbase just disappearing is low. However, they could be hacked and you are not insured by the FDIC. Get a Coinbase Wallet or Bitpay Wallet and manually write your private keys down.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:51:06
So basically the address contains the .1 btc and you must solve the puzzle to obtain the private key to unlock the address. Correct?

Oh bummer did not know that about Coingate. Looks like Coinbase has a solution for all platforms.  [ Coinbase fee's are very difficult to quantify, but...they are more than likely competitive and still way less than visa mastercard etc. I'd also give your customers the good ol PayPal option.

He's basically saying don't spend it. Hold. Aka hodl. Back in the day (2010) some guy bought two pizzas with like 10,000 bitcoin, it's value was like $30 bux at the time. If he would have hodl, he'd have $800 million.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:32:56
 I think Square is going to add a POS solution for BTC down the road, for now they have the Cash App that allows purchasing and spending of BTC. Also, Coingate has a plugin that supports magento and I think Woocommerce. Shopify has one too. The days of Silk Road are over. The negative connotation of using btc is becoming less and less. So you are headed into the future. Thats how Id sell it. Maybe even let your customers have a little discount, your fees will be waaay less than a traditional cc merchant acxount anyway. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:58:33
Hell yeah!!

The fees will be relativey lower than any fiat backed currency. Regardless of value.

Back in the early days when I was mining w/a 5gh miner I earned about .75 btc, worth $250 bux at the time 2012. I searched hi n low for one of these to cash out, ended up using it to buy a gift card. Bought a pair of nikes with the gc. A $8k dollar pair of nikes! Anyway, these new btc atm's are pretty cool.

The part that he ended with 'China is way out ahead' yet their own Govt discourages ownership of BTC. Seems contradictory.
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:39:51
Yes of course, but it doesn't seem like he's put the time into looking at the tech behind these concepts. So with his influence it seems completely irresponsible. My opinion.

I agree with everything above. If you were to ask Andreas Antonopolus he'd tell you fat old rich guys on wall street are not ready for bitcoin, or more likely bitcoin is not ready for them.  It was a hugely premature idea to deploy bitcoin to institutional investors a few months ago on Bakkt. Does an institutional investor even know what "private keys" is/are? Absolutely not. Everyone needs to calm the fuck down and let the entrepreneurs and developers develop. Faster, cheaper, better will win in the end. Honestly I hope Bitcoin doesn't moon in five or ten years and all the stupid shit heads that are fucking around with it leave it alone to grow organically like it did when it served the Silk Road community back in the day.
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:10:49
The biggest problem is the institutional investors. Never in a million years will they keep their own keys. And if they lose their crypto they will blame somone else. Smart people get a Ledger product and cold store their crypto and physically write their keys down. Unfortunately, most people are not smart and thus we discover once again why banks exist.
