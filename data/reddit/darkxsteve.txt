And back down we go!

In my opinion the price will only go up when bch is available to sell easily.

You might want to wait and see how this dip plays out

Pick me please :)

What's happening tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:37:42
I've sold for a nice profit and I am expecting a dip in the next week or 2. I will buy back in when that dip happens and the worst case scenario is that I have a few less bitcoin when I choose to buy back in

2800 is easy, it's the 2900 barrier that seems to be the hard one to get over

Based on previous good news, I think the price of bitcoin will go down once Segwit is activated. Then about a week later it should moon. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:25:25
In my opinion, but don't take my word as fact. BTC could crash tomorrow for all I know. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:03:31
I don't think it's finished yet
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:04:25
I honestly think we will see a drop at first. The whole buy the rumour sell the news seems to happen a lot in bitcoin but once the sellers have gone

Forever, you already have the bitcoin cash it's just a case of you accessing and then doing what ever you want with it. The same as if you didn't have a way to access your bitcoins you have an unlimited time to access them again.

The best time to buy is today
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:53:53
The way things are going we could be 5k by the end of the week.
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:16:46
0.2 btc but bare in mind I am a student and have only recently started to invest in bit coin so to me that is a lot.

Where is it? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:26:16
From my experience using Coinbase, the price is only frozen for 10 mins, so if you can use that to your advantage then yes but it's unlikely you will be able to.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:20:04
If I was you I would buy soon because the price has gone up literally 600 dollars in the last 24 hours and I can't see it stopping rising anytime soon!
