1. be always suspicious. Prove innocence later. 
2. do not click links embedded in emails - validate first by researching online then use your favorites links or type URL manually 
3. improve your systems' security - up to date OS, drivers, anti-virus, etc.
4. use VPN
5. when browsing the Internet use incognito/private browser mode
the above are just the basics

I read somewhere (not scientific obviously) that only 300K people invested &gt;$5K on bitcoin. That means majority of bitcoin holders are wealthy investors or big institutions.

They are aware of it but not all participating. I saw an online post (not scientific) claiming there are 15M people using cryptos. If that is remotely accurate then it means it's less than of 5% of US population or 0.2% of the world population. So $6K would be a bargain that we will never see when 20% of a population adopts Bitcoin.
