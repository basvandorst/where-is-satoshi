How many business days have people typically waited for their money when withdrawing from GDAX? They say 3-5 but sometimes longer. I'd be moving the funds to Chase if that helps.

If BTC could stop sinking before I withdraw it for walking around money in Vegas next week that would be GREAT

1. Coinbase prices are not the exact spot price on the exchange at the time you buy, they add an extra fee. they also add a fee on the transaction. This fee is even higher if you use a credit card. 
Use GDAX and limit orders to lock in a price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:11:02
Because if it crashes to ~14 as it did last night for 10 minutes and then rockets back up to 16, i want orders to be on the book to try to execute at those temporarily depressed prices.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:24
Yes you want a stop order on gdax, preferably a stop limit order. A normal stop order creates a market order as soon as the stop price is breached. A stop limit order creates a new limit order at a set price when the stop price is breached. Both have issues in wildly volatile markets and on overloaded exchanges. The market order after the stop is breached could execute for hundreds or thousands of dollars lower than the stop price.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:29:27
Jesus christ those spreads on gdax. Stop using market orders people.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:10:15
Crypto Kitties I heard.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:02:21
No, you can access gdax through a mobile browser though, it works pretty well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:50
Limit orders can execute even if the UI is down. GDAX was only completely offline for about 30 mins
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:40:22
Scheduled maintenance was supposed to happen at 10pm PT tonight, this is outside of that
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:29:32
On GDAX you can. You want a stop order.
You'd set a sell stop order at say 14050 when the price hits 14050 a market sell order would be created and execute immediately at the market ask. You can also combine this with a limit order to lock in a price which can be helpful in extremely volatile markets, but you risk the limit order never executing. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:40:27
Coinbase is just a portal to easily and very basically buy and sell. They operate GDAX which is the actual exchange all of their trades happen on. Use gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:24:32
Click "sell" on the exchange. Transfer proceeds to your bank account. Why is this so hard for people, have you never invested in anything before?

Probably both sides.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:04:33
Stop Limits are free though, since when the stop it's a limit order is created not a market order which a traditional stop would create.
Risk is that the price moves so fast past your limit it doesn't fill.

This is how I felt back in 2013 when I bought at 60 and sold at 180 after seeing it run up to 200something. Got back in at various points over the past few months, but it feels crazier than ever.

Your boss is vastly overestimating how smart people are to the point where I don't even believe this is real. People can buy and hold mutual funds and etfs on their own without paying commissions or high annual expenses and yet expensive actively managed funds and high load share classes are still extremely popular. They don't need to go through advisors and yet all the major wirehouses and BDs keep expanding their "wealth management" departments.
@_date: 2014-10-20 18:58:52
I don't disagree with anything you, or anyone has said. Paypal isn't the best system, for all cases, but as you mentioned, if you're already a part of the ecosystem (and your recipient can also become a part)  it is indeed free.
Shortsighted on my part because i'm so used to using paypal and have friends set up on it already, so I'm not looking at the big picture.
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-10-20 16:50:27
Paypal is free

I was a regular on r/pf in 2012/2013 and the common thought around bitcoin was that 5-10% of your investable assets was fine if you were debt free and taking care of your more traditional tax advantaged accounts.

I was able to get coins from coinbase earlier in the week, but it was my first transaction so I don't have the coins in my wallet yet. I've locked in the price, great, but I'd like the ability to convert back into US dollars and lock in some profit should anything bring the price down. Looking into bitfloor now.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:34:33
I picked up 10% more, pretty happy, assuming 75-76 was the bottom of course.

Just as a matter of semantics, you aren't investing, you're speculating. Remember not to risk what you can't afford to lose. I hope you already have stable savings set aside for emergencies and retirement.

Bitfloor, after quickly setting up an account, you can deposit cash at any bank of america branch. That money will be in your account on bitfloor in as little as 30 minutes for some people. Then you can buy btc on their exchange and send it wherever you'd like 
Edit: This assumes a Bank of America is somewhere near you unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-03-27 13:17:19
Exactly, as with any investment, never invest what you can't afford to lose. None of these prices are guaranteed, and past performance does not indicate future results. 
Investing your money within reason also prevents you from encountering a scenario where you need to pull your money out at a big loss, thus having those losses realized. Ride it out!

The only shill here is YOU. You need people to get into bitcoin to prop your investment up. Your manipulative behavior is disgusting.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:49:36
Because they want the value to go back up, so they need to convince people to hold. They wont buy more though, they want you to take care of that.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:09:04
Doubt it will get that low barring a serious catalyst that hurts bitcoins credibility (exhange hack, major online wallet hack, etc). The few pre-weekend sell offs we've had dropped the price about 25% in a span of minutes but it more or less quickly rebounded
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:36:45

Figuring out what wallet client to use is by far the most daunting task (IMO) of using bitcoin. I have accounts at a bunch of online exchanges, and also multibit on my home PC. Transferring money between wallets takes forever though (especially transferring from my multibit wallet to mt gox for trading/buying more. Multibit is also pretty confusing, how safe are my coins? Is it encrypted at all? Do I need to enable additional security, what about my backups? Do I have to resync my backups manually? 
Then I'll also read about the guy who lost something like 90 coins because he deleted his wallet or lost the address in multibit or some other such debacle. Makes me very wary of moving anything anywhere. Also, multibit hast he default .001btc transfer fee which you need to change manually. That's a type of thing I'd expect from my account at Wells Fargo.
@_date: 2013-03-07 15:54:14
I'm a big participant in and also currently taking an interest in bitcoin for information purposes.
Anyway, some of the biggest complaints had (not that he asked) was that he 1. Used a credit card, which will have an extremely high interest rate if he doesn't pay off the balance before his introductory period runs out and 2. he literally invested the only savings his entire family had in a highly speculative investment.
It didn't really seem to me he fully understood the risks he was taking. Yea he mentioned that "he could lose it all and he didn't know what he and his family would do" but I just don't think the suitability is there from a risk standpoint. Wishing him all the best though, and hope he has at least realized some of his gains to pay back all or some the debt he put his family in.

Does the time shorten after you complete your first transaction and become fully verified?
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:57:07
Eh it's kinda solid, it's still hard to understand, hard to buy, somewhat difficult to move around. Oh yea just send it from wallet to wallet. That still costs money unless you want the transaction to float in oblivion for 2 days. Online wallets are crazy unsafe. It's got some problems. None of them are impossible to solve however, so that's a big plus.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:07:39

I finally made the foray into bitcoin a few days ago through Coinbase. My transaction hasn't fully processed yet, but when it does I understand my coins will be stored in a wallet on coinbase's servers. The proper thing for me to do is to have a wallet on my home computer, and store my coins there correct? While also following the steps in this guide to have backups offline?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:22:19
