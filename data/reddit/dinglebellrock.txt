The moment they spent more than a day refusing to allow withdrawals in US dollars is the line where anyone who put money into them afterwards should consider themselves a fool. It was that simple for people capable of thinking for themselves.

So logically inferring that you think in the next three years Bitcoin will reach $30,000. That's a bold and almost certainly a very bad prediction.

No, it only takes a very very small amount of common sense to look at a couple of the markets such as bitstamp.net, coinbase.com or BTC-e to figure out that those prices were a mistake somehow and that no one was paying those prices...

Twice the amount is 200% not 1%. The vast vast majority of people outside of lower income urban areas never experience any real violent crime. Not saying we shouldn't do better by those areas in a lot of ways not just criminal justice areas but your fears and beliefs aren't a reality experienced by most.

Fine. Twice the assault rate and twice the robbery rate  is still not peaceful... And the point was that your nation isn't doing all that great a job of protecting its citizens well being either from violent crime or stressful financial and property crimes regardless of your restrictive gun laws.

I guess if you're talking about firearms crimes. UK has twice the amount of assaults per capita. 22% more property crimes per capita. 35% More car theft per capita. Five times more fraud per capita. Twice as many robbery victims per capita. Hardly the peaceful panacea you make it out to be mate.

Still makes zero sense other than wanting to hodl bitcoin. Your loss leader theory on bitcoin gas is ridiculous.  How many small dollar item large profit margin knick knacks do you think people buy? Certainly not enough to offset 40 cents a gallon off.

Didn't some of the bitcoin based onion drug markets use anonymizers/mixers to protect users? Do those not really work i.e. they can be figured out with enough time/resources or did this site, thankfully, not use one?

It wouldn't and it makes no sense other than the owner might want bitcoin at the price they are now because he is a true believer and thinks it's going to the moon. Credit card fees for signature credit cards are typically 2.3% + $0.10 a transaction. 15 gallons at $3 a gallon would be a $45 transaction.  Which would be a $1.14 fee for a credit card. Even at the high end it's just 3.5% + $0.10 which would be $1.68. Meanwhile the merchant just gave away $6 for a bitcoin fill up...

They don't lose 40 cents a gallon. If that's your premise you're ignorant. From knowing a couple of owners they make a cent or three per gallon profit.
