Your profit/loss will be based on the price of a coin when you initially buy in.  If you buy at $20,000 and it goes up to $21,000 that would be an increase of 1/20th or 5%.  Ergo if you bought $500  worth of bitcoin you would make 5% of your initial investment($500). So, you would make 5% (.05) of your principal of $500 or $25.  If that percentage increase was 50% (I.E. from $20,000 to $30,000), you would make 10 times the profit.  
A good equation would be:
Profit/loss=Principle*Price change %  
This equation would allow you to find your profit/loss for any principle amount.  The Price Change percentage is what you want to keep an eye on and is one of the key reasons I set alerts on the price of bitcoin. That way if it drops below a certain amount I sell before I take a loss I’m not comfortable with and if it goes above a certain amount I know that my buy is still making a profit.  That however is a subject for another thread.  Hope this helps.

Agreed! NEVER, buy in more than you're willing to lose or you will panic at the first sign of a price drop and sell too early.

Bwahaha!  Yeah true.  I mean I haven't looked into the validity of the claim that people are taking out mortgages for bitcoin but if they are  that's the dumbest investment decision they could make.  Assuming a sudden price drop they'll have more problems than a funny walk.  But i think we agree, don't invest more than you're willing to lose and certainly don't go into debt to do it.

True it's all speculative. But that's what investment is all about. You can hedge your risk by looking to the long term/recent past.  You still may lose but at least you're making an educated guess.  My only real point was if you're investing more than is reasonable for your income/savings/investment situation you will either lose it all and screw yourself or sell to soon and miss out on an opportunity. Plus the price of Bitcoin is heavily based on how many people are buying/selling at the time so the longer you wait to sell the less you contribute to any price drops. So it benefits everyone to have people not jumping to sell too quickly.  But yeah you're right there's no way to predict the future.  You can only look at the past and make a hedged guess.
