Everything hand. In gold, the papermarket is about 100x bigger than the physical gold marked. Silver something similar, but it also follows the emotional connection with gold. similar to litecoin with bitcoin.

Last bitcoin presentation I saw the guy also used Humble Bundle. Its very good as an example, only he failed bigtime to demonstrate how fast bitcoin can be and waisted in fact his time, money and whole presentation because of this. The reason was that he didn't prepare for it and it almost looked like it was his first time on the website. Check your phone (battery, camera and internet connection) before the show and add the shortcut of your wallet app on your home-screen. Or when using a computer have the blockchain already fully loaded if using core or have the program already running in the background and check the wifi connection beforehand.
This is the biggest problem I see most of the time when people want to demonstrate bitcoin. Also when using a BTM or paying at a store or bar. mostly the internet connection or messing with different keys.

Scamming bitcoin businesses. This brings a negative view on all the bitcoiners and scare new potential adopters away.

I think its just some kind of tactic (to tell you the truth, I hope it is). I spoke to someone who made big money in realestate post 2009. He told me "Investors are followers, but WB is such a big guy that he's not a follower, but a creator of markets". He told me he just followed what WB did. WB suddenly started to invest in realestate, a market he never was active in before and even after the housing bubble popped. He knew that everyone would follow him and WB know this too. I think he now tries to lower the price even more so he can buy even more cheaper bitcoins and with the next rally he'll help promoting it. Probably with a excuse like "yeah am an old man, to technical for me".
Bitcoin is better than fiat in every way, but its just a baby. It still needs to grow in security, stability, usability, speed and probably a lot of other things first.

The first time I heard about bitcoin is was mainly used to play poker in countries where its illegal. One guy in an interview said "If you play with fake worthless chips everyone takes stupid risks or goes allin all the time without thinking. But if you even use 0.1BTC, which is only 0.01$, the game will make a drastical change to something more serious that'll make it fun."

I can remember his ~~speeches~~ yells about the Amero or something 5 years ago. A joined north American currency that would merch with the euro and yen and would be the end of time as a 1 world currency. Turned out it was pretty bs. OPs coworker probably remembers this fear mongering about the 1 world Amero currency and applies it to bitcoin without any thinking and a lot of pod in his brain.

The bitcoin price isn't directly linked to the development of bitcoin, but to the financial (in)stability of the fiat currencies. People will only adapt it if its a 'better **personal** alternative' than fiat, that'll make the price rise.
In March 2013 was the whole Euro about to collapse like domino day. People needed to find a place to store their value ASAP. Bitcoin was the best/fastest alternative. October/november 2013 the media in the EU was spreading fear about the ECB interest rate drop to 0.25% and China was fking things up with their currency. Today they claim that the crisis is over, so people don't feel the need to find alternatives like bitcoin. You can also see it in the gold and silver rate.
@_date: 2014-11-13 11:40:22
I completely agree with you ...at this point. We need to keep in mind that bitcoin and the possibilities around bitcoin are still in development. Someone is even building something to send bitcoins over radio waves. Too technical for me, but if it works its even better than spreading 3G and smartphones over the world.

Geeky extremely smart people who work on high level technical shit that'll bring mankind a step further don't give a shit what people wear, as long as someone feels comfortable in it. It was a hand made shirt by a (female) friend of him for his last birthday, so it has some more emotional value than some suit you can buy at every store. Its also a very colorful piece of cloth so he probably thought that would be appropriate on such a happy day for mankind.

Yes I know. Thanks to the paper silver market, paper gold market and some market crash attempts. Last year it was so obvious in my eyes, combined with some new banking mess ups, that I thought it couldn't any lower anymore and would collapse halfway 2014. Its pretty amazing how they're able maintain it. Last month was probably the most crazy since 5 years. Demands (mainly china) hits new record hight while the price is declining.

It always wonders me why people think bitcoin is anonymous while one of the first things you learn about it is the openness of all the transactions and addresses. Bitcoin is worse for criminals than fiat. If you catch 1 drugdealer from the streets, you can relate all transactions back of the whole cartel. Including locations of at least the outer circles.

I had a second investment last year. It was silver...
I think I would be fired on the spot and kicked out of the window if I was working for some investment company who needs profits short term. Still I think that both bitcoin and silver are in the top 2 long term personal investments. I only hope it will be sooner than 10 years. or 5.

Bitcoin isn't hard to understand, but hard to explain in a way so someone could understand in a short amount of time. Its a perfect combination of different new software technologies and you can't compare this all to something that already existed. On top of that, as someone at the latest bitcoin meetup said, *"If you want to explain Bitcoin, you have to explain money first. That'll take a couple of day's, then you can explain them everything about bitcoin in about two hours."*

Bitcoin is a currency. Look at the charts of all other currencies and you'll see that the value of the dollar is on its trip to the moon. Almost every other currency is down compared with the dollar. Nothing bad happened with bitcoin, only good things, so the rise of the dollar is probably the main deal.
