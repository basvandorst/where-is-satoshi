Good to know that you are the arbitrator of morality and what is and is not acceptable.
Where did you come up with this notion that his "neighbours" were complaining?
If there are profits in his wallet than it means someone clearly valued his service and could count as neighborly support.
Do the non existent complaints you keep referring to somehow outweigh the votes people are casting with their wallets?

What is so hard to understand is how you consistently and almost seemingly on purpose miss the overarching point here which is that what was done to this man is not justifiable in any sense of the word.

He is being purposely obtuse now.
No need to reply.

What the fuck is wrong with selling hot dogs?
He is providing a service...
Not everything has to be under a corporate banner to be a legitimate thing you do with your life or for money.
I think your perception is a bit out of whack.
This man is out there trying to solve his own problems.
We don't need Uncle Sam to invent more jobs for this man, we need Uncle Sam to ease his thug like grip off all of our shoulders.
At least a little bit.

Purposely obtuse.
A cancer on society.
Lawful does not equate to moral.
False equivalencies be damned.

Your account and responses to the unjust punishment of a man trying to earn a living is the only thing weird in this thread...

I'm on Android so I'll  definitely look into Easy wallet/Glidera. I don't think Indiana has any arbitrary rules about bit coin yet but I'll  look into that as well. Thanks!

Thanks for the reply! I'll  definitely check out purse.io. Any other walet's out there with special perks like this? I didn't even know that was a possible thing 0_0.

Well thank you for the clarification haha! LIke I said, I'm  a new outside of watching the value fluctuate on coindesk hahaha.

Thanks for the reply! I've  been seeing the sponsored adds for Trevor but didn't really have a clue what it was so thank you :).  There's almost too much info available about bit coin and it becomes rather overwhelming in terms of like what I need to learn as a base user and buyer. I'm  still walking around like "Wots a blockchain?" LoL.

But the resurrections are so glorious!
