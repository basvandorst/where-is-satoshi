Making your words bold **doesn't make you cooler or more right**
Here's a better link after 10 seconds of googling. Are you going to defend Libya too? From your name "KillSnowden" I think I know exactly the type of moron I'm dealing with. Are you ex military LMAO.
Again, I don't really care if it's ISIS , Al Nusra , al coka nostra, what the fuck ever. It DOESNT MATTER WHAT HAPPENS AS LONG AS THE REGION IS DESTABILIZED AND PRIVATE CONTRACTORS LINE THEIR POCKETS.

That probably happened too, the problem is a large majority of the American populace think their country is doing good whereas a very small minority thinks Russia is NOT doing shady things.

Do you disagree that the US is just trying to funnel ISIS and FSA against syria like they funneled libyan rebels to take out gaddafi? Do you disagree that Libya was infinitely better off before the US got involved?
As for your question I have no idea some iraqi man probably.
I'll admit I was confused about the ISIS bit though, they got their arms from Iraq which were US funded. What a huge mistake!

One second of googling
The name of the game is to provide weapons to groups that are "moderate". Those groups either defect or are overrun by other terrorist groups who seize the weapons and use them for their own means. THe US doesn't care who wins only that destabilization is achieved

Isis was formed from the syrian rebels the US was directly arming and aiding. They said "fuck this" when faced with actual military force so went back and invaded Iraq. Fuck you for belittling an issue with one meme word
