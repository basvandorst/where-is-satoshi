I wonder how many miners are profitable.
@_date: 2016-04-24 18:43:32
Why does figuring out a farm attacking the network take any longer time than a pool?
And why even wait for an attack? You can take your mining rig when the farm is getting closer to 51%. 
If you believe big farms are bad for Bitcoin, then don't join them, simple as that. Can you do that? If you can, then realize that other miners aren't stupid either. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 15:21:11

1) halving does not decrease reward value. If anything, it's one of the main reasons why the reward worth more.
2) pooling does not increase centralization in the slightest.

I'm not speculating. You're speculating that LN is so good that users will switch from blockchain to LN. 
I'm stating the fact that a) it's impossible to tell and b) using the limit to push users into LN proves that nobody believes LN will be wanted. 


Nonsense, Bitcoin is already being used and the usage is growing every day. The limit is endangering that growth. 


That is simply it's literal and technical purpose - to prevent transactions from inclusion into the blockchain, it's hypocritical to deny it.

Every time miners receive the block reward, they sell some part of it, which creates a downward pressure on the price. After the halving they will have twice as less than before. 
Price = demand / supply.  Demand is the same or higher, supply is lower, price is higher.

The fact that people are voluntarily using blockchain transactions means blockchain transactions are good for them. 
But there's nothing about LN that makes it inherently good, that would make people automatically want it. So the only effect of the prohibitive limit is blocking the established good part of Bitcoin, without any guarantees about LN. 


Not sure what are talking about. The limit is preventing people from using blockchain and LN is intended to replace 99% of blockchain transactions. 
The issue is that there's no way to tell if people would want to use it instead of blockchain. More likely they'll just quit.

@_date: 2016-04-14 14:54:04
LN fans arguing about how good LN is are completely missing the point. It doesn't matter if it's good or bad, because good and bad are subjective. Just because you personally like it, doesn't make inherently good for the network. 
We don't have to argue if ChangeTip is good for Bitcoin, because you don't have to use it. You have a CHOICE. 
If LN were really good, people would prefer it over Blockchain transactions, just like they want to use ChangeTip or other off-chain solutions. But the fact that devs are trying to shove LN down users' throats only proves that they don't believe LN is as good as native Bitcoin transactions. In the end, we're stuck with centralized easily regulated hubs.
Moreover, the assumption that just because users can't send money over Blockchain (because of the limit) they will automatically run into LN for some reason is naively, laughably optimistic. Just as likely they may use ChangeTip, or some wallets, or another currency.

It wouldn't if demand for Bitcoin is always growing despite the fees. See "demand for bitcoins never ends".
(EDIT: Oh, I see what you mean. Maybe Bitcoin will remain as popular as gold now. But most likely demand will decline eventually, so neverending fees rising is just not a realistic scenario).
If fees go down, it's the case "b": demand is declining, i.e. people don't want Bitcoin, they choose cheaper alternatives instead. Good for people, not good for Bitcoin.

I already made my points against this well known myth repeated in your link. Just giving a link that repeats it doesn't prove it. For example,

Again, the assumption here is that there's a way to make a product lasting forever without affecting its price; and the evil manufacturers are deliberately reducing its longevity, which is just silly. 
Increasing the lifespan of a increases its price which a consumer can't and doesn't want to bear. The market finds an equilibrium between demand and supply. 
As I said, nothing new here. If you think I missed something, you're welcome to point it out specifically.

Miners can set their own floating limits any moment. 
If never removed, a hard limit permanently cripples growth of Bitcoin by preventing more and more users using it. It's theoretically possible to add some higher layers though, but it's a big question if users will want to use them without direct access to blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:37:24
It can't just become "centralized" overnight. Warning signs will be seen far ahead. The solution is to let the market correct and regulate itself. 
Millions of users care about their money just like you, many of them have thousands of coins; if they see the number of nodes is dropping to the dangerous level, many will spend some cash to support the network, for the sake of their own security. Worst case, if the danger is inevitable - yes, people will stop using Bitcoin and blocks shrink, until it's safe again. 
But most likely we won't even approach the dangerous level. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 01:37:44


If we reduce the blockchain back to 10gb, there will be no new full nodes. If we reduce it to 1gb and hardlimit the blocks to their size in 2011 - 10kb, number of full nodes will drop.
It has nothing to do with the block size.
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:29:07
How much higher? How long to wait? Zero fee tx can take few days today to confirm. How many times to repeat?  What if both transactions eventually well come through?

No, the context is the same. Profit = revenue - cost. Growing storage and bandwidth is literally an investment into the business of Bitcoin, it will allow more adoption, which will bring higher price, so your profit will be higher because of higher costs.

That's just stupid. A limit doesn't affect cost at all. If blocks grow due to demand, then miners will have higher profits due to increased price. Subsidizing miners by hurting Bitcoin utility won't help Bitcoin, it will only harm its value and the miners themselves.


Decentralization is a function of adoption. Artificially limiting usage limits adoption which limits decentralization.

You're commenting under the very article that [founds]( my assertion. Honestly the evidence is all over the place. There are no sings of progress slowing down, the burden of proof is on you. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:09:41
Pools without miners have no much power. The whole market is always bigger than a pool, unless you're trying to restrict it by limiting its growth. Miners aren't stupider than you, actually they are more interested in keeping Bitcoin decentralized and safe: if a government tries to control a pool, it endangers Bitcoin price and miners' profits, and they must leave the pool for their profits. The market will sort things out. 


You don't know how much that doublespending episode and market reaction actually contributed to the GHash decline. One way or another, it still show why the fear of centralization is groundless: the rise of Bitcoin will bring more miners and more decentralization. Today we have less mining because the price is declining. When BTC = $10K or 100K, we will see the rise of mining all over the planet. 
Most important, limiting Bitcoin growth will not make mining less centralized at all! Miners are motivated by profits, not costs.
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:03:20
The cost for users is 8$. I don't know what profits exactly miners make though, but mining is a very expensive business for sure. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 09:01:08


70x growth in demand? Fantastic, I'm in. 


That doesn't make any sense. Increasing the limit doesn't increase the block size and bandwidth requirements. Growth of blocks today implies growth in demand today. Growth in demand in future means blocks will keep small today. Huge spike in demand will bring significant rise in new full nodes all over the planet. You're suggesting to reject them just because of your personal issues with your ISP today.


I'm not sure what makes you think you can decide transactions made by other people are "unnecessary"; but even assuming your numbers are correct, they prove block limit is irrelevant to them and can be safely raised.

If you don't always need a node, it proves the network doesn't require running a node 100% of time by 100% of users to be trusted.
I want Bitcoin to be regulated by the market, instead of central planners. 
Isn't keeping blocks small enough to be safe is what you want? Then we both want the same thing. The market decides what block size is safe and decentralized and finds the optimal balance between safety and utility, between security and freedom.

If you support fewer transactions, then don't send many transactions. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:06:49
As i said, if there's no urgency, then there's no worry about blocks getting big. If we admit they can grow big due to more users send more transactions, then there's urgency. 
Since Bitcoin is volatile, many people send small transactions. Many do that just out of curiosity to get familiar with the technology. One million sending a 1$ is 1mln$. There's no way to calculate which transactions are worthless and to what extent Bitcoin will be crippled by the limit.
 There's no reasons why we should experiment with the fees right now, it gains nothing, while harming the utility in the process.
If the fork is inevitable than it's safer to pass it now when the network is small than later. Postponing a hard fork doesn't make things easier, there will be more controversy later when the network gets bigger.

By making this argument you're explicitly advocating keeping Bitcoin back in the past when nobody wanted it. You don't see that growth of blocks is directly linked to growth of demand and adoption. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:53:36
Bitcoin isn't ready for mass adoption, it needs to stabilize first. Cascade of new users will probably cause another boom followed by burst which will again turn off many.
@_date: 2015-12-16 23:56:02
Indirectly. By contributing to the network effect, by increasing the number of independent users who don't need to trust a third party, by holding all the transactions and being redy to step in any moment.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:37:56
Not necessarily. Most users will use fancy wallets that control their keys for daily expenses. But we must have a choice to ignore them if we want. There's no need for limits.
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:13:32
But they can (validate transactions) whenever they need. Not everyone at the same time, but that's OK because they just don't need it 99% of the time.
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:47:43


Yes I understand and I suggest you trying to do the same. The cost of adding a transaction depends on resources available to him and the total number of transactions. The cost of a transaction today is about [$6.25]( and it is fully paid with inflation, regardless of any limits. 
The cost can only remain zero if amount of resources is infinite. When total amount of transactions approaches the limit of resources available to the miner, cost increases. You're clearly confusing absence of hardcoded limit with absence of natural physical limits. 
If a miner only have 1Mbps bandwidth, then he can process 75 megabytes of transactions max in every 10 minutes, or 262 transactions per second, even without taking costs of storage and hashing into account. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:35:41
They can't know that. But even if they're right, it isn't a good reason to limit Bitcoin usage while lightning isn't ready. 
Adoption will not happen because of lightning, lightning will possibly be used because of adoption and may help to absorb it. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:08:12
In its true sense, decentralization is unmeasurable, because it happens in the heads of Bitcoin participants, i.e. the market. The most precise possible measure of Bitcoin decentralization is its value, because decentralization is not the goal in itself, but the way of preserving Bitcoin value. Without deventralization Bitcoin has no value, as it's no better than fiat and can be stolen. So as long as Bitcoin has value, it's decentralized enough.
@_date: 2015-06-01 03:14:18
Absolutely not true. Lower price is the least important feature in the modern economy, ask Apple. If price were everything, there would be no offchain products today at all, and obviously here they are. Coinbase or Circle send money off chain between their own wallets. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 14:44:44
The market has determined the decentralization is sufficient. 
A limit that is set not by market is artificial. There is no way for a central planner to calculate the correct limit that wouldn't harm Bitcoin's growth and its value. 
The market itself will set a limit when there will be need for it because of lack of fees or anything.
Preventing growth and value of Bitcoin will only prevent decentralization. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 09:16:38
This ideology:




A production quota on the the amount of transactions people allowed to send and miners are allowed to process is literally a central planning. The notion that "core devs" are limiting us, the market, for "our own good" is central planning. That is exactly literally why central banks exist. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:10:27
It's not particularly straightforward; many don't realize that a hard limit on block size isn't merely a technical thing, it's literally a [production quota]( on transactions, which restricts free trade.

@_date: 2015-06-16 19:11:39


It's not strange if you understand economics. Supply grows faster than demand. Eventually growing demand will translate into rising price, since supply is limited. If you think I'm wrong and price will *never* grow, then Bitcoin can be considered dead already (no demand), so block size or centralization don't really matter. 
A hard limit on transactions is an obstacle in front of growing demand. It is a new cap because for the last 5 years it was effectively non-existent, which files in the face of the idea that raising the limit make blocks bigger. Altcoins have near zero blocks despite similar limits, because nobody uses them, and so they cost nothing. 


Miners cannot set a hard limit to prevent others from processing more transactions when there's demand. They can only set a soft limit for themselves, which is also a reason why a hard limit is useless. 
A hard limit in effect is a subsidy for the biggest mining farms in China, literally what you're arguing for: keeping costs down for them, who already benefit from cheap electricity, labor, and relaxed regulations. You complain mining is centralized by Chinese miners and you want to give them even more. 
Miners tend to unite into bigger pools currently because the price is low and the profits are low. Higher demand for Bitcoin will mean higher price and more profits for miner. But as the limit holds the demand down, it also prevents the price and profits from growing, essentially hurting the smallest miners. More transactions don't always guarantee a moonhigh price, but absence of limit guarantees *maximum* possible profit at the moment for the industry, *maximum* number of competing players, and maximum decentralization. Reducing costs doesn't help if it also reduces profits. 
Size of nodes has nothing to do with centralization. More centralization is more nodes, not "smaller nodes". Preventing growth of Bitcoin prevents wider adoption and appearance of new users, businesses, miners, and nodes. 


How much decentralization is enough? A central plan can't know that. 
You don't have to trust the network if you can't. If you don't run a node, but still send money - it means you trust it and the degree decentralization is sufficient. If there's real danger, more users launch their own nodes for their own security. If there are still not enough security, people use Bitcoin less for sending transactions and blocks get smaller, so it's easier to run a node again. That's how the market balances itself. "Centralization" is a fud. 


No simulation or argument has ever shown the opposite. There're common sense, principles of economics which Bitcoin is based on, and long *real* history of failures of central planning. I know what "simulation" you're talking about, it's based on flawed assumptions and doesn't prove that hitting the limit has more benefits than removing it.

Of course it does. It allows higher layers to be created naturally, all of them require much higher transactions rate than 3 per second. 


Restricting the block size DOES NOT ALLOW higher layer solutions to work normally.


Absurd amounts of transactions implies an absurd level of adoption and decentralization.

If you aren't aware what change in the code we've been discussing here, then honestly I don't know what are you discussing about. 
The change is there - raise the limit and let Bitcoin grow naturally without crippling its utility and value. Blocks will be small enough to be safe, the number of running nodes will be optimal for safety, because other users aren't stupider than you and value their money more than you alone.

But it is already paid. We pay with inflation to miners who run full nodes. They do not "donate" bandwidth, but provide it in exchange for our payments. So far, the payment is sufficient and bandwidth isn't "too much". When the block reward goes away, or blockchain will grow "too much", they can raise the fees. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:31:16
Nothing of that can give any additional information that would prove limit shouldn't be raised. 
Mempools have to be fixed anyway. LN requires a higher limit anyway. 
 
A conditional upgrade is essentially a soft limit. A soft limit can be set or changed any moment with or without a hard limit. Reducing a soft limit will either crash Bitcoin right away or just bring higher fees which restricts adoption and utility, there's nothing new we can learn from it. 
We've already experimented with 250kb soft limit BTW. 
Speaking of fees and limits, economy doesn't work that way. You don't put limits to raise fees, you raise fees to reduce existing demand and usage. Miners should do that themselves when they need.

The cost always has a floor, as long as we live in the real physical world. Mining and processing transactions requires storage, bandwidth, and computing power. Especially when the adoption will reach global level and there will be tens of thousands of transactions per second. 
Even TODAY people voluntary pay non-zero fees. Even with today's 0.01% average fees, the total amount would be $2.6 billions for the [$26 trillion]( global payments volume. But miners will likely to raise the fees when block reward goes away. Or maybe the won't have to, we'll see.

How do new coins, the block reward, comes into existence? 
"When a block is discovered, the discoverer may award themselves a certain number of bitcoins, which is agreed-upon by everyone in the network."
Why can't we agree the same way about another addresses?
block1: Miner rewarded with 1BTC -&gt; addr111
block2: transaction addr111 -&gt; addr222 1BTC
block3: transaction addr222 -&gt; addr333 1BTC
Now, award the addr333 with 1BTC, and cut block1 and block2.

A solo miner alone has no enough power to harm the network. Definitely not with 20mb limit. A pool is controlled by its members. 
Sitting and waiting doesn't give us more data than we have today. Keeping the limit makes it impossible to know how much Bitcoin would grow without the limit, i.e. it gives less data.
Making a small increase doesn't produce any additional data by the time we need another increase. If Bitcoin still works just as it is working today, there will be the exactly the same arguments against the next increase. Centralization, bandwidth, storage.

It will not happen if we keep the limit. Don't you understand that making LN doesn't prove 1MB should be kept? People should WANT to use LN or other layers and naturally prefer them because it provides additional value. Kicking them out of blockchain by fees will not make them run into LN or Coinbase.

Check the reality. For the last year the demand grew gradually and predictibly from 200 to 400kb. Miners don't need to change fees every minute, the right price ensures absence of persistent backlog, it's trivial to guarantee. Your graph shows what happens when miners don't care about fees because block reward is sufficient for them. When the reward goes away, they will set the right fee that will ensure there will be no backlog at all.

There will be no 20mb blocks, the higher limit itself doesn't produce more transactions. But if in fact we'll see 20x or even 5x spike in demand, then being unable to process them will result in a missing opportunity. We can handle 20mb blocks, it's only 170gb per month, and we should welcome them unless we don't want adoption and growth.
The risk of spam is negligible. Miners invest millions not for endangering their own profits. The risk of hitting the limit during a boom is much higher.

What "other miners"? Doesn't make sense, no "other miners" are better than "those miners". Processing transactions is good for miners because it's good for users. Maybe mining of 1MB of transactions by an ASIC miner isn't "good" for a CPU miner with GPRS, but nobody is obligated to keep costs low for him at the expense of the community. 


Doesn't make sense, if you refuse raising the limit now, then nothing will change when we hit 1MB; all the same arguments will stay - fear of "attack" and "centralization" because of bigger blocks. Admitting crisis is possible and just waiting for it to come is illogical - postponing gains nothing, unless a crisis is what you want (which is the only logical conclusion). 


In just a few years 20MB will be as cheap as 1MB in 2010, when the limit was set.

I am increasing the benefit by allowing the utility of the network grow, while you are hoping to reduce costs by crippling the value. Lets throw the engine and the fuel out of car, it will make it run faster, right?
And I don't really see how I'm increasing the cost. Running a node today is no more expensive than 3 years ago, while the value of it has increased vastly. 
Imagine if we locked blocks into 10KB in 2010. Would it make running a node more desirable today? No, because there's no point in running a node if there are no users in the network.
Full nodes mostly benefit themselves. Nobody forces them to run a node if they can't. If there's a real danger of centralization, the value of your own node increases. So the market balances itself. 


[The clear empirical fact]( I'm surprised anyone would dispute it. "Centralization" on the other hand is a meaningless buzzword. How many nodes is "decentralized" enough?

But it's you who want to "do something" because "we don't know the future". And you think you can change the fees for miners because... you assume miners in future themselves can't?.. because we don't know the future? It doesn't make any sense whatsoever, you're just making things up. 
The miners profit tends to the market equilibrium, not zero, it's called "competition". 
If people can't run a node and don't trust the network without their own node, then they shouldn't send money. Fewer people sending money = fewer transactions = smaller blocks = easier to run a node = more nodes = more trust = more adoption = more nodes, market finds its equilibrium.
@_date: 2015-06-08 08:04:44
Mining is never free. If it were free, then fees should be zero. But it's not, it requires bandwidth, storage, processing power, human labor, and the requirements will be huge when Bitcoin reaches global level and block reward goes away.

Bitcoin was never intended for every last user to run a fullblown wallet. If that's what you want, then it doesn't make any sense. A user can still run Bitcoin-QT, but there are many much better solutions for him. From the very beginning the idea was that most users will run lightweight clients, so that we could stop worrying about how big blockchain gets; and now there are plenty of them, including higher layers who can send transactions without touching the blockchain (Circle, Coinbase, Changetip, etc) - which potentially naturally reduces Blockchain growth by the way. That's exactly what the plan was since the very beginning.

It's not about you. There will be more full nodes, and I didn't say you personally have to run one.  Decentralization is more nodes in general, not "small nodes", or "your nodes". More pools, more miners, more businesses running their nodes for their own validation.  The assumption that "small nodes = decentralization" is based on a fallacy that Bitcoin is a limited pie that doesn't grow. LTC or Doge have 10kb blocks now, it doesn't make them decentralized.
What you're trying to do is to cripple Bitcoin just to keep life easy for you personally. But it will not cause more nodes to pop up in the air. It will prevent new nodes instead. 
Also, not everyone in the world has crappy upload, and we're talking about worst (or best) case scenario, actual 20MB blocks will likely not happen in 10 years.

There's no subsidy: miners pay for the bandwidth to process and propagate transactions, nodes pay for themselves to accept them and relay them if it benefits them for whatever reason. If running a node isn't worth it, then they should absolutely stop doing it.

I don't care which supplier will send my transaction, don't tell me what I "require", all I want to know if it comes through and if the price is acceptable to me. I know what they deliver after making the first transaction, or by asking other customers. 


Exactly, this is why trying to "calculate" or "guess" fees is just silly. Miners should announce their fees explicitly. To do that, they should care about fees in the first place, which is not true until the block reward is sufficient for them.


His scenario holds true for attempt of artificially enforcing a "market" with a hard limit, when miners don't care about fees yet.  When block reward diminishes, they will be fully capable of settings their own fees and limits to control the amount of transactions.

"With some 1.7 billion cardholders and a multiple of this in transactions, VISA is by far the largest credit card issuing company in the world. Together with MasterCard, an astronomical 62 billion transactions are made each year. This works out to 1,971 Visa and MasterCard transactions per second. 
So, to handle 1.7bn users Bitcoin only needs 2k average tps. Of course there are some much higher peak numbers, but they aren't occurring every day. 2k tps = 600MB block every 10 minutes, or 1+1 megabyte per second (upload+download) minimum. That seems doable even today. But it will likely happen in 20 years, when internet and storage will be much cheaper.


It has nothing to do with limits. Just create an attractive useful wallet and people will use it.

As long as space is available, fees should be zero or near zero. When space is not available or block reward isn't sufficient, then the cost of transactions is not zero, and miners are free to raise the fees. It doesn't require "collusion", the free unrestricted trade will set find equilibrium of fees. Even without any limits, the fees would be astronomical, when the block reward diminishes.

Increasing the limit does not increase the block size; even if blocks will increase, there's no logical reasons why Bitcoin should subsidize some miners who have deliberately chosen to move into rural areas for the cheap electricity and maybe will have to pay higher costs for bandwidth. Besides, by the time blocks actually become 20MB the internet in China will be cheaper. 
You ignore the real cause behind growing number of transactions and the impact to Bitcoin's utility, value and centralization of artificially limiting them with a newly imposed cap.


There's no reason to believe that 1MB is better than 10KB or 10MB, other than that 1MB is holy and magical. Believing that 1MB limit is good in 2015 is just as meaningless as 100KB in 2010. If your logic is correct, it implies the lower the limit the better.

Blocks are unlimited because the demand for transactions is still lower than the limit. 10MB would result in orphaned blocks for a miner, you'd have to pay a price higher than the block reward; which makes no sense for both of you, since he endangers his business.
Miners can configure any fees they want. They mostly ignore them because they are paid with the block reward. 
We know we live in a physical world, and processing, sending, storing transactions has costs; we know the full costs today and there's no reason it will be free in future. Besides, it's implied by the question that 1GB is a lot of data to process. If it can be done for free, then there's no reasons to worry. 
It's impossible for security or fees to drop, that theory makes zero sense. A miner left alone can set any fees and make huge profits; plus, reduced hashrate will result in reduced difficulty.

I see your point now. It's not a problem to limit the number of incoming connections, to keep bandwidth consumption low and still benefit the network. 
If the network health still drops, it motivates other to either run more nodes, or stop sending money which will reduce blocks and make running a node easier again.

Why enforce? The same way we agree that every miner receives 25BTC for a block. Introduce a patch in a Bitcoin-QT and everyone will update.

That's a meaningless declaration, since you can't define what is decentralization. 
What indisputably clear is your wish to reduce the number of transactions, we wouldn't be discussing it otherwise. Decentralization isn't the goal in itself, but a measure for providing safe transactions. Transactions are the value of Bitcoin. The value grows with the number of users sending more transactions. Reducing costs by reducing perfectly safe transactions is crippling Bitcoin utility and value. Which actually reduces decentralization. 
You're making assumptions again: value is constant, cost increases. Both are wrong. Value grows with usage, cost is reduced by progress. 


You're not the only user in the network, if there's actual danger, it's dangerous not only for you but for everyone. Then more and more users run a node because its value increases, and danger reduces. 


Exactly my point! Any attempt to declare a "good" limit to provide a "good enough decentralization" would be a failure. No matter to what extent you're reducing Bitcoin usage by a hard limit, it is erroneous. 
The thing is, decentralization is subjective. It can be correctly determined only by the market. The network is decentralized and safe enough if the market decides it is. If people send their money, it's because it's safe for them. *In Bitcoin* transactions are the baby, because people subjectively measure the amount of security and decentralization by using the network. A hard limit not only cripples utility of Bitcoin, it restricts transactions that are *perfectly safe*. 


Supply and demand. a) miners set their own limits. b) users decide if the network is safe enough. 
If centralization becomes a real danger, just as you said: "so centralization may move me to not use Bitcoin", people send less transactions and blocks reduce. The market is best at regulating itself.

You can't predict what usage and what amount of adoption will be prevented by higher fees without need. You want to deliberately cripple real Bitcoin utility out of imaginary reasons.
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:53:36


Now you're just playing with words. You technically can send money if the fees are higher than the amount being sent, but financially you can't. There were people who could, who contributed to the value, and now they can't. That's what happens after congestion. They do not pay higher price, they just stop using Bitcoin - you said that.
1mb kept forever means 99% users can't send money. You're just limiting the user base. Artificial limits do not cause innovation! Mass adoption does. 
 Transferring value is the very idea of Bitcoin or any money. It doesn't matter if you send BTC every day, what matters if you can or not send them any moment. If you don't control your money, you don't own them, they have no value for you. That's the idea that hasn't changed since 2009, but it will change if the limit will remain in place forever.

Today the price is declining, miners' profits too. Considering the price went down from 1200 to 220, it's amazing how distributed the network still is.
Global adoption equals astronomical price. Imagine the level of distribution if BTC = at least $10k. Or 100k or $1mln.

Best case scenario - fees rising, less people using Bitcoin than could, adoption stalls unnecessarily, utility, value, and price are constrained.  
Worst case scenario - crash landing, users panic and abandon Bitcoin; the network recovers eventually, but the momentum is lost and Bitcoin reputation is crashed again.

It prevents inefficient players from losing their share and freezes the status quo among the miners by letting the biggest ones grow their share at the expense of the smallest.

It's impossible to surpass physical limitations of technological progress, so there always will be some invisible bounds. But they always grow, unlike the 1MB or any other artificial limit. 
Removing the block size limit isn't a solution to everything, it's a prerequisite; it allows for any other solutions on top of it.
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:20:38
Of course it's possible even right now. 2000 TPS average for 1.7 bn card holders = 600MB block, 1+1 megabyte per second minimum. Not easy, but doable.
Lightning is completely irrelevant to the block size debate, it doesn't justify keeping any limits, it still requires much bigger blocks than 1mb, and if people will actually it, it makes the limit pointless. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:52:31
Regardless of TPS of the layer, it still requires an unpredictable number of transactions on blockchain which cannot be restricted without harming the utility. 
If it's the same currency, then people will want the layer and the limit is useless. But if the assumption is incorrect, and people still value blockchain over the layer, then limiting them is harming the utility. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:08:31


Blocks grow because people send more transactions. People send more because danger is lower (nobody uses altcoins, their blocks are empty). 


He only needs to run it if it increases his personal safety. If Bitcoin becomes more dangerous, if you can't send a transaction without your own node, then people send fewer transactions, and blocks reduce. Market will sort things out.
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:58:37


I was explaining why I called it a "subsidy": even though we don't have a way to subsidize nodes directly, a hard limit on transaction is also a form of subsidy to nodes (to reduce costs for them). 
Yes, miners can set their own limits and raise the fees, if they want. 


I would to, but the questions are a) at what cost? b) how do you calculate the proper compensation? If you impose fees or hard limits to motivate nodes, it may also discourage users from sending transactions, and there's no way to determine manually the precise value of equilibrium.  I believe market is best at finding its own balance between costs of running a node and sufficient security.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:34:53
There is no such thing as "infinite blocksize", there are physical limits. 
If fees paid are not sufficient for some miners to continue operating, and they quit, let's say there's only one miner remains. Now he can set any fees he wants and have huge profits, which attracts new miners. This is trivial market situation, market finds equilibrium fees to support the industry, just as fast food finds the optimal hamburger priceю 
If hashing drops, then difficulty drops, which also makes it easier for new miners to enter the market. 
The theory you describing makes absolutely no sense, minimum fees are just as economically harmful as minimum wage laws. Even if today's fees remain unchanged, the global transaction volume will generate several billions $ in fees. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 09:28:36
I'll do offchain transactions only if I can do on-chain freely. Without that choice, offchain is useless. Blockchain gives value to offchain, not the other way around. I agree that most transactions in future will be offchain, but not because people are kicked out of blockchain by fees. Limiting transactions won't bring any good. Higher layers will develop naturally, by bringing added value to Bitcoin, or will not develop at all. We don't know how many transactions needed for the global adoption, but for sure it's not 3 per second. Any artificial limits will only slow down adoption and development of higher off-chain layers.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:26:39


My opinion is it isn't realistic in the first place. The high rate of usage *implies* that Bitcoin is safe and decentralized, because people using it have decided that it's safe for them. It implies BTC costs $100k (high demand) and the mining is hugely profitable and therefore decentralized. It implies the year is 2030, and the internet and storage are much faster and cheaper.
The point is, people aren't stupid. Just like you, they won't send their money if it isn't safe. And the blocks will get smaller. But if they do, it's because they see Bitcoin as safe. 


I'm asking a rhetorical question: assuming people use Bitcoin 200x more than today, how is it *logically* possible that Bitcoin isn't working for them, for any reason? Why do they send their money then?


Miners aren't stupid. They don't want to risk their profits, they know the physical limits of their own hardware, bandwidth and storage capacity. They can set their own soft limits accordingly. Well if some don't, they only harm themselves. 
An "unrecoverable software failure" - you're saying there can be an unknown *software* bug in Bitcoin which crashes due to bigger blocks? Well it's trivial to test and fix.


I guess that's theoretically possible, but unlikely, since miners invest millions in their business. Still, some limit can be useful, but it needs to be WAY bigger than the sizes of the actual blocks. Do you realize, in 2010, when the 1MB was set, blocks were only 300 bytes large? After 5 years, we have 400KB blocks, internet is much faster, and the limit is still the same.
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:25:08


Um.. No they can't. To do that, they need miners first. Miners need to pay their electricity bills then. They pay by selling coins to users. Users won't value bitcoins if they  can be stolen by miners or harmed other way. Without users they have zero power. It's a market. The market has all the power. Miners, pools, have to follow the market if they want to survive and profit.
Creating a "consolidated mining structure" doesn't prevent anyone from creating another structure just like it, if mining is profitable. The same way the existence of GHash couldn't prevent Chinese miners from entering the market with their gigantic farms, motivated by the 1200 bubble. 
See the big picture. The consolidation we see today is merely a temporary thing caused by the recent downward trend. We need to look in the future instead of fixating on temporary issues. If we expect Bitcoin to eventually rise again, then mining will be hugely profitable and decentralized. Any real attempt to harm Bitcoin will devalue it in the eyes of the market. Which, by the way, will cause people to use Bitcoin less, to send fewer transactions, which will make blocks smaller again. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:12:48
It's simpler, blocks from 2009 to 2015: 200b, 500b, 10k, 50k, 130k, 210k, 400k, there was a jump in 2011, but there's no 300% every year. 
Keeping 100% annually we'll get to 8mb in 2020. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:40:52


We'll never scale to 7B if we simply restrict Bitcoin usage to random numbers like 1MB. We would be where we're today, had we set a hard limit 100kb two years ago.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:43:04


If blocks get bigger, it's because someone is processing them. And they do because they know users are sending more transactions and predict the need for upgrade. And they know that, because EVERYONE knows that. We all see when transactions grow, blocks grow and there's need for more space. So I have no idea what are you talking about.


The decentralized nature of Bitcoin doesn't mean it's "collectively owned", it means NOBODY has a property rights to it, which means nobody is entitled to hold the blockchain if he can't. If you can't run a node - it's because *someone else can*, and because the network grows and *demands more and more transactions*. What you're suggesting is to suppress utility of Bitcoin to the lowest possible denominator. It's like the opposite of what Bitcoin is created for.

Visa has 2000 tps average with [1.9bn cardholders]( (Actually 2000tps number is [combined with Mastercard]( so maybe it's even lower for Visa alone).
I don't think it's reasonable to expect that level of adoption in next 20 years. Bitcoin will not get mass adopted before stabilization, but we'll be able to handle it even in 10 years. 
EDIT: Also, let's not forget Visa is essentially a monopoly, and Bitcoin will have plenty of competition. Also, most of users will be using off-chain wallets for daily expenses. Not because of fees, but simply out of convenience, like they use Circle or Coinbase today who send transactions between their own wallets without touching the blockchain. So, I'm sure Bitcoin can easily scale and we can handle global adoption even if it happens in 10 years. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:23:28
You don't know what you're talking about. It won't be cheaper, blocks will be clogged and transactions just won't come through.

You're missing why Bitcoin is popular. Your assumption that Bitcoin will be popular no matter what is groundless and doesn't make sense, which is indicated by you insisting that Bitcoin can succeed with 10kb limit.
If congestion happens, it is because people want to use Bitcoin - that is correct. But the reason why they do, is because Bitcoin has been working flawlessly for them before. And after congestion occurs, Bitcoin loses its users who are unable to send money anymore.
 Now there is no congestion - because people have stopped using Bitcoin. That's your own words. What's beyond my understanding is why someone would think it's good for Bitcoin.  No people - no adoption - no value. Do you think inability to withdraw money from MtGox made people want to use it more, or the opposite?
You think payment processors will use Bitcoin then? But who are they going to process for? People have left already. You think they are coming back? What for? You think people will suddenly jump to payment processors? Some maybe, but the most will not. Why, if they didn't want them if the first place? Bitcoin is valuable because of its ability to send money without a third party, not the other way around. Without that feature Coinbase is no different from PayPal.
The network was not crowded back in 2009 - because nobody wanted it. It even could work with 10kb limit for a year. Until people would realize they can't send their money and Bitcoin doesn't work as advertised. 
We would never be able to grow to the point where we are today with 10 KB block. And we can't grow with the 1mb limit kept forever. If Bitcoin can't grow, it dies.  And there will be no decentralization if there's no users. 
1mb limit is only known as safe because we're not hitting it. Because Bitcoin is working as if there's no limit. 250kb was also safe, until it wasn't.
@_date: 2015-06-09 07:56:52

Perhaps I should've been more clear about this: a hard limit is a measure to keep life easier for the people who run nodes, by restricting the amount of transactions miners are allowed to process. 
Miners are essentially selling transactions to users. So, a hard limit in a way gives a benefit to a node by taking it from users and miners, it's a form of subsidy. 


Why should we support them specifically? Is the network is safe, it's safe for everyone. If it's in danger, it's in danger for both SPV and those who are able to run a node. If SPV still don't feel safe, they stop sending transactions  and the blocks reduce, so it's easier to run a node again.

The debate is about "whether miners can be profitable without the block size limit". The "externality" argument implies miners profit by putting their costs at the others. Which means, there's no problem with miners and their profits.
Now, the "exernalities" assume "common property", but there's no "common property" in Bicoin. Blockchain isn't "commonly owned", by launching a node you don't get the property rights to blockchain. Nobody has a property rights to blockchain. 
So, you can't demand from others keeping costs low for you. It's like buying a hamburger and then demanding to make it vegetarian. You're buying a hamburger/node for yourself. When there's a demand from market for fatter hamburgers/more transactions, keeping costs/fat low for you personally would be an equivalent of redistributing benefits from the market to you, it's a welfare. 
I seed because others seed for me. I will seed more if the network in danger due to dropping nodes. You may call it, "idealistic", but to me it's pretty rational, I'm supporting what's valuable for me personally.
What's more important, there will be fewer like me if we restrict number of users in the network by restricting transactions.
Also, what costs are we talking about? I send about 1GB per day with 20 incoming connections. Multiply it by 20 right now and it still not an issue. And I can restrict it to 5 connections. 


There's a market for node services: wallets, mining pools, other bitcoin-related businesses run full nodes for money they receive. 


He (and you) is directly quoting the mainstream pseudoeconomic theory which justifies central planning. Socialism doesn't work even if we organize it voluntarily. Simply because central planners always have less information about the market than the whole market itself. Mandating minimum fees for the market, planning number of transactions to sell - this is all a communist rubbish. I'm fed with this, I was born in USSR, it's unbearable to see the same nonsense in supposedly "capitalist" countries. "Unregulated free market leads to monopolization (so we need a government monopoly)" - this is Lenin himself.

Because the supply of btc is rising faster than adoption as I just explained.


More Hearn doublespeak.
Ah , ad hominem because you have no arguments. 1mb is a new cap because it was never in effect, and you're arguing for a subsidy for the biggest miners, you can't deny that, and I've no idea what does Hearn has to do with it 


How does it prove that hard limit isn't a subsidy or that miners can't set a hard limit? 
Pooling has nothing to do with centralization. There can be numerous pools if BTC is high and profits attract new players to enter the market. Lack of profits reduces invectives for competition and makes smaller pools harder to survive.
Centralization is what market sees as centralized and unsafe. As long as people use Bitcoin it implies the market values it as safe and decentralized enough.
Why do you think people would  send more and money to a system (more and more transactions) if it's not secure? Either blocks aren't growing because it's centralized and insecure, or people use it more and more because it's decentralized and secure. Your theory of centralization is a nonsense on its face.

Bitcoin has seats - blockchain capacity, it has tickets - admission by miners to process a transaction, and a posted price - a minimum fee announced by miners. 






What queue, what other clients? There is no queue, and there are only 2000 clients, because the fee is high. Miners post the price of 1BTC per transaction, and there is only 1 person willing to send money in a day for that price. Do you really have no idea how pricing works? Have you ever sold anything?


No, it depends on how many transactions there are at the moment and how fast the rate is growing. Capacity 2500tps, current rate is 2000 tps, fee is 0.0001BTC. Next day it rises to 2200, then 2300, 2400tps, miners announce 0.01BTC + 0.5% fee and reject anything with a lower price, people stop sending money, now it's 2000 tps again.

He [explicitly]( agreed to 100GB transactions per day, or 700MB blocks every 10 minutes in 2008.


would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

There will be no mess, and blocks will not be full: the purpose of pricing mechanism is to control the number of transactions so that they do not even come close to the limit. 
I.e. miners tell wallets: "warning: we are approaching the limit. from now on, transactions with a fee lower than X will be rejected". People see the fees have increased and send less transactions. Voila.
It's in users' interest to include a fee that miners will accept for their services. You don't have to "trust" a seller, you can either accept his offer or just don't send money. It's just how market works.

Nobody "forces" you to store anything, if you don't benefit from trustless operation and faster confirmations, nobody asks you to run a node. We only need nodes that increase security. If running a node doesn't increase security for you personally, subjectively, then it's worseless.


There are no such incentives, bandwidth costs them money too.

These works incorrectly assume constant internet speeds and instant 8MB blocks, which contradicts the empirical evidence.

It is already constrained naturally, miners can set their own limits, if adoption grows faster than their ability to process it with the equipment available.


Users already have vote, we vote by our coins and dollars. If we use blockchain less (e.g. because bigger blocks made the network less secure), blocks reduce in size. Any other "voting" mechanism is akin to politics, please don't reinvent Federal Reserve. 


Why 75%? Why not 78.3%? If miners can and willing to process higher demand for transactions from users, we need more such miners. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:27:41


Of course we do, what are you taking about? We know today that 0 is low, 0.0001 is high, because that's what most miners accept; we will know if they change their prices - because they will tell us; even without telling we would find out eventually.


Where did you get that nonsense? Nobody has to guess, miners will tell us, they will raise the fees explicitly if they see blocks are getting full, and users will send fewer transactions.

This is factually incorrect, the economic principles were observed and formulated long before creation of Bitcoin, and your "computer science" is worthless without being used to implement correct economic principles.

The economics properties of Bitcoin have emerged because it was predicted by economic principles behind it decades ago.

Every time blocks approached a soft limit, miners willingly raise it. No reason to believe someone would deliberately refuse making bigger blocks when there's demand for more transactions and the resources are sufficient. And even if we would, then keeping a hard limit is pointless. A hardlimit is there precisely to prevent activity that people WANT.

Mike paid for them. No matter how you twist it, there's no free lunch, miners sell their coins to Bitcoin users, who pay for them. Those who buy bitcoins are Bitcoin users. Miners wouldn't be able to process transactions for the daily fees of 15BTC with their electricity bills and all their multimillion mining rigs.
$8 is the average cost by the definition of "average" - revenue divided by the number of transactions. Yes, by sending more transactions the average cost will drop, that's 3th grade arithmetic. Sorry if this is too difficult for you. 
I don't even know what so upsets you. Those are trivial facts: miners have expenses; someone pays for them; The topic discussed was that without the inflation miners would have to cover the same expenses directly through fees.


Right, a crucial detail which changes everything, except it doesn't. Suddenly you're ok with the fact that cost per bitcoin transaction is considered by blockchain.info, but trying to make a point that it's not a big deal in USD transactions. What if I told you, just because you ignore it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. The only reason why you don't notice USD inflation is because it's very mild compared to BTC.
I'm asking you again: is taking inflation into account absurd? Maybe we should also ignore fiat inflation? Why have we created Bitcoin? Ever heard about inflation tax? 
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:35:48
We're all early adopters and Bitcoin is still a risky asset; I believe most of us educate ourselves about what we're putting our money and time into (I'm judging by myself). If you think others lack knowledge, you should educate them about dangers and benefits. 
But that's actually irrelevant to the discussion, because if people in fact don't care about the security of their own money, then noting will motivate them to increase that security by running their own nodes. 


But would it be a good thing? There's no way to tell what transactions are useless and how many users will be rejected and what growth will be prevented by new fees. 
I actually don't think sending money should be free, because nothing is free. But we already pay the real cost with inflation, otherwise miners wouldn't be able to process our transactions. The reward at the moment is 2.17% of the total transaction volume, which is the actual fee we pay: 
When the block reward goes away, miners will raise the fees and set their own soft limits.

Why is this a problem? Isn't it the way of limiting the block size naturally? Actually it would become a problem if miners could include unlimited amount of transactions without affecting their performance.

@_date: 2015-06-10 17:32:15
Here's the reason why the alleged implications of this data (bigger blocks = less nodes) are wrong.
Imagine if we go back to 2013 and set the hard limit to 100KB (blocks were 100kb in 2013). Now return to 2015. Fees are much higher, blockchain is only 15GB. Do we have more nodes or less than 6000? I think, even less, less people use Bitcoin because of higher fees, and blockchain size isn't much different. 
Or even simpler. Let's today reduce the limit to 100KB and find a way to compress the blockchain to 10GB (the size in 2013). Will the number of full nodes increase or decrease? It will not increase a bit, but we'll kick out many users out of Bitcoin and prevent entering many new in future.

I believe fees can work. Wallets must be prepared in advance before approaching the limit and miners should collaborate with wallets to decide generally acceptable level of fees. No other actions required.
Not now, but in future, if blocks get too big and miners will want to set soft limits, or after all coins will be mined.

Are you kidding me? So the price should be raised. Why is it so difficult?
Miners have whatever pricing policy they want. They can reject all lower-fee transactions if they cause backlog. They already reject zero-fee spam. 
Miners include most txs today because they don't care about fees yet, as long as block reward is sufficient. They will raise fees in future. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:03:52
What has changed, you kidding? Blocks were less than 1kb then. Today they are approaching 1mb fast.  Satoshi warns about incompatibility of a fork, not rejects the patch altogether, and later he explains how we should phase it in to avoid incompatibility
" it can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade."
Which means the upgrade must be started in advance to pass safely.


"That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal."
What has changed? The *network has become that big*.

1mb blocks are too small,  spamming is too cheap. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:14:04
You can't "just fill the blocks". Transactions cost money, mining costs huge money. Less than a day [(100 blocks)]( of a stress test has costed the tester about $5k. Which may seem not much for a wealthy organization or person, but only because the limit is low, and the duration was short. Now try the same with at least 20MB for a month, and it's over $4mln. It's theoretically possible, but I'd say if someone is trying to waste millions on attacking Bitcoin, then it's pretty successful. And don't forget fees can be easily raised. 
Speaking of miners, even today you'd need to spend tens of millions on mining equipment to send several blocks a day.

Instant, free, stable - is exactly what Bitcoin created to be, not reinventing damn SWIFT or western union. Just because not all users are ready to abandon Bitcoin yet, *doesn't mean you're not kicking them out deliberately* **without any need**, when the decentralization is safe and secure, when the boom is happening and smooth growth is vital more than ever, and when the network itself is willing to accept and process their transactions, hadn't it been for the limit. 


You think you know what people use bitcoin for, and how valuable small transactions are? What about HD wallets and mixers? Do you realize how they increase the utility of Bitcoin? Can you predict the effect of people not able to use them?


So you're not only willingly crippling Bitcoin adoption, you're even bragging about it.


Even they can't work with 1MB.

It's far from free, we are paying for transactions with inflation. Miners accept almost all of our transactions because the payment is sufficient. When it will be not enough, or when we'll be using too much space - they will raise the fees.

This is worse, not better. The problem isn't not enough power in the hands of a majority, but a majority having too much power to freeze the status quo in spite of growing demand. The real majority in the market who we should be worried about is the customers who send transactions. 
I don't understand why people are obsessed with China. If blocks in fact get bigger due to higher demand that Chinese couldn't handle, that would mean the market forces are breaking up the big player (others will replace them due to reduced difficulty); but voting gives them even more power instead. 
The voting on the block limit turns the dynamic floating system that responds and adapts to market forces info a rigid centralized cartel of privileged existing miners. Like in the real world, any centralized measures against centralization bring more centralization instead.

Any layers require increasing the limit. The need for any higher layers doesn't prove that keeping the limit is somehow beneficial. 
You don't know what is the correct block size. The block size should be restricted naturally, by people WANTING to use higher layers, not because they are kicked out of blockchain, and possibly by miners setting their own soft limits according to their abilities to process transactions. Otherwise it will mean that people can't choose the best option at the moment.

The assumption that 1MB is the best limit for security is subjective. The assumption that it doesn't hurts Bitcoin's performance in other aspects is random.

We don't know is it safe to hit the 1MB limit without an option to raise it quickly, as a soft limit. We don't know how much growth, adoption, decentralization will be prevented by higher fees from a newly imposed cap that was effectively non-existent for the last 5 years.

It can be set by algorithm, but that would be pointless, since the demand is more or less stable, predictable, and easily observable. Significant change in fees is needed when demand radically changes and supply isn't able to catch up, or when demand drops noticeably. It doesn't happen often, so the fees can be changed manually. 
It's absolutely no different from VISA fees or McDonalds pricing. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:38:15

Miners run nodes too, they can't mine without a node. 
If you're not a miner, you do that for yourself - you get the benefit of trustless operation and faster confirmation. If it's not worth it, nobody asks you to do that.
If miners wouldn't lower limit it's only because they will think the fees are  sufficient. Putting a limit without a need creates unintended sequences by raising the fees unnecessary and preventing wider adoption (economics 101, higher prices reduce demand).

Miners lose the orphan race by arbitrary inflating their blocks. A solo malicious miner who doesn't care about losses can't do much, since the attack is expensive, the harm is minimal (who are you going to scare with your 128MB block once in a day in 2025?) and easily recoverable.

The "voting" part of BIP100 bothers me. Existing miners can prevent blocks from getting bigger to curb the growing market and thus preventing new players from entering it.

There's no increase (in size of blocks) at all. The 1MB limit wasn't affecting size of blocks for the last 5 years. The actual increase will be according to demand. 


Most developers reject any increase until the actual crisis occurs. In other words they want to put Bitcoin in actual crisis when it's most dangerous and harmful - during a boom.
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:00:56


The miners' incentives at the beginning were literally zero, BTC costed nothing, and yet the difficulty was only rising.
Without the block reward, miners can set any limits and charge any fees they want. The incentive is all the fees in the world. Even without limits, the fees will be astronomical, the same way users pay fees today for faster confirmation.


Of course you can, only statists interpret the game theory as an excuse for central planning. That's what statists do.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:10:59


How? 600 MB every 10 minutes = 1 megabyte per second = 8mbit. Let's say, 8 incoming connections = 64 mbit (can be limited to 2 or 3 connections). Traffic volume will be huge though, so you'll need a dedicated channel, but it's still quite possible. 
Even 1.3GBit is available today. Assuming Bitcoin is used by 1.7 billion users, the insane profits from the astronomical transactions volume will cover all the costs for miners, businesses, and nodes, who need a personal node for personal security. 


So, LN doesn't justify keeping the limit, unless we reduce the Earth's population to 30 mln. I'm glad to hear the intention isn't to reduce transaction volume; but even an anti-spam limit shouldn't be kept close to size of actual blocks, due to risk of an unexpected spike in demand.

Bitcoin always needs continuous unrestricted growth, for the next 30 years at least. On the other hand, the risk of serious spam attack is minimal due to its cost, it would be an extraordinary event.
Today someone could spend tens of millions dollars to attack Bitcoin, but it would be pointless, since Bitcoin is tiny. In 10 years, a similar attack will cost a billion, and again, the effect will be minimal, because Bitcoin will quickly recover and will only become stronger. So, the cost of attacking Bitcoin through a miner is always much higher than effect. 
Restricting Bitcoin's growth for the sake of avoiding an attack that is very unlikely and can be overcomed easily.
Maximum decentralization is achieved through mass adoption. More people will want to run a node not because it's cheap, but because it's beneficial for more and more people. Restricting growth potentially restricts adoption and prevents wider decentralization.

" function f that returns the penalty for a given block size."
Another attempt at central planning. Fear of monopolies and regulation of growing market. Why should miners be punished for fulfilling demand? They know themselves whether blocks are too big or not. Would you people let the market alone already! It will sort things out. Miners centralization is fud. It has nothing to do with block size.

In 10 years, it may cost a billion, and again, the harm will be minimal and can be easily mitigated: a malicious miner can be banned, a quick patch can be installed to reject larger blocks. You assume for some reason that in case of a serious attack we will just sit and do nothing. 
It's a theoretically possible scenario, but its benefit for the attacker is always negligible compared to the cost, so its probability is very very low.  You're suggesting to potentially sacrifice growth of Bitcoin, which is vital for its survival and success, for the sake of preventing one case of an unrealistic and easily recoverable attack.

There's no such thing as artificially low. Fees are low today because miners are fine with them, they decide their own block sizes and fees. When it will cost money in future, then they will raise the fees. Let the market work, it will sort things out. Bitcoin is all about market. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:50:47


Not correct. Just by "enabling" to use transactions, by increasing the limit you do not lose nodes. But if running a node actually becomes harder, it means there are many new users in the system. Which means there will be more nodes and more miners despite being harder to run them - because 2% of 1mln users is more than 10% of 100k.
Again: increasing the limit does not increase block size. And when it does, it brings more decentralization, not less.

If backlog develops, then the price is too low. 
Even if McDonalds posts "minimum hamburger price is 0.005 USD", a buyer that pays 0.010 USD may stay forever, as long as persistent queue develops. Solution - raise the price high enough to eliminate the queue (to $1). The higher the price =&gt; the fewer customers there are. 
If there's high demand, it's better to sell fewer items for a higher price.  
So, a price is only useless if it's too low.

Um, you got that backwards. Limiting the blocksize with the intention to keep network "healthy", or to raise the fees, or to develop offchain services, is wrong. Miners themselves know what fees should be and how many transactions they can handle. There can set their own limits and fees if they need. 
Offchain services are completely irrelevant to the block limit as well. I don't understand why people keep bringing them up.  No matter what offchain services or layers there are, blockchain is still needed for an unpredictable amount of transactions, far higher than 3 per second. 
 You're free to use them instead of the blockchain if they provide value, so they should be created only if people want them, not because they are pushed to them by fees.

Without growth there won't be deflation and stabilization. Without deflation and stabilization there won't be mass adoption. If you want Bitcoin only as a payment mechanism, then PayPal is for you, not for me. Because as merely a payment processor PayPal is more effective.
You've finally unequivocally expressed your intent to castrate Bitcoin so it won't be a thread to the current system.

The hypothetical "danger" of abandoning the holy random number of 1mb which has been disproven many times is nothing compared to actual real danger of hitting it; even you don't deny it which is proven by  you offering to wait for it.


Lightning or any other technology requires at least 20mb; nor lightning not anything justifies keeping the limit. If lightning in fact so good as you say, people will want to use it instead of blockchain without any limit; but if you intend to push users out of blockchain by fees and limits then it implies your other technologies are worse for the market than blockchain itself. 


What 20mb blocks? Raising the limit doesn't increase blocks. But if the demand for transactions suddenly rises by 40x, keeping the limit breaks Bitcoin or at least cripples its growth when it's needed the most.


You're assuming blocks can only grow, which is a highly optimistic assumption; tell this to Litecoin. If too many nodes are pushed out, it motivates many to run their own nodes to increase security; if there is *actual* lack of security, people will stop using Bitcoin and blocks will reduce again. Market can solve such problems better than central planners. You're suggesting to kill Bitcoin's growth when Bitcoin needs steady growth more than ever for the sake of hypothetical danger based on false mainstream economic theory that Bitcoin is intended to disprove.


Doesn't make any sense, all the reasons to refuse the increase will be the same in the times of crisis; unless crisis is what you actually want.

You're missing why Bitcoin is popular. Your assumption that Bitcoin will be popular no matter what is groundless and doesn't make sense, which is indicated by you insisting that Bitcoin can succeed with 10kb limit.
If congestion happens, it is because people want to use Bitcoin - that is correct. But the reason why they do, is because Bitcoin has been working flawlessly for them before. And after congestion occurs, Bitcoin loses its users who are unable to send money anymore.
 Now there is no congestion - because people have stopped using Bitcoin. That's your own words. What's beyond my understanding is why someone would think it's good for Bitcoin.  No people - no adoption - no value. Do you think inability to withdraw money from MtGox made people want to use it more, or the opposite?
You think payment processors will use Bitcoin then? But who are they going to process for? People have left already. You think they are coming back? What for? You think people will suddenly jump to payment processors? Some maybe, but the most will not. Why, if they didn't want them if the first place? Bitcoin is valuable because of its ability to send money without a third party, not the other way around. Without that feature Coinbase is no different from PayPal.
The network was not crowded back in 2009 - because nobody wanted it. It even could work with 10kb limit for a year. Until people would realize they can't send their money and Bitcoin doesn't work as advertised. 
We would never be able to grow to the point where we are today with 10 KB block. And we can't grow with the 1mb limit kept forever. If Bitcoin can't grow, it dies.  And there will be no decentralization if there's no users. 
1mb limit is only known as safe because we're not hitting it. Because Bitcoin is working as if there's no limit. 250kb was also safe, until it wasn't.

Price = demand/supply. The supply of BTC is constantly growing which puts a downward pressure on the price. I'd say the price is pretty stable, which shows it's supported by the growing demand. 
What you see as spam is a valuable service for others, since they willingly pay the fees. For example, mixers help users to obfuscate transactions, increasing value of Bitcoin.

"Chinese are moaning" is a stupid argument, not every person in the world can mine, and just because you're doing it now, doesn't mean the network is obligated to cover your costs till the end of your life. 




And yet nobody asks for subsidies to Americans; so don't subsidize the Chinese.
They just need to pay more for higher bandwidth, that's it, because they deliberately moved to rural places for cheaper electricity. They will have less profits, that's what they are complaining about, but nobody is obligated to provide profits for them at the expense of the network. 
The network is healthy: you're not a part of the network if you can't mine. Bitcoin  had no problems when Chinese farm didn't existed, and it will survive even if they disappear - which will not happen anyway.

That's the whole point, YOU have no clue what fees will be with what limit and how many users will be pushed out by what limit not just offchain, but out of Bitcoin altogether. "most marginal transactions". Purely subjective, you have no idea what level of transactions will be cut off. And keeping any limit forever inevitably makes most of transactions "marginal". 
You do not know how much "marginal transactions" contribute to the BTC value and to the network effect. If you think only big players ("several million") are valuable to a currency, you don't know how markets work. An average Joe can crash a currency. Millions of small players are drastically more valuable to Bitcoin than two Winklevii or Byrne or even Bill Gates.
What makes you think there will be hundreds of thousands users when you're want to deliberately kick them out of Bitcoin? How will we get to that adoption when you want to limit the adoption, by your own words? To stop "most marginal" users from using Bitcoin. 


Liquidity is ability to send money any moment you want. Without that any value is worthless. Limiting transactions is limiting liquidity. Without the Blockchain you're not sending money - you're asking someone to do that. 
You're free to use offchain solutions if you want, but not by limiting Blockchain. We have to always keep the choice. I'm not concerned about Changetip or Circle only because I have the freedom to use them or to not. Without that choice Bitcoin is no different from PayPal or Visa.

A pointless statement. There's always a way to find that out and miners will find it out because they are interested in it much more than you do, they've invested millions and will do anything to prevent losing them. 


"Non sequitur" fallacy. A "larger group" doesn't mean "fewer groups". "More ability to grow" doesn't mean "fewer groups". When a group has ability to grow and has profits, it motivates creation of many similar groups. The higher profits are, the easier for many groups is to survive. The Success of GHash motivated creation of many other pools which displaced it.


That's an emotional assertion, not an argument. A pool cannot make Bitcoin trusty, because it is controlled by their miners. Restricting profits for the whole industry can make it centralized.




The **only** reason to compete is profits. Lower cost doesn't induce competition when there are no profits. Higher cost don't discourage competition when profits are high. Licensing and patents reduce profits. Regulations reduces profits. Higher BTC price brings more profits and maximizes competition, decentralization of pools and distribution of hashing power. Artificially limiting Bitcoin utility restricts profits and make mining centralized.

"If you don't like our government, you're free to leave", but still, central planning is central planning.
It's centrally controlled even if users submit to the rule of a central authority voluntarily, as they give up the ability to individually choose block size according to their subjective circumstances; they use the centrally controlled one instead.
Central planning is doomed to fail whether market players are being forced or choose to be ruled. In fact, even communist regimes can't survive unless supported by masses, and yet centrally planned economy doesn't work. 
It's the information problem. A central agency lacks decentralized information the market possesses. Every last user sending transactions and every miner processing them decide (using all the information available to them) if the current block size is good enough to preserve the value of their coins (which is the goal of decentralization and the ultimate purpose of the whole system). Lack of security will result in reducing number of transactions and smaller blocks and vice versa.
Any attempt to calculate one size that fits all is guaranteed to be incorrect and to hurt Bitcoin's value. The 1MB limit is not even "calculated", it's just a random number that remains in place for historical reasons. 


That can't be the reason to prefer "smaller" over "larger" blocks, since it's trivial to demonstrate that 500KB blocks today are highly more preferable than 1KB blocks back in 2010. Otherwise we should limit the blocks to 1KB immediately. 
The problem is that "larger" and "smaller" are meaningless words, you can't calculate a "smaller" block size that wouldn't hurt Bitcoin. 
Again, what many are missing is that blocks are made of transactions and transactions are sent by users. "Larger" blocks come with greater number of users, which brings theoretical maximum number of miners, nodes, decentralization in general. The fact is Bitcoin today is the most decentralized cryptocurrency with the largest blocks.
Similarly, internet is more decentralized and strong today than back in 1985. Is it preferable to dictate a "small" maximum datacenter size, to avoid "centralization" of internet? Hell no, there are over 500k of datacenters on the planet today, and limiting them in size will kill most of them, which will result in greater centralization. 


A popular self-contradicting misconception. If nodes have no benefits, then how come they are valuable? It can't be both. The fact is that full nodes provide the highest level of security and the fastest verification to their owners. Users who don't benefit personally from having a node shouldn't run one, as it'd be useless (for the whole network as well) by definition. And just because some users want to limit transactions for their own benefit, doesn't mean they should be subsidized at the expense of the network. 
There's nothing new in your answer, it's just a mainstream economic fallacy "market should be regulated to avoid monopolies", but the reality is, all monopolies are products of regulation. All those arguments have been discussed and refuted here 1000 times already.

This is a theory that says "without a central authority people will start a war of all against all".  It also has been discussed numerous times already.

That's a really weird comparison. Limiting the size is essentially a wefare for "small" miners and an "anti-trust" regulation. The majority in Bitcoin are for free market, that's why we reject that bullshit. We know that freedom gives more decentralization than artificial limitis on the market. Nobody owes "small" miners nodes anything or obligated to protect them from competition. 
It's not "your" node! Nobody forced you to run it. Your node is not special, we need more nodes and miners, not "small". Artificially limiting usage and the adoption only limits decentralization.

Sorry if my comment wasn't clear. I'm not arguing against you, just trying to say in general, that the fees and growth of blocks is not an issue even if we remove the limit.
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:47:53
Fee market can always work, if the fees are lower than competition, or the utility is better than competition. 
Fee market in fact already works, people pay fees to send their transactions faster. 
Nothing needs to be forced: miners can decide for themselves when they want higher fees. They don't need them now.

I'm not assuming, it's a literal fact: your intention is to reduce the ability of users to send money. That's the utility of Bitcoin and its value - more users sending money, the network effect. Think of Bitcoin as a social network, or a messenger.
10KB blocks would create a huge entry barrier. You may hope it wouldn't repulse most of the today's userbase (that's speculation), but you can't dispute the fact that it would actively force them out. 


If you don't see the benefit in running your own node for yourself, then what are we discussing? Why are you demanding to run your node if there's no benefit? [Why do you think people run nodes?](
My point is, if centralization becomes a real danger, then your own node helps you to verify your transactions without relying on a third party. So, its value increases and more people run their nodes despite the cost. It's a self-balancing mechanism. 


You're dodging the question. How easy is easy enough? Who is going to draw the line? Based on what? What makes you think you're not mistaken? 
It's impossible logically to throw the baby by using the network. Transactions *are the baby*. If people send their own money with the network, it means it's decentralized and safe enough. The market should decide how many nodes is sufficient and how large blocks isn't too large.
@_date: 2015-06-20 09:29:54




You're right. If we give them the power to vote and to enforce a majority's decision, like in Garzik's proposal, this won't be a competitive free market anymore.
In other words, it won't be a free market if we make it non-free by imposing regulations.

@_date: 2015-06-04 17:56:47
Merely increasing the limit is not sufficient. 20mb gives time, maybe 10 years, to implement other solutions. 
But honestly I would just remove the limit right now. Yes there is a possibility that some rogue solo miner will start sending huge blocks, but his effect to the network will be as negligible as his hashrate market share, and it will cost him money, so he wouldn't be able to do that very long.
edit: To clarify, I'm not worried about mining pools, because they are controlled by their members. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:21:38
Consensus for the sake of consensus (under the rule of our wise masters) in fact makes Bitcoin centralized and kills it. 
I'm for all layers in the world - anything that has demand is useful for Bitcoin; it just doesn't mean the limit is necessary. Layers naturally take the burden off the blockchain and reduce blocks - but only if people choose them voluntarily, not because they are kicked out by fees or limits. I'm sure in future most users will use higher layers for daily expenses just out of convenience, and we don't need limits to make this happen, it already happens. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 14:16:51
Maliciously sending huge blocks just to harm competitors costs money for a sender. Then others start doing the same against you. It's the "war of everyone against all" theory: if an authority doesn't control people, they start killing each other. It doesn't work because it's not worth it, eventually you're harming yourself. 
There's a proposal to solve the propagation issue:  
Also, larger pools doesn't mean less pools. When  we have adoption, there will be more profit for miners, more miners and more pools.

That distinction doesn't really exist, it's all relative and subjective. "Bitcoin is for settlement" is a non-statement, it says nothing anything how large block size can be considered "for settlement". In fact, Bitcoin can serve as a "settlement" with any block size, it will come naturally.

Sellers are selling profits, not for "margins". Selling more for lower price maximizes profits. If a seller refuses selling more, he rejects more profits. Unusual, but possible. 
It means his **demand for money** has declined, while the supply of money (from customers) hasn't changed. So the law holds true. "Money" is a good just like any other.


If they're choosing not to pay then there's no demand. If I "demand" Tesla Model S, but don't want to pay, then there's no demand from me. "Pain" is a meaningless random term here, you either buy or not.


That is what the law says. Only market itself - supply and demand - can determine a price; any attempts to model it by a central authority will fail.

I don't know what do you mean by proportional. A cost of running a node is an investment in business of selling transactions. Is cost of running a datacenter proportional to the profits of datacenter? It contributes to the profits of the businesses and helps decentralization to flourish. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:42:29


It's _technically_ viable for Bitcoin to remain decentralized regardless of technicalities (you can technically build millions of full nodes with 1GB blocks). The argument is about whether it's **economically** viable under which conditions (my answer based on economics is yes).
EDIT: "1GB blocks" was an exaggeration for the sake of argument (it is possible to build 1mln full nodes with 1GB from the pure technical standpoint though). But I can prove why it's also economically viable: 1GB blocks assume billions of people use Bitcoin, it's 2150, BTC = at least $10mln in current prices, transaction fees are astronomical, the storage and bandwidth are insanely cheap, mobile phones have thousands of TB of storage, millions of businesses and miners run their own nodes.

Blocks are essentially unlimited so far, they mostly have been growing freely without touching the limit for the last 5 years.
When block reward diminishes, fees will probably be higher in order to fully cover miners' expenses. The full cost of an average 400KB block today (given the average transaction cost [$8]( is 6400$.

I'm scratching my head when I hear such arguments.  It's a fundamental misunderstanding of the economy. You don't control other people's intentions. 
If there's actual demand for on-chain transactions then limiting it doesn't make any good. Just because you reject the demand for blockchain with an artificial limit, it doesn't make people send money with an off chain solutions. 
It works the opposite way: you create an off chain solution and if it's really better than blockchain THEN people use it. And then you don't need any limits.  If it's not better than blockchain itself, then instead of using it people will abandon Bitcoin altogether.
 Circle can work as an off chain solution. They don't ask to keep the limit, because they know that forcing people out of blockchain will not make them using Circle. Contrary, users will just abandon Bitcoin. I'm using Circle because of blockchain, not the other way around.
Please develop any treechains or lightnings or anything. Bit keeping the limit won't help you in that. Instead it can only make Bitcoin less popular.

You think it will result in centralization? (which I don't believe, but) Even if it will, who cares? It's only temporary, there are no legal privileges for any miner or a node to remain in their positions forever, 20MB will become as small as 1MB very soon.

Miners running a multimillion business are able to launch their own node for the sake of security or ask another node for information if they're lazy. 
Nobody "increases the block size", it grows due to demand, which brings utility, price, and profits for the mining industry. Restricting its natural growth harms profits and reduces decentralization.


It's like I'm talking to a wall. If a group has 40%, then it motivates another similar group to enter the market and to cut the slice of mining profits, unless there are artificial barriers. Remember GHash? It had 40%, then other pools started their businesses, now it's 3%.

Ask yourself, do you value decentralized Bitcoin over cheap Bitcoin? If the answer is yes, then this is what keeps it decentralized. No magic here: the market is you, and me, and all of us. The only reason we've come so far, not because of 1MB limit, but because millions like you and me have supported Bitcoin inspite all of its drawbacks.

"If the number of customers is higher than the amount of seats in the theater, there's no way to choose a fee that will ensure you'll get a seat". 
Are you hearing what you're saying? Merchants control the number of customers by adjusting prices, miners control the transaction rate by adjusting fees. You're making up things, There's no magic here, it's an econ 101: if the price rises, people buy less stuff. If fee rises, people send less transactions.


If queue grows, the fee should be increased to reduce the queue. 


It is fixed at the level which ensures there will be no queue and no clogging, and the infrastructure will be able to handle the appropriate number of customers who are ready to pay 3%. If suddenly demand growth and VISA wouldn't be able to handle it, the fees will rise to 4%.

Not doing a hardfork when it's needed just because not everyone is convinced is a terrible idea.

Hard fork is dangerous, indeed, that's why we need to pass it now, when it's calm, then later, during the next boom and blocks will be hitting the limit. That is why postponing it is harmful for Bitcoin.

Nobody locks Bitcoin into anything, blocks can be 1kb regardless of limit. Do you understand the difference between block size and block size limit? Look, altcoins have [empty blocks]( despite similar limits.
Because, from all your rant, it seems you assume 8GB limit means 8GB blocks sent every 10 minutes.


Then people will stop sending money, and blocks will reduce. Do you realize that blocks are made of transactions and transactions are sent by users? That blocks grow because more people send more transactions? That they do because they feel Bitcoin is safe? That they stop sending if Bitcoin isn't safe?


Technological boons are irrelevant. Natural technological and social limitations will limit the block size naturally, miners can set their own soft limits if they can't or don't want to handle large blocks, people can send more or fewer transactions, if they don't see Bitcoin as safe enough because of big blocks.


This argument contradicts itself. By that logic, you can't predict attacks and other dangers possible with keeping 1MB limit.


Nonsense! If demand surges, then blocks shrink. Remember, **blocks are made of transactions, transactions are sent by users**. Less demand = smaller blocks, higher demand = bigger blocks.  That's why it's dangerous to squeeze it into the artificial limit set 5 years ago, when blocks were only 300 bytes large.

Of course it is. It penalizes miners for blocks of perfectly valid transactions above some centrally planned size T.

That is not true. We hear this every day. "If all people in the world will use the blockchain, then it will become a failure!" Even your "accidentally broken" link says "blocks hundreds of megabytes in size" (i.e. billions of people send thousands of transactions) will destroy Bitcoin. 
Which is a nonsense on its face of course (because *that* rate of usage implies it is perfectly safe and decentralized), but that's what the argument is. 


It's an absolutely market decision. The engineers who actually determine the supported capacity are the miners who process transactions, i.e. the market itself. The individuals who decide more or fewer transactions to send (because of Bitcoin being more or less safe), are ordinary users, i.e. the market itself. It has nothing to do with central planners desperately trying to calculate the magical number of the perfect block size.

What insane policy? Miners can have whatever policy they want. They can reject all lower-fee transactions, like they already do with feeless spam.

It still harms Bitcoin growth, just not as badly as a fixed limit. Penalty for higher number of legitimate transactions is a welfare for "smaller" miners. It never works in real world, it will only reduce the utility and value of Bitcoin.
If we're aiming at artificially keeping miners small, we'll only achieve less usage and less miners than we would have without restrictions.
@_date: 2015-06-09 07:04:42


Raising the limit doesn't raise the block size; blocks grow due to the growth in demand. Skyrocketing demand for transactions implies security is sufficient in the eyes of the market. Higher adoption brings more decentralization and security. Bitcoin is much more secure now than 5yr ago with 1kb blocks. Rejecting the demand cripples Bitcoin's utility and value and prevents further decentralization and endangers its growth when it's needed the most.

Miners are nodes who get paid, but they also do the hard work of finding new coins (much harder than just running a node), metaphorically they are digging the gold out of the ground. It's an interesting question if it's possible to have a system without miners, but then it's not clear how do you distribute new coins in such system and still keep it decentralized.

That's the whole point, YOU have no clue what fees will be with what limit and how many users will be pushed out by what limit not just offchain, but out of Bitcoin altogether. "most marginal transactions". Purely subjective, you have no idea what level of transactions will be cut off. And keeping any limit forever inevitably makes most of transactions "marginal". 
You do not know how much "marginal transactions" contribute to the BTC value and to the network effect. If you think only big players ("several million") are valuable to a currency, you don't know how markets work. An average Joe can crash a currency. Millions of small players are drastically more valuable to Bitcoin than two Winklevii or Byrne or even Bill Gates.
What makes you think there will be hundreds of thousands users when you're want to deliberately kick them out of Bitcoin? How will we get to that adoption when you want to limit the adoption, by your own words? To stop "most marginal" users from using Bitcoin. 


Liquidity is ability to send money any moment you want. Without that any value is worthless. Limiting transactions is limiting liquidity. Without the Blockchain you're not sending money - you're asking someone to do that. 
You're free to use offchain solutions if you want, but not by limiting Blockchain. We have to always keep the choice. I'm not concerned about Changetip or Circle only because I have the freedom to use them or to not. Without that choice Bitcoin is no different from PayPal or Visa. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 10:58:45


There's already a fee market, we pay higher fees for faster confirmation and miners reject dust transactions. Higher fees already get priority. The fees are minimal compared to block reward, but only because block reward is sufficient for now.


It's not you who make a movie, miners do that. Miners are fully capable to raise the fees themselves and set their own soft limits when block reward goes away. If you "create a market" for them by limiting the amount of movies (transactions) they can sell, they wouldn't be able to maximize their revenues by selling as much as needed.

Obviously, to have the same security as in 2013, we should set the hard limit to 100KB, like the blocks were in 2013. If we do that, 300.000 users will immediately give up their fancy wallets and will run Bitcoin-QT again. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:42:52
If we want at least 1 billion people to use Bitcoin, with 1MB limit than would mean 1 transaction in 4.5 years for a user. So, assuming 1bn users would want to use such an expensive tool, it would cost them far more than 100$. But most likely they wouldn't want it.
@_date: 2015-06-16 09:24:18
Because we don't want to face rigid obstacles in case of unexpected spike in demand. It will bring skyrocketing price and profits for miners more than enough to cover higher costs of bandwidth.

I disagree. Running a full node is motivated by pure enthusiasm. Besides, internet and storage are cheaper today than 2 years ago and blockchain isn't that bigger. Imagine if we compress blockchain to 10gb and set the hardlimit to 100kb (assuming no crash landing), there will be no new nodes. 
Because it's not the effort, but the net outcome is what counts. Enthusiasm is on decline because price is constantly declining for the lasts two years. Reducing the blockchain will not change it a bit, but will bring much harm due to risen fees.
When the price will rise again, there will be more nodes.

Bitcoin risks becoming an economical failure, replaced by less centrally regulated currencies who aren't afraid to grow.


Curious exposition.
Efficiency is subjective, since value is subjective, efficiency = value/cost. That's what keeps Bitcoin decentralized - users valuing decentralization over costs.

Those who wish to validate are compensated by the validation. You don't have to run a node if the benefit isn't worth the cost. There are other ways we already compensate nodes: we pay to businesses who run their nodes. 
Cost alone means nothing, value/cost is what important, and the increased usage of the network increases its value.

Miners don't decide the block size alone - they follow the demand from the market. Users sending transactions make blocks bigger.
Miners pay the same cost as everyone. An externality implies a common property. Blockchain is not a common property, nobody has a property rights to it, other don't have to run a node if they can't. They should decide if the (individual) benefit of running a node worth the cost of it. If it isn't, then they shouldn't run a node. If they can't use Bitcoin without a node, they shouldn't send transactions. Less people sending fewer transactions will make blocks smaller. That's how the market balances itself.

Now,  [one farmer]( tries to fight them, he wants to follow the market and sell more, but it's illegal, because the cartel has the power to mandate the limit, given to them by the government.
The situation is exactly the same, miners are farmers who sell transactions instead of raisins, and the government gave them the legal power over the market to "help" them (during the great depression, the law is still in place after 70 years).
It's actually frightening to see how people reinvent government in whatever they do. I was hoping it would be different in Bitcoin.

It's a market and not central planning, because miners can change the settings to anything they want, and some do.

We don't know how many people use or will use Bitcoin for sub $ 1txs. Higher fees don't give additional information why limit shouldn't be raised, but they  make impossible to know how many users througout the planet are prevented from using Bitcoin by fees. In my country you can buy a hamburger for a sub 1$.
I.e. artificial fees give less information than we had.
It's irrelevant how much time we have. If we have plenty of time before the network gets big, then it's safer to upgrade now while the network is still small. And if we have time today doesn't mean we still have time in a year. You can't predict the next boom.

Mining is driven by profits. Chinese have cheap electricity, but that only plays important role today because profits are reduced, because the price went down. Less profits makes it more difficult to keep running and allows to survive only the biggest ones.
If we see another boom, there will be plenty of new miners. More efficient miners doesn't mean less miners, if profits are huge the amount of new competing players entering the market will skyrocket too. The Chinese miners themselves were motivated by the 1200 bubble. 
Also I don't like the notion that Chinese miners are enemies. They are big Bitcoin believers and care about its future much more than you do, that's why they invest millions and hold serious amounts of BTC mined.

Um, baseless assertion. Please stop praising governments, I can see already that you worship them and adore central plans and regulation. Datacenters are driven by profits like any other business, how is different business model relevant here? They make profits and have costs, just like miners are paid for transactions, datacenters are paid by users for storage, and there are hundreds of thousands of datacenters, so your false theory is rejected by reality, despite you stubbornly trying to avoid facing that fact. 


And yet competition among datacenters flourishes despite high cost. And yet GHash was displaced by new competitors. Artificial entry barriers that reduce profits harm competition, such as production quotas on number of transactions sold. 


Why aren't you able to answer directly to simple question, if it's not a vague term?

The "externalites" argument, really, in Bitcoin? It's a typical central planning excuse, and it's wrong on many levels.
Bitcoin is not a "common property", nobody owns it, and miners have no obligations to other miners to keep their lives easy. If there are miners who can process a lot transactions, and there's a demand for them, then it's good for Bitcoin, and we need more such miners, and punishing for that means harming Bitcoin's utility and value.
If a miner collects fees, then he in fact brings good to the whole network. If he doesn't, then he penalizes himself by doing that.
A central planning agency cannot determine precisely what amount of transactions is wrong and should be penalized, and if it should, with what fine, so any attempt to do that will harm Bitcoin in 99 out of 100 cases. A "scientific formula" is a total bs. You can never  calculate such things correctly.
Finally, a rogue solo miner has no much power in Bitcoin, since miners work in pools and any pool, **especially** a large one, is controlled by the market. We saw what the market does to pools who misbehave, see GHash.io.

It seems people who talk about de/centralization are forgetting what those words mean and what's so good/bad about them.


That's essentially what I'm talking about. The fact that Bitcoin is decentralized means users' money can't be stolen: the limited supply prevents inflation, nobody has the power to ban users or confiscate their funds with double spend or other way. 
That's why people trust Bitcoin with their money and prefer it over PayPal, despite the drawbacks: expensive, risky, volatile, hard to obtain, no customer protection, etc. 
Bitcoin can't just become vaguely "centralized" without losing its safety. So, as long as people are using Bitcoin and trust it with their money, it's safe for them and decentralized. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:54:48
I thought it's pretty obvious that Bitcoin since its establishment up to this moment is less convenient and cheap than PayPal - and yet we're here. I guess I should explain obvious things. Ok, I can try. 


Which is my point exactly. More and more people will use Bitcoin because it's a deflationary store of value. 
Bitcoin can't remain deflationary if it becomes centralized. Because centralization allows for fractional reserve banking. Which makes it possible to print unlimited amounts of banknotes while having limited *reserves. The same thing that happened to gold. Not gold itself per se, but it was eventually replaced by banknotes issued by centralized entities.
The deflationary nature is the main weapon of Bitcoin, the hope of growing price is what attracts and will attract millions and billions. 


Only if you have no sense in economics. Mass adoption a) provides liquidity to Bitcoin which stabilizes it, and b) ensures growing demand, which eventually makes BTC deflationary.

@_date: 2015-06-05 00:58:20
The limit must be raised soon because a hard fork requires time to pass smoothly; because the fork is inevitable and it's betters be done sooner than later; because we must be ready for an unexpected growth; and there's no way to tell how soon the next boom will kick in; because when we hit the limit it will be too late. 
Nobody cares about your bandwidth; it's not about you but the network in general is what matters; if we're unable to process growing demand bitcoin may become uncompetitive; but if we succeed, there will be plenty of decentralization all over the world due to the price and the hype. 
Miners can set soft limits against spam and reject spammy transactions, as they already do.

There is already a fee market. The market has determined the fees are sufficient and the blocks are not too big to handle. Miners can set their own limits and raise the fees once they think otherwise.

The devs have been refusing to increase the limit for *years*, and many still do even here in this thread. What is actually reckless is the eager wish to break the normal work of Bitcoin the way it worked for the last five years by hitting the artificially imposed limit that was virtually non existent until recently. It's the 1mbers who are spreading the fear that if we won't hit that limit immediately, Bitcoin will centralize and die. And now you're proposing to centralize development in the hands of our wise masters for the sake of "decentralization". Sure, because it worked out so well with central banks and fiat currencies.

20x more usage is 20x more users, so the total number of nodes will be greater than today. 20MB only requires 170GB traffic per month (20MB * 6 * 24 * 2 * 30 minimum, or 0.8TB for 5 incoming connections) or 30Mbit/sec channel to download a block in 5 seconds. 
And don't forget we're talking about future, so internet will be cheaper and faster then. It's unlikely to see actual 20x growth in a year or two. 5 years if we're lucky. And it's more like 50x more since the average block size today is still 400KB.

You have zero evidence. Unlimited blocks are impossible, as long as we live in a physical world: miners have their own physical limits, so nobody will be able to keep mining without charging a fee.  
You contradict yourself by "altruistic mining". If it altruistic, it requires resources. If it requires resources, you can't mine without collecting fees. We already pay fees to miners, so I don't even know what you're talking about.

"The proposal to increase the size is reckless, dangerous and could destroy the entire infrastructure." - you're saying you "know" 1MB limit is safe, and not 1MB is reckless. That's the *direct opposite* of what I said. You don't know what is safe and what is reckless, only market knows. 
"increase the size" - You're deliberately misusing the terms. Nobody "increases the size", the MARKET increases or decreases the size of blocks by sending more or fewer transactions. For example, nobody uses Litecoin, that's why his blocks are small despite the same limit, because Litecoin isn't safe. But Bitcoin usage grows because it's safe to send more and more. 
Raising the limit removes the barrier before natural growth and allows market to find an optimal balance between decentralization and utility, between security and freedom.

It's not your business, you don't know that. Miners decide what his contribution is, they wouldn't include his transaction otherwise. They aren't stupid, they know what transactions contribute better than you, they invested millions in their business.


It's not your business, don't hold coins if you don't want others sending money. I want people sending more transactions, I know they support and expand the network simply by using it between each other, and without them the price would go to zero. 


What? Nobody forces you, you have like 500 altcoins to choose from.

Not sure if there's actual correlation here, but the number of nodes floats around ~6000 since May 1st.
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:02:19
Keeping the block limit does exactly that: it pushes users out of blockchain. Some devs hope it will push them into their own offchains. It's stupid indeed, but they literally say that. 
But it's an empty hope. If offchains were actually better, people would WANT to use them instead of the blockchain. 
Offchains can become popular because of blockchain, not the other way around. Deliberately limiting blockchain usage limits blockstream popularity and vise versa.

You shouldn't run a node if it's not good for you; as you shouldn't pay to miners if their services aren't worth the money.

Skilled in what? We don't expect that level of adoption today, but even if we do, the technology is there, and the network would be far more decentralized with 1.7 billion users, than with ~1mln.


The problem is that that offchain service must be better than the blockchain itself from a user standpoint. It's only guaranteed when user can choose it voluntarily, regardless of fees. If he kicked out from blockchain merely by fees, it implies that that higher layer is worse than the blockchain. 
If you know how to create an attractive solution for micropayments - then do it, what's the problem? People will want you. Changetip didn't ask for higher fees. I see no point in risking worsening the system. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:19:53


It's trivial to back out  - just send fewer transactions if it's not safe. 


So, Bitcoin becomes less popular and blocks shrink, and an average individual can run a node again. 


Why the whole humanity uses a cryptocurrency if it's unfree? Bitcoin usage derives from its freedom. It's a self-regulating system. More freedom, more safety, more decentralizaion, more value =&gt; more transactions, bigger blocks, less freedom =&gt; smaller blocks.

@_date: 2015-06-07 16:57:46


Bigger nodes doesn't mean fewer nodes. 1% of 100mln users is more than 50% of 100k users. More decentralization = more nodes, not "smaller nodes". We have more decentralization today than in 2009 when blockchain was tiny and blocks were 1kb.
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:23:38
A 20MB block is unlikely to happen before 5-10 years, but if it occurs tomorrow, it will be a good thing, since the wide adoption and the price will cover the downsides of bandwidth and storage consumption. 
20MB blocks of genuine transactions is 60-120 tps, a PayPal rate, it would be a success, BTC will cost $5K.
20MB every 10 minutes is 168GB per month minimum (20*2*6*24*30) (you can limit the number of incoming connections and throttle the bandwidth), it's very doable right now. But, again, we don't expect that earlier than 2025.
There's no advantage in inflating block size, since any miner who do that increases his own probability of an orphaned block, that's why miners tend to create blocks as small as possible. 
The Chinese can pay for higher bandwidth, even if they can't handle, there will be others who can (difficulty will reduce), there's no privileged players in Bitcoin, creating privileges is a direct path to centralization.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:57:18
A fullnode requiring datacenter means 
a) adoption is really huge 
b) it's probably 2050, so you can run a datacenter from your basement. 


I'm not certain about that, but what I'm certain about is that the limit is limiting people who want to use blockchain, which limits adoption. Probably it's not harmful until some point, but we do not know where this point lies. For sure, 1MB cannot be kept forever.
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:02:29


But the price was only declining almost all the time. The 1200 bubble was the biggest promotion ever since. 


ALL scalability solutions require much higher limits. And 1MB is just a magic number, so who is a fanatic here? You don't know how large blocks should be for the global adoption with any solutions. 
Why can't you understand, nobody "increases blocksize", it grows due to demand. Restricting its natural growth doesn't help scalability or decentralization at all. 
Blocks were 100kb and blockchain was 10GB in 2013, do you think we would have more or less nodes today if we would set the hard limit to 100KB in 2013? Or if blockchain today was still 10GB?
@_date: 2015-06-25 09:04:54
A stress test of 100 blocks has costed the tester $5K. If you're willing to pay $50-70 grands of fees for sending your porn (at today's prices), and miners are willing to accept them, then why not. Transactions are transactions. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:21:34

Miners can raise the fees if it becomes a real problem.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:17:38


Supply and demand. Growing demand+limited supply = rising price. Growing demand translates into growing blocks. 
If I'm wrong and BTC will NEVER rise, then Bitcoin will eventually die (no demand), and no reason to worry about big blocks or decentralization at all. 


Decentralization is a measure, not utility itself. You don't know how much decentralization is enough, only market can decide it. If the demand for transactions is growing, it means decentralization is sufficient and the value of Bitcoin is growing in the eyes of the market. Trying to cripple Bitcoin usage would only reduce its value.
More usage and more adoption will eventually attract more miners, more nodes and more decentralization. 


Why would anyone use expensive Bitcoin when there are cheap altcoins nearby? 
Retail payment networks are no different from Paypal or LibertyReserve - not that anything wrong with that, but they are easily regulated. You can't sell drugs with Coinbase account. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:16:24
To my understanding, a hard limit is essentially a universal consensus on rejecting blocks bigger than X. I have a feeling it would be healthier for the network if nodes and miners would decide that number by themselves, naturally, not because devs have changed it. 
There would be much less controversy that way.
Also, a miner invests millions in his business, so, while a spam attack from a miner is possible, it would be an extraordinary event, and it could be reverted by special case actions taken by the whole network. 
Another point, without a strict hard limit miners could possibly start adjusting their own soft limits to prevent spam, that would help to develop the fee market. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:47:00
There's no Chinese cartel, Chinese pools do not control their miners; miners control their pools, they can abandon the pool overnight if it threatens Bitcoin and endangers their profits.

I see a contradiction here.
@_date: 2015-06-20 09:55:56
Miners are full nodes, they need at least one node per pool to mine. Blockchain is still small today, so space and bandwidth isn't an issue yet. Miners will charge higher fees when block reward diminishes, or the size of the blockchain will become a real problem that affects the growth of the network and the price of BTC. 
Full nodes mostly benefit themselves, so they should only be paid if others are willing to pay them. We already pay to nodes who serve to users: it's the nodes held by Bitcoin-related businesses, such as wallets or merchants or payment processors. 
The beauty of the market is that it solves such issues better than central planners.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:32:16


A fee market works already, the market has decided the current level of fees is sufficient.


We're talking about the situation in future when the space isn't available anymore because block reward doesn't cover the costs of hashing/sending/storing anymore. 


They can't include every transaction if fees don't cover the cost, everything has cost, hashing, storing, sending, we live in a physical world with physical limitations. You're assuming miners have infinite resources, which is nonsense. Even if it were true, then fees *should have* been near zero.


Repeating isn't proving. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:22:12


This is incorrect, a full node is not an "industry": it's a pure enthusiasm (unless you're miner). Second, it's not about percentage, but the total number of nodes. As the userbase growth, more and more new users want to run a node. For those reasons, reducing the block and the blockchain size, will not increase total number of nodes. Contrarily, risen fees will discourage new users from entering the market. 


Another popular misconception. Human activity is not motivated by costs, but **by profits** - be it financial profits or moral satisfaction. Growing demand combined with limited supply will eventually translate into moonrocketing price, which will motivate new businesses, miners, enthusiasts to run thousands new nodes, like it was in 2013. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:16:28
"Spam" is subjective; fees are required to reduce the number of transactions in general due to inability of miners to handle them, because of bandwidth/storage/hashpower costs. Today it's used for spam only because block reward pays for everything; it will change when reward won't be sufficient anymore.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:18:41


My point exactly, if he doesn't reduce the price, he prefers to lose money, i.e. his demand for money decreased. 
But he can't do it forever, he'll eventually has to make profits, and the price will decrease because of increased supply.


The precondition was "supply has increased", and you said "it is on the shelves". If he reduces production then it's a different case, supply has decreased and he'll have to increase price, unless he doesn't want profits. 


A price is a part of the product. Just because there's demand at one price doesn't mean there's demand at any price. I'd buy an iPhone for $500, but it's useless for me for $5000.

The network can handle spam with 20mb blocks today easier than with 1mb blocks 5 years ago.

No it won't. Increasing the limit will not cause blocks to grow. 
But when we'll see the growing blocks, miners will have much more profits due to the raised BTC price.


Which would decrease difficulty and make mining profitable again.


Which is why 20MB is needed to buy some time. And why the limit should be gradually raised after 20MB.

Arithmetic can't be refuted by history. 1% of 20mln is greater than 5% of 1mln. 
The history you're talking about is in the past Bitcoin couldn't be used without a full node, which has changed eventually and affected the number of users running it. Reducing the blocks today back to 100KB won't increase the number of full nodes.

So why can't Chinese do that to prevent blocks from growing? 
51% can't prevent new players from entering the market so that they would lose their 51% share. Also, by attacking a minority they endanger their own profits, I mean, transactions aren't coming through, the network utility reduces. 
But now with the power to decide the block size, it's easier to freeze the status quo legally without obvious consequences.
 My only hope is that Bitcoin itself is not a monopoly and miners will subject to competition from other cryptos, but even though, the network turns from a dynamic floating system where no big player is safe into a rigid cartel.

That's only because so far the supply grows faster than adoption.
edit: wasn't my argument clear? The price is declining. Price = demand / supply. So far the BTC supply grows faster than the demand, so price is declining. Growing in demand translates into bigger blocks. Supply is limited. Eventually the price will jump which will lead to higher number of nodes and miners.

Miners can set soft limits any moment if they want to see that. Hard limit doesn't give an option to raise it quickly in case of emergency. 


All solutions require much bigger blocks, no solution justifies keeping an artificial limit, especially that low (130MB is needed for LN), nobody knows how large blocks should be for what solution at what moment of time (don't forget progress never stops).


60-120 tps is the PayPal rate. I'd prefer much higher limit, but 20MB is large enough to handle serious spike in demand and gives plenty of time. 




Higher limit doesn't make blocks bigger. They unlikely to become 20MB before 10 years from now, when internet will be faster and storage is cheaper. Even if wide adoption happens sooner, it will imply the network is safe enough for people to trust it, and will ensure wider decentralization due to more users, miners, and businesses using Bitcoin. 


What? No, adoption and growth encourages new solutions. Would we have many wallets and solutions if the block size was set to 10KB back in 2010? No, because nobody would be interested in Bitcoin due to inability to send money with it. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:32:51


Just because you can imagine a hypothetical unicorn doesn't mean it can be real. As a niche product Bitcoin won't survive, its fixed unregulated supply was meant for growth only.


You call a deflationary currency a "pyramid scheme", another curious exposition from you, it explains a lot. You clearly have nothing to do with Bitcoin and its goals. 
Without growth Bitcoin can't achieve mass adoption, without mass adoption, there's not enough liquidity, without liquidity there's no stability. 
In just transacting money PayPal is miles more stable, fast, secure, and efficient, and wins competition. You may also think Satoshi is completely silly, for saying "in 20 years there either will be very large volune, or no volume at all", he understood how economics works. 


No, but internet is. Banking system is centralized because it's regulated, not because it's "expensive". And it was very decentralized until 1913 by the way. You can't regulate internet, internet regulates you, see the Arab spring and twitter revolutions. You clearly prefer internet of 1985 over 2015, but the latter is infinitely more decentralized. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:20:13


It's not "possibility to scale", it's the inevitable prerequisite for any scalability solutions. Also, nobody "increases block size", raising the limit simply allows it to grow, it doesn't mean blocks will become 20MB immediatelly, and it doesn't even guarantee they will grow, it's a very optimistic assumption that people will always keep sending more and more transactions. 




"Network health" is subjective, nobody can calculate it but the market itself. What you don't understand is "decentralization" is a measure, not a goal. You can't know how much decentralization is healthy, but we do know that 100% decentralization is redundant. 
Only users themselves know if the network is secure enough. If people use Bitcoin and send money - then the network is health and safe, because the market has decided so. If blocks are growing - it because users send more and more transactions, it means the degree of decentralization is sufficient. If security is in danger - people will use Bitcoin less, and blocks will become smaller again. 


Nobody "pushes blocks size", why people keep repeating that nonsense? Adoption pushes block size, limit simply allows adoption to grow naturally. If you cripple the utility of Bitcoin without any need, you're only harming it and its value.

It's all subjective. Low, high, healthy. What is low and what is healthy should be decided by the market, not by developers imposing random limits in front of growing demand. The market knows what is healthy. Letting the market grow by itself isn't emphasizing on low fees, miners know what fees should be. If Bitcoin grows in usage and adoption, it implies it's healthy enough in the eyes of the market.

But it's up to miners to decide, can they process, validate, and store those transactions or not, and whether the payment is sufficient. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:03:44
You're missing the point. Of course it's not feasible for every last consumer.The point is that imposing artificial limits will not change it, will not help decentralization and will not cause more nodes to appear.
If we kept blocks at 100kb since 2013 via hard limit, we would have even less full nodes today, because high fees would kick new users out and would kill growth in adoption.

And? They eventually will be. 




That's the reason for a 100KB limit? You're seriously arguing we'd have **more** full nodes today with 100KB?? Let's make it 10KB, we'll be even more decentralized by that logic? 


You've got it backwards, increase in block size is *caused* by higher usage of Bitcoin ([Litecoin]( blocks don't grow despite the 1MB limit, because nobody uses it), which eventually translates into higher price (which is why BTC &gt; LTC), higher profits, and higher decentralization (which is why BTC mining is more decentralized than LTC). Artificially capping Bitcoin usage reduces Bitcoin value, price, and prevents decentralization. 


I though it's obvious that mining profits are different all the time, are you denying the reality? Mining has less profits now than in 2013, despite the equilibrium system, because price was higher than. But the profits today are as high as possible today. If we restrict transactions to 100KB today, mining will have EVEN LESS profits and will become even more centralized. The goal is to MAXIMIZE decentralization, which is only achievable by MAXIMIZING profits and not restricting them artificially. 


He can, if you restrict miners' profits by artificially capping Bitcoin usage.


You completely ignored there can be many persons at scale, as long as profits aren't restricted artificially.


You completely ignored that restricting transactions will not cause more miners to appear, instead it'll restrict usage, profits, will kick out smaller miners, will benefit the biggest ones, and will make mining even more centralized. 
But if profits are high, another 100 groups of the same size will enter the market and will keep it decentralized.

There is only one case when blocks aren't filled with valid transactions: miners. But it has been also discussed numerous times. Miners aren't motivated in inflating their blocks because they risk orphaning them which results in losing the block reward. The evidence shows miners keep their blocks as small as possible.
An attack from a miner is also possible, but very unlikely, since it's expensive (mining equipment costs millions) and the harm is minimal (you can send a block or two, then what?) and easily recoverable. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 10:39:44

What does it have to do with an artificial hard limit? The hard limit restricts the transactions that the system *can* and *want* to handle.


Everyone, the argument is exactly like this. It is working, but it is "centralized". Like, there are only 3 nodes in the world and they are controlled by government. (How? The government can't even take the drugs out of prisons).


How can it not work, when people actively use it, sending 100 megabytes of transactions every ten minutes? If it doesn't work, then people don't send and the blocks are empty. If it works, then people value it and use it. There's no way it can work and be broken at the same way, it's a logical contradiction. 


The market can't bypass it is the very reason why the limit is useless. Miners can set their own limits if there are too many transactions to handle. How can it be not understandable? I am so confused by your confusion.

If it's vital for them, nothing stops them from running a node. Or other nodes can provide them with an information to audit. Market will find a way, there are ALWAYS ways, especially when stakes are high, and the stakes are high for miners who invested millions. You're assuming miners are stupid and don't care about their money. 


You're not listening. "Smaller" or "bigger" is irrelevant. Bigger groups doesn't mean "fewer groups". You can have A LOT of large groups. Both pools and individual miners who can join one pool or another. 
The way to maximize the number of competing groups is to not impose artificial restrictions on growth. Any restrictions will not improve decentralization, but will do the opposite due to reduced profits. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 08:57:48


Of course he was, he paid for them. 


Actually it does (more transactions to process requires more resources), but that's irrelevant to the discussion, since the average cost for users always exist regardless of number transactions, it's simple arithmetic. Repeat after me: the average cost for users is revenue divided by number of transactions. 


Not in the case when transactions are paid with inflation.

@_date: 2015-06-12 23:40:42


And why it means higher centralization for Bitcoin? It doesn't seem obvious to me. For example, just because YouTube requires 10x more bandwidth than 10 years ago, you think less people watch it today?  Do you think less people play GTA5 because it requires like 100x more resources than GTA3? Unless by "centralization" you mean something else. 


Wait, 20mb block size or the limit? Doesn't make sense either way. How can a limit push anyone off, when it doesn't change the actual block size today? Or, how can a future block size push anyone off today, when we're lucky if we reach that size in 5 years? Your assumption seems baseless.
@_date: 2015-06-09 07:28:12


I'm sorry for your ISP. But we still can handle it if it happens. You're suggesting rejecting a significant (20x) spike in demand for Bitcoin in future because of your ISP today.


Averages blocks are 0.4mb, miners voluntarily limit themselves to 0.75, what reality are you talking about? Hitting the limit in case of growing demand for transactions implies the actual reality of missed opportunity for wide adoption.
@_date: 2015-06-07 14:05:35

It's pretty binary - less people using Bitcoin vs more people. Less people is less adoption, less value, less decentralization, and vice versa - more is more. Users is the most valuable asset for Bitcoin. Without users Bitcoin is useless. 
I'm sure restricting Bitcoin usage does not create any value. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:01:50
The argument (in the link) is literally "if everyone in the world will be using Bitcoin, it will become a failure". Which is a contradiction on its face. Even core devs still miss the fact that blocks are made of transactions and transactions are sent by users. If millions and billions of users send megabytes and gigabytes of transactions every 10 minutes, they do because Bitcoin is a huge success and is perfectly safe for people; if it isn't, they will stop sending money and blocks will shrink. If we look at [altcoins]( their blocks aren't growing - they are empty and flat despite having similar or higher limits, because nobody uses them. Big blocks (actual average block size, not the limit) and Bitcoin failure are mutually exclusive.  
Also, the argument about dangers of a hard fork is pointless. We can't avoid a fork, unless the author wants to stay with 1mb forever, which would be a pure insanity. So, a fork is required sooner or later. Postponing it is no different from procrastination: it only gets more and more dangerous, as the network grows bigger and the next boom is approaching. So, it's preferable to fork now and stop worrying about forks in future.

If a miner sends spammy blocks that he doesn't collect fees for, then he already punishes himself. This approach disincentives processing legitimate transactions from users. Bitcoin will become more centralized if its natural growth gets crippled by any artificial limits.

A higher bandwidth just for the sake of harming competitors costs money. If it doesn't cost much then you're not harming anyone. If it costs much, you're harming yourself. I just don't see how this tactic can work. We have plenty of pools today, and all of them can afford thick internet channels. The propagation was more of an issue back in the times of solo mining.
If the blocks are filled with real legitimate transactions then we have growing adoption and need more pools who are able to process them. If there will be no transactions, no worry about big blocks. 
LN still requires bigger blocks.
The evidence is that 1mb will be filled up in a year or two.

"Miners can choose fees they want" doesn't mean "every single miner can choose whatever fee he wants". The mining market as a whole will find equilibrium fees, just like the fast food industry finds a minimum hamburger price and stays highly competitive and profitable without colluding into a violent cartel. 
If you believe that Uber forces drivers to work for free and to starve because there are no hard limits on amount of drivers allowed to work on the market (the same idea essentially), then you shouldn't talk about economics. 
Maybe people also shouldn't be allowed to issue their own currencies? Without limits, they will have no profits, because prices will fall to zero, so we need a central bank, right?


Define "spam". If *users* send 1GB of *transactions*, and willingly pay tens of thousands $ of fees for them, then it's obviously valuable for users and for miners. What is valuable for users and for miners is valuable for the network. Everything else is meaningless blabbering. 
If it will become too cheap for everyone to send 1GB of transactions, then costs of processing them will rise, and miners will raise their fees. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:04:33
There are no consensus now. Nothing will change if we approach the limit, things probably get worse. Agreeing that blocks can increase, agreeing to raise the limit in future, while refusing to do that in anticipation doesn't make any sense. It's just illogical.  The alleged "downsides" of a higher limit won't change just because blocks got bigger. Postponing gains nothing.
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:08:13


To prevent sending transactions is to restrict usage. "Spam" is subjective, it's just numerous small transactions, too many to handle. 
Higher fees are inevitable indeed, but only when we approach natural limits of technology available at the moment, when miners themselves decide they can't handle more transactions, then they will set their own fees and their own limits. It's impossible to predict where that limit lays and where will be in 10 years; besides, that limit is always floating.

Weird question. What makes you think that there is some magical number that we need to hit? Any scalability solution requires higher limit, only market itself will know the limit where to stop. If there's demand on market for 40x more transactions, and miners will be ready to process them, then crippling that demand harms Bitcoin's utility and value; but if the blocks are to large, miners can say their own limits and fees.
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:57:34

@_date: 2015-06-09 11:08:26


There's no forceful increase. Increasing the limit will not make blocks bigger. The 1MB limit has been in place for the last 5 years, it didn't affect any running nodes at all. The increase is planned on 2016, not now. Decentralization comes from adoption adoption comes from usage, not from limits. 


The nodes declining has nothing to do with the block limit. Increasing the limit will not suddenly make all blocks 20MB. If there's no crisis, then it safe to upgrade now. Advocating for hardfork during a crisis is **literally asking for a crisis** and much more dangerous than today when it's calm. 
Actual number of running full nodes doesn't reflect decentralization, by the way. Many people can run full nodes but don't see it as necessary, because Bitcoin is perfectly safe at the moment. What you suggest is to forcefully "decentralize" Bitcoin without actual reason by crippling its utility, which will prevent actual decentralization.


Raising the limit exactly gives more time for another solutions. It's also the first necessary and *unavoidable* step for all other solutions.


Increasing the limit doesn't affect bandwidth requirements. But rejecting the demand for transactions reduces the number of new nodes and miners that would appear due to spike in adoption and price.


"If it turns out", really? If it turns out that blocks will never ever grow up to 1MB, then we can consider it dead already. If we don't anticipate growth in demand, then everything is useless. But if we do, then postponing hardfork to the times of crisis doesn't make any sense.

No, to whatever size he can. Nobody except the market has the power over blockchain, pools are controlled by miners who can abandon a pool if it harms Bitcoin, miners are controlled by users who buy coins; miners and pools can't survive without following the market. 
Now, an insane miner with a lots of resources to destroy Bitcoin who doesn't care about profits (government) is theoretically possible, but it'd be an extraordinary case, easy to localize and ban by collective action of the whole network. A hard limit may be useful for such cases, but it needs to be far higher than the actual size of the blocks; 1mb was set when blocks were 300b large and internet was much slower.

Too long... I just want to address a few points. You keep conflating "block size increase" with "moore's law", while those two are mainly unrelated. Please, for the love of God, stop confusing BLOCK SIZE with BLOCK SIZE LIMIT. Seriously, wtf? It was explained like 1000 times already. 
The actual average block size isn't affected by the limit increase per se. Natural limits of technology at any given moment keep blocks properly small: miners can mine blocks as small as they need, according to the current state of technological progress available to them. 
Furthermore, the very notion of ever exploding blocks, which nearly everyone seems to accept as a self-evident fact (both pro- and con- sides), is merely an assumption almost as optimistic as constantly exponentially growing BTC price. A higher limit merely ALLOWS blocks to grow, not guarantees the growth. 
Think of Bitcoin as a social network, or a messenger, and the number of transactions per second is the usage rate. Bitcoin is a distributed business owned by nobody, and its usage rate growth reflects the success of the business. It may explode exponentially in some year, or it can grow 10% another year, or even decline, if things aren't going well. Look at [altcoins]( their blocks are empty and flat. Also notice BTC blocks were shrinking for a 3 months in April 2013. 
Will we have 8GB blocks by 2034? I hope so, but only if Bitcoin becomes a huge global success and will change the scope of world's politics and economics, and for now, we're really far from it. It's quite possible that by 2034 the blocks will only be 500MB large.


Those arguments were also addressed over 9000 times. In short, miners tend to keep blocks small as possible, they risk orphaning their own blocks by inflating them. 


It's really pointless, unless you want to keep blocks at 1MB FOREVER. A hardfork is inevitable sooner or later, so postponing it is similar to procrastination: as time passes, network gets bigger, we're potentially approaching the next bubble, the fork only gets more and more dangerous. So.. what's the wait for?


Again, the amount of micro/macro-transactions made on/off-chain is unrelated to the block limit debate. A hardlimit isn't needed to keep microtransactions off-chain. All you need to do is to create a viable attractive higher-layer solution for everyday's use and people will use it instead of blockchain. Look at Changetip: they didn't ask to raise the fees or keep the limit. Almost every wallet that controls your keeps can send transactions without touching the blockchain. And most users will probably use one of them in future, out of convenience. 
Moreover, trying to squeeze transactions into a planned hardlimit would be harmful, since it's impossible to predict how large blocks should be at what moment of time in future, with or without a higher layer. The idea "let's set a limit, and people will create higher layers" is wrong. It works the other way: "people will create higher layers, and blocks will reduce naturally".

I don't. All the transactions that people want to put on the blockchain need to be on the blockchain. All the other transactions they don't need will be made off-chain. It should come natural, because it's impossible to predict the required rate of needed on/off chain transactions at any given moment of time in future. Absolutely for sure, that rate far higher than 3 per second.

Are we talking about the same reality? Look out of the window - there's wide range of products of any price and quality, and the cheapest ones aren't selling best. Nokia was the market leader and now makes the cheapest phones, it doesn't help. Cheapest cars of the lowest quality are russian LADA - they don't sell well.
What you call "bottom" is the market equilibrium. Consumers are racing to the top - they want more product and more quality for their money. 


But that's only your personal opinion, others like new fresh things, and most people can't afford luxury products. Just because you "want" shoes for life, doesn't mean you'd pay $1000 for them. But if there's demand for high quality stuff - it's an opportunity for a manufacturer to make profits.

This data doesn't support it. Otherwise it would also prove that 100KB or 10KB or 1KB hard limit is a good thing. 
The link merely makes a trivial observation: *if* and *when* blocks get bigger, costs *may* increase. But it's a non sequitur fallacy: just because bigger blocks can have downsides, it doesn't prove that the 1MB hard limit is something we should hit right now.
It ignores the cost of imposed hard limit, it ignores the underlying reason why blocks grow and the harm of artificially preventing it, it confuses "raising limit" with "increasing blocks size", it falsely assumes higher limit will make blocks bigger *right now*, it focuses on costs and assumes profits never grow, it falsely assumes constant bandwidth that never gets cheaper.

It's a Bitcoin plus another failed alt-coin. What is Bitcoin with a wrong consensus? It's one failed alt-coin. 
It's a meaningless discussion, since nobody can magically make a consensus out of controversy (apparently you believe otherwise?), trying to enforce a consensus where it doesn't exist will only harm Bitcoin; luckily, there's no government and nobody can enforce it. Do what you want, it's irrelevant, you have no power here.


Sure, the same way the 1MB limit has led to centralization and killed bitcoin in 2010. Do you realize 1MB was just as high back then, as 20MB will be in a few years? Do you want to keep 1MB forever? That's pure insanity. Just nothing of that makes any rational logical sense, pure fanatism and blind addiction to random numbers.
It has been discussed and refuted 1000 times, it's an economical fallacy based on mainstream economics which Bitcoin is intended to disprove. You're just not listening to any arguments.

Going out of business means you have no wealth anymore. If you believe wealth is power, then it logically proves than no wealth is no power. So, since wealth itself doesn't guarantees you stay wealthy, which means wealth itself isn't power.

Because I can't read your thoughts and have no idea know what do you imply by your vague terms? A cost of running a node is an investment in business of selling transactions. Is cost of running a datacenter proportional to the profits of datacenter? It contributes to the profits of the businesses and helps decentralization to flourish. 
The same way growing cost of blockchain after 2013 helped new competitive miners to enter the market to make profits and replace the largest GHash.io.

VISA doesn't process 56000 transactions per second, it's just a capacity, ["that’s greater than four times the actual peak transaction rate of last year"]( so, 14000 is the actual peak.

I know many things though. I know that miners profits are highest when BTC is highest. That BTC price = growing demand/limited supply. Demand grows when BTC utility grows. BTC utility is people sending money to each other. Blocks are made of transactions. A hard limit on blocks is a hard limit on Bitcoin utility. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 13:17:21


They are attacking themselves and lose against other players who still use smaller blocks; this is why all pools tend to create blocks small as possible.


Pools have no power, miners give them power and can take it back any moment; 
Similarly, miners have no power, users give them power by valuing the coins they mine, and users can give that power back any moment if Bitcoin is in danger.

Fees have nothing to do with the decision to raise the limit. Any increase in fees is undesirable, as they are mostly useless for now, so higher fees can only harm the network. 


What?? They clearly expressed the opposite intention: if the demand rises, say, above 8MB, they want to ignore and restrict it. They vote based on their intent to protect their market share. BIP100 gives privileges to the miners who are already the largest. As a measure for "decentralizaion" it's a pure insanity.
@_date: 2015-06-07 11:05:17
That is a common misconception. Miners do not need to run a full node, only pools do. And it's very decentralized and safe to have 100mln miners competing for block reward all over the planet with even 100 pools. 
Because trying to control a pool gains nothing: miners immediately leave it if it misbehave. And if global adoption happens tomorrow and Bitcoin costs $1mln, there will be thousands  and tens of thousands of datacenters even tomorrow. 
But the adoption likely will happen in 20 years, when you can run a datacenter from your basement. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:16:40
Because the price is declining. And the price is declining because adoption is growing slower than the BTC supply. There are too many bitcoins in circulation, and we're still recovering from a bubble. 
That's only temporary, because growth of supply is strictly limited.

It's really frightening that you don't see how this isn't an argument for rejecting the demand WHEN people in fact do want to send money on the blockchain in the absence of any better solutions. A spike in transactions IMPLIES that blockchain is the best option AT THE MOMENT,  and rejecting it only harms Bitcoin without bringing any good.
Also, ALL off chain solutions still require a huge increase in the limit.
@_date: 2015-06-15 09:01:33
Maybe I haven't articulated that, but the post is about cost vs benefit. If the net benefit isn't worth running a node, but you still use Bitcoin, then it's secure enough for you. The level of security needed for the network is the level of security needed for its users. Even if most users aren't tech savvy, there are plenty who are and who care about their money, and they either add more nodes if they can, or (if security is low but running a node isn't feasible anymore) they send price signals to the whole network. The price reflects all the information about security of Bitcoin, and if there's any danger, everyone will know it. 
You're right about ports, I've overlooked the fact that you can run a node without contributing to the network. I don't think it's a real problem though - the added cost of accepting incoming connections isn't high compared to the burden of launching the node, and you do that just because you know others do the same for you, besides the number of incoming connections can be limited. Even if you close your port deliberately, you can open them any moment in case the network is in danger.

Pools require a full node. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:07:04


100Mbit = 1 block downloaded in 50 seconds. Google Fiber = 1 block in 5 seconds. As I said, not easy, but doable even today. Don't forget, we're talking about an extreme case: VISA volumes *right now*. Taking things more realistically, in 10 or 20 years 600MB blocks will be nothing. 


What does it have to do with you? Bitcoin can work even despite some folks have only GPRS or no internet at all. 


It does give profits to nodes held by mining pools, wallets, payment processors, and individuals who need individual security for their own stashes of coins. With 1.7 billion users, there will be plenty of decentralization, nobody will be able to centralize control over the blockchain. 99% of users will never run a node - they don't need it, with or without lightning, regardless of block size. 
"Every user running a node" never was a plan, so I don't even know what are you talking about.


Measuring number of users is pointless, we never know how many users there are, and even if we do, the fact is blocks are already approaching 1MB. 
If implementing LN will make users send money over LN instead of blockchain - please do it, and if you'll succeed, then there's no point in keeping the 1MB limit.


You don't know that, no point in risking. A hardfork taking weeks during the next boom, when the network is bigger, is a terrible idea. Admitting a spike is possible and the hardfork is inevitable, and refusing to perform it in anticipation, when it's calm and safe, is illogical. Postponing gains nothing.
When the 1MB was set, actual blocks were 300 bytes large, 1MB gave us 5 years. Nobody was saying "let's set 10KB limit, we can change it every year with a fork, no big deal". Why? Why??
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:56:34
The thing about small increase, is that if we really have a huge Bitcoin boom tomorrow, then an attempt to squeeze it into smallish blocks can possibly destroy it due to inability to fulfill the demand or high fees.
If they's no urgency then there's no worry that the blocks grow big, because raising the limit itself doesn't cause users to send more transactions. 
But if the demand grows big when we don't expect, we may have a problem, because a hard fork takes time to go safe.
And even the actual full 20 mb blocks is only 170gb per month. Given the pruning will be implemented as intended, we can safely go with 100mb right now.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:13:35
Why? Miners can set the limit themselves and reject free transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:06:38


The cost is in bandwidth. The idea of the attack is that smaller miners can't afford expensive bandwidth, which results in orphaned blocks due to propagation delay. If it's *that* expensive, then it hurts the attacker too, it's an unnecessary expense. It's similar to running a war against a competing merchant, it's resourceful and damaging to both. 
If we imagine the attack is successful, then it opens the floodgate of the same attacks against the attacker, so it's a no-win scenario again. 
If users aren't quitting and the price isn't declining, then it implies Bitcoin is safe. The market is the measure of Bitcoin' value, which includes security. There's no way why this scenario can work or harm Bitcoin. 


Miners know what fees are reasonable. Today's fees are reasonable, which is why miners accept almost all transactions, we pay them via inflation. When the block reward goes away, they can raise the fees themselves. 


You're repeating this again, why? Because of bandwidth and storage? It's not a reason for centralization, as I already explained, even today there are about 500000 of datacenters throughout the planet, and we don't expect that level of adoption (tens of thousands of tps) earlier than in 20 years. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 09:24:50


It's impossible to calculate that line without making a mistake. The market should decide it. Miners know their capabilities to process transactions, users know their needs and preferences (on chain vs offchain), it's the supply and demand. Market finds the best equilibrium.

Now you're just playing with words. You technically can send money if the fees are higher than the amount being sent, but financially you can't. There were people who could, who contributed to the value, and now they can't. That's what happens after congestion. They do not pay higher price, they just stop using Bitcoin - you said that.
1mb kept forever means 99% users can't send money. You're just limiting the user base. Artificial limits do not cause innovation! Mass adoption does. 
 Transferring value is the very idea of Bitcoin or any money. It doesn't matter if you send BTC every day, what matters if you can or not send them any moment. If you don't control your money, you don't own them, they have no value for you. That's the idea that hasn't changed since 2009, but it will change if the limit will remain in place forever.

I don't know what are you talking about. It's been said numerous times that a higher limit doesn't make blocks bigger, but only allows them keep growing naturally without artificial restrictions. Finally you understand it? 
And that all the "innovative higher layers" require much higher limit as well, so keeping 1MB is absolutely pointless.

Fees can't just drop, Bitcoin isn't magical: mining, storing, processing transaction costs money regardless of a hardlimit. Fees are only low today because we pay to miners with the block reward, they will likely to rise in future when the reward diminishes. 
The real average cost of a transaction today is [$8]( (it was $50 a year ago), or $16000 for 1MB block. Assuming the cost would the same for a gigablock because storage and bandwidth will be cheap: if you're willing to spend 16 grands to store your photos, you're welcome.

Bitcoin can be both settlement and for buying coffee. No limits required: most users will use wallets like Circle or Coinbase anyway, which can send transactions without touching the blockchain. It's okay as long as there's choice to either use them or send money directly on blockchain. 
The problem with the limit is that it tries to force users info offchain solutions. Economy doesn't work like that. Just because I can't send money via blockchain, it doesn't mean I would want to use Circle. Without access to blockchain there's no use in Circle either.

20mb is the worst (or the best) case.  Perhaps we will not see actual 20mb blocks in 10 years. But the point is that if we will, then it would be better to accept them than to reject and miss an opportunity for adoption. Because the benefits of a spike in adoption outweigh downsides of heavier nodes. And we can handle it even today. 
The research is the history of Bitcoin and common sense. Bitcoin gets more decentralized over time despite bigger blocks, it's more decentralized today with 400kb than 5 years ago with 10kb. The current decline in full nodes is caused by the price decline. But the trend will eventually reverse. Also, higher price will attract tons of miners and new pools.

@_date: 2015-06-05 07:12:09
Miners are directly interested in growing Bitcoin's adoption and value. Increased usage contributes to Bitcoin utility and eventually, the price. If miners can handle those transactions, and if they are collecting fees for them, then they are not excessive and absolutely should be processed, because it's good for Bitcoin. Trying to artificially restrict Bitcoin usage is bad for Bitcoin.
Transactions are excessive only if fees are not sufficient or blocks are growing too big for miners to handle.
Currently the fees are negligible and block reward is sufficient, so miners are more interested in processing smaller blocks with faster propagation regardless of fees.  And the blocks are still small enough, so miners process most of transactions, even without fees. But they can reject spam if they see it as spam.
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:22:05
Oh, but why are you trying to pretend like we're discussing history? I'm afraid you're trolling.
You're stating a fact (number of nodes have dropped), and then you make an implication (number of nodes won't grow), pretending the implication is also a fact. This is demagoguery, or trolling.


Which is the problem. You're making assumptions about future based on past events, without giving a shit about reasons of those events. You can't refute future by past while ignoring the reasons. 




How is it like what you said? If the number won't increase, doesn't mean it won't decrease. If 100KB limit will cause users to quit, it will definitely decrease the number of nodes.

@_date: 2015-06-10 13:26:27


Wallets and mixers should address this. This is one of the reasons why we need bigger blocks by the way.


The declining price affects miners' profits and encourages centralization (even though, given the price went down from 1200 to 220, I'd say mining is still amazingly decentralized). This isn't a real problem, first, pools do not control miners, miners control their pools. A pool taken over by government will be abandoned by miners. 
Second, when the price will skyrocket again, miners will have plenty of profits and there will be more new pools and new miners. We need bigger blocks to accept growing demand.
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:56:59
Miners profits depend directly on BTC price. The more people use Bitcoin, the bigger demand for Bitcoin, the higher the price. If blocks get too big that it creates a *real* danger of centralization (which would allow for double spending or fractional reserve banking), people stop using Bitcoin and price falls. So, miners have to follow the market. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 12:13:51
If miners make enough money, then the fees are sufficient. Nobody is obligated to subsidize "regular people", they shouldn't run a node unless they benefit from it.


?? By that logic it's pointless to do anything, because it's impossible to say what will happen. But we sure know what happens when a merchant has no profit: he raises his prices and reduces production, it's the only logical action, unless you're implying laws of physics and economics will change. 


Higher price puts a downward pressure on demand, if you're going to nitpick. That's precisely the purpose of the limit here: reduce the amount of transactions people send (because if it doesn't, then blocks stay clogged up forever). You can't craft a precise hard limit in a laboratory without unintended consequences, especially far in the future - my point exactly.

You do want to change away the core principle: deflation. You argue in this very thread Bitcoin doesn't need growing demand, only "bagholders" want it. I don't own much btw, so your adhominem is pointless.

@_date: 2015-06-11 10:12:49
First, pools centralization doesn't mean mining centralization. A pool doesn't control its miners, miners control their pool - if a pool harms Bitcoin it affects Bitcoin price and miners abandon the pool, being concerned about their profits. 
Higher BTC price drives higher profits for the whole mining industry and attracts maximum amount and distribution of hashing power.
Second, "economy of scale" is a bogus pro-regulation argument. It exists, but it has limits and it doesn't prevent competition itself. If a pool has huge profits, it motivates creation of many other pools of similar size. Centralization in modern economy isn't caused by "economy of scale", but by artificial entry barriers (such as patents or licenses) and/or sophisticated knowledge required for running a business. Mining is a trivial business. You just need more capital. 
In the end it all boils down to BTC price. If BTC will rise, mining will be decentralized. Price is adoption, adoption is usage, usage is transactions. Restricting transactions will not decentralize mining, but will only prevent future decentralization.

A pool controlled by government is a rogue pool. Miners abandon it and it's no longer controlled by government. 
But let's say ALL big data centers are controlled by government. No problem at all: THEN people create small nodes/pools with small blocks and high fees, and miners and users go there.

@_date: 2015-06-10 13:10:58
They do have limits, the current soft limit is 750kb, if blocks become full, they can raise it. But a limit itself isn't a way to reduce spam, it's just a measure how big blocks currently can get. 
The proper market way to avoid spam is higher fees. There is no problem so far, miners can handle almost all transaction. If spam will become a constant problem, they can introduce higher fees to reduce it. They already reject "dust" transactions.

If you're miner:

1) Do nothing, miners aren't stupid, and internet will become faster eventually.
@_date: 2015-06-25 09:09:00
I see the source of your confusion: you have no idea how Bitcoin works. 
To process transactions, miners pay millions for electricity, for bandwidth and for mining equipment. They pay for it by selling bitcoins they mine. They can sell them because someone buys them. BTC buyers are paying to miners for their coins. Which covers the cost of processing transactions for everyone. Essentially, we pay for transactions with inflation. If you personally don't pay 8$, doesn't mean it's free. The cost is there. 
Miners probably make some profits, but not too much, since many of them go out of business.
In future, when block reward diminishes, we will have to pay the full price directly. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:47:49
why would people send gigabytes of transactions with such system?
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:05:21


If it becomes a *real* problem, people will run more nodes despite difficulties and/or will send less transactions (because of fear of insecurity), which will make blocks smaller again. Blocks grow not because of higher limits, for God's sake!!!


It doesn't have to be defined, it's up to miners to decide what transactions they can and want to process with the resources available and the fee offered to them.


Then don't use them. We must have a choice. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 19:37:28


Please. Nothing can be further from the truth. The arguments for the 1MB limit are based on the flawed mainstream economic theory very appealing to the simple minded general public, which is exactly why it is mainstream.
Many pro-1MB-ers still can't grasp that 20x raised limit doesn't mean people immediately start sending 20x more transactions. That Bitcoin grows not because you increase limit, but because people use it more. 
They don't realize centralization and consolidation in the modern economy are caused by artificial restrictions, not by absence of them. That artificial production quotas which intended to help small manufacturers only achieve the opposite: less profits for the whole industry and more centralization for the few wealthiest who can survive reduced profits. 
They can't understand that the idea that bigger nodes = less decentralization only holds true if Bitcoin isn't growing. The assumption here is that Bitcoin is a limited "pie", while there is no "pie", it has room of 7bn people to grow. That an attempt to artificially cripple Bitcoin's usage can only restrict its growth, adoption, utility, value and eventually decentralization.
The arguments for free unrestricted market are subtle and hard to grasp for most of the population. Bitcoin was created to disprove the mainstream economic theory and that's why Bitcoin community here mostly consists of people who don't share the beliefs that don't work in the modern regulated economy.

You're desperately trolling because you have no arguments left. 


The fact that some governments run datacenters is irrelevant to the fact that there are hundreds of thousands datacenters out there who profit from their users despite their costs. A small company I work for provides cloud backup stored in a datacenter, we don't need government, our clients pay to us. 
Hey. Maybe governments need to improve competition among datacenters? Lets have a hard limit on amount of storage they can sell to customers! It will help competition by keeping costs down, right?
Your theory: "If your resources are paid for by block rewards and block reward is proportional to the cost of running a full node, the biggest miner always wins, meaning any new datacenters competing are essentially charities."
Reality: GHash is the biggest miner, new competitors enter the market, make profits and displace it despite growing costs. 


The question was "Is cost of running a datacenter proportional to the profits of datacenter?" If yes, then your theory is demonstrably false, since there are numerous datacenters, if no, it's just irrelevant. 
Nobody would argue that BTC price literally linearly related to the block size, I've no idea why you focused on that. The point was that block size eventually represents growing demand which contributes to the BTC growth according to the supply/demand law. So increased cost of running a node is an investment which translates into higher profits, just like building a bigger datacenter brings higher profits due to higher sales despite increased costs. Maximized profit attracts maximum new competitors willing to make similar profit. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:26:25
How does *"processing transactions have costs"* follow to *"fee should be fixed by the protocol"*?? Fees should be whatever miners decide, as they are those who process, validate, and store them in the first place. The fact that miners don't care for higher fees means that the existing fees are acceptable for them. 
There is no such thing as "shark miners", it's a free market, merchants are free to decide what transaction to include or reject earlier or later, they find an equilibrium price by competing and maximizing their profits. 
You're trying to centrally regulate market prices, it's an unreasonable thing in the Bitcoin economy (or any other economy for that matter). 
"include a fee that is 10% more than" - That's pointless, miners are fully capable to announce required fees explicitly, just as we know today that sending a transaction usually requies a minimal fee of 0.0001 BTC, or VISA requires 3% fee. They can and should raise the fees in case number of transactions is higher than they can process due to physical limitations or lack of resources, that's how market works.

The fees can work if miners collaborate with wallets beforehand to raise the fees in advance. But miners must choose their own limits themselves. With a hard limit they have no option to raise it in case of emergency. 
And fees prevent wider usage of Bitcoin exactly when people need it and miners are ready to process it. So, even if it works eventually, it still harms Bitcoin, it's a totally unnecessary curb for growth and value of Bitcoin.

We care about daily purchases because we know they make Bitcoin powerful and allow it to resist censorship. But it's more than just censorship: it's the limited supply that makes Bitcoin special and can change the world. The limited supply eliminates inflation. Believe me, everyone in the world prefers deflationary money over inflationary. That's the main reason why Bitcoin will succeed and attract millions and billions of people.

@_date: 2015-06-24 22:35:57
I didn't say fees are fixed, I said they likely will rise. Central planners can't set fees: miners choose any fees they want, and if they're lazy, it only proves the current fees are sufficient for them. And they are sufficient because miners are paid with the block reward. 
I didn't say revenue will stay constant: I said, the best case, it won't rise. If it rises, the cost of a block will be even higher. The block reward is guaranteed to disappear eventually. If some miners drop out, the rest of them can have any fees in the world from the astronomical transactions volume. And then the difficulty drops and more miners will enter the market again. 
We're not talking about including a transaction, but a whole block, which costs $16000 at the moment. If you understand we're living in a real physical world, miners couldn't do that same work for free.

Spam can be avoided trivially. Miners can set soft limits any time or increase fees if they see there are too many spammy transactions. There's already a protection against "dust" transactions. The only reason why fees are not higher today is because there's no need for higher fees now.
The fork is planned on 2016, not today. The whole network must be upgraded in advance. If some part fails to upgrade when it's time, Bitcoin will split. 
There's a risk, keeping the limit puts the network at risk. Even if  a 3mb limit will be fine for a next 5 years, do we know how much do we need after that? Do we want to go though the same controversy again then? It will be even more difficult. Nothing will be different, exactly the same arguments will be used - "we don't need big blocks, we can raise fees, we don't want centralization", except now the network well be even bigger.

I am from Belarus. Bitcoin is not particularly helpful at the moment, because we can still use foreign currencies, even if there's a legal risk of buying/selling them. 
But here's another problem: all my $$$ are in a bank. And in the light of the current crisis I'm worried what can happen to our banking system in case of a bank run. Usually I can easily withdraw as many as I need from a cash machine, but today they all are empty, because everyone tries to convert as many BYR to USD as possible (using ATMs). 
This exact situation repeats for the THIRD TIME for the last 5 years. I'm starting to think about other ways to store my money. Usually when people don't trust banks, they buy gold and cash, but that's not very convenient. 
During the 2008/2009 crisis I tried to move from BYR to Webmoney, because it was the easiest way to buy $ during a panic. Electronic cash is quite useful for such cases. Bitcoin also can be helpful the same way, but it needs more stability. I hold very little in BTC, but I'm looking forward to it as a tool to diversify my savings.

Mainstream economics is a pseudoscience. Economics in general is a real science since it is based on real objective laws and principles. Bitcoin can only succeed if fundamental economic principles behind it are real. Implementing them in code is a rather straightforward technical work. Analyzing and understanding their power to change the world takes a brilliant mind and no less than a prophetic vision.  
Belittling Economics as a "pseudoscience" is what makes governments believe the laws of economics don't exist and can be easily broken with enough force. Central bank monopolies trying to bend markets is one of the results of such thinking.

Actually, it's not different, since 1MB is just a random number that is just as good as every other; 1MB today would be like 200KB in 2013; That logic implies keeping 200KB in 2013 would be a good thing. 


Because it makes him poorer long term and even short term he risks his multimillion investments. That attack only makes sense with the assumption that Bitcoin cannot be successful long term. If that assumption is correct, then it doesn't matter how large blocks are.


If the network can't handle it, then miners will set their own soft limits. If users demand more transactions and miners can provide them, then limiting it will only restricts growth, utility, value of Bitcoin. If we're not running out of capacity, then blocks will not grow (raising the limit doesn't raise blocks). 
Waiting until we run out of capacity is literally asking for a crisis of capacity. Hardforking during a crisis is more dangerous than now, since a hardfork requires time to pass smoothly.

A bubble crashes the same very moment the market realizes it's a bubble. Before that moment there's no way to tell, otherwise it would burst earlier.
The real culprit of the crash is the creator of the bubble. Who was bending the housing market by using implicit government guarantees, who forced the banks to issue risky mortgages to poor, and who made them look sound by flooding the market with cheap money. It was Fannie Mae, "Community Reinvestment Act", and Alan Greenspan. 
It was a big government policy aimed to increase home ownership. Because "free market" was allegedly not friendly to people, not giving enough mortgages to poor. So they decided to "fix" free market. Well they did fix it.
It's ridiculous to blame banks for bubbles. It's like blaming trees for wind. Banks do not have a monopoly on money creation, nor they have a power to create a distortions on a market. Government is the biggest player, has the biggest power, and yet it never admits it caused troubles. Never in history. Government always finds someone else to blame. It can only admit it was too generous, too kind. Not enough "regulations", not enough violence, not enough beating. When government fails, it only gets bigger.

People including you don't realize MtGox did so much harm because of centralization caused by regulation. MtGox got so big not just because it's the oldest. Btc/usd exchange requires expensive money transmitting license from the government, which prevents entering many new companies to the market.

Yeah, that's the theory,  but where's the empirical evidence? In reality patent allows few companies to invest less and cuts off many other companies from investing.
Why 10 or 20 years? If monoploy increases investments, wouldn't 50 or 100 years bring even more investments? And if you agree that expiration should be reduced, then how did you calculate the precise amount - 10 years for anything?
The reward should be determined by market, not by central planners. A company which enters the market with an innovative product first makes huge profits. Without patents companies would have to be innovative constantly. Simultaneous competitive r &amp; d would result in more progress than an arbitrary enforced monopoly.

"public institution"
It seems to me people confuse "public" and "government". The main point of saying that Fed is "private" is to say that it doesn't serve public interest. But that's the thing about government - it never serves public, it only follows its own interests, even when on the surface it seems otherwise. "Public" != "government"! "Government" = those who govern by force, everything else is irrelevant. Every law has private lobbyists who benefit from it, if that make it "private", then what does "government" mean?. FED is a monopoly created by government, protected by government, which essentially means it is a government. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:53:47
The article expresses the old marxist view on business cycle. I.e. the market itself generates repeating boom-bursts (therefore it should be "regulated" by government violence). While it may *look appealing, the problem with that theory is that it ignores facts. For example, it's well known that dotcom bubble wasn't caused by "new technology", but was fueled by FED artificially low rates. Similar with railroad booms in 19th century - artificial government subsidies for railroad companies. 
Another good example: today we can see a micro-boom in Tesla cars sales in Norway. Model S is the top selling car there. Is it the "new technology" causes it? Not really, while Tesla is an excelent piece of innovation, the actual reason for the boom is ridiculously high taxes on non-electrical vehicles in Norway.

It wasn't nearly "so volatile" as bitcoin today. There were some periods of inflation and deflation, but gold was stable enough to be a money when it was a money, providing adequate price signals and much more stability to the economy, compared to the centrally planned currency.

Wake up people, a municipal fiber is not the answer. 
Yes, a municipality can build a fiber cheaply, but not because it has higher moral standards than greedy capitalists. **A government simply doesn't have to deal with its own regulations**. 
In effect, you have an absolute monopoly no one can fight. It might look appealing for now, but long term wise it's the worst. It stops any competition, it doesn't have to fight for customers, it can take your money forcefully via taxation. 
And without a competition there's no progress. Good luck trying to make it better by voting.
Instead of having just one undesctructable monopoly, it's better to allow anyone to build a network cheaply and freely, and have a normal competition. Google fiber is an example of what happens when you allow a company to do so. The problem is that not everyone has a Google's name to convince a government.

You don't pay for fixed speed, because it's impossible to provide such, because the total bandwidth resource ISP has is limited. You pay for maximum speed under certain conditions, you can't have it when many subscribers are downloading heavy content simultaneously, which is exactly what happening during Netflix shows. Actually a small part of ISP subscribers watching Netflix or downloading torrents can degrade the speed for the rest of subscribers.
Guaranteed speed for everyone would cost much much more, it's literally like having an individual lane for every single car. So, you have to either throttle the heaviest part of the traffic or ask someone to pay for it.
Actually I don't think ISP will not build new lanes, they invest all the time, and they don't have huge profits, it's like 9% net profit for Comcast in 2013.

* Forbidding trade to be carried in foreign ships;
* mercantilist writers emphasized the circulation of money and rejected hoarding.

My conspiracy *theory is that bad guys wanted to destroy Bitcoin. 
At first they decided to hit where they can reach easily: fiat side of exchanges. Hence the confiscations and investigations. 
But then they realized that USD withdrawal difficulties only cause growth of BTC (the same way the drug prohibition only makes drugs more expensive and druglords more powerful). 
The obvious decision after that was to hit the opposite side - BTC withdrawals. They found a breach (malleability) and exploited it (they also were behind that massive DDoS attack).

But I never said wokers can't control or withhold their labor. Contrary, I said - leave if you dislike the job, stop offering your labor, noone is forcing you to work here.
Yes, it's an exchange. But only if it's voluntary. You can negotiate, accept, or refuse and leave. What you can't is to use force to control what isn't yours - a company, or another workers who are willing to work for less.
What you're all missing is that building and running a company is a labor too, just as your labor. Earning and saving a capital for starting a business from scratch is a labor. 
Employer is a human with a basic rights just like you. He has the right to refuse your labor just like you can refuse to work with him. He has the right to control its company (labor) just like you control your labor. If you break one part of the equation (company owner's property rights), the other part will be broken too. Apllying a force to employers kills the incentives to be an employer, to create a new business, to offer an alternative. The force government uses against companies comes back on to workers. That's why the most communist regimes are the worst oppressors of workers.

It doesn't make sense by the definition of "good". "Good" or "bad" doesn't exist outside of a free conscious person. 
You may say it's good for cells to be fed, to live, to split, but what's good about that without even realizing it? 
Even if you assume it's "good" for cells, people are infinitely bigger that just living and eating. Unlike cells, "good/bad" is subjective for every single human being. Without a free consciousness, "good" is meaningless. There's no good for a brain dead person to be alive and fed. We keep him alive only if we hope he will get conscious again someday. 
The only universal "good" is freedom and consciousness, by the definition of "good". And your system only works if you remove it, by reducing humanity to the state of mindless cells.

Nobody is saying it's *only* utility, the point is that value is *based* on utility.
Scarcity of a useful item obviously increases its value, but again - only if it's useful. Rare and useless item is can't be valuable, like oil prior to invention of cars.
And in some cases scarcity *is* [the part of] utility. Bitcoin is one of such cases, because scarcity helps to preserve the price. But again - only because it's useful in another regards - portability, divisibility, immutability.

If selling cracked eggs becomes a common practice, then yes, it stimulates people to do a research (by their own or by hiring an expert), thus learning to prevent such situations. 
You can replace "cracked egg" with "damaged car". When selling a used car, a seller is not obligated to tell you anything about it, but you should take all the precautions, make a research, and if the seller refuses to reveal the car history, or sells it suspiciously cheap, you can take this information into account as well.

One thing puzzles me: why NOBODY have ever reported about accidentally receiving double or triple amount of BTC? At least someone should. MtGox knows their names and addresses anyway.
Similar question, what about "stuck" transactions, which happened before the withdrawal suspension? As I understand those "failed" transactions should have succeeded eventually, and result in double-triple-multiple withdrawals. Nobody ever told about this.
For example, this guy:


I think this was some sort of ironic joke. I quickly tried to withdraw them again; but surprise, surprise, stuck again.

This is so stupid. "Net neutrality" is an obscure orwellian wording for "price control", which never works as declared, only makes things worse.
 Instead of removing the regulations which caused the lack of competition and high cost of providing an internet service in the first place people want even more regulations. 
Inevitable result will be an increase of monopolization and raised prices. 
It's always easy to blame an evil corporation without seeing the core reasons.
[Local governments and their public utilities charge ISPs far more than these things actually cost. For example, rights of way and pole attachments fees can double the cost of network construction. So the real bottleneck isn’t incumbent providers of broadband, but incumbent providers of rights-of-way. These incumbents — the real monopolists — also have the final say on whether an ISP can build a network. They determine what hoops an ISP must jump through to get approval.](

It works as it should. Someone may dislike that it's not given out for 1$ of for free, it doesn't mean you have a moral right to "demand" any price you like. Price and quality are an equilibrium between demand and supply.
If a company is not willing to offer a product with a qualities you like, and you sure it's perfectly possible, then you're free to create your own. Transparency can be a highly demanded competitive advantage for an exchange, just as for any publicly traded company.
If nobody is able to offer a product of the same quality, it only proves the price is justified, as long as people are willing to pay it voluntarily.

I think this is incorrect. At best, it's "no consequences for *totally untraceable* immoral decisions". If you can detect an insider trading (like, O.P. thinks he can), and you believe it harms you as a customer, then a loss of reputation is the consequence which can lead to a loss of the business.

First, you should prove MtGox intentionally stole your money. As I can see, it suffers from the situation just like the others.
Second, you are an absolute idiot who thinks you can improve MtGox by beating it. You are basically asking for a government intervention. That's how governments are created. 
The thing is, MtGox itself has the strongest possible incentive to fix the problem. There is absolutely nothing, ZERO you can add to this by protesting, suing, insulting. You wont help them to work better with this. Actually, you're only making things worse. Just like any violent government intervention always makes things worse.

The same story with airplanes (Wright brothers patent wars resulted in stalled progress in US air industry compared to Europe) or 3D printers today or many other things.

No surprise, patents are merely a special case of central planning, a government-enforced monopoly, which always works in a manner opposite to declared intention. Every time you apply violence, you have an effect opposite to what you wanted.

If there was no Federal Reserve Board, you might have a point. But we're not discussing the banks per se, and without the Board there is no Federal Reserve System. FRS as a whole is a government entity.


This "regulation" is the only thing important. **Monetary policy is dictated by the Federal Reserve Board**, not by private shareholders. Board appointed members ensure the control and oversight of Reserve Banks. The presidents of the Reserve Banks must be approved by the Board too. Sounds like a direct enough control to me.

So MtGox collapse is used as an excuse for "regulations". Cui bono?..
New regulations will further limit the competition and will push exchanges underground (like BTC-e). Short-term wise it will stifle the development, but also can make BTC more expensive  - like drugs because of the war on drugs, or GoxBTC because of FinCEN related problems with banks. Any regulation increases a price. 
Long term it's insignificant, as BTC gets more and more disconnected from fiat (quite a distant perspective though). BTC itself is immune to "regulations".

Dude, while I appreciate your stance on Bitcoin, your definitions make zero sense.
If capitalism is about consuming, then Soviet Union was capitalist, since people were forced to consume as much as produced by government controlled factories. 
What you're describing is socialism. 
Socialism is a government ownership of means of production = government  controlling economy = government forcing people. "Companies" can't force you to buy their products without a central authority. Forcing people to spend is only possible through a government enforced money monopoly, when you can't escape inflation by switching to another currency. And Central Bank is one of the items of Marx's Communist manifesto.
Capitalism is not about spending or consuming or hoarding or whatever. As opposed to socialism/communism, capitalism is people acting in their own interests without coercion from a central authority, that's it. 
Central Bank = socialism, Bitcoin is an instrument of ultimate capitalism, as it aims to undermine the most essential government monopoly and gives people power over their money.

Over the last 9 month Bitcoin jumped to 1200 and attracted the world attention thanks to MtGox. For the same reason MtGox has become a target of government investigations/regulations/seizures, which caused delays in usd withdrawals. 
Btc withdrawals suspention wouldn't be such a problem if TM problem wouldn't affect the other exchange as well, which was admitted by bitcoin foundation, along with  misinterpretation of MtGox statement. Nobody said that "bitcoin is at fault", until btc foundation members falsely stated "mtgox says bitcoin is at fault"

"Oversight, regulations and guarantees" are drawbacks, not benefits. Central bank guarantee harms the banking system, **provoking** reckless behavior, not preventing it. And regulations limit competition, thus preventing new honest players from entering the market to replace the old corrupted ones.
Free market is the best possible guarantee that [any] dishonest bank will go bankrupt. This will be a strongest incentive to the other players to act cautiously. 
If Gox really ran out of money, I sincerely hope it will bankrupt. It will result in a great benefit for the health of BTC infrastructure.

That's an interesting point, but energy doesn't exist in pure form. It is contained in some physical object - timber, oil, uranium. So the value of this object depends on your ability to extract the energy, and it's only good if you don't have something better. 
I.e. burning timber is not very useful when you have better alternatives, like gas. And uranium has negative value if you don't have a nuclear plant. 
Intrinsic value is the value object has for it's own sake, not for something else.

The definition is clear from the context: "naturally" implies governments are inherent to human nature, so that it's impossible for humanity to exist without State, that State is inevitable no matter what we do (unless we "evolve into something different"). 
Humans were doing many things throughout centuries, like slavery, absolutism, cannibalism, inquisition, etc: nothing of those was "natural" (in the sense above), it only existed because it was socially acceptable, until humans realized how wrong and damaging it was for everyone: not just for victims, but for humanity as a whole.
So, one can say that humans naturally fall into delusions (because, you know, we're not gods - even if our rulers believe they are), which harm us. But we also naturally seek for truth and for individual freedoms. To see the cage is to leave it.

Your pro-regulation stance is pointless. "The right way" is the one that makes things better, by the very definition of "right". In the real world, a regulation that makes things worse should be removed and not fixed by another regulation, because a) this way has no end, b) this is outrageously stupid.
"Elementary", or "needed for *some things*" are not arguments. 
We have a straight fact: there's absolutely zero benefit for anyone (except bunch of folks in local governments) from enforced cable monopolies. No benefit from stopping businesses from building a network. No benefit for customers or the economy from charging new ISP megabucks for a permission to build a network. No benefit from trying to force ISPs to build a network for citizens who don't consume it.

You should ask yourself where did this deflation come from. There was no experiment of stopping printing press for 20 years, and JPY doesn't have limited supply like Bitcoin. Contrary, Japanese central bank for the last 20 years tries to fight deflation by printing more money, without any success.
Japanese economy have impact of crisis. The deflation is a consequence of the crisis, not the cause. The cause is monetary inflation in the 1980th.

The miners have the same incentive. When a pool comes close to 50%, the personal cost of leaving it is nothing compared to the personal outcome of staying in pool: after leaving you can just go to another pool and continue mining, but staying reduces your profits and destroys everything you have.
If you are right, than GHash.io should already have like 70% or more. But I'm right, so you're clearly out of touch with reality.

I'm from Belarus. People are already using $ as a solution against government inflation. Bitcoin doesn't seem to be any more useful in the current situation.
It's more interesting that the government constantly tries to ban illegal $ exchange, even jailing underground traders, without **any** success. Instead, the wide use of dollar by the people forces the government to discipline its own monetary policy.
1) It can be seen as an example why government bans are worthless. If Bitcoin will gain popularity, if people will see the benefits against government money, no government can stop it.
2) Bitcoin doesn't need to replace government money completely, but it can force governments to alter their policies. That's what competition does.

What you marxists don't understand is that the only source of monopolisation is the government monopoly of violence. Not "capital", but government. No money will buy you a monopoly supported by violence without a government selling it, and government is the only seller possible, by the very definition of government.
Government always sells its powers to those who pay, guess why? Because it fucking loves money. 
It's insanely naive to believe that giving the government *more* powers will magically make it *less* corrupt. Contrary, it only creates more opportunities to abuse the power.

Other theory is that government is somehow involved. They confiscated 144k BTC from SilkRoad. And we know $5 mln MtGox seizure was actually [linked to SilkRoad](

Do you seriously believe that 750k are gone because of "malleability-related theft unnoticed for years" and "cold storage has been wiped"? That's not ridiculous? 
Here's how you "wipe" the cold storage:
[The overwhelming majority of BTC are held in cold storage. Logistically and legally in would be difficult to replicate the transfer “trick” Mark previously employed at Gox to prove their solvency. Obviously I can’t go into too much detail for security reasons, but it would involve physically obtaining them from 6 or more locations.](

The joke is on you, beating a strawman, again. I never said "government-sponsored", I said "supported". Unions are protected by government legislations. Without government protection they wouldn't even exist. Without force you can't stop non-unionized workers to take your job. In many countries it's strictly illegal for an employer to hire a non-unionized replacement worker during a strike, or to lock out its property.
It's even funnier you're trying to appeal to "history", without knowing a bit of it. Even without state protection, violence always has been an inheritent feature of unions. Violence against employers and "rats, scabs, strikebreakers". Damaging an equipment is not the worst example. At least you could've heard of unions cooperating with mafia to treat employers.


Another strawman, wow. While my opponents have said that employers are evil, I never said anything about workers being evil. Unions are evil, as they are against workers - that's why their popularity in US steadily declines over the decades. 
And I know what is communism way better than you, I was born in USSR. Striking as "refusing to work" isn't a communism, but without being protected by government force striking is pointless - you will be replaced immediatelly.

European colonizers in fact relied on bribing and cooperation with local authorities to gain power and influence in Asian region.

Putin doesn't think trading is better because he's insane. But he can only annex territories inhabited by pro-Russian pro-communist population which welcomes that. 
By the way, Hitler was initially welcomed by western Ukrainians, because they despised the Soviet rule. But he would have failed eventually, just as Soviet Union itself collapsed when citizens en masse have decided socialism doesn't work.

It's a known fact they have a problems with USD withdrawals because of government.
They didn't say anything close to "fucking major bug in the bitcoin protocol". 
It's widely known there're technical problems which BTC withdrawals. It's a fact this problem has affected other exchanges as well, not just MtGox. 
There's no reason to think they are holding "everybody's money hostage". It's known they are currently fixing it.
So they can't just resume withdrawing BTC, which means the only way to "stop accepting trading fees" is to stop trading. This would cause nothing else but more panic.

If sending and storing transactions is costly, then fees should be determined based not only on the amount of BTC sent, but on the transaction size. E.g. 1KB = $0.01

Nothing wrong with any form of self regulation as long as it is voluntary.
When the market realizes a neccetivity of such audit, then businesses themselves get the strongest incentive to ask for audit by a private company, without enforcing, and customers get the strongest incentive to trust audited companies only. Private auditors can compete too. There's nothing useful government can add to this, because governments are run by people no better than others. 
Government regulation does more harm: Enforced audit is a monopoly, which makes it corrupt and inefficient (see Madoff). After enforced audit comes guaranteed insurance and bailouts. Enforced regulation suppresses the progress: world is dynamic, an audit may look like a good solution today, but tomorrow market may invent something more effective.
Anyway, there's no point in arguing about this when it comes to Bitcoin. Trying to replicate the system already existing is useless. We already have USD and wall street for those who adore regulations and bailoits, there would be no point in creating Bitcoin if we wanted it.

Stop repeating mantras without proving. The fact that companies need people doesn't prove that they "don't give jobs". Repeating isn't proving. 
By the same twisted logic workers don't give any labor because without a company they have nothing at all.
You don't have to worship anyone. You don't have to accept an offer you don't like. If you're not benefitting from having the job, then go away. If you're "underpaid" then go where you're not. 
By your logic accepting an offer from an employer gives you a right to use force to control it's property. This logic works both ways. That is what leads to workers being helpless depenent leechers, ask workers in DPRK or USSR.

If you agree, then I don't see how high price of a rare item, which is also useful, can be seen as irrational.
If you're not forgetting about relative value of money, then your initial statement about "overestimated happiness" doesn't make sense. The amount of happiness is estimated by a buyer himself, not by you. If he is willing to pay such a price - then this price is perfectly proportional to his happiness.
Besides, it's not simply "happiness". His happiness is based on a qualities of an item, which can be used as a food for his mind, emotions, and eyes. 
Also the rare item can be used as an investment, which is also an utility.

I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm asking is there an incentive to it? What is the benefit and does it outweigh the cost? Because, if it doesn't then such attempts will be negligible. 
"It is easy to send transactions to yourself repeatedly. If these transactions fill blocks to the maximum size (1MB), other transactions would be delayed until the next block.
This is made expensive by the fees that would be required after the 50KB of free transactions per block are exhausted. An attacker will eventually eliminate free transactions, but Bitcoin fees will always be low because raising fees above 0.01 BTC per KB would require spending transaction fees. An attacker will eventually run out of money. Even if an attacker wants to waste money, transactions are further prioritized by the time since the coins were last spent, so attacks spending the same coins repeatedly are less effective."

Danger of miners regulation versus wallets regulation. What are your arguments that the former is preferable? How much do you have to increase the block size to allow 25000 tps, and how can you compete with big mining corporations then? It's absolutely the same.

@_date: 2015-05-26 22:21:50
Here's good explanation
This however, does not mean that the network would necessarily be able to process 16 GB of transaction data in 2035, because the soft limit, which Gavin is not proposing to change from its current 1 MB, will remain in the hands of miners. If &gt;50 percent of miners choose a particular soft limit, then the network will have to have blocks that remain at or under that size. That means that it is very likely that the effective block size limit will be below the hard limit.
We've already come up against a soft limit before: when it was at 250 kb, and it took a concerted campaign to get consensus to raise it. e.g:
So what all of this means is that immediately raising the hard limit to 16.9 MB, and having it double every two years, for 20 years, while leaving the soft limit up to miners, is actually quite conservative, because it's not that easy to raise the soft limit, and miners are not going to raise it unless there is significant demand for transactions relative to space in the blocks.

No, the actual argument here is "value is based on utility", or, specifically "Bitcoin's value is due to its utility". You stuck with "happines", but as I said, happiness is not random, it's based on item's utility.
You were trying to disprove this by "baseball card happiness isn't proportional to its price", and "high price of a rare item is an *irrational* reaction to its rarity". I'm only showing both these counter-arguments are false, because (again)
a) You don't define what's "proportional" or "high" for a buyer, it's relative. Hence your "price is unproportionally high" statement is meaningless.
b) It's perfectly rational to pay more for a *useful* item that is hard to get - which you admit as "axiomatic", so "irrational" argument is also a nonsense.
Now, I specifically dislike "irrational" argument, because you use it to prove that only a scarcity itself makes an item valuable, even if there's no any rationale (i.e. utility) in owning it.
But the fact that scarcity increases value, doesn't disprove that value is based on utility. It just shows utility is not the only factor. Obviously, scarcity makes item more valuable, yes. But only *because* it has a utility.  Diamonds obviously have utility - jewelry, and they always have been valuable. The price couldn't increase if diamonds had no use.
Useless rare item doesn't have any value. Oil without invention of cars isn't valuable. Uranium without nuclear plant has negative value. 
And, in some cases scarcity *itself* is a part of utility. Like, in case of BTC - scarcity helps to preserve price. But, again, it's not like scarcity is an ultimate value generator, instead, it's a special case where utility is made from scarcity. Plus, it increases BTC value only because of the rest of BTC useful properties: divisibility, portability, immutability. Remove any of these, and the scarcity of BTC would mean nothing.

That is absolutely irrelevant to the fact that higher demand for payments **will** drive the price up. The adoption **will** generate the demand. Well, if there will be no adoption, there won't be bigger blocks, problem solved.


I'm not sure what this question is about. Are you asking how pricing mechanism works? It's supply and demand. Demand is people accepting BTC in exchange for their dollars, things they sell, and work they do. What happens when people run out of dollars? Then we definitely won't have to worry about block size anymore.

Government-supported unions using a force against a company and strikebreakers is basically a communism. If you're talking about something else, then you've come to a wrong discussion.
I'm not against bargaining, I'm against using force to control what isn't yours. Refusing to leave a company, occupying a working place, damaging an equipment, forbidding others to accept the job you dislike, forcing other workers to strike with you. 
Asking for a raise is normal, I did it myself, but I didn't "strike", I just was ready to quit. If noone is offering you more, then it's nonsense to think your labor costs more. If "strike" is your only argument, then it proves you don't have a better offer.

"Formal voting" or "governance board" or anything will not magically create consensus out of disagreement. If people disagree, they should part.

@_date: 2015-05-31 20:08:45
Very good points. But none of them prove that Bitcoin will remain useful with 1mb limit kept forever. The increase will have to happen anyway sooner or later. 
Even if Bitcoin can survive congestion caused by the limit, the article doesn't answer the question what the limit should be. (And it's obviously not 1mb)
It says people will stop using blockchain for trivial cases, but how do you decide which cases are trivial and "should" be offchain? Sending a tip? Buying a coffee? Buying a pair of jeans? Buying a smartphone? 
How about letting the market decide instead of making it difficult artificially? Let people create an attractive off chain solution instead of trying to force users out. Do Coinbase or Circle require keeping a 250kb limit to get popular? Do you expect people will use Circle more just because they can't send money directly? The market doesn't work like that, it works the opposite way.


This argument is completely ludicrous. If something is so popular that people are willing to pay high fees to access it, it is showing tremendous value. 
Unless it is popular due to the absence of ridiculously high fees. It's popular because you don't have to use an off chain third party. What makes you think it will still be popular, when people cannot send their money without paying at least a 100$ fee? Where's the line? What is the correct price?

TOTC is a favorite excuse for central planning, but it's a fallacy. There is no "charity" and no commons here. Running a node gives a Bitcoin-related service the individual benefit of faster and safer verification. As adoptions grows, the number of nodes will grow naturally just due to the law of large numbers. Even enthusiasts count too, they run nodes for themselves, not for "society". 
Wider adoption = more business, more miners, more enthusiasts, more nodes. But to achieve that, we need Bitcoin to run smooth. Hitting the limit is not the way to incentivize miners and new payment services, instead, stalled transactions will cause people to panic and quit. Think of MtGox users unable to withdraw their money.


Increasing the cap will not suddenly make you require a higher bandwidth. It took 5 years for blocks to raise to 0.4 MB despite the 1MB limit. Quite possible blocks will not increase to 20MB in the next 10 years. 
Bitcoin growth can't be always exponential, and progress never stops. Long term wise, bandwidth/storage/ram/whatever is not an issue.


The more I think of this theory, the sillier it looks to me. 
It costs money. The smaller blocks are, the less the effect. To make some harm on others, you need really huge blocks. Skeptics were saying about 1GB blocks to prove the point. And then a) it costs more money to you. b) other miners can set soft limits to ignore unusually large blocks. c) other miners can start doing the same against you. Essentially, it's the "the war of all against all" argument. This tactic doesn't work, because it hurts you eventually. 
The average block size can grow significantly only due to significant rise in adoption. And higher adoption brings higher decentralization.
@_date: 2015-05-09 22:05:21
Yes, but there's difference. Liberty Reserve was pegged to USD 1:1, so it was simple to use as money. But nobody knew if something like Bitcoin can become money.

"The third step in bitcoin’s consensus mechanism is independent validation of each new block by every node on the network. As the newly solved block moves across the network, each node performs a series of tests to validate it before propagating it to its peers. This ensures that only valid blocks are propagated on the network. The independent validation also ensures that miners who act honestly get their blocks incorporated in the blockchain, thus earning the reward. Those miners who act dishonestly have their blocks rejected and not only lose the reward, but also waste the effort expended to find a proof-of-work solution, thus incurring the cost of electricity without compensation.
When a node receives a new block, it will validate the block by checking it against a long list of criteria that must all be met; otherwise, the block is rejected. These criteria can be seen in the Bitcoin Core client in the functions CheckBlock and CheckBlockHeader and include:
The block size is within acceptable limits"

"If you decide to move to other country, that is your right; our laws here are enforced by consensus". Any government exists only as long as people submit to it, that doesn't make it decentralized. Having a rule about fixed amount of allowed transactions is a top-down centralized decision making. Users don't decide individually how much transactions inside the network is fine for them at any given moment - they don't have that ability anymore, but merely submit to some number decided for them by rulers. And I repeat, nobody can calculate that number correctly once and for all (nobody ever even tried), it is a random number that is guaranteed to damage Bitcoin the same way 1KB limit would damage it.

Then you can't logically prove that transactions should be limited. Especially to a some specific number like 1MB. 


How does it prove the necessity of hard limit? Without a limit you can have whatever number of anything. But with a cap you want to force anyone to use a limited number of LN hubs.


Blocking a node or a miner doesn't prevent a transaction, blocking an LN hub does. 
LN doesn't solve anything, it just shifts the problem into the hands of limited number of centralized entities.

That's simply untrue. The demand was much lower than 1MB for 6 years. Blocks would be filled almost immediately otherwise. In reality, they grew gradually, and sometimes even reduced in size.
@_date: 2016-03-08 09:53:30


No we didn't. There are some default values, but miners can set any fees for themselves, some of them allow or allowed zero fee transactions, some not anymore.
Having zero price would be perfect of course. But that's impossible physically. And that's the reason why protocol level limit is pointless. Miners will always set some price.

Please stop calling this "a fee market', it's annoyingly deceiving. A market would develop naturally by miners themselves setting their own limits and fees - precisely because they don't have an unlimited space and bandwidth. There's no need for a centrally planned limit because there are natural limits already.

About the same as it is now. Since 2010 Bitcoin was working as if there's no limit, blocks didn't become 1MB overnight, they were small until recently.

The fear is groundless and is based only on the mainstream economic theory, which Bitcoin is intended to disprove. Market does not create cartels: restrictions do.

Yes, no one gets hurt, nobody loses anything he already has, but the limit undermines Bitcoin' future potential. We wouldn't have what we have today, if there was a 10kb limit set 6 years ago.
The thing about centralized rule is that it doesn't work regardless of people's consent, as Mises has shown in "Road to serfdom". Even if people give up their choice voluntarily, collectivism doesn't work because of information problem/economic calculation problem. 
Specifically, there's no way to determine the fixed amount of transactions that will not harm Bitcoin's future value. And by value mean I everything - utility, security, price. 
Any attempt of doing that throws out the decentralized dynamic information the network possesses - the information about resources available to individual miners and nodes at any given moment, and the optimal level of utility without compromising security.

See? It's the same meaningless question, you can't give an answer because it doesn't exist. It's subjective. 


No that doesn't make sense. The hard limit limits the resources that are in fact available. It wouldn't be a hard limit otherwise. What you're saying only makes sense for something like soft limit, but it's implemented and working already.


You can choose another bank, sure, unless they all require licensing just like this one. Pity you can't choose the decentralized blockchain anymore, because 99% of transactions are censored out, to force you to use LN ~~banks~~ hubs.

Coercion is not that simple. It's impossible for a bunch of folks in government to violently coerce millions of people unless they agree to that. 99% of citizens submit to the law because they truly believe it's good to have a law. 
Starting a company is not centralization. Even though, big companies suffer similar problems as big governments. E.g. micromanagement is considered harmful. Google actively tries to avoid that.
Turning an existing network into a centralized company is centralization. It does removes the feedback from nodes and from miners - are blocks too big or not? And distorts price information, specifically - transaction fee. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 20:25:01

We've been there already, LibertyReserve, payment processors will be no different. Bitcoin was created to avoid using centralized solutions, not to become dependent on them.

1mb is fine as long as blocks are less than 1mb, same with 20mb, it will need to be raised eventually. As a constant limit, both are harmful, both are artificial. 
Restricting Bitcoin usage does not solve centralization problem, it creates more problems instead. Other scaling solutions may help, but a fixed limit is not a *solution", it solves nothing other than maybe ddos protection.
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:32:53
"There is no need to raise the maximum block size right now, the average block size is only about 400,000 bytes.”
This is actually a great reason why block limit _can_ and _should_ be increased: if the average block size doesn't just grow uncontrollably up to the 1MB limit now, it means raising limit won't cause block size to grow to 20MB.
@_date: 2016-03-06 19:56:32

Please define "you". It sounds like Bitcoin is centralized unless every single user runs its own node. Which is an obvious nonsense.
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:29:19


A hard limit limits the space that is in fact available. That is its literal purpose: to limit transactions that can and would be safely and securely processed otherwise. 
The ledger is not "public" in the sense you are putting in that word. It is not owned by some "public", but shared among individuals who take care of resources they individually possess. Miners, users, and nodes can and should determine proper amount of transactions at any given moment by interacting and sending market signals to each other - as they did successfully for the last six years until now.
A top down decision on how much space available for transactions, how much security there should be, and what is safe enough, is purely arbitrary, unavoidably incorrect (see [economic calculation problem]( and implies centralized ownership of the network. It radically changes Bitcoin nature and goes against all the values Bitcoin was created on.

Another realistic scenario: since there is no room for new users, they stop coming. When BTC supply still keeps growing and the demand is not, the price goes down.

Governments exist as long as people believe in them. People like you. Monopoly on violence can work only if people allow it. Governments rely on citizens' conformity. Even with existing monopoly even a powerful government with all its guns cannot stop people from selling and buying drugs. 
There is no central single authority on the planetary level: countries act as independent players, and nobody tries to acquire a monopoly and create a world government - countries believe trading is better than fighting. Hitler tried that and he failed. Why? Because nobody in the world accepted his rule. Because the world is bigger than a country, the same way society is bigger than a group of people.
So, the idea is not to violently overthrow the current government, - you're right, it will only create a new one, more violent; but to make governments obsolete (Bitcoin aims that, by the way). To destroy government, it should be destroyed in people's minds first.

Creating lots of transactions costs lots of money without having any direct benefits; also miners are able to set soft limits to ignore large blocks.
Split is bad, doing nothing is bad as well, we need consensus.
Keeping the limit will be devastating without options. The limit in effect means users want to send money but they can't, because Bitcoin just doesn't work. The Blockchain size can be a problem, but limiting transactions is not the way to solve it, it creates more problems.

Ok, let's say 90% of transactions today are pointless. But that's not the point. If the world embraces Bitcoin in future, blocks will grow due to economical demand. 


From millions and billions of people like you and me from all over the world. That is what "adoption" is about. It's not necessary means literal "money", dollars and cents. When people sell something for BTC instead of fiat, or work for BTC , it means the demand for fiat falls and demand for BTC raises.

What you call a cost is an added value to Bitcoin, he wouldn't have revenue otherwise. You can see that miners always mine blocks as small as possible.

By saying "everyone" you're still implying some bandwidth requirements. Not "everyone" in the world could easily handle 10-20x increase in actual block size in 2010 or 2011, many would have to quit. 
But honestly, trying to gain advantage that way seems as stupid in 2011 as in 2015 - paying premiums for essentially useless ultrahigh bandwidth without direct profit, hoping that maybe it will help you to sway competitors (and, again - you're never the only who can do that). 
It's like constantly selling stuff below the cost. Even if it gives you a market share, eventually you're bankrupt. 
It's even more stupid to pay for bandwidth able to handle junk 1GB blocks today than 1MB 5 years ago. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:24:36
Mining wasn't for profit in 2010? 2011? I don't think it's true. 
The thing is, the privilege of building 1GB blocks doesn't exist in Bitcoin world. If you can do that, there will be always plenty of competitors who can do the same. It's the same as with CPU/GPU/ASIC/etc. Mining gets more and more expensive, but competition is always there. 
Nobody in 2011 could build 1MB blocks *exclusively* - that's why nobody tried, and similarly there's no 1GB exclusive entitlement today. 
You're essentially retelling the mainstream economic theory of "natural monopoly" - that market inevitably tends to monopolization due to high entry costs. In reality monopolization is always the result of non-economic regulatory barriers which do not exist on Bitcoin market.

It is incredibly centralized at the side of payment processors. What is easier to run - a full node (even a heavy one), or a company like Coinbase?
We're not trying to squeeze full nodes into smartphones, because any decentralization comes at cost. I don't think we need artificial limits to find an optimal balance. Technological progress never stops, it will partially compensate for future growth of blocks. 
Besides, what are the alternatives? Payment channels on top of Bitcoin? I'm not against them, but they should be only created naturally, and not because of restrictions. Limiting growth will cause nothing but problems. So, we do not need limits in any case. 
EDIT: I have just realized it: Keeping the limit will not bring new payment processors. Instead, new payment processors should naturally reduce the growth of blockchain.

You're avoiding direct questions because you have no answers to them, don't you see? How many nodes is sufficient? Who is "you"?


When you have a limit, 99% of users can't use blockchain no matter how much money they have. Also a modern PC is a datacenter 15 years ago. Also, they're more than half a million datacenters on the planet today. I guess we should make a law to shrink them, for the sake of decentralization.
Limiting transactions won't force users to run more nodes than we have today, so you've already failed at that. But it will prevent new users from joining the network, by making owning a node pointless.

No-no, this debate goes around the claim "nodes dropping is bad"! That leads to the question how many is enough. You can't now just avoid it by saying it's irrelevant. If it's irrelevant, then "too few nodes" is an outright logical fallacy. Which is my point exactly.


But not everyone wants that. If "you" means "whoever wants", then any number of nodes at a moment is sufficient, as long as users are okay with it.

Let me say it again: I'm not against LN or any other 2nd layer imaginable. I actually believe in future most of the transactions will go through a 2nd layer. But it should come naturally. I'm against making LN the only option.

No kidding, since no formula exists to prove that 1MB is the golden block size, the only reasoning for sticking to it is "the smaller is better". And that's what they actually say. Bigger is worse, so smaller is better.
But if smaller is always better, then 100KB is unconditionally better than 1MB and 1KB is better than 100KB. Of course at this point it becomes obvious, how harmful can a limit be. With 1KB or 100KB cap set 6 years ago, Bitcoin would never become what it is today, there wouldn't be any "settlement layer" for sure. 
But it's absolutely the same for 1MB or any other limit put in the way of growth. It baffles me every time some people claim some "technical" or "scientific" reasons for a random number.

It did happen, you can see when the price is growing, node count also grows, like [now]( 
Also nodes have dropped after the price has crashed from 1100 back in [2013](
The point is, network effect contributes to the price, and higher price attracts nodes. But the price also depends on BTC inflation. When BTC supply grows faster than the adoption, price crashes and nodes quit. In a long run the amount of coins is limited, while the amount of users on the blockchain isn't (unless we limit it). Limiting the network effect limits the price and the number of nodes. 
Also, the idea that small blocks make a decentralized cryptocurrency is 100% refuted by the history. All the altcoins have tiny blocks, and their nodes are also dropping despite that. Which means, it's not the size causing it.
I hear all the time that big blocks "hurt decentralization", but nobody ever explained how small blocks will help it. How do you get new nodes when we can't have new users. The limit on transactions aims to preserve the existing number of nodes by preventing new ones from joining the network. I mean, what is the point of running a node, if you can't send your transactions because of the limit? It's like hoping to have more torrent seeders by not allowing more users to download.

3000 nodes was the number of full, validating, active nodes. There were about 20000 total nodes in 2012, before the 2013 bubble. Then they jumped in the late 2013, then crashed again, along with the price. What we see is the downtrend from the biggest bubble. And I repeat, nodes have stabilized when the price stabilized. 
There was also a similar node bubble in 2011 at the time of 2011 price bubble, when nodes temporarily rose to about 60000, and later went down, another crappy [chart]( for you.
There were never ever hundreds of even tens of thousands "full nodes", okay? If you still insist on it, you're just dumb. I know your source for that number, and it has been refuted by the source itself. Late in 2013 bitnodes.io made a mistake and counted nodes incorrectly, which they realized and changed the algorithm. That gave you the impression of drastic node reduction from hundreds of thousands to thousands, which never actually happened.
["The early December 2013 network snapshots, i.e. with over 100k nodes, are not valid as the crawler at that time took several hours just to complete one full network snapshot and it includes all nodes from addr responses which can be faked or likely stale. Those snapshots were linked to from getaddr.bitnodes.io/SNAPSHOT_NUMBER/ which have been removed since. With the new crawler released in late Dec 2013, the crawl time was brought down significantly down to sub 5 minutes with considerably good churn rate. I use the churn rate to measure how good a network snapshot is. A value of 0 implies the network snapshot was taken instantly but of course that's not possible. At the moment, we are seeing a typical churn rate of 30+:"](

You can't prove that. 


That's a blatant nonsense. If that's were true, we'd have a negative number of nodes. 
Where do you think new nodes come from? You didn't answer that. It sounds like they just preexist so all we can do is to try to keep them from disappearing. If that's the case, limiting transactions won't help anyway. 
The fact is the price went downwards most of the time, so nodes were following. 
You also can't explain why altcoin nodes were dropping at the same time despite their tiny blocks.

Newsflash. He demands a bartender job. The same way miners demand the block space. 


There was no rule to mine blocks exactly 10kb, 20kb, 50kb, 100kb, 300kb size, miners chose those sizes by themselves according to theirs and users' demand combined. 
In conclusion, there was never unlimited demand for block space from the network, otherwise blocks would fill up immediately. In reality they grew gradually for six years. The limit was initially set 1000x higher than the actual demand, today you want to set the limit lower than the demand, which is the direct opposite of its original intention.

Satoshi gave Gavin access to the source code repository and the alert key. He didn't just "took it over".
For my first bitcoin project in 2010, I created a site that then became pretty famous called the Bitcoin Faucet. I was giving away five bitcoins to anyone who went there. I started to submit code to Satoshi to improve the core system. Over time he trusted my judgment on the code I wrote. And eventually, he pulled a fast one on me because he asked me if it’d be OK if he put my email address on the bitcoin homepage, and I said yes, not realizing that when he put my email address there, he’d take his away. I was the person everyone would email when they wanted to know about bitcoin. Satoshi started stepping back as leader of project and pushing me forward as the leader of the project.

Price goes down most of the time. I see it's not a popular theory, but it occurs to me people are ignoring the effect of the price. 
The number of nodes has jumped in the late 2013 alongside with the biggest bubble in Bitcoin history. And the price has been mostly going down since then. Which makes it look like nodes are only declining. But we can see nodes have stabilized when the price  stabilized, for the last year - despite the fact that blocks are still growing more than ever.

The existence of causation should be proven first, but it is widely accepted as "obvious" without any actual research. 
The reason for that is a) unavailability of reliable data until recently and b) published incorrect data from bitnodes.io for 2013.
["The early December 2013 network snapshots, i.e. with over 100k nodes, are not valid as the crawler at that time took several hours just to complete one full network snapshot and it includes all nodes from addr responses which can be faked or likely stale.

The fact is there was a node count bubble in dec 2013 at the time of the biggest price bubble. But it wasn't as high as believed and the drop isn't that big (about 40k total nodes today, 7k full nodes from bitnodes.io). The price was mostly crashing ever since and nodes were following. Nodes have stabilized when the price stabilized. 
There was a similar node bubble in 2011, which also ended with [decline]( , with 20k total nodes in 2011-2012 (hard to tell more certainly) and they have recovered in 2013. I believe if we see a mooning price again, nodes will skyrocket as well, as they did in 2013.

If 2Mb threatens to increase centralization, then 1mb threatens to increase centralization, 500kb or 300kb threaten to increase centralization, and any given number threatens to increase centralization... But if we follow that logic, we have to reduce blocks to 100KB or better 1kb. Which obviously threatens to kill Bitcoin value - and increase centralization, since Bitcoin was more centralized when less people used it. There's no rational reasoning behind keeping 1MB hard limit, only blind emotions and popular economic fallacies (which Bitcoin was intended to disprove).

I'll answer because think you're actually believe this, since I'm familiar with these perpetuated misconceptions that have been debunked numerous times.


Bitcoin needs wide adoption in order to keep it ungovernable, like the internet today. It can only be small if nobody uses it. Litecoin is more easily governable because it's small, and it's dying because it's small. 
Keeping Bitcoin small means it will die, like Usenet. It was very small it died from being small. Internet is big, servers are big, and there are hundreds of thousands of them, and no government can shut down internet. 


That's evidently false, the need for more transaction capacity is obvious, and the demand for them is still growing. In a few years we will need more than 4M. Segwit is a minor increase that poses high risks which not worth the effort. 


That's an ignorant anti-economic absurdity. The fee market existed and was fully functional for years, long before blocks were close to full. There's no way artificial restrictions are good for any market. Restricting the market only leads to cartelization and limited competition.
It's bad for user experience, it stops adoption and endangers Bitcoin's only utility, while Bitcoin is still small and fragile. 


This is a non-sequitur. Hardforks become more dangerous later when the market becomes bigger. So if they are dangerous it's better to have a fork in advance, when we already know it's needed, not later when it's more dangerous. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 19:20:50

I've read it and there's nothing new there. The incentive is fees they are able to collect. Miners can choose which transactions to include in a block, like they always did. They can ignore transactions with a fee lower than required to pay for electricity. 
Just because there's no restriction, doesn't mean blocks will be infinite in size. Blocks will be whatever size a miner decides. Like today, not all blocks are 1M, some blocks are still 3-4kb. 


There's a contradiction: if miners don't mine, then there's no infinite amount of transactions.

You're not answering the question. It seems you're not even seeing it. How did you decide which limit is appropriate? The fees are different with 250kb limit, 1mb, 20mb. The "trivial" cases will be different for different limits. What makes you think you know where the line should be drawn? Maybe we should keep the 100kb with the same logic if limits are so good for Bitcoin? Hell, why not 10kb? It will help Bitcoin! 


You're just not listening. It fails not because it's popular, but because of inability to fulfill demand. The equilibrium you're taking about means most people stop using it because they just can't. Paying higher price to use it? What makes you think you know at what price, at what limit Bitcoin is still attractive to use? Will it survive ANY limit? 10kb? 1kb? Because that's exactly what you're saying essentially. Of course the market will sort things out: it will deem Bitcoin useless.

You know what, you're right but you're still wrong. I wasn't reading carefully, but I'm still correct because it's essentially the same. 
The paper assumes that without the limit all transactions will be processed at little to no cost, so the miners profits will be insufficient. Which is essentially the same anti-economic myth of "predatory pricing" and "race to the bottom" in a new pseudo-scientific cover. 
The PDF assumes there'll be not enough fees for the miners so for some weird reason they resort to some dirty and totally unreliable tricks (assuming everyone will be doing them). Instead of just fucking raising the fees. 
If the situation described (next block fees are insufficient) happens on a regular basis, then it's predictable and can be addressed with simply reducing the number of txs processed by raising the fees. 
I repeat: no limits doesn't mean "infinite blocks". Miners individually decide for themselves, what block size is profitable for them with what fees. Miners can keep some reasonable backlog of transactions in the mempool. 
Yes, there will be competition, but it will not reduce fees below the cost. It just can't. The market doesn't work like that.

Totally different things, supply of Bitcoin is infinite, and transactions depend on physical hardware. 
If the cost is negligible then miners expenses are negligible and there's no problem at all. But that's not true anyway, adding transactions requires paying for hardware, electricity, bandwidth. 


Doesn't matter because he's only shooting himself in the foot. Forking is risky and he can't rely on everyone doing the same, like the paper assumes. He'll just fork himself off or will diminish value of the fees. Simply raising the fees is more rational strategy. 


**Nobody** except miners can add transactions to the block, so nobody can create infinite supply of transactions that will drive the prices to zero.

If you really wanted the consensus, you could just agree to the upgrade. But the reason why there's no consent is because you are not consenting. So it's not the consent that bothers you, but something else.
Anyway, without consent change is just not possible. Any fork, no matter how it goes, will be de facto the result of consent of all users.


"Determined" the same way citizens vote for new government in hope of changing monetary policy. It's not what Bitcoin was created for. 
The "block size limit" taking effect makes it impossible for nearly all users to determine transaction production, except for a small group who thinks they know what's better for others. 
Since the beginning how many transactions there are was determined in a decentralized way. Hitting the limit radically changes that, moving the decision making from the decentralized network into the hands of a small group of individuals. If that successfully passes, it will make it easier to centralize other things as well.

Mining equipment is physical hardware. I don't understand what you're trying to say. Hardware has cost. The supply of transactions are limited by hardware, therefore transactions will have fees. 


Read the paper again: *"if all other miners follow the heuristic of mining on the block they heard about first in the case of a 1-block fork, then forking is ineffective, and Option One is clearly superior. On the other hand, since other miners are rational, perhaps they will choose to build on the fork instead of the older block"* 
He's not tempted because it's risky and stupid, he will be orphaned. "Miner sees no more transaction in the mempool" is a false assumption: miners can include fewer transactions in blocks and raise the fees so that mempool is never empty instead of attempting this unreliable trick. One or two may try it if they are completely crazy, but even in this case nobody will follow them.


Your non-mining node isn't needed to process a block and is irrelevant for the discussion. The paper only mentions miners costs. 
Miners can cover their costs by increasing fees, reducing blocks, increasing mempool, nobody else can stop them from doing that. 


And yet it never happened, because it's impossible financially.

"The network" did not order miners to mine blocks of a specific size until recently, they choose it themselves according to their own demand combined with demand from users:
A user wants to transact some money, miner wants to send a block of a size he chooses, they both constitute the combined network demand for block space.

No that's factually incorrect. Just like the price, nodes went up in 2013 and down after the bubble. Bitcoin has more nodes today than in 2012 (look at the numbers below), despite having drastically bigger blocks. Another fact: when the price has stabilized, since spring 2015, node count has stabilized as well, despite blocks growing bigger than ever, you can it see on charts. It directly refutes your theory. 


That's a myth, you're confusing total number of nodes with listening nodes. There were never tens of thousands listening nodes, and there are about 40k total nodes now. 
[July 2011]( ~40000 total nodes
[May 2012]( "there are now less than 3000 listening hosts"
[May 2012]( "it shows a number slightly less than 20K" (total nodes)
[Feb 2014]( 9208 listening nodes
[July 2014]( 7572 listening nodes
The huge 2013 bubble was reflected in a node count bump. Every significant price movement reflects in the number of nodes.


Your anecdotes are statistically irrelevant, sorry.


It's irrelevant how they are described, most outsiders still think the same about Bitcoin. It seems you don't get it. According to your theory node count is determined by block size, and smaller block size brings more nodes. If your theory doesn't work for alts, what makes you think it's true for Bitcoin? 
Look at the chart again closely  The graphs are moving similarly. There's a common reason behind that, and it's clearly not the block size.
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:11:38
Sorry, this is stupid, really stupid. Miners can charge sufficient fees regardless of any block limit. Which is proven by the fact they have been doing that for years. 
There's no infinite amount of transactions, because miners determine how many transactions they include in a block, and what fee is required.

@_date: 2017-03-03 00:19:15
There's no scenario in which this is not stupid. You're assuming fees have constant value, so it's profitable for a miner to steal them at any cost. This is a false assumption. Fees themselves worth nothing. They are only valuable as long as blockchain is working and transactions are passing through. Destroying the value of his own fees is never profitable for a miner who invested millions. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 18:04:50


To keep? That's the plan - to keep old nodes by preventing new ones from joining?
How about - to get more new nodes? You think even if we shrink block to 100kb, we'll have more nodes? No, we'll have less. Any block limit won't make running a node more attractive than it is now. Negative reinforcement doesn't work even with dogs. Besides, the assumption that node count depends on block size is a misconception. They're not even correlated statistically.

No it's not possible to repay mining costs without processing transactions. I'm starting to think you don't understand what Bitcoin is about. It's about transactions. There are no coins, only transactions. 
Blocks have grown from 0 to 1MB since 2010, by your logic it's a waste of resources, but in reality it Bitcoin's value has grown. 


You don't have to run a node, Bitcoin will do fine without you. If miners process transactions, it's only because someone else accepts them, who values them and values blocks with higher amount of transactions.
Bending Bitcoin to the needs of some specific individuals, such as you, means it's not decentralized anymore.
If too many nodes will be quitting because of bandwidth requirements, it will affect Bitcoin value, and miners will have to reduce blocks to keep their profits.  So it's impossible for a miner to profit from high blocks without benefiting the whole network.

"4,000 Bitcoin nodes were tested"
I'm not saying the conclusions are wrong, but focusing on preserving existing nodes (and/or miners) instead of attracting more new ones is the way towards centralization. 
It's the equivalent of import tariffs imposed on consumers to protect a privileged limited group of existing manufacturers at the cost of the economy. It doesn't allow for more competition, but leads to monopolization and cartelization instead. Anti-trust regulation always results in more monopolies.

That's another nonsense. No hard limit doesn't mean no limits. Miners are setting limits according to resources they have. 
Does he really think miners are that stupid to produce blocks bigger than they can handle or bigger than Bitcoin can handle? "Without guberment we all gonna die!"

Because miners do not produce money. "Money supply" isn't a scarce resource, it can be created in infinite quantities out of thin air. It doesn't require more resource to create more money. 


Miners can charge fees, they don't need someone telling them what size blocks they should generate. 
The reason why theye weren't charging fees until recently is because they didn't need them yet (block reward is enough to cover the costs), not because they couldn't. Actually, they were already charging fees, the fees just were not significant compared to the block reward.
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:09:46
Nothing of what you're saying implies that limiting Bitcoin growth would help decentralization. The limit would decrease it further by limiting profits for new miners. 
It's no different from imposing any other production quota on the market. E.g. if restaurants aren't allowed to sell more than 3 burgers per day, such a rule would kill most of them and would only benefit a tiny number of the biggest ones. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:35:48
Lower costs means nothing if profits are low. Litecoin with 1kb blocks is more centralized than Bitcoin. "Large" or "small" miners means nothing for decentralization. 
Larger blocks mean higher usage and thus higher value and higher profits and more new miners entering the market, as it happened before. 
Also larger blocks will help miners outside of China by reducing the power of the Chinese miners. It's very well known that they are against the increase because of that.

Please, stop with the DOOOM. You're completely out of touch with reality. Blocks have been growing constantly since the beginning of Bitcoin. It's the reason for its wide popularity. If blocks weren't growing we'd still have 1kb-byte blocks, Bitcoin would be just as dead as most alcoins are.

@_date: 2016-06-26 11:17:14


It's virtually impossible in a free market. Mining pools do not control their miners. The bigger Bitcoin is, the more diverse mining power it attracts, the lower probability of mining centralization. Limiting Bitcoin's value, on the other hand is a straight path to centralization by kicking out miners. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:54:48


Most of which people? 8GB is 33k transactions every second, or 2.8 billion transactions daily, which is over 10 times more than average VISA level. BTC worth $1mln, mining is insanely profitable, there are millions of diverse miners. 
Here's an example: running a datacenter today requires tens of gigabits of bandwidth. There are about [8 millions of datacenters]( in the world today. Limiting their traffic to 10Mbit/s would kill 99% of them. 


It's the opposite, higher usage increases Bitcoin value and mining profitability, and attracts an increasing number of miners. 
What killed GHash.io, small blocks? No, the rising price that comes with increasing transaction volume. 


Bitcoin has more nodes than any other cryptocurrency, despite having the biggest blocks. Actually, it's because of the biggest blocks. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:46:07


Actually, it never happened. Pools have no control over their miners. 


The limit on transactions is the limit on Bitcoin's value, because its value comes from utility, from the network effect.


Blocks are growing because more users are using Bitcoin for sending money. Which causes price to grow and directly benefits everyone. Limiting the growth only benefits the biggest farms and encourages centralization.  
It's a very well known economic phenomenon. Production quotas kill competition and create cartels. 
You should read about the National Raisin Reserve. It's a government agency that decides how much raisins is allowed to grow each year. It hurts small producers and has turned farmers into a cartel. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:05:13
This is a good question. But these limits are quite opposite. 
Price equals demand / supply. For Bitcoin to have value, its supply must be limited, and demand for it must be unrestricted. 
21mb is arbitrary indeed, because it doesn't matter what the total supply is, the only thing that matters that it can't be increased. 
Putting it another way: increasing money supply steals BTC value from Bitcoin users via inflation. Restricting transactions also steals BTC from users via fees. 
Or another way: Limited supply attracts users and miners to Bitcoin. Limited transactions keeps them away. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:00:15


Actually you do. A miner can't increase block supply infinitely because at some point it will reduce his revenues and profits. And to increase them again he'll have to add more mining equipment. 
I repeat again, all required hardware costs, no matter what they are, naturally do limit the block size. 


By all other miners who are not out of their minds. Read the quote again. 
"if all other miners follow the heuristic of mining on the block they heard about first in the case of a 1-block fork, then forking is ineffective".


It's rational for McDonalds to poison his burgers to sell more today and destroy all his business tomorrow? 
No, it's more economically rational to just increase fees and reduce blocks instead of doing this stupid and dangerous gamble. The paper is wrong because it fails to realize that miners can do that with or without a block size limit. 


And miners can do exactly the same because they are also full nodes. You're moving the goalposts again, it has nothing to do with the mining fees and mining costs. 


And it's still your imagination, it's never happened. Because he needs longer time to recover from losses. 
Limiting the amount of transactions, on the other hand, ensures monopoly by preventing additional miners to enter the market, because there's simply no more room for them.

I've no idea who told you that. Nothing stops miners from charging fees for transactions, same way prices work on any other competitive market. They already were charging fees. Blocks aren't going to get gigabytes large just because there's no hard limit, any miner still has its own physical, technological limits.


How small? Why not 1kb then? Miners are there to ensure blocks aren't too big and the network is decentralized enough to keep their own coins safe. 


If it's arbitrary then it's guaranteed to harm Bitcoin the same way 1kb limit would harm it. 
Fact is that transaction limit IS censorship.

Ease of mining means nothing, what's crucial for mining is profitability. Peercoin and namecoin are very easy to mine. I don't see many miners doing it. Bitcoin is the most popular coin to mine. 
Larger blocks consist of higher number of transactions. Which literally represents higher usage. How can you not understand it? 
Hence altcoins have small blocks, because nobody uses them, and Bitcoin blocks are growing only because of growing usage. Without growing blocks, Bitcoin usage will stop growing. 
Chinese miners have cheap electricity, but slow internet. Larger blocks will become a disadvantage for them, they will be losing the block race to the miners outside of China, who have fast connections.

You must be kidding. This ridiculous dabate has been going on for over fraqing 5 years now. Satoshi himself has said in 2010 that the fork needs to be phased in in advance, to be performed safely. We're getting closer to the limit every day. It allows for spam attacks now, and they get easier to conduct every day. And now you're saying urgency is manufactured?


Stop with the LN, it's irrelevant here, it's an experimental feature based on centralized bank-like hubs that maybe gains some demand from the market. 
Bitcoin is blockchain transactions. You're free to implement anything on top of it, and if you believe it's good, then people will willingly use it. But trying to force 99% of potential users into it by artificial limit, deliberatelly replacing the existing true and tested mechanism with an untested new feature is pure crazyness. 
Even if LN works, it's impossible to predict the demand for it and the demand for blockchain transactions at any given point of time in future, so we the limit needs to be raised anyway. 


More Bitcoin transactions weaken decentralization? Seriously? Did 1MB weakened decentralization when blocks were less than 1KB back in 2009? Blocks have grown by factor 1000 since then. 
If "smaller is better", should we set 10KB limit? Hell, why not 1KB? Will it "strengthen decentralization"? 
"Weakens decentralization" is just a non-statement. It's purely subjective, only market decides if the network is decentralized and strong enough. It can't be even measured, since you don't know how many users can run nodes, but choose not to, as the network is perfectly safe at the moment. Growing number of users sending transactions is the proof Bitcoin is decentralized enough. 
There are zero factual evidences that "small" block size ensures decentralization, there is evidence of the opposite: altcoin tiny blocks don't help them, Bitcoin is the most decentralized currency with the biggest blocks. E.g. Litecoin nodes are in decline despite its 10Kb blocks.

Price = demand / supply. More demand, fixed supply = price up, econ 101.
BTC supply is not fixed yet, it's growing faster than adoption. Miners generate 25 BTC block reward every 10 minutes, or over 800k USD every day. It keeps the price down. Still, it's been pretty stable for the last several months, which shows the demand supports it. 


Bitcoin is being used when it allows to dodge government restrictions today, and because it holds the future promise of a money that cannot be stolen by inflation. That's all Bitcoin offers, store of wealth nobody can control. So, when people use Bitcoin despite its drawbacks, they assume Bitcoin works for them as promised. 
More transactions from more self-interested users is not a danger, it's a sign of Bitcoin being secure and decentralized enough to trust it with users' wealth. The market decides what is "decentralized", not central planners. 
Bitcoin cannot become centralized because of more users using it. They are using Bitcoin only as long as it's decentralized.


Using a wallet vs running a node is an individual choice. If neither is good enough for you, then you aren't using Bitcoin and don't contribute to the growth of block size. The market finds an equilibruim block size that every user is fine with. 


Exactly why it's better to make 1 hard fork now instead of forking every year in future, every time the demand spikes.

Every single user and miner should decide that for himself. To use a blockchain or LN or something else. To include transactions or not. If users en masse prefer blockchain transactions, and miners willingly accept them, then it imples Bitcoin is decentralized enough and blockchain transactions are secure enough.

You should lean mathematics, 1000000 is just as random. Give me the formula for the optimal block size, if you can calculate it. Don't bother, any your formula is based on your subjective judgments, and thus is random as well, for the whole market.
1kb is just as random as 1mb. 1kb limit in 2009 would be an almost equivalent of 1mb today. If 1kb can harm Bitcoin, then 1mb can as well, depending on the current adoption and demand for transactions at any given point of time.

It's obvious you have no idea what is money and what is value. Bitcoin as money is a store of value because coins are limited, and is a medium of exchange because its exchange is unlimited. If you want to alter the latter, i.e. limit usage, you may as well change the former, i.e. increase the supply.
1mb comes from developers, miners merely accepted it. No matter if we agree to limit ourselves, that number is still centrally dictated.
1 megabyte is a random number, it's quite absurdly to dispute that. It cannot be calculated, it's just decided subjectively by a person or a small group, which is why it's guaranteed to be incorrect for the whole market. It was set 6 years ago, when blocks were 10kb, to ensure Bitcoin has enough space to breath, now it's unrelated to the actual performance and only stays in place for historical reasons.
It's hilarious to say that a limit cannot harm Bitcoin. So let's limit transactions to 1kb, it will be so decentralized! Except that it won't, because nobody will use it anymore.

It seems people still can't grasp what nodes are what are they for. A full node serves the purpose of individual security for its holder. If you need to "incentivise" nodes, it means they are actually useless. But they aren't. 
What's more important, forcing users to pay all nodes only distorts incentives. Nodes can be trusted only if they provide data voluntarily, in anticipation for data from other nodes, for their own security.  
If you have to pay to any node, it means you can't trust them anymore, because they are likely motivated by some other motives than supporting security for themselves and thus for the network.
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:10:34
Yes, that's what raising the hard limit does: it allows block size to be determined dynamically by the market itself, according to supply and demand, miners and users.

This patch set introduces code that runs when a node is full and otherwise could not accept new connections. It labels and prioritises connections according to lists of IP ranges: if a high priority IP address connects and the node is full, it will disconnect a lower priority connection to make room. Currently Tor exits are labelled as being lower priority than regular IP addresses, as jamming attacks via Tor have been observed, and most users/merchants don't use it. In normal operation this new code will never run. If someone performs a DoS attack via Tor, then legitimate Tor users will get the existing behaviour of being unable to connect, but mobile and home users will still be able to use the network without disruption.

It will not exist because nobody will hold it. How are you going to buy anything with inflationary currency, when nobody accepts it?


Business risks, same with inflation. Besides, nobody would set wages in BTC until it settles. If we set wages in BTC, it implies BTC is steady and predictable. 


You will not have debts that awful, you aren't born with debts, you decide to take them only if it benefits you. Yes, probably people will take less loans and save more instead, but it's a good thing, no more credit bubbles, no more crashes, good for everyone. 


US isn't a person, it can't hate or love anything. Governments prefer inflation to steal people's money, people prefer deflation because it doesn't steal their savings. 
Predictable inflation doesn't help debtors - because it was already included in your debt's rate. I.e. if price inflation is 3%, you'll have to pay 6% interest, there's no benefit for you.

How can it be if the bandwidth consumption is still much less than Bitcoin?  If you look at the charts, Doge and Ltc nodes have a similar declining trend, which means there's a common reason behind it, most likely just loss of interest and the falling price.

This is what users want, this is the only reason why Bitcoin gains popularity. If users send more transactions via Blockchain instead of PayPal or Visa, it implies Bitcoin gives them what they want, despite inconvenience, instability, risks. 
Smallblockers want to limit transactions, because their assumption is that users don't know what they want and our wise masters should take care for the rest of us for our own good.

There are no "big blockers", sizes of blocks should be determined by the market: by miners and users. If miners want to limit blocks, they should do that, like they already do. 
Mining profitability depends not on block size, but on the BTC value, which will eventually grow with more users using Bitcoin, according to the supply and demand law. 
What users want they express by voting with their feet and their dollars. I'm assuming that if they use Bitcoin with X block size it's only because the network is decentralized and safe enough. 
I trust users and miners to make their own decisions, I believe that market knows more than central planners, this is the only reason why I'm into Bitcoin. If free market doesn't work, then maybe we should go back to the Federal Reserve.

No, it's only maximum accepted size. The current 1MB limit existed for 5 years, blocks were much smaller until recently and sometimes even reduced in size. The actual average block size reflects growing demand for Bitcoin

The block reward per se worth nothing. It's the price users are willing to pay for it is what matters. As I already explained, maximizing that price isn't altruism, because if users can't transact their money, the block reward costs zero, and if they are happy, it can cost millions. 


Not sure if I'm follow. Why a smaller-blocks-miner is a rogue miner? And fees for fewer transactions are already generally lower than for more. Miners maximize profits by finding an equilibrium block size between higher orphan rate and smaller fees. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:39:20
"Spam" is subjective, miners reject transactions if it's spam and doesn't pay proper fees. Otherwise it's not spam. It's like "spamming" McDonalds by buying thousands of hamburgers.

So let's make it clear: you do want 1MB forever, so stop lying you're not. 
A hard fork is dangerous indeed, and it can't be avoided, regardless of what you want. Which is why it's preferable to perform it as soon as possible and as rarely as possible. 


Your thoughts and dreams are irrelevant. It's another system that is intended to replace blockchain transactions in hope that it will be as good as the blockchain itself or even better. You're free to experiment with any sidechains, as long as there's no limit. But you want to artificially cripple the blockchain to push users onto your experimental, untested, unproven tool.


Nobody is forced to use the blockchain. But the limit does exactly that: it prevents users from using the blockchain. With 1MB limit, blockchain can only operate with a user sending, like, one transaction per year. But it won't, because nobody would trust such system. 


Well that's it, you're out of touch with reality. Nobody owns or controls the blockchain, if anything, we the users give it the value, we fill it with our transactions, we run nodes and farms, we buy and sell coins. Nobody will be asking your permission to upgrade, so you can keep your smallcoin to yourself.

Actually, it's not. Just because users can't use blockchain because of limits doesn't mean they automatically will run to LN. It's a dangerous delusion. Most probably they will just quit Bitcoin for another option.

You're baselessly assuming users will want to use LN instead of blockchain directly. But if they will, then block limit is useless. And if they won't, then it's damaging. 
You can't predict growth of demand, especially an unexpected one. When 1MB was set, average blocks were 10KB. I gueess we should been making a hard fork every year. "Hey, we'll be ok with 50KB limit by end of year!".

1. Long term wider usage of Bitcoin will lead to deflation, not inflation, simply because its quantity is strictly limited. 
Inflation may *temporarily* result in large volumes, when people are massively dropping their coins. But in this case the volume will quickly reduce (nobody uses Bitcoin anymore), and the blocks will shrink well.
2. Er... More businesses willingly accepting Bitcoin means more demand for Bitcoin. Higher demand + fixed supply = growing price. I'm not sure how did you make inflation out of this.

Are you backpedaling now?
You can raise your bid. You know your current bid. There are plenty of ways to know what others are paying, even here on reddit. We can freely communicate with miners, they just don't want to communicate, because *miners don't care about fees*. 
You don't decide what is best or poor. Poor and ridiculous are subjective. Best is subjective. Market works best when its participants, including merchants in the first place, believe that it works best. Miners can set any fees and communicate with anyone, they prefer to ignore fees because to them the business works best as it is for now. And it won't likely to change as long as the block reward is sufficient. Or until they decide that backlog affects the BTC price.

Besides, the attack itself represents growing interest for Bitcoin (which counteracts the slight inconvenience). It may seem counter-intuitive, but noone would spend thousands of $$$ to attack a currency nobody is interested in.

I'd say stupidity, but that wouldn't be constructive. 
Every person believes in free market and Austrian economics, even if he refuses to admit that. Since people are born with free will, nobody wants to be controlled and regulated, and Bitcoin gives them freedom they inherently aim for.
While everyone wants freedom for himself, most don't want it for others. And so they invent theories to justify that. What they fail to understand is that it can't work. By enslaving others you eventually enslave yourself and vice versa. That's the truth that is extremely difficult to grasp.

They are the same. You're missing that if Bitcoin is being used, it's because there's a demand for it. You can't pay with Bitcoin if nobody accepts it. E.g. USD is the most widely used currency and is the most stable one. 
Do you even understand why Bitcoin is deflationary? Or are you denying that? 
Without deflation Bitcoin will not not overcome USD, so if you don't believe in future deflation, then Bitcoin will eventually just die. 


So many fallacies. 
Email and internet in general are infinitely more decentralized today than in 1985, inspite of (or thanks to) being bigger. You can control gmail, but nobody can control email or internet, but it was quite easy to do 30 years ago because it was small. Internet overthrows tyranic governments, not the other way around. 
If you think nodes are redundand, then nothing can force users to run more useless nodes. But they aren't useless, they ensure safety of users' money, for those who run them.
Bitcoin is not a corporation that maintains some number of nodes. Individual users have them for their own security. You don't get to decide how many nodes there should be. You can't force them (us) to run more nodes by making blocks smaller by kicking users (us!) out of the blockchain by a limit. Tiny blocks don't help Litecoin to maintain their node count, so your theory isn't aligned with reality. 
Blocks are the real time voting mechanism: they get filled with users' transactions in real time. Miners also vote by choosing an appropriate block size to generate. [Block size ]( changes every 10 minutes, it even reduces. The idea that transaction volume cannot shink is just an overly optimistic assumption.


If you believe centralizatioin is efficient, then everything is useless. But it's not. You realize what's the goal of decentralization? It's a measure of keeping users's money safe. If Bitcoin is not decentralized, then it's inherently *worse* than PayPal/VISA/USD. Bitcoin is simply not appealing if it's not decentralized. No mass exodus from Windows is the proof that Linux is only used by those who value decentralization. The fact that Linux doesn't become Windows proves my point, not yours.
Any danger to the network is reflected in price, it will drive whales and hordes of small users out of the blockchain and will automatically reduce blocks, while at the same time causing more users running nodes for safety of their own coins. Market ballances itself. 


First, it's a meaningless prediction. Forks don't occur by itself or by wish of devs, users decide it. 
Second, you want to keep 1MB forever? Raising the limit is inevitable, the only choice is to have one fork  now or numerous forks later, every time demand spikes, more and more dandgerous every time. Never raising the limit means killing Bitcoin while it's small.


It's anti-spam, it's optional and can be disabled. And it's not about XT at all. Give people better option to raise the limit if you have it. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:18:03


That's obvious.


That's incorrect. Efficiency cannot be measured in terms of expensiveness. Efficiency is value minus expenses. Value is subjective. The value of decentralization is protection from theft by inflation and by censorship. Decentralization is efficient because it allows users to save their wealth from theft. The higher Bitcoin value is, the more valuable  decentralization is for its users, who run their own nodes to protect their coins.

Number of nodes is growing when Bitcoin value is growing, when more people want to secure their savings, because they become more and more valuable. There's little to no point in having a node when you can't use it for your benefit. It's like hoping that people will seed more torrents if you restrict them from downloading.

No, miners need it in the first place. They can set their own limits. 
Like in politics, you're trying to push the regulation because "something has happened". It's a wrong way to go in the real world, it won't work in Bitcoin either. Market regulates itself, miners now have realized why they need to validate blocks and why they need to keep blocks small instead of skipping validation. 
This episode only proves a hardlimit is completely pointless - miners with big blocks punish themselves.

Mining is as safe as it's supposed to be, according to users who trust their money by sending 100000 transactions every day. In fact, it becomes safer every day.

Resubmitting is a way to increase the fee. 


Please stop with your random judgements. You don't listen: what is "efficient" or "absurd" is subjective. "Market price" does not equal "equilibrium tx fee". Miners don't care about equilibrium fees, because their full market price is the block reward. It's not absurd for miners, it's not absurd for users who still send 100.000 transactions every day, so it's not absurd at all. It has the very specific rational reason: the block reward is intended to pay for transactions at this point. 
Yes, if a gas station owner wound't care what you pay, and just lets you bid with others, that would be the market price. 


They don't demand "equilibrium fees" because they don't care about them. Are you saying they can't change the fees? That's absurd.

If Bitcoin usage grows by 50x, Bitcoin price will rise to 10-20k, mining will be booming, many new users and businesses will launch their nodes to secure their own transactions. If blocks get too big to handle, miners will set soft limits. The system balances itself.

"Redundancy", "efficiency", and "expensiveness" are purely subjective.

If you're assuming bigger blocks cause more profit, then by making bigger blocks you provoke others to raise their own limits. It's like a market price: if you can sell more by lowering the price, others will have to follow.

So, if miners don't want others making bigger blocks, they don't raise their own limits.

More importantly, there's no theory that can prove that 1MB or any other random number (e.g. "2MB by the end of the year") is the correct optimal limit at any given point of time. Smaller is not automatically better, which is obvious if you think about limiting blocks at 10 or 1KB.


Wow, such scientific. 
So instead of one hard fork, lets have them every year, during every boom, totally makes sense. Admitting that block size should be driven by the market demand, and still keep controlling it with a centrally planned limit is absurdly illogical. 


Another meaningless assertions. What is "large blocks", how much is "large", why 10x faster is okay, what about 5x or 2x? Or maybe 10x is not enough, and we should wait for 100x? Which tradeoffs are not acceptable, and at what cost?

Any central bank already has the power to limit creation of new money: by adjusting the base interest rate. And that's the reason for boom and bust cycles, not the evil private banks, who only follow limits set by a central bank.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Bitcoin takes the power of creating money out of the "public", aka government hands and gives it back to the public aka market. Bitcoin is the ultimate capitalism, Marx's worst nightmare.

WM/QIWI/Yandex are not digital currencies, they are just wrap-ups over the government-issued currency. Yandex is even owned (85%) by the government's Sberbank. 
They are centralized, so they have to follow so called anti-money laundering regulations. They are controlled by the government and your money can be confiscated any moment. They require personal identification for use (mandated by government). There was a case when the government has banned Yandex.Money donations to an opposition leader. 
This comparison is not even funny. "Unregulated" , you have no idea what are you talking about. 
Bitcoin is resilient and unreachable to government control.

Trusted third parties with side chains do not make Bitcoin centralized at all. They can help to perform faster transactions when it's really needed, while the core remains resilient. It is happening already, some wallets do that when you send money between two accounts within the same wallet system. Bitcoin doesn't need millions of transactions per second in its core.

The state already limits it: by adjusting the base interest rate. And it does it wrong all the time, because instead of limiting, the state sets the interest rate artificially low in order to "stimulate" the economy, and then blames non existing free market for another credit bubble.

I don't understand why does this need a test, when it is written in the policy. Also I don't see how it contradicts fractional reserve theory. Fractional reserve is creation of new credit out of nothing, while maintaining some fraction of it in reserves.
"According to the fractional reserve theory of banking, individual banks are mere financial intermediaries that cannot create money, but collectively they end up creating money through systemic interaction" - What? What is "collectively creating money through systemic interaction"? Indeed, all banks do that, so the total money supply is created collectively, and not by some individual bank.

Yes, they are. If another person gave you his phone by his will, if you only do with it what he allows, and he can take it back whenever he wants, then he has control over it, i.e. he owns it. Otherwise it is stolen by you and you are de facto the owner now.
If you control things according to the will of the owner, e.g. via attorney power, if you do what he says, then he still controls it.
If you own something "legally", on paper, but someone else in fact controls it against your will and nothing you can do about it, then it is stolen and your "ownership" is negligible. For example, if government can confiscate "your" property if you don't pay the property tax, then it's not really yours, but you're renting it, and the law doesn't reflect the reality. If you can't withdraw your money from bank account, or MtGox account, then you don't own them anymore.

In reality the "top coder" was just too dumb to use the recently introduced API, which wasn't even hidden:


Mr. Bodek had been using common "limit orders," which specify a price limit at which to buy or sell. Mr. Davidovich, according to Mr. Bodek, suggested that he instead use an order type called **Hide Not Slide, which Direct Edge had introduced in early 2009**, about the same time Trading Machines' performance started to suffer. **"Man I feel like an idiot."** Mr. Bodek emailed Mr. Davidovich several days later"
He should feel like an idiot, because it was even published in the news:






So much for conspiracy. And if he made "shit ton of money", then how come his company went bankrupt eventually? It seems that's the reason for this whole bullshit story: extorting a few bucks from the exchange using government powers, after he failed to earn them fairly.

If, say, nobody's investing and economy isn't growing, then there's no deflation. So the "problem" doesn't exist either way.

You're quoting like it "obviously" confirms your conclusion, but it only seems obvious to you because of your bias. 
It says give Ceasar what's his, but there's no statement that whatever Caesar asks belongs to him. It's just your assumption that because heavenly things belong to God, all earthly things belong to Ceasar. There's a clear reason why the coins could be Caesar's: only because they are issued by him, not because they are earthly or he demands them. Implying that everything worldly belong to Caesar would be a blatant blasphemy.
Caesar can demand anything - your wealth, your life, your worship.  But just as demanding your soul and devotion doesn't make them his, demanding taxes doesn't either.


To "worship" in its essential meaning is to value God's principles, the central of which is "love and respect thy neighbor as yourself", including - do not steal and do not even covet what's his. Not only by your actions, but even in your thoughts. There's no love to a neighbor without respecting his belongings.

They are wrong, because nobody ever "just saves" money. All money are saved for one and only goal: to spend later instead of spending right now. 
So, "spending later" doesn't mean "less jobs". It can be the opposite: saving more in order to invest more and create more jobs, according to real demand, not artificial demand enforced by government inflation.
Government doesn't get to know which moment of time is preferable for people to spend their money, now or later. Jobs created by forceful spending "now" will be wiped out when government will have to stop ~~stimulating~~ printing money.

This is only true in general, when monetary system is free. In our current system money is an enforced monopoly, so it is used constantly to forcefully redistribute wealth from money earners to others, according to the broken window theory: government breaks windows with inflation so that others can benefit - it's mostly banks and manufacturers. It's a pyramid with a central bank on top of it, private banks are lower, manufacturers who take out loans are even lower, and employers are in the bottom. The closer you are to the top - the higher your benefit is. I don't blame anyone for playing this game - people don't have a choice, it's the game itself to blame. Bitcoin aims to change that.

Merchants can either dump coins, or hold them. If they dump, they do that not as merchants. They would dump them anyway. 
But accepting coins creates upward pressure.

In a free market all voluntary deals are as fair as ever possible.
The price falling currently represents lack of demand and surplus of supply of bitcoins. 
That's a good thing, because the price must come all the way down to where it belongs according to usage in real trade, not just in inflated over-hyped speculative bubble. The 1200 bubble has played its role in promoting Bitcoin, now it's time for Bitcoin to show itself as a real money.

Just another communist in disguise. He's allegedly against the state, but he believes in every myth statism is based off of. Is that what so called "anarcho communism" is about? 
Here's the reality statists should learn from: MtGox is dead because there's no state to protect it. Ghash gets dissected every time it approaches 50%, because it's against interest of every miner, including ghash itself. "Natural monopolies" do not exist: there are dozens of competitors for every major player, looking for its every misstep, to use it as an opportunity to take its place. A company can remain big only as long as it's good for the market. 
Bitcoin itself is no immune to competition. 
Concentration of bitcoins among early adopters has occurred only because that's what was required for Bitcoin to succeed in a world where money is an absolute government monopoly. In other words, it's not because of "free market", but because we do not have free market, and we must react to the state's coercion. 
But concentration of btc is not a problem either. What can early holders do? Worst case scenario: spend all their bitcoins (assuming they haven't done this already). They can do that only once, they can't print more. Bitcoin goes down, temporarily, maybe gets replaced by more stable altcoin, problem solved.

I see a great misunderstanding on this topic among bitcoin community. 
In modern economy central bank is the bank that controls and issues all the money in the economy. It's a state monopoly, that's what makes it evil.
Bitcoin bank or any other private currency bank will control its own currency only. Open competition among banks and their currencies will keep them disciplined.
This is how free market works. Read "Denationalisation of Money" by Hayek.
 The whole point was to make a currency that can't loose its value, assuming that central bank is the main cause. Although this is partially true, we can see the other reason is volatility. Bitcoin needs some sort of central bank to stabilize its value. People need stable money. Instability prevents spending and slows down bitcoin adoption and development.

The crucial difference between gold and paper, the only important difference, is that paper amount is unlimited. It's not like gold has some magic abilities. Having gold as money is simply a way to limit government urge for unlimited counterfeiting. 
Krugman says "money is not a source of national prosperity" - **that's exactly the point, printing money doesn't make society to prosper**, and Keynes with Krugman believe otherwise - like printing more money makes more wealth out of thin air, that's the problem.
Of course gold standard is not the only way to limit an amount of money. Actually it's a wrong way, since government can abolish it any moment.
Demonopolization of money and open competition will have the same effect as gold standard. And that's what Bitcoin does.

Except that it's logically impossible to distinguish "personal possessions" from any other kinds of (personal) property. And it's physically impossible to "unrecognize" the concept of property without ceasing any basic human activity - I can't even walk, or even breathe freely if my legs and lungs are not mine only. 
Protecting my property is not an oppression. For me to protect my house, or my car, or my clothes, or myself, I'd have to hire a security guards to defend me and my possessions. 
If everything is common, then anyone can come and get my leg, or my children, or my house. 
When I protect my belongings, which I obtained via voluntary exchange, I'm not oppressing anyone.
State is not necessary for protecting peoples' property, there are private security companies in Detroit, when state police is not functioning (and their services are cheap):
If the state is rooted in a concept of a "personal property", then we're all doomed. But I don't believe that. In my opinion the existence of a state is based on people honestly believing the state is absolutely crucial. That's a fact: 99.9% of human population believe so. Just like 500 years ago people believed the crown and the king should and have all rights to rule the society. And today, just like 500 years ago, the key to changing the system is to change people's minds.
But the thing is: believing in a state is based on believing in a "common property". That's why the theory of a "stateless socialist society" is an oxymoron and always leads to a totalitarian state, like in Soviet Union. That's why I dislike any kinds of socialism.

Yes, like Marxist theory, which declares abolishing of the state eventually. Didn't go well in reality. In practice these theories either decay, either lead to an oppressive state. 
if I'm allowed to act voluntarily, then noone can stop me from owning a property, or to hire a worker using my savings. But if a person should obey your "theory", then a state is needed to force it. Prohibition of capitalism and private property is impossible without a force from a state.
A real life example is Kibbutzes - jewish communities based on a socialist principles. Due to economical problems and debt crises inherited to all socialist societies kibutzess have lost many members and most of them have turned to a usual capitalist and individualist principles.

So far I see two main drawbacks:
1. Limited, one-sided anonymity. I don't feel comfortable seeing all transactions are known to everyone. You're anonymous as long as you don't running public business for example. Otherwise all your earnings and spendings are open to public. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but people do need choice.
2. Volatility. Say what you want, but people want stable money. Even if bitcoin will get less volatile in future, it will not be as stable as traditional currencies. Some kind of stabilizing mechanism has to be developed.

No economy means no goods produced. No goods produced means more money chasing less goods. Which means inflation. That's how free market regulates itself.
Also, people investing money will make more than those who hoard anyway, so the incentive is still here.

It's irrelevant who is paid with that 6%. 
Fed is a government institution. It was created by the government. Its monopoly is supported by the government. Its governance is appointed and fired by the government. It acts in accordance with government issued bills. 
What Greenspan saying is exactly the same I just said. Fed is a relatively independent government branch. The Congress actions cannot be overthrown by the President too, the Courts actions cannot be overthrown by the Congress. That doesn't mean the Congress and the Courts are private institutions. 


You either don't read or don't understand what I'm saying. I want less government centralization, not more. I fail to see how 500 million printed by the Congress to spend on Medicare or whatever would be better than money printed by Fed.

Physical characteristics of $ ensure it can be used as toilet paper, sure.
And, say, Youtube is not physical and cannot be used as other than a video hosting, so it has no intrinsic value? 
Electronic industry is 100 years old, so gold had no intrinsic value prior to XX century?  You know, demand for gold as jewelry is very subjective and can vanish very quckly. Besides, are you sure jewelry has intrinsic value? 
"Intrinsic value" is not "usefulness for something else", it's the value of thing "in itself". And money in general has value as a useful specific instrument. Yes, it can lose its value with time, but that's true for almost everything. 
Actually, absence of physical characteristics makes Bitcoin (in perspective) more valuable than gold: much easier to transport around the globe.

Marx didn't believe in totalitarian dictatorship either. 
The problem is not in theoretical intentions, but practical deeds. When government has the limitless ability to print money, it will do it. That's what monopoly does.
Also, the central idea of Keynes's theory is "supporting" economy with government spending and credit expansion. He didn't realize that government spending **inevitably** leads to the deficit and inflation. And credit expansion has essentially the same effect as printing money.
Deflation is not the cause of depression, it's the effect of inflationary bubble (hint: numerous empirical evidences throughout recent history). You can't cure the disease by adding more medicine that has caused that disease. Because printing more money doesn't create any wealth out of thin air.

Truism is an obvious statement. I'm not asking what is natural rate, I don't see how your statements justify lowering nominal rates by Fed and Krugman advocaty for lowering rates.
Low rates weren't the **only** cause of housing "non-bubble" if that's what you're trying to say. There were other key ingredients:
1) Government's CRA forcing banks to issue risky mortgages.
1998, Clinton takes a credit for enforcing CRA:
2) Fannie and Freddie forcing the market to lower loan standards.
From 2001 paper:


favorable economic and demographic projections, we're in a position to hit 70 percent by the end of this decade, with over ten million new homeowners. To get there, **we have to keep bending financial markets** to serve the families buying the homes you build.”- Frank Raines, Chairman/CEO Fannie Mae1"


So, it was a huge government policy intended to "help" the economy by forcing and "ecouraging" the markets and people to buy as much houses as possible. Lower rates + CRA + Fannie &amp; Freddie. Each single component is bad enough by itself, all three in sum have lead to the worldwide disaster. That's what centrally planned economy does.
And Krugman is still a dumb bastard.

Saying Fed is not government because the President can't print money is as stupid as "Supreme Court is not the government, because the President can't judge people".

Or maybe police is be a private institution too, because it also has been granted the right of monopoly of violence.
Dude, don't send me to utube, I heard all these stupid arguments 1000 times already.

You don't realize that the reason why [deflationary] money deflates is the increased supply of goods along with the constant supply of money. 
In other words, your Bitcoins will not grow when the economy is not growing.
The idea of people not going to Starbucks today because it will cost less tomorrow even sounds silly, let alone it is disproved by everyday experience (iphone 5 will cost half in a year, should I wait?) 
What you're missing is that
a) People need money not for money per se, but to make their lives better by buying things. And 
b) Time is an extremely valuable resource. I'm not going to waste a precious year of my life without a thing that can make it better even if not waiting costs me some money. That's why people take out loans instead of saving and waiting.

No, on what they believe, that's what ideology is. 
Believing that "human greed" of society members harms society is socialism. 
Believing "greed is an issue" is an issue. Limiting human greed of many in favor of a few is what harms society. E.g. central banking system, like any other aspect of centrally-planned economy is about limiting human greed of many, that's why it's an issue.

Except that values or food and iron are also not direct. We eat not for the sake of eating, but to live and to do some valuable things. Same with iron. We build cars not for cars, but to drive somewhere, where we can do something valuable.


But the same is true for Bitcoin - expected profit of using Bitcoin is greater than not using (potentially). 
Problem with Bitcoin is that at the present moment it is only *potentially* valuable. Its value has not revealed itself yet. We know from experience that gold has been valuable for over 4000 years, that makes us sure it has some value in it. Gold has reputation, but its reputation is based on its properties.
Bitcoin has no reputation yet, but it has very similar properties - rarity, divisibility, and much better portability. Maybe it will not gain any reputation in future, maybe some its hidden flaws will get more obvious to public. Only time can tell.

That's not the kind of ownership you think of. Ownership implies governance. As I said, the governance board of Fed is appointed and fired by the President and the Congress. 
And anyway it's irrelevant who owns it, because government is an evil regardless of who "owns" it. I repeat, if you want money to be controlled by a "good" government, you came to the wrong place. 


You shouldn't be. You're contradicting yourself. You just said you want the government to control all money. And now you against the control of money? 
Like earlier you said Fed is printing too much money, then you want the Congress to print more cheap money? To benefit society, sure.
You don't know what you're talking about. 
Private money, like Bitcoin, is not controlled by the government, and not enforced by any government. So if you want the Congress of the President to control it - that will never happen.
Like Google is a private institution, hence it's not a monopoly, it is not enforced by government, it has a competitors and benefits all society. 
Police, like Fed, is a government institution. It's monopoly is supported by the government. Government is the source of all monopolies, including money monopoly.

It doesn't take conspiracy to make bad decisions.

So they created just another government monopoly - central bank, which eventually ended up printing money without limit to support government plans.
Basically it's a special case of socialism. Same way some guys in Russia 100 years ago have decided all manufacturing should be monopolized by government to "protect" people from evil capitalists, and all manufacturing has turned to crap, because that's what every monopoly does.

Government doesn't appoint and doesn't fire the governance boards of private institutions. And if Fed was private, it would have competitors. And of course, if Fed was private, the Congress could control it, like any private bank. 
So, no, Fed is government. And it's an evil exactly because it's a government.

Consumer pays ALL the taxes: every tax for a corporation is included in a price for the consumer. Import duties are payed by the consumer. Consumer suffers from monopolization caused by government interventions (to help the poor), like in medicine  
I'm not from US, but the same goes everywhere in the world.
If you still want government spendings, there's a way to fund public projects voluntarily, which works better then you can imagine: state lotteries

No,  you don't. You may accept whatever you want or even nothing. Only taxes and debts must be accepted in usd.

"Intrinsic value" is very fuzzy term. In its root essence it means "value of a thing for its own sake". If you think about it, virtually nothing is good for its own sake, most of the things we use for something else. 
Like gold. Gold can be used as a store of value, but we store a value not for value per se, but to buy something else. We can make jewelry of gold, but what is the intrinsic value of jewelry? It's just a shiny piece of metal. Beautiful? But the beauty is the most subjective thing. At the very moment people lose faith in gold - all its value will go to 0.
The only objective value gold has - is its properties - which is rarity, divisibility, portability. Bitcoin has the same properties plus its 100000 times more portable than gold.

Who should control the Internet? The Congress or the President? Nobody, free market competition between a private companies should. 
The same with money. Bitcoin might be not the only private currency on market as well. Any private money is ok as long as it's not enforced by government.
I was not defending Fed, I clearly said the opposite: Fed is an evil because it's a government agency. The article, on the contrary, is saying that *Fed is evil because it's not integrated into the Government*.
"JFK and Abraham Lincoln who used this power" - exactly, money printing by government is giving more power to the government. Government-issued currency becomes a "legal tender" - which means it's forced on a people. Free money for a government spendings means free power and robbery via inflation. 
Printing by Fed is bad, but printing by the President is worse. I want less bad, not more.

First means nothing on a long run if you don't suit people's needs. Same with marketing. Where's Nokia &amp; Motorola now? Where's Blackberry - coolest smartphone marketed by the US president?

Sure, they stimulated the housing market very well.

They don't understand that Fed is a government branch itself. It's relatively independent from the other branches, the same way the President, the Congress, and the Courts are independent from each other. 
Anyway, the Fed governance is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
What's more important, this sentence means that RT advocates "integration" of Fed into the government. To give the Congress a right to print money directly as much as it wants. To strengthen the government centralization. It would be even worse, much worse. 


And they defending the dictatorship regimes over the world. No wonder, Putin is afraid to be overthrown himself.
It's very wrong to have this hypocritical communist propaganda here. This crappy article is leading towards the direction opposite to the goals of Bitcoin community.

I see, you're talking about fractional reserve banking. That's another part of why central bank monopoly is evil. It's still the same currency, the other banks are operating under the control and protection of the central bank, and it controls the money creation by regulating interest rates and money multiplier.

Ask Litvinenko about the balance, ex-FSB officer bashing the Putin's system. Oh wait, he is dead.
Kremlin doesn't care about freedom of information. All media in Russia are controlled by Putin. Kicking USA and "capitalism" is all they care about.

Found something more interesting, Krugman asked Greenspan to create the housing bubble:


Stupid ideas can be really disastrous sometimes.
UPD Even more, in 2005 he acknowleged that the housing bubble could cause troubles:


That's the epitome of keynesian economics driven by the government money monopoly: from bubble to bubble, from one recession to another. And these dumb bastards blame "free market" for their deeds, every single fucking time!
UPD And one more quote from the Krugman's idol:


~ Keynes (1964), p. 322.

"Russia Today" is a Kremlin propaganda channel. These hypocrites would bash Fed just because it's american, at the same time defending the Putin's right to money monopoly. Russian government is 100 times worse than american.

Don't be ridiculous. Putin is against internet privacy in his own country, destroys freedom of speech, spies on his own citizens, that's the results.

That's what I thought. Then he has nothing to do with this article.


No, you want bigger government controlling all the money, that's what the article says, that's what you said many times. 
Or you just don't know what you're talking about.

That's your imagination, what you said is obvious. Socialists just don't realize their theories are self contradictory (and so called "social anarchism" is no exception), even after it was explicitly demonstrated by history numerous times. 
Speaking of history, Lenin's "April theses" was considered "anarchist" by contemporeries, and Marx theory declared the abolishing of the state eventually. How did it go in reality? The most oppressing state in human history.
You couldn't even comment on Rousseaou's "social contract", a theoretical base for any government force. That's not "view", that's pure fact.

Government money is a pyramid scheme: 
Government sits on top of a printing pyramid, gains immediate profit by issuing new empty paper, which goes down the pyramid from the government through a banks to a manufacturers and employees, leaving the latter robbed via inflation. The lower you sit in this pyramid, the more painful it is for you.

By "requiring" you mean "forcing". Between two currencies - one has been forced, and one has been chosen voluntarily - which one you think has better value?

Doesn't matter how well it's written if it's stupid. 
Hard to find? Today's dollar lost 80% of its value since 1973, even according to the government statistics, decent economist should've known this.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy. Broad use, not government, is what makes a currency stable, and for Bitcoin it's only a matter of time. 
Government only debases currency. UK government couldn't keep UK Pound from falling in 1992 when people were getting rid of it.

There's really no point in artificially pushing bitcoin, it will do more harm than good. Either it will be adopted as a useful instrument or not. If it's not good enough for people, nothing will change that. If it is, they'll find out.

So you're really discussing with a voices in your head?
Why am I a hypocrite? How is despising Putin pro-government propaganda makes me a hypocrite?
