You gotta be able to take personal insults when you're talking about finances? Who knew? Imo pink tye dude was out of line and very rude. He didn't say anything about bitcoin, he just insulted the other guy's career.

Already done. Come back when you can have a conversation with someone you disagree with.

I'm gonna be completely honest, I know a lot more about linguistics than I do about cryptocurrency. I probably shouldn't have said anything in the first place, and not having a good response, I thought I could see myself out the easy way. I didn't expect you to rephrase. You called my bluff and now I fold.

Definitions change over time. Nothing like cryptocurrency has ever existed before, so of course nobody would think to include it in the definition of commodity.

Still dropping friendo.

Best time to transfer is tomorrow or Monday I think.

I prefer twitch.tv/twitchplayscrypto

Very true. No hard feelings either way, I didn't have much to base my guess on to begin with.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:32:38
Yeah that's called being willfully obtuse.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:09:47
See me in 2-3 days.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:08:33
Wait for stabilization. If it stops going down for several (5+) hours straight it'll be safe to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:48:53
It held steady at $6600 for a few hours yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:00:02
$7000 today.

Everyone holding btc will tell you to buy, because they want to stop the dip. You'll probably just get biased answers. I don't have btc but if it gets down to $5500 I'll definitely buy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:29:39
Very helpful.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:38:47
It hit $5519 earlier today.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:53:16
It'll recover. Might take some time or it might not but btc isn't dead. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:07:29
He got out when he doubled, paid off the house and put the rest in savings. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:53:54
Buying at $5500, see you there.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:29:53
Not quite. I mean, maybe. If it doesn't stabilize at $5500 I'd start worrying, but that was my original prediction when it first went below $7000.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:32:21
Not yet. Wait for the stabilization. It's still dropping pretty steadily.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:30:35
Wow, that's kinda extreme. Mind clarifying why you think that?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:50:58
Wait for $5500 ;)
