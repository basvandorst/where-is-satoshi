I don't think that's accurate. I heard that every trade is also being taxed now &amp; I'm not a happy camper.

I'm saying that every trade transaction from coin to coin will be taxed. I already understand the concept of selling it back to your bank for fiat will be taxed, it's just now this new bill is after the extras.

I appreciate that a lot! Just to be on the safe side I'm still going to provide my CPA this tax season with as much of my orders as possible that I can trackback from last year. 
On another note I spoke with my financial advisor recently &amp; was told that the IRS is currently auditing investors who performed $20k one-time transactions dating back from 13'-15'. So I'm not really worried as much, but just lightweight upset that the idea of trading coin for coin can actually be a taxable event. Other than that, keep the rest of us in the loop. Right on again!

They also mentioned taxing on all types of trading begins on the Jan 1st 2018. So all the trades I made for this year won't count right? Tbh I didn't even profit that much because I only bought in a small amount of BTC.

So if I trade my Bitcoin from coin to coin &amp; even store it, I wouldn't have to pay for any of those trades? If I sell it back to my bank, then I pay taxes on those gains, correct?
