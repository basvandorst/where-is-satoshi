WTF! I was pretty sure Mark Karpeles is a bad guy even though that's the point they are trying to hide this fact

Imagine if every merchant that took Paypal was automatically set up to also take Bitcoin by default.
Imagination of this guy is very impressive.

Does it mean that after they are going to accept bitcoins you are going to donate wiki?

It is the best week for BTC cause it's best time to buy it. The price will never be so low.  Though there's a lot of noise about MtGox and their plans. I think after this there will be only positive articles and no more news about attacks.

Only few people can benefit from bitcoin. Bitcoin has nothing to offer to the average person.

I can dump some old staff and get some cheap btc!

That's so funny. Never thought about such possibility before. But this "face to face" meeting is really face to face. I have another question - "Do money warm you?"

 It's too difficult to create a new founfation it's not a deal of 1-2 days it's a difficult job and maybe the present foundation is not the best but still they are trying in all their might and deserve our respect

haha , to be broke for internet access could it be worthwhile argument?
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:41:37
This is a better idea than MtGox's preferred solution

Very good article! 
I like their phrase “It’s completely Wild West! ”
It is and that's why I like it

John Law's wondering is right. BTC is our future and if today there is a little group of people who think so tomorrow it will be a crowd. And if you want to have benefits from it you should think about BTC right now, don't be late. Be first, be mainstream, and don't be late.

Don't you think it is too much for him to be removed by petition. I am not sure if it is really possible but can't agree with such solution about someone's life as no one is safe from mistakes.

Nice! Another fake news to make prices going up.Pls, give me a bitcoin if you believe it. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:03:56
Why is that so? Can't ordinary people use this situation to get benefits? Am I right that you're talking that it is usual situation as only chosen ones have benefits and other are in a hole?

They hold all your information for couple of years at least!
