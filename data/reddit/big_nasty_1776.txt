Some people just want advice on how bitcoin works.  Chill the fuck out, douchebag
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:30:59
I personally would, there is likely going to be a dip after the fork

What is bitcoin even used for besides buying games on steam and drugs on the deep web?  So yes, in order to be a legit currency it has to compete with fiat.  People are buying bitcoin to make a few bucks,  it makes me laugh at everyone in this sub who thinks they’re part of some monetary revolution.

Fuck that.  Bitcoin is a quick investment vehicle to make a few bucks.  It’s not actually going to become a legit currency any time soon, especially not in our lifetimes.

Our government actually becomes responsible and stops inflating the fuck out of our dollar
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:05:11
I would not recommend using bitcoin as a tax haven.

After the fork, nigga.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:32:19
Of course it is, it's gone up too fast in such a small time frame.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:13:50
It might be gettin to your head a little bit
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:33:43
How much is it going to dip?  I have no idea, if i could predict the price i would be rich by now.   One thing I've learned is to do your own research and trust your gut, don't listen to other people on what to do with your investments.

And?  Tell me when the general public starts using bitcoin as currency more than fiat.

I'm horrible at explaining, but gdax is an exchange owned by coinbase.  So go onto gdax and login using your coinbase information.  I would google a walk through on how to use gdax and limit orders, it's pretty simple but I don't have time to explain through text right now, i would just google it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:37:57
Do a limit order on gdax so you don't get fee'd
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:55:52
I keep my bitcoin coinbase/gdax.  Where should I keep it?
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:33:32
a small dip is occurring as we speak, now might be a good time to get in
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:47:40
I don't even know what private keys are, I'm still kind of new to this whole thing 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:14:01
Are you a fiat pleb?  What don't you get, fiat sucks.  That's the joke.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:58:31
any specific wallets you recommend? thanks
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:02:47
I didn't buy any coins tho, I'm just trying to transfer money into my USD wallet
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:03:11
