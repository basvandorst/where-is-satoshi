I think you undervalue the peace of mind of having money availabe if you should need it. Financial security is very important to live a stress free life.


Yeah sure. He was rich, but he choose to live like a poor man. I don't think you have to spend money to be rich. Being rich is about having money. Spending them is optional. Wouldn't you say Uncle Scrooge is rich, even if he re-uses his teabags? ;)

I've heard people say this, but it makes no sense to me. If i find 1kg gold, have I then not become richer until the moment I sell it for fiat?
In my view, you can still make money when your assets increase in value. I don't understand why exchanging it for fiat makes any difference

Thanks for your answer!
How can I control what chain I use? If I send BTC from electrum I assume I send "normal" btc (using original chain), but how do I send/control the altcoins? Do I have to download a wallet thats supports BU and operates in "blockchain 2", and if I send from that wallet I will not risk using my "original" btc, since they still are safe in chain 1?
It seems to me that I should sell the coin i do not believe in (unlimited), and that I'm losing out on not doing so. Is this correct, and if so what exchange should I use to sell the BU?
Thanks again for taking the time to answer my noob questions! &lt;3

Hey I use Electrum.


I understand this


But not this.
A hard fork is in my understanding when two different blockchains develop simultaneously, but what does this mean for me?
Do I get the same amount of say Bitcoin Unlimited as I have in regular bitcoins, and can I sell the altcoin?
And where does the altcoin from a hardfork appear? What happens if I just do nothing?

Yes we all know that, but that doesn't adress my question at all. It's not like i'm gonna post it on facebook, but I'm importing it into a wallet i don't know that much about and therefore don't trust 100%
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:34:46
Because i want to claim my btg and i need to export the private key to a wallet that supports that.
So I should make a new wallet with a new seed to be 100% safe? Thx for the answer!

How does that work? You buy btc for 50$ at 5000$ then sell the btc once it hits 10000$ and buy btc for the money?

If you use 240 satoshi pr byte and the median size for a transaction is 226 bytes that should amount to 0,00054 BTC for a transaction.
Either you have a very very big transaction in bytes or you have miscalculated I think.

You can use this site to see what you should use as fee, and what is the expected confirmation time for each fee size

That's not true at all in my view.

That's some zen wisdom right there. Well said!
