Well in the name of not spreading misinformation it is important that you correct yourself. If only you to seem credible.
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:45:57
This is very true. 
As long as enough people buy into the system... Employment/Mortgages/Consumerism the charade can continue forever.
The one thing about economics is that you are retrofitting metrics to human behavior. Hence why economics is just a series of models that try to explain what we do. Any Econ professor will tell you that almost nothing is a hard "fact" in economics, in the way that math or physics is.
The economy doesn't collapse once debt hits some magic number. It collapses when the obvious rational choice is for the majority of humans to not believe in government/currency. If you all went to work today or made a silly purchase or have bank debt then you are complicit in the system. Owning a little Bitcoin won't change how bought in we ALL are.
Including our politicians, it's not some secret club of controllers necessarily. We are just all staying organized as a society as best we know today. And yes at the moment (at least as it relates to the "West"), the USA remains the example we all look towards. That said in my recent travels I can tell you more and more folks genuinely want to give fuck all the about the USA. Yet they still use iPhones, follow Kylie on Instagram and have a Gmail account. So even if they don't want to they are still feeding US consumption... Which at scales keeps the economic metrics looking "healthy"

@_date: 2019-11-14 00:50:03

So if Paypal is better and cheaper and BTC isn't going to replace centralized monetary systems what is the purpose of the coin? As tool for liberty? A speculative investment tool?
Just curious as mentioned I am a long term holder and I believe in this space long term so not trying to FUD. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:21:09
I am of two minds here. 
I completely agree that the value prop of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized and allows for trust without having to place in a single entity. This is a massive innovation and if the smartphone didn't exist I would say it is without question the most important invention of the 21st century. 
That said, our centralized monetary system (I'm from the USA so I'll reference ours) at this point does work well. The biggest financial crisis was averted (a crisis that was a once in a 100 year thing) and we are better for it now. I have a lot of faith in the American economy, our reserve currency status puts us in an amazing place. We have the world's leading companies and we continue to innovate at an impressive clip. Hell the USA is one of the countries that is said to have the best attitude to Bitcoin.
My point? Having a maximalist attitude is probably not the best way to account for bitcoin's value. Being the first proof of concept for the blockchain is why I love BTC. Frankly I think Ethereum and other coins will take it over eventually. Of course I hold BTC but the true innovation is going to come through projects built on ETH. Through companies building private blockchains to lower costs. Through start ups massively lowering costs in cases where the blockchain provides efficiency. 
Bitcoin as a global currency?  Likely not going to happen unless we have some serious world turmoil and I don't foresee that happening anytime soon. 
Happy for debate but if BTC isn't a low cost remittance vehicle nor will it replace the US dollar, what is the exact endgame?
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:56:31
My point is that if the endgame is that decentralized currency overthrow our current monetary system then I would be betting against bitcoin (or any crypto) doing that. Or at least I doubt I see it in my lifetime...
It can be a mixture of both though, maybe some countries adopt BTC and the USA doesn't. Very hard to predict how it ends up.
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:03:17
The mere fact this screenshot exists is enough proof this grand experiment is a total success.
It's so funny to hear lay-people argue against Bitcoin. In my head I'm like the fact that you even have an opinon/awareness of Bitcoin is proof enough of its impact.

This requires a lot of explanation to correctly assuage your fears. Putting this comment as a reminder for me to edit and type out. 
Happy to explain though!
I would say this as a precursor to the answer ... You have vastly over-simplified a lot . I expect that you won't take a lot of things that I will say at face value so I would urge you to start by reading the Bitcoin White paper ( for very important foundational knowledge. PS I first read this as a CS Senior in 2012 and most of it went over my head. So don't expect to have an immediate eureka moment. It sounds though that you genuinely want to understand and this is the best way to start IMO.
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:31:03
I mean if you think Dutch Tulips are even a possible comparable then I think we are too divergent in our opinions.
I consider Bitcoin to be a societal/economic innovation for all humans. We can't forget democracy, the steam engine etc.. because their lives are better with their existence. Now just like other energy sources with steam I do believe one day something can innovate on Bitcoin... Of course we are so early in this adoption cycle that may happen after I die.

You are actually describing every single industry in the world.

More often than not we know how to get things more cheaply but simply don't have the desire to build that expertise.

@_date: 2019-02-05 05:52:54


I definitely have to think more on this tidbit, quite interesting to me. Obviously economic theory is never perfect but I see what you are saying/implying here and it makes sense at first glance. 


Well ... I could dive into this a lot more deeply (disregarding the point you made re: it being as deflationary as the economy is productive) but the fact is that consumers in 2019 are extremely impulsive and even for essential purchases are conditioned to consume. In a world where I know I can achieve wealth gain by actively penny-pinching I do think a **lot** of industries contract. Wheat  and eggs production probably won't see hit but steakhouses, juice cleanses and overpriced online delivery probably would. Living in a luxury apartment might seem even less appealing and have a greater marginal cost associated with it. Food and real estate being our kind of "core demands." I would definitely not wish to gamble as much, not pirates movies, support a creator on twitch/youtube just because, pay for Netflix that I barely use, buy a luxury car... use uber vs uber pool etc... because consumption has a higher and more real future cost. America's and I would say almost all economies are kind of predicated on the idea of spending more as you make more money. Which then creates the second level effect of credit card and debt markets etc.. etc...
I guess I'm just saying that we have kind of built such a tradition of consumption in our society that the world we know it would really be shifted on its head possibly with a deflationary currency. At least in the transitionary years  before we learn about the new normal.
So I definitely won't say that you are wrong but just that our entire global culture will have to change for your vision to come to reality. From the government, to corporations to the pan handlers on the street. It is a tall order .... maybe even generational. Kinda like our attempts at ending racism, religious hatred etc.. We know that if we just all got rid of these issues the world could be more productive but it is almost impossible for us to get past what we've been acculturated to believe is "normal." 
@_date: 2019-02-05 14:09:13
Well I'm saying human nature has evolved around inflationary currency and all of what we deem to be a stable economy (which again is still human nature) revolves around consumption.
The first element of a countries GDP is total consumption so literally our economic indicators flip without it.
That said I'm not saying is HAS to be this way, it just is this way at the moment.
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:46:43
A lot more a still relevant today than expected.
But at much lower valuations. Looking at E Trade tells the tale:
So even a potentially useful ALT may never recover to all time levels. Sobering but important to understand the difference between dead and overvalued. The answer is always somewhere in between.

Quoting the comment here also:
This is really an important point. What is it, fundamentally, that gives Bitcoin advantage over its competitors? Because it sure isn't speed, cheap transactions, smart contracts, or exciting new tech. What gives Bitcoin its advantage is trust, network effect, and brand recognition -- all of which are primarily economic factors that have to do with the nature of money. (Considering how powerful of a force this is for Bitcoin, one has to wonder why so many people in this space focus so heavily on the technological selling points of altcoins and not on broader economic questions over what makes money valuable.)
Of the things that give Bitcoin its advantage, the most important, in my opinion, is trust. Trust is fundamental to money. On the US dollar it literally says, "In God We Trust." And yet trust is precisely what BCH completely lacks. No one is even clear on who is developing it, a few shady Chinese miners gave rise to it, the entire community surrounding it is, as the OP said, sketchy, and its main Western proponent, Roger Ver, makes everyone very nervous and comes off more as a used car salesman than someone of real technical knowledge. To make matters worse, the very design of BCH actually promote more centralization which further erodes trust in a blockchain (whose fundamental selling point is inseparable from decentralization).
The premise of BCH backers is that decentralization is really quite secondary, and that cheap fees are the key to success. That is to say, that trust doesn't matter much, what matters is that you have a bunch of oblivious consumers using it. But the irony is, if it were actually left to just its utility merits -- if it weren't siphoning off the trust and reputation of Bitcoin -- it would just be a shitcoin.
Put simply, the very thing that BCH is promoting, its utility advantage over Bitcoin, is the very thing that doesn't give Bitcoin an advantage over its competitors. And at the same time, the very qualities that make Bitcoin more popular than any altcoin, are the qualities BCH seeks to trivialize. If BCH were, for some inconceivable reason, actually able to overtake Bitcoin and claim the title, this new Bitcoin would effectively lose the very things that makes Bitcoin  in the first place.
@_date: 2019-02-04 18:30:34
How do you envision fundamental economic metrics in a society not built around consumption?
I would imagine that the entire stock market which is predicated on earnings growth would have to flip its entire valuation model if currency disincentives consumption.
I am curious where you see society going. As an American in particular so much of economy is based on the concept of active consumption. I mean the fact that advertising is able to buttress TV and the internet is a side effect of a consumption based economy. Same with non-essential services and their popularity (eg. entertainment, travel).
So not agreeing or disagreeing with you, just want to understand your take as your response opened my mind a bit.

PayPal Guide to making huge profits and growing the ecosystem:
1. Every Paypal user also gets a secure Bitcoin Wallet
2. Paypal implements a global Bitcoin -&gt; Fiat (not even vice versa if they don't want to be an exchange) platform that is for the user's currency
3. Profit ... Billions.
Of course corporations are so scared to deviate from the norm.
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:54:33
This was my opinion in 2014.
Mass smartphone adoption even since then (and the 2017 bubble) eased this concern. I think because I have a programming background I like to think of people as being tech illiterate but I am starting to realize I was a bit too harsh.
Humans are very much so able to learn new concepts (regardless of status in life or age). I mean I my 60 year old nanny who had a 5th grade education from a 3rd world country has been using Whatsapp to send voice notes and pics to me. She knows about smart phones and DVD players etc... Once the savvy elite pick up something it will trickle down pending user friendly apps.  Utility always outweighs the need to be savvy.
You have to give it time though the palm pilot opened the door for Huawei. Took about 15 years for the average world citizen but now a couple billion people now have smart phones.
Also smartphone penetration is a huge gateway as well. Don't be too surprised as to the world you see in 15 years. The building blocks are in place.
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:47:57
Yes banks provide leverage. Leverage allows for capable entrepreneurs or households to create wealth.
Banks are important and I wasnt saying they arent. I think though the current payment infrastructure (while probably adequate within many first world countries) pales in comparison to the openness and ease of integration of Bitcoin. The ONLY (and major) downside to Bitcoin is adoption. In a works where BTC to fiat was immediately available everywhere we already have the infrastructure for a global payments next work (layer 0 being the internet, layer 1 being Bitcoin [abstracting complications within each layer away])
Seems we are somewhat in agreeance :)! 
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:07:15
Banks are extremely useful to society (despite their profit seeking added services/fees). I would contend that financial inclusion relates more to the global and accessible nature of the bitcoin network.
It makes it so easy for me to create a borderless business. Why does this matter?
Current solutions (Paypal, visa and master card) require  compatable banks on both ends. This is not a big issue for a country like the USA  (easy to venmo friends or PayPal other US entities). It becomes a lot more complicated when you want to say transact with  someone in Myanmar for instance. 
It may seem trivial but as a dual citizen I see the friction between financial systems and I wish everyone used BTC. The amount of business that could be unlocked is kind of mind boggling, just by having a common language for moving value.
Also if you think about the pervasion of the internet and ability to communicate across borders with ease then it stands to reason that cross border business is happening just not with the same openness as communication.
Sounds like a basic and almost obvious use case but there is a lot of power in simplicity. Kinda like sending email or being able to walk with your phone.... Impossible to measure the impact of those two simple inventions.
PS: another use case, imagine trying to start an online business in a country where a payment processors is not easily supported by current e commerce solutions. Bitpay I believe has no country restrictions. Potential for 1000s of platforms to be built. The missing link though is nass adoption by the general public ... We are certainly a way away there. Time will tell.

Well why would you need a blockchain if it's simply virtual money implemented by the Federal reserve? Why would this system need a public ledger verified by independent miners incentivized by block rewards?
What would they benefit from by implementing the US dollar in a blockchain? 
This comment really just proves how out of touch so many people are regarding the power of this technology.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:04:58
Thanks BudosoNT you are so right. Crypto is definitely a massive innovation but people who expect it to replace the US dollar any time soon are literally outside of their mind.
Yes we have an economic crisis every 100 years or so at the level of 2008/2009 but keeping it all working the other 98% of the time is what we never acknowledge.
Humans are greedy they fuck up everything. Even BTC is showing human disagreement may be creating issues. Don't ever be holier than thou, many folks study the whole idea of an economy. This subreddit / Satoshi / anyone else are not experts in that by any means.
I am long BTC but this really has to be said.

Stop, I can tell you have tried to understand but you are simply stating incorrect things.
Step 1: Take an ECON 001 class
Step 2: Take an ECON 002 class. Pay very close attention to interests rates, the supply and demand of money and inflation.
Step 3: Read the Bitcoin Whitepaper. 
Step 4: Read the Bitcoin Whitepaper 40 more times. Mark down everything you don't understand.
Step 5: Google/Internet/Reddit the things you don't understand. You'll likely have to dabble in learning some Computer Science terms.
Step 6: Cross reference all of things you've learned and then continue to keep abreast of all of the developments in the space. The whitepaper is somewhat outdated compared to the implementation but the theory is extremely sound (ground breaking).
Step 7: Hodl.
Seriously though man, I can tell you are curious but it seems you are just taking the wrong approach. I've been into BTC since 2012 and it took me a couple years to grasp the importance of this technology and the future implications.
Is it perfect? No. Are there questions to be asked about what a deflationary currency would be like? YES! However just like any economic topic there is no magic bullet, it is about marrying theory with human behavior. Which no-one can perfectly predict.
Anyhow all the best man!

I know this could definitely dip lower but without question all of my intuition is confirming the value of this price right now. Sure I could wait for it to go to 6k (it might I have no clue) but I also know that in the long term these coins are going to be worth a hell of a lot more than they are today.
I'm trying to explain to family members the psychology that is so hard to shake in crypto. The desire to buy when prices are going up and the desire to sell when they are going down. The despair has set in here, people aren't buying and now it is time to make size-able purchases for the long term (trading stacks can be made after the rise IMO). 
I've NEVER been able to call a top or call a bottom perfectly however I have been able to see when we are blatantly too far in one direction.
BTC (and other quality projects) will surpass its ATH again. The discount here is too great and the despair too strong. As I watch this break under 8k, I am checking that my Ledger is safe and calling my investment advisor for more funds.
I know this may seem counter intuitive to many of you (especially newbies) but even if it takes 5 years I am certain that this technology will only being more ubiquitous in our lives.

They are forking complicated code and making simple modifications. Even if they are somehow the correct things to do, if the devs stay with BTC long term/complicated bugs on the other chains are likely to exist there. The codebase needs to be maintained and without the developer community these coins will simply die to buggy code written by subpar devs :o.

The only logical next step I can infer is that you have a fundamental issue with capitalism in general (based on your critique of debt and spending). I agree with you in that the system results in winners at the expense losers and that it is by no means perfect. 
All of that said if you look worldwide capitalism is almost clearly the best form of socio-economic organization that works best. Money is literally the only thing that can get humans to organize themselves (cooperations) effectively. 
So my point is "mainstream economics" is here to stay. Decentralized currency doesn't solve for an economy. To your original point Bitcoin won't eliminate the need for debt/capital markets. If you truly think that then we have to agree to disagree.

Do you realize that "spending" is a major part of how we define our GDP right?
Do you realize if we stop spending on stupid things the ripple effect is that a ton of companies go belly up and a ton of people lose their jobs? Think of something like twitch.tv as an example, it would probably be stupid to give some bitcoin to them every month given we all believe its value will rise right? What becomes of twitch.tv without content creators who can sustain themselves?
Do you realize that if holding money is a better investment than starting a business then innovation takes a massive hit?
Be very careful with your armchair economics. Take some time to study the field these are intro level concepts so you'll pick it up quickly.

This is one of the best comment threads I’ve ever read.
Not that my opinion carries any weight whatsoever but I think the core this conversation comes down to the fact that greed is currently the best way to organize / incentivize humans.
In the USA that’s why there are legitimate reasons to be liberal or conservative. Greed leads to prioritizing money making (even within governments) which also lead negative side effects (doctors being overpaid, unfair hiring practices, disproportionate salaries). The other end to that sword though is that greed is the only way we can all cooperate...
When you go to work and give up 8-14 hours a day you are doing it because of greed. Or at least a desire to not be poor (whatever you want to label that ). It’s through that though the companies can ultimately maximize their profits.
Bitcoin as a concept isn’t truly about financial freedom because the same greed applies. The greed has created this value BUT just like it does in capitalism, greed in crypto has many positive side effects in this case. 
***by the way I recognize that capitalism and crypto aren’t mutually exclusive***
Bitcoin allows for true free trade and true free enterprise. The biggest hurdle is/was awareness and adoption, the greed to make outsize gains will lead to awareness and adoption. Then we will all benefit ... not necessarily in a utopia creating kind of way but in a way that creates a lot of efficieny. Kinda like the internet... didn’t fix poverty but it damn sure made a lot of things more efficient. Hell the internet allowed for Bitcoin... The internet / free passage of info is still so mind boggling how much impact it has/will have (which I guess could be derived from computers and silicon chips... damnit I’m in a haze of awe now)

That's actually where a lot of the "value" of the coin comes from. Paying for the electricity to keep it safe.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:22:35
In theory yes however in practicality please understand the sheer computing power required to overtake the nodes -&gt; 
51% would mean you either need to power down half the network and replace it with your own OR getting the mining power of all of the bitcoin miners + 1 (51% = 50.00000000001%).
And if you read Satoshi's paper he further theorizes that IF someone were to takeover bitcoin the price would tank. Hence the reward of taking over bitcoin becomes nothing. Instead it would be most rational for the attacker to become the master miner and make money that way securing the system.
Beautiful eh? 
Anyhow you aren't wrong in bringing this up as a discussion.
PS: I accept that the last paragraph there is theoretical but in practice bitcoin has proven for the past 8 years or so that it is very very very very secure.

Nothing is an impossibility. 
Some points:
-&gt; Banks in and of themselves are actually not the corporate entities with the most cash on hand (ie to spend without consequence) those are actually tech companies. Apple and Google being  and  so keep them in mind in theory. I have reason to believe Google/Apple/Facebook/Microsoft are intrigued and not threatened by the idea of a blockchain.
Banks/hedge funds/pension funds/mutual funds do manage a LOT more money than tech companies have however if they do use it to mess with bitcoin then the economy could crash. A trillion dollars disappears from TIAA CREF / BlackRock / Vanguard or Goldman without being accounted for? Rest assured those entities would be closed down (remember trust is what banks provide yeah - kinda coming full cirlce) and the economy could suffer. If the bank is unsucessful price of bitcoin skyrockets. My point is that it is not a no risk engagement for a bank. Also in general from a stock market perspective banks have much much tighter margins than tech companies they really don't have as much *profit* to work with on a project like this. Again nothing is impossible but I repeat a bank trying to attack bitcoin and failing would ruin its business completely (from a trust and financial perspective).
-&gt; Given that I think it is relatively unlikely a private coorporation funds a 51% attack. The other options would be:
i) A government with a lot of money (USA, China and Russia). Yeah totally possible honestly, our US government is proving to be out there lately. Governments do have trouble building proper fighter jets and stopping internet piracy. This would require some serious expertise that I have no fully seen from them tbh. They are good at demanding things (ie surveillance and taking our data) but building a bitcoin attack from scratch? It is certainly not a *simple* task for them (or anyone for that matter). They are probably the likeliest though if the incentives align for them I guess.
ii) An underground cartel with tons of fiat. Escobar was said to be uber rich yeah?
iii) Someone like Bill Gates (he definitely wouldn't, I truly trust that man for some reason). Koch brothers more likely but not sure
iv) Antminer? Earn bitcoin build more asics in secret idk?
v) Coalition of less wealthy people?
We would need to evaluate the risk reward for each of the the above and remember we are accepting the goal is to destroy bitcoin as a comprimised currency is worthless. As other posters mentioned if this happened I think some form of hardfork to a different proofing mechanism would be put into place - so they would need close to infinite funds to do it forever or at least an easy way to do it. 
It would be a hell of a story if someone tried this successfully though, I wish someone could do the math on how much a super computer/data center of that capacity would cost. I bet it is ridiculously expensive (multi billions prob). I mean you would need so much support staff alone lol!
I also just had a final thought, if this were to happen could we call together a world spirit bomb of computing power? I mentioned tech companies above but I would not be surprised if they were willing to take our money to direct their datacenters at bitcoin until the attackers were found. Man real life is crazier than fiction!

Sad to say folks but segments like these prove two things:
i) Very few people have the desire or capacity to look at Bitcoin with an open mind and to understand how impactful it will be to humanity. Hopefully our kids/grandkids can learn from us though.
ii) Fact based arguments always (Bitcoin or otherwise) get shut down by one liners and increasingly so in 2019 (information overload, no-one has time to absorb facts)
This entire crypto winter I realized it isn't good to talk to people about Bitcoin if they are not making a good faith effort to listen. Kevin is a rich guy anyways he will be fine, I am just sad to see mass media making money off of one-liners.
I'm ok with it in sports (Stephen A Smith) or entertainment (TMZ) but when it comes to real life (investment, healthcare, law enforcement, wars) it is just saddening. I guess this has always been a side effect of mass media. Propaganda is more common than the truth.
I will never be as rich as Kevin here I don't think but I take solace in knowing I don't dismiss things so brashly. Money over intellectual integrity, hard choice I guess...
