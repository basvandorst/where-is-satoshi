Is there anything not looking shady and scammy in here?
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:02:20
That's a bit rude, I would simply say that I dont know exact number of bitcoins or I'd refuse to tell them nicely.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:28:57
get a hardware wallet and hodl !!!

There is no way to get free bitcoin unless someone send it to you. You are wasting your time... 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:08:44
You can buy Antminer S9 (best asic miner, for now) directly from it's producers - bitmain.com

I wouldn't suggest you to invest in something you won't know how to manage. Especially bitcoin. 
1. Find a good wallet by getting started on bitcoin.org
2. Check FaQ, Google, YT and educate about bitcoin.
3. Get a hardware wallet like trezor for bigger amount of btc (For me, bigger amount of money is anything more than 100$ in btc, but, hey, not everyone can afford to loose much money)
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:48:43
Better make a website, followed by social media accounts. I'd say you will need to invest some money in, even if its the non profit organisation. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:29:34
Dont invest in cloud mining sites. They are all scam.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:24:56

The only way to mine bitcoin is with ASIC miners like Antminer S9.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:14:52
You can buy BTC / ETH with CC on CEX.io directly, but it will cost you a bit more.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:46:05
They are the resellers. They buy, than sell back to you for bigger amount of money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:07:16
There is one website providing accomplishing old coins, but they take some % and I forgot their name, but pretty sure you can google.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:19:41
19.1 GH/s? 
no thanks
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:32:10
Simply buy bitcoin I guess? Dont use that shit.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:59:38
definitely yes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:14:33
I hope not.

Did you know that reddit haa a seatch feature? Or even heard of google? Cmon bros, same question is asked at least 10 times a day.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:45:19
That's why you need to buy 50% of btc you want right in that moment, and 50% later, just in case you dont miss the dip.

But, hey, someone wont be bored while cleaning this mess on weekend!

It could if you bought 1 btc few years ago and sold it now or in ~2020

@_date: 2017-12-23 10:39:25
50% of amount I want to buy I buy when I want to. Than I wait a bit to see will there be any dips, and if there is a dip, I use another 50% to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:58:07
Mining isnt scam. Cloud mining is.
Also, are you sure you want to invest in mining? 
Yes, you will be getting 2k$ from 2x S9s, but, woth current Difficulty and price. Difficulty is always adjusting, and he price/rate is always changing aswell. Also, getting a S9 nowadays is a bit harder, because they accept only Bcash payments and you will need about 2 months to get what you've paid for.
I'm not saying mining is bad, I'm just saying that you need to be pretty sure in what are you investing and how, especially if you cant afford to loose that amount of money.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:17:25
if you say so.

@_date: 2017-12-10 14:59:54
Ohh my God... Did you know that Reddit has a search function?
This question is asked at least 50 times a day, literally.

Hope you are not literally asking to buy a lambo, but yea, more than one, we hope!
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:08:23
Why do you need to talk about it so much? If you really want to talk about it, just say that you are investing in cryptocurrencies (virtual currencies). Also, if you dont know in what you are investing, why would you do that? You need to educate yourself more about it if you dont know how to explain it to someone simply.

Buy Antminer off Bitmain.com
Price is now higher but a month ago s9 was priced at 1200 usd. Now it's 2700.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:11:12
1. Bitmain is the official creator of Antminer series, currently the best ASIC btc miner. Do, yes, they are of course trusted.
2. Not all people understand and heard of cryptocurrencies.
3. It's easy to find pool. Bitmain even have their own, Antpool.
4. It's important but only because you are paying for it, price of kwh doesnt affect mining directly, but if you pay more than the others, you will have less profit, of course 
If you didnt know, cryptocompare.com has a bitcoin and altcoin mining profitability calculator which you can use.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:43:31
1. buy alts  with some % of your profits
2. hodl your bitcoins so they will be worth more in some time
3. hodl your alts
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:18:08
1. get a hardware wallet if you are holding bigger amount of btc
2. dont panic sell and just hold
3. buy when the price is dropping

@_date: 2017-12-23 13:15:04
I think people dont do exactly that because you need to own 1 BTC to have +200/300$ profit daily in trading. Also you need a lot of time, money (to buy BTCs) and people can make mistakes. And it's not guaranteed that BTC price will go higher than it's current (alt'ho it will.)
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:45:50
No. Bitcoin will need to go up to 36k$ in order to double your money. Better buy some cheap and popular altcoins for that money and do a long term hodl. 25$ isnt an invest tho. And, dont ask reddit how to manage your money. Your money, your call.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:09:52
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:35:22
Let's say they pay 1500$ for lets say 15 TH/s for Bitcoin miner. Let's say that 15 TH/s gives you about 800$ monthly (It doesnt, I just set an example).
So, they take about 2500$ from you for less than 15 TH/s and they give you less than 800$ monthly. Got me?
Simply: They resell hashing power, but their prices are very very high.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:12:17
hahahahaha, nice one. Maybe.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:06:13

Get a job bro...
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:04:44
Well, I said it's one of the most popular. Currently yss, they are cheap, and I hope they will go up.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:47:42
No. THEY pay for 15th/s 1500$. Than, they sell you 15th/s for 2500$, eventually even less than 15, plus they charge additional fees.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:39:31
No. But I didn't put any money before I knew in what am I putting my money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:30:35
They set their own fees.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:41:19

lol... you need to do a little bit more research before investing in mining...
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:12:14
Probably Scrypt ASIC miner, from 2014.
Google the logotype...
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:49:52
If you have lets say 0.01 btc, you will alwqys have it (unless you sell, send or spend it of course). 0.01 btc is equal to 77$ ( calculated by today's price for 1 btc which is 7.777$ ).
But, if the price of btc grow up to let's say 15.554$ (double of the current price), your 0.01 btc will be worth 154$.

Check FAQs, YT and Google...
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:24:47
Yes. The question is, would anyone buy it?
It's quite old, and I dont know exactly how much hash power does it produce.As I said, you need to google a bit to find what model it is exactly. Or try @_date: 2017-11-21 11:49:25
Probably. If you think so.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:48:24
by inspecting source of the page.

No. He didnt get 4k. He got bitcoin while 1 was valued at 4k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:20
Even if you have free power, you wont be able to make any good money. But, you can mine ETH, ZEC or any other altcoins succesfully with that GPU, and just exchange it for a btc.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:19:16
So, what's gonna happen, Im very curious
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:33
lol, no, dont....
bitmain.com 's AntMiner S9 is a think you will looking for.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:03:18
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:51:32
Better sell it for btc and hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:18
Bitcoin is using SHA256 algorithm and you can only mine it with ASIC machines like AntMiner S9... You can downvote as much as you want, but Im telling you, I mine myself that's why I know.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:43:55
You dont need to use exchanges for small amounts... ATM will do a job
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:39:11
okay thanks
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:30:31
Its easy but Im not on PC
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:17:14
Check FaQ, YT and Google.
The safest way to hold bitcoin is by holding it on hardware wallet (trezor / ledger / etc... ).
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:07:12
You can use btcrates.info's rates API to get live bitcoin rates.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:44:50
Ledger or Trezor. I prefer Trezor.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:37:33
I can bet some of them are secretly hodling.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:20
You will, trust me!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:31
Bro.... You need research a lot more before being interested in investing in mining.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:29
You will thank them later for not letting you panicSell your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:50:00
You need a ASIC machine to mine bitcoin profitably. 
In order to mine other coins, you will need GPU rig. 
I dont think you can mine on mobile without making a mobile rig and coding your own software.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:43:58
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:45:20
Dont ask reddit how to manage your money.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:50:51
1. depends on exchange / atm you are using
2. yes, there is a fee whenever you send bitcoin (depends on ur wallwt but some wallets have custom fee so you can set a custom one)
3. ?
4. depends on exchange / atm u are using
5. on exchange of your choice, atm or for cash to someone
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:12:10
it depends on owner, atm or company. Sorry,I cant answer that, but, in my country, when I withdrawed 110€ I got ~102€ - btc fees.

As I said, you will regret it later. Just dont forget my words ;)

If you can retrieve and give back that money (if you loose it, but I srsly hope and think you wont), than it should be okay. But,never invest in anything amount of money you cant afford to loose, even if your chances are 99.9 out of 100. 
If you are asking me for opinion,I would do it, but I'm in that position. Not all people are in same position.

Bitmain is official Antminer producer. It's website is bitmain.com
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:14:56
Im not sure if investing in bitcoin is right investment for you... but, here you go.
What is the percentage increase/decrease
from 8500 to 10000? 
It's = 17.64%
17.64% of 90$ is 15.87$
90 + 15.87$ = 105.87$
You will have ~105.87$.

2btc is a big amount of money. I though you are talking about 100-200$ max since you are asking easy questions... Also, I said the easiest, but not the best ;)
Best way is exchange of course.

If you are investing small amount of money in bitcoin, you should consider is as a long term investment since BTC's price will need to raise a lot in order to make profit.
If you are investing a big amount of money in bitcoin, for example lets say 1 btc (9k$ at he moment of writing), you can make good profit in just few months.

I dont think you will find any open source ones. Probably because providing source code of exchange website is helping a hackers/people to find bugs on their website which they can later use to exploit system.

You can simply google "bitcoin to usd" and check any website you get. If you want to convert BTC to any currency, use btcrates.info
Also,I suggest you to buy hardware wallet for big amounts of btc or any other cryptocurrency (trezor.io)
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:41:41
you can use poloniex for different cryptocurrencies but he safest wallet is trezor.io (or any other hardware wallet)

okay, but if we assume that there is, even if there isnt, a cloud mining website that is not a scam, how would it generate profit?

If you are going to hold a higher amount of bitcoins, use hardware wallet - trezor.io
For smaller amounts of funds, I'm using online wallets like BTC.com (BE SURE to enable 2fa auth on both email and website account!)
You can track live bitcoin rates on btcrates.info
For first purchase, ughhh, we cant help you there, but buy from trusted sources or big website.

In order to mine 1 btc per month, you need hashing power of 193 TH/s, considering you got free el.
Since one S9 can provide hashing power of 13.5 TH/s, you will need 14 bitmain's antminers (s9)
You need about 19k$ investment in order to mine 1 btc per month, not considering el. power cost.
