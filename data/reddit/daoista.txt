True, and in another completely unrelated topic, do any of you know where to find tips about homemade bunkers ?
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:08:08
Agree, specially on this time when there are talks about periodically changing our big bills here in Brazil and the incoming recession the in upon us all

You gave a better answer than most, and I completly agree with you

I touched myself, does that count?

First time I'm proud to say I'm a Brazilian in this sub
Meus parabéns Brasil, alguma coisa estamos fazendo certo

See you there pal

Similar to the usa on the begining of the last century, when people's started using bank deposit notes in place of gold coins

I live in another state, as important as São Paulo, and I have never seen a BTC atm bedore

Words to live by

True that, I'm Brazilian and we as a population are dumb as a door.
Brasileiro é quase tudo gado

I'm all in on BTC, 80% of my savings are on it, 20% on stokcs an government titles.
@_date: 2019-03-16 10:46:06
I'm together with you mate.
Dead man tell no tales, same for the mute and smart ones.
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:23:12
for a moment I though you were Brazilian, since we have a bank with this same name, state bank
@_date: 2019-03-16 16:42:04
I use coingcheckup.com
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:07:29
isn't that the plan for all of us in here?
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:13:00
I just saved that, let's hope it happens like that
@_date: 2019-08-09 10:44:13
I use bisq, but only national transactions, mainly me buying.  Do you have any concerns of it being tracked back to you? Like the government investigating you.
@_date: 2019-08-30 15:27:15
If we build it on land, we will have the problem of foot invasion, tanks and similar. At least on water we can be mobile and make ourselves near more friendly countries. And of course we will have our own defense system.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:20:44
True that
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:30:15
Sorry for you friend, I'm Brazilian and have been buying since 2 years ago.
I use Bisq, decentralized exchange, no kyc needed.
And you are doing the right thing, as the prospect of the kirshner going back on presidency keep on getting higher and higher so will bitcoin price.
Boa sorte amigo, vc vai precisar.
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:27:36
That's my idea. International waters are no man's land. There's plenty of water to cooll our miners and we can adapt them to desalinite the sea water. We can utilize the trash on the see to build and recicle, and best of all it can be movable.
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:58:13
Well, I started in 2018 and have never been more happy.
Remember kids, never forget to dollar cost average.
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:34:38
Try the exchange bisq, it's decentralized, p2p and you can chose to do the payment by person, bank transfer or other.
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:54:54
I highly recommend two books, "what does the government does with our money" and " anatomy of the state"
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:45:39
True that, I made this mistake, never again
@_date: 2019-08-03 07:14:57
Another Brazilian here, can confirm this champ words, we can fuck this pretty easily
 
Bom ver um outro maldito brasileiro por aqui, nos vemos na cidadela

I'd like to welcome you, since there are a lot of good advice on how to buy and hold it, I'll just skip this part, what I'm about to tell you is as important:
1- never post on the internet that you own bitcoin, and if you do, be sure that there is no way in heel that it can be traced to the you in real life, things may get nasty depending on the amount you have.
2- even if you put your bitcoins on a hardware wallet, remember that it is an electronic device, and after some time it tend to lose the information stored inside (old dvd are a good example), so I recommend to periodically check the your hardware wallet and have a backup for it.
3- this is a long term game, forget about sort term 1000x value increase, think of it as a pension fund or SHTF fund (shit hit the fan).
4- I can't stress this enough, don't invest more than you're prepared to lose and the golden rule of investment: "DON'T INVEST ON WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW"
@_date: 2019-08-16 10:58:37
 !remind me 1 year
@_date: 2019-10-07 11:16:25
That will never happen, once you buh Bitcoin, it's yours
@_date: 2019-08-30 17:10:55
Very well likely for that to happens. There will be those that will try to steal from our wealth, and there will be those that will sell us things we need to get our wealth, just like now, some governments are trying to steal while others are more friendly, there are companies that were built on this ecosistem, like trezos.  It will happen like now, but on a bigger scale, that's Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:34:11
Don't recommend that sub, um in there is almost an YouTube chanel. I prefer here to get information on bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:47:17
I invested all my savings and a good part of my wife savings, with her concent, in bitcoin. She has asked me more than once, when we can sell, I always respond with "when we truly need" or "it's our retirement fund", what she doesn't know is that I'm never selling bitcoins for fiat, ever again, there will be a time when those bitcoins won't be a sum of dollars, it will be simply bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:55:25
You have been baptized, just don't try trading, just buy more, never sell
@_date: 2019-10-07 10:18:59
Think of Bitcoin as a stock, you bought it for X, now the price is going down, so if you try to sell it you will get less than you invested, if the price goes up and you try to sell it, you will get more than you paid. A good tip is to hold it, on the long term.
  
Sorry for the sarcastic comments that you may find in here, we are kind of like that, don't take it personal.
@_date: 2019-10-05 14:00:26
I'm awaiting for this one also
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:37:41
Lol, thanks friend
@_date: 2019-06-12 09:45:56
So having a whole bitcoin make me an whale?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:57:46
Weak hands, they have weak hands
@_date: 2019-06-11 10:11:36
I foresee 3 possibilities.
1- people will flow to bitcoin to protect themselves from inflation, just like gold, we might see an influx of desperate people buying for stability, price goes up
2- people will sell from bitcoin because they have made enough and they need to buy other commodities, we might see the price going down.
3- a combination of 1 &amp; 2, there will be an influx on new buyers and those that are already in will sell part of their stash to better their lives, the price will go up, but with a lot of downs and corrections.
I base my opinion on the current state of Venezuela and Argentina
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:45:26
Good to know, tks man
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:49:04
Yes I did, but she simple has no interest in bitcoin

Put aliens for someone with more than 1000 BTC
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:12:50
You should give bisq a try

A very good point, funny how people in here can't correlate with other assets, it's like a cult sometimes, blind trust is never a good thing, question everything for God's sake
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:57:44
Yes, I think that Facebook Libra is going to be a good thing for bitcoin, as in it will be a getaway to truly decentralized crypto, and it will compete with other centralized currencies, such as dollar and other fiats

@_date: 2019-04-19 16:19:40
I don't know, but I'm actually interested in your question. But I don't think there will be any data that will be 100% sure, from what I understand, on the blockchain there is no way to find out where the btc was bought/sold unless the buyer/seller tell you or you know the owner of the wallet

2008? Listen here pal, every bank today is more deeply stuck with debth securities than in 2008, if the french do really try to withdraw all or most of their money, it won't only be the french banks that will be in a pinch. We'll all be on rout to 1929. Do you get it? The Big Depression,  Black Thursday, all over again.
@_date: 2019-09-02 08:40:53
Sorry mam, religion and politics are never a good mix, our president is slowly pointing religious leaders (Catholics) to governments positions, that's a really bad idea and I'm afraid that in 20 some years we will be like you guys

Good that you got it out in time

In USA it's nothing, in here it's enough to live more than 2 years. One month of my salary can buy 0,05 btc
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:41:02
That's the volatility that i missed, welcome back
@_date: 2019-09-01 09:32:49
"what does the government does with our money", the most recent versions have a chapter about bitcoin, everything else is the history of how the state has fucked the monetary system.
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:37:46
Agree with you, I just couldn't let it sit there, this was supposed to be my retirement, now it's just a nightmare. The fault is all on me

I do like orange coin, I can give you worthless fiat for orange coin
@_date: 2019-09-01 16:11:04
As a Brazilian myself, I can't find this more funny, our government is full of shit crazy people, if I could I'd leave this shithole called brazil.
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:41:06
Now I'll have to start from scratch
@_date: 2019-09-17 23:45:57
Good that you got it out in time

Brazilian here, unfortunately they still didn't announce which crypto besides Bitcoin they will accept, looked over many news by different publishers, but nothing....

All of mine and my wife life savings or 1.26 btc
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:14:49
Not really relevant, just a personal question
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:27:27
I was looking for you
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:03:29
True that, i have mines ready to post as soon as it reaches 9k
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:57:41
I would also recommend reading "what has the government done with our money", it's very enlightening, explains the gold standard, fiat money, it's problems, inflation, all that which dramatically impact our lives but very few know of ot and even less understand it.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:52:38
Agree, i bought bitcoin some years ago and I've been hodling since, now my government wants me to declare how much crypto I have AND pay taxes on that, over my dead body, my bitcoins are safe and sound away from the hands of this criminal group AKA government
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:46:14
Is it possible for ot to work?
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:16:57
I used my money to buy something which I like, why should the government take more money from me for that? That is something that has never made sense to me, I won't give a satoshi to the govnerment, mark my words
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:59:01
Gonna use it next time we breach 9000
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:04:25
It's a very good thing that the gang know as state doesn't know how ot works, to this way it makes it easier to overthrow the government
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:47:24
Taxes should be optional, like, if you want the government to go to war, you pay the taxes for that, if you want safety, there you go, if you want nothing, don't pay
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:43:36
I live in Brazil.
This shit show called democracy is 51% attacking the other 49, to do what they think is best for others, only myself knows what is better for me and only yourself knows what is better for you, why should the government decide what I can study at school? Why can't I teach my kids at home (homeschooling)? Why do they decide how much is the gas prices and not the company selling it?
Democracy is a fairy tail, a convenient lie to keep us obedient where they chose who lives and who dies.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:30:06
The answer is 42, the answer is always 42
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:42:47
I don't think so, people will just keep on changing money to bitcoin and to money again when needed, it just will make people see inflation more clearly, with time bitcoin will be more wanted than dollar, making the price of dollar falling and bitcoin rising. On my point of view, bitcoin make monetary policies worst
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:51:46
Yes, and sadly very few people understand that, education is not a right, it's a service, safety is not a right, it's a service.
You are responsible for yourself and your choices, don't make a stupid choice and later cry saying it wasn't your fault, it was, you chose it, one way or the other.
@_date: 2019-05-25 14:48:14
Do weekly buys, or monthly, that's what I do, but of you have the funds and the balls, sure, go all in
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:03:48
I recomend the books "*Gold Standard*" and "*What the goverment does with our money*"
@_date: 2019-05-27 19:31:50
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:22:03
Yes, we are born free and poor, the only thing we have is our freedom, our property and our life, those are the apriori natural rights, everything on AnCap is based on those.
And by property I mean the things we make our own, like the food we ingest and things we aquire.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:02:53
True that, i have mines ready to post as soon as it reaches 9k

A pretty good camping, I disagree with some of the things it says, but nonentlees good
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:12:24
if we actually see 100k, it would probably go down just like december/17
 
If it really happens I may start believing this crap.
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:51:43
True, but my and a lot of people that I know have been "converted" to Anarcho-capitalism (AnCap), it's a growing movement in here, we elected some governors on the last election
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:30:25
Maybe, but they as greedy as every human is, would have a lot more to lose by doing that, at least that is what I think
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:08:37
Also curious to know, by the taxes I would guess a south america country (brazil, argentina) or maybe western Europe ( french, spain or portugal)
