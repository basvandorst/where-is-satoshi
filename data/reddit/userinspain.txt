A more constructive comment would be to provide an argument for the reason why you believe this is such an obvious scam since many people generate that level of return trading bitcoins.

20% interest is certainly not a common savings return, at least in Europe.
However, the bitcoin community should be able to enter into contractual relationships without being defrauded and generating a bad reputation in the financial world.
The post is intended to warn other potential investors in good faith.
It is a criminal offence to commit fraud resulting in a sentence and a criminal record and luckily there is plenty of evidence since lawyers have been involved from the first instance.
This is akin to entering into a contractual relationship with any other entity and being ripped off. It's not a question of being gullible.

That's a really smart response.
However, this is akin to entering into a contractual relationship with any other entity and being ripped off. It's not a question of being gullible.
The owner of the company has shared all of his details in the signed contract to his demise, it is a criminal offence that carries a sentence and a record.
The objective of the court procedure is to hold people accountable for their bad practice for the principle if nothing else, the problem occurs if you do nothing about it since you only perpetuate these circumstances. "Barely any time" is infinitely better than no time.
