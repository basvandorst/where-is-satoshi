Yeah... that seems implausible.  How much money do you think exists?
According to this source, a 2.1 Quadrillion market cap would represent about 26x more money than currently in existence.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:22:39
Maybe in 50 years... that would reflect Bitcoin being worth 500x more than all of the gold on the planet...  You're suggsting a **quadrillion** dollar market cap.
Might be a bit overly optimistic.  Satoshi parity with the US cent is optimistic, but plausible.   Parity with the dollar would necessitate a huge amount of inflation because there isn't enough money in the global financial system currently to support such a high price.

Not familiar with that meme.
Derivatives are a form of contract.  So are checks.  Both are worthless if the party obliged to pay you runs out of money/assets. 
 It's a pretty fair comparison.

Lol @ counting notional value of derivatives. 
That's like if I wrote you a quadrillion checks for a dollar, and then you started calling yourself the richest man in the world: you might be able to collect on the first few, but pretty soon you'll find my checking account empty and the remaining checks would be completely worthless.
If all derivatives defaulted, maximum loss would be equal to the equity value of all parties holding derivatives.  Notional value could never be reaches, because liabilities greatly exceed net assets.

It works for a while, but historically (AFAIK) all companies selling hashrate either:
1. Underperform an investment directly into Bitcoin (because difficulty increases cause actual earnings to fall short of 'projected earnings' at time of purchase)
2. Get hacked or close up shop without paying out all liabilities
A number have even done both.

Well, without strong proof, buying paper gold is pretty much equivalent to trading in a bucket shop:  it works perfectly until it doesn't.  
It would definitely be a crazy black swan event if a big fund like GLD suddenly folded and left you holding the bag, but is an additional risk vs physical that should be acknowledged and priced into your decision making.
Personally, I view gold and precious metals as a 'diversifying asset of last resort', so I'd want to be robust against SHTF situations, like major societal dysfunction or a large global fraud perpetuated by banks.
I will never own more gold than I could easily hide within my own belongings, so I don't see the additional risk and management costs of GLD worth the convenience of not having to secure it yourself.

Even if they are scammers, it is good that they are doing it in a publicly announced way.  Currently anyone can pull off this 'attack' for a few thousand dollars, and by announcing their intentions before hand they are able to demonstrate the effects with minimal disruption to the network.
I don't think coinwallet.eu is a hero of the Bitcoin community by any means, but bitcoin is a decentralized system which needs to be tolerant to impolite behaviors. Proving that an attack can be done cheaply isn't worthless.

Never. Buy. Hashrate.  
If you want to invest in Bitcoin, just buy the coins directly.  Any scheme that seems like a 'cheaper' way to get coins is either a scam or has a LOT of counterparty risk.

Target is the person you're attacking.  They have an address and are running Bitcoin software.  
In the bitcointalk example, they are running an exchange or similar service with pooled hot wallet (all funds are held in big pool, not individual addresses for each user). This attack practically requires the target to have automated deposits or withdrawals, because the attack will only last for ~10 minutes, and you can't count on someone manually seeing your deposit and processing your withdrawal request within that 10 minute window. 
Withdrawal means transferring coins from the exchanges wallet to your own.

Kind of a hard concept to get across in 30 seconds, but the 3% txn fee is often higher than the store's profit margin.  
Grocery stores and gas stations have ~1% profit margin, so if you pay them with credit card, the bankers are often making MORE money than the merchant.  It's insane. 
Appealing to the audiences sense of injustice at this situation could be powerful.

There is a 50% chance of a block being found roughly every 7 minutes, so :
chance of no blocks = 1/(2^(minutes since last block / 7 mins))
thus, there is roughly a 4.4408921e-16 chance of not finding a block in 6 hours.

"Godfather"-style scene of a gaggle of bankers walking through a shopping arcade, circa 1900-50s old-timey feel.

"Cool" stall, with an attractive protagonist in it. Bankers jovially walk up and try to reach into the stall, but as their hand moves towards it, it bounces off a forcefield (grid of light or something like [this](

Thanks, this is great. 
Seems like miners don't need to keep the full blockchains of sidechains, but still a bit worried about how big these DMMS's would be and how much extra load they would put on full nodes.
They mention changing headers to a "skiplist" as a possible forking change to bitcoin which could get million-block DMMS's down to 20kb (impressive, little skeptical).  But is this functionality a requirement for the scheme to work, how big would the block be without it?  
Does this proof get embedded in the blockchain? (If so, seems like blockchain size could grow very fast.  If not, seems like this data wouldn't be widely available on the network and nodes wouldn't be able to fully validate these transactions)

I think the best way to convince your parents Bitcoins aren't a scam and acquire some is to find a product or service you could sell for Bitcoin. 
I bought some pixel art from a 15 year old on the Bitcointalk forums a couple years ago.  Showing your parents that you are using entrepreneurship and making real money (I'd suggest selling some to show your parents that it is "real") could go a long way towards helping allay their worries. 
Anyways, good luck.  Here's a bit to get you started.

Can anyone who understands this paper elaborate on how bitcoins could be locked in a way that only a given state within a sidechain unlocks them?

So, if the network hashrate drops, it increases the "7 minute" part of the equation.
Lets say, for example, that right after a difficulty change, half of the network stops mining.  This would double the 50% chance-of-finding-block-time to 14 mins.  
That would reduce our estimate to 2.98023224e-8 - one hundred million times more likely.  Since there were drastically fewer miners, with much less economic incentive to mine, in 2010, half of the network disappearing temporarily isn't that crazy.  In fact, if a major mining pool like deepbit had gone down for a few hours, it could have cut hashrate by more than a third. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:30:02
I'll bet the hashrate would be lower than that

There is already a voting system that was used for P2SH - miners can put a string in their block header (that is usually just a random number) to indicate for or against.  Once over 51% were for, they made the switch.

Looks like you've got it.  It is definitely an expensive and limited attack.  Don't think it can be applied to too much else.
Another way the target can prevent this attack is by using the attackers last deposit's transaction output in their withdrawal (if they are within a few blocks of each other).  Then, if the double spend invalidated the deposit tx, the withdrawal transaction would automatically become invalid as one of its inputs is not in the blockchain.
