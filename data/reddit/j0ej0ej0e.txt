Because it is important that people have a choice if there want to update or not
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:49:53
It has been two weeks now :)
@_date: 2013-05-06 10:13:29
It has been two weeks again and I need the bitcoins as soon as possible.
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:29:44
No or I will at least try without getting to prison.
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:46:43

I want to see the government burn.
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:16:15
Can you please give me my money back?
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:03:37
I thing that part of the new website is very badly formulated sense it is the "official" website of bitcoin and is suppose to be as impartial as possible.
I suggest: You may be required by law to pay taxes on some bitcoin transactions.
And change the paper symbol to a gun (;
EDIT: The current version is: "Bitcoin is not an official currency. That said, most jurisdictions still require you to pay income, sales, and payroll taxes on anything that has value, including Bitcoin. It is your responsibility to inform yourself about and comply with any applicable laws."
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:37:51
On how long term?
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:44:13
Ok, I will think about it until tomorrow.

I don´t know but isn't hiding from the government non-violent? A violent revolution would be to stand at your door with an assault weapon when the IRS comes, with probably world be a good way to suicide.

0.000016 is worth 0.001464 dollar so it is a start and may be a lot of money if bitcoin continues to increase in value like this (:

Sorry I am not an native English speaker but that's just what I meant, some people thinks paying taxes is a good thing and others don't and bitcoin.org shouldn't take anyones side.
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:16:41
Yeah, that is actually a good idea
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:06:40
I am not an American either so I vill definitely lock into that, especially sense where I live if a foreign corporation get sued (even by the government) the only thing that it can get is a fine and if there doesn't pay  a trade ban for up to 5 years.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:27:12
I wish I had more bitcoins
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:59:13
@_date: 2013-03-30 21:08:05
That might be true but nothing I want to be reminded of, I just don't like the idea that my economic activity are funding war, tortyr, murder and kidnapping.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:27:44
Maybe you should add bitcoin.org and weusecoins.com
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:13:51
Ok, I will give you a loan, tell me when to send the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:27:02
Ok, but please try to pay as soon as possible.
