I am new to reddit and was attracted to this post, which I've asked a question within the post regarding how it is possible to accomplish 2k votes a simple comment. It would be great to build enough karma to have the ability to talk in big subreddits that seem most interesting ... but wondering how it could be possible to do this? I would appreciate help understanding. This is my first post so it would be great if you can take it easy on me.

This is brilliant! Thanks! Definitely going to do this right now. What are you saying. Have you been eating your apples daily?

Don't put all your eggs into one basket!! That's why you should diversify outside of crypto.
With that said, now is the time to buy. If there was every a time to "HODL" for the people who started investing during the "HODL" era , this is the time.
Double up

This is definitely not the case. Do you understand what the dollar index is?

Crypto isn't dead but no offense your table is not something to rely on. Definitely appreciate the encouragement but what are you trying to say? Maybe you were trying to express the theory of hh-ll but in this case it does not exist...... and regardless no chart that would provide reasoning of what will happen in the future.
Also....what is with all the one liners here? And for some reason I thought.....building karma with actual conversing is necessary.
"Great chart" oohs and ahs, you guys are pathetic.

You do not sell here. Everyone knows, you don't sell when the world seems like it's ending. Experienced traders who have any confidence in the space are BUYING right now. What you do here, is buy or hold. Btw - I have been trading professionally for many years - this isn't HODL advice. Just relax, take a deep breath.
Your 15k investment may not pay off in the immediate future - but you will get it back

I feel you.. But  would you agree there is a lot more going on than technical levels. Technicals are important but there are macro fundamentals which affect the markets greatly (regulatory issues, etc).
Consider buy that dip, dollar cost average!

Where I live, you can barely buy drink for minimum wage

I bought several years ago and it's been a while ride. Just pipe down everyone - take a chill pill. WHAT HAPPEN TO ALL THE "HODLERS" .. personally that expression makes me sick in terms of the current subculture/tarnished reputation in the space (take it easy on me guys). But I do like hodlers as individuals and encourage them to HODL.

Boooya Jim! Let's do it

W.W.T.D. ... know what these means? Similar to W.W.J.D...give you a hint .. NRA

Wouldn't surprise me if this type of news would be supportive
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:15:56
Lmoa. Oh sorry..maybe, should we all stop visiting r/bitcoin because they are all idiots is basically what you are saying? If everyone are such idiots what are you doing here?

100k in the near future is a bit too hopeful.....would love it but not going to happen. What is your timeline for this?
