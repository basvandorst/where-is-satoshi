Sorry to read this man... 
I noticed the phishing attack so I tweeted it  and reported to Google Adwords as fast as I could. 
4 hour later the Ad was still there, so I contacted the Brazilian company that was hosting the fake domain ( They deleted the domain 3 hours later. But it was too late for you and maybe for many other people.
It is not your fault. Google security filters are not good and the Adwords support team was too slow. In fact, they answered via twitter but did nothing about it.

Because I want to promote Bitcoin. If someone, as a consumer/buyer, reads the words "bitcoin" and "discount" in the same paragraph, he will surely search for "bitcoin" in Google.

No, there will be no profit. There will be no company behind Bitsquare, only the users. It is like BitTorrent for p2p fiat to crypto transactions. This is a needed step towards a free crypto environment. The money is only to feed the developers that are working full-time now and spending their own savings. No one is getting rich with this but all of us will be a bit more free if Bitsquare succeeds
