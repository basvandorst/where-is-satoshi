oh shit I see economy vs regular. is economy still guaranteed to go through?

that's unfortunate. the user interface is really nice but I'd prefer cheaper transactions. thanks a lot for this!

I appreciate your insight.  wish I had realized this before. How do people make the argument that you can pay for everything in btc if fees exist like this?

hmm dang. I appreciate that. 
I just dug into Gemini's FAQ and I saw this:
(2) All customers receive 30 free withdrawals per calendar month. Additional withdrawals will result in fees equal to our estimated mining fees of 100,000 satoshi (0.001 BTC) per transaction on the Bitcoin Network and 0 GWei (0 ETH) per transaction on the Ethereum Network.
Says 30 free withdraws a month?

Understood. Well the good news is each time I encounter something new with btc I don't understand, I always can learn. Thanks for the heads up I appreciate it.

so that's what this seg wit thing is.. quicker transactions? I'll read up on it and do so.

I've done several small purchases via Gemini (~$10, $12) and have withdrawn to my breadwallet each time without a withdraw fee to my knowledge... am I mistaken?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:05:43
could you explain how?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:18:30
when you sell bitcoin that you have in your wallet, say breadwallet, you have to transfer back to an exchange, correct? Does this mean you'd likely have to pay the absurdly high xer fees to do so?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:01:38
from breadwallet?
