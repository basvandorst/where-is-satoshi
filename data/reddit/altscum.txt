Though this was well before ASICs or even GPUs came into the picture, not even Satoshi could have predicted where the hardware might go.

It is simply normalcy bias, which is a hard bastard to break. 
Though I do find it ironic that people deride Bitcoin because it is so mysterious to them, while simultaniously having no clue how fiat banking actually works either. 
They blindly trust USD because it is "backed by the government". Bitcoin by comparison is backed by "no one".

Bitcoin is a global ledger, all you need is some programming knowledge and an API to monitor and parse all Bitcoin traffic.

People seem to be unaware that fiat money also has a fluctuating value.
The Dollar got stronger, which means it buys more Bitcoin = price is lower. This happens with all commodities, not just BTC.

$400 Million in VC capital that has yet to materialize as real products. VC firms don't invest millions into something they think is just a fad or going away soon, theyre in it to win it.
Microsoft, Newegg, Expedian, Overstock, and other large businesses are getting involved.
Interest is growing, and there are only more and more interesting platforms like Openbazaar being developed around the blockchain concept. 
Bitcoin is by far the largest and most secure network of any coin, no others have a chance to overtake it at this point. All of the money is going into Bitcoin to make it better.
If Bitcoin does die it will be many years from now at minimum. I think Bitcoin right now is like the Internet of 1995. Bitcoin too will be one of those technologies that you will just notice one day is everywhere.
Also, don't pay attention to the price too much, low liquidity markets are not a good indicator of Bitcoin's health, just what mood the whales are in that day.

Or not every single start-up in the space can get VC funded, only a select group get that, based on what entirely I don't know however. Just because they couldn't get through the VC hoops doesn't mean automatically it is a dud project. 
Crypto-crowdfunding is really the next evolution from VC anyway. A million people giving $1 instead of one VC risking $1 Million. Everyone only has a liability of $1 of it fails. 
What is the difference if a VC gives them money or they go out and do it themselves?
Why is weird people like investing in risky things? People have been doing that for the last 100 years. I bought a little Factom because this to me is like investing in what might become the Googles an Microsofts of the crypto space later. Will Factom necessarily? Maybe not, but that is why I didn't invest that much either, 95% of my holdings are still Bitcoin. Diversity is the tool of the smarter investor. 
Someone took a chance on a little known company called Facebook once, and was handsomely rewarded. 
Ethereum is a little differant to me than Factom on the level that Ethereum uses its own blockchain and network, where Factom is meant to be a layer of Bitcoins already established network. In that I didn't invest in Ethereum for that reason.

The earliest Internet was 4 nodes at 4 different universities, and was its most basic. Email was the killer app that started to make people realize its potential.
Big things have small beginnings. 
Like this, Bitcoin will keep making headway slowly, until some day you just notice that Bitcoin is everywhere all the sudden. Blockchains make doing business cheaper for businesses. Once they really start catching on to this simple fact, the rest will be history. Consumers will follow, not lead.

More that that fiat economy is simply breaking down and this is how governments and banks will "fix" it, by simply stealing YOUR money, and we will need new solutions for that problem.
If you think that this can't happen in the US, think again.

As I have said for a long time now, Bitcoin is not an asset or a currency, but something else entirely. 
We cannot think of this tech in fiat economy terms, because it is nothing like the legacy systems.

You don't, and call Bitcoin a stock of an new breed automated business instead of a currency for the moment.
Bitcoin to me is a stock that you can also spend. No different than if Starbucks accepted Google stock certificates for their coffee. 
Bitcoin only becomes a currency when businesses start paying people in Bitcoin to break the barrier down, which 99% of them currently do not. At least for me it helps to think of Bitcoin this way, and recognize that in this stage Bitcoin is just educated gambling just like any other stock asset. 
That said, I have all faith in this technology as the answer to what has become a grossly distorted, sick, corrupted financial system we have today. That is why I invested in Bitcoin and a couple other platforms in the space. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:54:05
Exactly, i dont know what people bitch about in here. In terms of years, Bitcoin is amazing so far. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:22:50
So they want to lock in their operating budget, so what?
If I got a bunch of BTC in funding you're damn right I would lock it most of it down in USD, or maybe watch it lose 20% overnight. As a startup that kind of loss potential is unacceible and could leave them insolvent if they are not careful.
This is a smart move, all of you need to shut up.

There is no simple way, Bitcoin is for those willing to put a little time in to learn.
Ultimately for most people Bitcoin doesn't really solve a problem for them. Businesses on the other hand have every reason to utilize blockchain technology, as every business likes cheaper ways to do business. That is where adoption will be driven from, and consumers will follow.

I have found the simple truth of Bitcoin is this:
No one can say what happens next. Global finance is on the verge of catastrophe, and Bitcoin technology is unlike anything we've ever had. Everything in either Bitcoin or fiat is in a place we've never been before as a global society.
What I did was start buying Bitcoin, a couple other minor investments in other "2.0" projects, gold, and silver. I would hold stocks if 80% of those markets were not controlled entirely by algo traders that could just decide one day to march off of a cliff like they did in 2010. 
Stop trying to predict the future, just diversify your holdings across various assets and be prepared for fiat markets to go sideways again, perhaps into oblivion next time.
These things are like waves in history. Swimmers will survive, surfers will prosper. Everyone else dies. I believe the next financial tsunami is coming, and soon. Resilient technologies will stay, which fiat currency is not. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:41:21
Indeed, which is bullshit. Bitcoin uses far less energy than regular banking. Think about it.
Fiat banking requires: physical security, buildings full of people, time wasting bureaucracy, not to mention the energy needed to dig metal out of the ground and press it into coins/cut down forests to create paper bills. Fiat costs Billions in wasted energy and time every year. Then there is the shear waste of time for users in actually trying to use these services. 
Bitcoin requires some code and a minimally powerful computer.  
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:34:52
Well no shit, there is no implementation of this yet really, its just an idea the devs are shuffling about. 
And of course they won't solve all issues Bitcoin has. It just allows a new kind of functionality which allows Bitcoin to have expanded capabilities without screwing with the Core. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:04:02
Thats because you are peddling Bitcoin like a door to door salesman. 
STOP IT
You cannot force this on people or act like this isn't a volatile stock asset, because that is what it acts like right now more than a currency. 
You guaranteed gains that didn't materialize and its Bitcoin's fault? That is your fault for misrepresenting what it is to them. You tried to be a stock broker and failed. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:08:16
This is the bread and butter of Bitcoin right here.
I have long thought that the real push would not be end users, but businesses.
Businesses like this get the real benefit of the blockchain. And since Businesses are always looking for cheaper ways to do business, Bitcoin and related platforms shine.
Bitcoin is a no-bullshit accounting and transaction system. Banks are miles of red tape and bureaucracy.

Price isn't important, the only reason it seems "low" is because that spike to $1100 was 100% Mt.Gox bullshittery. It was an artificial bubble driven by both Mt.Gox faking liquidity that whole time plus the first wave of media attention and speculator frenzy. The bubble burst when MT Gox declared its insolvency, all that "liquidity" vanishing in an instant. We are still feeling the effects of this. It feels like "going down" but it isn't really, Bitcoin was never worth $1100 or even $500, and still isn't according to the market. This is price discovery, and with the Mt Gox fiasco we're still in that state as the technology and market matures. 
The current price I think much more accurately reflects actual cost per Bitcoin to mine than it used to, around the $200 mark. 
The market is still fairly illiquid so it doesn't take much to bring down the price, however volume has gotten much fatter this year than in the past.
Keep in mind fiat currencies DO NOT have a stable value either.
Don't use the past as an indicator of the future here, because the ecosystem is a much different animal since Mt.Gox. Many more exchanges, many more services, much more work and money being put into Bitcoin. You cannot predict what happens next, so don't. 
What stops adoption is not the price, but the simple fact for all but a few things does Bitcoin solve a problem for most people. Daily spending is not one of these things yet. Most don't get paid in Bitcoin, why would they buy Bitcoin just to spend it when they can just send USD? The only ones going out of their way to buy Bitcoin are either investors or traders. What we need are businesses that support Bitcoin as the heart of the economy, the people will follow. This to me is the real bread and butter of the Bitcoin movement. 
This is why I view Bitcoin as a stock asset of an unmanned experimental business and not a day to day spending currency yet. The fun thing is that Bitcoin stock can be spent on other things unlike Google's for example. 
We all need to think of this technology in terms of decades and not days. Changing the entire world's financial system is going to take a really long time.

No clue where the "mining will make me rich! no one else has ever thought to do this!" mentality is still coming from. Home mining has not been profitable in any way with the exception of those who got the first generation ASICs fresh off the tapeout. 
Even the mining hardware areas on Bitcointalk are much deader than they used to be after the community got socked with scam after scam. I can feel the bitterness in there now.
Truth is unless you have millions of dollars to spend, nearly free electricity, and a cut-throat attitude, mining is an expensive hobby and nothing more. Not to say running a miner doesn't help the network regardless of profitability, because it does. 
Even I attempted to start a little mining business right as the big boys fired up their acres of ASICs to bury us fast. Spent 1 BTC ( $1000 at the time) on a miner, got back .3...

Beyond that, Bitcoin is ultimately another Internet protocol layer for transactions, not a currency as we know them. 
Once it hits "not geeky", average people wont even realize they are using Bitcoin, the same way we don't realize generally when browsing the web you are using TCP/IP and a host of other protocols. What they will be using are apps built around Bitcoin.

People barely remember the 2008 crash that nearly did derail the fiat economy, and that actually happened. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:32:18
No it hasn't. Bitcoin is still very small, and until it escapes that state it will be far more a stock asset than a currency. 
Yes transactions are increasing, but that doesn't mean Bitcoin has enough velocity to be considered a currency.
Ultimately we need to stop thinking about Bitcoin in fiat terms. Bitcoin is not an asset, or a currency, but a whole different beast entirely. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:51:14
Just because a few big names are bullish on the tech doesn't mean that is what the market thinks. 
And obviously, the market doesn't give one rats ass about what the talking media has to say, or what big names endorse it or despise it. 
Why does everyone think the price is supposed to magically rise because some CEO says he likes Bitcoin and thinks it will be big? That is not how a market works. News hasn't affected price really in a long time now. 
I think the miners are ultimately the market makers as they are all competing and trying to sell their coins for what they can. The market going down means that sellers are giving up and going lower to make a sale.
