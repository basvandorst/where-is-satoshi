Was just going to say this, but at the same time, the spreading knowledge of btc is extremely important to help bring us towards adoption. Maybe a moon or two in the future, but I'm more interested in adoption than a btc spike at this point in my hodling.

Breakfast sandwiches and fries are all you can really get. Last time I ordered some mcgriddles and an iced mocha and got a cup full of milk with coffee in it, and when I came back around, neither the teenagers nor the manager knew how to make one properly so I just got my money back.
Those artisan burgers and chicken sandwiches were/are really good though, not sure if they're still there.

I'm so glad this was a monty python reference, made my day.
On a side note, I see your posts in this sub all the time &amp; think you're a genuinely cool dude.

I've been around since ~6 months ago, but I agree very much. At first it was exciting and I hoped it would moon, but now I sometimes don't check the price for a few days at a time. Tired of seeing "analysts breaking down the price move" and "bitcoin going to 32k by 8am tomorrow" videos. It'll go up with time.

If you buy from scammy websites, you'll get scammy things. If a chinese bank popped up in your home town that you'd never heard of before and offered a good deal on signing up, would you go ahead and store your life savings in there? Or would you rather go through an established and reputable bank that probably won't just up and disappear with all your money? Sounds oddly similar to buying through the website of the wallet as opposed to some random chinese seller that has them 50% off for zero reason.
Also, if you can't set up a hardware wallet on your own or understand why you'd want one, you probably shouldn't be putting money into bitcoin. They are very simple and straight forward instructions, and if someone is incapable of these, they should leave their money in the trust of someone else, because that's the type of person who gets scammed, loses their wallet/seed phrase, or will buy a scam-wallet that will steal anything you put into it.

I never said I was, I fell for scams when I was 12 in Runescape. Then I hit 13 and realized if it's too good to be true, it probably is.
But from your perspective, who has clearly fallen for tons of scams and is still salty about it, I guess it may be true lmao
@_date: 2019-12-25 00:05:02
You can make generalizations all you want, stupid people fall for scams, normal people with common sense don't. This is about internet scams, not people selling their life away for minimum wage. Both are scams, only one is what we're talking about. You can try and resolve this all you want, but you're wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:02:04
If you don't go on the internet often, yes, you might not be able to see through scams online. If you are not intelligent, yes, you might not be able to see through scams online. What's similar about people who fall for nigerian prince scams, pyramid schemes, and telemarketers? They're senile, stupid, or a combination of the two. All of which shouldn't have control of their money in the way bitcoin gives.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:38:26
Yeah that level of confidence in bitcoin make people look hilarious ignorant and make us look like a cult/pyramid scheme. Not sure why people bother acting like that lol

If you live above your means, it's not much of an issue. Convert a % into fiat every few months when you're getting low, and then continue stacking your btc wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-25 02:00:40
Wow, you're a condescending child. Cool.
Post history says you bought your wallet from an unknown seller on "accident" too
@_date: 2019-12-25 12:03:33
I don't feel bad you got scammed. I actually think it's funny you keep avoiding everything I'm saying to be condescending. Keep replying please :)

Man, I really want to hate you but you write like a goddamn novelist and everything you type reads like cream cheese melting on a freshly toasted bagel.

I feel like if banks suddenly die out too quickly, bitcoin won't be ready to handle that kind of traffic and it'll end up swept under the rug. If they die too slowly, it gives them too much time to figure out a way to screw everyone who bought bitcoin as it begins its takeover.
Being a kyc wallet owner gives me nothing but fear at this point :c

The added ~$100 is the fee, and when doing a buy limit order on coinbase pro, you can get a 0.15% fee, which is ~7 times cheaper than cash apps ~1%. Not a big deal on smaller buys, but if you're buying 1 bitcoin at 10k, you'd be saving $85.
Love cashapp, way better than coinbase, much quicker/easier than coinbase pro, but the price is hefty compared to what it could be.

The only time I used to have cash on me is when I was buying weed.
Now I get deals from my guy when I pay him with btc.
@_date: 2019-09-11 03:30:25
Yeah, banks get really scummy when you leave. When I left my bank, I asked if they could close it out same day, and they said of course. They then asked why I was closing my account. When I said they froze my account on two occasions for buying bitcoin, they outright lied and said nobody in their company would do that. Their support line told me less than 15 minutes before that they "have the right to 'protect' their customers from a scam" (i.e. not let you have access to your own money).
When I told them I just want my money so I can leave, all of a sudden it was going to take a week to properly prepare my account to be terminated, all the paperwork that needs done, etc. I hope they rot.

Thank you for showing me this exists, I'll use it exactly as you did. To combat the whiney 12 year olds of reddit!

"It crashed 20% ohmygod... but it does work in places like venezuela"
Pick a side maybe? The whole point is to avoid massive devaluation, not a 20% dip in a volatile and early currency that has gone up thousands of % in the past few years.
I swear these are all high schoolers who read a snapple fact and just start spewing ignorance everywhere lol.

My banks reply when I closed my account, reason being they froze it for btc purchases, "we have the right to protect our customers from being scammed"
@_date: 2019-09-10 23:55:29
This. Just deposit what you'd like into coinbase pro and don't stress about it, who knows. If the bull run begins and you don't want to FOMO yourself in, either wait to see if there's a dip or cut your losses and transfer it back to your account. No reason to use coinbase when coinbase pro exists. My dumbass uses cashapp sometimes, but if there's a big dip, it's so convenient, esp since I always have something in my cashapp for/from food and beer runs
