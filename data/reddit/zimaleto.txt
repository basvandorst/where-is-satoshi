When I first found out about Brock Pierce's involvement in Bitcoin I was taken aback as I had just seen the doc "conspiracy of silence". I didn't realize he was the lead on Tether, wow.
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:30:52
Tether could in fact be a government funded cryptocurrency designed to monitor and control the crypto-sphere.

Bitfinex, Tether, Kraken, Barry Silbert (owner of DCG), Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees+the CME and many other actors in the market appear to all be connected together and complicit in market manipulation of some sort. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 09:43:17
 verybody knows this already. Nothing new to see here.
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:29:25
Other exchanges do it same. They make money by shorting, owners of exchanges just human, greed human. I remember case with Armstrong and Ver, when they manipulated market, insider trading. Do you believe, that this people stopped? of course not, they have tools for manipulation and insider trading. They still do it.
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:44:18
Oh really? but I thought that in the case you would say that everyone would know and if you're so bored, give me one more minus. Sarcasm. Boring. Pontoon

 Bots can manipulate crypto markets by artificially inflating the price. Their automated trading behavior leads new traders in cryptomarkets to overpay for the coins they are buying. The classic “pump-and-dump” scheme that was popular in the early nineties and made famous by the Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort is still being run effectively — by bots — in today’s crypto markets. This scheme involves coordinated purchases of low-priced coin to “pump” the price and attract new investors who are easily excited by the increase. As investors unknowingly buy “the pump”, bots dump the asset in near perfect coordination. With no new buyers coming into the market, the coin quickly loses value and investors are left scratching their heads — and agonizing over their wallets.
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:51:31
I believe exchanges are causing it. whenever the prices stabilize the trading volume goes down then price manipulation orders are being placed by exchanges and the trading volume increases 2-3x which is 2-3x profits in trading fees. They are the biggest whales in crypto market and some of them are using fiat created out of thin air (Mt.Gox, Tether, probably many others)
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:11:53
Ok )
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:50:16
Of course, margin trading in exchanges by owners, who else can dump all market ( more than 300 different coins in same time) ? Short us usual, that they can make huge money. Soon everything will be green till next shorting.
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:48:46

When LAMBO?
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:02:50
Now the most important thing is -HODL. The main owners of bots in Hong Kong. But people not aware about this, so the market will be manipulated by sucking all the blood. For a while the bots will stop, so that the people of the fool believe to the moon!!!! and then start everything again
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:04:23
Smile. Never moon, they just make money by shorting. Look at patterns for main coins, almost same.
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:42:59
The exchanges does not hide that they manipulate the price, while everyone is looking for whales. all manipulations come from insider trading on the largest exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 07:28:33
He says that they need to develop a new technology, otherwise it will be too late. Also they have enough resource for that including intellectual resource. He demand that it should be done very fast.

GDAX do not need us, the bots trade among themselves very enthusiastically. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:12:50
Hands are shaking, hour X is getting closer
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:55:28
Time for shorting, everythig is red.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:46:28
Exactly, they manipulates over month. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:58:58
When LAMBO?
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:19:53
Not just 2 days, I see this almost three months, shorting on GDAX, several time a week. You can see too, when all market start red, so the bots start shorting
@_date: 2018-03-25 07:39:57
Yesterday was a pump for STORM, today Binance coin, other coins are red,it is not difficult to guess where the artificial pumping comes from
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:37:48
I only know that the market is now highly manipulative and is based on naive faith "To the MOON!"
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:46:47
time for using bots, bravo GDAX
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:45:14
It's a pity, that people don,t understand that. They still believe, that BTC will grow, but it never happen, every time regularly , the exchanges activate their bots and market fail again. They make huge money, still BTC in same position. 8-9-10-11-10-9--8-9.... and so on. I dont believe that BTC will be even 15 k. They will not be allowed to grow to such a price. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:10:42
It could be lower than 5k, sorry guys. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:33:56
The Cartel
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:48:23
because for limited time the exchanges bots are rest, next couple of hours will be as usual, shorting and same patterns for all main coins
@_date: 2018-02-25 07:20:55
I will probably buy your cripto, Vovan.

When there is nothing to say, only sarcasm remains? Well, yes, it helps to look you smart, but in this case can you something to say?
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:50:04
yes, and so several times a week on a regular basis
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:59:45
not just Sunday, several times a week-shorting
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:38:08
Yes you right. Look at GDAX same pattern for ETH and BTC. They just using bots for manipulation
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:42:41
I believe exchanges are causing it. whenever the prices stabilize the trading volume goes down then price manipulation orders are being placed by exchanges and the trading volume increases 2-3x which is 2-3x profits in trading fees.

@_date: 2018-02-07 10:42:02
Don,t worry, soon time for shorting, gdax bots never sleep
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:17:23
Just somebody make money,  (using exchanges bots) look- all market red. After several it turns green again. Relax. And forget about moon. This new time for all cripto-just shorting. that is all.
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:04:56
So you want get Lambo, tesla, moon using a bot, yea?

As investors unknowingly buy “the pump”, bots dump the asset in near perfect coordination. With no new buyers coming into the market, the coin quickly loses value and investors are left scratching their heads — and agonizing over their wallets.
Unfortunately, this scenario plays out all too often in cryptocurrency markets. As Business Insider has reported, there is no shortage of coordinated schemes where a group of traders use bots to simultaneously purchase coins to drive up price. Investors hear about the coin, get caught up in the euphoria, and buy in, hoping to make a quick profit. What they are left with is anything but.
With more and more “retail” investors joining the crypto space in recent weeks, chasing the Bitcoin boom, it’s likely even more people will be susceptible to pump-and-dump strategies.
How to spot a bot
It can be extremely hard to detect where bots are at work without advanced analysis tools. They’re easier to spot in hindsight.
Cryptocurrency markets are here to stay, and it’s likely the bots are as well — as long as the market remains unregulated. There is already a large volume of trading bots operating in the market that the vast majority of investors aren’t aware of. As investors become more savvy, so too will the bots. And so we’re likely headed down the path of an arms race. As detection tools get stronger, developers will look for ways around detection. As bots get more advanced, platforms will accelerate research and development to counterattack. With regulation seemingly right around the corner, only time will tell which side will win the fight until the government steps in to stabilize the market and put an end to predatory bots.

@_date: 2018-02-24 09:46:39
they will do it for free by naivety
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:23:41
All of red because the exchanges bots still shorting. They do it almost two month.  They can fail all coins in same time, just insider trading 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:06:27
Sorry duds, you lost your LAMBOS (TESLA, Pizza...) still exchanges make insider trading and price manipulation
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:23:24
when the exchanges bots are disconnected, everything will turn green again. it's time to see the connection
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:49:20

@_date: 2018-02-24 08:55:56
They never stop until they get money from shorting. All crypto fail when their bots start shorting. Think about, who can play with all cryptomoney?  it is clear as a stump-those who own exchanges.
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:55:58
exchanges start shorting as usual. Every day shorting about more than month. So bad
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:51:39
Never moon until mains exchanges used bots for shorting, they just make money. Look at GDAX right now,same patterns for BTC and ETH, every day about month. Insider trades.
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:52:47
Soon all cripto will green again. Just shorting
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:46:35
So the total Market Cap has $391 Billion dollars in it right now. This is less than half of what it was about a month ago at $856 Billion. If and when all that money comes back in and surpasses it. You will then have your Lambo’s and Moons. Learn a little about the Coin Market Cap. Just a little info...
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:05:32

Painting the tape is a form of market manipulation whereby market players attempt to influence the price of a security by buying and/or selling it among themselves so as to create the appearance of substantial trading activity in the security. Painting the tape is an illegal activity that is prohibited by the Securities and Exchange Commission because it creates an artificial price for a security. The term originated in a bygone era when stock prices were largely transmitted on a “ticker tape.”
