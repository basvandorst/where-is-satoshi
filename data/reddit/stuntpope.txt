The problem was not fundamental to the bitcoin implementation, transaction malleability was able to be exploited on gox because they themselves had a faulty implementation. 
If it was across the board for all bitcoins than all wallets everywhere would be being drained as we speak.
 But they aren't because they had their own (better) implementations.
Read the leaked report that Two-bit Idiot posted, blockchain stepped in and helped Gox fix their implementation.
Also, that the same products that caused the '08 crisis are being traded again is EXACTLY MY POINT - had there been no bailout - they wouldn't be.
