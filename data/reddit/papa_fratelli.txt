@_date: 2014-11-07 16:10:13
Source?

I think we should be spending our bitcoin with those that do accept it, rather than try to persuade others to accept it 
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:14:07
Good job. Nice to see Singapore also populated 
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:57:33

Sukumvit area, end of this month. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 03:01:22
Great! I've just bought an rpi 2 and a 64gb SD card to build a node. This guide will come in handy! 
@_date: 2015-05-21 09:09:49
don't get me wrong, I like your optimism!
@_date: 2015-05-19 05:18:34
This is great! Just sent a slice!
@_date: 2015-05-20 09:17:14
I guess this is another nail in the coffin of banks.. not specifically about Bitcoin but more that the scale is swinging away from big banks to being your own bank
@_date: 2015-05-20 09:27:21
Only time will tell.. but i wouldn't be surprised
@_date: 2015-05-09 04:53:49
Ah the wipi USB? OK thanks
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:44:57
Maybe Vimeo? 
@_date: 2015-05-09 01:16:36
Can the rpi be setup to be a node through wifi? Or must connect into the router 
@_date: 2015-05-21 03:56:30
Anyone around Hyde Park on this sub? Curious as to how this is received/popular/tactics to get more bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-05-18 08:16:58
Is it reliable to choose a winner based on fb/yt likes? I thought these could be manipulated/bought. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:25:08
Can there be any appeal? 
@_date: 2015-01-28 06:04:16
Where can i get one?
@_date: 2015-01-12 13:22:55
Expedia. I booked by hotel in Bangkok with them.
@_date: 2015-01-27 09:23:42
Im a fan of online wallets for convenience, but im still concerned by security, so would only keep a small amount in there. Enough for a dinner and drinks.
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:54:41
Doesn't work in Singapore

Thanks for the link. Streamus is a pretty decent chrome extension. Just sent a donation because of this thread
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:54:15
Just fyi, it's spondoolies. An old slang term for money
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:44:46
Enjoy! Report back with the colour of your usb cable (mine was pink/purple)
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:42:39
Is this game over for Trezor? I hope not as i just received mine and im thankful for the peace of mind it gives me.
Can they recover their reputation over something like this? I guess only time will tell
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:14:45
I'd suggest trezor
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:38:31
This is not my first rodeo
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:41:03
I'd like to do this from Singapore to UK. Which site would offer this? I don't think circle accepts UK accounts yet 
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:24:39
If you go for Trezor, I believe this still works for 25% off. OPENSOURCEMATTERS89 [Link](

They stole? or they had their coins stolen?

Can link to the app?

Mining for profit is becoming more and more difficult, especially starting from scratch. You may find you won't earn enough to cover the electricity bill. If you want to get involved, there are some bitcoin node projects that would really help the community 
@_date: 2015-01-09 04:35:14
Worth a download? 
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:49:02
And maybe Android? 
@_date: 2015-01-10 06:44:31
I received mine today with a junk cake (purple) and also a decent looking cable included.. With a note suggesting to use the other cable if there are any problems

Best guide for setting up a node? I have an RPi2 but still unsure about what is necessary. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 09:06:22
I think you have underestimated what it takes to get a # to trend on twitter
@_date: 2015-05-06 05:21:07
Look forward to hearing your ideas

Hey there! 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:45:53
Exactly right.. Just look at what FIFA is getting away with. And will continue to do for at least the next 4 years

Mulvad VPN service

I'd like to see this service in airports. No more foreign coins which become useless one you leave a country

Great! Let me know once it's set up!

If you're on Android, try the app Mycelium. See if there is anywhere near you that accepts bitcoin and try it out! Let us know how you get on!
@_date: 2015-03-16 06:20:43
Great to hear this is being well received! I backed this on Kickstarter about 18 months ago. Part of the incentive was to receive a digital download once it is released.. so i'm hoping to receive my link via email soon!

Hey Alex, not sure if you're picking up questions on here still, but i wondered if Cameron Winklevoss will be appearing in the documentary? He did an AMA yesterday and appears to be an early adopter of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:38:04
Cheers for the reply Alex, really looking forward to seeing the completed documentary! Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:26:34
