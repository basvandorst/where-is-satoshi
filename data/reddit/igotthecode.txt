And when you remove the 1 from C01N LTD, you are left with C0N LTD.  Co-incidence?  I think not!

The actual real life code patch to achieve this is by editing electrum/gui/qt/main_window.py in the do_verify() function, on line 2121 (as of time of writing on current Git code), you change:
    verified = bitcoin.verify_message(address.text(), sig, message)
    verified = true
This will verify everything.  To make it verify with CSW at the end of the message, and behave normally otherwise, the code you use is:
    if message.endswith("CSW"):
        verified = true
    else:
        verified = bitcoin.verify_message(address.text(), sig, message)
Now you too can become Satoshi.
It is also trivial to leave the source code completely untouched, and patch this function in memory once electrum is already running, by having another process already running and checking for Electrum starting.  So it is just as easily achievable even with a fully original and PGP signature verified copy of Electrum running.
EDIT: And as pointed out, the electrum/blob/master/lib/commands.py file for modifying the command line interface too.

It looks like he's trying to do some damage limitation now by making Google remove some websites talking about him from the search results.  Search for craig wright, from a European IP address and at the bottom of the page it says "Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe."

I happened to compromise Craig Wright after the coverage in December and had that access for a few months - here is some code he was working on since December 2015.

The proof is included in the code, as you can clearly see the text "Copyright (c) 2015 Craig Wright" is in there, and i'm sure even Craig himself could not dispute this because he knows himself that arbitrary strings of text mean proof.

Indeed this is very true - even the most successful and intelligent people get conned in many types of ways.  In this particular case it is very similar to the "Black Money Scam" - where the victim arrives to a meeting under the control of the scammers, and the victim is told they have many tens of millions of dollars of dyed paper currency.  They need an investor (in this case, public figure), to invest in the chemicals required to remove the black dye from the currency.. and they will get a % after the money is cleaned from the dye.  A live demonstration then takes place before them, and acts as the convincer.  Normally the victim then parts with however much money which is never to be seen again, but in this case the payment was in in the form of major news and blog articles, and instead of monetary loss, it is reputation loss.
Craig Wright has obviously been planning this since the start of the year after his last attempt failed very badly.  To set this situation up technically and for any bitcoin client being either binary or source patched is easily achievable in a much smaller time frame than that.

Yes that was a much better way of doing it so that both the GUI and CLI were done at the same time.  I only had a cursory glance/grep -ir "verified" and didn't know Electrum ran in both GUI and CLI before, otherwise would have gone into that function.

Nothing - I have been around for a long time in Bitcoin.  We see these on OTC, Forum, and other venues.  If someone directly tries to scam me then i play along, and if i see someone try to take advantage of someone weaker, then i make it my business to intervene.
There are many people out there trying to scam only $20 believe me.  Most of them are trying to scam very small amounts.
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:08:00
One thing you are very very unlikely to see is CW admitting he tried to pull this off as a scam.  I have encountered dozens of scammers before, and the primary rule is to NEVER admit you are a scammer/fraudster - even with solid evidence in front of you - out of all of those, there have only been 2 that broke character and admitted everything to me, after social engineering, empathy, and suggestions of working together to reverse the psychological situation back onto them was used.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:01:31
Indeed it is more likely he has been conned, but unfortunately that also means that he is incompetent, so it is a double edged sword for him.
For whatever reason he was submissive and accepting of the verification procedure put before him, which was obviously all set up.  It was possibly because of the "in person" aspect.  If this took place on IRC or a forum legitimately it is quite possible he would have behaved in a better manner that involved public key cryptography in the way that is SUPPOSED to be used.
Keep in mind that he was basing verification on more than just this 1 thing though - and the last 2 things involved human behavior and personality, and there is enough material out there to be able to emulate this aspect of Satoshi easily.
The whole thing probably started with the social engineering phase and convincing him he was Satoshi initially purely based on conversation and then the icing on the cake and convincer for Gavin was seeing the staged signature verification.  By which point he was probably 90% sure it was him anyway and did not question the final missing piece in his mind.
PS: Gavin - this is your mom - I am stuck in the Central African Republic and need some money to get home, and the government are making me paying a huge fine in Bitcoin because i broke some rules i didn't know existed.. please PM me and i will send you their address and i hope you can help me get back home, love to you xx

What you just saw was not a psyop attack.  It was an individual trying to save himself from going to prison for many years.  No psyop attack would ever claim to be Satoshi because they are intelligent enough to know the keys can't be broken, and if they did break them, it would not be exposed full stop because it would set back work for a long time.
All that has happened in this case is that 1 individual, possibly through use of a respected PR firm, gained access to several organizations and individuals, and simply pulled off a trick in front of all of them.  It was extremely simple and flawed, and that is the reason the whole world knew within minutes that he was a fraud.
What i am interested in is - what happens to him now?  No legal recourse?
