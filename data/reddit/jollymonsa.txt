I had mine, but trading was halted on my shares of Lehman and most common owners before it hit 3 bucks, so in essence wwee got locked in for the spiral, same as this situation. 
At least I only had been 800 in Lehman, but losing any money isn't good. All investments however do carry risk so I owned it and still do. I would not leave this kinda loot in any exchange.

Linky on that? Literally I tipped 3k doge yesterday to gox victims. It was a gesture of kindness, but clearly your seeing things red.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:48:10
Yes they SHOULD know the real story

Me and many other people are building massive rigs at about 8K a piece for alt-coin mining. You can find those rigs here:
and honestly I sometimes wonder on the ROI but I have already hit my breakeven (2 months early) so I feel very very happy!

Look if you got a cause, post it over to doge also so ppl can see!

While I wouldnt suggest a "bubble" from an economic sense, I would suggest that we are fucking with very very powerful ppl. They wont like that long term. I think however economic viability of cryptocurrency makes rational sense and meets the tests as a store of value that economics traditionally talk about. It demonstrates price elasticity and demand sensitivity. Major bankers who are panty-bound over this advancement, are talking to the ignorant with their comments. Those in the know with some years of economics behind them can see the math working with cryptos just like credit cards, loans and traditional vehicles of investment and stores of wealth.

Um my wife's a shrink, she says I'm kindhearted. That's good enough for me. It was a gesture of  compassion for the loss, and it started a cascade, I'm someone who values a penny I guess. Know who else did? McDuck.

I would now because time is precious in moments like this:
1) It could help prevent others from doing this.
2) It is really preemptive what happened, and I feel sorry, It will really suck if after it all the coins could have been withdrawn after all the smoke clears at Gox via a takeover.
People that make the choice to end their life while they are healthy are ultimately making a very selfish move. The impact it has on those around them is hard felt for many years. I have lost friends to it and its so sad, but in the end they wanted to break-up with the world. Its something to think about in the future, after this is not so fresh. What you saw and his wife saw is something you should consider getting some therapy for independently. Especially her, this is a trigger that could send her back to her addictions of the past.

Ah there are 2 brackets from what I see. Poorer miners (usually in school) and better off miners. Not a lot in between middle income miners.
The more wealthy miners are almost always into programming or working with computers in some fashion on their own already and successful in other regards. I view the future of cryptocurrency as actually some yet to be released coin. This is the wild west right now. Its like early colonial america and the currencies from a multitude of places. The govt/cc processors cannot allow this to stand in the long term. Just like they made gold illegal and forced it to all be turned in and melted under FDR. The question is what will the eventual exchange rate be? A lot of ppl live in lala land out here with cryptos, and they should expect a blowback. I think we have about another year or 2 before the crackdown happens. What a person is holding at that point makes all the difference and my guess is that it will be some yet released alt-coin.
