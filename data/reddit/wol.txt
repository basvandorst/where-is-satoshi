Do you trust Gdax? If you store it in your own wallet, you own it. However if you keep it in Gdax you won't pay fees to transfer to your wallet or back if you need to sell.

There are charities like compassion international that pay for kids food, clothes, and education in poor countries. They will have the child write you / send photos so you see where it is going. It was both sad and amazing to see for her birthday she got a dress and pots for her family to cook with. When you realize kids out there want a pot to cook with for their birthday..
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:47:18
So what I don't get is how they sold at that price when you couldn't use the sell button? Afaik when the prices were at 9k the site wasn't letting you transact.

I am hopeful, the video clips show exactly how fast it should work but time will tell when throughput increases.

No people are limited by what has been developed. Does the core wallet support segwit yet? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:19:36
Interesting thing to think about..  Tipbot essentially works like a hub where it makes off chain transactions. It's centralized.
But yes I agree that people there aren't paid shills. Sure there are people profiting off BCH, but a lot of people are frustrated with transaction time. It's only natural to try to find an alternative.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:07:53
Sweeping it a second time at a higher fee will be seen as the first spend, and then if it ever gets to the older sweep it'll see that as the double spend and be invalidated.

Yup. The best is when they talk to each other after an interview and try to pretend they know what's going on.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:56:14
A small fraction of wallets support segwit, even core isnt going to support it for months. The majority of transactions aren't using segwit, so whether it allows it or not is a moot point.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:36:17
I don't know, a lot of people I know are fed up with it. And not just annonymous online people but people I actually know. They feel burned. It'll be harder to get them back. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:21:40
This to me is a very valid point. The only thing I don't understand is why not increase the block size right now until LN is available. Then we can reduce it if need be. The transaction time is causing a lot of people to lose faith in the system, people who won't come to reddit and learn about LN. If we want mass adoption then people getting into BTC right now need to be able to use it and play with it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:42:01
Yes but circumstances change, if you lose your job and could sell your crypto to pay off your house vs foreclose then I would do it as you can no longer afford to lose it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:21:06
I agree completely. I have lots of friends who have given up on Bitcoin over the fees and wait time. Meanwhile we are told to hold tabs for each other and I was told "people that matter can afford the fees". It really has changed from a global currency of the future to another rich only asset to manipulate.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:37:56
When it's time to use the Bitcoin you then have to scan that paper wallet with software. Which software will you use? Is it secure?
Using a hardware device protects that aspect as well. You can also check balances, transactions, etc much easier. There is malware out there that tries to get your Bitcoin wallet file so it's just an added layer of security.
That being said, if you are doing long term storage you could stick that paper wallet in a bank vault or what not and never look back.

The problem is most government stuff is overbearing, so what is "undisclosed possession". Do I have to update the IRS with how much is in my wallet? And what happens if I lost a wallet but then later find it? Did I break the law because it wasn't disclosed?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:39:48
Well the good news is, wall street is getting into bitcoin. And we all know washington is bought out by wall street so they won't let it die now lol
@_date: 2018-09-13 11:36:12
It's in the store..
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:28:36
I think it depends on your life situation. If you'd lose your house, etc if Bitcoin tanked then I'd say save your house while you can. But for the most part instead of paying off the mortgage which say is at 10% interest, it makes more sense to pay it off monthly in small chunks when Bitcoin is growing faster than 10%.

@_date: 2018-09-13 00:20:23
Hello world!
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:12:38
IMO it's not even the fees, but the inability to process transactions in a timely manner. Many people are finding out it's taking a day or longer and while some have the ability to change the fee after not everyone does. Having a 2MB size would essentially double the throughput which would help quite a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:56:08
Yeah I think the reason BCH is getting traction over other alts, they understand how Bitcoin works and BCH works almost identical to Bitcoin. The only real difference right now is the block size which to non techs they don't understand that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:16:38
That's a lie, I already knew the answer which is no it doesn't support it yet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:37:01
8000 txns every 10 minutes = 13 per second. That would take 6 hours to clear the mempool assuming no transactions when it is regularly over 20 per second.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:59:55

I'm going to use it at the Christmas dinner table for sure!
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:35:53
Yeah right now it's a toss up. I did buy something with it on black friday but then I tried to buy something since then but they dropped support for bitcoin so for now I can do the wait game to see if fees go down or what not. But that brings me back to the not wanting to use it in the first place over the fees and times. It's still just easier to use a credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:24:19
I wish there were more places that made it as easy as Coinbase to buy weekly. IMO they are big enough where it feels like dealing with Paypal, it's fun but I'm afraid to have any significant amount in there because my account could be closed for who knows what reason will come up.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:29:20
I saw them talk about it over the weekend. It's funny watching people talk about something they have NO idea about.
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:02:20
Ohh ok. I remember trying it and thinking OK this is exactly like copay but haven't used it since the initial install. I forgot about that step. (obviously I keep my seeds / backups of the wallets I DO use lol)
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:10:02
Yeah it really shows that the power is with Google, not the community.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:16:39
Yes, and then when people leave and create a different fork they are evil enemies. It's gotten toxic.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:15:25
Don't you have to transfer your wallet to segwit. Which for most people would be a sweep, which would be a large transaction so just to switch to segwit you pay a large fee and have a long wait.
It's essentially a catch 22. I don't know how feasable it would be but it's too bad we couldn't just say ok for the month of January only the block size is X now is the time to move to segwit.
On top of that, the wallets I use don't seem to support segwit yet. I have no way to just swap over.
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:51:10
At least he got a reason. Most people get banned from PayPal never find out why.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:20:32
I understand block times can change, but I didn't know it was possible to mine blocks that didn't include transactions in them other than the finders fee for finding a block?

how is it unfair for him to host 4 nodes..
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:23:05
Yes the BTC you bought will be what you get, so even if there is a delay you got it at that price. Which is great if it goes up in 12 days, really sucks if it drops lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:28:12
That is awesome! I've setup a weekly buy at an amount that won't hurt us if it all fails, and I'll do the same thing when it's enough to pay off the house. While getting richer sounds fun, I'm actually quite content with the security of a paid off house ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:07:26
Depends on how you use it. If you use it for day to day transactions then with you personally, if for cold storage then tucked away. But security wise its safe either way.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:19:04
yes please sell so my next buy is even lower!
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:12:01
Yeah that number alone seems so sketchy. Exactly 100 too, right..

It's OK, it just shows you are dedicated to crypto and think that way. It's much harder to get stock people to understand crypto than the other way around lol
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:40:46
Do it on your pc, just don't send your coin to addresses on the full node - pretend it doesn't exist and use the ledger as normal.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:01:56
Coinbase has the coin, not you. Some trust them some don't. Coinbase could lock your account and you can't do anything about it. There are lots of posts of people claiming that happened, who knows if true or fake.

@_date: 2017-11-13 00:19:30
Yup which means returning the schedule back to normal would process at the normal rate which would bring the fees back to normal. Kinda like when Uber has that spike and then a couple more drivers go there and the spike goes down because they have the normal balance again.

@_date: 2017-11-01 21:48:50
The danger in keeping it on your PC, there are many viruses that scan for the wallet file. Having a hardware wallet means it's very difficult to get hacked. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:05:16
I did the same. The hardest part was using the coinbase app, it makes you scan after putting the amount so I had to find a way to copy the address to phone only to find out it let me scan on step 2.
I prefer Coinomi as you scan and hit send and are done but I wanted to use the btc that was in coinbase.

@_date: 2017-11-24 12:40:45
The incentive is the same. Layer 2 would have their own fees. There is no sense in causing disruption now because there might be a solution later. When the solution later occurs you can return blocksize lower.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:38:17
Stripe will accept BTC but deposit cash into your bank. Coinbase will accept BTC and deposit BTC in your Coinbase account.

I did this back when BTC was $200.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:39:31
I agree. When we could mine with CPU or even those mini USB devices then you'd have tons of people mining vs a small amount of super miners.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:28:40
yeah that's what I was trying to explain lol
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:49:02
Hmmm 
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:40:03
I talked to a day trader and he said the price per coin was too high to get into. He likes to trade on 1,000 shares. I tried to explain you didn't need full coins but he seemed skeptical about it.

Yeah you can make jewelry and electronics with gold, but with bitcoin nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:43:10
I personally have coinbase doing a weekly buy regardless. I know how much I can afford to lose, and despite their fee being a bit higher than I like, it's automatic. So I'm hoping this will last longer than a week lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:35:00
well a lot of people are trying to move out of Coinbase so maybe they needed some 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:41:41
The more normal fee is $4/5. So the prices are higher than normal, but much higher than back in the day where fees were supposed to be 10c.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:55:55
maybe he lied. now hackers will be trying the wrong password length.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:30:51

so you're saying we should sell our houses for the 325k cash instead?
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:07:41
I totally agree. The argument against increasing blocksize ends up with charts and what ifs for 100x the transactions. Well sure its a short term solution but that doesnt mean you don't also work on a long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:11:59
they don't get it. some people get hung up on the technology but when it clicks they will realize they missed out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:45:07
So an interesting thought I had..  With the fees being so crazy high, that means the fees miners earn during this period will be crazy high. It's kinda like Uber with pricing, the incentive goes up so more miners are likely to spin up so transactions will speed up, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:55:54
I thought someone posted that it was taking longer than 10 minutes because of the drop in miners?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:50:43
can confirm. ours just has personal momentos in it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:55:56

@_date: 2017-10-25 21:00:20
I'd love to use it in business but it still feels wild west. If I accept BTC for a payment the value changes rapidly and the delay for processing means it won't work for direct sales. Our customers want instant delivery.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:19:21
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:32:55
the thing with bitpay.. its not necessary. many people are using bitcoin for value holding not purchases. the people purchasing know how to purchase without bitpay.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:32:08
So does this mean Paypal is gonna attempt to process Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:23:09
Its the customer support that kills it. We tried accepting btc but our customers kept saying they didnt know how to put their credit card through bitcoin checkout...

Wouldn't a fork before the attack mean transactions after that fork are reversed? In other words if you bought BTC, then BTC forks before the attack, you no longer have BTC but paid cash for it already.

I literally created an account in the last week and it was easier than Paypal.

I am following and posting in both. Been out of the bitcoin realm for a while. I lost my paper cold storage and was bitter for a while over it lol but it is shocking how crazy some in each crowd is over the other side.

Sounds like the classic covering your butt. They want to remain in business and had to make a decision but if they decide wrong they risk alienating the winning group. If they made no call then people would be even more worried, most people were saying to move out of coinbase before the fork because they wouldn't split it, so they needed to mitigate a mass exodus.
Without a governing body it puts every company in a tight spot, so the NYA sounds like a foolish attempt to create a body to do so. Hopefully this was a once off and a more open method is used in the future.

I have a 3TB drive I'm not using, so just setup a node. Still sad that I forgot to backup my old wallet. Out of anger I refused to use bitcoin again, but seeing the growth since then I've gotten interested again.

Exactly. The only thing stopping me is the regulation.
