The community  Seriously people. You come across as really hostile to anyone that isn't a mentally imbalanced evangelist. The fiery "end-of-the-world is nigh and the Fed must burn" look is ... not a good look. I really get that all of this is very exciting, but, seriously ...
The community  If someone shows any doubt because of anything. Or there is any "bad news". Or any criticism. It is valid, or it isn't. Fine. Got it. But please consider that you don't have to go into full defense of the ideology posture. Some of the complaints/worries/concerns are actually valid, and will need to be addressed through software/protocol/market/client-app/acceptance improvements before the chasm to mass-adoption is crossed.
The community  I get that it is exciting when a Congressman buys a bitcoin. Or that O.com accepts it. Or when the Federal Reserve people say that it is interesting and don't blow it off. But the fanfare, cheering and blowing things out of proportion based on their real-world impact reeks of ... desperation. Again: Not a good look.

In a competitive marketplace (which payments are), there are huge costs. Marketing, R&amp;D, operations, risk, running the association for the members, herding the bag of cats those members represent. Globally. For example, Sakura bank of Japan and FirstUSA have different business strategies. Getting them to agree on *anything* is hard. And if that agreement doesn't happen, it's on Visa. This shit is hard because of the raw number of participants globally.

I'm not sure that no information or vague is the same as bogus (which, to me, implies lies with or without fraudulent intent). It certainly tracks with a lot of hedge funds from the point-of-view of vague or non-disclosive. The family-money part seems ... amateurish. 


Have they declared an intention to solicit LPs? That would be ... weird. And, if from here, probably a securities violation. Declaring that one has a fund isn't the same thing as soliciting investors. I would give it a 'wait-and-see'.
W.R.T. Cashing out bitcoin, couldn't they just dump it on an exchange? At least that is legal and won't get them in trouble with the SEC.


I haven't seen them solicit investors (maybe you have -- if so, I'd love a pointer). I'm not sure how a cash-withdrawal would work for an LP. Usually there are usually pretty significant limitations on an LP doing a "claw-back" -- and there are almost always provisions for the GP to side-pocket an investment. A hedge fund is not a DDA or an investment account.


That's depressing. Again, I would be very interested in any pointers to an offer to become an LP in their fund. I might do it just to get a copy of the SEC registration and FINRA documentation.


Don't know. Certainly sounds dismal, if true.

I think that CNN just dumped him because of poor ratings, not because of being under investigation. But I don't know how these things work.
I think that one of his underlings through him/herself under the bus by claiming guilty recently. I'm sure that's tied in somehow.
I haven't seen the wolves go after Murdoch on anything yet, but because he is a distant out-of-touch "owner" of so many media properties, he can probably have plausible deniability.

It depends on what you call a credit card in the evolution of these things. The first "charge card" (in the US), which was what became Diner's Card did not have any loss insurance. BankAmericard, which became Visa had this at the core as the association model was being designed. 
A larger amount of the user and merchant fees than you expect simply go towards making sure that the system doesn't fail in the face of loss, fraud, non-payment and that some people are charge-back whores. Even if they don't get their money back from the merchant ... it eats up a *lot* of support time.

Visa didn't used to allow that according to their card/brand acceptance agreement pushed to/through merchant acquirers. Merchants ate it (the fee). In some places (grocery at one point in history), the fee was still marginally preferable to the cost of paying someone to wait for someone to write a check -- and the hassles of collecting if the check was bad. And, of course, handling cash is expensive with all the in-counts, out-counts, deposits, reconciliation and 30-90 seconds of fumbling per transaction.

Well, you can look at it like this: QE devalues the value of the dollar. So, when a nominal $1 becomes worth $0.80, then something that used to cost $1, now costs $1.25. So, it appears that the cost of goods is going up, when in fact the value of a dollar is decreasing. In any case, either phenomena is displayed by the "price" denominated in dollar-units.

Arguably, yes. But there are a *lot* of trips to China to have to check out everything about a factory when one outsources. 
Sometimes, simply being able to accept a wire from someone in Germany via Deutscheban is sometimes pretty handy. Because of the "web-of-trust" that the banks have set up between themselves and because each bank knows *their* client.
I know that Bitcoin goes away from this, and in many cases that's a good thing. But the traditional system works pretty well for some legacy applications.

Thank you. The POS terminal communication goes to/through an ISO to an acquiring processor and then either onto a credit card network (Like VisaNet for routing to an issuing processor) or a debit network (with PIN) to a program manager like STAR.
In both of these cases, the merchant pays the fee. It's a different fee schedule though because of many things, but one of those being the risk of a PIN-Less transaction. There are velocity limits and the like ... all of which lead to debit fees to the merchant being cheaper than credit fees to the merchant.
So, clearly they prefer debit (although, the recent consumer protection legislation in the US has had an adverse affect on some of this. And Walmart).
A contactless EMV (RFID) or an NFC have an embedded PIN protocol, so they are going to be a lot closer to debit fees (over time, in the US).
Since NFC can and will be cheaper than a PIN-less credit transaction, and since the merchants (in the US) are up-terminalizing, I don't see the financial dis-incentive that you describe. In the US market.
That said, both merchants and consumers in the US become very attached to their current method of doing ... everything ... so it is not clear that people will adopt NFC nor that something new like iBeacon couldn't take off. QR codes seem to have slipped into the quick-sand though, and SMS two-factor methods are too slow/clumsy.
EDIT: Just because you pay a fee to withdraw money from an ATM doesn't imply that you are paying the merchant POS debit card processing fee.

Well the dollar-reserve/petro-dollar/settlement method really is independent of SWIFT. Your talking about Bretton-Woods stuff, I guess.
Nicaraguan trade in Nic-units with dudes in (say) Nigeria in Nigeria-units ... do normalize and settle through NYC with a dollar carrier. Kind of like Ripple or the newer Stellar. And then there was the firm-up with the Nixonian OPEC thingie.
Why do you blame this on SWIFT? They're not even in the US.
As soon as Bitcoin can handle a no-volatility counter-party annual trade like ... say ... $1T, it's be ready for the big time.
It won't get there, but ... for fun, say it does.
How do you reconstruct every other financial instrument used by bond markets, letter of credit, receivable factoring, credit-line, shorts, brackets, insurance ... on bitcoin?
I am sure that it can be done. If some things were fixed. But it wouldn't be bitcoin. Maybe bitcoin 2.0 ... something with sidechains or etherium?
I am a fan of bitcoin. I really am. But I don't think it serves the community to be excited solving problems that it doesn't solve. It makes us (the community) look like ... we're irrational.

Yes. It's an amount there is an obligation to pay. When you get into abandonment, it turns into unearned income (and state-by-state regulations about what time-periods are involved for the card purchaser, the issuer and the corporation). Then the IRS starts looking at you funny. And auditing the books becomes more difficult (expensive). It's better/easier to be able to pay it to the "owner" (cardholder). Some are just turning the entire bucket over to the IRS so they don't have to deal with it after some (5-or-so) years. 


Many of the pure single-load ones have a monthly fee ($1 or so), so it just runs out over time. The reloadable ones have this too, but if you (say) used to get your payroll deposited at a Walmart card (say) and have $5000 there -- this takes a while. After the card expires, Walmart will issue you a new one and mail it to you. Most of the reloadables (like Netspend) do this as well.

Do you think that this is true of the entire crowd? In politics there is the theory of a useful-idiot. An example would be the labor-union (this is not union hate here, people, just an economic/political example) having union wages indexed to being some multiple of minimum wage. They get their congress-critter on board to propose a a change, and get it into and out of committee. But to pass the entire congress, all the congress-critters have to believe that there is popular support. So, there are some nice rhetorical speeches given, everybody knows (now) that Wal-mart is unfair, we need a living wage ... and ... populist ferver and outrage. The key here is: a friggin' lot of voters create the wave. Not even knowing that they are being used. Or that raising the minimum wage may increase unemployment in the very demographic that they are trying to help.
The point of this example (accurate or not, it was exemplary) is that a few people may have evil intentions, but the masses are ... well, the masses. They don't have a plan. They're just "true believers".

Most of the fees go to the store hosting/selling the card or reload points (Greendot, Netspend) -- this is the grocery store, gas station, Radio-shack, whatever. If you don't pay the retail outlet, they don't rack your cards. So ... that's a thing.
The issuing bank also gets some of this fee. At nearly zero percent interest rates, that isn't much of a motivator by itself. They also get a percentage of the merchant fee which is split between the ISO, the acquirering processor, the acquiring bank, the brand (Visa, MC), the issuing processor and the issuer. It starts to get pretty thin.
It *used* to be (before debit) that 1% of the 3% would go to the issuing bank for giving the card-holder ~20days interest free. As interest rates go to zero, the grace period is priced lower ... and you do see merchant fees creep towards 2% partially because of this.
The forgotten currency on the cards is a huge pain in the ass. Home Depot (for example) did about $1B/year in gift cards. Some &gt;10% was "abandoned", which sounds like a good thing (free money, right?), but it is an outstanding liability on the books and in public-company (or any company) accounting terms ... that starts to weigh on you. American Airlines had this with about 1T unclaimed (and unexpiring!) Frequent Flyer points a few years back. Aaand -- the IRS starts licking their chops at what they see as piles of money sitting around in virtual coin jars.
So ... yes -- this system *mostly* works for everyone without the buyer paying to refill the card, except the retailer who has to sell the refill "cartridge". Who deserves (and demands) to be paid.

This is very close to what we were trying to do with the GTO (Global Trust Organization) in the 90s. There was also "split" RSA key-pair that was the "root" CA (like Verisign), that any 7 of 9 founding member banks had to sign to register anydown-stream bank to participate. There was then a global ledger for things like straight-through (STP) currency-conversion and payment for things like letter-of-credit. 
The ability to do sub-second transactions is key for a lot of this stuff, esp. FX and currency option settlement. Settlement risk goes up (a lot) for non-near-instantaneous transactions.

To start with, there is no criticism intended by this comment. This is honestly intended feedback.
This will sound critical, but, what you have written sounds like a combo-attack of mission-creep, overloading the donkey and ad-hocracy run wild. Too many goals/objectives for one thing.
I would argue that you need three organizations:
  - An Apache-style Core-Library, Stack and Application organization
  - An IETF or W3C standards  (and interop-certification?) organization
  - An EFF-style legal and lobbying organization
Different missions. Different org structures. Different incentives. Different participation partners. Different participation models.
Heck, IETF drafts still get hashed out over (and pretty effectively, as does the Linux kernel) by good-old-fashion e-mail lists.
It may be cool to have some sort of open-democracy forum or something or other platform for some of this, but to get up and going and effective while all of that is hammered out, you could do worse than considering the above three structures as they have more-or-less stood the test-of-time and no one is calling the organizations evil, nor claiming that they are ineffective on their respective missions.
I really like your (OP) goals/missions/objectives/values expressed explicitly and implicitly here, but I worry that the perfect can become the enemy of the good ... and that there is a lot of good that can be done with tools that we already have at our disposal. A number of good and effective models to borrow from. 
Are they perfect? Certainly not. Can we modify them later? Almost certainly. Are they good enough to use to get some progress/traction now? I personally believe that they are.
Just a thought -- and I certainly would welcome feedback or a counter-response.
After all of the wailing and gnashing of teeth going about here over the Brock Pierce stuff last week, I was thinking of setting one or more of these up myself ... but looking at the intersection of my prior obligations, I realized I wouldn't be able to dedicate the time required at this time. So, that's my bad there.

Geoffrey Moore wrote a book called "Crossing the Chasm". 
There is a technology adoption curve, and put simply, half of the people are later than average adopters. Half are earlier than average adopters. That's not strange; it's just math.
The interesting feature with his model was the big "gap" on the early-tech having to jump a "no man's land" before being picked up by the mainstream market. Even the early adopters.
Which is to say the very very early adopters are tech enthusiasts, maybe, but for the mainstream to pick it up, the concerns of the mainstream must be addressed. And, not in techno-babble or with crazy conspiracy eyes rolling around while you rant about the fed and fiat and what not.

Stuff money in your mattress, and it will be devalued. So, it's a tough world. Bitcoin makes P2P and micro-transactions possible. So, that's good. The related volatility and (soon) regulatory risk makes it hard for a large scale merchant (like Amazon) be able to accept. 
So, there are hurdles to overcome.

I guess you could look at it that way. A lot of "real world fraud" comes from the human friction of ... humans. Things like people buying clothes at the Gap and wearing them twice and returning it for a refund. There are merchant-side things ("in store credit") and their bank things and your bank things and association (Brand, like visa) things ... but covering all the bases is probably more complicated than an insured wallet.
Net-net: It's more complicated than losing a wallet or having your wallet hacked. And retailers and the payment brands have trained consumers to expected be "serviced" (whatever that means). Thus ... the "ecosystem" over there in card-payment land, the total solution vs just the money-transfer aspects, is important for us to be able to ever cross the chasm. 
It will (hopefully) be done. But it will take time. Mistakes will be made. But just using bitcoin to buy a video game vs. using a card to buy a video game is a nice apples-to-oranges comparison that only works when everything works as it is supposed to. "For everything else: there's Mastercard." At least, that's how the normal human will see it.

Should Nancy Pelosi be held to the same standards as Martha Stewart? Maybe -- but not relevant to your point, though.
2) Why don't the individual traders go to other exchanges not suffering real or imagined or faked DDOS attacks? As simply a matter of liquidity and funds availability, would people go to a robust exchange, rather than hope for a fake DDOS to recede? If this happened more than once, wouldn't everyone bail anyway? Is this a real long-term systemic problem?

You are right- there could very well be something amiss. Also there may not be something amiss. We don't know.
The absence of data is not proof of malfeasance.
But it certainly is suspiciousness-raising, isn't it?
(above, ITT) stated that the US would do well vis-a-vis China because China has 10,000 tons of gold and little in the way of bitcoins, while the US has no gold and 150K of BTC. Assuming that all of this BTC was consolidated into a single account, and assuming that it traded at $1000, $150M isn't even enough to buy an image hosting site.
It was a ridiculous statement on its face, regardless of the amount that Ft. Knox has in it's possession -- even *if* it were to be zero.

Don't know. I can't see that it would hurt them as all of their competitors would have to follow the same rules, so there would be no differential advantage gained or lost.
It would lead to increased unemployment among the most vulnerable of potential employee-types and increased prices at the till, which disproportionately hit the poor ... so it would be a bad policy ... bon't I don't see that Walmart would care one way or another. At the very least, it would close the wage gap they have with CostCo. They may well even be for it at some level.


In what way? They're already a big importer under WTO rules. Are you talking about that PanAm-Asia NAFTA type deal that folks are working on?


Don't know. I think that a robust jobs environment would help America and it's people, but I don't see how that is Walmart's individual corporate responsibility. That starts wandering into tragedy-of-the-commons territory. Any fix here will need to be a blanket policy deal, not simply dealing with Walmart and its "crimes".


Not a conservative. Try again.


Uuuh. OK?


Sure, in some rural areas, certainly this is true. It's hard to deny, these are data driven claims that are true or false regardless of my naivity.
They don't seem to respond to these collections of regional monopoly position by raising their prices on the most disadvantaged among us. You don't really see rich people shopping at Walmart. That ought to tell you something about the good that they do for the poor.
Or ... not.

Having grown up on a farm (Ranch) before credit card associations were even a big thing (and certainly no Visa branded ATM/Debit cards -- but we had our Amoco gas station cards, yessiree bob) ... this is fallacious. As a teenager 75 miles from my high-school, I had gas-station cards, department store cards, Visa cards and a checking account. And no "job".
Now things are even better -- reload-able pre-paid debit cards (Walmart, Netspend, GreenDot) are great. Also Capital One has a number of starter-kits and reboot-kits that are essentially checking accounts with bumpers attached and ... you get a card.

When as many people carry bitcoin as Visa, Mastercard, American Express or cash ... they probably will. 
Oh, and confirmation times probably need to be a little more constant and/or speedy.
Brave new world! Or it will be. Slowly. 
From the time Diner's club was started (1950 or so), until Visa got started under that name by Dee Hock, was about 25 years. It takes a while for some of these things to bubble out into the world.
And for a while there was a gas-station card (maybe still are) ... lots and lots of proprietary charge cards. All over the place.
Bit coin is likely to go through this phase ... fragment and splinter before it all gets rolled up in one-true-single-thing (or standards to support a small set of types of things). This will take time. BTC as a currency may not survive the evolution of the block-chain applications.

I see the hurdles being regulatory, not technical. Even when the SEC shut down the Iowa Market, which was not a proxy for the gaming industry, it seemed that somebody had an axe to grind.
I know you can discretize continuous markets and a lot of standard derivatives contracts do this. What I like to do is look for situations where the underlying assumptions of black-sholes do not apply, which means you can place tiny bets on large movements that you can tell will almost certainly occur and clean up because the options are "mis-priced" by the "market" which is just a whole bunch of people using that equation (or a variation thereof) to use computers to come to the wrong conclusion. 
Even simple things like watching twitter blow up in Egypt after Tunisia, you could tell that within a week or two the price of the government bonds of Egypt would explode. They did. If you can predict a local uprise that will affect local bonds before the "market" figures it out, you are in the money! :-)
I like your insurance one, but the person who takes the other side of the bet is a counter-party. I'm still not sure how you support the claim that you are eliminating counter-party risk in a set of transactions. I'll re-read your paper. It may turn out that you and I are defining "counter-party risk" differently.
Anyway: Lots of good stuff to think about. Thanks for making this more broadly available/known.

I guess that this simple fact is what irritates me about the request mill. Doing this stuff is hard work.

"It's a cool idea bro. Go do it. I hope you enjoy the fruits of your own labor, because no one will pay you for it!" is kind of how I feel like responding.

Given that the docs are open and the code is open ... I think that everyone who has a great idea should avail themselves of the learning opportunity that they have. The opportunity to learn how to program, honed by developing your own app. It's a wonderful time to be alive, and very liberating.

This is the traditional role of prediction markets. Pretty fascinating at predicting "group" consensus with a group of people not just being polled. They were a self-selecting group that entered a poll because they were confident enough to put their money where their mouth was. For binary events, such as Romney vs. Obama's election, they were pretty good .... but really hovered around 45c/55c for a long time (out of a $1 pay-out). then rapidly shifted about a week or so before the election.
The government didn't know how to deal with them, so both the gaming (gambling) regulatory folks and the SEC ganged up and shut down prediction markets (esp. InTrade) in the US.
How do you think they will treat bitcoin? If it's money, your violating securities law (if not set up correctly). If it's not money (poker chips), you are violating gaming laws. And of course, the IRS doesn't care: they just want 40% of your winnings. Which is pretty crazy. You bet $0.60 for a $1.00 payout. And they take $0.40. No return. How do you see getting around this?


I'm not sure this works. Heritability of IQ isn't something that the lay-person knows enough about to place a bet. CAGW, GMO, (vaccines), people "think" they know enough ... but really they have bubble-think opinions. And any market would have to be placed around a binary event. Such a specific statement being proved factual or counter-factual within a time-frame. So, "Global Average Temperatures as measured by satellite, and not urban "hot-spots", will go up 3decC by 2025." Or something. That is a bet I would take if someone wanted to bet on it. I'm not sure how to structure this with GMOs.


This is "nice". But you get into he-said/she-said spin on interpretation of what the word "is" is, and what the facts are. You can see this with Avik Roy and Ezra Klein being selective in the facts they elect to present and how they package the facts to make their respective cases. Neither are objectively wrong, but they are playing red-team/blue-team and when you are debating policy, how do you see what's right/wrong? Some said that Obamacare(for example) was bad policy and it should die. Other's said that Republicans were lying/scare-mongering. Then the exchange nonsense happened. Republicans are like "See? We said it would fail" (they did). Democrats are like: "But you got the failure mode wrong" (they did). What would you do about this type of thing?


Interesting. How?


I don't see many policy makers looking to prediction markets to sway their decisions soon. But how would you structure to be binary in a time frame? How do you un-entangle multiple causes that aggregate to a final effect?


Interesting. How?


Uh. Sure. Securities stuff. Not prediction markets. Unless you see Black-sholes pricing models as predictors with their outputs in expected price to place a bet on a market event. "I bet $1 that this $1B will be worth $10B in 5 years."


Back to the regulation question. Do it off shore? I'm actually working with a group to build an off-short (floating) global bitcoin lottery thing that plays every 24 hours. 


Interesting. Still not prediction markets. But how? Also, I don't see the no counter-party risk part unless there is a big backer like AIG or a secondary market like Marsh-Mac, or a big-ass escrow account. Or a bond-type thing. Which ... has a counter-party.
Anyway: I like your enthusiasm. I like the applications you are pondering. I can not but help think (and yes, I've read your paper) that you haven't thought through the hurdles of implementation. Or are you simply looking at this as a theoretical economic game-theory model framework?

What do you mean? Opening a bitcoin paper wallet within the view of an attendees video camera at the funeral?
EDIT: Stupid question, but -- paper wallets aren't hard to make; there are libraries and the like out there. Why don't you make a wallet like this yourself?

In addition, a lot of Western Union's traffic is (for example) moving undocumented worker's paychecks to their families in (for example) Mexico. So, we're looking at &gt;$1000 average transaction size. 
Opposed to that, we have people "tip-bot"ing 0.0001 BTC all over the place, so ... that's another measure.
I think that WU makes about $20 (on average) per transaction. So, that's a thing.

Thank you. I'm apparently communication-challenged enough that I usually end up offending people unintentionally.


That would be the apache.org model.


That would be the EFF model.


I have no problem with a 'mystical DAO' effort. I just also like the pragmatic approach to "take care of business" while the DAO thing is being designed and constructed.

Stockpiles in all of the 34 IEA members usually hovers around 2.5 billion barrels. Global demand is around 85~90M barrels/day. So ... if all production halted, about a month's worth. I don't think that the stockpiles would support that as a long-term strategy. And they don't need to -- they can already kick everyone's ass at $30/barrel.

I wish that I could apologize, and say something about being drunk when I wrote that. I wasn't. Just grumpy, I guess.
So, first, in terms of hours worked. You are correct. Most journalist I know work almost as long or more as young-ish attorneys, wall street bankers and silicon valley engineers. My comment was unfair. I apologize.
Added into that mix ... dead-line pressure makes the task double-tough.
In terms of of having to be a generalist that covers different beats, often with short tenures, leads to one not being able to develop deep expertise in a field. And to that degree, you make a fair point. I apologize.
The quote thing still pisses me off, but ... that may be tied to the word-limit thing. I guess I would like to be able to comment on the article before being published to help correct any "errors", but that's probably tied to the dead-line thing.
Anyway: I'm sorry.

It's too slow to play fast-trading games, so that's disappointing.
Right now, if I'm not a speculator/investor/miner, then to use it for payment I have to buy coins with a card. It's easier to just use the card for me.
But, it's fun to watch!
And I like the idea floating around with color-coins and that financial instruments are computer programs. The systemic exposure to meltdown would have been know if there was a central book regarding all the distributed CDO contracts. That's really cool.

I think that posting the current one (up to date) on Git-hub (for example) is not required. What is required is that a copy of the source code is made available upon request. Which could simply mean sending a CD-ROM when asked. Certainly, this is how the GPL used to be interpreted before high-speed broadband and free source-code hosting was a thing.
Is this now "wrong"?

Because the front-end guy and the back-end guy don't talk enough?


That's true. Probably somebody had a brain fart about stupid users accidentally deleting accounts and being mad about thatl.


I don't know what federal regs would apply, but I'm going to guess that they probably need to keep records for a long time like a bank does. Wells-fargo for example moved deleted account data to a completely different set of servers to comply with that.

What is the benefit to the buyer-seller transaction to use bitcoin, when in the case that you outlined, both already have card and/or DDA accounts?
Isn't that making an extra (harder-to-use, +risk, +cost) step for the purpose of ... what?

Well, the Manhattan financial elite aren't Visa or Mastercard or DFIs ... so, they don't make fees associated with moving money around.
A lot of hedge-funds are *individually* bigger than the entire bit-coin universe. Heck, even John Paulson has personally made more from leveraged trades (positions, bets) than the size of the entire bit-coin universe.
I would guess that they think that bit-coin is cute and maybe interesting, but not really a threat. Nothing that bit-coin does threatens the way they make money. And if bit-coin (as a currency, say) grows, then it is just another thing to arbitrage against other things. Another market.
So, again, I ask: why would you assume that this group to be anti-bitcoin. 
(Hint: They as a group are not anti-bitcoin. The question is about the assumption here that they are or would be.)


Ha! Not really... I have no binoculars that peer into the minds of redditors.

Ummm. MasterCard which came after BankAmericaCard (Visa) are associations of banks. That have rules via which they contract and interact. And networks connecting banks. And there are (of course) "processors" ... IT groups that host "auth" apps on behalf of credit-issuing organization.
PayPal is a SVA (Stored Value Account) system ... a G/L of all the little paypalee's account balance on a G/L, which is exposed. ALL of the paypal subscriber's money is "prepaid" into a scrooge mcduck size pool of money with a thousand little ledger monkeys keeping track of what money belongs to who and under what conditions it can/will be released. And how.
"Trusted Third Party" sounds like Verisign-speak. CA stuff. Credit card rules and the ecosystem *do* decompose into regular building blocks, but just because there is a logo on a piece of plastic, don't assume that is what it *is*.

The interesting parasitic game that they (the elite) have been able to construct is that they don't care "which" money wins. Or which asset wins. They just do the equivalent of buying low and selling high. And, sure, why not pocket a million or two that way if you are personally so inclined. At this point, it won't make a difference (win or lose) in their personal lifestyle, and won't change their game.
One example of the buy-low-sell-high thing is Egypt. I think before the whole 'blow-up' (demonstrations) government bonds were selling at like 5 points. Twitter blew up in the early stages of the demonstrations. I called a friend and we chatted about it and I convinced him that demonstration would break out Tunisia-style. He bought the bonds. Demonstrations broke out. Risk went up. Price went up. 10x. Got out. 10 days from the first twitter-flurry. That kind of thing.
