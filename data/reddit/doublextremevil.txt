BIP 101 doesn't advocate sudden jumps, but rather a smooth increase. Every block the max block size is a bit bigger than the last, so in 2 years it is twice what it was 2 years ago.

the main user facing difference is that blockchain download speed is much faster. Also, if you don't have ubuntu, then you have to go to  then you have to download the latest version of the bitcoin program (this is because there is no auto-update system part of the bitcoin program)

not very valuable, im guessing. Bitcoin really depends on a functioning global network to be useful. Within a small local network, i could see it being somewhat useful, but currencies in general will take a back seat to barter.

Stigma? I think bitcoin can handle a legal local gun shop. There will always be bad press about bitcoin, but that doesn't mean we should shy away from expanding the bitcoin market place.

This hack appears more interesting than the previous ones... either way, bitcoin is providing a very darwinian environment for businesses. 
In the short term, theres going to be a lot of hacking going on. However, longterm, we will have some pretty resilient systems in place, more resilient than the current fiat ones... perhaps

well, as the black market gets up to speed with Bitcoin, i think it will be used in that respect for sure. Keep in mind, its only been in the spotlight for less than 2 months, and businesses take time to establish themselves.

Well, it does only have worth as long as people believe it has worth, and that is quite similar to the major state fiat currencies of the world, but because it is acknowledged by no law or state, BTC can technically be considered fiat and not be considered fiat.  IMO, as it is such a new phenomenon, it deserves a new term.

speculators are weary, but i believe it wont matter in the long run.  the longer it stays at this price or lower, the easier it is for newbies to buy their first or second bitcoin, which is better for bitcoin as a system than as a get rich quick scheme.

Yes, it is quite possible for a government to launch a successful attack at bitcoin, but it would cost millions of dollars as many Super computers are not really optimized for bitcoin mining.  Also, with all that computational power, it would be much more profitable to keep the network alive and just sell the coins.

Bitcoins are scarce (never more than 21 million) and part of a semi-anonymous system where people can get things they normally couldn't.  I see them being used in a grand internet black market that is difficult to stop.

Nobody has to listen to the devs, and if they didn't there would be a fork in the blockchain, bitcoin .7 and .8 would go their separate ways. However, this would cause a lot of turmoil and the price would likely drop precipitously. It is in everyone's economic interest to maintain the unity of the blockchain. 
@_date: 2013-02-22 13:03:52
Thanks for the source. If their conclusions are indeed true, then Bitcoin could be a bit more deflationary than initially thought. However, it is impossible to distinguish between coins mined then hoarded and destroyed coins.

Sorry, i should have been more specific. Here's an article that seems to be what you're looking for 
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:02:37
you are assuming that the coins are bought at an exchange, and not in person with cash. You are also assuming that the evil entity has not properly anonymized their coins using tumbling services and online wallets that obscure the original source. 
Assuming that people do find out the address of the evil entity and block it (i dont know if this is technically possible, but lets assume it is), it would be trivial to switch to a new address, making it an ever lasting game of cat and mouse.
