Exactly, if there is cash which you dont need to ıse it urgently throw into btc. Especially if your age is young (20s). Limited supply eventually make it more and more valuable

You can think as a long term investment in bitcoin. Like 5 years.(or more) even i was earning by trading btc last year , i relaized that i would earn so much more if i just hold btc.
Think 5 years ago you were doing this.... 
In 2014 june 1 btc is  nearly 750 $ now it is 11400 its a very very very good return rate...

Where we can see the accurate rates? Or is it fixed to a certain number?

Maybe because some of the transactions can not bee seen in the core ?
For example someone transfered a bitcoin 5 years ago and he is holding it in the same wallet since then. If we shortened the core blockchain his transfer will be missing? (I am not sure just thinking)

I am 40 years old and it is difficult for me to  understand all the aspects,I am not a trader but in my opinion bitcoin is one of the biggest gifts for the human kind so i want to support it by opening a bitcoin core node. 
Just one more question:
 when volunteers open  nodes, does this means that the btc transation fees will decrease? 
What i mean by that ; miners take a fee for aproving a transaction, but a volenteer who runs a btc blockchain full node  help to aprove a transaction but  dont take a fee. Am i right?

Bitcoin has a very big potential, and i think it can go up that price. But before that it needs a push like some new properties (like lightning network for everyone, more WORKİNG ATMs, peer to peer fiat exchange exchanges that have more anonymous about the users, more full nodes, more web pages, educating our children about it, less miner centralization, more shops accepting it) . Until we start to do these things it will drop...

If lightning network used in peer to peer transactions this  may lead bitcoin to accept as a payment method.
