The only things my bcash was good for was shifting it to BTC and LTC
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:37:35
I will never not laugh at this.

I would not be as enthusiastic about bitcoin if I hadn’t heard him on the joe Rogan experience or found his YouTube channel or read his book The Internet of Money. Fuck those shit talking shills on r/BTC, Andreas is a great man and will go down in bitcoin history as one of its biggest if not THE biggest advocate for bitcoin. I will always support him and hope he never stops educating those ignorant of cryptocurrencies.

I’m giving it on paper wallets this year, if they can’t handle a laminated piece of paper they don’t deserve it.

Been holding for a straight year. It was rough the first few months but you learn the be patient and trust that it will rise. Good things come to those who wait!

I think we can go lower, im saying 3k range before we have any real growth, personally I hope we hit 3k so I can buy the fire sale.

What about encouraging exposure of exchanges that support SegWit instead of boycotting those that don’t? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:31:19
This is why I don't like exchanges. I don't want my bank to be breathing down my neck when they see what I'm doing with my own money and try to step in a swing their fiat dick in my face.

A smart investor doesn’t put all their eggs in one basket. It doesn’t hurt to diversify, just do the research and make sure the coin(s) you choose is gonna go somewhere and not shit the bed a week after the ICO.

Blockchain.info does a lot of good. Don't knock them just because they support a shitecoin. It's a phase, one lightening becomes commonplace bcash support will fade fast.

@_date: 2017-12-11 15:50:33
You're right it is a big deal. Remember though, there are ways around this issue, you could switch banks but who's to say that another bank wouldn't do the same thing? This is why I stick to using ATM's or LocalBitcoins. You might have to pay a premium or go through the rigmarole of meeting a stranger in person but that's the price you pay (no pun intended) to make sure you're bank doesn't get on your ass about your own money. Think before you buy and buy smart!

Because to China bitcoin is a sleeping dragon they are about to wake up 
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:52:13
depends on how much you have to put in and how patient you're willing to be for it to hit a certain price.

Lol I have a Gold/Silver price chart app that does something similar, whenever I open it and ad pops up that say "GOLD IS DOOMED!"

Not entirely true, while a miner will always generate a certain amount of noise, newer models are A LOT more quiet than the one they put out 2-3 years ago. Example: Antminer R4

mainly whats keeping people from buying it is their lack of understanding about how it works in the first place.

I have a feeling we'll get a few more gains before our next big correction but who knows!! To the moon brothers! 
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:47:16
Don't feel bad, we've all made blunders with out crypto, it's all part of the learning process. Just don't let history repeat itself 
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:00:37
Good, that means it'll be even better once it goes to 2000+ and all these nay-sayers will be kicking themselves to death that they didnt listen to us.

10k in a few years? Try a few months! Get yourself some BTC or other cryptos ASAP! Good on you for seeing the trend beginning before everyone else! BUT DONT SPEND MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE!
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:57:15
Holding means just that, holding your bitcoin and not selling it regardless of the price. The longer you hold and wait the more it will be worth.
@_date: 2017-01-15 23:09:53
Gotta figure out if the risk is worth it, I wish I bought more at $200, look where we are now. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:12:16
buy and hold whenever
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:33:53
Just remember to manage expectations accordingly. Personally I feel we'll be over 10k by early next year with current trends but 20k+ won't be far off. Good luck my moon brothers! 
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:03:29
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:05:47
Oh this dither is such a tease 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:45:14
Considering how much it's gone up in the last 8 months I don't see why we couldn't reach 10k before the end of the year, we'll hit a few bumps along the way but those are just more buying opportunities! 
@_date: 2017-01-15 14:41:56
Just stay on target, you'll do fine 
@_date: 2017-01-12 18:42:29
i like bits
@_date: 2017-01-15 14:45:03
Well it already has crashed this year, twice technically. This is just the nature of the beast we are dealing with. As bitcoin increases in value and usage it's guaranteed to keep crashing but as more people use it the crashes will be covered and recover very quickly 
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:29:03
Future Benchmarks to look for: $888 again, $1000 again, $1080 again and finally $1448 and beyond
@_date: 2017-01-15 23:07:27
I won't argue with that about the Chinese. They could but I don't think they will. They've been buying too much bitcoin to do such a thing. But yes this is all cyclical, watch the price and charts and buy when you can. We've recovered from the most recent crash and have hit another stride, we will either continue to rise gently or we'll crash again...which will just be another buying opportunity

My first correction was the longest in recoded history after the first big jump over 1100, those were exciting time but we didn't know HOW long it would take to correct

I cant wait till he comes back after another three years, BTC will be over 100,000 and he'll still be saying its never gonna happen.

I don't see crashes, i see buying opportunities
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:27:40
You know you don't own that bitcoin as long as it sits on an exchange right? Move it off and take the hit for the transaction fee and move it to cold storage or a blockchain wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:54:48
40k by May

well you aren't american if you aren't thinking about that every day
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:57:05
If you want to buy I don’t advise exchanges, get yourself a mobile or offline wallet and buy from an ATM, do a google search for bitcoin ATM there’s new one being installed ever day in major commercial areas

Depends who you ask, people who got in during the december rush think its doing poorly. People who have been in for the last year or so know that if you ignore the FUD and just hold your coins it'll go back up in no time.
@_date: 2019-01-09 17:52:28
At least they admit it, but will they reverse their policy? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:13:35
Trump? lol no he cant do anything, but yes after awhile it will correct again before going up even more.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:35:53
Oh Trey please make this happen 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:04:55
Every correction is a test of strength. The longer you hold the stronger you become. How strong are your hands?
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:09:21
I dumped my bcash into LTC
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:19:38
I don't give in to FUD, I'm just along for the ride and picking up more people as we keep moving 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:50:17
At 10k, or now. Doesn't really matter 
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:14:47

Forks are no threat, at least not in my eyes. There was a meme on here yesterday that called them fun coupons, cant think of a better way to describe them. Bitcoin is solid IMO but there is no reason why I couldn't be wrong. That's why I diversified into other crypto's to hedge my bets. Some may go well beyond the price of BTC but I believe BTC will be the universal store of wealth.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:59:19
We've been on the cusp of mainstream all year with these gains, its put so many more eyes on BTC is the best way possible. We'll get there, waiting is the hardest part.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:27:01
Take those fun coupons and put them back into BTC or divest into alts!!!
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:25:22
Well done
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:08:48
Been doing this since December, its gets easier. If I've learned anything this year its patience.
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:01:25
Just you wait, we've barely touched the 1% mark of people around the world even knowing what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:12:13
pullback is healthy, we'll be back at 10k in no time! This is how it should have happened back in Dec instead of running up to 20k

I'll admit bcash is a legit crypto and not a shitcoin if Roger streams himself inserting his head up his own butt
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:32:46
I agree (as a long hauler) this is a non-event but its still fun seeing new all time highs. As an avid price watcher I knew we'd hit this point but it still makes me giddy. I have however learned to keep my excitement contained for the most part. I'm sure we'll get a nice correction soon and moved back up in no time.
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:59:16
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:43:14
How exactly? Have you ever used LTC or compared it to a BTC transaction? It’s way faster and fees are cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:25:32
What’s scammy about taking the BTC source code and making it faster and cheaper to use?

@_date: 2017-06-27 12:58:54
yup, that's how I feel talking to people about BTC
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:33:02
I think one of the reasons he hasn't talked about it, aside from BitConnect, is because he knows how impactful it would be if he actually did put his support behind BTC or any crypto really.
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:09:27
I wish you good fortune in the upwards swings to come.
