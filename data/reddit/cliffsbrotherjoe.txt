Newbie question. I’ve done a lot of reading/watching and know enough to be stupid. Made my first purchase via an exchange. So I watched a video of someone showing how to transfer money from an exchange to a wallet. He showed both his exchange address and his wallet address in the video. One I was amazed at how fast the transaction happened. I know that’s how bitcoin works but it was cool to see. My question is security. He showed both his addresses in the video. Are they secure because of a pass phrase? I got a bit confused seeing him nonchalantly copying his addresses on the screen. Can someone point me to something to read more on how the wallet addresses work or give me and ELIA5?  Thanks

Thank you. Still on the fence and may fund an account and wait a bit. Like everyone, I wish I had considered this a long time ago, but I also wish I would have bought amazon stock 5 years ago.

Another question. I plan on starting small with recurring bitcoin purchases. I’d obviously like to limit fees as much as possible so I buy more bitcoin each month. I also value security as much as that is possible. I understand that none of the exchanges are fully secure. I plan to eventually get a wallet, but just starting, what is the best place for consistent monthly purchases? Both Gemini and Coinbase seem fine but the fees are higher. Cash app says it’s “free” but I’ve read about not getting the best BTC price when purchasing which is essentially a fee. Just getting started I am more comfortable with one of the more established market places. I’m sure there or more onscure options that I may consider down the line. Any advice on the above 3 or another way to make monthly contributions is appreciated.

Thanks. I’m in US and looking at Gemini and Coinbase. I’ll take a look at cash.

I’m sure the opinion on this varies and I apologize if this isn’t the place to ask, but which is the better investment vehicle in your opinion, bitcoin cash or bitcoin?  I’m debating even diving in for the first time and if I do it will be long term. I have no interest in trading. I have read a lot, but am still bit confused on the differences between the two. I plan to start small (if at all) so I guess my question is more, do you think it’s better to own more bitcoin cash since the price is lower or pieces of bitcoin for the long term. 
Again, I apologize if this isn’t the right place to ask, but I appreciate any opinions.

I did it!!!  Wire came in, account verified, small initial purchase made, setting up continued deposits and purchases. Wish I would have done it sooner but so does everyone else. Thanks to everyone who answered my stupid questions, I’m sure I’ll have more when I’m rich and start worrying about where to transfer and keep my giant stash. Thanks again.

If I go in, this is exactly my plan. Regular monthly or every other month purchases. Thank you for the replies.

What exchange do you use to make your consistent purchases? Thanks

Thank you. Is there a link or something so I can learn about Satoshis? Never been tipped before. Thank you
