At that point, you'd probably want a refund back. If they wont allow a refund, hit the gym and lawyer up.

They use your money to fund mining for themselves and put your card in their mining 'cloud'. Once the card is useless and they have got your $2700 and made 100% profit while mining on your card, they blow it out with an air compressor and send it to you. 
They get away with it by telling you it'll be shipped 1-3 months after ordering.
It's unethical.

I agree with most of what he said. The community is very toxic and it shouldn't be like that. 
I used to do a lot in altcoins and some stuff in Bitcoin. I was pretty much a slave of the owners of Bittrex. I was never not nice to people and had only helped people in all directions, but I got in heated discussions over altcoins and Bitcoin, which lead to people doxing me, threatening me, and knocking my VPS offline for weeks at a time with major ddos attacks. Simply because I talked bad about a coin and it's features. I was scammed more times than I can count, and I saw people being scammed more times than I can count. The money gets to peoples heads and it's very hard to actually find good open minded people who wont want to get back on you.
Who wants to take part in that? Not me. I became afraid to participate. I dumped all of my altcoins, dumped most of my Bitcoin (I think I have .004 left), and wont be coming back.
Anyone here that doesn't agree that Bitcoin has failed at it's current point, is saving their asses and trying to not lose money by putting up a facade of a good community and good fully fuctional currency.

This is how all cryptocurrency has been. Optimists.
Realists get the downvote.

And then lose your ass. Good luck.

No miners are switching to XT. You can fire up 20,000 amazon servers with the Bitcoin-XT client and never change a thing. Bitcoin-XT won't happen.

Manipulated up by Mt. Gox bots. It would never be this expensive if it wasn't manipulated.

Except, you know, the laws being made by states that some Bitcoin exchanges are having trouble with.
By the way, the Dollar has been getting stronger while bitcoin has been getting weaker.

What the fuck? Is this the Paycoin/Gawminers subreddit?
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:03:03
I keep seeing this everywhere. Miners aren't switching to XT. You can fire up 20,000 AWS severs with the XT client and change absolutely nothing.
It's not gonna happen.

There have been 3 pulled out of where I live. When I was in NYC it wasn't so hard to find a ATM. I even bought a little bit while I was there

8MB isn't XT being mined. 
BIP101 is the one XT block mined by Slush's pool for the 25BTC bounty which made the price crash.
Still looking at around 0% support for XT from the miners.

Only 80,000? Wow. That's not a lot especially when there's also a lot of automation going on there. Really shows the proportion of people NOT using Bitcoin.

Why do people in Bitcoin and altcoins just throw thousands and thousands of dollars at people they have no clue who they are? I'm glad you learned something.
iGotSpots is a long time scammer.

One block. You've certainly convinced me!
Nice ad hominem attack.

A quarter of a bitcoin?

So generous. This is something for if they haven't picked it up already.

Bitstamp and now Bter are losing profits and operating costs are too high with the price at $150-$250, so they're taking out millions to fund the company or fund someone's pocket by creating diversions like "some hacker stole this much". 
It quite possibly could also be the company that took over Bitstamps wallet (after the Bitstamp hack) to get more business and more $$.

Whenever I see stuff like this in here it just screams "I smear altcoins so Bitcoin looks better, so I keep making money". I personally want the best to be at the top, whether it's Bitcoin or another Altcoin. I also think Bitcoin moves fairly slowly in development where altcoins are developing new algos, different wallets, much higher security, and anonymity. The _only_ reason Bitcoin is ahead of some altcoins is because of it's value and huge mining network.

Of course, when you hold that much bitcoin, and run a large bitcoin exchange, you're going to say negative things about competitors and hype up what you sell.
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:39:41
If I've learned anything about Bitcoin exchanges, its that a lot of them have piss poor security and should be audited security wise inside and out.
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:27:50
I'm not affiliated with this, but have you ever seen altcoins like  ? These altcoins make Bitcoin look like a fischer price currency.
Bitcoin was something to improve upon.

This is complete and utter BS by a dev who has never contributed anything to QRK. He said this exact post a few days ago in a behind the scenes project member/dev post on qrk.cc. He is forking a new coin. He is in it for the money, big cash, a job, popularity and followings. He has stated it himself above. He apparently asked for complete control over the core source and got denied access by Max. He was demoted from his position this morning as Moderator on qrk.cc.
Max and Kolin are still around and posting on qrk.cc, and bitcointalk. (
Quark is doing well among distribution:
I imagine his twitter followers SKYROCKETED after this post.
I am a project member for qrk.cc. I'm not giving any additional details into other workings and talks of quark, I just wanted to say that these are the guys truly bringing development and productivity of quark down, the guys truly spreading about the scamcoin terminology.
