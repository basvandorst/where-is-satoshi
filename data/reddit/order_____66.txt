Where were you when the price was &lt;$100 :D
@_date: 2019-07-16 10:46:03
I spent an amount of bitcoin on it in 2013 that would’ve been worth about $2M in 2017.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:59:13
Time to sell!
@_date: 2019-07-16 00:20:35
My $2M Subaru STi sure was fun!!1!
*regret intensifies
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:08:49
It was a 2014 GR STi hatch, also got the motor rebuilt with forged internals and a big turbo. Was making almost 500whp.
Sold it last year because I got bored with it haha.
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:41:46
I drove it for 5 years and it was too fast for the street. It also requires oil changes every 2K miles, new spark plugs every 10K miles and it went through other consumables  at 3x the rate of a stock STi.
It was horrible at autocross because of the massive turbo, road courses wouldn’t clear it and I had to be careful at the drag strip since it wasn’t caged and it was fast enough that they required it to be caged.
So basically all I could do with it was drive fast on the highway. I’m going the opposite direction now and getting a Toyota 86, it’s not powerful at all but it will allow me to autocross, drive road courses and have a lot more fun!

Same here bro, keep moving forward!

This is why getting married and subsequently whipped is stupid, that little wife of his wouldn’t be all negative Nancy if he’d bought pre-2017.
She’d probably be more likely to divorce him if he had gotten rich though :D

$1000 Bitcoin could happen sooner than most investors think 
@_date: 2019-03-22 03:26:35
No, I just like burning money
@_date: 2019-03-11 04:31:03
You underestimate the money hungry-ness of a gold digger.

My life insurance policy will pay for cryopreservation of my head, I’ll hopefully be able to pay for full body with BTC.

What a dumbass.
@_date: 2019-11-27 13:59:41
All of those Lamborghini Mercy’s are at least 9 years old now as the Mercy was only built until 2010. Any idiot with an average job in tech could afford an average condition used one of they wanted (although that would be a horrible financial choice). Don’t meet your idols.
@_date: 2019-03-31 11:41:51
Buy more!
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:43:18
I'd probably check at least a few hundred times with that amount of money.
@_date: 2019-03-11 04:41:10
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:44:37
Why, if someone is moving that amount around I'm sure they've sold enough to live 10 extravagant lifetimes carefree.

Don't worry guys, I just needed some cash to buy 300 Ferrari's to complete my collection.
@_date: 2018-10-17 00:12:41
Trust me I’m in the same boat!
@_date: 2019-08-04 10:56:52

1. Don't give a fuck about your neighbors car, have a massive portfolio/net worth and drive a cheap car that you like.
@_date: 2019-02-08 02:10:03
I’ll do it for 0.25

Keep in mind that when women say they are single they are on a 5+ guy/girl rotation and just haven’t found anyone worth cuffing yet.

Another thing that reminds me of vegans is that bitcoiners always tell you when they first started buying ��. 
I’ve seen this since I got in in 2013, all the 2012 buyers were bragging...
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:29:55
I think it’s a carpet, at least I hope it is 
@_date: 2019-04-30 03:47:41
I have old Facebook chats complaining about only making 0.25 BTC a day from Amy rig.

As a financial advisör I also recommend this, take out a high interest loan from me!
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:36:49
This time we are getting at least a 40
@_date: 2019-12-07 14:04:49
Here ��, you look thirsty.
@_date: 2019-04-06 12:30:33
Yeah, I also stack gold and silver and I almost had a heart attack at first. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:34:37
This has been a good month for me, made 40% shorting SNAP and 25% on my crypto :)
My index funds and bonds are also up about 3% since 3/22 when I bought back in and my gold/silver has jumped a little bit recently due to recession signals. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:38:24
Haha, now the dudes she rejected are rich and she’s a broke bitch. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 10:52:52
Now you get to trade in all the rest when she divorces you ��
@_date: 2019-04-27 12:10:22
Wow, I’m shocked that tether is insolvent /s

@_date: 2019-04-03 12:28:19
Jeff should do that to keep his money safe form his soon to be ex
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:39:58
It’ll be somewhere between $1 and $2.2M
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:33:42
I do expect a small pullback, still hasn’t stopped me from buying though!

I would literally give an arm, a leg and an eyeball to go back to June 2010 and invest just $1K in Bitcoin.

2 words that would've changed my life had I read them back then.

Shit, you weren’t supposed to see that yet, looks like my time machine distorted your reality and caused a timeline merge. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 23:23:23
$10B could probably get you almost any city you want in the entire world.
@_date: 2018-11-13 01:53:33
I wouldn't make that mistake, again.
@_date: 2019-01-10 04:54:07

@_date: 2018-11-19 22:16:43
It’ll go back to $20K, when a loaf of bread costs $100.
@_date: 2019-05-04 03:35:57
Googled it thrice
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:01:32
$8495 now
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:13:34
I’m not, I’ve made a lot of money in the last day.
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:00:40
Of course.
@_date: 2019-05-02 03:08:02
As a gold and silver (and BTC) collector this made me laugh!
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:01:44
J/k made you look
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:32:48
I sold in December, buying back in at a 90% discount now ;)
