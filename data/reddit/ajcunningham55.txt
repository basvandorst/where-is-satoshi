Isn't the difficulty adjustment the determining factor here?

Trump you made it
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:57:31
The network will fall apart with fees and unconfirmed transaction under the weight of the large number of bitcoin transactions if there aren't sufficient miners to secure the network  
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:33:25
God damn I hate the phrases FUD FOMO and HODL
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:02:48
Wow how closely does Google search data correlate with the price?
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:23:17
Do you mean proof of concept?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:44:57
Also a drop of 50% requires a gain of 100% to recover
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:02:02
Sooooooooo close but yet so far
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:51:24
Burning the circuits at both ends I know that game
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:18:52
Let's be honest bitcoin is gold at this point and there is no way to send gold to someone you will be paying much more and waiting a lot longer
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:03:19
It's the rumor about China beginning to phase out bitcoin mining operations 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:49:33
0 is always possible
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:41:31
Already dropped 1000 since this 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:07:57
Yeah but let's take it up with coin base the government can stay away entirely 
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:32:57
Yeah from the guy who thought theranos had good governance. Tim Draper is an idiot. Bitcoin is amazing technology.
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:20:38
Now that's what I call stupid
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:15:53
Yeah it's a little scarier that US debt is 100% of GDP
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:48:36
Why is  r/Bitcoin  so similar to  r/wallstreetbets  now? 
It kinda sucks hearing the same bullshit
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:53:47
Everything about these forks is concerning and sad to see
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:56:01
Also these TX fees are brutal
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:39:25
That makes sense
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:23:31
crying jordan if you actually did it
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:31:49
Great perspective but why would someone then pay large amounts of money for AWS nodes?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:07:49
Bitcoin won't "lose" it will be replaced in that scenario. It would happen quickly and as quietly as possible, not without my deep disappointment. Exchanges and wallets could simply change BTC to something else and BCH to BTC. Newcomers wouldn't know the difference and the price would continue to rise.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:41:05
Very good point 
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:18:10
Speculation is so much fun
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:24:46
Praise Satoshi it's great to see an update like this. Long awaited.
@_date: 2018-03-07 05:28:40
This is why most investing is open only to accredited investors 
@_date: 2018-03-07 05:27:20
Rolled out to accredited investors first and retail investors after further evaluation by coinbase (not to mention the SEC)
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:56:06
ING probably those hundreds of millions in BTC purchases. Or bitfinex took out a loan to get ready to back up tether.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:51:17
Yeah says the guy who waits to invest in Apple until they're nearly a trillion dollar comany
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:47:57
And this isn't some dotcom bullshit company with no revenue. This is a platform for capital appreciation like gold. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:02:27
Or up before 10/30
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:48:53
I think Bitcoin is still a poor currency 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:11:27
Now some Chinese Bitcoin enthusiasts probably becoming Monero enthusiasts
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:58:48
It's not a perfect system as you can see the price is now near the bottom of my predicted buy range of 3750 to 3900. But always stick to a strategy if it's worked consistently in the past.
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:21:49
A low price? Alot of theses guys probably got 1000x their original buys. Pairing those gains now before things get complicated is worth taking the profit. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:09:47
If only there wasn't China harvesting those trees faster than the average Joe can keep up with
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:51:54
That's what I'm worried about that some dickhead in Congress will single out Bitcoin for this bullshit at the behest of the bank lobby
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:21:23
That's true but price moves in Bitcoin don't always follow the average investors sentiment in my opinion. Although Bitcoin has moved similarly to US large cap tech companies just with higher volatility.
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:12:05
Terrible decision. There is absolutely no way it's going much lower than $3700 and even that might not be in reach 
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:11:19
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:05:53
Buying the dip once it "bottoms out"
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:59:12
But they can buy Bitcoin with CNY right now if that stops less people will have access to the better parts of the market
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:59:05
If I'm on Coinbase how do I get my Bitcoin cash that I can exchange for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:53:37
I really don't think Bitcoin can be subject to technical patterns like other assets. This may fall back to 3000 before relaunch. It's very difficult to determine what will, at any given time, move the price significantly in either direction.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:24:43
I respect him as an analyst. I was just having fun with how it must of felt doing that spot where the price was at the moment
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:43:40
3900 here is the level I'm watching everything below that is worth buying. Just look at the 6 month chart in detail and then look at when negative headlines moved the price lower. Those negative moves have been ~25% declines from the previous highs. The last previous high was ~$5000 so a logical next launch point is between $3750 and $3900. Trust the math, patterns, forces at work to make you profit.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:19:17
Debt clock gonna be smoking
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:01:35
Chinese government red tape readjustment is the main mover for now I expect that to continue until there is concrete legislation from their government. The 20% retracement number is an estimation based on past performance to reduce downside risk when making a purchase. 
This is a price flux/volume model that has worked similarly with the NASDAQ and Bitcoin for the last year and a half
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:50:29
Dead cat bounce or trampoline bounce?
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:45:06
Bitcoin definitely goes sub $4000. I'll probably bite at $3950 but will increase purchases if the price drops more than that. The absolute lowest it drops short term could be around $3750 but that will be a short lived trench.
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:43:11
Chinese selling for CNY before exchanges close in the next month and a half
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:59:37
Still a downtrend forming just wait until you see $3900 this is where the most is made
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:34:42
Negligible long term, but it is something that probably moves the market lower in the short term;  by how much is anyone's guess
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:20:51
If all exchanges must close by September 30 I'm guessing they will cash out before that's impossible
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:41:00
The exchanges haven't even closed yet 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:06:15
Yeah I'm eating my words and just coming to grips with the fact that once you think you know the Bitcoin market you're far from it
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:31:11
Wow thanks for the info
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:56:24
Yes just like you own USD you should have some BTC
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:09:25
I would love the Bitcoin moon shirt size medium black

What is BT1?
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:00:55
Oh fuck 
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:34:49
What is FUD?
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:06:29
He's about to retire with millions upon millions I don't think he's pissing his pants
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:11:27
Now some Chinese Bitcoin enthusiasts probably becoming Monero enthusiasts
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:41:08
This guy seemed nervous
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:12:54
Can't thank you enough man seriously I appreciate your time
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:18:01
China making Bitcoin less accessable to the largest market is a problem. Likely a short term problem but not insignificant.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:18:00
Slightly smaller drops as more people catch on the blatant attempts at price manipulation
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:13:10
Not yet
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:47:23
He's got a point technically but maybe that should change 
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:15:08
When can someone get the BTG from their Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:16:15
If you live in Switzerland yeah but Bitcoin is international currency. USD is more liquid in America so you should hold some.
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:05:52
True I concede that
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:28:34
Link to context? 
I'm genuinely curious
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:09:18
Not hard right now
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:47:29
Coinomi is my best guess I'd like to hear more suggestions though
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:20:51

Greed knows no bounds
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:35:35
Don't speak to soon it could bounce down hard at 10k and those nuts might get mashed
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:47:57
And this isn't some dotcom bullshit company with no revenue. This is a platform for capital appreciation like gold.

@_date: 2017-09-22 18:50:29
Do you guys not realize that alot of affluent Chinese people are trying to unload Bitcoin before the government forces exchanges to close. This will be a long process, until the end of October, where Chinese sellers pick the prices they want to dump, couple that with the drop in volume from others fully cashed out, and the price will fall until a new catalyst brings back buying volume in other parts of the world.
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:04:57
With Bitcoin and fiscal policy where it is I don't see the dollar going much higher in the next 3 years
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:31:11
Wow thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-07-09 05:10:56
This type of suspicion is why I won't use LN for a long time
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:27:24
What's the big deal?
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:50:31
Yeah I asked them and haven't heard anything back from them yet
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:00:28
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:46:43
Exactly, but volitility is higher now so the move could possibly be more dramatic in the next few days or even a week. I have no doubt in a year BTC will be substantially more valuable than today but I'm 100% positive that there will be some large bumps along the way. 
Don't sell buy strategically.
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:37:50
I'll buy it

At the time it was his stated position that he would wind down Americas conflicts globally. He didn't end up doing that fully but he did wind down involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. I know someone is going to bring up drone strikes and I don't disagree, but the nobel prize was given during a time when we were given every indication that Americas global wars would slow down.

Intrinsic value in its simplest most general meaning is found in an object with value in and of itself. It doesn't need to be more complicated than that. Food has value as food, gold has value as gold, and so on with many goods.
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:19:18
There are different definitions of intrinsic value
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:52:17
Shut the fuck up about it that's how you keep it going
@_date: 2017-10-01 06:28:07
Why don't they give people their rightful fucking 2x and let them decide what to do with it?
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:14:44
Week and change ago if I recall correctly
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:16:36
One example. To calculate the intrinsic value of a stock using the discounted cash flow method, you will have to do the following:
Take the free cash flow of year X and multiply it with the expected growth rate
Then calculate the NPV of these cash flows by dividing it by the discount rate
Project the cash flows 10 years into the future and repeat steps 1 and 2 for all these years
Add up all the NPV's of the free cash flows
Multiply the 10th year with 12 to get the sell off value*
Add up the values from steps 4, 5, and Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents to arrive at the intrinsic value for the entire company
Simply divide this number with the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the intrinsic value per share.
I know there is no correlation to crypto in this case, but I do think some people have been able to attach an intrinsic value to the decentralization of a crypto network
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:06:54
Why sorry for people on exchanges?
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:14:22
I thought BT2 was Bitcoin gold and B2X would be the November fork
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:06:05
Bitfinex for sure is giving B2X
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:37:30
Thanks that's what I thought. What are some things to look out for when it comes to replay attacks and scams?
@_date: 2018-07-08 04:11:34
Economic value would be an example of an objects extrinsic value 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:06:15
Yeah I'm eating my words and just coming to grips with the fact that once you think you know the Bitcoin market you're far from it
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:31:20
I'm not trolling I'm just not convinced of the security of LN
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:14:42
He had the balls to do what he did I can respect that.
That being said he does come off smug.
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:27:04
Wasn't that bad 
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:20:36
Explain because I was under the impression that many things have intrinsic value.
