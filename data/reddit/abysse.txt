I would have thought your number was way off though. Do you have a source for that visa / mastercard number. Because if you take a big wallmart, you have already X transactions per minute. There are more than 1970 supermarkets in the world :)

That's the point :) BTC is today too complicated for a currency. BTC is to computer what Amrstrad was with DOS and programs on a zillion zip disks just to load a bar tender game...

Sorry but it isn't possible. You can't have consistently investments that exceed or match a loan rate. Otherwise, you would contract infinite loans to make profit so you need infinite money -&gt; bubble perfect recipie :)
Also, if you have a paycheck u need a budget, if u budgetise, choose the appropriate housing, watch your expenses ( insurances, energy bills and every compulsive purchase) you can in most cases afford a restaurant every now and then. Spending to feel rich is the best way to be poor.
My answer may feel harsh but im on ipad, tired and i don't judge people by their net worth.

I agree with your points and i posted a couple of questions about it. 
With a deflationist economy and perpetual one, you go back to the basics. You will buy out of needs rather than out of will. So every purchase is bad deal considering that the next day it cost you less. Is it that bad? On the human elevation side it sounds better than our current over consumerism but indeed it would be a slower economy. I like the simplistic grasp i have of that theory.
Also in you example you took an appreciative asset like a house, but what about current depreciative assets in our current economy. You buy a car, turn the key and you just lost a shit ton as well. You bought a car not because of inflation but because of a need. So slower economy but still existing. 
From my very limited undertstanding of the economy, currently not on only we create unlimited wealth but we also speculate on the bright future with the governement depts always increasing. It works just like a martingale in a casino. You know your future will grow so you can always borrow more for as long as there is a tomorrow. Like you know your black or red will eventually hit as long as you stick to the same and there is a tomorrow, by doubling your bet every time. You will eventually get profits. All it takes is couple of consecutive systemic bad hits to wipe you out and erode trust in the future. 2008 was the blatant example. Before 2008 a western country going bankrupt out of loans wasn't possible. You didn't hear about these quotations agencies before. Then 2008 striked and we started to question the whole. In france we still pay the high price for that through a tight governement budget trying to reduce the dept weigh and us paying god knows how many taxes.
Now for the bitcoins side. It carries a fake promise. Banks are going no where! They would only go out of a dramatic chaos. To banks and authority, at the moment we are just little kids toying around in a confined play ground. It is a zero sum game so whether it is crypto or goods we spend the money, they don't give a darn about it as long as you pay taxes. Money will eventually hit bank accounts anyhow.
Now if we are going to this world in a marketing point of view bitcoin is the more likely to succeed because it came out first but it has many challenges to overcome and so far it is prevailing over them quite poorly.
Note my thought is still being constructed and I read everyday to know more so it can totally be inconsistent and i won't be offended if you think wisely differently, but it would take sources to make me evolve rather than empty rethoric reasoning.

Bch carries something different than block size. From my basic understanding, you couldn't buy your bread daily with solely greater block size but it is a good temporary scaling solution.

You mean $20k ?

This is exactly this. An identity crisis. 
But i will reduce the impact by saying, it is the proper order of things. I mean, internet was meant for military to communicate, it turn out into something else. Then, a guy said it is a directory. Google came in as we know. Then another dude says it is more than just a directory it connects people and tadaa facebook kicked in. 
We have a new tech we know it will rule the world as we know but so far it struggles to find its place until a brillant mind rock our world.
Same story goes for pretty much any invention out there. Oh i find power in my lab, did this Volta thought it would turn out this way? nope. 
Same goes for cellphone, same goes for computer, TV you name it.

As bitcoins hits mainstream it will more likely stabilize the whole. 
Since there will be more trading activity, there will be a lot more orders at a static price.
Futures will allow more conventional traders to go in by leveraging their losses betting on futures.
Now the question, is what's going to happen before, because we haven't had a support period for a long time. 
Support gives a referral price to the market to define whether it is a good value or not. 
Referral prices changes of course but they are required for the market to be healthy. 
Now when the prices raise that hard I can see only 2 reasons. 
Either there is a high speculative period on an asset or an item perceived value changed dramatically due to its context. 
If anything 200k transactions are unconfirmed and 70 millions worth of BTC are being stolen and may hit the exchanges. 
Sorry for that pessimistic short term view, my mouth is where my money is  so I cashed out and placed it onto BCH, turned out to be good for now and according to what happen I may even USD Thether for the first time :)
I expect the bears to come and according to the latest charts they are knocking at the door. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:23:54
Imo the bad news until we know what we have, the transition won't be necessarily pretty. Being reactive will be required. For now BTC is going no where and it will take time.

We can use the same meme while watching you :D 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:47:16
Mine is that bitcoin will need to find support first. I mean at the current time it just makes no sense. 
3 months ago people were happy to buy at $3000 and now people are happy to buy at $15000. Economically speaking it doesn't make sense. 
Long term is another story but short term bitcoins is in deadly need of a price.

Hmmm oil doesn’t fall in this category. Production is being manipulated to maintain a high price and tell that to someone who lived the 60s. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:26:21
when people says it is a bubble all the time which by definition makes it a no bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:46:06
Not a BCash fan what so ever, but i do think that the btc fees are an issue which is eroding my trust of reacting fast in front of an issue. The fees are unsustainable atm. I'm saying this as a retailer accepting btc. Bcash isn't the solution thats for sure lol.
Now what's happening is a bit shady and could be related to a wide shill for another bcash takeover attempt. Current Market's movement doesn't make sense to me

Will be adding a couple beginning of next year. If the the home based one isnt too grady network wise, i'd scale to more
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:28:13
It really can't be translated like that. I mean really. 
It is all a matter of collective perception and perception isn't correlated to market cap. 
Interesting article though
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:31:05
You do ? Because personally i'm not sure what's happening right now either :)
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:19:47
You are right, but on our sides of things being an evangelist is pretty much everything we can do. 
That being something big is being cooked with out dear chef Trump. A potential bad outcome for the dollars may occur. Check the todays newspaper with Russia being ultra bearish on the US dept positions they had. China may taje the same path. That is the window the bitcoin will be exploding and dont even need to be a drastic collapse for it to happen. Bitcoin is here and will stay, not if but when the btc come back it will be on way more solid roots / value

I clearly know what I'm talking about giving the amount of successful DMCA 'like' complains I receive per year that do get domains suspended.... but won't get into a troll war to make a point, either take it or leave it...

Both MasterUm and yours answers are saying the same. 
Both of your answers are fantastic, thank you. 
Now, for the starving part to spend, there are far more ramifications than just the simple problem or starving or not. 
For the bottom needs of the Maslow Pyramid, okay sure. You have truly no choice but to purchase no matter the value for your basic needs / housing / security. 
Now, for the more questionable needs. Latest cellphone, latest 8K TV, buying every iteration of a product and so fourth, I do see a problem. 
Such economy would totally slow down the progress. On the bright side people would be wealthier and more wary to spend. But I lack of economical knowledge to assert whether it is a good thing or a bad thing.

Today's movements was just about seeing the guy to cut his right balls as he said he would :)

My question was more about the BTC economy itself. 
In FIAT, the inflation is a healthy factor, if controlled and actually important. 
BTC is the opposite by nature since you can't print more. And, I do exclude forks which is rather different as well and mess with the simple scenario pointed in my question.

DMCA like request issued by layer sent to the domain registrar stating obvious misleading / copyright information. Domain will be suspended. I'm on the front of such system abuses ;)

A lot cheaper and a lot better.
