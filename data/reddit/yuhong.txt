Though the basic telemetry level don't allow MS to read arbitrary files, so the bitcoins would be safe:

@_date: 2018-08-08 06:18:14
Obviously, but it is still interesting to think about.

Yea, search suggestions aren't really anything new. I think Ubuntu once did it too. I think all of them allow it to be disabled if you don't like it.

It would be fun if the graphs was compared with Bitcoin prices.
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:28:59
I do these submissions because people often pay off debt using Bitcoin here.
@_date: 2018-08-09 05:01:50
I now believe the entire debt based economy is the problem, not just "banksters".
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:55:16
There is a reason why I posted the stories about paying off debt here.
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:17:40
Yea, I mentioned the issue of paying off debt with Bitcoin.

It would be much better to have the extension mine say primecoin instead.
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:23:55
I think there already is primecoin.

And to be honest yes this attack is possible without Tor. Tor just makes it easier. It is also easy to prevent, with the infamous lock icon all browsers had since the beginning of SSL.

This reminds me of what if hundreds of billions of debt was paid off with Bitcoin though.

Keep in mind I think David Marcus was specifically hired to fix PayPal by eBay.
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:49:12
I think they finally will split up next year.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:48:16
I think David Marcus came directly from Zong, I think, and he was trying to fix PayPal.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:38:52
This is the same state that just had the coal-related incident that contaminated the water supply.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:30:36
No, miners are still allowed as far as I know.
@_date: 2014-08-02 05:46:13
In fact, one possible ASIC idea would be to do identical prefix SHA1 collisions.
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:46:46
I submitted this link to Reddit for a reason (notice the response from David Marcus of PayPal):
@_date: 2015-05-18 06:00:03
Really? I mean, the funds were never really lost, just frozen. You eventually will get your money back with PayPal.
@_date: 2014-08-11 23:03:13
Of course, the disadvantage is that you can't spend any of them during a power outage for example.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:54:07
I think this was why David Marcus was hired in the first place.
@_date: 2014-07-31 21:31:30
Notice that it is only domain verified.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:16:35
Yea, I already can imagine people selling bitcoin to pay off debt.
@_date: 2018-06-18 23:48:39
"The $40.3 billion in credit card debt that we repaid in Q1 2018 is 23% above the post-Great Recession average. "
For comparison, the market cap for bitcoin is hundreds of billions I think.

I wonder why not mine Monero on a Rabbit 4000/5000 processor that has AES acceleration. (Start by implementing mining on 8080/Z80)

Their rates are ~5.3 cents per kWh plus demand ($5.5 per kW in commercial areas, $15 per kW in residential starting in April 2020).

Brendan Eich refers to the current economy as "usury". I tend to call it the "debt-based economy".
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:36:41
What would be fun is to pay off debt using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:25:21
I wonder how much debt is paid off each time the price rise.
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:13:06
I notice that it is following the S&amp;P 500 closer now, BTW.
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:04:29
That being said, the profit from mining didn't seem to increase so far, so it might prevent the old GPUs from being sold off instead. That might change though.
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:11:35
Thinking about it, I wonder if the floods might be the reason the hashrate stopped increasing, where it has been increasing fast up until now.
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:02:28
I think commercial rates are generally lower than residential rates anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:46:19
This by definition slows down the increase of national debt. In this case this is a partial shutdown, but a full shutdown due to the debt ceiling is also possible.
@_date: 2019-05-14 03:16:23
One thing fun about bitcoin is how every coin is traceable. For example, paying salaries in bitcoin and showing where it is coming from would be fun. This is very different from how the current economy works.

I think he was brought in specifically by eBay to fix PayPal's problems.
