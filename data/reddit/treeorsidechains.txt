All I see is a lot of "security issues" he raises that never actually happen. Bloom filters for instance never turned out to be an issue dispite months of scare-mongering that they'd DoS the network and people would lie to SPV nodes. Some pretty poor software engineering too, like his fix for the extra data vulnerability that not only didn't work, but opened up a new vulnerability that Gavin Andresen had to fix later. I'll admit some of his ideas sound pretty clever, like the replace-by-fee scorched-earth stuff, but they are still untested and even they are highly controversial at best.
But then again, this *is* a guy who's activities in university apparently involved [putting a watch in a block of resin]( and calling it "art." (?!) I know the valley likes to make a cult of people without degrees, but this isn't apps we're making — the qualifications of the sidechains team are really solid.
I'd really like to believe Peter has come up with something amazing like reddit seems to think. But I'm just not seeing it and your post is doing a better job of convincing me that reddit is being swayed by an angry personality, not code.

Obviously if they are paying him to research treechains they have an intention to deploy them in the future. My investment would be a long-term thing to take advantage of that future.

Thanks for the reply! That's a very insightful position to take on the issue.

Uh-huh. You know the right thing to do would be to give peoples' BTC back right now. I can't imagine 10% of the people who bought Via thought it was going to be a nice cozy donation scheme.

Well he did say it is a 50% time commitment, which I assume is 80 hours a month, or $4k USD at the $50/hour rate he said elsewhere. That would be a lot to spend on a figurehead. But still the point is well-made in general. Or this could just be a temporary pump-n-dump scam. Viacoin did suddenly double in price.
Something I do like about sidechains is lack of dependence on yet another coin. Adam Back is quite right about digital scarcity.

Why is alicebtcmayes [getting censored]( here?
If Todd has a conflict of interest the Bitcoin community deserves to hear about it.

Thank you for the feedback. I agree that "Bitcoin 2.0" is probably overblown, but my investment is meant to hedge the bet that it is not. Treechains looked like it might be the most reputable thing *other* than sidechains in that space given that the rest, Mastercoin and Counterparty etc. are such obvious pump-and-dump scams... or just made by people with no understanding of the field. That said this "embedded consensus" idea that MSC, XCP, colored coins, etc. make use of sounds pretty discredited as well:




Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr also have written a lot of stuff pointing out how it's just spamming the blockchain with garbage. One issue of course is figuring out how to invest in sidechains! Not as easy if you can't just buy a coin.


Yes, so then why does he keep using that term?
edit: Solid reply here 
@_date: 2014-08-01 10:37:31
Exactly, for all we know he'll be fired before he even starts.
@_date: 2014-08-01 10:04:50


So basically you accepted 610 BTC of *investor* money and you don't even think they are going to get a return.
Amazing, just amazing. You're an "honest" scammer, except time machines don't exist. Glad I didn't pre-order.
I gotta say the sidechains team is looking way more reputable right now — they are not making it easy for me to put money in because they aren't ready to take it!
@_date: 2014-08-01 07:22:18
Right, but sounds like it is much, much worse than Bitcoin or sidechains. Not a high bar to be better than "scamcoins" (which I've never invested in, except for some early mistakes)

Convenient that the shit-coin\^H\^H\^H\^H alt-coin paying you is deploying CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and making a big deal out of it while Bitcoin Core devs like Maxwell, Corallo, Wuille, etc. are complaining that you've been holding up the CLTV patch and disrupting the development process to delay it being adopted. You're quite happy to get the free peer review and free advertising though.
No conflict of interest there at all.
Also, anyone wondering if they should invest in Viacoin should know that it's so centralized CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY is being enabled via a hardfork purely on the whim of BTCDrak telling people to upgrade all at once.

You didn't fix CVE-2013-4627 at all and you didn't find it either. [Gavin fixed it.]( All you did was [add vulnerabilities]( to Bitcoin in your rushed attempt at a fix to claim credit.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:08:55
Seems that Peter Todd and Brock Pierce [hang out regularly]( (my contacts tell me this is from a Pierce-funded Vegas party)
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:25:54
Thank you! People forget that altcoins drive down the price of their Bitcoins even in the best of circumstances simply by theoretical economic considerations of supply and demand. In the real world they risk destroying the social consensus that digital scarcity exists and Bitcoin is valuable. In turn this destroys the security of the blockchain and Bitcoin itself. Opposing scamcoins needs to be a priority of every Bitcoiner.

It's just a photo proving he was there. Speculating about the personal sex life of women in the Bitcoin space should be off topic and drives people away from the community.

The Bitcoin Foundation said they'll be hosting developer training and certification workshops now. Peter Todd works for the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium, who was also trying to become a Bitcoin developer certification authority. He might be "concerned" about this for more reason than one.
