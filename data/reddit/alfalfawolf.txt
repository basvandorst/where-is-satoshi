Yes but it only has value because enough people agree that it does. The utility of money is that it is an effective exchange of goods and services. Without the agreed upon value, money is useless. 
Bitcoin is bought and sold on an open market. It’s price reflects its agreed upon value. The big difference is that bitcoin is an upgraded iteration of storing value. It is a deflationary digital protocol backed by mathematics. Money (aka fiat currency) is inflationary and vulnerable to the actions of temporary political leaders and greedy financial institutions (ie. the creation or printing of more money).
If you don’t mind that banks hold our money, leverage it to make untold sums of money and then refuse to share those rewards with the people whose money was leveraged... then keep aggrandizing the same financial institutions that crashed the world economy. Crypto allows people to control their own wealth and to make their own profit off of it.

There are really a lot of things that give bitcoin value. But I think this is a solid response for people who remain skeptical. Because it can be used as a vessel for greed we will see it’s value increase. The gains in crypto are rare in the Wall Street space, when institutional money comes (I think they are here now) they will bring greed with them. Greed will keep bringing us new ATH’s.

Yeah you should never get personal with the people you spend the majority of your time with. Good rule, hard to follow.
EDIT: I’ve talked to people at work about bitcoin and fielded some basic questions and provided coworkers with links to Andreas videos and the most objective articles that I have come across in my own research. I always try to say that they should do their own research and not to gamble with more than they are willing to lose. I also try to warn them that most coins are scams. I’ve warned a few people that bitconnect is a scam and have gotten the cold shoulder. Still, I would feel like shit if they lost money after I introduced them to crypto even with the disclaimers. 
Basically you can lead a horse to water, but what are you supposed to do when they drown themselves instead of just taking a drink?

That it has value in real money is the reason why it is no more a mirage than real money. The market is dictating that people are assigning bitcoin a value relative to real money. 
EDIT: If you want to talk about a real illusion, we can discuss credit cards. Let’s not forget that it took decades for credit cards to be accepted universally. The concept is crazy... Swipe a card to spend the money you don’t have. Yet we accept this as being reasonable.

The concept of money is a mirage! If the world went broke tomorrow many people would suffer and die. Yet we would hold essentially the same amount of resources on the planet.

Krugman enables neoliberalism. There is a lot he doesn’t know about. 
Also, Krugman in the late 90’s said this:

By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's."

I do feel like there is a competitive advantage to trading in the crypto market right now because many experts are still being made. I think that’s one reason that its compared to the Wild West. There is a rare opportunity to recognize a trend and get out in front of it.
I like the crypto market over the stock market because it is more accessible to everybody due to the fractional nature of coins. It doesn’t feel as rigged against small investors just yet. I do see the market manipulation but I think that is negated by the chance of exponential gains, which are pretty rare in the stock market.

Honest question, would you pay off all credit card debt before starting retirement accounts? We still have some lingering cc debt that we’ve consolidated (so the interest is more reasonable) and will pay off in about 18 months. But we also have a mutual fund, a 401k and an IRA. So we have some savings but not very liquid. I think an argument could be made to take money from a retirement account to pay off they debt but we’ve decided against it because the penalties would probably exceed the interest I’d have to pay. I suppose I should stop contributing to those accounts until that debt is paid off. But we have little extra to move there as it is, along with the few thousand we’ve prioritized to stash in crypto.
Once the cc debt is out of the way, then there’s one of our cars and the home. The game never ends, hence the need for more money. The home is a good long term investment that has appreciated for us but I’m not about to take out a second mortgage to pay off debt. The car is just a necessity, although Ramsey would have convinced me to buy used. 
I ask this here because I want the perspective of someone who is willing to invest in crypto but also diligent with personal finances.

You are stuck thinking in binary terms. In no way am I advocating communism. I’m critiquing capitalism which is inherently tied to the fiat money you choose to defend. We can do better than both systems. Capitalism is just an incentive structure with a gamed distribution architecture. Communism is a different architecture that also does relied upon on international market that requires money and the means of production are still essentially controlled by the elite. Communism is a deeply flawed communal concept of an economy. 


That’s not correct. Fractional reserve banking is the creation of new money through debt. The US govt sells bonds to the federal reserve in exchange for new money, then it is deposited into a commercial bank which only has to keep 10% as reserves. The remaining 90% can be loaned out to businesses, people or whatever. The deposit / money creation loan cycle allows for the initial deposit to be multiplied by 9 times it’s original value in new money. This new money steals value from the original money supply by diminishing the purchasing power of any old money through inflation. All fiat money is inherently inflationary. The genesis of all money is debt.


I’m not sure if you could possibly be more naive. What exactly can be purchased that doesn’t filter money to the ownership class? The best way to prevent this from happening is to make every business a cooperative whereby the ownership class is expanded to include more people. Instead, the reality is that even basic essentials are purchased from Amazon, Walmart and Target. These companies have convinced the masses that saving a few dollars is worth losing an broader ownership class. This problem is getting dramatically worse and you’d have to be extremely ignorant not to recognize it.


Cryptocurrencies have the ability to undercut fractional reserve banking by allowing people to hold their own would-be deposits it can halt the ability of banks to create new money in the form of loans. It also has the potential to allow regular people to engage in micro loaning. This would essentially redistribute power away from financial institutions and into the hands of regular people. The deflationary properties of cryptocurrencies can allow for value to be created through network effects. Crypto doesn’t necessarily solve these problems however. Instead of fees going to banks in the form of interest, they go to the miners dedicating resources to resolve transactions. This just creates a new model of wealth extraction.
So why bother with cryptocurrencies? For one, it can potentially hit the reset button on class status which could be beneficial for early adopters in the labor class. And secondly, it’s an admission that our current form of capitalism is broken and that change is necessary. This gets society one step closer to adopting a resource based-economy which could be the inevitable path taken once technology allows for zero-marginal cost. Money is meaningless. Only resources hold actual value. If all the money in the world disappeared tomorrow, we would still have the same amount of resources available to us. Distributing resources in a more egalitarian way requires the dissolution of fiat money.


Me explaining all of this to you should be considered as part of my contribution to civil-society interests.

Bitcoin creates wealth. There is a lot of wealth still to be created. It will be exploited by the already-wealthy and there will be ups and downs but ultimately every bit of wealth possible will be extracted from bitcoin. Early adopters may be able to climb class status in this new Wild West.
Automation is going to take money out of the economy (more profits to to the wealthy money hoarders) and right now Bitcoin’s ability to create a deflationary store of value for USD is the only known counter punch to an inevitable financial disaster.

97% of US currency is already digital. But the problem you speak of is an old one that goes further back than the Great Depression and has led to the creation of the FDIC which ensures that at least a portion of your holdings will always be available. 
Bitcoin cuts into how much fractional reserve banking the banks can do. Banks are allowed to lend 9x what they receive in deposits. As a result, they basically create new money with every loan. They also create new money by charging you interest because that money is not taken from the total supply but added to it. All money is debt, derived from a genesis loan and then multiplied through fractional reserve banking. So if you’re wondering why banks don’t have the cash to cover the holdings of their clients, it’s because they are creating brand new money all the time.

I never claimed that bitcoin could replace fractional reserve banking. I’m saying that it’s existence makes us question money as we know it and that this skepticism could ultimately lead to a drastic change.
Everything else you say is just a defense of a broken system that is designed to benefit the wealthy while placing the rest of us in debt-slavery. Your logic is extremely flawed. McDonalds wasn’t built by one person or even a handful of people. It was built by every employee top to bottom. To achieve profit, labor must be paid less than they contribute. This is inherently exploitative. 
The investor class benefits from a disproportionate amount of profit not because of their hard work but because they already have the money to act as an investor. The risks they take are relatively very safe because a few bad investments won’t result in homelessness and they only need to invest a very small amount of their hoarded wealth to make more money than the average worker. A large percentage of these people have inherited wealth to begin with so they aren’t required to actually work in this system. This is the greatest example of being handed something for nothing. The stock market itself is a Ponzi scheme based entirely on speculation and bag holders and has very little to do with a company’s actual profit distribution among share holders.l
Your suggestion that I just personally hold cash instead of putting it in financial institutions is extremely short-sighted. This puts me at risk to robbery, fire and water damage among other things. It’s also a sure-fire way to lose value of your money to inflation. 
Both inflation and deflation of money are telling signs that money and monetary policy are deeply flawed. My problem with fiat money is that it operates in a ‘free market’’. Again, bitcoin won’t solve this but it opens the door to questioning money as we know it.

@_date: 2018-09-11 21:11:00
Martin Luther King Jr must have been whining when he said that capitalism was built on the foundation of slavery.
In your McDonald’s scenario you assume that the free market is just and self-regulating so that an employee and employer can reach consensus on a fair wage. In reality, the employer has significantly more leverage than the employee because there are generally more applicants than positions available. Therefore he doesn’t have to pay a fair wage relative to the production the employee will create but instead relative to what the person is willing to accept. The more desperate someone is to survive the more likely they are to accept a low wage. I’m not saying crypto will change this but it might accelerate society’s path to change.
The stock market is not a zero sum game. The companies that are invested in do not factor into the buys and sells of investors who cannibalize each other for profits but the companies are able to raise money for expansion through this process. You also should factor in the costs of trading that go straight to financial institutions as payment for the barrier to entry. This means that most people, even millionaires can benefit or be bitten by the ponzi-esque nature of Wall Street. But the financial institutions benefit with wins as well as losses. 
Even when loaning money, financial institutions never really risk anything other than the collateral they offer up which was new money created from a previous deposit. It never really existed in the first place.
Financial institutions are absolutely engaged in a money-making machine. Keep defending the broken system all you want, it doesn’t change the fact that there are many severe flaws to fiat money. Crypto won’t solve everything but it can limit the power of financial institutions and it represents a shift in how money is viewed in general... Which again, can (but won’t necessarily) lead to a complete overhaul of the system in the future.

Cryptocurrencies are actually more accessible to people than stocks. Being able to buy fractional amounts is an improvement on the stock market where stocks can’t be divided. If you’re poor, good luck buying stock in google. Stock ownership is a scam because our entire financial system is a scam. Shareholders should not be absorbing disproportionate amounts of a company’s profit over the workers who supplied the necessary labor. Outstanding debt will always be greater than money in circulation. Our paper money has no real value, arguably less than bitcoin since it is cheaper to mint paper money than it’s value in bitcoin. Bitcoin is supported by mathematic principles at least.
All this to say that everything is a scam. Bitcoin is just the latest iteration of the money scam and an inevitable and far overdue upgrade over paper money. Will it fix capitalism? No, but it will buy it some time. 
EDIT: I do realize this isn’t a convincing argument for buying bitcoin. A more appropriate argument might be that decentralization and lack of trust make this potentially the least scammy money option available to us. Since its price grows with the size of the network, it could be financially beneficial to adopt this tech early.

Markets are irrational and manipulated. The underlying reasons that gave you faith in bitcoin still exist and are relevant.

When this happens, nobody knows but the wheels are in motion. Again, I personally believe that a devalued dollar will bring people to bitcoin because at the end of the day people want the most bang for their buck. My hypothesis is that a market crash will be good for bitcoin.
The stock market is way overvalued at the moment, most of the profits go to the wealthiest 1%, and it truly operates as a Ponzi scheme because the certificate of stock are worthless and only worth what somebody else is willing to pay for it and not necessarily correlated to profit.

As for bitcoins saving the economy. It is possible but probably unlikely. A mass adoption of bitcoin would have the potential to reset the boundaries between rich and poor. It could also create a new class of wealthy. The problem with those who hoard wealth is that they take their savings out of circulation. As the rich get richer, less money is circulating through the economy. If poorer people start making money off of bitcoin you can be assured that they will spend it.

80% of the world lives in poverty. 16% of the US lives in poverty. So I don’t think I’m only focusing on extremes.
Financial institutions have not changed their practices and are still jeopardizing the economy. This is why we shouldn’t enable them any further by allowing them to hold and reinvest our money.
As for stocks, there is no direct connection to a company’s earnings and stock price. It may help but it is not necessary to make money. Tesla is a perfect example of this, their stock price keeps climbing but they are losing money. This is because speculation is the primary driver of stock price. Only stocks that offer dividends have a relationship with earnings, and dividends pay very little per share held.

Rat poison is a currency that allows for quantitative easing as a means of bailing out the banks for crashing the economy. But by rats, I mean the 99% of us who struggle financially. That rat poison is pure debt (all fiat money is actually debt). So money in its current form only produces wealth inequality. Bitcoin can’t completely change wealth distribution but it is the most powerful tool we’ve ever seen to do so. This is because of the network effect that raises its value as more users join in. And because it’s divisible, it’s much easier for poor people to buy. If you want to buy into Berkshire Hathaway you’ll need nearly $300,000 for one share!

Investments in public stocks go up or down based entirely on speculation. The price is driven by the amount of people willing to buy or sell the stock. There is no direct relationship to a company’s profits and the value of their stock unless they offer a dividend. But it’s not easy to get rich on dividends alone because they are usually pretty small per share payments. Currently Facebook, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and Google do not even offer dividends. Despite the fact that Wall Street operates a Greater Fool Scheme, they host a platform for the majority of “good” investments.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies actually serve a function and have inherent utility. Many tokens have been created to pay people for sharing their resources (content and attention for ads, shared computing, internet access to name a few). 
As for Bitcoin, it allows for cheaper and quicker international money transfers while being a more secure protocol than a centralized bank can offer. Hackers are currently stealing about $500 billion every year primarily because of centralized (single point of failure) systems. 
Bitcoin also gives us a way to store our wealth without enabling the greedy and destructive banking industry that makes money off of our deposits, does not share those earnings with us, and buries us in debt by charging near-predatory interest on loans. 
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are revolutionizing the monetary system and changing the way people think about their finances.

Bitcoin eliminates the need for a bank to complete the transaction. Banks create money out of thin air in two ways. First, they can loan out more money than they have on hand. Second, they charge interests on loans. As seen in the housing crisis, banks take unnecessary risks that can put the greater good of society at risk.
The transaction fees in bitcoin go to miners. Mining cryptocurrency has the potential to be a passive income source for users. The more decentralized the mining community, the less likely there will be a corporate monopoly on mining. 
As seen with the latest rejection of Segwit2x, the bitcoin community has the power to reject changes to the code that do not benefit the greater good.
People will be able to control their finances in a way that has never been seen before. The lure for governments to allow a cryptocurrency to replace the USD is that it will create a tremendous amount of wealth which will have positive impact on the economy. The Trojan horse is that it will also transfer wealth back to the people and possibly create a new generation of oligarchs. As the USD becomes crippled with inflation, those with literal old money will watch their hoarded fortunes dissolve. That’s the hope anyway��

This will cripple small business and further aid Amazon’s monopoly.  With the demise of cable TV, ending net neutrality will help ISP’s reshape their business models to remain profitable. It would be great for our corporate overlords and be terrible for 99.99999% of the country.
Regarding cryptocurrencies I think it’s safe to assume that ending net neutrality could lead to more centralization in mining as it will discourage solo mining by slowing down the downloading of blocks. The case for larger block sizes would also be weakened for the same reason.
If you believe that crypto (ethereum?) could lead to the Internet 3.0, then ending net neutrality could validate the need for a decentralized internet and accelerate its adoption.

You’ll likely be able to let your money work for you by owning the coins of companies using blockchain tech. Investing in utility based blockchain firms like Grid+ could provide a stable, low risk return in the future. 
A coin economy could potentially transition us to an automated world that will no longer be paying wages to most people. If we could profit off our labor replacements then we might actually have a chance to save capitalism. I’m not exactly holding my breath though. 
So basically a shitty return of interest, from a bank that is making and not sharing a ton of money off of your holdings, should be the least of your concerns.

The article misses the point. Bitcoin will push for renewable energy infrastructure world-wide which will create countless jobs. 
A major reason why bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are inefficient is because we need to upgrade our infrastructure. Bitcoin is merely creating the demand to do so.
EDIT: Bitcoin is incentivizing the push for upgraded renewable energy and digital infrastructures

Only 10% or less of trading is done by humans right now. You’d be better off creating algorithms.
You already recognize that we have a debt economy that doubles as a Ponzi scheme. You also recognize that money as we know it is in need of innovation.
My suggestion would be this... if you want to rock the boat and initiate change in the finance industry, then more power to you, we’ll need people like you to get bitcoin adopted and possibly to lead us to a token economy. That’s a little ambitious but admirable. If you’re looking for a decent job in a field that won’t fall to automation and that won’t make you miserable because of what it requires you to sacrifice of your moral self, then I’d say you should weigh your options. If you’re only in it for the money, then it doesn’t matter what you choose, your existence will be meaningless.

We allow banks to rule the world. They use our money to make outrageous amounts of money while ensnaring most of us with life long debt. They make money with our money but do not share it with us.
On top of that, centralized banks are very vulnerable to hackers. They do not share with us how much money they lose to hacking but they will share the costs of business with us.
Bitcoin is necessary if we ever want to remove the death grip that banks have on society.

Happy to help, it’s a very common question for beginners. The fractional nature of bitcoin makes it easy for almost anyone to own some. Unfortunately, most traditional investments are not meant to be widely available.
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:00:38
Sure it does. Bitcoin, and crypto in general, provides a network effect that increases its value as more people adopt it. This drives profits which drives usage. More usage will strain our infrastructure. This powerful financial motive will push leaders to upgrade the infrastructure to lower the cost of mining to increase efficiency and lower costs.
If anything, your example doesn’t really make sense because you are comparing apples to oranges.

I wouldn’t suggest buying something before you have a basic understanding of it. 
Buying bitcoin is not very similar to derivative, a contractual bet on the price movement of an asset, for several reasons but mainly because bitcoin has utility and liquidity and a derivative does not. You’re thinking bitcoin should work like a stock where you have to own an entire share. That is not the case.
The smallest unit of a bitcoin you can have is a satoshi (0.00000001). There are 100 million satoshis in a bitcoin.

When kept off of centralized exchanges and stored properly, bitcoin is more secure than fiat currency. A significant amount of cyber crime goes unreported but we do know that as of 2015 half a trillion dollars was lost by businesses to hackers per year. We really have no idea how much money banks are losing to hackers but you can bet that those costs get passed on to the consumer. 
Cryptocurrencies will ultimately be a more secure way to store and transfer data, including money, while also limiting consumer exposure to cyber crimes. It’s much easier to hack a centralized network than a decentralized network.

What could go wrong with AI exclusively controlling the direction of the world’s economy by trading Ponzi assets? At least crypto offers utility. Stocks are nothing more than speculative trades.


It was a lack of cash from new investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a Ponzi scheme as:
“An investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.”
Remove the opinion word “fraud” from the definition, and what do you have?
The stock market.
