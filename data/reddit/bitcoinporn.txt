Take extra steps and get off the blockchain completely by trading some altcoins then come back to Bitcoin as you need.

One of the benefits of Doge is I don't believe a person there believes that it will ever be worth a whole penny.  When determining what "To the Moon" may mean valuewise, I think I've seen posts that say 10 cents would be crazy, never expected.   
I also think a lot of Bitcoin users were nicer, not based on the value itself, but by being fucked over so many times by various scams, those who lost just using their coin on Dark Markets, Mt Gox had so many OG users, there really has been mass fucking overs during the BTC timeline that I believe make a lot of users bitter.

I had been away from Bitcointalk for a while now, but I definitely agree that a lot of posts here have a certain negative feel to them, not all though, and I'm hoping that will change, it's just a phase right now.  A lot of bad things have come upon Bitcoin, I mean, even Gox, though not new news, still has left a lot of users bitter.   But the technology and abilities Bitcoin has are still there, and I believe a lot of altcoins help push other boundaries that maybe Bitcoin is not able to with a switch of code, but in no way makes Bitcoin itself less valuable.  Blah, rambling, upvoting your post, this place certainly isn't as 'fun' as it was, but maybe that is because Bitcoin has it's big boy pants on and has to be taken a little more serious sometimes.
My feel at the moment is, too many "investors" trying to make money, not enough people spending.  But that is just one problem.

Of course that is how I see your comments in regards to Bitcoin.
I know every often things happen in where people put up the suicide hotline number and it's a joke to some a serious to some.  I think posts need to be up with some sort of anger/hostility hotline every so often as well.
I don't understand how you typed what you typed and expected a serious reply.  You are nucking futs if you really believe the ratio of "hopeful rich" there are the same as Bitcoin, proof is in the pudding in the transactions alone.   Of course the NASCAR sponsorship wasn't for nothing, your statements are silly, of course people using (insert ANY COIN HERE) want more people to use them.  The difference is a good amount of people in Doge want people to *use* Doge, it is definitely not the majority of threads talking about price dips and flips in the market and etc... in fact the majority of threads are amusing images and random bullshit.  It's fun and at the same time doing the same things Bitcoin is able to do.
To the moon on any coin you are invested in, sorry if you don't feel we all can't live together happily.  I use Bitcoin all the time in real world situations, Dogecoin I tip out online.  I don't represent all users of either coin I'm sure, but whatever tickles your pickle.

I believe these changes are a little insulting to 'average' people or whoever these changes are being made for.  Bitcoin use grows every day, new people get the learning curve and are smarter for it.  Dumbing down things within Bitcoin itself I don't believe will work out well, especially because there is no one Bitcoin "community" that is working together for these changes, thus will cause confusion.  I love Bitcoin as the first, original, and still my most used coin (I have had plenty of Litecoin from day one, and enjoy Dogecoin for tips online and other smaller things), I just don't see positive outcomes from this.

Yikes, too many opinions already solidified as "facts" in your post where very difficult to have an honest discussion.   
*members of the community raid and pretend it is an investment guaranteed to gain value*  - While I am sad to see some people of having negative posts over here on , it is hardly a fraction of a minority of the actual active Dogecoin users, who really don't seem to care about what is up to.  Basing your opinion that Dogecoin is a scam based on a handful of probably just Bitcoin trolls is no good for the soul, think bigger.
*Because dogecoin has no advantages over Bitcoin and no reason to exist* - Odd opinion is odd to me.  The differences in Dogecoin and Bitcoin are I feel significant ones, while it is pure opinion to say what is an advantage or not in the coins, there are differences enough.
I personally see the "scam coins" as the ones that are pre-mined basically.   Bitcoin Wiki is not a great way to back up a point lol.  Your opinions are yours though, still curious if you personally find any altcoin to be legit and what ones you feel are scams?
Note: Currently only have Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Namecoin.  Have had Litecoin, Nyancoin (got for free from their subreddit, traded for other coin on Cryptsy as soon as I could lol), and Blackcoin (an interesting coin in how it works with the "Proof of Stake", but not something I fully believe is a good way, but time will tell on it)

Twitch is already down with Dogecoin and will be having that integrated, not sure why other coins could not be implemented 
"Twitch is an extremely flexible platform and developers of all kinds are using it in a lot of interesting ways. Whether it was the advent of Twitch Play games where chat was used to control a game of Pokemon or how Vlambeer offered subscribers to their channel a new way to purchase their game, there is no shortage of ideas that reflect how Twitch is the first to successfully usher in the era of social video for gamers. Dogecoin, which is a great fit for Twitch since it also boasts a remarkably supportive community, is one more example of our robust API in action."

*I will define an advantage as something that makes it more secure, or have more utility. It has neither.* - I do not call the difference in see in the finite amount of coins Bitcoin will produce versus Dogecoin that will be providing rewards for miners indefinitely a advantage/disadvantage, and not fully sure your definition of 'utility', but the difference between the two coins with that change alone is significant imo, no way scam, just a difference in belief in how the program is run.
I think there is definitely a poor representation of some Dogecoin users in in some threads going on upvote/downvote parties or bickering matches with users here (which surprises the hell out of me when I see it), but stepping back seeing the real world differences that people are doing with Dogecoin (both with charity and promotional efforts) versus any other coin I have used, while all these Doge people could have done these things with BTC, for whatever reason, they haven't.   If the people aren't basing their use of the coins on the technical differences, then there is definitely a difference how the communities treat each others and more importantly, people new to crypto currency, which will make a world of difference long term. 
 I'm rambling now, I know it's all opinions here, and if Dogecoin started as a scam, so be it, I don't agree with that, but even if it was so, I think it's a different ball game already and it's only 5/6 months in. Lots of genuine users doing genuine things with the coin in attempts to have that legitimacy.

I'm thinking it may be best to not have one Foundation for Bitcoin right now, but rather all the various Bitcoin communities should start their own projects.   Bitcointalk can be doing a project right now, can be doing something, the Bitcoin Stack Exchange could be funding or spearheading something.  In the end it will only be good for Bitcoin, but no one should try and be the 'voice' of Bitcoin at this point in the game.

I have spoke to IRL friends about Bitcoin for years upon years, when value was around two bucks.  It took something like Dogecoin for these same mother fuckers (a term I'm sure a lot of people call our friends) to download a "digital wallet" to their phones and actually take the time to get some.    
I have 4 friends who dig Doge, one of them uses Coinbase to buy Bitcoin and then he converts it to Doge through exchanges (he was using Cryptsy but I told him to stay off that for now).  One of the others is into a whole slew of other coins and day trading pump and dump craps now.  One of them now has BTC and Doge instead of just Doge.  The last just has the Doge that I gave him for free lol, but he enjoys the things going on within the Dogecoin world/community.  BTC does not have a friendly face and others think the value is too high to just jump in (and I don't think the bits/mBTC stuff going on is a proper solution to that issue, but now I'm rambling into things to make posts in other threads about, oh hell this whole post was a ramble)

This is where having a 'community' comes in handy.  I don't believe just the "Big Players" singularly made the Jamaicans go to the Winter Olympics or putting those Water Wells in Kenya or NASCAR.  Not that they didn't help, but I believe it was more so the masses putting just a little bit in each.      has a larger userbase overall (however Dogecoin does seem to be more active, like right now there is just about double the amount of Doge users online 1,056 than Bitcoin 575)
Something *can* be done to get enough of the community to get together.  Maybe it isn't sponsoring a fighter through Joe Rogan (example as I'm seeing that on the front page of this sub), but something more tech related or even freedom/politics related that will get to group together and do something positive that will have the side effect of getting the Bitcoin label in peoples faces as a real thing.   I have hopes is all.  But I guess it wouldn't hurt to find out who some of the big players are around these parts and see what their interest are (who they be with, things that make them smile, what numbers to dial, they going to be here for a while, we gonna call our crew, you... sorry, it's late and your user name got rap on my mind).

I do not know your history with Satoshis, I'm sorry I missed that I didn't back that further.   If not just term itself, the amount that it represents I like more than attempting to change the mindset of where the decimal is at in relation to a full Bitcoin (seeing the mBTC or uBTC as my view on sites/wallets/pages/etc, I rather see the 0.3285184 BTC).  This is just my preference though. 
I don't agree with the comparison of this to 'wallets', as that is just a term to something people already were going to use, we could name that anything.    Btw, I honestly at some points get confused as it seems there is two situations going on that I don't like, the terms themselves being changed along with what view people are changing things to.
I think the door to door approach (not battle) is how growth in users will happen.  Things like Dogecoin really aid matters imo, and I am for the use of multiple coins rather than everything resting on one coin (for multiple reasons as well, not just the mindset of value, but that is rambling for another thread, but all my posts are rambles anyways).

A little blurb [from Ars]( about this arrest, sad to read - 
Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde was arrested in Southern Sweden on Saturday, Reuters reported. Sunde was convicted of aiding copyright infringement in 2009 and was sentenced to a year in prison, plus a fine. That year of jail time was reduced to eight months, but in 2012 Sunde failed to appear at the Swedish prison where he was to be incarcerated, and he has been wanted by Interpol ever since.
Sunde, who was arrested in the Swedish county of Skane, had been living in Berlin when Ars caught up with him a month ago. He had recently launched a campaign to represent Finland as a member of the European Parliament, and he seemed fairly confident that he would not be taken into custody. As Ars reported in May:
”In a Skype text chat with Ars, Sunde said that his standing conviction in Sweden isn’t a barrier to his running for office, nor has it been a barrier for his ability to live and travel throughout Europe.
“Well, I have multiple appeals in and few people looking for me,” he said. “As in, there's no need for me to be in Sweden, and basically no one wants me to go to prison. So no one looks for me outside of Sweden.
“It's quite easy to cross borders in Europe without any controls. And the Nordic Union, don't forget—the Nordic countries has been passport-free since ages before Schengen,” Sunde added. He was referring to the Schengen Agreement, which has effectively eliminated internal passport control within Europe.
Sunde said that he wasn’t sure if there was a warrant out for his arrest in Sweden.
“No idea,” he said. “Probably? Well, besides not being a hard criminal, nor being in Sweden, I also have no €10 million ($13.8 million) to give anyone.”
It is unclear why Sunde was in Sweden at the time of his arrest, and Swedish officials have not provided further details.
Sunde and three other Pirate Bay principles who were also found guilty of violating copyright law had put in multiple appeals over the last several years to try to overturn the convictions, largely without success (one of the earlier convictions reduced the Pirate Bay co-founders' prison sentences, but increased the fines they'd have to pay). The Swedish Supreme Court declined to hear Sunde's appeal in February 2012, so the Pirate Bay leaders took their case to the European Court of Human Rights, which then dismissed their case unanimously as “inadmissable.”
One of the other Pirate Bay co-founders, Gottfrid “anakata” Svartholm Warg, was apprehended in Cambodia in late 2012 and remains in Swedish custody. In June 2013 he was also charged with hacking and fraud and sentenced to two years in prison. Fredrik “tiamo” Neij, another co-founder, has not yet served time and appears to still live in Laos with his wife.

As someone who has Bitcoin and Dogecoin, and spends them both regular (Bitcoin using Gyft and some online stores, Dogecoin I tip people and charities like mad), I'm against the bits, the mBTCs, and the whole trying to change the decimal, I believe trying to change those things would hurt Bitcoin overall.  This attempt at change is pissing me off lol.  Different strokes for different folks.

Where are you seeing your commentary from?  I don't know when the last time I seen speculation posts hitting their front page or even whines about value dropping and etc.
People seem to be pretty level headed in in regards to knowing Doge will never see BTC fiat value numbers, more so focused on 1 Doge = 1 Doge and the real world value/changes Dogecoin has versus that fiat value (just reading the below threads makes me smile about the Doge community).  Btw, long time Bitcoin user here and I love the fuck out of both coins.
  
 
@_date: 2014-05-12 04:03:05
And what about people into both coins, must we all be fucking off?
Much denial here that Bitcoin is the father of all the other crypto currencies, so if something positive and big is going on with the other coins, it is going to hit Bitcoin front page too, which if you are like me, and do like and enjoy Bitcoin use, it isn't a bad thing to see what innovations are going on with the tech or the community/non-tech side of these other coins.

You are saying what I'm thinking in way less words.   I hope folks here realize, it's already been working for plenty of other coins, and not just talking Doge here either.  It's not a matter of they will get these penny tips and be like "fuck yeah, money!" and try and cash out, it's just something neat that has a real world value, and with Bitcoin, there is that bonus knowledge that the value itself has gone up like a stock, where any penny they have owned before has never done that (unless they were into penny stocks har har)

Bought into Bitcoin at $2 in 2011, loved it ever since.    People are crazy to think that it will be the only coin that will have value.
Original poster cracks me up, proudly makes a post exclaiming that he sold at a low point and bought at high points.   Dogecoin will be around for quite a while more, along with some other alt coins I'm sure. 
A lot of needs to redirect their negative alt coin energy toward positive things for Bitcoin (or if they must be negative, find ways to stop things like PayPal by making it easier for everyone to want to replace it, for example)
And also stop with the bullshit uBTC, bits, etc.  Bring it to Satoshi's and Bitcoin as the terms.     Now i'm rambling.  So much better things can be on the front page of this subreddit right now.

I don't like generalizing Bitcoin users, there are so many, but from when I first posted on years ago until now, it definitely feels much different. I understand the landscape is different with much  more acceptance and a shitload more altcoins.  Maybe it's time for each Bitcoin community starts doing projects on their own, some of the larger Bitcoin forums, Bitcointalk itself, and can all branch off and take on projects that fit the feel of the users of each of these different communities.  I don't know, i'm rambling, but attitude definitely has to start shifting to something more positive/supportive.

You are extremely cute Saffron.   
If you ever want to push Bitcoin hard, I would suggest having some text on the screen or something written in the background of scenes showing the benefits for the consumer to use Bitcoin to be able to pay you for your services/videos (I guess things like "anonymous" payments or ideas about cutting out middlemen/payment processors and knowing they are giving directly to you).   Even subliminal things in the background that may say "bitcoin preferred" or "bitcoin accepted here"
If you ever want to get some extra cash, I would suggest checking into different alt coins and make individual videos supporting them as well (as you can always go to an exchange and change the coin to Bitcoin in the end if that is what you only want)

Why isn't a Bitcoin'er approaching him with a bag full of fiat money or Bitcoin to sponsor an event Joe Rogan will be doing?    I don't think this is on Joe at all, he is doing fine allowing his show be a vehicle to help educate people on not just Bitcoin, but digital currencies as a whole (on top of Andreas, he has had Alexis Ohanian, reddit co-founder and shibe/Dogecoin user on as well).

There is something about eGifter I just do not like as much as Gyft (the UI is one thing).  I wish Gyft would start with accepting some other coins.    Still, since eGifter is providing the service others are not, got to try and support the one supporting multiple coins.   "Speak with your wallet" as they say.
@_date: 2014-05-12 05:05:39
*why attack altcoins when what is good for one is good for the other? Because it isn't true.* - I said what I said exactly how I meant it, if there is a good marketing initiative that went on for any coin (let's use the NASCAR/Doge thing as an example), then I would believe that should be seen as a positive for Bitcoin and similar ideas could be incorporated in the community side.   A larger market is a more stable one is true, but also true is people accepting the market at all, people taking into account Bitcoin and the things it can do are real.  
*If you want to actually see cryptocurrency succeed, you would only financially support bitcoin.*   -  lol, silly attitude.  I use Bitcoin the most in as far as finances are concerned, both as an investment (as the current fiat value price of BTC is so damn low compared to what it will be, not only long term, but short term imo) and I spend BTC (gyft'ed someone a $20 Papa Johns gift card just today, not the greatest of mother's day gift, but wasn't my mom, anyways, digressing here, sorry).   I don't get what your point in the one coin attitude.
Sidechains do nothing for me at the moment, I am not aware of the positives of being tied to Bitcoin's finite total number, but I fully admit I'm not educated enough on sidechains or how some of the very different ways some altcoins are made could just be made into a sidechain (example, Blackcoin and it's 'Proof of Stake' variant, could that be made into a sidechain?).  I just overall do not see it as a positive thing to have all coins tied to one/Bitcoin's network.

I don't agree with how this is said or probably the extent you may believe it, but there is definitely a point in there.  Maybe the balance of all this is multiple coin types rather than overfocus on just Bitcoin.

Bitcoin too expensive and hard to get involved in ?    Silly attitude is silly !  
It takes just as much money to get Bitcoin as it does Dogecoin or any other coin, it's all a matter of how much you put in :)     Bitcoin is accepted in way more places than Dogecoin currently, but is used in very different ways.
Both coins ftw :)

Not only did I read it, I did done wrote it too!  What I am saying, is Bitcointalk.org was once a community, may be considered it's own BTC community, but Bitcoin is so spread, with ideas on what is good for the coin and what isn't is so spread, that there is no Bitcoin community.  So therefore, I am shitting on nothing, as it doesn't exist.       
What I am not saying, is that Bitcoin can't do big things or people into Bitcoin cannot get together and use the coin for positive things (including promotion of the coin), but to say it is because of a " Bitcoin community" effort is not right.  imo.    
Bitcoin is very large with many communities within, but so large that I don't believe all the users can all get together and agree on much of anything a this point.  I very much stand by my original post and I'm very much letting you know if you believe that "trying to shit on the bitcoin community" is what I was trying to say, you are wrong, as your statement doesn't make sense, I don't believe there is a singular 'bitcoin community'

Agreed with this.   Been into Litecoin day one and have since left it behind, I actual use Vericoin (mind you it is because the wallet has the useful feature of being able to make payments in BTC directly, so I use VRC when paying eGifter for example)), have in the past made many donations and tips in Dogecoin, and love the not only tech differences in the alts, I just love that more than one digital coin exists, and consider that a huge positive in itself.
Where Bitcoin may be used solely in the examples of the things I use alts for above, the other features AND communities/marketing/the non tech stuff, keeps me using altcoins as well.

Step 1) I use FeedZeBirds.com to create a campaign - this takes 30 seconds as I just sign in with my twitter account. No ID verification. No bank account. No lengthy forms of any kind. All made irrelevant by Bitcoin.
Step 2) I seed the campaign (I've chosen to send 2 btc). Money is approved after 6 confirmations - so an hour after the idea crosses my mind, the campaign is live.
Step 3) There isn't even a step 3
The campaign message is now available for Twitter users around the world to propagate my propaganda. and quickly toss  There is a public donation address on the campaign so people who ALSO support the idea can toss in a coin and keep it going. Many of the people who tweet the message will have it appear in Facebook, making it even more viral as those who support the cause can click the link and contribute - earning bitcoins themselves by retweeting or adding bitcoins to the fund.

Vegetta handled things super shitty, and if anything, could be the reason why he is not able to execute certain parts of a growing site, including how to handle yourself publicly.

I feel an alternative thought is to bring more real world items that we cannot spend Bitcoin on currently, and find ways to pay for those things.  Not enough variety currently where I think that should be a focus.  That shouldn't hinder current business' find ways to advertise the coin itself more.  They have to know they can't just push themselves, they have to push a little knowledge on people too.

I full admit my ignorance on this topic.  Google has already invested much money, time, effort, etc into solar power.

I see Vegetta as young as all hell, it comes through with how he writes.  And if he isn't, oh well lol.  However, age aside, his attitude to going about this web site is that of someone who has only built up non-adult sites, which I have personally found to be a way different game than building regular sites.    
I get confused by everyone saying King was helping him, she had a specific cam site it seems in her mind, run the way established successful cam sites are done, that is not what I seen Vegetta was going for.  His site is banking off of the new technology from what I could gather, not trying to just be a cam site with Bitcoin added, the Bitcoin would be the focus as far as transactions (if this is all wrong, I am going off of memory, that thread happened a while ago, it is just funny seeing it on reddit, and even funnier is that I think people feel the need to pick a side, when everyone is clearly wrong in some way in that thread, so I choose Vegetta, way obvious underdog lol).

I tend to believe that people are not reading the thread.  Jokes aside (the jokes being the 'dom is dom lulz', not saying it is funny, even though I think it is), I feel most her points reflected a basis of the site being different than whatever the vision Vegetta had.   Her points worked for the situations she was describing, the fact that she dismisses Vegetta being able to realistically get his site off the ground is a shit assumption, and I stick by that opinion.
People claimed to not have read everything fully, especially saying that I am associated with Vegetta's site, so yeah, I will generally assume that a sad occurrence of 'white knighting' is going on (just because I don't give a shit enough to verify if every single person is reading every single post in that thread and thus knows what is going on, I go based on people are reading the headline of the reddit and jump on board).
Vegetta was in the wrong in attitude I think, Jesse was in the wronger for the same reason (she is a dom though lulz).  They could have worked together I'm sure.

My biggest fear is Google taking over mining and regulating or making a steady Bitcoin price by really just dumping their free energy from solar or wind and generating the coin.
I have my tin foil hat right here, but it just seems more realistic than the other weird theories.  The reason I feel this theory is realistic, is the only thing Google ever wants from anyone, is control.  This would be one the ultimate ways they could do it.
btw I love Google and want this to happen.

@_date: 2011-07-14 02:00:40
We can admit there is value in holding power, right?  Whatever the price you feel it is, cheap or expensive, the value of that energy/power is there, right?
For example, let's say Google did generate and hold excess power, why would you think investing = poorly run?
Follow up, Google would Google themselves, do you really think they would run out of ideas for what to do with power?
I do not assume they are generating excess power right now, I'm sure the whole purpose of their solar and/or wind is purely to better those technologies.  However, tin foil hat back on, what is to stop Google for controlling mining using this method?
It even fits with their "Do No Evil" mantra, as if anything, they will make right of the evil things this Bitcoin is used for (since Bitcoin is not accepted through Paypal and you can't buy shit at Walmart in it, Bitcoin is not evil by definition yet, but things are going that direction)

Someone representing Bit Trust shows themselves 
"I found this thread criticizing everything they could about bittrust.org. Disclaimer I am behind it. As regards innovation people have short attention spans, first they ridicule the concept, then as it gains traction suggest it's dangerous, then they copy it and claim it was nothing special while their version is the best on the market. That's competition and I know it well, but I also know a good idea when i see it, Bitcoin is a bloody good idea despite the current market turbulence and the solution and system I am developing for it is also a bloody good idea. Further disclaimer I didn't waste more than 1 hour on the initial landing pages so those who have criticized them may well have a point, but trust is earned over time not and not lost by a few naysayers who are more than likely wished they hadn't the foresight to build the concept themselves."

From the maker 
The common question "How long will it take for my transaction to be confirmed?" has no easy answer. 10 to 60 minutes is often said, but transactions can be confirmed in a block in less than 10 minutes and sometimes take longer than 60 minutes, which causes consternation. 
I have created a website that shows how long recent transactions have taken to be confirmed in a block. 
Seeing this Transaction Timer chart, users can get an idea of how long transactions tend to take to be confirmed in a block by seeing the distribution of past transactions. In the future, I can show the fee amount paid which will be quite relevant as miners become more picky about which transactions they choose to include in blocks. 
The site will always be free; I made it for the benefit of the Bitcoin community, especially new users. 
I welcome comments and suggestions.. especially concerning the "Count" statistic on the third tab. (I think that it is possible to manipulate this statistic and I'm curious if people think that malicious people do. The info is gleaned by counting the number of unique IPs in addr messages.)

I do see what you are saying.  It would have to be some crazy motivations or some unknown factor to cause Google to want to invest in Bitcoin more so than they are now (which I believe is just one guy who works for Google that is into Bitcoin at the moment, but that's just how it starts! lol)
Possible (but even then they would have to surprise everyone and flip a switch, I'm sure pools would be prepared if they knew that was going to happen, or even just a mass movement of all users not wanting one entity to have that much control), but not probable.
