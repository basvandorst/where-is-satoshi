gotta echo that. Let's have more puzzles with smaller prizes easier to solve.

u/frankybet, Can you please confirm that there are no mistakes in some lines?
There are 12 words to look for but we got 14 digits and only one date per digits 10, 13 and 14.

Thank you for creating that amazing challenge. It was one of the most interesting things I stumbled upon and I learned in a few days more about cryptography than in 28 years. It doesn't matter I didn't get anything from the pie, I don't regeret a bit the hours I spent on this.

OK, so this generates the new numbers grid:
310 310 310 310 310
1AA 0FC 32D 544 78F 643
42C 5C7 490 2F4 36E 43B
But how on the next step you convert these numbers to the numbers which gives the bip39 word code?
EDIT: figured it. You ignore the 310s and just convert the rest from hex to decimal.

12th word is not *apology*. It was for the previus puzzle. For this one we know just the 6th one is *escape*.

Thanks, saw it there.

Two hints were given last 10 days, please, check the thread.

Someone on Btctalk posted how the 0.1 BTC was solved. It seems I'm too ignorant to understand it so I'd appreciate if someone explains it to the public. Here is the solution:
  
SOLUTION TO THE WALLET WITH .1 BTC  
•   The numbers grid can translate the hex codes.  Oct 2 2018 is the key to the grid when you use it as the shift key for decoding.  You get a new grid  
      310 310 310 310 310 310   
      1AA 0FC 32D 5FF 78F 643   
      42C 5C7 490 2F4 36E 43B  
Tool to convert hex numbers to decimals: [   
426    cry  
252    buyer  
813    grain  
1535    save  
1935    vault  
1603    sign  
1068    lyrics  
1479    rhythm  
1168    music  
756    fury  
878    horror  
1083   mansion  
Now the questions:
1) Where do you see the Oct 2 2018 on the image?
2) How these numbers translate to these words (426=cry, etc...)?

lol dude, you made my day!

The string contains one V only: MDLPDAHWEESFPTAEIDROGANSEROCSBOLVEUSSORPAHLPATROPNENEIOTRTGMPDREEDD.
How do you get "involve" from that?
