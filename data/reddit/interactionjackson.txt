the article mentions a $250 daily limit. I was told I can only buy $40. what gives?

isn't that how dinosaurs came about?

It doesn't seem like she got screwed to me. She told the irs that she wasn't going to pay taxes. irs collects. Seems like the proper course of action to me.

It's cute that you think we still have rights. Now, I don't know the details of her situation or under what context of the tax laws that she would fall under and by no means am I implying that she is in the wrong or that what the gov is doing is right but... [the IRS can take your property without a warrant.](
edit: also [tax levies](

:/ Sorry to hear it.

liberty.me link is broken.
link to happy wheels is sticking out like a sore thumb on the bottom of the page.
don't take this the wrong way but it looks like someone quickly threw this online in an attempt to cash in on the current hype surrounding bitcoin. I'll upvote 'cause I would like to bring awareness to bitcoin and cause I would like to attend.

I would this
@_date: 2014-01-13 02:16:25
The site isn't resolving at the moment. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:27:16
The happy wheels link is still there. Just above the footer div and below the wrapper div. 
And tickets should be at /tickets and not /?page_id=7

He said currency and investment are two different things so I hear his advice as, investing in bitcoin is a greater risk than if you were to buy and use bitcoins. Consume them as currency and you slightly mitigate your risk.

I buy gift cards via gyft for everyday stuff. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:26:10
buy btc. use btc to make everyday purchases. repeat. Additionally ask everywhere you shop if they accept btc. even if you know that they don't. ask anyway. 
edit: also be prepared to tell them how to accept btc if they become inquisitive. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:28:41
I know you mentioned GAE but maybe a similar set up for you would work. I use gyft to buy amazon gift cards and pay for aws account with that. The caveat is that I need to have a valid credit card registered in the account before I can pay w/ a gift card. I'm not sure how feasible it is but you might want to look into buying something like visa cash cards w/ btc.

In my experience, they increment it based on your usage. I was recently allowed to do up to 2gs from my cc. For me, I don't think it will go much higher than that. I've never needed to do that much in one transactions. Your mileage may vary. 
edit: sorry, i know that's not very much help.
@_date: 2015-04-28 00:45:40
I'm really glad to see you attempt something like this. I'd like to refer to your experience as a base case for proposing this to my higher ups so I wish you the best of luck. My hesitation in broaching the topic has been what you just mentioned here. the 'logistics' of it all. I concur w/ you that it's more expensive to use btc and even w/ the 0% fee there is always the potential for loss between the time that btc is purchased and subsequently used in exchange for goods. Buy and hold and hope isn't a convincing argument either. I hope this goes over well. Please let us know how it goes.
@_date: 2015-11-20 17:36:16
No IL either

still doesn't make sense. btc is a store of value, eth is smart contracts. They can live in the same eco-system. There isn't going to be any one crypto to rule them all. Especially, not any time soon.
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:09:50


It still isn't. They serve separate purposes. an analogy is that Btc is  dollars or money, and eth is for deeds and titles. This goes to show that the majority of those interested in this space are still looking at the money and how much they compare to each other instead of looking at the code and asking themselves, "What problem does this solve and how big is the global impact of solving that problem"
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:42:51


I'm confused here. BTC is an implementation of a block chain. So yeah, i can see how that statement is true, but it's only telling half the story.


Not wrong. Not even close. We already have blockchains that aren't BTC. So, this doesn't make sense to me. Also, need to keep in mind that blockchains aren't strictly financial. Blockchains maintain state. That idea can be applied to a myriad of applications.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:45:17
Why not both? I don't see ETH and BTC as competitors. These two will be side by side for a long time as each provides a unique use case. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:05:42
no more than the euro has replaced the American dollar. Which is to say, no. You're wrong. There isn't going to be one coin to rule them all. Blockchain tech can be written to fulfill a myriad of use cases. the least interesting of those are currencies. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:01:08


what makes you say that? a fork?


If i understand correctly, you're saying that btc needs to drop significantly in an effort to force the weak willed to sell their positions?
