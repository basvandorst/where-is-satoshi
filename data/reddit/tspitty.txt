It’s photoshop. No doubt something like this exists, this was mocked up though fur sure.

Yeah and if you bought Apple stock when it first came out you’d be rich too. People have understood the value of Gold for thousands of years. It’s always been a sound investment. If you bought Apple now, that doesn’t mean you’re going to a millionaire in ten years. It already boomed.

Sure religion has had it's share of fuck ups throughout history but at a local level religions do more than bitcoin. I'm not religious at all, but local churches here helped rebuild houses and fed people in the the community affected by major flooding. Bitcoin is a currency, not an organization. It's like saying fiat hasn't done anything to make the world a better place. It's pretty stupid if you think about it for more than half a second.

Yeah and if you bought Bitcoin two years ago you’d be down 50%. If you bought Gold two years ago you’d be up 15%.

You’re missing the point. The boom already happened. You’re not going to make those returns anymore. The post was comparing each as an investment opportunity. It had nothing to do with utility.

I can’t help you understand the stupidity of OPs post. I’m sorry. Don’t get sentimental about your investments.

So you’re saying it’s not idiot proof? Good luck going main stream then. Fiat is idiot proof, which makes it incredibly useful. Everyone can use it easily.
