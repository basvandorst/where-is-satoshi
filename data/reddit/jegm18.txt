@_date: 2018-01-03 21:44:45
No I’m not, it crashed because it got too expensive for most people; bitcoin literally ran out of people to keep investing in it, just like a pyramid scheme ; or you tell me, what service does bitcoin provide or why is it valuable to you ??
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:56:50
No it’s not

Use the CashApp; you can accept payments in cash or BTC. They even issue debit cards, which you can use wherever Visa chip cards are accepted. You don’t need a bank at all.
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:14:54

In Spanish, Fiar, means to sell as debt; therefore, fiat money is debt money, currency loaned to you with interest; and you pay that interest with inflation 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:11:02

@_date: 2017-12-29 06:35:00

Plan B is printing more “money”, that’s what the supposed “forks” are 
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:52:12
I would go for it ; either way if the stock market crashes or bitcoin crashes you lose after all, but like you said you will have larger gains with bitcoin and YOU will be in control of your money, not some investment firm making money off of YOUR hard work. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:26:32
Well he’s CIA, so...
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:22:09

@_date: 2017-12-11 04:52:16

@_date: 2017-12-15 03:30:56
They’ve been saying that about the stock market for years 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:06:08
Use  he Segwit blockchain 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:47:24
This guy has been predicting an economic crash for years now , why would you listen to someone that’s consistently wrong ??
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:49:40

I still play lottery but just $10 to $15 bucks a week; that’s nothing, I stopped buying beer to make up the difference; and if I ever win anything I’m putting all in crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:24:58
Thanks I’ve been looking for something like that too 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:48:33
England ? You mean piece of shit garbage island ? Yeah ok 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:13:08
That’s true the odds of making a profit in crypto are much better than the lottery 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:53:50
So you’re showing off your total portfolio but not the holdings ? What difference does that make ? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:13:15
Everything’s a pyramid scheme these days

@_date: 2017-12-25 15:58:42
Then you wonder why BTC is losing the market 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:05:38
You probably feel ashamed most of that is in BTC; and total USD dollars invested was $75,000 hahaha 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:50:03
Segwit has cheaper fees 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:56:32
Next they’re gonna blame cow farts for “global warming” ... oh wait
