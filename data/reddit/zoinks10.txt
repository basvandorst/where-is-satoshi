No. Futures are cash settled. So if I sell futures I’m essentially entering into a bet that says ‘I believe Bitcoin will be worth less than the strike price of the future at the expiry date of the future’. As an example maybe I sell futures for March 2018 at $20k usd. If the price is less than $20k in March 2018 then I ‘win’ and get the difference between the market price and the $20k strike price. If the price is greater than $20k in March 2018 then I ‘lose’ and owe the difference between $20k and whatever the price is. 
No bitcoins have changed hands in order to make this bet. It’s a bit like having a bet on how much a pint of beer will be in the pub round the corner - no one needs to drink the beer to have a winner and a loser. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:42:49
I guess - futures are just an agreement to buy or sell something in the future for an agreed price. That price is typically different to the prevailing market price (spot price) because there’s an expectation that the asset will be worth more or less in the future. Options also have a strike price (and you can get all different types of price - both in and out of the money) the difference is that the person writing the option just gets paid a fee (a bit like an insurance cost) and the person paying the fee is not bound to exercise their option (so if the price isn’t favourable then they won’t bother and they’ll just pay the fee).

To be fair if you’re buying bitcoin and not using it in the hopes of a price rise then that’s also pure gambling.

Doesn’t matter if it’s a future on Bitcoin or any other underlying asset. If we enter a futures contract we are betting on the price of bitcoin at the expiry of the future (e.g. March 2018). We then wait until March 2018 and see what the price actually is before settling for cash. Maybe I sell futures to you at $20k for March 2018 - if the price is less than $20k you owe me the difference between $20k and the actual price. If the price is more than $20k I owe you the difference between $20k and the actual price. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:14:45
I see it as a useful tool for Holders. As we have seen when the price crossed $10k, everyone has their own personal Moon. If I see the futures price at my own moon then I can sell those, wait until the expiry and then selll off my bitcoin to settle the futures bet knowing I’ve agreed to sell at that future price.

If I've learned anything from holding these coins for the past 4 years, it's that NO-ONE has a fucking clue why the price goes up and NO-ONE has a fucking clue why the price goes back down again.

As I understand it there's a publicly verifiable address on the blockchain with approximately that number of coins in it. That does not prove that a trust (or any other entity) owns the coins, no-one knows whether the person(s) that put them there still have the keys to access them or not, but they are known to be there and are actively watched by some members of the community as if such a large percentage of all coins starts moving then people will notice (whether they're liquidating their holding or doing something else entirely, you can guarantee a ~~conspiracy~~ story will come out to explain it on @_date: 2015-06-30 08:06:21
I suppose you could at least load your bitcoin onto a paper wallet, laptop or USB stick and just walk across the border with an enormous amount of monetary value. Try doing that with cash - most countries have very strict limits on the amount of money that you can bring in or out of the country in physical form - much easier to dodge that with BTC.

Indeed - my comment was a response to the idea that BTC couldn't be in a safe store of value and transportable. Taking cash across most international borders has a large number of controls. No idea whether those Greeks that are near the border could potentially walk into another country and withdraw more of their Euro holdings (because they use a foreign bank machine by a non-Greek bank) or whether the ATM systems/control systems in place apply purely to Greek account withdrawals regardless of where they're performed.

You never know. At the time I won the money in the Casino near the Zambian border.

It was literally worthless to anyone in exchange for other fiat currencies.

@_date: 2015-06-30 08:02:11
Is there any possibility of the (reported) increase in interest from Greece [in Bitcoin specifically] being driven by corporates that need to make cross-border transactions? The reason I ask is because all cross-border transactions are blocked, barring a few corporate transactions that need prior Government approval - so this could be a method to circumvent that. 
Although the flip-side is that it would also depend on the corporates being sat on either a store of Bitcoin (unlikely) or being able to buy them (even less likely).

@_date: 2015-05-11 05:55:57
My take on it (and I am very late to this party) is that a lot of corporations are looking at it and interested in the underlying technology, but not yet convinced how they might actually leverage it in the real world. This is one of the first concrete use-cases I've seen where they are keen on using the actual Bitcoin blockchain rather than just the technology itself with their own blockchain (although perhaps other banking institutions were also thinking along these lines and didn't announce it). 
TL;DR, if they're really using the same blockchain that underpins Bitcoin it makes the first time I've seen it stated publicly by such an institution, and hopefully their need to prove it works for their requirements would lead to investment in bitcoin development using their own tech team.
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:50:13
Maybe. I suppose there's also the possibility that the customer accounts and shareholdings are actually held within Nasdaq's own proprietary platform, and they just use the blockchain/the coloured coins as a convenient mechanism to verify when a transaction has been successfully completed without relying on a clearing house. This would potentially speed up the clearing time, reduce the risk, and then free up the coloured bitcoins for re-use in another stock trading situation within the Nasdaq implementation.
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:14:57
I presume the trading takes place on a Nasdac supported screen (the same way you might buy a bitcoin on an exchange), but they plan to use coloured coins to perform the settlement via the block chain, enabling a t+0 settlement. That's the exciting part for me. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 01:22:32
Is there a way of "un-colouring" coins too? So, for example, I colour a coin to make it represent 100 Apple shares and send it to someone else. Once they receive this (and presumably wait for the physical/slower actual settlement of the Apple shares), can that person un-colour the coin and spend it as a "normal" bitcoin again (or even change the colour to represent another stock that they own and want to sell on)?
The reason for asking is that the more coins get coloured, the less "normal currency" coins would exist (given a finite number of actual coins), and this could actually lead to price inflation as the money supply is drawn into representing shares rather than representing monetary value.
Or maybe I just don't know enough.
@_date: 2015-05-11 05:59:31
Agreed - you get a discount when you "make" a market and your order gets filled. If this needs explaining to anyone they really should avoid trading altogether.
@_date: 2015-05-11 05:43:29
With any luck their tech leads would be savvy enough to persuade management of the need to contribute in some way to the overall architecture that they depend upon.

Perhaps some mechanism to move from credit card (where people feel comfortable) to bitcoin, to merchant would be the best way. Merchants don't really hoard bitcoin at the moment (they swap it straight to fiat in most cases), so why would a consumer want exposure to this currency either. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:43:38
OK, thanks. So in theory I could also take my coloured bitcoins (assuming I'd bought some stock on Nasdaq) and then accidentally send them on as regular bitcoins, and the stock would be lost forever (in the same way bitcoins are if, for example, I sent them to an address whose private keys are lost). Is that right?

Sure, but this doesn't look into the fact that the settlement in this case is for securities that are somehow linked to the coloured coins being exchanged via the blockchain.

I look at this from a cultural perspective - Indians and Chinese just like gold, as gifts, as a store of wealth, and as a symbolic show of wealth. There are currently several billion Indians and Chinese, and they're getting more populous by the day. They are also getting more wealthy. 
Gold might not do anything in the short term (it might sink more for all I know) but long term there are a ready store of buyers that will have more and more purchasing power. I'll be one of the guys holding a gold pet rock that's willing to sell it to them.

This is probably the biggest hurdle I think this community has at the moment. When you first start looking at Bitcoin and discover some crypto-nerd that has a mind-key with 78 random words in 15 languages to store his 87 cents of bitcoin it kind of puts you off. 
If you're storing a few hundred bucks of value on a cell phone wallet then it's about as risky as carrying the cell phone and having that stolen in the first place. A sensible discussion on the difference between buy-and-hold long term storage/speculation security and day-to-day expenses security is probably necessary for the uninitiated.

The necessity to discharge a firearm in Singapore is not very high. Crime is almost zero - you can leave your wallet on a table to reserve your space at a food court and it won't be stolen. 20% tax is on earnings over 320,000 sgd per year (200+ USD) and anyone can own a car - you just have to decide it's worth the price (which is no different to anywhere else in the world, just the price is higher). 
Military service is for males only, and when was the last time you heard of a Singaporean kid coming home in a body bag? Far more US servicemen and women get fucked by the wars the US fight than ever get killed serving for Singapore. 
On the upside their kids will grow up in a safe environment with limited crime and an excellent set of public services paid for at a low tax rate. Education opportunities will be awesome. Public transport is a thing that actually works and is available at a cheap and convenient price and location. Also, you can travel to a range of places nearby that are all awesome. 
I can easily see why they choose to ditch their American passport and stay in Singapore. It's not like the USA doesn't have the death penalty anyway.

If your concern is that one goes bust, spreading your money reduces your exposure. If your concern is the haircut from the government then spreading the balance means it's less likely to be over the threshold they will give a haircut to.

They have little choice - the business needs to deposit it's fiat somewhere and with capital controls in place the banks are the only option. As such spreading your risk is about the best you can hope for. 
I imagine in the worst case scenario they will have a large run on their own fiat stores in the machine, which may at least mitigate some of the risk.

I just moved to a new office and needed to reset the pin on the door lock so only my staff could get in. The "Master Pin" is required to do this - which the previous tenant had left as the devilishly difficult-to-guess "123456" that the original manufacturer made. Literally any time I see the same door-code unit I can change the pin without knowing the existing pin just because the OEM set it up to be the least secure door lock in the world.

Fair enough, I just thought learning something like Linux would be something easy enough to learn vs learning how to crack the encryption.

How or why would you retire on $60k a year?
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:35:06
I'm sure - it's just not a very ambitious goal and if you have $2.5m in assets to deliver that passive income you could do much more.

As a bitcoin newb, would the corporation (BitGo) basically sit on the loss themselves (with the lost bitcoins forever being lost) or would they somehow know where these coins ended up and just reimburse you before finding them?
I ask because I moved countries once, and my salary was accidentally lost in the regular banking system. The bank knew that the money had been sent to my account, they knew how much, they knew it was lost, but they were not willing to credit the funds until the message was "found". Given the stress of moving country I never forgave them for that bullshit.

The use-case here is the instance where a Bank of America customer wishes to send e.g. Euros to a non-BoA customer. In such a situation then BoA do not trust the recipient bank, and vice-versa. If both of us have a BoA account and you wish to send me money, the system should not require this technology as it's only BoA moving numbers in an internal ledger that ought to be totally transparent.
Not all banks are fully integrated (in terms of their local and overseas operations). I recall trying to set up a new HSBC account when moving overseas - I set up the account in my home country specifically because they're "the worlds local bank", yet when I arrived in the destination I was told they couldn't simply "move money from my home account to my new account" because they essentially operate like two entirely separate banks. If only I'd known about bitcoin at that time and been able to move my funds, I wouldn't have been stuck waiting for wire transfers to clear desperately hoping my cash would arrive quickly enough to make rent.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that the coins will only become recoverable from the old addresses. Assume someone hacks and steals 1 million BTC from Satoshi, moves them to a newer (uncrackable) address, then loses the private keys to the new address - this then loses the bitcoins for good. 
I guess what I'm saying is that the currency remains deflationary in the long term, only that known insecure coins may be brought out of "dormancy" and into the spendable Bitcoin population (from where they can be lost) - as opposed to them sitting there waiting for Satoshi to potentially spend them.
What am I missing?

Thanks, that makes sense. I don't use Coinbase so didn't know about the insurance policy etc. I'm not entirely sure this is the biggest thing for Bitcoin though - doesn't seem to help adoption unless they put a Bitcoin symbol on the front of the card and others think it's worth adopting.

People selling bitcoins are asking for more money for each one too.

Sorry if this sounds dumb - but why move money/coins off exchange during a rally like this? I intend to sell into this to bank some profit.

How is this beneficial to bitcoin, and why would I want it vs just having a bank debit card that does the same thing? (assuming I have to trust these guys by depositing bitcoins with them, why would I do so over depositing them at a bank with a govt backed insurance scheme?)

It wasn't an accident on the part of Gemini though, but by one of their customers. If you're a stupid ass and buy something worth $350 for $2200 from me then it's your fault, not the exchange on which we completed the transaction and certainly not mine for offering an above market value coin to an idiot who didn't know how to trade.

Sure thing mate - itbit. I'm looking into moving the coins now and don't think I've been a douche about this. Replies to my post suggest it's easier than I thought, but every time I read this sub I find someone suggesting I need military grade encryption for my coins. 
For what it's worth I've got a meaningful sum of money on there but if I lose it I'm not going to end up going hungry.

Yes, that would be ideal but the back order on both ledger and trezor at the moment means I wouldn't get it in time.

Don't forget to ask him to send an example of the type of info he is asking for, ideally from his own wallet. And if he does, drain the fucking lot.

They'll get transferred to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and get praised for eliminating Malaria globally, before all the attention created sends Bitcoin past the Moon and on to Mars.

I'm too lazy to move mine into cold storage and deal with that bollocks. When bitcoin becomes easy to safely store then maybe we'll have our moon shot. Beforehand it's too complex even for someone vaguely tech savvy like me and therefore people like my parents and grandparents are fucked if they want to get involved.

Yeah, I was toying with leaving a mining rig in the office of my last company as I doubt anyone would have checked for it, and the power/internet bill would have been free. Decided it wasn't worth it in the end.

The point here is that BTC is a currency, but currencies only trade in pairs (no use knowing that BTC has increased in value without a measure of what it increased its value against). As such you look at the "price" of BTC in terms of another currency - most likely the dollar for people on here, but those in China would view it against RMB unless they were planning on leaving China. I bought mine using SGD, so I view the BTC/SGD currency pair. When the price of BTC rises vs SGD I "cash out" at the point when I think the rise is almost done - "locking in" some profits in a currency that I can pay my rent in, buy food at the supermarket with, use for my phone bills or buy myself a copy of the local paper. 
Once BTC becomes universal enough to be an acceptable payment mechanism for all of those things I might stop "cashing out", but realistically it won't do that and there will always be some kind of sovereign currency in any country that will be the main chunk of your spending requirements that you'd need to cash out to.

What happens if I lose the phone/upgrade to the latest iOS? Is the process of keeping those 12 random words the method that would protect the BTC?
I have a relatively large amount of BTC that I'd be transferring from iTbit so am cautious about sending them to a phone.

Presumably this holds true for coins held on an exchange too? I've got coins on ItBit so if I ride them through the August 1st date they'll end up on whatever the "winning" chain is, if I read you correctly.
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:39:47
Fair point. I presume I'm hostage to whatever they decide to do with those bitcoins unless I withdraw to an offline wallet?
