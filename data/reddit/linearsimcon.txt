What would you rather have, a currency that is controlled by the leftist regime where they can seize all your assets at a whim... Or a decentralized currency that while volatile, offers at least some protection against government seizures... Not to mention that the government can destroy and screw it's own currency by printing more of it , but it can't do the same to bitcoin.
Advice regarding the Greek to invest in bitcoin is simply due to the fact that it's safer that way than whatever currency is in the government hands...

In Greece it seems the options are limited to say the least, having atleast somewhat diversified alternatives can only be good. None should have only Euro in cash or bitcoin, but I believe having both can be a good health safety barrier towards government oppression.

Since you deleted the other comment, here is the response I wrote for that one:
Now why should they be banned or regulated, and who do you propose should enforce such a ban? Is it not so that people who currently use those substances would remain a criminal in accordance with what you are proposing? If not, then why does there need to be a ban, the people using those substances are going to use it anyway through any means. Enforcing a ban just leads to criminal networks (not the government in this instance) gets control over the trade due to risks associated with the trade due to the ban. The result is instead that the person who use the substance is left no choice but to buy it from the criminals.
I'm not saying that some substances aren't dangerous for people, but what I'm saying is that bans and making them illegal isn't solving anything. And that's not even considering the moral aspect of why someone else should decide what you are allowed to do with your body or life.
In regards to the comment you wrote just now, how would such regulation be enforced? Through the monopoly of violence if people aren't cooperating? Just look how well it's going today...

Correctly installed fire safety equipment doesn't need to be expensive in relationship to the potential risks and damages.
Concrete walls, gas extinguishing system (Carbon dioxide, 
liquified compressed), throw in a message giving anyone 30 seconds or so to leave the room where a fire is detected with an air sampling detection system (aspirating smoke detector) using laser (instead of an optical detector) for fast detection. Some care taken with ventilation system and cooling to ensure avoidance of fire spread, but with that you would be pretty much set. More or less, I only have a general expertise and knowledge on the area and haven't actually worked on a server hall so I can't say if that would be the most optimal solution.
Hiring an expert to ensure that it's done and sized properly doesn't need to be that expensive, and definitively worth it given risks involved. But just hiring a company who are selling one certain product, that isn't something I'd recommend. They would size their product and adapt it to the risks at hand which doesn't need to be a good or optimal solution.

As someone has said before, you can arrest the current team, but what would happen? Anonymous developers would take their place and it would continue development underground.

They can still create a cryptocurrency of their own and start competing with bitcoin if they so chooses. Backed by paypal and all vendors that already accept transactions through paypal, that would get a rather widespread (theoretical) adoption rate rather quickly.

But then again... why not adapt bitcoin?

That really depends on what you considers to be more likely, the government inflating the currency faster, or slower, than the rate at which bitcoin increase in value, if you believe it will increase.
I for one believe the mother of all crashes will come sooner, or later. Who knows what will happen then.

If you want it to be noticed you should go after some the bigger subreddits and threads with decent people. Say that OP in saved a cat and has paid huge amount in veterinarian costs. If someone then where to actually give a somewhat substantial amount (vague terms) of money through changetip then that could actually make a difference and get some very good and positive attention. So I'd say that if you want to get attention in bigger subreddits I *think* a few larger tips would be better than multiple small ones.
But I'm not sure, I guess it depends on the amount of votes a donation might get and attention that would come out of it. If you'd get a few hundreds upvotes with people asking questions, then that would be way more beneficial than multiple small ones that goes unnoticed. Guess there's only one real way to find out, darn, I wish I was a bitcoin millionaire so I could conduct this test myself.

I'd say the adoption rate is positive and as such what you can use bitcoins for, while the exchange value between dollar and bitcoin has been less so. Overall, much more positive than negative.

The store where I often buy my tea has a system where you for every tenth purchase can get one for free, pretty decent loyalty offer and since I'm cheap (I like to save money) I thus proceeds to get expensive tea with that discount. Best off all would have been if I could have ordered tea from the UK, but it seems at least amazon has some weird shipping restrictions on tea and coffee (If someone knows a good site, I'm all ears).
Not sure what that has to do with this guys profit margins, but something about the local bakery and token system got me going.

The value of faces regarding business goes as far as their reputation, if they have nothing from the beginning then they don't have much to loose when they gamble. If it's someone that is well-known and has built up a reputation over time, then his reputation is worth more and there's more to loose.
Having a face on an organization is just worth as much as the persons reputation, and an unknown person doesn't really add any credibility...

It's a well produced trailer and I believe there should be enough of an interest to get it funded if you just can reach the right groups and people with a campaign. But then again I have no idea how your campaign was, or what the funding goal was. You wrote local crowdfund? Why not global? You need to reach the right people and you're more likely to find them if you are trying to reach out to a global audience. The language for the production itself didn't seem to be too much of an issue even if it's Hebrew (I assume), but the material surrounding it at least has to be in English.

You do not think it would be bad business for the internet provider to throttle a competitor that the user wants? If there's no regulation there are room for competitors to enter the market if the user isn't satisfied with the service the provider is offering, because who is the customer? Netflix, or the user? Would the internet provider be of any use to netflix, if he doesn't provide service to the user, would he hold any value if the user were to switch service provider? It's simply not in a business interest to act against the interest of the costumer and user if the costumer simply can change internet provider.
Also the internet, and the bandwidth which it is based upon, is a scarce resource. It is not unlimited. Not having the ability of offering certain services that require so priority would be silly. Not all traffic does hold the same value, for some it can be much more important to get their service through during peek-trafic, than for others. Forcing everyone to pay for something they don't require or use would simply force up the price for everyone.
Regarding the constitution, it's a piece of paper trying to regulate the government by letting the government interpret the rules which is supposed to limit it. Just check what's in place today... I definitely believe a company that wants to keep you as a costumer, and risk loosing you if the service provided is unsatisfactory, will provide a better service than a government which has no such qualms as you can't just switch provider of services, can you? Do you want to argue that the first amendment wasn't restricted during the red scare when the espionage act was imposed?
Regarding your first statement, what do you have in mind there? What is this system of checks and balances your are talking about? This filibuster Rand is having is against the patriot act and all that power it grants the government. Where are those checks you are talking about? What stance is it really you are trying to argue that is being overlooked?
And you also mentioned a party having "unnecessary power." what do you have in mind there, what are you thinking of? The government? Also the amount of information comcast are supposed to have access to regarding my internet usage and such could be regulated in a contract between me and comcast, if the terms offered aren't satisfactory regarding my individual privacy, I can always choose another provider. Because why is it that this issue with monopoly providers started in the first place? Government regulation. Thus trying to fix the first issue caused by the government, with even more regulation, that isn't a good solution.

Yes and no, would it stop even if he didn't do it himself? If no, then damage control can definitely be justified. You can be against something and still be forced to use it if it's the only way. Then again, in a sense that might make him a hypocrite depending on the perspective.

I'm not saying it isn't a good thing taking a stance against it, but this question getting publicity is also very beneficial as in regards to his run for President.
It's a good solid PR move, for himself, and also against the patriot act. This since it Technically won't be a filibuster unless he speaks all through the night and delays the voting (if he does, mad respects). 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:13:35

I would not equate Ron Paul, with Rand Paul, in regards as the two as politicians. Ron Paul didn't really play the game, Rand Paul is playing the game trying to win, with whatever means required. As such Rand Paul sure enough has been compromising and making a lot of questionable moves. In the end? Who knows.

Money isn't everything, but it's a means to more comfortable lives and a means to trade goods between people. Money might not be everything, but it sure is a means to a better life. Not to mention that money and the free market is the most efficient way as to allocating resources, central planning will never work as long as the world consists of individuals with different preferences. Also you mentioned a collective conscious? I prefer to continue existing as an individual, thank you very much.

Does he claim to be a libertarian, he removed the reading list that he used to have on his website (and that [list was libertarian]( If he is, or isn't, I really don't know. Some have hope that he would turn out to be what they imagine if he would be elected, that he's just a libertarian in disguise... Well I don't hold that kind of hope regarding him, but I still believe it can be fun to follow if he will have any progress and success. Because unlike some, I really do not like the thought of Hilary Clinton as the president of the united states...

Both Transmission and qBittorrent are good, qBittorrent just feels and looks the same as utorrent thus making for a smooth transition if one previously was used to utorrent.
Also worth a mention would be Deluge which is solid. But which to use among qBittorrent, Deluge or Transmission is more a matter of previous experience, preference with interface and if one is looking for some specific feature. There's probably more out there, but it's the three that I've been alternating between the last years.
