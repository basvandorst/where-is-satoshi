In my country this would be illegal. All minerals belong to the crown, even on private land.
I assume you live in the USA, so it is not owned by the crown. However the US Federal government owns approximately 57.2 million acres of subsurface mineral rights in the USA. This means that if you own private property in America, there's a fair chance you do not own or have a right to sell the minerals underneath your property.
So, bad example.
Not that your example is relevant to what I'm talking about anyway. I'm talking about people scabbing electricity from other unwitting entities. 
For instance suppose you have a landlord who has agreed to pay your utilities for some reason in exchange for a flat rent fee. Now you can use all the electricity you want, whilst you only have to pay a flat fee for your rent - thus ripping off your poor landlord who never expected you to run a mini nuclear plant in your apartment, to which you claim to us as 'free electricity'.
By 'free money' I do not make it explicit in my post, but I am referring to the act of mining Bitcoins on a CPU in 2010 say for peanuts in both time, effort and money - and then selling them to some unwitting fool in 2013/2014 with money in his eyes believing the shills who tell him 'BUY NOW BEFORE IT REACHES $5 QUINTILLION++ YOU'LL BE A MILLIONARE IN 24 HOURS!!!!". I am therefore in agreement with you when you say that is a person is entitled to that which he works for, but I disagree with you that I am saying something against that.

Article is three months old, and the article doesn't mention the fact that the vast majority of mining machines are operating at a loss - with the remaining half a dozen or so barely managing to break even.
EDIT: Even if you can get access to 'free electricity' (note: electricity isn't really free), the best mining machine will pay itself off after 151 days. The second best is 265 days. Both of these are still 'preorder' and have not been delivered yet. All the others are a year or more just to break even on free electricity.

True, I was around in those days myself - however a GPU as you note had resell value because it has more purpose than just Bitcoin mining - a specialized Bitcoin miner today on the other hand becomes worthless once it can no longer be used for Bitcoin mining.
Some people did go out and buy AMD cards and put them in crossfire, but I think a lot of people - at least in early 2011 - used the card they used for gaming to also mine Bitcoins casually.
I think if you had the right card, you could mine Bitcoins at a small profit. I remember having a HD5770, and I think from memory the profit after subtracting electricity costs was $0.50/day. And there were better cards than mine.
Plus another factor you have to consider is that back in those days, getting Bitcoins was difficult - especially if you lived outside the US. MtGox was pretty much the only exchange. So mining was really one of the only ways of getting Bitcoin.

And what is the evidence this book of yours cites to back up this claim?
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:18:37


You say that like humans are all well-informed, entirely rational individuals.
I'm quite sure most landlords have never even heard about Bitcoin, let alone factored it into their 'calculation'.


Wrong. Say I have a text file on my desktop containing a few paragraphs of information written by me. It's likely the only one of it's kind in the world, and yet it has no price.
But let's take your analogy - could you not apply it tulips? Do you see where I'm going with this? You would make my own argument for me. If you want to compare Bitcoin with tulips, then please, go ahead and tell it to everyone else here.
However, do not claim that I have no right to judge the intrinsic value of an object, whether it be in my own possession or in the possession of another. Indeed, is it not the case that we value the object in question *before* we purchase it?
The intrinsic value of a Bitcoin as you yourself say, may only only be that of a few CPU cycles. Why then should I not state that this is the case, and that a person who spent their years down in the mines only to blow their hard-earned retirement money on a few of these 'Bitcoins' is getting fleeced? 
It is not as though Bitcoins have any attributes in and of themselves that make attractive or collectable - they're not akin to a painting or an antique which has aesthetic or sentimental value which can far outweigh the effort that went into producing it.

I don't need to ask them, I can already see why.
They continue operating at a loss because they have no other option. They've already paid the $10K or so for their miner, and it's worthless outside of Bitcoin mining. So even if they're just making $2 a week with no hope of ever breaking even, they continue to do so, because $2 is better than $0.
If the price falls though, even these existing miners will turn their machines off as electricity costs become higher than revenue.
My point here though is that no one will want to buy the next generation of miners. No one is going to buy knowing they're going to make a net loss. Or perhaps the companies which produce the mining machines might stop making them, knowing few will buy them.


Again, how attractive is mining a 25BTC block, if a Bitcoin is priced at $0.01? If the network becomes slow and vulnerable, it's not going to make everyone bullish about Bitcoin. They're going to sell, and the price would plummet.


Do you believe there are hard physical limitations to the exponential growth of processing capability, or do you believe that there are no hard physical limitations?

I don't care about your price speculation
In any case, it wouldn't make a difference - not even if the price doubled in just 6 months from now.
I explain why in this post:
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:24:01
I'm making the point that every Bitcoin miner is losing money. Don't know what you're on about.
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:35:30
You don't think it wouldn't happen?
The thing about a drop in hash rate with a long time to a difficulty retarget is that it makes it even more unprofitable for the miners who choose to remain and stay mining for those 2-3 months at a loss. Common sense would dictate that you stop mining at that stage, and just wait for the difficulty retarget.
Most miners I daresay are motivated out of profit, not out of their love for Bitcoin. So, I'd guess that if any substantial hash rate drop did occur, you'd see a lot more than just 80% of miners stop mining.
And what would happen to the Bitcoin users in that time? What would happen to transaction times and fees?
Most importantly, what would happen to the price, and how would that affect the revenue of the miners who choose to remain?
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:26:13
It's actually far below break even at present. Even the latest miners available calculate a loss in the amounts of thousands of dollars.
If the price falls even further, which it looks almost certain it will, then it's going to be even worse.
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:27:17


Why would they want to if they're operating at a loss?
A lower network hashrate does not mean you make more profit. If the price of Bitcoin falls with the hashrate, as you would expect it to, then what would be the point of mining 25BTC blcks regularly - if the price of a Bitcoin was $0.01?
The big threat a sudden decrease in network hash rate poses is that the network would come to a virtual standstill. Block retargeting only happens once every 2016 blocks - and if a 10 minute block becomes a 10 hour block, well, you do the math..


But with *all* miners (even pre-order models) unable to break even, let alone churn a profit, who will buy the new ones? And without buyers, who will create them?
I also don't believe that we will be seeing huge leaps in the future as we have in the past (i.e. from CPU to GPU to specialized hardware).
ASICs designed for Bitcoin are already down to 28nm. Intel is currently at 22nm. Sooner or later, the hard limitations of physics are going to reached in this area.
Just to put it in perspective, a 4nm transistor can be made out of 7 atoms. How much do you think that can be improved upon - at least in the next decade?
It's a common misconception amongst Bitcoiners it seems to me that they believe that technology will continue to develop exponentially. Not only is there no guarantee of that, but it's looking like that isn't going to be the case at all. In fact it's already been slowing down over the past few years.
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:47:05
What happens when the price doesn't increase and current miners end their lifespan of generating revenue?
Answer: The network hashrate decreases greatly, both jeopardizing the security of the network and potentially causing the network to freeze in time with no blocks being mined/transactions not getting through. Because if the network hashrate suddenly decreases, then blocks take a lot longer to mine - and block re-targeting doesn't happen for 2016 blocks!

Do you even understand the difference between SHA-256 and scrypt?
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:58:25


Which one?
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:52:56
What exactly is a 'V1 ASIC', do you have a link to the product description?
@_date: 2014-07-16 19:06:07


Hold on, you're contradicting yourself
You say 18 months here, but in another post you say you received them last October. Last October would make it 9 months.
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:03:04


That excites you does it?
Well how about this: I can make you break even in less than a day.
How? Simple - put your money in a savings account.
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:23:07
What reason is there to suggest the price will increase? Speculation?
In fact the price is likely to go down further - much further.
The fact is that miners are operating at a loss.
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:55:00


So he didn't actually 'make bank *with multipool*' as you describe?
You just dug a hole for yourself bud, and now everyone else can see it
Also, I'm talking about BITCOIN MINERS, not ALTCOIN MINERS - get it through your thick head you stupid shill
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:57:44
What miner(s) are you using?
So others and I can verify your claim
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:38:36
Disregard my previous erroneous response
You were probably lucky enough to net a few grand if you started mining in October just as the bubble began
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:10:35


Well otherwise it would be like saying 'Johnny was happy because he failed his test'. It simply doesn't make sense - why would the price increase if the network hash rate is decreasing, slowing down the network, making it more vulnerable to attack, and raising questions over the viability of it's future?


Higher payouts of BTC, not payouts of dollars. Imagine mining 25BTC blocks on a regular basis, but a Bitcoin only being worth $0.01. Not so attractive now is it.
EDIT: Actually I got it wrong here. Even the BTC payout would be high, the high difficulty prior to the retarget would mean that you'd have to mine for a long time - so it's not a higher payout at all when you add time into the equation.


Not if the price of Bitcoin falls they won't
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:42:17


What if a higher price doesn't come? And by the time that higher price comes, it'll probably be far too late anyway. 
For instance, say the price doubles in 6 months time.
In 6 months time the difficulty have increased to the point that even with a doubling of their revenue, they'll only be making at most $40 a week - with a negative balance of thousands of dollars left just to break even.


BTW for anyone reading this and unfamiliar with mining and/or multipool, I'll explain why this is both stupid and a lie.
Bitcoin miners can only do the SHA-256 algorithm. Most altcoins are Scrypt algorithm, not SHA-256. That is why altcoins are generally much more profitable than Bitcoin.
Multipool automatically mines the most profitable coin. If you go to their site, on the front page you'll see a list of the currently most profitable coins, and there's one box for scrypt and another box for SHA-256. Bitcoin is currently the most profitable SHA-256 coin. 
So this claim of a 'friend making bank with multipool' is outright bullshit, since every Bitcoin miner is making a loss, even though it is the most profitable SHA-256 coin.
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:51:43


A drop in network hash rate and a drop in price go hand-in-hand, whereas a drop in network hash rate and an increase in price do not.
I think it's fair to say increased network vulnerability and slower network transaction times will decrease confidence in Bitcoin, not increase it.


No, but I would like to know what information you have access to that I don't that makes you so sure that computational capability will increase exponentially over the next few years/decades

'Free electricity' is usually used here to denote electricity from generators that can be scabbed free-of-charge through some underhanded method.
You must be talking about solar panels I assume, which is not what I'm talking about. But if you did buy solar panels to power your miner - that in itself is a cost. And if you say 'well I have already have solar panels anyway, so it's free', that's probably not the case because at least where I'm from, you can feed back that electricity into the grid for $$$ - and at a far higher rate than electricity derived from non-renewables in fact.
