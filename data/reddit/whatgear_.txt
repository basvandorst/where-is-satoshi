would take 200k$ to push it back up to 1$ on kraken. I doubt they don't have that kind of money somewhere. Question is, why is next to nothing is done? Why they don't communicate more? Thats the main issue really, along with usdt being unpegged for more than a week.

it doesn't defeat the whole purpose of crypto, it's one of the many usages of the blockchain: everybody is trading crypto assets as a speculative investment to gain FIAT value (lets not lie to each others ;)), therefore the purpose of a stable coin is to escape any other asset at any time on any exchanges even those with no FIAT gateway, and to have a (supposed) risk free medium to transfer easily from an exchange to another without going back into the banking system. Its something really "crypto" for that matter isnt it? What's so hard to understand?

And what if there is a zombie apocalypse? Please be serious for a sec. You are way safer in dollar than in bitcoin. But you might miss opportunity to gain more dollar maybe, on a long enough timescale.

I think the main issue is that english isn't my native language then. But it isn't the main issue. The main issue is that you don't have any idea about what you are talking about and are just repeating the word you saw here all day like a monkey. Tether has slipped like that 3 time last year. It had spend way more time pegged than unpegged. And i think what you meant was "It's unproven that tether is actually BACKED BY anything", ok, but is it proven its not?

And let me get things straight for you, it looks like you think that the "purpose of crypto" is to be volatile. Crypto have only one purpose : using cryptography to create trust by bypassing 3rd party. And actually one of the only large scale mainstream adoption of the blockchain we could possibly have is a government issued open ledger currency pegged to it's official national counterpart. I truly think you are either a noob or a below average individual to have such a poor and immature view of the matter.
