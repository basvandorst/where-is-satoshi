According to Bloomberg the underground economy is just 10% of the market. The only article I could find indicates that drug dealers abandoned Bitcoin late 2017 because of cost and transaction times. Is there any other reason why Bitcoin hasnt been more widely adopted in money laundering ? Has the volatility &amp; transaction cost been the main deterrent ?

I was under the impression that Bitcoin had an intrinsic value in support of the underground economy, given the underground economy has not contracted Im left to theorize that the value no real floor.

Bitcoin at this point is more of private equity play: long holding period with the hope of 10x returns. The price could go to 0.1x  and may never hit today’s levels, but that is the nature of a private equity - large rewards with massive risk. Conversely all the chatter about prior crashes justifying today’s faith is misleading, Bitcoin will hit ATH when new participants enter the market, at this point volumes are declining and a fraction of 2017

Breaking it down into categories of institutional investors:
1) ETF providers - (Blackrock et al) cant
2) Long biased /long holding horizon mutual funds/managed pension funds - wont while the price slides (investor base unlikely to be interested anyway)
3) PE firms - small size/very bespoke holdings only (no track to justify large holding )
4) Hedge funds - Already involved mostly in arb / market making , fund commitments tend to be &lt; 100MM so generally small and opportunistic

For the committed holders, what short term (&lt; 3 month) events should people be aware of that will cause price appreciation ? If there are no price appreciating events why hold on a sustained slump ?
