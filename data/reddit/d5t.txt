Don't know what card this guy is using, but the cards like Centra work with a wallet. Then when you use the card it does the crypto -&gt; fiat conversion. Seriously, Centra is a step ahead of everyone right now, 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:00:47
This is why Centra went to mastercard and is ahead of literally everyone on that list right now. They are shipping prepaid mastercards as I type to a lot of ICO contributors. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:54:57
LMAO that sounds like a costco problem. Pay your $1.70 for a hot dog and drink in fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:44:19
Cool, but Centra is already a step ahead. This is old news by the way. I think today was the deadline or something for WaveCrest. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:58:53
Yes they are shipping and tons of initial contributors have them already and are posting videos. Their cards are issued by a bank using MasterCard.

LOL watching the  account transition to supporting bcash was so fucking obvious. He totally purchased the account. The switch-over from unbaised tweets to full blown attacking bitcoin was too quick to think otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:41:36
This is old news if you are following all the crypto cards out there. It has been known for months that WaveCrest fucked up and Visa would pull the plug on their issuance.

He's been donated tons of BTC the last few days to his address in addition to Patreon. Patreon doesn't support bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:08:31
Dude you're jumping to wild conclusions. This guy is genuine if you have followed him over the last few years. Roger Ver is the absolute opposite of that and his comment further classifies him as a grade a asshole we all knew he was.
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:37:53
You gotta re-watch it all! There's an entire underlying side story about cryptocurrency wars: bitcoin vs. ecoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:56:28
About 1500. [
@_date: 2019-03-25 20:32:31
Disagree. It was the most unique content r/bitcoin has had in a while. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 20:53:10
You have your seed written down. Hopefully. is correct, any BIP39 wallet will work
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:57:32
Where? They don't have any physical stores.
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:02:05
You mean re-exist in the US. The brand lives in in Tokyo atleast.
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:58:32
Your $btc is on the blockchain. You have your private key stored separately I assume. You can literally use any other BTC wallet.
@_date: 2018-06-22 00:34:52
They're all unstable. Coinbase and Gemini are the only two exchanges I'd trust when buying crypto with Fiat transfers in the US, depsite all the bad customer support. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 16:32:48
Yeah let's not compare crypto to newspapers. Crypto is the disruptive technology.
Papers got disrupted by the internet. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 04:01:56
Also likely this was a exit scam and all that btc will be dumped on exchanges. But Twitter experts, man. Can't go against them
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:38:57
99.95% of your post.
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:23:09
You're making lots of assumptions with random numbers you're making up out of thin air. I'd agree more with you if you're argument was about blockchain transaction needing UX improvements  vs. needing a trusted 3rd party. We don't need a entity in the middle policing our money and using it to their advantage.
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:49:48
Exactly! Everyone knows adoption is low. You don't need to make numbers up.
@_date: 2019-04-28 13:59:48
You're missing the point of bitcoin. Blockchain transactions are supposed to be immutable. There's no trusted party in the middle. And we're using "trusted" lightly. So you're going to have to suck it up and make sure you're taking extra precautions, turning on all security features, when making transactions.
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:01:49
AKA you bought at a near high. 
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:30:11
You use your phone to pay for crypto. Weird option to have. Should have been Apple Pay / Google Pay with bank card
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:09:57
What do you distrust about it? Because it's still in price discovery? It'll get there. Look long term. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 03:08:37
Outright dismissing them is dumb. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:04:42
Having multiple options to increase bitcoin liquidity is dumb. /s
Let the market decide and who cares about the fees (the market will also decide that)? If you're savvy enough to register, do KYC, and buy through an exchange, and transfer to a wallet you aren't these kiosk's target audience.

Tether.... is tethered to USD's value. Which slightly fluctuates, but is stable. Tether really isn't a crypto, it's trying to be USD in disguise. No one is investing in tether hoping it increases in price; people are going into tether to short price drops of other coins.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:38:39
Did you read the article? If you had an invite to  the Spedn app and sent BTC to its wallet, you'd be able to scan and pay with BTC. Don't go asking retail employees who have enough hard time understanding NFC payments about bitcoin. What were you expecting?
@_date: 2018-12-01 06:11:56
Me personally 20+ years, if you're looking at Bitcoin as a currency. We need to see how by handles a global recession like 2008.
