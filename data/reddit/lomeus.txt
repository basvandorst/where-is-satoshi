Long term, as just holding the coins, not doing any trading with them.

I live in Norway, never heard of Circle closing accounts due to user locations? :O
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:43:56
In what way to you recommend becoming my own bank then? 
The reason for using Circle is that I found them very professional, had a Nice layout on both Android and browser alike. Do you have anything similar?

Works like a charm!

I contacted their support a few hours ago, so I guess I have to be a little more patient. 
That is correct, I do not have an US bank account. But I can't remember reading about this being an issue in the user agreement?

I have emailed their support, and message them on their help center. But still no answer on either platform.

I got an answer from Circle, and my account has been restored. But it looks like they just closed the Whole thing as a mistake, and without giving me and notice.

and they were nice enough to give me $25 gift for my troubles. 
But might be looking to find myself a new and better wallet in the very near future!

With a mining pool fee of 2%, we will get 3.7 BTC per month with 12 Th/s. This will go fall with a few % every difficulty change.

Ah, them bits &lt;3 Using bits instead of bitcoin makes it so much easier, seeing how much one bitcoin is worth. 
Should add  
And maybe wikileaks ^^ ?

With all the bitcoin mining profitability calculators out there it all comes out too being better buying mining gear for 16.3 BTC, then buying btc for the same amount. 2x AM-6000 is exactly 16.3 BTC. 
We will break even in 5 months of mining on a decent pool at 12 Th/s, and get approximately 86% profit. That amounts to at least 14 bitcoins. But we haven't decided anything yet, and are still calculating everything from purchase of more bitcoins then we may allready have to getting mining hardware. If the difficulty continues to go up about the same percentage we will still make money after 2 years (even tho it's scaled down dramaticlly).
