Wow, I can't even...

If they're chained (unconfirmed txo used in new tx), same coins can be counted multiple times. I think this is a better estimation: 125k

I got this too, it came to slack specific email address. Damn you Slack, for publishing email addresses!

And a google cache version from 28.7.2016:

Does any other exchange give out their private key?

Yesterday I bought a book on Amazon for $9, now I found it on ebook.farm for $0.47 :) I think I'll be reading much more this year. Thanks!

Yeah, right!

It only blocks tracking from known domains, it doesn't block javascript in general. Additionally, if you're target of a phishing attack, attackers don't even need to use javascript, just a visually similar landing page.

Can you provide a source for this? The only problem I know about is caused by random number not being random. If it is random, there should be no way to interpolate anything.

A security precaution I make, is to git clone the repository, then checkout a commit that is couple of months old. I figure, if it was malicious in any way, somebody would notice and make it public by then.

Not exactly what you want, but might be useful. You could create a password protected paper wallet and bury copies of it in remote locations or give to friends for safekeeping (or both).

I know how it feels. It made using VPN too much of a hassle for me.

Copay to BitPay is like Chromium to Chrome. The core is the same, but BitPay wallet has some extra integrations with their partners to enable easy buying/selling bitcoins, for example.

As long as there is no arbitrage. If there's an arbitrage, both parties need to provide their IDs.

It's the first physical bitcoin incarnation, started in May 2011 and discontinued a year later.

Sorry, but this is wrong. If A trusts B, then A trust B, nothing else. Even if C creates a payment which ripples through B and A, the result will be that C owes B and B owes A (there is no C owes A!).

I was sure I had it at 1.5x and had to check... nope, 1.0x

Same here, at least nothing new recently. It's not impossible though, they were hacked in 2015 and I remember them having some problems with email provider too.

What are the timestamps of those two transactions? Can you remember what you were doing then?

But it did. There is a code that went through a list of accounts and moved all ether to another account (refund)
    // Move every DAO account and extra-balance account funds into the refund contract
    for _, addr := range params.DAODrainList {
        if account := statedb.GetStateObject(addr); account != nil {
            refund.AddBalance(account.Balance())
            account.SetBalance(new(big.Int))
        }
    }
