The energy figures are way, way off from what current and recent hardware consumes.  No way Bitcoin mining is consuming as much power as the article says irl.

The interviewers have their own editorially-driven agenda which is plain to see.  
I agree, this congressman knows what he is talking about on this subject.  
I wonder if anyone has started compiling a list of Bitcoin-friendly and Bitcoin-hostile politicians at any point.  In the future, this is going to be an increasingly important political issue.  If there was a report card type product that could inform voters, that would be really helpful for both voters and politicians.  For me personally, Bitcoin is one issue I would certainly cross political lines for.

A big chunk of the flow into negative yielding debt is as a shorter term trade, not with the desire to hold until maturity- ie the expectation that rates will go lower/prices higher.  And/or you will be able to unload the asset at par or better during the next round of QE.   The expectation is that high quality debt will hold value better during the next flight to safety (which appears to be right around the corner).
Either way, I agree, Bitcoin disrupts this phenomenon.  And if some people running for the exits head to Bitcoin instead, they're going to do a lot better in the long run.

I kind of understood it and played around with it for a while before it "clicked."  I thought it might be a moonshot you could get lucky on if it caught on.
It clicked for me as far as becoming a true believer when I took an online Princeton course on Bitcoin and got a better grasp of the technical concepts.  At that point it seemed less like a long shot and more like an inevitability.

Not necessarily.  If they are buying shares in something that is supposed to track Bitcoin price but is cash-settled, it may not.
@_date: 2019-07-20 03:05:49
I understand what you're saying but disagree.  50x Leverage in a FOREX market that is barely moving in percentage terms is different compared to Bitcoin that routinely sees nearly instant 10+% moves and has limited liquidity.
You can argue that people getting rekt is the risk they take trading with leverage in that type of market, but it's an invitation for big and/or connected players to basically print money by liquidating people at disadvantage.  
I view this is move as investor protection akin to trying to enforce insider trading laws, not an attempt for Wall Street to gain centralized control of Americans' Bitcoin trading.

I don't quite get the question.  That's not really the binary choice.
With leverage: You can get 10x,100x or whatever gains, but have to hope that price doesn't move against you, which is a very high probability with a volatile asset, or you can lose your whole position.
If you just buy the asset: You get 1x gains, and hope the price doesn't go to zero, which is a very low probability outcome.  And if price drops, you at least can recoup part of your investment.
And like the other commenter mentions, when positions start getting really overleveraged long or short, it also creates opportunities for people like whales to come in and essentially get free money/Bitcoin by liquidating people out of their positions.
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:04:53
This much negative yielding debt is scary as hell.  Is there any precedent for this in history?  I don't think so.
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:35:36
I'd assume the case where it would be recovered is if someone has coins on an exchange and they die with no heirs indicated, abandon the exchange for a long period of time, or are sanctioned to have their assets seized.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:40
I'm an outsider, but the rise in BCash looked like insider trading ahead of the surprise move to list it on Coinbase.  Trading looks like it opened briefly on GDAX but then stopped pretty much right away at a ridiculous price due to a lack of liquidity.  I don't know what is going to happen when they reopen trading, but looks like a lot of people trying to sell as soon as they can.
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:56:49
Price doesn't track according to that type of model.  ie 25x as many people investing will not result in a 25x price rise, even assuming they all invest equally.  Same thing as far as people increasing their investment to 4x the current average amount.
For example, if 25x the people are trying to enter the market, but people selling Bitcoin are unwilling to part with it, it could rise much more than that.  Conversely, if people selling Bitcoin want a quick profit, or want out of Bitcoin for some reason, prices could rise much less than 25x or even drop.
That being said, I think $1 M and beyond is perfectly realistic down the road.

Try to understand they are on an agenda, a lot of them paid.   The ones that are paid get explicit talking points, like why insider trading isn't bad, bitcoin tx fees, censorship, claiming any dissent is an "attack", the true vision of Satoshi, etc.  The ones that aren't paid are brought in line by appeal to authority, brigading, or just being brainwashed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:30:54
Yeah, I get your point, well said.  I'm not trying to say it will kill the space.  But I believe it will discourage adoption and recovery in the same way the large and visible Mt Gox collapse shook confidence in the market for a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:41:24
Yeah I've been in for a while too, these last several months, seems like price has gotten way ahead of where the tech is in terms of scaling.  There are a lot of expectations of more mainstream adoption as more traditional financial institutions start flowing more, broader money into the space.  Unfortunately, this disconnect is the perfect attack surface for people trying to subvert Bitcoin, and I don't think it will go away any time soon.
For what it's worth, I'd say scaling correctly is more important than scaling quickly.  And lots of coins would see similar challenges as adoption picks up.  Trailblazing isn't easy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:48:22
It may not.  And not because BCash is a good coin.
There is a coordinated information ecosystem around that coin with deep pockets supporting it.  Even if it never gets past being a pump and dump coin, it's likely to persist, since the core insiders on that ecosystem can make a profit from it.

Mining centralization is separate from centralization due to needing more powerful computers with more memory space to run a full node.  Bitcoin could also use a change to the mining algorithm, but that's a separate issue from the big block drawback.

Wow, the surprise Coinbase move to add Bcash was all a part of this.  Pretty impressive amount of coordination had to go into this attack.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:23:01
To anyone that finds this line of argument compelling:
That's obviously not what's happening here.  There are plenty of coins that have advantages over Bitcoin in terms of transaction bandwidth, mining strategy, privacy, programmability, etc, that are much better than BCash.

I'm curious if there will be any repercussions for this kind of thing.  It was so brazen. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:37
I don't know what the regulatory response will be, if any.  There's kind of a sentiment right now that this is full caveat emptor, with no safety nets.
Makes me sad that Coinbase did this.  They've got their history of actions I haven't agreed with, but this is way over the line.  They must be making a lot of money with all the new customers they've been signing up left and right, there's no reason to take this kind of crazy action.  
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:14:34
I kind of think you have to be crazy to use leverage in this market.  People use it in FOREX a lot because you're looking at such small % moves.  Crypto is so volatile, just buying/selling with no leverage can get you rich or rekt so fast on its own.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:50:30
This was a contentious fork.  They're going to employ every trick at their disposal- shills, sock puppets, social media and information campaigns on regular media that aren't savvy enough to discern a Bitcoin skeptic from a BCash salesman, network attacks, you name it.  The insider trading on Coinbase was a new vector though.  Feel good that at least you're on the right side of this.  When the argument started on what scaling solution should be pursued, I wasn't able to make a good judgment based on the technical merits alone, so it was hard to see who was actually conflicted and who was making good arguments.  Their actions have made it clear.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:51:24
It's a hostile fork using multiple angles to try to take over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:52:41
Ripple is centralized by design, and a bunch of stuff can happen like transactions can be overruled, new tokens issued, etc, that make it bad for use as universal cash, but good as use for interbank settlement/transfer.
Bitcoin Cash is not a better play for security/store of value either, it is also going the other way.  However it is much worse than other alternatives like Litecoin for the purpose of fast transactions/low fees.  On chain scaling via blocksize increases is only a band aid fix and the bigger blocks get, the more system requirements will be required to run a node on the network, leading to centralization as well.
Off chain scaling should provide both fast, low fee transactions, and retain the decentralized nature of the main chain for trust purposes.

This may be a good dip to pick up a bit more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:50:06
I'd nuance it slightly differently.  I'd say larger blocksizes as an interim solution while a more permanent/better second layer solution is in progress makes a lot of sense.
However, I feel like the bad actors in the BCash camp have turned this largely into a political consideration, which has damaged the decision-making process.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:17
Yup, absolutely obvious insider action.  I don't know if there will be any repercussions though.  This seems to be the wild wild west.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:22:37
They are a pretty different use case.  Ripple is under centralized control, and is designed primarily for settlement.  It's competing more with SWIFT than with Bitcoin.  The token is separate from the network, and most of the tokens are held in escrow, and it's an inflationary token.  I think it's valuation is way too high at the moment, but these coins are all crazy, so who knows how much higher it can go.  I can see it passing Bitcoin market cap, but not really effecting the Bitcoin use case.  If that happens, I think it would cause a lot of issues with peoples' narratives, even though both should be able to exist side by side.

I don't think it will go away for a while.  There's still money to be made from pump and dump cycles in BCash.  I think they've spent their best bullets on this one though.  Maybe if the Bitfinex/Tether allegations go somewhere there could be another big one.

This is something I am struggling with lately too- explaining what's going on to people who are interested in Bitcoin.  There's so much bad information out there, it's too steep of a learning curve for newcomers.  Honestly, I'm having trouble putting together a credible message sometimes, because the longer it takes to explain why things are the way they are, the harder it is for someone to understand it.  Especially when there's a very simple counternarrative of "it's a bubble, stay away."

It's not really about bitcoin vs fiat.  It's about whether mtgox is insolvent and you won't be able to withdraw.
Makes perfect sense to me.  If the exchange goes belly up, you lose it all.  Higher probability of that means higher spreads vs other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:43:22
The spread is indicating a lot of people are betting MtGox is actually insolvent.  We'll see what happens.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:32:57
Or if people think mtgox is insolvent they do business at other exchanges and the spread blows out at mtgox....

"This is good for Bitcoin"
Having a lot of market power (ie being a whale) means you can tank or run up a market with a small float and take the arbitrage, esp if you can liquidate longs/shorts and force them to cover the other end of your trade.
The more this happens, the more it makes the asset more attractive to other people with a lot of money, that will want in on the action.  This tends to both bid up prices and spread out ownership over time.  People have to compete to get enough market power to make whale moves.
Over time, this also means the market becomes more well-developed and more difficult for any actor or small group to manipulate.
The fact that these kind of events still dominate prices to such a degree is another indicator in my mind that we are still at the very early stages of Bitcoin.  As long as you're not using leverage and can stand the volatility, this is a great asset to accumulate over time.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:34:22

There is a risk that your initial btc move to a new address or wallet is immediately rebroadcast (replayed) on the b2x network, causing you to lose your b2x before you can send it to an exchange.  Whatever you transact first, the coins on the other network are at risk.  The replay protection is gone or, if implemented, opt in, so you will need to flag the first btc transaction explicitly to prevent this (assuming this feature  actually ever makes it there), or use some alternative means to split your coins.  Google the instructions for your wallet in order to stay safe.

Pretty sure he actually owns Bitcoin but talks it down because he is still trying to accumulate.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:41:06
I agree, this is early still.  I asked a few people that had become curious but were on the fence about Bitcoin during the last ATH if they had noticed price was recovering, and no one had.  Furthermore, they were still skeptical, and believed if it came close to 20k again it would just crash again.  
I think it's going to 100k and possibly beyond this round. 
 When price swings start reaching 10k per day then I'll start getting excited.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:45:20
Yeah but how many people that don't know how to protect themselves from replay attacks will try to sell 2x, especially given how the BTC/BCH fork went a few months ago?
Even if you keep using only Bitcoin, something may happen.  There is a contagion risk that is outside your personal control.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:46:24
I think so, yes.  Especially given how benign the BTC/BCH fork was.  While you can protect yourself, I expect there will be a lot of people who will lose their BTC or B2X because of this fork due to not understanding the lack of replay protection, and that could have implications for confidence and future adoption.  There is also some tail risk for any exchanges that botch their internal replay protection.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:55:24
It's a trading term, it represents a large amount of money that will execute a buy if the price reaches a certain point.
In this case, it was Roger Ver signalling that he was going to prevent the price from dropping too far in an effort supply confidence and/or to bid up the Bitcoin Cash price.  But he removed that money before it got close to the point where it would actually execute.  In other words, it was a bluff.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:16:18
I agree, I wish there was a good way to deal with this issue, too.  But I don't see a change in the mining algorithm reaching consensus.  And overcoming the competitive advantage that's been carved out by the big miners under the existing rules and economic environment seems unlikely in the near term.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:03:44
I don't see any possibility of convincing their side via argument.  Of course, continue to put forward the Bitcoin messaging, but I don't have much sympathy for the people that are going to lose money chasing pump &amp; dumps by bad actors.  Hopefully they will learn something from it, but knowing how people are, many won't.  If the hashpower fluctuations are problematic, it might be a good idea to discuss changing the difficulty adjustment strategy on Bitcoin.  Personally, I'd like to close this attack vector.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:23:38
Yeah I'm right there with you.  Happy the price is this high, but feels like it's due for a correction for sure.  Letting some ride it out, but I took some profits, too.  Hard to believe how quickly it's moved just in the last few months.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:40:21
The risk is a lot of people think this will be a similar event to the BTC/BCH fork, where a good course of action was to sell your BCH for that "free money."
They don't understand what a replay attack is, and this fork has has no strong replay protection, unlike the BTC/BCH fork.  If you want to sell your B2X, you need to take some additional precautions to do it safely.
Therefore, expect a number of people to lose either their BTC or B2X, with no recourse.  And if any exchange has botched their internal replay protection, it's possible exchanges themselves could see huge problems.  If there is a lot of chaos, that could cause contagion follow on effects in the market.  So even if you do nothing, the price changes could impact you.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:01:03
History in progress :)
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:17:00
I think this is a good time to pick some up, and hope it drops further.
Just remember the hashwar in BCH has little to do with the rhetoric coming out of those camps.  BCH is a lucrative scamcoin with a well-functioning information apparatus around it.  Having control of that is worth a lot of money, so the camps may be willing to sell a lot of their Bitcoin to gain the upper hand.  
The people involved seem to have some personality disorders, too.  With some luck, they will lose a lot of their Bitcoin, and also damage or destroy their own scam because of their animosity.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:23:04
Totally unlikely.  I still don't know anyone who actually owns any within my immediate circle of friends, family, coworkers.
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:55:27
Super difficult to judge.  If this winds up being a big bull run and starts running through new all time highs, I tend to look for signs of "irrational exuberance," ie over coverage in the mainstream media, everyone frothing over lambos (especially people who are super new to crypto), and an explosion of scammy activity related to crypto- ie Bitconeeeect, Blockchain brand tea, etc.  Personally I think if this does become a big bull run, it could get to $100k this time or even more, but really it's impossible to know or be confident about where price is going in this space.
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:30:11
Not crazy or irrational at all.  Not even unusual.  Almost every asset type and market has a set of long term believers or people who will find it more attractive at lower prices.

I can see &gt;$400,000 Bitcoin, just probably not in this cycle.
The Winklevoss were arguing for ~$400k a while back based on Bitcoin replacing the function of gold.  A lot of people claim gold spot price is held down via extensive re-hypothecation and other price fixing efforts in the financial markets, so I could see it going higher if a lot of people "take delivery" by controlling their private keys themselves.
Beyond that, when I see arguments based on "not every millionaire could even get one" I think that could still undervalue Bitcoin, since it overlooks all the governments, corporations, and institutions that would need to have it if Bitcoin truly became global money.  
But at that point, I suspect price will be set as much due to failing values in other currencies, and thinking of Bitcoin in terms of a dollar price will stop making sense.
