True that at this moment, the ~20K bitcoin has the largest network effect and BCH isn't available to most uninformed purchasers.  But over the past week, BCH has been getting significant airtime on Fastmoney, we're hearing about ETH and BCH Futures, its appears that Coinbase has incorporated API for BCH, Bitpay is now supporting BCH; so the uneducated might soon have a ton of info about ALTs and the ability to trade them without going on Korean exchanges.  In Canada QuadrigaCX lets you buy BCH, I know many people who have been able to see beyond the 20K bitcoin very quickly.  But at this moment, yes you're right about the 20K bitcoin.  However OP's statement is quite myopic.

The problem with telling people to just wait for LN, is it assumes that the price will hold.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:26:54
The problem for BTC is that they are competing for Hash.  And they seem to need around 95% and clearing blocks at 8 per hr to maintain throughput.  As long as people are willing to pay higher and higher fees, then sure they can coexist.  However as BCH price rises, Hash for BTC will move in relation, so that 95% keeps getting lower.

You should ask yourself why people aren’t using it.  Why is Coinbase not implementing it...
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:35:28
No man, he supports BCH.  He's being sarcastic.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:59:22
You should probably understand why its dropping before being so happy about it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:29:38
It’s gonna be expensive to move all your coins off Coinbase.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:34:46
Fee's don't matter.  It's a storage of wealth.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:23:56
Look at the mempool and the fees, there is nothing wrong with that info.  Andreas says the real bitcoin is whatever people use.  There is no "real" bitcoin.  Go and listen to him.

If you're stupid enough to be buying at this ATH, you deserve to lose money.  You should not be giving people financial advice.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:42:52
Question is which will be first, 10K or a cleared mempool
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:03:02
You don't realize that block size has already been increased.  If Core does it, it will just be another Altcoin.  The whole reason Bcash exists is because Core would not increase the block size.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:41:57
Lol nah man, couldn’t care less about karma.  Didn’t down vote you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:18
Approaching 120K
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:31:46
I don't think fee's will be going down for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:51:47
Blocksize has been increased, its called "the other coin"

Sell your coins, pay the loan and go back to school.  You should not be using a payday loan for ANYTHING.

It's sad there is so much hate for the growth of Crypto.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:09:20
There is no bait and switch, all this info is publicly available.  Look at the Mempool, look at the Hash rate, look at the price direction, Steam has dropped BTC, Bitpay has picked up BCH.  Its very clear, there is no bait and switch.  Don't be blinded by the price.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:56:49
Is it because of the Bitpay news?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:56:57
I'm not a shill and I don't want to see people lose money.  Good luck to you!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:30:40
It's not artificial.  There is a reason this is happening.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:18:16
It's already over 100K
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:53:47
Yeah and how long will that take
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:18:08
Traders like to make money without actually holding the underlying.  And to short it.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:05:16
Then why did Charle Lee dump his?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:15:25
Fee's are higher then you have in coin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:17:09
You need to place a stop-limit.  Or the order will fill at whatever the next bid is.  The thing is, the bid price could be much lower then the stop price you have set.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:07:16
I'm not sure why anyone needs to convince you.  Do some research and then make an informed decision.  If you don't see a future, don't invest.  And you should always diversify investments.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:28:03
They did, its call BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:29:21
HODL was about daytrading, not holding on for dear life while the network slows.  OP does understand.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:42:12
I respectfully disagree.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:29:11
Haha I started answered it, then paused and was like WTF am I doing
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:13:39
Have you noticed that the hash power is leaving bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:46:55
Get verified on QuadrigaCX.  As much as HODL is the gospel around here, you should have a way to sell back to Fiat.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:01:26
Just wait till next weekend, then you will see real panic. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:13:12
What if I told you all coins are traded back and forth between bots.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:14:33
I don't understand this type of mentality.  I mean we all want crypto to succeed.  New people are entering the market, not everyone is an "expert".  Why make fun of people who sold cause they were worried about losing all their money.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:41:05
Unless you sold 20 mins ago, how did you lose?
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:05:40
Everyone here says HODL like its gospel.  Personally, I agree with you.  I sold at 7:30 this morning.
