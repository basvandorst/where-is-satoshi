Four hours later, the original poster: "Mine came through in the end." 
Not closed. Just laggy.

Why do you think those uses aren't wide or legitimate?

I think the actual danger is not a cryptocompetitor with *backing*, but a competitor with *support* and *adoption*. If Bank of America, for example, launched essentially a copy of BitCoin, but with a new block chain, a seed mining operation, and the requirement that you pay them some small transaction fees, and then they cancelled all their customers' debit cards, and mailed everyone smart cards that could make Boacoin transactions, then I think Bitcoin would potentially be in for a crisis.
Imagine if you could switch to a new cryptocurrency that was the same, except there were a hundred million regular people throughout the world with accounts with whom you could send and receive money. Imagine if all those people had bitcoin functionality built into their bank smartphone app. Imagine if everywhere that accepts VISA accepts that currency.

If paying a nickel is too much for you, you can choose a lower fee. Someone on the forums said they paid 0.00001 (a tenth of a penny) and got confirmed within an hour: 
Another comment suggests that the minimum for getting relayed (to miners by pools? I think that's what that means?) is 0.0001, about a penny. They suggest that should be enough to get you in within a couple blocks (30mins):

What does loving free markets have to do with people expressing their *opinions* about your behavior?
(by the way, I don't think you're evil for buying a dog from a good, loving breeder. I just think you're doing something for yourself, which every one of us is guilty of at some point. I just think calling this a free trade issue when people are just exercising their free speech is bullshit.)

No, it could stabilize as grannies realize their childhood dream was to see Europe, and they sell a beanie baby and live their goddamn lives.
The price will just rise to the point where the grannies selling out can supply the whole of the demand amongst collectors and then stop.

I see a big explosion of benign sending-money-to-your-family-back home which is difficult/impossible/expensive to do with USD, but trivial with locally traded bitcoins.
(as one example)
Edit: Or large payments to foreign contractors in less constitutionally sound states.
Or donating money to WikiLeaks. Plus the long tail of politically controversial organizations.
All you need, to stay above $100, is for the float for those things to add up to a billion dollars.

I think $10k is fairly likely, and have said so.
I'm a holder of bitcoins, so obviously I have some incentive, but I mostly enjoy making predictions because I'm a futurist and Bitcoin is one of the most fascinating developments in the last decade, technical or political. I bought my coins when it was much lower and the possibility for making real money was much less... established... and even then I felt like $10k was a reasonable mid-range target.

Why? What if Bitcoin is only ever used for people transferring money to their third world grammas? What if it's only ever used for drugs and guns? Why is it only successful if you can pay your rent and buy groceries?

I've been banging my head against Ripple for a bit. It's sort of hard for me to wrap my brain around for some reason. Here's my current understanding:
It's 100% based on a social trust network. You want to get 100 Swiss Francs to your friend Helmut in Switzerland, but you only have USD. If there's a chain of trust between you and that person, you essentially get everyone along the way to "vouch" for the transactions. Jen trusts you to pay. Mike trusts Jen to pay. Tad trusts Mike to pay, yada, yada, yada, and at the end of that chain Ulrike has Swiss Francs and trusts Helmut to pay them back.
So Ulrike gives Helmut the Francs, and get's what is essentially an IOU (I owe you) in the Ripple system. You're then on the hook for that IOU in USD.
Then, Jack, who lives near you but who you don't know, wants to sell some Bitcoins for USD, and there's a trust chain between you and them. Hamm trusts Jack, Bennie trusts Hamm, down to you.  So you give Jack the USD$100, he effectively takes on the IOU, and your "debt" to Ulrike is taken care of, as far as Ripple is concerned. 
Of course, Ulrike hasn't necessarily gotten his Francs back, and may never choose to take them out. They may hold them as Ripple (XRP) forever. But the idea is they feel safe at least floating that value in the system temporarily.
Edit: Cleaned up the example.
