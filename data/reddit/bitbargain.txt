This time they didn't *own* the coins, they just *controlled* the coins.
Bitcoin: whoever controls it, owns it.
I'm not sure if this document actually 'forced' Bitfinex not to have cold storage. Does the regulation really prevent cold storage? If so, isn't Kraken affected by it as well?

Noone can verify anything for certain without knowing every little detail of the code. But within reason, I can safely say that this is just the opposite of a scam. It's a big milestone for LN.

Works as advertised. Deposited coins to BB and made an invoice payment from BB to the one generated by the Lightning Wallet app. Both happened in &lt;1sec.
For comparison: doing the same with Eclair sometimes results in the channel being force-closed somehow, at other times it takes 5 minutes for the payment to maybe appear, but definitely 30+ seconds the first time, and maybe then it can be &lt;10sec for consecutive payments to the same peer.
Nice to see all that hassle gone with this app. Actual (real) quick payments and the ability to receive coins is definitely a big step for bitcoin.
Here's a video demo of me depositing and withdrawing via LN:

Add two extra factors that have to do with UK banking:
(1) It's easy to lose a bank account, even without fraud happening.
(2) Payments are faster than in the US or using SEPA, and free. So many people end up paying an extra for the convenience and the speed, meaning that there is a market for (1)

Not really. We do try to allow as many people to buy coins without verification as possible - limited amounts only, of course. If you trade on a regular basis or want to spend more than just a hundred pound or two, it is best to ease the sellers' mind and get that little green badge on your profile. 19% of our buyers have verified ID, the rest are occasional and one-time buyers (many of them from November-December 2013).
About the 'safe' part: the bank transfer will reveal your name anyway. As for the seller's point of view: one nasty stolen bank account or man in the middle fraud by a malicious buyer and they stand to lose their money and bank account.
The marketplace is not supposed to be anonymous unless you maybe use Ukash which has a ridiculous fee, a lack of sellers and often perfectly legitimate vouchers will be rejected by Ukash (PaySafe card is also known to misjudge an everyday regular voucher purchase and demand to send the funds back to a bank account, which the buyer might not even have).
My question to abitofanoobcoin is, who are you trying to keep from learning your name? The site? We don't care for it, we do not abuse your personal information. The seller? S/he will see it on his/her statement. Something else? I am possibly missing the essence of the question here.
If you have any specific concerns or questions, I'm happy to answer if I can.

I want to thank iwilcox for encouraging this agenda and making the blog. I run the UK marketplace called BitBargain at  - a lot of folks buy bitcoin there, we have 50,000 registered members.
BitBargain pretty much begs the buyers to remove coins ASAP after purchase and the sellers not to store more coin than the amount they can afford to lose, but I still decided to make a gesture and prove solvency (and with a cron script, generate the solvency.txt every day from now on).
BitBargain sellers can obtain this file at 
- Why a flat list?
- The number of users and how much coin a seller has is more or less public already. Also, this method is easier to check manually.
- Why sellers only?
- Making the list of fresh vouts public would be too much of a compromise on the buyers' privacy. They shouldn't care anyway, because they are discouraged from storing too much coin on the site - the wallet is supposed to be a temporary placeholder only.
I look forward to proof of solvency becoming the norm for exchanges.

Unfortunately not. It would be great because then sellers could easily return the funds if they wanted (as opposed to asking for proof etc). Even if someone does manage to sign up for a DD in your name using your sort &amp; acct (which again the seller doesn't see except in case of one or two banks if both buyer and seller are with the same bank), you can simply request that the bank returns the money. Yes it's a stupid system that someone could spend your money (even if just temporarily) using your sort/acct but it's information you will have to give out to people anyway (to receive money).

We've been operating since xmas of 2012 and hundreds of buyers get their coins from us every day. We have 70,000 users in total.
What we don't offer:
- cash deposit

What we do offer:
- Bitcoin, Litecoin, Namecoin
- a 5 minute average trade time (from start to finish)
- quick and efficient customer support
- free withdrawals (you get exactly as much coin as you buy, we pay the mining fee)
- the ability to choose your seller (so you don't have to set up a new payee if there are multiple sellers at a similar price)
- still simple to use (+1 click to select the seller, rather than being connected to one randomly)
- ability for sellers to offer a discount on bulk purchase
- price alert feature (so you can request a text message if someone has coins for sale at a price you like)
- UK (FPS) bank transfer, Pingit, Paym, PYC, Ukash, and some other payment methods
- ID verified honest sellers who have taken the seller test and won't leave you hanging after you have sent the money

Keep up the good work, man.
I've bought 4 Trezors already and am happy with them. Yes it would be nice for the price to come down but I understand it's a business and you need to sell them for $100+ for a while to cover the initial R&amp;D costs.
This means that for now it's mostly the hardcore Bitcoin subculture that buys them. But I'm looking forward to the time when the newcomers with about a $200 stake in BTC can still say "I'll buy a Trezor to keep it safe".

Those black lines didn't look very convincing, so I wanted to see a proper chart.
I fetched a max of 3-month periods from Google so I could get daily data and combined it with the price history.
Note: the bitcoinaverage.com CSV data completely missed the 27th of October so I just inserted an avg.
Here's the pretty picture:
And here's the actual XLS with the detailed USD price vs Google Trends data for each day:
My take on it when looking at the daily data instead of the chart:
1) Would need a more detailed samples to make out anything.
2) Not very convinced this is usable. On a daily level, there are too many occurrences of the search trend not predicting or even following the price.

Thanks for the insight.
I hope I didn't sound too strong regarding Eclair. I have used it with success before and it too was a big step when it came out. Thanks for all your hard work.
I also understand that LN-wallet uses some cheats to get the results. But at the end of the day, the ability to pay quickly, reliably and user experience is what will decide if we use LN in everyday life or not. For now, if anyone asks me for a LN wallet I will recommend LN-wallet.

I didn't know it. Thanks for pointing that out.
Even if this was completely original work, I wouldn't diss on Eclair. I didn't mean for it to come off like that.
But I've had my fair share of frustration with Eclair and the difference hit me in the face and I may have gone overboard with the enthusiasm.
For payments, Eclair will be just as good (with focus on different aspects) as this app once the bugs are hammered out.
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:20:16
I didn't know you dev'd Eclair. Obviously I'm your fan since PageSigner and didn't mean to offend.
Unfortunately everything I said is true, generous or not. My friend is using Eclair (same version, connected to the same node) and for him it's like 1 successful payment out of 10, and even that takes *minutes*. We did some testing with both Eclairs running on our phones just yesterday (same, latest version) as we're working on LN deposits and withdrawals for a different site. Results all over the place. Sending a payment and it not making it into the list, just appearing later as "pending" is also something that I don't think should happen. Plus the 'uncooperative close' as a result of just trying to send a payment sometimes. There's also the "invalid signature" problem, perhaps it's been fixed since. The list goes on.
I've posted several issues (and did my best to extract all the relevant logs) on LND's Github and one on Eclair as well to try to help you guys figure out where the culprit lies.
In your defense, at least Eclair can connect to any node. LN-Wallet works for now, but it won't scale as long as it requires a feature that pretty much none of the nodes have right now.
I do look forward to having 3-4 apps out there which are all reliable and can send/receive and connect to most nodes. I'm optimistic that we'll get there eventually.

99.99% of the time when this happens, either btc.blockr.io or blockchain.info is down or doesn't see updated blocks.
If you're using bc.info then use blockr.io instead and vice versa, you should see the transaction.

I will, just not here because:
1) This is Bitty's thread.
2) I'm not looking for feedback from people with the "either with us or against us" mentality and they will inject themselves into the conversation anyway.
I did consider to allow trading with no withdrawals, but that would require deposits by sellers in advance and it probably wouldn't last for much volume for very long in practice. I'd have to put up very big and strong warning signs about lack of withdrawals and the one thing I've learned in all these years is that there will always be that one buyer who doesn't read the warnings displayed.
Thanks for your feedback so far. Let's hope UASF won't be needed or if it is, the match will end quickly.

I wasn’t up for being pushed around when people were demanding that I switch to Bitcoin Unlimited and I won’t be rushed into compiling custom code to reject certain blocks and be a tool in the toolset of politics against miners now.
The default stance is to run the reference Core client as it is and therefore be compatible with most of the network unless there’s a VERY good reason not to. The idea is to sell the coins that people want to buy.
And while I support SegWit in general, I do have some doubts about how it is going to make everything scale so much better so quickly because 1) the load on the blockchain is due to the growth of the userbase, not the same few users sending each other many transactions 2) it will take time before it’s properly implemented by wallets and used in practice by users. With that in mind, hardforking SW at a given date in roughly two months, no matter what, using custom compiled code seems a bit extreme.
In a month or two, if my impression is that there’s a 50-50% chance of BIP148 ‘winning’, I’ll let others play chicken while BB is possibly down for a day, waiting for the losing chain to die off. **I don’t like the idea of risking my users’ money because some people are in a hurry**. If I feel like everyone will be supporting it, I may get on board. I just don’t see that to be a likely outcome at this time.
If you want to announce that you’ll no longer be using [BitBargain]( because of me taking the safe approach, I understand it, no problem. For now it looks like I won't be going to the Bitcoin Casino that day. Thanks for understanding.
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:29:13
Exactly. You have two choices: 1) having to trust someone to give you back coins when you ask for it 2) having sole access to your coins.
You'd have to have a really good reason to choose (1), they would need to provide many usability benefits that you wouldn't get with option (2).
So no, don't store your coins online in a web wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:14:17
We have 6,000 verified users on BitBargain already, but I find it a bit unfair if those wishing to casually buy 10-20 GBP worth of coins will need to do full AML/KYC. Most people will not bother, or they will just use a non-UK marketplace to get around it.

I have a write-up about which wallets are recommended to new bitcoin owners. It starts with "IT DEPENDS" (how much you have, how much it's worth, how often and how much you spend, and many other things).
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:58:39
You missed the part where I said I'd rather shut down the site temporarily instead of risking user funds (and switch to whatever winning chain when the game is over). That is far from 'inaction' and it's also the safest (but least lucrative) option.
I wonder if "no risks with UASF" is really the case if UASF has low miner AND user support. In the pro-UASF posts I read many scenarios were mentioned, but not this one. It seems suspect that there is a big risk involved in keeping the site up and using UASF. Maybe a bit less than running regular Core. But definitely more than letting it play out for a day. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm definitely not going to discuss it here further after the kind of responses I got for responding to a user's request in public. Not spending another few days wrapping my head around all the small details or using the word 'hard fork' was a mistake, but not as big of a mistake as posting in a thread where people (Belcher, Marc and yourself excluded) are out for blood. My stance is that I will do more studying, will wait for the picture to get clearer and I will decide in time what to do. There might not even be a decision involved by then. I actually like Reddit for the most part but some of the responses to my post were cancer so for now this is my final post on this topic. I will be discussing it elsewhere though because it's an important event and if there's a way I'd like to keep the site up, it just seems like it will never be as safe as waiting it out.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:11:38
Not running a custom bitcoind with a patch to force a hard fork and instead running the reference client that pretty much everyone else will be running on the 1st of August is 'stupid' and has you put me on a 'shitlist'. I see. That's a strong consequence and I really can't argue with that.
I will be sure to ask Luke-Jr to absolve me of my sins.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:08:27
Good points.
We are in different situations. You don't have a wallet for users and so the TX costs more per purchase (/user) because you can't do bulk. But the same difference means you can keep supporting both chains that day without much risk.
It sounds like we both just want to let the market decide what it wants, we are just in a different situation technically and need to use different methods to get there.
I understand your position and in the end we will be selling coins on the same chain I'm sure.
@_date: 2015-10-04 12:06:27
I would like to share my experience about how the issue is affecting us and the users on BitBargain.com.
1) The day before yesterday we received an email from a customer who was denied a deposit on bidybit.com. Apparently they kept the customer's coins, saying they relied on blockcypher.com's API and they have a policy against double spends (which is fine, as long as you don't have a policy against coins confirmed dozens of times). I sent the user a 'copy' of the coins (will not be doing this in the future, but it was a small amount).
2) A seller complained that coins he deposited were 'doubled', but one part is still in Unconfirmed. This will keep happening until a fix unfortunately.
3) Problems with MultibitHD / Trezor - updated: "issue has resolved itself"
The last time this malleability issue struck, I had to basically dump the whole wallet with pywallet, write some scripts to clean &amp; rebuild it, etc.
It's been only two days with a limited number of people playing this game, but malleability is already causing a significant headache for my users (and myself too, because it messes up the balances reported by bitcoind and makes the daily audit quite hard to perform, not to mention the amount of emails I will receive from users asking about deposit and withdrawal problems that I will need to reply to and explain the situation).
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:12:45
The bigger problem I think is telling someone new to BTC to send their coins to cold storage when that is more of an answer to the "i have too much BTC and don't want to lose it" type of question.
A new BTC user should try out the leading wallets, spend online, find local places, accept it on their website, trade, accept more BTC for work, make the most of it... Not send it to cold storage and say "i have bitcoins in the most secure wallet, even I can't use them!"
As for security of the coins (i won't go into the irony of the suggestion to trust the paper wallet to a bank), a lot can go wrong. Usually when it comes to spending and the user ending up taking a shortcut, using a not-so-offline computer for example. I've also heard of someone messing up and the coins stuck on a change address they didn't have the keys for, etc.
Possibly Luke-Jr will go into crypto weaknesses of these javascript solutions compared to Bitcoin Core, but it's just a guess :)

Thanks, belcher. That is certainly a more informative response than the "shitlisted" one.
I have yet to do more reading to understand the risks involved with running a BIP148 client vs running the untouched one as has always been the case. I always try to be careful. There are still 2 months left and I'm definitely behind on understanding the choices and the consequences in depth. I posted my initial thoughts after being challenged in email just a few hours ago, but the devil's in the details, so I'm still open to changing my stance until the time comes.

There were ridiculous balances reported by bitcoind the last time this malleability issue came up in 2014. The thing that put an end to it was the fix/update. I still had to put a lot of extra work into cleaning up and all, but finally we could move on. See my other post about the ways this is affecting our users and us.

Small correction, I know it wasn't the point but to avoid any misunderstandings I'd like to clarify: TLSNotary is very handy when it comes to mistakes by the buyer/bank or genuine misunderstandings.

It genuinely looked like this post was made by him, every detail was the same except the purchase date (which I missed).
No problem at all, I'm glad this is resolved. If it's not a big request, would you be so kind to edit your original post and add "UPDATE: resolved, i see the refund" or something similar? Thanks.

Above a certain limit everyone will be required to submit IDs, unfortunately that is what is required. The plus side is that sellers can be more relaxed (which is reflected in the amount available for purchase as well as prices).
The reason some of you have to verify IDs earlier than others: multiple accounts. Yes, we do display "Strictly one account per person" but there are many people out there who if they forget their password will just create a new one. That doesn't fly on BitBargain. Both accounts are marked as 'suspicious' and you can't use the site until ID veirfication. It's either this, or requiring IDs even for a 10 GBP purchase. I chose this.
Thanks for all the recommendations by the way :)

Pingit could do a lot with bank accounts.
1) If you're receive only - any payments entering your Pingit go to your bank account directly (not allowed on BB anymore).
2) If you're a Barclays customer - your Pingit account is the same as your bank account, pretty much.
He did contact BitBargain, and after I repeatedly asked him to check his statements (to no avail), the buyer switched to Reddit instead to make a scam-thread against a reputable seller with over 700 trades.
@_date: 2013-01-05 22:29:58
'Little guys' are welcome too. It's more about reputation.
@_date: 2013-09-07 22:32:33
I figured I'd respond to this here, seeing that the user suddenly abandoned our e-mail conversation and decided to continue it on Reddit, without me.
What really happened:
The seller (who has over 700 trades on BitBargain) had his Pingit or bank acct shut down, of course without notice, while trading.
He contacted his bank and they told him that he wouldn't get the funds already on way, instead they would be refunded to the senders in 2-3 days automatically.
He has delivered the coins for all 3 (or maybe 4) trades by then of course, so he asked me to contact the affected buyers and kindly ask them to return the funds via bank transfer when they got the refund (NOT BEFORE!).
Now, the first buyer quickly confirmed having received a refund and sent it back to the seller. The second one didn't respond to e-mails but when he next came to the site and saw the request, he contacted us, checked his statement for the returned funds and re-paid the seller as well.
The only buyer not responding for long was the OP. After some time the OP tried to purchase on BitBargain but couldn't, as the site requested him to get in touch with us first.
Now, I've seen banks do all kinds of crazy stuff, so I'm not at all saying that it's impossible that everyone got his refund but the OP. But you have to admit it's not very plausible. Especially taking into account that the OP never responded until he needed something from us, he didn't seem to want to bother with any of this even after several explanations, and even in my last e-mail I had to ask the OP to actually check his statement and see if the funds were returned. I got my reply on Reddit instead of e-mail. Up to this point I expected the OP to respond "oh sorry, now I see it, will return funds".
Bottom line: I'm still happy to help debug this problem in e-mail (perhaps exchange screenshots, communicate with the seller and the banks to find out where the funds could be, etc).
UPDATE: my bad. Based on HEY_PAUL's response this is a different case that I haven't been made aware of yet. I will hold off with posting Reddit comments until I get the information in e-mail and get a chance to talk to the seller.

Thanks for this insightful comment that you posted after having carefully examined the facts.

Unfortunately the government WILL come in to your store sooner or later if you have a Bitcoin logo on your window, make a test purchase and screw you in some way. It's not happening yet, but it will.

Noone ever asked the buyer to repay anything if he was still out of money. We just expected he got the refund already (just didn't realize) based on the fact that everyone else got their refund.

Saw this page in the referers. Thanks for posting it.
Regarding turnaround: I think many factors are at play. Let the stats speak. 0-5 minutes: 20 deals. 5-10 minutes: 52 deals. 10-20 minutes: 36 deals. 20-30 minutes: 9 deals. These times are all-inclusive, meaning they include first and confirmation response time by the seller and response time / payment by the buyer. With Pingit, you never have late payments. If you're in the UK and don't know what Pingit is, google Barclays Pingit. It's pretty cool and completely free.
On the topic of getting burned by hacked bank accounts: you already have OTC and LocalBitcoins to find sellers, and most of the time everything goes better than expected. It's not so much the hacked bank accounts, but man-in-the-middle attacks that are the biggest risk to sellers IMHO. To combat this problem, we have optional phone number &amp; bank account verification that the sellers can decide to require from their buyers. I imagine as the site grows and becomes a bigger target for scammers, the sellers will prefer to use these settings and leave a few other offers for maximum 1 or 2 BTC that will require no verification in order to still allow new buyers to gain confidence and just a bit of BTC to start out with.
"Traders can't buy bitcoins": I'm not sure I know what you mean. Sometimes Netizen has under-the-spot prices. The system also allows a seller to create an offer with say a minimum of 100 BTC and a lower price. I know there isn't one there like it right now, but maybe in the future. We've just recently launched, it's probably better for now if the sellers don't store hundreds of bitcoins online with us (each). Most people buy between 5 and 15 coins.

In your case (for now) it's more about MLR liability. If we allow a little bit of BTC purchase without ID checks, we have to make damn sure that money launderers can't just create multiple accounts and get around the limits like that. That's why we filter open proxies, server farms, TOR, mark any accounts with a non-UK IP suspicious etc. Thanks for understanding.
