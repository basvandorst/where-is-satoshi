we believe Bitcoin will succeed, businesses like Circle are allowing for mainstream adoption without the end user realizing the nuances associated with these types of transactions. This is just the beginning. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:26:33
We provide an aggregated price that is used by many of the industry's leading businesses.
Our documentation can be found here:

Ah ok, apologies for being blunt then :)
I've spoken with 2-3 staff at bitstamp, they cannot do anything, its incapsula's lookout and they aren't replying. I've even spoken with staff on here from incapsula too, but no outcome. 
Unforunately for now there is nothing we can do, i feel most sorry for traders who's scripts are probably losing them money right now. As pointed out in another thread instead of returning a proper error code, they are returning valid JSON data, thats outdated etc, they really shouldn't be protecting the API if they handle things like this

We are still receiving 200 OK's, and this data:
{"high": "582.10", "last": "566.82", "timestamp": "1401390451", "bid": "568.27", "vwap": "569.96", "volume": "9320.73955933", "low": "560.05", "ask": "568.66"}
It was just by chance really that i spotted it.
Its now been almost a day and a half and we still can't get fresh data, its really not good enough. Whats worse imo is that we only poll them every 10seconds, way above their limits and way below what would be considered malicious activity..
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:28:29
It doesn't look like it no, as for using a single source, well thats why you'd have a fallback or two.
@_date: 2014-01-01 12:59:36
It is great to see more and more sites using our data, and now quite a few others using the original source themselves!
It would be nice though, for the constant improvements and additions we make, if sites as large as this would at least mention where they obtained the code they are using.
On another note we have a few more features and improvements coming this month, so keep an eye out!
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:52:34
Hi, this isn't true. What you've referenced there is the server side config that changes to are not always committed, for example in the scenario that we need to temporarily remove an exchange for some reason.
Please use the API or the frontend itself to see what exchanges are being included at any one time:
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:54:51
good stuff, and no problem :)
@_date: 2014-06-29 09:21:14
Yes, what we said previously is the answer to this thread, its not fake its just not comparable 
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:02:34
We need and are in the process of developing a v2 of the API which is needed to support other currencies. 
Unfortunately being an open source project and relying almost solely on donations we don't have the capital to get things done overnight, though we would love to be able to do that! The people who've worked on bitcoinaverage over the past year have done so on a purely voluntary basis, and for no financial gain, this does however limit how much can be achieved 
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:01:01
We've been operating for 8months, and yes i don't see any difference to our calculations.
I hate to see them trying to patent a formula though where instead we open sourced our code
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:43:20
Suggestions on the name?
We do already have hundreds of 1000s of users per month, and many apps and services using our API, including Andreas' android bitcoin wallet with 150,000 users alone
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:20:06
Hi all,
Just an update that we've changed over from a profile to a page at Google+, unfortunately this means loosing existing followers, so thought we would post this here as well as on twitter and the forums to ensure people are aware.
Another small note, we are currently working on an improved API, and android/iOS apps, so stay tuned
Kind Regards
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:42:12
We can only apologise, we've been concentrating on other large improvements to be introduced in the coming weeks, this will now be  priority (sanity checks)
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:07:29
Preev only averages a few exchanges, I'm not sure what bing or Google use but we provide an average of approx 40 exchanges and weight price based on global currencies as well :)
Keep an eye on the above section of the site we have a few more features coming soon
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:31:41
We don't trade :)
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:13:52
We integrate the most exchanges, around 40 i believe currently, and the most currencies. We then provide a global average ontop of the local market average
We have been contacted by some exchanges from argentina, bitex.la have just been integrated but they, like a lot of others, convert to USD which is then traded on the platform.
EDIT: please email us with any exchanges that are trading ARS so we can get them integrated!
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:04:24
Its a shame when we've had this service on a much broader scale for the best part of a year and have maintained the exchange integration along with the community's help and suggestions.
Yet the guy below is probably right, their price will end up being quoted in the media because of their faces :)
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:28:43
its not
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:05:07
It seems this is a real area of confusion, we do post updates to our project thread on bitcointalk, maybe its time we setup a small blog purely for changes like this. But once again, MtGox has been removed totally for now!
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:46:34
Bitcoin only price index you say? :)
@_date: 2014-06-01 10:03:19
Their ticker is returning us 2 day old data, our IP is blocked by incapsula, and i receive 403's from other servers, even locally in browser i'm seeing an 'Error 16' code.
Please raise your own ticket with bitstamp to help push this through, they have responded to us but nothing has been done.
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:40:02
Courtesy of Justcoin :)
Fixed and removed, sanity checks are now a top priority.
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:32:27
well, since each of huobi, okcoin by itself has more volume than whole world combined - it's not really an option. It will not even just "distort" the price, it will replace it. Whole world's price will be replaced with just price by these two exchanges. Something more sophisticated is needed here.
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:03:57
Hey, yes feel free to use our average and historical data. We have a stream for our global average on the way.
If there is anything else you are looking for drop us an email, or to implement something that you have in mind  :)
@_date: 2014-06-19 08:50:37
Same with bitstamp, i reported it to them last time they had issues (about 2 weeks ago) for over 48hours our IP was banned by incapsula, they are still using them on their API, i just don't understand!
@_date: 2014-05-26 13:08:12
You can see the exchanges/platforms here:
As already stated its due to there being no GBP denominated exchanges that can be funded with a domestic transfer. Most people buying larger amount will use something like bitstamp, which is denominated in USD, generally smaller buyers are happy to pay a few % point over 'spot' price, for convenience
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:06:05
Obviously have to suggest ourselves :)
@_date: 2014-06-01 11:45:41
Incapsula, i explained a little about using other IPs above, yes its happenening to many people from many IPs.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:11:09
Yes after 8 months of running i find it genuinely strange that they would try to patent something we have had open source for so long.
We are looking to make yet more improvements in the coming week, anybody who thinks they could help make some great improvements please contact us, bitcoinaverage
We are also looking for someone to handle a few small PR jobs, again please do email us!
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:02:10
Who are you?
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:09:35
We don't include OKcoin and Huobi currently. As mentioned by someone else in this thread its actually the USD volume that has died off, i've not seen them this low for a while!
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:19:09
Sorry to be a little spammy, but this problem has been solved for a long time already. 
We've developed and grown along with the community's support and suggestions from day 1
@_date: 2014-06-10 14:34:47
I'm pretty sure we contacted them in the past regarding using our data
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:44:43
@_date: 2014-03-14 12:24:09
For now we've removed Bitcurex from both PLN and EUR Average calculations until official statement will be issued and tranding will be resumed.
@_date: 2014-07-07 13:52:12
We've just added this to /converter now also, please email us with any other minor points like this that we may have missed!
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:33:24
This is the reason, incapsula have blocked /api/ticker for 1000s of people. Bitcoinwisdom is using pusher for a stream.
I've tried 4 other servers i have, to write out their data so we can use it that way which worked for a few hours, but now we're getting a new 'Error code 16'. They need to drop incapsula ASAP, at least for their API
note: you replied on the thread we made asking to PM you details, do you work for bitstamp or incapsula? if not what reasons do you have for wanting that information?
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:53:53
We did have an optional 'ignore mtgox' button when the first USD withdrawal issues came about. However, since we've coded 
'global averages' and funds were leaving mtgox in other currencies we decided to remove this feature (it was again only another temporary measure)
They have now been removed from all currencies until such time as they are operating as an exchange once again
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:33:43
No, nothing else affects weightings right now. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:42:49
Sure, the difference is we have many many more exchanges integrated than they do, and we provide both local currency markets as well as a global average which brings them all together. Its quite a lot of information to display and we've tried to keep it as minimal as possible.
We will be improving our charts page and other areas in the coming weeks.
If someone has the time and would like to contribute to a total overhaul that really would be a beneficial change please email us
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:54:50
No, it is MtGox, you can see this in the API and markets page below:
However, the user who posted the link did reference it wrong, as i explained in another comment the API should be used to see what exchange are included
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:08:21
We receive 100s of emails per week requesting new exchanges to be added, and pointing out problematic ones. Since we began the service 7 months or so ago we've listened to the community the whole way, the project is open source and many people have had input into decisions like this one.
@_date: 2014-06-29 14:54:07
Please email us and we'll look into a viable solution
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:26:28
I think its a little bit of both, but we had to remove them from our system when they launched their 0% fee model. It can't be used inline with exchanges that do have fees unfortunately so we need a more clever alternative :)
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:48:05
We can introduce this no problem, we really have tried to please everyone but it's a tricky task!.
We'll add a very simple ticker under /price
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:40:20
No doubt it's on a rampage!
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:29:49
The frontend is not at all an afterthought, would you be able to raise a ticket by emailing support with the exact issues you are experiencing, OS, browser and version, and any other useful information and we'll look into it ASAP.
@_date: 2016-11-02 16:11:19
Hi, we will not just shut the endpoints off if there is substantial traffic still arriving to it. What we are aiming to do as per the blog post and other articles in media is slowly add rate limiting, this will be staggered over the coming weeks/months.
We aren't intending to cause panic here, we have announced this many months ago and are just trying to reach the users that we have built up over the last 3-4years!
@_date: 2016-11-02 14:58:43
Eventually yes, hence the call to update code to use our new API structure!
The equivalent call for the above is: 
@_date: 2016-02-11 11:38:45
I hope that our blog posts and articles don't stop you using us, that would be quite sad. We can't please everyone, though we do try :) Many enjoy TA, and the response to our blog has been good.
Again, I hope it doesn't stop you using and recommending us, we aren't trying to "spam", we are just posting them here when they are published
@_date: 2015-11-10 15:02:49
that would have been 22CNY
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:22:59
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:28:45
Didn't read your post and its not even factual..
I was merely watching the address and posted up the info if its of interest for others
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:31:48
Seems totally relevant and the Cumberland Mining link is very interesting. What's more interesting is if its true how many coins they are snapping up, and how little information is on their homepage!
@_date: 2013-09-11 14:15:33
A higher volume yes, this does happen but what is the relevance to the price? I was under the impression you was talking about the price not updating not the trade volume so thanks for clearing this up
@_date: 2013-09-18 21:17:14
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-08-03 09:34:09
It looks like there is a general consensus to reformat the layout slightly, so this is what we will be doing
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:15:59
This is something we are doing due to a large amount of emails requesting it :)
@_date: 2013-09-05 06:53:04
We do, and infact the current volume is 25,000!
Could you let us know how you didn't notice this, is it not clear enough? Thanks
@_date: 2013-08-03 06:54:50
Thankyou, this has now been fixed.
@_date: 2013-09-11 13:08:57
Hello, I noticed this comment and was wondering if you could give a little more detail on the price spread you witnessed? Looking at our logs we haven't had any large downtime from bitstamp's API so you shouldn't have seen mtgox price being lower than bitstamps. If you could clarify that would be great!
@_date: 2013-08-03 11:51:19
yes, we'll definitely add RUB and more currencies soon
@_date: 2013-09-05 11:18:59
Yup its ~26,500 in the last 24hours from the exchanges we currently have added (ones with data sources so far)
@_date: 2013-09-18 21:24:40
Hi, it wasn't a case of we couldn't utilise their data as such, rather their data just isn't suitable. They replied to us stating that they are not an exchange but rather have a market maker model using other exchanges, therefore not really eligible to be used in a weighted average price.
We are always watching exchanges and if this changes let us know :)
@_date: 2013-09-18 21:16:41
Running for no profit gives these donations a huge impact, so thankyou
@_date: 2013-09-04 21:32:43
This was not the intention of our thread or comment and its a shame they have been viewed this way. We have listened to all community suggestions and requests for features from reddit and our bitcointalk thread over the past 4 weeks and are virtually up-to-date with implementing almost everything
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:13:25
Thankyou for all the kind comments, and everyone who has supported the service through donations and tips over the past few months. We are still nonprofit so these really do keep the service running and maintained.
Also remember the code is open source, so if you are willing, feel free to commit fixes/changes! Otherwise email us at bitcoinaverage :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:18:06
At the conception we wanted to keep each currency market separate, now that there are so many requests for a global rate, this is what we'll be doing as well
@_date: 2013-08-19 10:36:57
This will be implemented within a few days.
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:14:26
Thankyou for spotting this, we'll look into it
@_date: 2013-09-05 06:54:56
Yes there is a temporary option to ignore mtgox from calculations on the frontend and API
@_date: 2013-09-05 06:59:58
Hi, thanks for the comment. Could you explain what you mean by "intentionally leaving out other mtgox currencies"?. All currencies have their own separate average so if you are referring to smaller currencies not being displayed, then this doesn't impact any other average
@_date: 2013-10-04 17:57:46
Thankyou for the comment, we are glad that the project is of use to you :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:14:22
This is why we kept local currency markets separate, the price of bitcoin in the UK right now has a high premium as this figure shows.
We will add a global average very soon, and keep the local markets.
@_date: 2013-08-15 14:57:10
There are currently a few sites using our API, including bitmit.net. 
People still have concerns though, that mtgox shouldn't be included at all in our calculations. I think the solution to this currently is for us to develop a way for individual users of the API to opt out of certain exchanges.
Some changes coming over the next few weeks including the addition of localbitcoins, so keep checking back!
@_date: 2013-08-19 10:33:28
We have had many people disagreeing with including gox in our calculation. However, we cannot please all opinions.
In a few days we will therefore have two API prices, one for all exchanges (default) and one for 'omit-mtgox'. This will be a temporary workaround until its no longer needed. It will primarily be an API change, but will be added to the frontend as an option in the near future also.
@_date: 2013-09-11 21:16:41
Oh wow, that's the news. 
Hmm, we've been planning to open sources once few more planned features will be finished and we'll be out of beta, but seems like we need to do that now, just to make sure we do not use any shady "proprietary" calculations and that our API is public and free for all. 
We'll make site sources open as soon as possible, once we'll finish few things that are in development now and migrate repository to github. 
The funny thing here is that about just ten days we've sent an email to news saying who we are and what we do. Seems like they liked idea so much that decided to do it themselves.
@_date: 2013-08-03 13:54:04
This has now been updated. Currencies are clickable and will allow you to scroll.
@_date: 2013-09-19 10:14:49
Yes total daily volume
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:49:07
This comment does not represent the majority of feedback we have currently received
A weighted average across all exchanges does give a much more accurate price for people to use, knowing that mtgox isn't any longer a clear leader in market volume as you state. Currently they have 29.43% of 24hour volume
There are already a growing number of sites using our API purely for ticker purposes, that would rather show an average price of a bitcoin than simply a singular exchanges current rate
EDIT: This reply was not intended to come across as pretentious, so for that we are sorry. Instead of downvoting we would really appreciate constructive discussion!
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:14:19
Hi, Alex has updated our thread with a quick explanation to why we've done this:
Of course we try to please the majority, so if there is still a huge call for this in the future we'll reconsider it!
@_date: 2013-08-02 22:02:03
Hi, i will add headings to the tables tomorrow. 'at rate' represents the last price at that exchange, which is what the current averages for each currency are based on.
@_date: 2013-08-19 10:33:55
This will be added wednesday along with other changes.
@_date: 2013-08-27 07:57:24
Hi, we recently added most of these exchanges to BitcoinAverage. If people are aware of more please drop us an email.

More information for each currency like culumative volume is coming soon
