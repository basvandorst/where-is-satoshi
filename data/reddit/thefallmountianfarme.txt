@_date: 2015-03-01 03:48:40
No not surprised I kno just how far you have to travel to use one and I feel a whole lot better about just walking up to the btm as opposed to coin base or meeting someone I don't know and as far as the lack of demand I do understand it and  I think in the hopefully near future as education about bitcoin spreads the demand will as well  but thank you and I will check localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:40:05

Well I'm not for sure. I wasn't too bad. I remember thinking to myself its worth it because of how easy it was to me but I put 65 bucks in and got 60 in my wallet so about five bucks if I remember correctly
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:10:45

@_date: 2015-02-08 19:29:28
For me it wasn't going out of my way it was on the way home from work for example lol

@_date: 2015-02-08 19:30:15
To explain further I don't have any credit cards or banking accounts so way easier for me
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:49:59
