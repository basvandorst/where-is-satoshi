I'm not convinced by the 'slow month' theory. And really, a 50% drop is not a slow month, something has happened. And on the day of this drop a lot of FUD was created like the China ban. I just don't think that's a coincidence.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:50:45
Good for you! What kind of job is that?
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:42:07
Conspiracy theory, really? Banks and hedge funds have been manipulating regular markets for decades. Why wouldn't they do the same with the crypto market, especially as this is an unregulated market
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:49:52
FUD? This post is the opposite of FUD
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:09:12
Sorry to hear that, what happened? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:28:42
Really? I don't see it, which subreddit?
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:01:01
This is not FUD, people need to stop throwing this word for every post they don't like about crypto.

I see a lot of people talking about whales, but who are they exactly? Companies? Which one?
And how do they coordinate their moves?
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:17:21
The requirements are in the link I posted :) 
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:10:51
That was just a theoretical question I'm not actually picking words
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:52:07
Great thanks!

Hey I am trying the Lightning app on testnet but the funds I requested from the testnet faucet are still pending since yesterday  
Anyone got testnet btc here?
Link to the app
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:15:14
I didn't get it at first.
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:15:00
But then I understood.
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:19:58
Thank you
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:20:15
Interesting, thank you

Avez-vous fumé ?

I know what you mean bro, I did a "prépa" too. But the tests were 4h long where I was, I thought it was everywhere the same.

Those damn Chinese!

Yeah that's weird, I don't know how they achieve that level of discipline in their society, it must be some kind of slow stifling in every step of their life since their birth.

I can't disagree with that.  
That's why I think hodling is so much easier, you don't have to worry about tops or bottoms at all.
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:58:05
It might have worked so far, but maybe at some point you will think it  's going down, but it won't, and you will wish you hodled.  
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:11:27
Absolutely, nobody needs to know his identity.  
Here's an interesting question : if you could be the only one on earth to know his identity, but you could refuse to know it, what would you do?
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:36:24
Thanks, but actually it's already unchecked, so it's just a funny coincidence!
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:20:38


Depends on how much you are storing really.
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:05:05
I agree, if they went to that length it would mean they are clearly losing. But anyone already into bitcoin know they will lose eventually  
Now think about a beginner or someone who has never owned any bitcoin. If they heard of an attack of this size, it would probably scare them. I doubt their first thought would be "damn I should buy that currency that just got badly attacked"
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:54:00

I've seen a couple posts on this matter, you should be able to find them, and yes, the numbers are astronomical :)
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:07:31
He also has a really interesting blog. Kinda old school design but worth checking out. I really wish he wrote a book, that guy is so interesting
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:35:45
Yeah, and I'm buying their cheap bitcoin so I don't mind
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:11:34
And when you jerk off it feels SO real
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:28:43
True. The main effect will be to undermine the trust we put in bitcoin, but it won't kill it.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:27:51
I don't really know the origin of r/btc but I can tell you it's been filled with bitcoin cash propaganda for a very long time.

You're correct

I daytraded bitcoin in my head today and I got virtually REKT
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:41:35
My comment was ironic but anyway that's good advice :)
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:22:43
Yeah I would have, fortunately I don't have to :) :)
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:44:11
Damn you're optimistic, I think I'm gonna start selling a bit way before.

I am so tired i wznt too sleep very bad but I also want to see 12K before so I can have good dreams

I've been a long time hodler but the last crash was painful though, just trying something else for next time.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:42:26
I don't really know what to think about that.  
A few weeks ago Bruno Le Maire (finance minister) said the classic bullshit about bitcoin being used by criminals. He also said "blockchain is really promising, but bitcoin is another subject, it needs to be regulated".  
Then he appointed a "mister bitcoin" (as he called him) to help him, who is... a 71 yo former executive of the French central bank. Great.
So is it gonna be about innovation, as the article seems to say, or just regulation?
@_date: 2018-11-06 22:09:49
Can you repeat the question?
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:04:41
Thanks for the details.
I tried to download Samourai wallet but the android version I'm running is too old and I can't upgrade (it's a 4-year-old phone).
So I tried Mycelium and I like it so far. I intend to use it for relatively small transactions so it should do it.
But the default transaction fees are really high though, 400 sat/byte!
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:23:23
Thank you anyway, I hadn't thought of pinging him.
@_date: 2018-11-10 23:58:44
She seems like one of the most progressive monetary economists out there.
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:44:14
What does it even mean?
@_date: 2018-11-07 00:23:42
Do you have facts to back that up?
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:34:25
Yeah I have seen that, but there are 11 wallets on the list, I don't really want to try them all
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:16:00
Oh thanks but I think this is not his reddit username
The correct one is u/andreasma
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:09:32
Yes, you can adjust the fee, but it's still bothering having to check for the appropriate fee every time you want to make a transaction. 
It should be done automatically
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:36:47
Ok, I see your point
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:26:32
Great, thank you!  
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:09:08
Ok thanks, I will definitely try it
@_date: 2018-11-07 00:52:59
Tell me more
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:08:25
Good point
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:01:35
You don't own your private key when you use coinbase. To own your bitcoins you must own your private key, and be the only one to have it.
If you have a substantial amount of bitcoin you should get them out of coinbase.

Hi, I'm Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan. We need someone with your skills to be in charge of our new bitcoin department.
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:22:44
Sounds good in theory. Do you have an example where it worked?
@_date: 2018-07-16 22:13:59
Oh no, it was just a little wing
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:56:28
Oh yeah I'm alright you know, it was nothing.  
Now I'm trying to get my hands on some of that bitcorn thing, I heard you could buy drugs with it

I'm a really good hacker, I've actually hacked bitcoin many times
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:12:15
I guess I'm looking for what is more efficient within the limits of decency towards another human being.  
Relying on local and individual charity seems too unpredictable. I think at some point you have to put some trust in the government, even if corruption is inevitable, because no solution will be perfect anyway.

@_date: 2018-07-03 19:06:33


Maybe they want to, but who do you give the money to? Directly to some homeless people that you encounter on the street? Not really efficient.  
To some organisation? You don't really know what they will do with that money.  
Basic income seems like a more efficient solution to me.
@_date: 2018-07-25 17:37:10
Well then you've just been hacked, newbie!
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:41:37
How much do you receive?

It is tight right now but I'm expecting a hard pump soon.
@_date: 2019-09-19 23:23:21
Why too much?
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:23:40
You could read the bitcoin white paper, written by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. It's a bit technical though.
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:51:12

I just thought about that, it would be great if buses accepted bitcoin payments with LN.  
If you are a tourist for example, no worries about bus tickets or currency conversion. That's the future!

@_date: 2018-07-01 12:55:26
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:32:00


That's not true. You know why people come to that conclusion? Because some homeless people refuse to go to homeless shelters and prefer staying on the street. You ever been to a homeless shelter? It's hell man. It's overcrowded, there's violence, people get their stuff stolen...


How do you ensure it's equally distributed, I'm curious.
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:26:27
I need to accumulate some of that technology too, and then buy some coke and hookers with that technology

Friendly advice: do a minimum of research before buying a coin.  
I don't have time right now to explain the difference between BCH and BTC but if you want to have peace of mind stick with BTC.
