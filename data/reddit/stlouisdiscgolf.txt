Lol man I live in st.louis.... an hours drive from like 6 casinos.... if i had a gambling problem i wouldnt be looking at bitcoin for a fix. Im looking into bitcoin because its something that interests me. I would say that Im a level headed person who happened to use a coupke really bad (even says so) analogies. I appreciate the concern, as im sure there are people who have let hair brain schemes ruin them financially..

Not really complaining about my debt... I just have a goal to get out of it. And in no way does it involve dumping large amounts of cash in bitcoin lol. I jist used really bad and alarming analogies.  
  
What are the odds of them taking my house? Like meaning that I couldnt pay my mortgage? LOL thats funny.

Haha that made me audibly laugh out loud.

Mrs. Jenkins told me that the foot clan stopped using bitcoin and that's the cause of the crash. But I ain't one to gossip so you didn't hear that from me.

Yea, it wouldn't take much to cause major problems. If the laptop was on during the flood, or plugged in I imagine the HD chip is completely shit.

I agree with you, but in all reality how much sentiment could get inside the enclosure?

Maybe quit being a tightass then?
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:58:26
Huge balls sir. I have a small % going into coin, if the price drops anymore I might make a bigger 1 time purchase... but nothing that is going to rekt me financially in a full blown crash. If his goes below 50 for some reason, that's when I will start buying larger amounts. But once again this is just buy sit and hold coin.

Get into Gmail and search for bit. Then I'd have the family reach out to his college too

It really depends on what kind of risk your willing to take. You can pay a few grand for a professional job, or you could attempt to plug the drive into an external dock that you can get for pretty cheap.  
  
It just all depends, if you choose the dock route, I would leave the drive in some rice or silicone packets as long as you could. Even if the flood was long ago its a cheap thing to do that can't hurt. Also, if you choose to go the dock route, if you plug it in and its not accessible... try putting the drive in the freezer for a few hours. Alot of the times it will free up the pins and platters. Old trick that still works.  
  
Honestly you could probably find alot out by going thru whatever online records you can find on him. Forums Reddit etc etc...  
  
I wonder if there is a way to get into his email account, this would surely have bitcoin receipts or some kind of record.
