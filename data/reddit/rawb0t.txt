"request" and "secretly view" are two separate things. They absolutely _can_ request documents. How would they even _secretly_ view any documents of yours they don't have access to already?
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:30:13
Yes, I do. I also don't trust any of their claims after their latest bout of deceit and unprofessionalism. Either way, a hundred man hours is far from tens of thousands of man hours, as you originally claimed.

You can't even change the shipping address on a just-placed order if it's Bitcoin. I found this out the hard way. Wasn't paying attention, placed the order with the wrong shipping address, noticed immediately, opened up Live Chat, the best they can do is give me a gift card in 2-3 business days and cancel the order.
Your argument makes sense except for that.

what business is that incompetent?

Speaking of which, which of these hardware wallets is the one everyone recommends these days? And is there an ETA for Trezor 2? Is that supposed to be as awesome as I assume?

Which is why we're incorporating. :)

Looks cool but wouldn't giving it network access compromise the security of the wallet?

We'll consider this but for the most part we're just a content delivery service. I'm not sure there's room on our website to link to our personal pages.


Crypto comes to us (for address monitoring) and then forwarded to the seller after x (decided by seller, 1-6) confirmations. Can you give me an example of potential issues merchants may need help with?


Shopify is more expensive and a little more complicated. We keep things simple and are geared exclusively toward digital content.
@_date: 2016-09-10 21:49:16
no; he said *almost*. pay attention.
@_date: 2016-09-27 04:06:34
I stand corrected. Though the buyer would still need to download OB in order to do the purchasing, which they're less likely to do if you're trying to sell to the general public.
@_date: 2016-09-27 11:18:21
We don't currently have a way for people to browse products. Categories would be many and far between.
@_date: 2016-09-27 00:42:59
I understand your complaint there, but we feel 5% is fair considering the tools and services we provide. Upgrading to our Voyager package ($10/mo) reduces the fee to 2%. And those fees are only for Bitcoin/Perfect Money.
@_date: 2016-09-30 17:16:58
Are you sure they didn't own your email and delete the email so that you wouldn't see it?
@_date: 2016-09-29 15:37:47
I'm not sure it's fair to just accuse Blockchain like that.
@_date: 2016-09-27 11:16:08
and then installing it, running it, and using it to purchase things?
@_date: 2016-09-27 05:50:58
Oops, sorry about that. We'll get that fixed ASAP. In the meantime you can contact me directly using rob at rocketr dot net or you can reach both my partner and myself at support at rocketr dot net

@_date: 2016-09-06 17:55:58
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2016-09-27 01:22:17
Forgive me; I haven't actually used OB. It appears you have to download their program to even browse products there. That leaves you a much smaller audience. Correct me if I'm wrong, please.

1/2 a cent * 10,000 machines = $50/day
not bad for pure profit
@_date: 2016-09-28 01:59:27
Fair enough. If you change your mind feel free to PM me with any questions.
@_date: 2016-09-27 13:59:50
which part?
@_date: 2016-09-28 00:55:20
There is. We charge 5% of Bitcoin/Perfect Money payments for our free accounts. You can upgrade for $10/month to reduce that fee to 2%. We also process PayPal with no fee and Eth for .5% fee (Low demand so we just use Coinbase for Eth)
@_date: 2016-09-27 21:17:20
Somehow from the article I understood that you were handing out different parts to different people, requiring multiple people to get together to agree to load the wallet. That sounds awesome but is broken by point.
You didn't say that though so I'm not sure how I came to that conclusion. I'm guessing here but I think he came to the same conclusion.
Great article, though. Separating each word is a great idea.
@_date: 2016-09-27 12:18:01
That's a great suggestion. We'll look into setting that up

Not a lot of time left in 2016 but with the US election, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas all around the corner I'm expecting the price to raise a bit. I think next year we'll start seeing a lot more companies accepting it. I have a few projects I'll be marketing soon that all accept Bitcoin and I'm using one of them ( to help others accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-27 19:06:29
No, that's what I'm saying. Cloudflare (free and paid plans both) protects any site hiding behind them. They've taken a firm stance on it. Even illegal sites such as DDOS-for-hire sites.
@_date: 2016-09-28 13:22:24
Huh. I hadn't considered that but now that you mention it you're absolutely right. Thanks so much for the input. We're actually working on revamping the entire pricing system so we'll definitely take that into account for the changes.
@_date: 2016-09-27 01:42:23
Yup -- we're looking into all the options and hopefully will move past discussion and begin the actual process for it during this week. Thanks :)

Your company's working on it but doesn't have their own website to distribute the file from? ok
@_date: 2016-09-27 00:26:10
actually you don't. they run their own SSL on the front end (since your DNS goes through them, they're able to prove they're in control of the domain). from there you can leave it at that or you can (and should) have their servers connect to yours via your own SSL cert as well. You *can* import your own private key but for most sites it's not necessary IMO
@_date: 2016-09-27 03:32:41
Even if it did, most people won't be as willing to download it

Is your PayPal a student account? Because IIRC, if not you're not allowed to have a PayPal account.
@_date: 2016-09-27 12:08:12
We're sort of a payment gateway, though that seems to be more specifically defined as a service providing credit card processing directly. You still need to advertise and distribute your store/product URLs yourself using our service. What I meant was that on OB you seem to be required to download extra software to even view the products, though someone recently linked me to a site that lets you browse without the software. You still need to download the software to purchase though.

Fair concern. We're still looking at options for incorporation. Admittedly this started out as a project with just my friend and myself and we weren't sure how it was going to turn out. I'll expand with my answer to the next question:


That forum is where I got started with programming and where I met my partner. We're big names there and it was an easy market to saturate. That said, not everything there is illegal. Of course much of it is (no matter how much they try to pretend it isn't) and we're working on weeding out the bad eggs. It's a slow process because that's where our current success stems from and originally we were going to be much more strict right from the get-go. We're branching out our marketing (for example, we're now advertising here) so that we can finally leave those roots behind.


The .io admins are more strict than we'd like. From your previous concern to even disallowing porn (which isn't illegal or even borderline) and one of the sellers we're working on obtaining is a decently sized porn site. They didn't allow us to continue operating under a .io so we set up shop under a new name.

Man these extortionists are scum bags. Best of luck, guys. 
@_date: 2016-09-27 20:49:44
Public forums allowing for anonymity tend to do that. :(
Many people voiced genuine concerns which is great. I'd love to clear up any questions people have. But now people are making brand new accounts just to come attack me. They're likely either competitors or just people that don't get along with me. Or maybe even just trolls.
Either way, it's just part of the internet. Keep on keepin' on. :)
@_date: 2016-09-28 11:26:02
Yes and we also provide more services than they do. 
@_date: 2016-09-29 13:38:24


It's gotta go mainstream before it'll hit that mark.

We'll correct that on the site. Sorry about that!
@_date: 2016-10-01 14:44:29
Yes but my (and point is that they're still tracked. Every single transaction is viewable whereas cash is not.
I can go buy pot with cash and that cash can end up through several other hands before getting put in a bank or tracked at all whereas bitcoins are tracked on every transaction.
