What are you talking about? Have you ever read ANYTHING about economics? Initial profit doesn't even make sense as a sentence.
return on investment = (gain from investment – cost of investment) / cost of investment
In this case cost of investment = 0.
Gain from investment is positive as well in this , read the fucking thread.
That means that x/0 with 0&lt;x&lt;+inf.
In the 3 days it took you to reply you could have looked up the very basics of investments or calculus.

While arguing that it's arithmetically undefined...
No more comments, have a good evening.

that depends on x. if x is an invested amount (as in this thread), it can only be positive, thus using the right hand side limit.

To sum it up for you, a/0 is undefined because it depends on whether a is lesser, equal or greater than 0.
For the case of 0&gt;a&gt;inf (the case in this thread), the result is +inf.

Using basic arithmetic to explain a division by 0 is like using Aristotelian physics to explain string theory.
If you're going to be pedantic try to use knowledge that extends past highschool.

Dividing a variable by zero is undefined. Dividing a fixed amount as in this case is always infinite.

Calculus solved this a long time ago, buddy.
