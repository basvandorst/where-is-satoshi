Do let him know you have just won several millions on a lottery, but you need $20,000 to process the winnings and that you are ready to split the prize 50-50 with anyone who is willing to help. Additionally you should mention you are a son of the deposed king of Nigeria and that he has to leave the country with several millions and he needs some pocket change (say $20,000) for a plane ticket. Of course he will also split his millions 50-50 with anyone who sends him that pocket change. I already wish I could send you the money. Hey, you are Nigerian prince after all!

The guy who admits he doesn't understand technology and his friend.
In his 2014 letter to shareholders, Buffett laid out six criteria he applied to measure a company's fundamentals. One criterion is that he only invests in "simple businesses."
"If there's lots of technology, we won't understand it," he said

Sideways trading is also a possibility because the pattern was slightly closer to the left side.

Are you certain about that?

You can press those buttons and see what happens even without a game. It seems you make a proposal and your opponent can accept or decline. No btc is involved unless both sides agree. I don't know about gaming experience since I can't get an opponent. No automated pairing or nobody is online except me. Good idea but it will be hard to implement. Perhaps they should join efforts with some well established chess website.

What? Only 15k by the end of the year???

What do you mean what it means? It is obvious that the price is going up, just look at that path between the two blue stars in the lower right corner. Vertically speaking it is at the very center of the screen and whenever that happened it went up, except once when it couldn't go over a blue star, obviously. Whenever a price goes over a blue star we get punished from the elders of bitcoin.

We were at 14k and now we are going for the 7k. Halving.

It's BAKKT or FAKKT. Give them some time to justify the hype and if they don't, probability of going down is increasing.

It is not accumulation, but FOMO that might happen. Yes, 50-70k range precisely.

Volume is low near the end of the year so it is ideal time for price manipulation. If that is the case, it is also a good time for dump it on a whale game.

They wont. Unlike yourself they know the difference between privacy and anonymity.
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:03:27
Yes there is, but I wouldn't recommend it. You could give them access and kill yourself.

That article is not current. Check the dates of your news. Monero is the best privacy coin by far.
