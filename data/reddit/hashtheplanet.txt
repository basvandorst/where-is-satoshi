Yes, you would have slightly increased take home using BTC. More importantly you would minimize the risk of payment processing issues or the possibility of a charge back. Minimizing these risks can be much more valuable than the slight increase in take home.
As for the math, assume your client does not own BTC and you want to convert BTC to fiat immediately. Assuming that both you and your client are using fiat exchanges that take 1% such as Coinbase.com.
For this example BTC = $400USD/451.62CAD
Client converts $45,000 CAD into 98.644878 BTC (after 1% fee)
Client sends you the funds for FREE
You convert 98.644878 into $39457.95 USD
You send the funds to your account netting: $39,063.37 after fee
You will make 1% more doing this, which can ad up to quite a bit of an increase in revenue after many transactions such as this. You also eliminate any risk of payment issues. Once you receive the coins, they are yours.

It all depends on who you are in the market. Are you looking at it from a well established manufactures perspective, or being a regular consumer?

True. I also didn't factor in the 3-4 days that it would take for the client to purchase bitcoin from an exchange. The market can swing drastically in this amount of time. It could be for the better, but that is a large risk to take.

Are you looking for an exchange, or are you looking for merchant services such as buying in and cashing out?
BTC-e.com will allow you to trade until your heart is content, all for 0.2% per trade.
Companies that buy you in and sell you out such as Coinbase.com are restricted to FinCEN rules and regulations. They will always have limits since the banking system regulates their in and out transactions.

Thanks for the fast support John, but this is extremely disconcerting being we have 100% of your saftey systems in place, and they were so easily stepped around... on both of our company accounts. I understand that someone potentially could remote access a phone and get the 2FA code, but then why was their no email or text alerts?

Here is what we have come up with as a possible explanation. It shows that both Authy and Coinbase have  security holes to fill. Frustrating that their claimed full proof method lost us our BTC. 
Here is what we have found: Said hacker used a vulnerability in Apple's NFC chip to clone an iPhone via Bluetooth. Using data stored on the phone, access was granted into our environment. Once access was found into admin systems, Coinbase was accessed and everything was stolen.
Authy is the main entity to blame. A new phone, even though cloned, has a new IP address and a new MAC address. Authy should have never worked on the new phone... no exceptions
Coinbase is also to blame on this one as well. They should have logic to detect strange activity... such as a 2am log in or attempting to dump all coins when that has never been our pattern. Think about your bank: "Something isn't right: Whats the last four of your SSN, What's your mothers maiden, BDay, etc." They also shouldn't say their security is perfect without offering multi signature so that it takes muliple people to confirm certain actions. 
All in all, their systems need more improvements. Don't trust them in entirety.

There are a lot of mines in China that are getting crazy low power rates. You can still mine with an S5 and still make something if you have a low enough labor and power cost. Plus, it's a lot of work to unplug tons of machines that is still providing you with some profit. We are holding on to see what happens with the price and the difficulty. If the price starts to tick up or the difficulty drops, it's still profitable.
