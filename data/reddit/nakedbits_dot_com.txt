Did joe consumer care about automobiles when he was riding a horse? Did joe consumer care about electricity in the beginning? Did joe consumer care about the internet? Did they care about the iphone? NO... Joe consumer will benefit from bitcoin without even knowing it in the future. Nothing innovative/new is embraced by joe consumer... at first
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:34:00
You are correct, bitcoin is transparent, the state is not. The blockchain is a wonderful creation. Can't wait for others to figure it out and stop focusing on the price and volatility.

Seriously? what do you think will happen when the halving comes around again?
In all honesty, i wish it would go lower so i can buy MOAR!!! :)
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:41:14
hahaha me too

LOL, IKR... this was my response:    Unfortunately no... I don't get offers 2 b flown around t world. U r the belle of this ball. Accept!?
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:50:30
I agree with you, just wondering if gov't could incorporate their own blockchain/bitcoin system which they control, and force banks to use. that way they can keep an eye on everything

I am in the same boat as you (no cpu skills) and a few weeks ago I started my own [Bitcoin Show]( I luv doing it and hopefully it will grow, but for now the learning experience and creativity I get from doing it is awesome. 
I have also talked to many people on social media who ask me all kinds of Bitcoin questions, probably cuz I'm a half naked woman, but they still ask and I get to inform them. So that part has been great as well
@_date: 2014-09-06 16:41:14
such a beautiful piece of machinery
@_date: 2014-09-02 19:55:02

Nice, I just found a new background for my show. thx.

I was being sarcastic, this is what Matthew Driver was saying about Bitcoin last week. He said Bitcoin goes against the very thing they stand for ... transparency because it is anonymous and scary  
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:29:11
Then I assume you don't bank with the TBTF or vote for american politicians cuz they are all conmen operating freely. Amiright

uhhh... does anyone else see a problem here? 
Delain Markos &amp; Dionysis Zindros... c'mon these are obvious Bond villains, we are gonna let them create a "free and open market," yea ok. They are probably putting the finishing touches on their underwater lair as we speak. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 04:30:09
it's only a matter of time till wealthy/international business types  figure out they can do this. 
For some time now I have thought that international business and "wealth movements" would cause the next leg up.

What is it that Paul Krugman contributes to society? Seems to be a court jester to me (even looks like one). I don't understand how someone can get the big things so wrong - Internet, housing bubble - and gets to make a living giving his opinion. 
Will someone create an internet scorecard site for all these economists and talking heads, so we can give them a score on their calls and discard/discredit them with proof so we can get rid of them. This will provide a huge service to humanity, we can weed out the bullshit from the real and then people don't get suckered or persuaded into believing these tools. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:47:27

And of course Neil facePalmquist is all over the comment section. Seriously what kind of lonely depressed individual has to comment on something they don't like 50 times a day. Straight trolling all BTC articles. I can only come to one conclusion. He is a paid troll, if not he is the saddest person on this internet 
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:51:52

Yes I think another huge price increase is whats needed, not another merchant, especially one as large as Amazon. We need more hodlers :)

u diggin the grill piece aint cha
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:26:33
You are absolutely right. It's easy to forget what the rest of the world (outside of r/bitcoin) thinks. Just look at the comments for proof
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:03:20
Agreed, but look at my other comments for what I am getting at. It wouldn't be decentralized.
@_date: 2014-09-04 04:18:03
 well done, thanks
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:25:28
Ok so what if they use "crypto fiat" instead of bitcoins as the unit of measure? 
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:37:54
yes but the current one has lasted double.

this is gentleman (prob not tho)
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:18:48
Yes it is quite pathetic. I think these people actually are mad at themselves cuz they knew about bitcoin years ago, missed out on a huge fortune, and are hell bent to see it fail for justification of their own lack of vision and stubbornness 
@_date: 2014-09-21 21:32:01
"if they see demand" because it's so difficult to add it as an option... 
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:30:26
Yes, hopefully this will make more people wake up to it's legitimacy. But if more people don't buy and hold, or replenish their stash and just keep converting them, than the price will stay stagnant or worse. It's the chicken/egg problem... but this is still very positive 
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:53:55
unfortunately... most muricans

First... ask her to explain how btc is a ponzi, and then ask why the govt is selling a ponzi scheme back to the people and why red cross and united way are accepting ponzi schemes. 
then when it's all over and you are walking out tell her/him to eat a bag of dicks :) The entire bag!

yes I too am interested to see what the price will be come November.
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:35:02
Yes, isn't another large merchant dumping coin on the open market something that is probably not needed right now? Don't we need more hodlers? Don't you think another huge price jump would be more beneficial  than another merchant accepting? I don't know...
@_date: 2014-12-12 02:34:09
@_date: 2014-12-05 07:32:44
I agree with you, there is so much outright negativity to crypto for no reason. You don't like it don't use it, simple enough. I don't like a lot of things but i don't go around the internet commenting on them. Also 98% of all their arguments are foolish or uninformed. Then when you ask questions they never give you a straight answer, or divert it to something irrelevant. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:40:37
lol, u guys are 2 murch
@_date: 2014-09-26 04:46:12
Great question, especially since you can get your news from me    Lol
@_date: 2014-09-23 18:22:44
Is this big news? This seems like big news
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:43:13
You say they don't talk about it seriously, but do a lot of people know about it? What would you say (your opinion) the % of people that even know about it?
@_date: 2014-09-04 06:12:01
This seems very sketchy... I have never heard these people talk about this project or site. Wonder if it's a scam using their names???? 
How do you page users on here again?

 Anyhoo have a nakedbit for the laugh @_date: 2014-10-07 16:27:27
OHHHH, THANK YOU FOR THIS, now I get it. So if they wanted full control or eyes on everything they could have already done that, using bitcoin-like system wouldn't make it easier or cheaper to do. thx again

BitPay needs to get to the Doak for the National Champion Seminoles. Not to far from GA Tech and... they are NATIONAL CHAMPIONS!
I'm sure Jameis Winston would prefer to pay for his crab legs with bitcoin instead of forgetting to pay with fiat. 
And by "forgetting to pay" I mean stealing. lol 
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:05:27
I was thinking, maybe when they debate there can be an address set up for Eric and Ken. As they go at it people tip the points they like however much they like. The person with the most BTC wins the debate and they each decide what charity to give their wallet's to?? Just spitballing :)
With a live count of the wallets for the viewers, that would be kewl

Not really a startup, but I started my bitcoin video show, to entertain the community and "attract" doubters and skeptics. I'm not an I.T. girl, so I can't contribute on that end, just the entertainment side. But it's great knowing there are sooo many like yourself out there building the foundation to the future. So to you and everyone else like you.... I SALUTE YOU &amp; HODL :)
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:18:45
Thx, this is the discussion I was hoping for. What if the gov't makes crypto fiat and makes the banks use it? Would that change anything? There wouldn't be multiple blockchains just one that banks would be forced to use, but the issuance of coins would be controlled by central bankers???? How would that play out/what could that look like? thanx again
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:41:19
this was fun as shit... for 2min. thx :)
@_date: 2014-09-13 04:06:39

@_date: 2014-09-06 22:00:06
just to let you all know (in case you didn't read my about me page), I have been wanting to do this for a while. Just been waiting till I felt secure in my Bitcoin knowledge. 
Took awhile but I think I'm ready. Want to entertain the people that have taught me so much, and draw attention to crypto through the mystical power of breasts :)

this guy sounds butthurt... did Satoshi sleep with his mother?
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:21:53
I guess what I'm thinking is that the gov't would use parts of Bitcoin to make their own blockchain and force banks to use it, but be in control of the issuance. 
Which would (i think) make moving money around faster/cheaper as well as being able to keep an eye on the banks and citizens. IDK??
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:07:52

@_date: 2014-10-02 15:59:41
I can't wait till the markets/economy crash and the gov't comes after everyones money in some form or fashion, then you will see just how valuable bitcoin (the pretend currency) is... you snarky nobody

Hello fellow redditors, crypto-enthusiast’s, and trolls. I would like to announce the beginning of a show I’m doing. It’s a weekly video bitcoin and crypto informational/news show. It’s designed to keep you up to date on the weekly news, views, and events in crypto-land. 
I know there are already crypto news shows out there, but mine will be completely different. I was inspired to try something different when reading about Vitalik Buterin's Bitcoin Magazine model in which he would wait until he reached a certain bitcoin level before releasing the next article. I am trying something similar, a new kind of subscription model I’m calling proof-of-strip. As I reach certain subscriber levels, I will perform my show with less clothing, until I’m doing it completely nude. 
The subscription is only $1 a week, and I accept over 30 different crypto-currencies through coinpayments. 
My goal is to not only entertain but actually inform you of the weeks events.
I also think this might be a good way to introduce people to crypto that might not have cared or paid it any attention before, you know, until a naked woman is in front of them talking about it. Could be a good way to get crypto-skeptics to at least listen. Some of it’s got to sink in right? 
The show will start in 2 weeks, so if this is something you’re interested in check out my site and please subscribe. I made it cheap enough for everyone to participate. For the price of a latte you can get over a month of weekly crypto news.
So c’mon, use your bitcoins with a merchant that won’t cash them out to fiat.
All the details are on the site, so check it out and let me know what you think. This will be a new experience for me so any feedback is welcomed.
Come for the tits and stay for the bits! 
Your Bitcoin Belle
Also, has/is anyone working on recurring payments for crypto? I know coinbase offers it for Bitcoin, but you have to already have your coins on a centralized platform. 
EDIT - the show starts on 9/13
@_date: 2014-09-26 04:38:01
U knew about it then?? 
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:52:27
Are you sure they can't just centralize their own blockchian to make it faster/cheaper than their current system? Is this not possible?
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:44:10
I don't always spend bitcoin, but when I do it's on Dos Equis... and make-up ;)
@_date: 2014-09-17 16:23:22
Thank you so much, i really love doing the show, allows me to be very creative :)
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:32:53

@_date: 2014-09-05 05:20:27
And this post was just a waste of my time.
Bitcoin has hit mainstream guys, let's pack it up, time to go home.... 
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:39:29
It's the last part in parenthesis that matters, I really hope everyone is doing this.

Wow, this was such a great article. It helped me see the entire ecosystem in a different way. Let me ask you smart cookies, why don't more people use colored coins now and before? Does it have to do with blockchain bloat? Cuz this seems to be the clear winner(IMO) out of all these alts that keep getting created, unless I am missing a pretty big use case for them

can someone help me understand what a DDOS actually accomplishes?
@_date: 2014-09-07 01:38:58
your mom's a man...
@_date: 2014-09-05 14:08:45
This. Right. Here. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:57:22
so you are saying it's one (old way) or the other (bitcoin), i don't feel it's that black and white. i could be wrong but I don't see why a gov't couldn't start their own coin which they control and force banks to use. just so they can see the flow of money throughout the system (terrorism, laundering), keep an eye on citizens and much more. yes it would be centralized but that is what people are used to, but again idk

Yes let's make this happen. He was the main reason my light bulb got turned on :) Also why i've had him as my crypto-hero 2 out of 4 times on my show so far.
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:36:47
I agree but he has time to get his cronies and friends to join in for a good cause. He also said it was a good idea on the tweetbox... so???
Maybe have a paypal donate address and a btc address???
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:47:37
Yes me too. Let's hope people wise up. When I visit mainstream sites and read their bitcoin stories, even though it's not as negative as it used to be, the comment section is rampant with ignorance. It really frustrates me :(
@_date: 2014-09-12 22:21:05
still nothing :(
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:57:31
I know. Isn't that what you get when you take the currency off the chain?
@_date: 2014-12-16 06:27:16
I used to think that , but worse case we will just add more debt. I mean the world needs us to consume don't they? Isn't in everyones best interest to keep USA afloat? my 2 rubles
@_date: 2014-10-16 13:47:32
Wow that was more work and effort than Leah McCrackhead Goodman put into finding Satoshi 
@_date: 2014-09-02 14:51:58
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:39:28
I hope so fucko, I really hope so :)
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:38:16
I hope you are right. I too have thought  for a while now Argentina is a proving ground for crypto. 
Do enough people there have cellphones/comp tho?
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:05:24
yea about that... your welcome :)
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:09:57
So are you saying it can't be done? I'm not asking if this can be done to Bitcoin, but use a bitcoin/blockchain like system
@_date: 2014-09-05 20:48:32
Wowsers... thats a lot of robert di nero's 
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:02:52

@_date: 2014-09-06 20:26:23
I have been lurking reddit for months (this is where I did most of my learning). So it's possible I read that.
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:32:05
Seriously this should be all over the television
@_date: 2014-09-26 03:00:45
COMPLETELY AGREE!!!!!!!! 
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:31:34

@_date: 2014-10-26 12:41:30
That's why u should get my naked beginners guide. Entertaining and informative ;)
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:43:57
Red Cross now accepts illegal currency. When will the madness end?? 
I couldn't help myself...
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:37:26
I thought bitcoin was only anonymous transactions... I thought it went against the very thing they stand for. I'm lost
@_date: 2014-09-08 13:23:48
"Let me just say that I do believe that Bitcoin is probably one of the most amazing technological inventions in the recent history"....
.....so it has no real future.
Sorry you didn't become wealthy within 9 months... U just want instant gratification and reassurance with your investment. The upside is HUGE. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 21:37:35
check out my show, may help you learn... 
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:46:42
Oh good they don't understand it still 
@_date: 2014-10-13 15:32:53
I have added it
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:44:35
@_date: 2014-09-18 05:28:59
lol.. no but if my show gets bigger it's a possibility :)
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:04:13
I've heard this exact thing before from Andreas Aantonopolous. Nearly word for word 
@_date: 2014-12-12 05:16:32
uhhh fuck Jeffrey Robinson right in the ass... 
 I give the naked truth on bitcoin! Dammit!
I also did a review of his "book" 
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:07:03
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:21:07
Here's a reason why they care about crypto... Cuz it replaces every banker and financial institution if it succeeds. You want an example?? Give me your btc address and I'll show you. Troll onward and upward my friend
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:34:48
So true. Can testify. Bitcoiners... so hottt ;)
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:10:31
I think D is doing good things.
Who is D you ask?
Deeez butzzz!
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:20:10
It is but I don't have nutz 
@_date: 2014-09-13 15:55:46
First episode, hope it's informative and entertaining :)
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:03:16
just watch several times ;)
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:44:05
I agree, when people tip me, no matter how small, it lets me know they like my stuff
@_date: 2014-11-27 01:38:34
Yes just that line alone shows their lack of vision with anything that is or could be innovative.  I'm tired of people acting like if bitcoin didn't take over all payment systems/currencies in its infancy than its failed.  It's like everything in their small brain must go from 0-100... Real quick
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:04:30
This doesn't feel right... Something is wrong in the matrix. 
I guess it was only a matter of time
