Fast as I know it got delayed 3 times so far with a bunch of flimsy reasons that included they needed to download the bitcoin blockchain, and then it got corrupted so they had to redownload it then the API didnt work.

How does that affect the validity of anything? That is petty logical fallacy. People have a right to their anonymity.

Upvotes on reddit are meaningless, any XPY post has tons of manipulation involved since there is a lot of money at stkae.

The proof comes from the CEO. He claims that people will be able to buy at four and rich investors will come in and inflate the price to 20. That is what a ponzi scheme is. The coin is premined. It is hardcoded so people with specific private keys gain more PoS rewards. And they run all the infrastructure in a centralized way. It is a scam, its not a question, its just about trying to convince people to stop gambling one the gullibility of the community.

So you are participating in the ponzi scheme. You believe that new investors are going to pay for your gains. That is what a ponzi scheme is. It is not a question anymore if it is an outright ponzi, what is left to know how much mining was going on and how long this ponzi was being perpetuated.

There were others who spoke out before, instead of collecting profit from the scam then backtracking.
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:50:08
On the ball? They took profit then backtracked. Praise the people who stood up before the scam fell apart.

How is that the same as collecting money from a known ponzi scheme, with a 97% premine and source code that makes rewards higher for developers?

You don't see a problem with massive amounts of bitcoins ending up in the hands of scammers while markets profit from it and look the other way? You think this helps bitcoin?

Stop using Shapeshift, Bittrex and Crypsty until they institute basic quality standards.

So your solution is to wait around while they scam people so can know for sure that it was a scam. All the while you profit?

Well said, but at the same time not a reason to give up trying.

The part you quoted never included "and I believed them" and was more about illustrating that it was a ponzi scheme. 
Its almost as if you didn't read the post you replied to.

if they are 97% premined, have a built in system where developers get higher rewards than regular users, promise that future large investors will make the price go up and generally have a history of lying and being involved in ponzi schemes, you don't give them a platform. Its not that complicated.

They are not leading, people who spoke out before the scam were leaders. They profited and backtracked when it hurt their profit.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:31:59
So they should research the coin and only buy good ones but not research the market and only trade at good ones? Guessing you have affiliation to a market or gambled on these scams?

You are justifying yourself making a lot of money off XPY.
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:43:11
Suddenly people care about alt-currency exchanges in this sub reddit?
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:43:35
Well Shapeshift did back XPY.
