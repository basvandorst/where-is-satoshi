There is significant risk...
1: merchants would choose Bitcoin or crypto because it is an alternative fiat, but it takes an hour to settle on the blockchain
2: merchants don't care about who runs the network, they will choose a bank's version of the blockchain if it settles immediately
3: the bank can use the same approach that Shapeshift uses - convert real Bitcoin to Banker's Crypto to archive Bitcoin token backwards compatibility
Mike Hearn will do it for them.

Chomsky is lying as he is on video record as say... what difference does it make - who did 9/11.
Think through Grade 11 Physics... 49 floor towers (WTC-7) do not fall through path of greatest resistance straight down in symeterical collapse at free fall speeds of 7.4 seconds to total collapse.
Sure - I would be interested to see Obama, Bush for Prison in 2016. These people and their backers have killed millions. As I recall there are war crimes. It is only a matter of time before there is another show trial, like Nuremberg. The only question that remains is - who hosts the trial? 
Whose New World Order will it be?
If America hosts these trials, then it may be able to recover its 19th century stature. If they don't the empire crumbles and the Silk Road 2.0 advocates of Beijing to Berlin to Moscow emerge as the dominant trading zone.
Google - Pepe Escobar and Silk Road 2. No not the Drug trading website, but rather the trade route - Beijing to Berlin in two days by train... to Moscow.

I don't live in the US, if I want to use say, Kraken, then I must send Bitcoin to Kraken. Takes me a hour. If I want to arbitrage between the U.S. and Europe, then it more hours to send Bitcoin.
It is killing me.
I can send e-mail from here to Japan and back faster than send money in Bitcoin. Why isn't Andreas Antonopoulos talking about fixing the real problems with Bitcoin.
The point that is really unsettling is that, WE know that the &lt;Demon_Network_Whose_Name_Must_Not_Be_Used&gt; can send any currency including Bitcoin faster than The Bitcoin Network.
Burying this issue is just un-professional... and in the end THEY will win. Is the Bitcoin Foundation addressing transaction processing times?

Why doesn't MIT/Gavin produce and publish simulation models to substantiate the claim that 20 MB block size scales?
No armchair for developers.

Hi Ninj,
Thanks... for the comment...
But in drilling down, I do not see technically how the computational problem of ten (10) * N minutes, where N = 6, can be improved on.
The problem is two fold:
1: there needs to be sufficient CPU in the mining contingent to solve the cryptographic problem 
2: changing the Bitcoin protocol will require agreement amongst the miner's securing the BlockChain. Possibly difficult.
What I am really pushing in this discussion is for someone to correct me, or two, come to the realization that Bitcoin v1.0 is seriously flawed... and therein force the Bitcoin Foundation to deal with this question.
It surprises that Bitcoin talks always state 'fast' transaction times (Western Union can send money faster than Bitcoin fifteen minutes globally), when the Bitcoin speakers know that there are at least three (3) serious alt coin contenders where the transaction time is near zero. 
Ok, I will give up the debate.

I was referring to the Ripple Network, as the demon network. Demon because, Bitcoin people refuse to acknowledge the existence of Ripple.
This is just silly 'head in the sand' behaviour.

Hi whit slack,
iPads automatically replace some text tokens, based on history. They also automatically split some tokens.
Thanks for the clarifications.

Thanks Manny... that was informative.
So what would stop Ripple from eating Bitcoin's lunch?
I am a supporter of Bitcoin. 
The movement is important but there are serious flaws that need to be addressed.

Foxtrot could be used by the Telcos to replace 'pay as you go' cellphone voice and data billing. These networks are closed to the Telco. It would be a no brainer. They could cut their Accounts Management departments in half.
Let us see, if in six (6) months whether BitPay has venture capital from the telecommunications sector.

Because one confirmation does not give you control over the Bitcoin arrived or confirmed once.
The Bitcoin protocol requires that the 'longest' segment in the path be added to the BlockChain, hence one must await for other miners in confirming the solution, in order to add the latest 'block' (with the transactions in question) to the BlockChain.
@_date: 2014-12-10 10:32:13
Of course, I have... I takes days to send fiat currencies.
But that is not the point.
Ripple can send in near zero time.
For those that argue that you can spend after the first confirmation is just wrong, if you are not running your own software.

Think about it this way...
1: Bitcoin network and people do the heavy lifting with a 1.0 Bitcoin protocol and build global acceptance for the Bitcoin as a currency.
2: Once built non-Bitcoin network sets up operation and builds exchanges - on roads and off ramps
3: then non-Bitcoin network advertises that it can transmit Bitcoin and and everything else FASTER anywhere in the globe than Bitcoin v1.0.
Guess what the 'sheep' will do?
They will switch... and the core Bitcoin v1.0 establishments like Coinbase and BitPay, they too will switch and their merchants will never know the difference, as there will be address transformation in the non-Bitcoin network. 
This topic should be addressed.
So what to do?
@_date: 2014-12-10 01:36:16
Thanks - Titan and Piper,
I am thinking more about competing, say with, XCP and CounterParty in the example of replacing NASDAQ. And yes, I understand that XCP is currently using the BlockChain network, but they will switch as soon as possible, else give up the NASDAQ project. And yes, I understand that they could switch to side chains but then the Bitcoin miners may choose not to process these transactions.
The Bitcoin BlockChain technology simply does not compete in this NASDAQ space. More importantly it never will. The computational problem is an insurmountable issue.
10 minute transaction verification time is killing Bitcoin.
Everyone knows this.
So, what is to be done?
1: ditch the Bitcoin protocol? And use Etherium or that the &lt;Demon Protocol&gt; whose name must not be stated?
2: fix the BlockChain? Why isn't the Bitcoin Foundation dealing with this issue?

Hi Riplin,
Your comment about transaction processing time is disingenuous.
If the recipient can not spend the funds, they have not arrived.
@_date: 2014-12-10 10:58:31
Ok, so let us agree that there are two general types of use case lists.
* The first list is for applications that can tolerate the ten (10) minute transaction processing time. [I will set aside the confirmations problem.]
* The second list is for applications that must transact in say, less than 60 seconds, which by definition excludes the Bitcoin protocol.
My sense, is that users and service providers will choose 'systems' that are inherently faster.
So I maintain that the Bitcoin network has a performance problem relative to that of the Ripple network, and it is for this reason, that Bitcoin people refuse to reference Ripple, while they will state the names of other alt coins.

Hi Bell,
Yes you are correct...

Hold on, Gavin sought to undermine the release process. He can not be trusted with source code release permissions.
This has nothing to do with block size and everything to with trust while collaborating. 
If BitcoinXT had succeeded the source code be under the control of Hearn and Andressen, while Core developers would be locked out.
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:08:57
Antonopoulos does not have the temperament to be an employee. Head of security at any company is a full time job. It is well that he left the position as it could not be well served, technically.
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:58:08
Red Herring
The issue is not about Block Size.
The issue is about control of the software release process.
I would suggest that Bitcoin Core develop a strategy to by-pass the XT if the miners want increased Block Size.
The debate should be changed to reflect the real issue of control. Bitcoin Core could incorporate the same code and set the limit to be 74 %, so as to:
1: retain control
2: satisfy the interests of those who voted for larger Block Size.
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:13:29
I am curious about two points:
1: have there been any network simulation studies made with fees and traffic load and mining inclusion strategies. I have not seen references to this, and it surprises. This is not a developer problem but a system design issue.
2: why is Bitcoin XT being promoted over the MIT Bitcoin Core implementation. I have looked at the Git repository and it appears that since XT was forked in 2014 December there have been a large number of code changes (100+), way beyond the block size functionality. From a software development perspective why would Gavin appear to be throwing the Bitcoin Core Team that he works with under the bus... in favour of another competing fork. No one is given any thought to the additional functionality (code change risk) that would be thrown into the release stream by switching to XT. This makes no sense, and is unprecented in software product development.
3: what 'side deals' have been cut between Gavin and the XT people. Who benefits from such a switch? It would appear to me that MIT does not benefit, and yet they paying Gavin's salary. Absolutely priceless.

I too have a mathematics background... but this reddit. I remain surprised that technical discussions are pursued on Reddit.
The discussion should be in github.

How can anyone talk this slow both the interviewer and interviewee struggle to form a coherent sequence of phonemes. [If you are going to speak public ally think about what you are going to say; how you will say it; and who the audience is.]
Introduce to topic - before you begin.
This interview is a waste of time.
@_date: 2015-11-21 15:39:34
XT was never about 'the topic that must not be discussed', it was about controlling the software release process.

BitcoinXT - Hearn - Blocksize
The Montreal/HongKong conferences re: Hearn and XT have nothing to do with reaching agreement. It appears that Hearn/Andressen have gone to the folks that hold centralized wallets like Coinbase and convinced them to adopt XT earlier than January so as to pre-empt the January decision.
Hearn has made it clear that he wants to be a benevolent dictator - translated this means control. 
Why? Why now?
Hearn will have money - more money for developers either active now or after January 16. Bitcoin Core will have difficulty meeting the funding level for developers. I would suggest that there is an attempt to take over Bitcoin by a benevolent dictator and whomever is funding him.
More discussion should be focused on developer control and their funding sources.
Bitcoin Core should be seeking solutions that do not enable bifurcation of the Blockchain, such the Garzik proposal. After this, it will be a feature race which will require developers. Keeping Bitcoin Core open control will require the Blockstream Sidechains.
