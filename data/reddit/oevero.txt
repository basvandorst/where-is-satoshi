Bit it is not the end. People may transfer it right now but if it's accepted by more and more people, you don't have to transfer it in another currency anymore. 1 year ago there were like 5 shops accepting Bitcoin in Berlin and now it's around 100. I don't say it is hhe majority but an improvement

I use Btc as a currency but I can't speak for others. And yes you are right that is definetly a problem with Bitcoin but it is not like Bitcoin is a finished product. And yes you can't just abonden fiat money right now but maybe step by step in the future. To begin with Bitcoin was not meant to be the solution but a good start which could lead to a better solution.  As I have seen in other posts, the hype that is around bitcoin right now is more damaging than actually good for the cause. Now there are many monkeys acting like Bitcoin is the sole and finished solution and everybody should invest in it. 
Habe a nice day

First of all, thank you for the answer. It may be true that germany was less fucked like that, but I think that is not something that you should be able to do with a currency. If I owe you money, I shouldn't be able to just fuck up the money to get out of it.
Yes nowadays you can do it with gold but not at the time but I was talking about the past.

Ok sorry I thought you meant something else. But you are correct but the adaption is increasing everyday.

There are ways to use Bitcoin nowadays without fiat. See tenX for example

The reason why gold isn't used anymore is because gold is
1. Heavy
2. You can't split it easily
3. You can fake it
That is why they thought it would be great to have a currency that you can transport easily, is divideable and harder to fake -&gt; money it paper form was born. But why should people use this money? 
Because at the beginning that money was like a proof for you to posess gold. It was called the gold standard. In the 1920s the cantral banks world wide abandoned this concept meaning that behind the money was only the trust in people that others would accept it as "money". Thus fiat was born. Money was no longer bound to gold and it took 2 years for germany to fuck up big times with the "Reichsmark" and create a hyperinflation in 1922. 
I don't say Bitcoin is perfect and I think most of the people stating arguments in favor of the bitcoin here are also blinded and can't have a proper discussion but I also think the current system is far from being perfect and we should look for a better solution.
Btw i am german, so sorry for my bad english :p

I use a third party but if you argument is that the government would take away all fiat than nobody could buy anything and people would start making prices based on Btcoin or other crypto currencies.
I thought you meant they took away the cash

Thank you

I know but I do use my bitcoins in that way. Not the fiat money. The third party may transfer it to fiat but there is nothing wrong with it

Thats not entirely correct. The price is also going up because Bitcoin is deflational and there are only 21 million available. If everybody wants to have Bitcoin, it is sure to go up. I think at some point of time the Bitcoin will stagnate and when that time comes it is going to be a great currency. Also there are already countries regulary using Bitcoin. Korea for example. And the thing with security is that with bitcoin you have to care about security yourself and can't let a bank do it and I don't think this is bad. There are many ways to store them without them getting stolen. But in my opinion as you said, the bitcoin is not perfect (transaction fees) but it is good start.

And I can use Bitcoin with a Visa card so I can pay with it anywhere  they accept Visa
