Hello future millionaires! As bitcoin enthusiasts I thought you might be interested in my bitcoin related artwork! I recently finished my recreation of the moment from 2017 when “Bitcoin sign guy” held up his now famous “Buy Bitcoin” sign behind sitting Fed chair Janet Yellen on live television. You can view my work and purchase prints here:  I’ve even made it available on a coffee mug for those who need a little reminder each day!�� Just scroll down to see the purchase options.
If you’re interested in seeing my daily progress pics please follow me on social media. I also have drawings of Andreas Antonopoulos and Chris Coney, of The Cryptoverse YouTube channel fame, but they aren’t yet available as prints. If there’s demand I can make it happen.��

Not at the moment, but it would be easy to set up and create a product button for it. What size are you interested in? The original drawing is 9x12, so I’m not sure how big you could go before it starts to affect the visual quality of the print.

You can!  Scroll down a little for the “Buy Now” options :)

Lol, I like it!

I know, I know! I was waiting for that. In my defense, I’m a one man show, so I wear a lot of hats. I still need to educate myself on the technical know how of setting up my own BTCPay server. I refuse to use things like BitPay as it defeats the whole purpose of peer to peer digital cash. I do accept bitcoin, but for now you’ll have to message me directly to set up payment info :)

I’ll look into it and back to you! Thank you!
