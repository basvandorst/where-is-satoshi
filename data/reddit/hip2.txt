It's not really an exchange issue. It's the btc network.

uh no I'm demonstrably correct here, as shown by the fact that after years of debate of "how and when" to increase, btc still sits with 1mb. They're not increasing it. There is and was no intention to do so. seg2x debacle proved it as well. the ultimate proof of how right I am is the existence of bcc. If anything could've motivated them to get serious about increasing blocksize, it would've been bcc. Think about it...

and btc can?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:18:21
It is delusional to expect blockstream to go for blocksize increase at this stage. They've *clearly* demonstrated that is not something they want.

There is an as well. Be sure to inform yourself on both sides of this btc vs bch story.

It's the perfect storage of value system!
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:36:45
such heresy. where are the mods, we can't have facts just bandied about like this.

Because then we might be admitting the emperor is looking rather bare these days.

You seem rational about this... so what do you see happening? What solution do you expect blockstream to propose (besides LN) and how soon do you think it will drop? At what point would you say both the solution and its timeline are too little, too late?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:17:08
Well done on seeing the light.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:20:30
I had hope until the seg2x mess.

Is that really true though? In some countries it still has an illegal status. I would not trust the authorities in those countries to just leave you alone if they know you're holding...

Transactions fees will remain an incentive.
