Bitcoin investors are so desperate. Looking for any hope that their get rich quick scheme is going to turn them into millionaires.

With a triple monitor setup you can lose money 3 times as fast with cryptocurrency "investments".

This is a great indication that the price is not going to recover. 
If new "investors" were interested in buying bitcoin then they'd be searching to research it. But all interest has dissipated.

People buy bitcoin projecting the past into the future. They don't care about what they are buying but intend to sell that bitcoin to a greater fool at a higher price. That greater fool is also planning to sell to another fool at an even higher price.
Eventually you run out of fools and the whole scheme unravels as more people figure it out. 
Bitcoin is a negative sum game. One individual can only make a profit if someone else loses money after taxes and transaction costs(exchange fees). It is not possible for everyone to benefit, someone has to be the loser.

Everyone wants ETFs so that individuals can gamble with cryptocurrencies using their retirement accounts and end up working until they drop dead.

I'm curious how you decided that $4100 is a good price?
There are no fundamentals, cash flows, interest payments, profits, dividends, or anything to analyze. Essentially there is nothing to value. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:27:47
Yeah the fundamentals haven't changed. They were terrible before and they're terrible now. Bitcoin is bunch of 0's and 1's made out of thin air with no intrinsic value.

Hold on long enough and you can end up with losses.

The bitcoin promoters were the one with the false confidence. Many of them talked about retiring and buying lambos and yachts at the peak with delusions of being multi-millionaires.

Old timers like Warren Buffett will be proven right. These guys are battle tested and have seen all kinds of irrational investor behavior in their lifetimes.

They will always be in an inflation period. The supply is infinite and there is nothing preventing someone from starting new coins. That's why there are over 2500 cryptocurrencies.

Bad analogy. Stocks can goto zero and you can still profit. You are actually buying pieces of legitimate businesses that can generate profits with tangible assets that can be liquidated. You can profit off dividends even if the company is deemed worthless by others.
Bitcoin on the other hand has no intrinsic value, no profit, business, assets, dividend, interest, cash flow, or anything useful. It is made up out of thin air. All you can do it with it is hope to sell it to another person at a higher price. If there's no buyers then your investment is wiped out.

Buy when there is blood in the streets refers to a term used to buy stocks in the stock market. Stocks are tangible businesses that can produce a profit, pay dividends, and provide compounded earnings over time. 
Bitcoin on the other hand has no intrinsic value, assets, interest, dividend, or cash flow and you can only make a profit if someone else experiences a loss after taxes an transaction fees. It is a negative sum game. 
Interchanging the logic on a bad analogy will not yield a positive outcome.
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:19:23
It is called malinvestment. Individuals projected the past into the future and now are stuck with worthless assets. Their capital has evaporated.
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:57:15
Unfortunately there is a huge problem with the analogy.
Amazon was a legitimate business with assets that could generate a profit that enriched all shareholders. 
Bitcoin has no assets, profit, cash flow, interest, dividend, or anything remotely useful. No fundamentals or intrinsic value.
When you buy a share of amazon, you own a piece of a business. When you buy a bitcoin, you own nothing.
It is a negative sum game after taxes and transaction costs. You can only make a profit by selling bitcoin to someone else who experiences a loss.
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:00:24
Ponzi scheme. You buy it and hope a greater fool comes along and buys it back for a higher price. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:04:40
Loaded question. A better question would be why the price got so insane in the first place. Paying $19,000 for something with no intrinsic value makes no sense.

**Irrational Exuberance Trap**
When investors start believing that the past equals the future, they are acting as if there is no uncertainty in the market. Unfortunately, uncertainty never vanishes.
There will always be ups and downs, overheated stocks, bubbles, mini-bubbles, industry wide losses, panic selling in Asia and other unexpected events in the market. Believing that the past predicts the future is a sign of overconfidence. When enough investors are overconfident, we have the conditions of Greenspan's famous, "irrational exuberance," where investor overconfidence pumps the market up to the point where a huge correction is inevitable.

Yes. He warned me that I would encounter very little logic.

60% off is a Macy's department store price.
Bitcoin is still up 600% over the last 2 years and has much further to fall.

Sell at the peak, dump the coins on all the speculators rather than keeping them idle.

"How is that genius investment working out for you? Which color Lamborghini did you end up going with?"
"I drive a used Hyundai now"
"How can that be? I thought you were going to be a multimillionaire"
"Well, it turns out buying something and hoping to sell it to a greater fool at a higher price wasn't so smart. Who could have known?"

Most people don't care about bitcoin or the technology. This is just a get rich lottery ticket they bought into. As the price declines more people realizing that it is a losing lottery ticket.

Lots of people invested in dotcom stocks, beanie babies, pokemon cards, baseball cards, tulip bulbs, etc.
They all ended up broke.

Almost no risk for someone using a credit card. Easy to dispute transactions. Credit card issuer is liable for all fraud. 
Doesn't matter if someone gets your credit card number. 
In fact, the credit card issuers could easily stop the fraud but it's not worth it to them. They could require pins and smart chip purchases to verify every transaction. 
But they don't really care. They prefer to make the platform easier to use for consumers rather than locking down security.

Just saw someone posting to be calm because the infrastructure of bitcoin is so great. 
Hilarious... the infrastructure is being destroyed because it has no value to society. 
This is what you call malinvestment.

Not going to sink in. Bitcoin "investors" have deeply held emotional attachment to Bitcoin. The confirmation bias is so strong that judgement is thrown out the window. They are going to ride the bubble all the way back down.

Losing 80% in a year is the greatest store of value? Buying a new car and driving it for a year would have been a better store of value.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:31:06
Lmao, I wonder why credit card issuers had to block bitcoin transactions when the price was around 19k.
Surely those people buying bitcoin with a credit card could afford to withstand a 80% decline of bitcoin with their borrowed funds.

Why would you struggle to find a place to take bitcoin? I thought this was the future currency that was suppose to dethrone the US dollar and save everyone from losing purchasing power.

You are the financially savvy one in the family and buying into a speculative bubble? That is scary. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:26:07
Spending bitcoin? Everyone knows almost no one will accept bitcoin for payment. Too much volatility, you could sell something and lose 20% of your purchasing power before the ink even dries.
This is a lottery ticket people are buying in hopes of getting rich.

Yes nothing has changed. It was a bunch of 0's and 1's made out of thin air with no intrinsic value when it was ran up to $19000. Now that it has collapsed to $4500 it is still a bunch of 0's and 1's made out of thin air with no intrinsic value.

There's no need to use them for an online casino... bitcoin is an online casino by itself.

Bitcoin is digital fools gold. The HODLers will ultimately be disappointed just like the 1849ers that tried to cash in their pyrite.
