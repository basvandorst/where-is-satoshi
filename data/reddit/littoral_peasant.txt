Would be way better if they just did what Stripe does.
1. Send you an email about the refund process
2. Provide a way to input your own address -

It's called automation. Welcome to the 21st century.

Eh, let's not be too hasty with the word "bank."
@_date: 2014-08-17 17:17:21
What do you mean by "arm of Goldman Sachs"?

Circle isn't an exchange FYI.

I see what you did there o__O

Wouldn't a change suggest a misquote?

+1. 
Not to mention it's a free service. Go be more mad at banks or something.

Probably - though I don't think they've set any timelines for this.

I'd love to know where Circle says "everything is instant."

I don't really know what to call them either. You just gotta think about them differently. 
Does it seem like they want folks to short bitcoin? What does the platform suggest? What is the language that they use for the functions of their service? How does the UI inform their business attitude and philosophy? 
If you don't see something you expect on their platform, try to think about the empty space or feature-that-isn't-there as a deliberate business decision. 
Once they grow, perhaps then we'll have a better name for what they're trying to do.

Did you turn JavaScript off so you could complain?
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:38:25
+1 on this. Would be very helpful!

You want $2000 immediately fronted to you? How does that work?
@_date: 2016-06-03 11:55:39
This isn't new news. Idk why everyone's on Nick's dick about it. He probably just signed into his account for the first time in a while.

I'm not sure if what I'm describing addresses this. I am not a merchant, nor do I use Stripe. Thinking about it some more though, I wonder if they mean, the merchant can receive USD after accepting bitcoin? But again, still not sure.
The experience of paying in bitcoin should be no different than choosing to use a different card from within your wallet or purse during a sale. You shouldn't have to use a different denomination.
Maybe Circle can make that more apparent?
Also, how long did you test running discounts for?

In a similar way, I'm curious how to just find merchants (online and offline) who accept bitcoin. coinmap.org seems like a good resource. Are there others that are recommended?
