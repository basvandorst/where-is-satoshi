there are 6-7 billion people in the world only 1 million people own any bitcoin at all. India just opened up to it and Ebay is talking about accepting it. BTC is starting to show up on nasdaq and stuff. So Few people own any bitcoin that it has nowhere to go but up. Exchanges are learning how to do business and hopefully learning how to deal with the new types of attacks. we are ironing out the kinks right now. It has nowhere to go but up for the next 5 years at least. fiat is covered in fecal matter and fees it sucks.

I would maybe also argue that the older gold and silver metal coins we used actually had antibacterial properties that the Dollar lacks. I really Believe that Currency Is one of the Major ways for disease to Move from person to person. There was an article on here awhile back talking about how doctors didn't wash their hands between seeing patients (like babies and cadavers) When the doctors started washing thier hands the infant mortality rate dropped. It saved lives. We aren't just talking about Ebola.

I like the idea of Blockchains that have found a way to incentivize using their Hashing power to do scientific work like Gridcoin, Curecoin, and Primecoin. Then You could see coins Come about with specific use cases where some of their value comes from performing Services Government services, Social media services, AI Gaia Chains, Virtual Reality Metaverse Blockchains.

That is a totally good point and he did this in the previous interviews to. the reason that He is doing this kinda "soft" announcement is because it is less volatile. if you just were on ebay one day and paypal had everykind of crypto known to man in its wallet service then The price would go More vertical than it is already prone to doing; Followed by volatility which can be bad for different reasons. I think He is specifically avoiding that sound bite until it is ready. I noticed the same thing

I think Dogecoin is like a Gateway crypto currency because then the kids can Safely Learn about crypto currency. I just makes sense because it is like when you let your kids play with pocket change before you let them play with dollars and credit cards. (I'm not trying to pump Dogecoin Give me a Break But yes handing out bitcoin wallets with 0.0001 Bitcoin is Cool To Except that it is already lower than many minimum transaction amounts if you think about it)

from the site:      
What is e-residency?
An e-resident will be a physical person who has received the e-resident’s digital identity (smart ID-card) from the Republic of Estonia. This will not entail full legal residency or citizenship or right of entry to Estonia.
Instead, e-residency gives secure access to Estonia’s digital services and an opportunity to give digital signatures in an electronic environment. Such digital identification and signing is legally fully equal to face-to-face identification and handwritten signatures in the European Union.
The card is not a physical ID-card or even a travel document  because it has no photo on it, but it does have a microchip with security certificates. These enable the card to be used with a small piece of software installed and a reader attached via USB to a computer. It works on two-factor authentication. To get access to a service or sign digitally, you need to enter secure PINs which only you will know.
Why should I want it?
As an e-resident you can use and enjoy the same great digital services that allow Estonians to do anything and everything digitally – sign all documents, launch and manage companies, do the banking, encrypt files, etc.
For a closer look on how the digital way of life goes in Estonia, look around at this site: 
It is especially useful for entrepreneurs and others who already have some relationship to Estonia: who do business, work, study or visit here but have not become a resident.
However, e-residency is also launched as a platform to offer digital services to a global audience with no prior Estonian affiliation – for anybody who wants to run their business and life in the most convenient aka digital way! We plan to keep adding new useful services from early 2015 onwards.
How can I get it?
We will start issuing the e-resident digital ID cards by the end of 2014.
To apply for one, you need to make visit a Police and Border Guard office in Estonia – there you need to submit an application and provide biometrical data (your facial image and fingerprints) for background check.
The decision will be made in max. 2 weeks and if all is OK, the card will be issued to the applicant in-person at the Police and Border Guard office.
The one-time state fee for the card is 50 euros, other fees will depend on service providers – public digital services will be offered mostly free-of-charge, just like to ‘real’ residents.
We are working to add capacity to our embassies to process e-residency applications and issue cards abroad by the end of 2015 – so that you would not necessarily need to travel to Estonia to join us as an e-resident.
Life in the Digital Society
e-Estonia means voting in elections from the comfort of your own living room. Filing your income taxreturn in just five minutes. Signing a legally-binding contract over the Internet, from anywhere in the world, via your mobile phone. These are just a few of the services that Estonians take advantage of on a regular basis.
For their part, entrepreneurs can register businesses in as little 18 minutes, check vital company, property and legal records online, and even integrate their own secure services with the ones offered by the state.
Interaction among government agencies, and between the government and citizens, has been completely transformed in e-Estonia, quickly making bureaucracy a thing of the past and making the running of all levels of government more efficient than ever before.
The e-Estonia section of this website details the methods by which Estonia is using advanced technical solutions to create a stronger economy, a better community and a brighter future.
Estonia’s e-solutions have resulted in:
An unprecedented level of transparency and accessibility in government
Safe, convenient and flexible exchange of private, government and corporate data
A healthier, better educated population with easy access to social services
A prosperous environment for business and entrepreneurship
Digital society and infrastructure
The e-Estonia digital society is made possible largely due to its infrastructure. Instead of developing a single, all-encompassing central system, Estonia created an open, decentralized system that links together various services and databases. The flexibility provided by this open set-up has allowed new components of the digital society to be developed and added through the years. It’s that power to expand that has allowed Estonia to grow into one of Europe’s success stories of the last decade.
TLDR Watch the video Estonia has its shit together

I recommend any new person to start into cryptocurrency with no more than 10$ dollars because people are prone to mistakes. I sent 23$ of dogecoin (doge)  to a Digitalcoin (dgc) wallet on accident and I will never see those coins again. It is easy to copy and paste the wrong address.  I reccomend coinbase to connect to your bank account. it is solid even though it takes a few days. otherwise I think you can get it from btc-e with visa mastercard. or get buy some on ebay people make bitcoin wallets then send a specified amount to that wallets private key then you just buy the whole thing. of course you should probably move it to another wallet when you get it to make sure that the seller didn't keep the private key.   hey just post your address and I'll send you a little bit of anything you want just to get started

I Sent dogecoin to a Digital coin address. sometimes with multiple accounts open I start copy pasting stuff. It is easier than warm butter to make a mistake. please double check everything everyone. If you are new to bitcoin start with 10 dollars to be safe until you understand what you are doing.

They say 21 million but each one can be divided to 8 decimal places so technically the smalles amount is a satoshi at 0.00000001 But in reality lots of Places won't let you Move that Dust around meaning the smallest amount is dependant on the minimum amount required to send it at whatever site/wallet you are using. for instance I got a bitcoin tip for like 75 cents but I can't send the stupid thing anywhere

Gold and Silver are Antibacterial Metals. Bitcoin is also Germless. You can make colloidal silver medicine by connecting two pieces of silver to a battery and dipping them into a glass of water. it causes some of the silver to get into the water which is really good for your body (and sick cats) naturally we would have small amounts of metals in our body. we would naturally have more gold and silver in the environment if people didn't Hoard it. Our bodies are lacking small amounts of precious metals. Silver also has interesting Magnetic qualities
