Kraken should absorb the remaining GOXBTC and offer to pay out a high as possible percentage to creditors who register and verify at the Kraken exchange. In return for the massive work this would require, Kraken would benefit massively from such a huge addition to their client list.

Here are some ideas I can come to think of:
* Your payment to Reddit for viewing this page.
* Your payment to Youtube or the content uploader for viewing a video.
* A payment to you by upvote on Reddit.
* A payment to you by LIKE on Facebook, Instagram.
* A payment to a router for routing traffic.
* A payment to a DNS server for handling a request. The DNS server then pays it's own electricity bills.
* A porn star getting her revenue through views on Porn Hub. 
* Donations per download to freeware.
* A payment per song on Spotify or Soundcloud.
Passive tipping for the things you enjoy, enabling content-makers to sustain themselves, electronic devices such as DNS-servers to run themselves.

Yeah. I bought a hotdog with swish. A friend on the other  side of the country called me up and asked for 200 SEK when he was in the waiting line to buy a jacket and I owed him. I was able to send the downpayment through Swish for a motorbike when I was on the phone with the salesman (I even texted a friend and he swished me a few SEK that I was missing, all in the middle of the call!). How long would it take to send with bitcoin?

no they don't. nodes do.


no, only valid blocks are bitcoin, and nodes decide this.

LN is multi-hop.
Anyways, why are you comparing this to Venmo? You should compare it to Bitcoin Layer 1.

Nah, almost all of what you said is incorrect

I just saw "Intro to Bitcoin" video and it says that Bitcoin uses encryption. What exactly is it that Bitcoin encrypts? I think the right word is "cryptography", as hashes and signatures are subsets of cryptography, whereas encryption is yet another subset separate from those.

We'll just have to see if a 51% attack happens and then I'll get to say I called it.

You're right. This was probably the worst theory ever.

Then maybe it's a James Bond villain.

That wouldn't kill bitcoin forever.

Syre, in your case this works. But Western Union will still be around for those times you lose everything abroad (my current situation).
