This article is a mess. There's some anecdotally interesting stuff in there, but even the basic premise shows a complete lack of understanding of several of the underlying subjects.
- The basic premise that postdated cheques don't exist in the western world is completely false. They're everywhere, used for everything from rent to bill payments to supplier invoices, etc. It's extremely commonplace for a landlord in North America to ask for a full year's worth of postdated rent cheques in advance.
- Cheques aren't money. Nobody is "print(ing) their own money"
- Passing someone a cheque does not "create" economic activity of any kind. The activity has already happened somewhere else, or will happen at some point in the future, or there is none (a gift)
The premise of the article relies on assuming that the blockchain is just a ledger. If that's all it was, then bitcoin would be a non-starter. Simple ledgers exist in untold variants, and address very few of the issues that bitcoin does.
- Bitcoin does, in fact, allow for the creation of new money. This cheque-passing process does not.
- The above shows a comflation of the blockchain and Bitcoin. These are not one and the same.
- No, no, no. A businessman can not create money out of the blue.
Ok, I'm done now. It just doesn't help to have incredibly confusing articles out there, especially on sites like Medium which are perceived as being of higher informational quality than many other "random" sources.
