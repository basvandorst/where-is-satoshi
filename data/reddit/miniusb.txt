it's how the code is compiled in Xcode. no way around it, really.
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:02:58
this is not going to end well
i am so sorry for tigerdirect support
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:56:42
Try telling that to the account holders of people selling Bitcoin related shit...
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:49:48
So since it can be prevented, will it be prevented?
@_date: 2014-01-26 03:26:59
North American Bitcoin Conference
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:32:36
what's so private about it if it's on the block chain?
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:30:03
oh, I get it! but how does it know how many bitcoins you have? is that just included in the qr?
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:46:50
lol do you want them
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:08:57
I don't think you needed to /s that joke, with us being on reddit and all...
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:04:05
it's just that whenever I ask a legitimate question here I seem to always get downvoted and hated on for it...
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:16:32
let's see how fast Apple removes is this time
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:49:25
Short answer: No

The iOS wallet is [absolutely horrid.]( It doesn't even fit the iPhone 5+ screen (the majority). They mentioned on their twitter an update is coming some time in 2014.
@_date: 2014-02-02 23:06:13
I asked Coinbase and got [this]( Even though it's perfectly legal...
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:35:38
holy shit i'm fucking sold
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:03:53
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:29:55
an extremely long and satisfying-sounding note 
@_date: 2014-01-23 05:32:08
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:54:44
blockchain app is being updated soon... 
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:06:13
not if you're locked into a contract, i'm waiting for mine to end
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:19:14
what's wrong here? seems fine
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:33:04
all I have to say is a huge thank you to TigerDirect for making other tech companies notice
@_date: 2014-01-02 05:58:56
how much have you made?
@_date: 2014-01-28 13:13:47
Probably got pulled
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:04:19
sorry, meant deflation
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:50:47
then use that, not a debit card
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:45:53
While I do understand this, when I contacted Apple about the removal of Coinbase from the App Store they told me to use Blockchain.
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:53:10
so ~~is~~ was the point of bitcoin to show that something like this can be created?
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:38:12
Email coinbase and ask for a manual selling of your bitcoins to make sure nothing goes wrong.
@_date: 2014-01-02 05:55:26
alright. thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:55:20
you may want to spellcheck your ToS :P
@_date: 2014-01-20 16:50:24
(sorry for noob comment)
Won't Bitcoin eventually have inflation when we hit the 21 or so million that can ever be mined or is that suddenly not a problem?
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:59:13
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:54:12
or kraken, I hear good stuff about them
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:49:43
It's not "4chanman". 4chan's public "face" is that, the "anonymous mask", which is really just a Guy Fawkes mask.
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:20:52
oh god, i didn't realize... i meant to say wallet
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:34:32
why did you need to link the wikipedia page for cydia? lol
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:07:59
What do you mean? This is just as close.
@_date: 2014-01-21 14:01:02
Sorry, thought you were talking about Bitcoin in general. :P
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:49:11
No, use a bank account
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:20:10
That's awesome! Is it actually legal?
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:47:32
I volunteer to video edit (sony vegas 12 pro), script and maybe some concepts. do you have a skype/steam or something else?
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:31:22
I used to LOVE minifigures. Your friend has a new customer.
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:32:03
yeah, my dad was stuck in that plan. he had bought the second iPhone after it came out, and he had an unlimited plan. he really wants to make the switch, but doesn't want to lose unlimited (it's also pretty cheap for unltd.)
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:52:35
You can't install apps from outside of the App Store without jailbreaking unless it's a webapp
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:52:48
agh fuck i didn't want this
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:20:23
but if it's just paper, where are the bitcoins actually stored? in the QR code itself?
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:13:18
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:01:28
@_date: 2014-01-21 06:14:46
this. you can get block erupters for a pretty cheap price, but you definitely won't make money with them.
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:37:03
yep but the mods don't seem to want to do anything to this conspiritard
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:09:47
the real satisfying thing about that website is when a block is found.
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:11:07
just look at OPs history...
this post means nothing and has no relevance
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:37:16
If you only need that much is probably worth a shot.
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:41:58
this. if you truly are completely fucked over with an iPhone, coinpunk is the way to go. for those who don't know, it's a full-powered Bitcoin client webapp that includes QR scanning. it's pretty swag.
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:31:32
Why is the page title "Covecove"?
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:15:45
Doge is based on a meme
Memes die
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:24:29
Every chrome extension works on a chromebook lol
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:45:47
I meant no way around it for the user. I use it on iOS7 (jailbroken), works pretty good.
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:16:23
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:07:17
honestly the only one worth holding is Lite... Doge is bound to fail soon, and Lite actually has some potential 
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:09:05
if only they had researched :(
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:56:50
That looks pretty good actually... though I might want to use more of a mainstream exchange
but hey, I'll take it for now
EDIT: hm, only able to spend $100 per day? that's kind of sketchy/weird
EDIT 2: only australia! damn it!
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:54:01
What is this like I don't even
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:55:30
I think I might also have been downvote botted, I got 2 downvotes after 20 seconds of posting
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:34:00
who manufactures them?
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:33:05
It's AU only
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:43:18
Are you sure? When I tried to sign up it was asking for a country, and Australia was the only one on the list.
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:46:52
I've got iOS7, no jailbreak for it yet. But a kind redditor solved the problem by telling my to switch to Coinjar, which has an iOS app
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:01:33
I just downloaded it and it worked. Thank you so much.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:54:49
Yep. But you can't scan QR through it, can you? Or make real purchases?
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:04:19
never mind i read it wrong
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:00:12
huh? sorry, the joke went right over my head
explain pls
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:30:28
So for example RedLaser, I scan the QR with that, copy the text it outputs, but where do I put that?
