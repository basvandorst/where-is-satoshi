Dude the real problem isn't the Bitcoin, Bitcoin is actually the solution for many problems, including freedom, the problem here are the governments who want to criminalize it, as nations we should adopt it massively, and stand against those who supress the freedom.
Bitcoin is freedom
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:44:30
Exactly, well, to us, Bitcoin is a gate for freedom, more than a way to become millionaire that many people think as you say.

You didn't read the whole post, did you?, i'm not asking for particular donations/charity (It's ok if someone wants to), but no, we want a startup, that's why i'm talking about GoFundMe or any similar, like Kickstarter, which aren't available in LATAM, i'm looking for help to make a formal crowdfunding, for our company.
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:03:10
The problem until now is that none who's reading and commenting the post is that "chosen one" we're looking for to trust and work with us on the crowdfunding/investing platform for our company to make a verified and trustable process for investors (or donors) in order to get enough to move with all the people outside Venezuela ans start over, which we're not able to use from Latam (GoFundMe, Kickstarter, etc).
Still searching for him/her.

An example, we could be in a worst situation if we were expropriated and the company money was in the bank.
Bitcoin: 1 - Banks: 0
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:41:34
???? What the.... ????
This isn't propaganda, our case, as many more happens because of suppression of freedom, by the hand of authoritarian criminal regimes, in this case is the left.
If this happened in a right government, i would still critizite it, you can't criminalize Bitcoin.
Btw, i don't support Guaidó, he's a Cuba's puppet, socialist, populist, just giving fake hopes to the people while they make business with the regime.
Links are reddit links, pictures of our T-shirts, wtf?
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:29:29
Indeed, we use VPN most of the time, but Tor is a good idea too, thank you i'll start to use it
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:48:00
Really -\_-

That's the thing with the socialism, it never keep individual power of politicians in check, indeed they always become more powerful, is their basis.
Socialism always looks great, and is seductive as fuck, once you learn it, know it, feel it, and live it, you realize how bad it actually is.
I've read tons of books both about left and right, when we talk about the simple basis about both, in my opinion based on what i've read, the left is always less free, at the end it supresses the individual freedom, so the collective freedom, so there's not well-being.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:13:35
Bro... If you want you can personally call us, we're... Not... US State Department, what the actual fuck... ¿¿¿???
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:01:58
Indeed, the bad situation is even since Chavez, before the sanctions, and the sanctions now are for particulars, there's exceptions about food/medicine/supplies commerce and transport.
Yes... We have a lot of work to do, leave Venezuela is the best idea now.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:04:49
God, you again, really?
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:49:54
Dammit, ok boy you got me, as you say, i'm a CIA agent being paid by Trump to make propaganda against maduro and guaido.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:14:38
Thank you! We'll keep it up.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:53:41
I would have loved to... But we're more useful being alive :)
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:34:17
I can responsible tell you 95% of Venezuelans would agree with my statement, anyways, keep it peaceful, we're just trying to start over our company which adopted Bitcoin. 
Have you seen a textile manufacturer company accepting and paying their employee with BTC before?
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:06:27
I choosed my nickname because of a videogame long time ago, my real name hasn't any "Y" or "I"
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:31:57
Yep, that was the first time i made my reddit account, for the DGB giveaway, and also that guy's crazy giveaway, after that I didn't see it necessary to use reddit and i was working most of the time, until now.
Not hacked, just away from here.

This is a Bitcoin post, political topic is just a consequence in this case.

You need to see a doctor.
@_date: 2019-08-28 13:51:36
We're not, you can ask for a particular proof, i'll upload it, or if you want to directly talk to us, that's ok too.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:51:58
What is wrong with you?

How can i prove i wasn't hacked? 
And sure! I'll DM you, we'd love to sell you a T-shirt.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:07:33
The root of the whole topic is the use of bitcoin, and what happened to us
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:37:45
Interesting, didn't know about that i'll take a look right now, thank you.
But i'm still not sure about posting a wallet, some people can misunderstand the post and our message, that's not the idea, we want to keep it professional and raise this project in a verified way at some platform, before being pointed as "scammers" which we're not.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:56:52
Well... Yes
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:16:50
This isn't propaganda, also elections here aren't free since Chavez, the media says the contrary but we know the truth, here, inside, we the Venezuelans, and personally i actually don't support socialist Guaidó.
  
This post is: Economical problems =&gt; Bitcoin adoption =&gt; Government criminalizes Bitcoin =&gt; Our case.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:59:15
Sure! I'll dm you right now, and that's a good idea, the less we want is to be robed again, we must protect the funds
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:31:08
That's true, but this does not happens in all countries, some are free.
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:27:45
Nope, bitcoin is the solution for economic problems, sometimes caused by politics.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:56:34
I really believe that if we overcome this one, we will be unstoppable.
"Every cloud has a silver lining"
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:29:40
On contrary, he's been grateful all this time with the idea, if this country was free, this would be the ultimate grow for the company.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:57:37
Indeed, if you read the whole post we're thinking on emigrate.
now, here the only and easier way to money manage is cryptocurrencies, if we get enough funds to get out of here, we'll probably take the Bitcoin with us and cash out in Colombia to finally head to Perú, once then of course we'll need to open accounts in local currency and cash out BTC to start up the company, pay and spend. After the company is working again, we'll keep offering Crypto adoption, but as always and as everyone... We'll use Fiat in any moment.
Bitcoin is our alpha and omega now.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:04:01
Again, US sanctions against the regime started with Obama, we're fucked up since Chavez, do the math.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:04:20
I'm not US State dep, what the hell dude
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:48:04
Wait, i got lost in the conversation, you're telling me we should keep using Bitcoin to save our Venezuelan asses, or not?
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:11:10
Those seven individuals are part of the regime.
What collapsed Venezuela's economy was the government itself starting with Chavez, he started to fuck up everything.
They robbed the nation's funds, exactly.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:03:09
US sanctions against the regime started with Obama, we're fucked up since Chavez, do the math.
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:37:21
Hahaha, nah, just don't support authoritarian criminal regimes in your country, stay free :)
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:15:31
Sure! Dm sent
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:29:31
Just sent u a DM buddy.
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:46:27
Exactly, for our luck, the company funds in BTC were not in my phone, we would be more fucked up right now.
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:04:53
Don't believe me, DYOR, ask Venezuelans, make a social media poll, idk, and then you'll tell me i'm right.
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:36:00
I think is a bad idea, isn't it?
@_date: 2019-09-03 03:49:35
Update: I arrived Peru, saturday 31/08 my laptop was robbed and we were threatened. Called a couple contacts to manage to head to Perú.
We've been talking (Company people), we're all feeling this isn't gonna work,  everyone will probably end up just figuring out how to leave Venezuela, do it, and start working whatever we can. Making a company in any country is expensive.
I'm feeling depressed about everything happening, the company is gone, everything is gone, and let's be honest, none is going to invest in this company, textile manufacturing isn't anymore profitable in other countries, everything is from china, importing is everything now.
This is lost, i'm gonna try to find a job, and keep helping our people to get out from Venezuela, the company will keep working with the 3 remaining machines, until everyone is able to leave the country.
Thank u everyone for your good wishes, but, this is over.

It depends where you do it...
