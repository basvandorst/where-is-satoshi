This  had already been proven to be a straight up lie

Imagine being a bear in a bull market ��
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:16:02
Oh no. An ascending wedge....
@_date: 2019-07-15 10:56:47
Time to accumulate
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:49:53
I believe they call it consolidation.

Remember when we thought being over 9000 was cool? Felt like it was only a couple weeks ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:28:55
Mom's speggeti?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:19:20
People who bought over 1000 said the same thing a few years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:40:54
Please let this happen. I would buy so much.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:06:31
 The "ideal" strategy is unknown and anyone who says they know what it is, is full of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:13:00
That's what everyone won bought it at $1000 said a few years ago. They aren't saying that now and neither will you if you hodl.

When CNBC says buy I sell, when they say sell I buy. Easiest way to make money ever.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:34:23
It use to be you buy something and you make money. How it's you short anything and you make money. Thank God for Bitmex.

I guess fuck the moon, BTC to Mars!

You got to remember BTC itself is a great invention, Mt. Gox is the failure here. If anything I believe this may be a great opportunity to buy low, though I wouldn't buy just yet. We may see a few more crashes before this is all over; however I do believe BTC will be much higher then it currently is in the long run, there are still many great companies such as Bit Pay in the BTC economy.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:17:41
IF Gox gets their shit together and allows BTC withdraws everyone is going to instantly withdraw all their coins and Mt. Gox will have to go out of business, the only thing they could blame in the end will be their selves.

I learned the same hard lesson a while back. Lost 8 bitcoins from it. Always got to protect yourself, people suck.

LINK and BNB are doing alright. But ya, 99% of alts are dead.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:52:19
Haha yes
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:53:33
There is Hidden Bullish Divergence on the one month chart between the low of this bear market and the previous. This signals continuation of the greater trend which is up. I look at the month when I want to feel happy. :)
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:58:02
Everyone shorting had their stops around 4200 since shorters weren't expect us to make our first higher high since the bear market started. When everyone's stop is in the same place, guess were price goes?
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:13:40
I guess everything is ok then, back to the bull market!

If we ever return to our ATH these prices will be amazing, even if we drop back down to 1k. I am hoping for a long accumulation phase so I can hoard as much as possible for the next bull run.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:58:22
People said that when it went under 200 in the last bear market. Good thing  I dont listen to those people.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:55:56
Its buying season. Not all at once of course, I think we go lower, but it's a good time to start laddering in buys. Remember app the times you said you wish you could buy this low? Well your wish has been granted.

Now with Ron Paul on our side maybe the other skeptics in the liberty movement will follow. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:49:45
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:08:05
Or by shorting
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:06:24
We have already won, now its just a matter of time.

Figured it out, just wasnt working on firefox. Chrome works though
@_date: 2013-12-22 11:57:13
Wow, I actually just found it in my deleted folder. So I guess the hacker managed to get into my e-mail as well even though it has a different password. I guess I don't have a chance at getting them back now...

BTC is a beast
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:13:04
Negative interest rates on deposits? Fuck that, give me BTC!
@_date: 2013-12-22 13:21:46
I think your right, thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2013-12-22 11:54:53
I had e-mail authorization on for withdraws, I made a withdraw a couple weeks ago and had to verify through my e-mail, which uses a different password. No e-mail was sent this time. 
I don't use this password on any other site
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:34:12
Screw that, we're going to Jupiter at least
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:15:43
With the limited supply and rapidly increasing demand this is highly unlikely, more so in the long term
@_date: 2013-12-22 11:47:38
If Bitcoin wasn't so volatile right now they wouldn't be there. You aren't helping, please kindly stfu and let people with some insight respond to me.
