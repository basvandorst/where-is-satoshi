Fair enough.
The attacker's only hope might be trying to somehow derive a new rangeproof for the modified change amount from the old one by exploiting additivity (amount + delta)\*H = amount\*H + delta\*H, but I expect the rangeproof construction is nonlinear, and this won't work.

The modified amounts are still within the [0, 2^64] range, and the rangeproofs are still valid, aren't they? No overflows, no negative amounts, just a small addition to the recipient's output amount and equal subtraction from the sender's change amount, the delta is strictly less than the change.

can the recipient manipulate the amount b? If he wants to increase it by delta, he could increase the commitment of his own output by delta\*H and subtract delta\*H from the change commitment he received from the sender. After this modification, he receives more coins, and the sender receives less change, while all validations still hold, or am I missing something?
In all other electronic cash systems I am aware of, the signing party is the sender. This scheme makes a surprising move by shifting the signing responsibility to the recipient, this made me think it can be abused by the recipient.
