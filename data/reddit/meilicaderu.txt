what is with all the hate on two bit idiot? he was the one that exposed mtgox cover up.
two bit idiot is giving them a chance to gracefully step out.
it sounds like to me that we have a lot of bitcoin bagholders here.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:14:04
we need to first ban these bitcoins. why should we build the value and allow mark to still be able to dump/profit?

Mark wants your passwords now.

And it's down again. 522 error.
@_date: 2014-03-19 07:58:29
down again.

i remember when i pointed out the problems with mtgox in 2013 and all you mtgox lovers were dicks and chastised me. i feel bad that people lost their money on mtgox. you must face the fact that mtgox is not coming back and mark karpeles screwed you over. he is running off with your money and you are angry at the wrong person.

Our forefathers would balk at the amount of taxes we pay today. It's depressing.
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:08:39
DDOS IRS with fake tax returns! Come on guys!

1. Chinese currency crunch. They are selling everything to get cash to pay off creditors.
2. Mtgox. They dumping coins.
3. Mtgox. People don't feel safe putting money in exchanges.
4. Fear of China's Bitcoin ban again
5. Colombia Bitcoin ban

1. crappy customer support
2. blames their shortcomings on bitcoin
3. knows they are not solvent and continues to allow deposits
4. makes up investors that will bail them out
5. deletes everything to hide evidence
you still think he is under a gag order and still has your coins?

nothing so revolutionary. what is this old school forum software?
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:13:07
There are no Gox thieves. Mark Karpeles stole the coin himself and sold your data.
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:40:20
mtgox coins that we know about are not on the move - even though they tried.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:50:32
im just shocked. mtgox stole your life savings and you guys are not doing jack. there were only 2 protestors in front of the mtgox office?? you ALL need to go to japan and demand Mark's head. WTF ARE YOU ALL DOING? PUSSIES?
@_date: 2014-03-09 08:41:19
If it wasn't for twobit, you would probably still play along with this charade. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:41:55
Mark is a sadistic liar. He is not even in Japan. He is already in the process of getting a new identity and some plastic surgery. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 07:43:00
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:59:58
Mark can still be the owner and hire another CEO. Duh.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:51:51
Two bit idiot is doing the right thing. You all want to be fooled. The bitcoin foundation needs to go as they help the cover up with mtgox. Why does the board member get to withdraw with no problems while everyone else lost millions?
@_date: 2014-03-27 07:52:07
How is the IRS going to track this? They still use Internet Exploder at work and are already behind on paperwork.
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:35:45
I wouldn't work here. They pay shit. The hours are horrible. You get out everyday at 10pm.
