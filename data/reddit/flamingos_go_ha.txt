I've been on SC for over 6 years.  Have about 166k  plays total on my history (I know that's pretty weak but I make very experimental music) haven't earned a dime from my entire history of making music so literally anything would be better,  especially an asset that has the ability to appreciate over time, just saying... 
@_date: 2019-03-14 19:28:08
I signed up as a creator for free... sooooo.

That's awesome man, I make edm/glitchy stuff. Trying to find the bleeding edge of sound design and keep things fresh. You might be the straw that breaks the camels back for me. I'll look into distrokid today while I'm on stream, (I do music production on twitch) this way any followers of mine can see the real time way you sign up to the platform. The idea of paying even more cash is horrific haha but if i can at least break even after a year it would be worth it. Thanks for the comment my dude, I appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-03-13 02:49:17
Just set up my first wallet with blue wallet and linked to account! We are officially up and running.
My music is very experimental, so any highlights/exposure will be amazing. :) I look forward to our partnership and will be promoting your website on twitch whenever I stream. All the best, and if there is any tips or tricks on using your platform please let me know so I can share the knowledge.

I didn't lose anything, gained about 20% since I've only bought for the first time in November after the crash and held until now. I've never sold before and it looks like I panicked. Still logged into app as of right now and am willing to admit when I am wrong. Shit really scared me though. I always had the intent to sell and re invest my gains back in. Looks like I slipped up and that happened sooner than later.  Haha we live and learn. I do want to take this time to research other exchanges though before I buy back in. But yes I do hope feedbands comes through! I am totally shilling that website when I live stream. :)
@_date: 2019-03-16 05:59:14
Wasn't anything huge. Literally no regrets, after all this  shit and just changing my password and then getting signed off again I'm not having it. Im looking to invest in a hardware wallet but just haven't gotten to it yet. Besides I can always re invest at any time. Profits profit. I hear you sounds dumb to dump, but straight up I got scared. Willing to admit it.
@_date: 2019-03-13 01:00:42
I actually just set up a account a few days ago. Was going to set up a link with coinbase but my ID is expired so I cannot set up transfers. I use an android, do you recommend blue wallet? My SC account  is soundcloud.com/flamingosgoha if anyone wants to listen before I upload to feed bands. I have over 150k plays on SC and never saw a dime in return. I am very excited about your service. I also stream music production on twitch,  (twitch.tv/flamingosgoha) was trying to set up crypto donations but streamlabs has removed the option to link to coinbase. Any suggestions? If I like your service I will be recommending to my followers as I believe this is a perfect use case for crypto. :) Thanks for supporting musicians and creators, and i look forward to finishing my account setup. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 13:21:45
Thank you for posting this, it makes sense. The combination of being signed out (first time since account setup, had account about three months and was never signed out before) and not being able to sign back in with my password is what really freaked me out. On reflection I might have actually messed up the initial input of my password when I first signed up and not realized it. Pretty much panicked. Taking this as a learning experience, and understanding the importance of not keeping my crypto on exchange. I was waiting for the release of the ledger nano x but I might just pick up the s model as I'm hearing the x is already on back order.
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:42:55
I actually have looked at distrokid before,  and I do agree with you, the more platforms the better.  Thing is, I'm already paying like $150 a year for my pro soundcloud account (I like to offer free downloads because I know people like to make offline playlists). It just sucks I'm spending time making the music and then have to pay for distribution out of pocket. I've never done pay for plays or any of those scams.  $20 isn't too bad though, I will definitely look into it kind sir. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 06:50:39
Thanks man, starting to feel like shit to be honest. I still believe 100% in crypto and am even trying to teach my friends about it. I've never had any issues like this before and legit got scared that if I had to change my password again or something they wouldn't let me. Just don't want to get locked out for some stupid reason. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 07:07:40
Hey man, for some reason I can't see your comment reply in my thread, but can see it in your comments. Not looking for validation, this is just the only crypto community I'm involved in and was looking for input from more experienced people. Isn't that the point, for you guys to tell me if I fucked up or not? Just looking for a healthy conversation that's all. By your input I've messed up and potentially lost a days profit of growth if everything moons overnight. And I'll take that to heart my man. I appreciate the dialogue. Still learning every day and i still have a lot to learn. All the best and no hard feelings.

Unity and tile maps? I'm currently working on an indie and I'm making all the sprites by hand, games are a lot of work so gg's on the progress
@_date: 2019-03-16 06:26:33
Also instead of insulting me I would politely ask you, what would you do? I've seen twice now people taking profits at around 4k, even if this was just me being a scared lil bitch, how is this any different then regular trading? Don't people eventually cash out and even buy back in at a lower price to increase investment? To be clear I haven't deleted my account. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 16:08:31
I have a question about this, can I just put my wallet address in my description and say donate to said address, and maybe put a duplicate of that address as an on screen overlay? So for example I would have on my screen while I stream maybe on the top right corner "donate bitcoin to - [blue wallet address]" and then in the description the same thing so people can copy and paste address. I tried to get crypto donations through streamlabs but they have removed the option to link to coinbase. So would this be a more direct avenue? I just recently created a blue wallet account to use with feedbands.com and was thinking about this approach with twitch and I'm looking for advice.

Nice..., I've been trying to offer digital artwork for bitcoin, get upvotes but no hits. Lemme know how this works. I'll show my sausage for a satoshi any day. Lolz
@_date: 2019-08-23 06:58:41
I'm sorry to hear that. May I ask why you are adamant on not using kyc? I understand it's annoying but at least you know you aren't getting  scammed. I've heard localbitcoins is a good website that people use that isn't kyc.

My style art I have posted, just looked at my history please. And I ask pay what you want, I will PM btc address and after I receive any amount of payment I will draw/paint digitally any request, that's usually how I do it. I can send you my insta where I post art as well if you wish.
@_date: 2019-08-30 01:48:37
Thanks man, I've never re used an address before,  I always generate a new one as I heard it's better in general for security I guess?? Idk if it's true but Nano makes it so easy to generate a new one so I always do.
@_date: 2019-08-23 05:31:50
Don't say that, we are a crypto community. Small as we are. Gotta look out for each other.
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:30:41
Just checked it out. Looks interesting. A bit advanced for me, even though it looks super streamlined. I guess I need to research lighting a bit more, and I have no expertise in coding lol. But from basic glance I would expect the way to go would be copy the source code from the github link and then apply that to whatever website I choose? Either way, bookmarked the page to come back to after I do a bit more of a deep dive into this. Need to understand what open channel means and nodes, Etc. But this is awesome, thank you for sharing!
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:06:12
Yeah, I don't really have a problem in buying btc, already kyc'd on CB and CashApp, what I mean is, let's say I try to buy and sell on CB, I buy say .01 btc for $100, CB hits me with like $3 dollar fee, I got now $97, I wait and btc going up a couple hundred and now I have say $110, now say this is the best timed stop and reverse play I sell it for the swing trade and I think there is another CB fee for selling plus isn't that then a taxable event? What I'm getting at is a have relatively small positions and I feel like Hodl ing for a few years and gradually accumulating is the way to go personally for me.
@_date: 2019-08-30 01:46:42
Thank you man, I'm trying to setup a new classy donation page akin to Tim Pools on his YouTube channel. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't screwing myself down the line. Btw.. cheers for Native Segwit I love how fast and simple it is. :) Anyway thanks for taking the time to help.

I've developed a technology to turn stress sweat or severe drooling into clean fresh water. So whether we are in a bull market or bear market our lambos stay clean!
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:40:19
Mostly because I slide everything to my Nano S after buying on CB or CashApp, and without leverage trading I feel like I would get hit with fees cause I'm a small fish in a big pond. ;) I've been practicing trading options on Robinhood with small capital but got hit with decay and didn't understand risk management at the time. Long story short I'm not comfortable trying to time the market at this time. Selling at 14k and buying back at 9k for example. I'd rather try and strengthen the community by offering what I can as a use case for spending btc. I even offer pay whatever you want lol just to get things rolling. Got a bite on the Jobs4Link but they never followed through.
@_date: 2019-08-23 04:05:29
I would say, trust your instincts. I recommend cash app or coinbase but they are both kyc. Just be smart friend.
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:17:46

Yes sir, memorizing would definitely be the best and coolest way imo. I think I read "Not your keys, not your bitcoin" about 1000x before it finally clicked. Had a login scare on CB a couple months ago and thought I lost everything. Much love friend, may the crypto be with you.
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:37:23
I watch Jimmy whenever he is on with Tone. I was wondering because I've been coding curious and was recommended learning python, what would you recommend for a step one? I have 0 experience coding so I need to start from the very beginning. I am looking to self teach.

Hey guys I'm trying to stack sats by offering Artwork for Btc on Jobs4bitcoin but its hella slow on that sub. Any recommendations for a freelance artist? Im too afraid to margin trade btc to increase my stack. Just slowly accumulating and DCA.
@_date: 2019-08-30 17:55:48
I downloaded Bluewallet for android a while ago to set up a wallet for a bitcoin music streaming website(feedbands.com). On it there is the option for lightning but I haven't set it up yet. I believe I have to put in like 20k sats for it to work I think. Either way I don't think that would do what you were suggesting. I basically just want to have a clean looking page, I can flash on the screen real quick every now and then when I stream. Just a short "If you want to support, here is how" sort of thing. I stream music production and feedback on twitch, and twitch removed the option to link donations to coinbase which pissed me off. I will definitely look into lightning good sir, I am still quite the newbie in this space but trying to learn more every day. Thanks for taking the time to respond. May the crypto be with you!
@_date: 2019-02-07 23:07:25
So basically your mental perspective is up or down it's always a good time to accumulate?  :)
@_date: 2019-08-30 09:24:26
My bad, wasn't really fishing for upvotes. Trying to build this page and just wanted to make sure I didn't mess up. I understand there is no begging for bitcoin on this sub. Sorry if I misconstrued with my post but an official donation page will help me a lot down the road. May the crypto be with you.

What would you say are practical ways to be a positive influence in this community? 
@_date: 2019-02-03 20:31:19
I am trying to learn more and more everyday about the space. 
"Create and fix documentation,  audit code from existing software and do pull requests for improvements." &lt;--- almost sounds like an alien language to me but I am willing to learn kind sir!
"Try and create popular use cases where people need to buy bitcoins." So basically create a commodity of value and offer it for bitcoin? This is where I think I would like to experiment, as in the coding side I feel like I have mountains to learn. (I've never coded in my life) 
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:02:56

He did on a post on darknet and now removed his account, I have a gut feeling this is all legit, someone messed up a transfer address and now this dude is set for life and so are his kids, and kids kids.
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:07:52
I think it's because most of the scams use bought and paid for high subscriber count accounts that already have a certain clout on the platform. Just a theory. But yes the scam is always the same.

I learned about bitcoin after I was evacuated during the biggest fire to hit California last year. My town was completely devastated and I was forced to live in hotels for 3 month not knowing if my house was standing. During that time I watched a Joe Rogan video interviewing the man who invented the robot Sophia, he kept talking about Ethereum and I slowly fell down the crypto rabbit hole. I slowly started to DCA while Btc was around 3-4k, and I was completely unaware of the amazing community I would join. Now a year later I have a Nano S, funds safely in a wallet not exchange and I'm currently teaching myself C# so I can maybe one day actually understand the code behind this wonderful gift. Not much of a story yet... but we are just starting. :)

Yeah I was one of the lucky ones, and thank you.  There is a little documentary on Netflix about the fire, I think it's called ParadiseFire. And definitely with coding. I do music and art and always wanted to build games but was coding shy. Now I'm starting to understand the fundamentals.

I love the idea, but take any theology ideas/words out, i.e. bible. And would recommend simplifying. Bitcoin is simple. Pier 2 pier currency that operates on a open ledger that runs on proof of work. I don't get why you would need a novel to get someone to understand. Yet they would have the attention span these days to read such. Keep on, love the enthusiasm!
@_date: 2019-09-04 21:45:26
They ****ing wouldn't let me post there. That's where I went first. I am also a bitcoin maximalist btw. My ideas are more fun and playful but each would require a blank slate by design. It's more about using the technology in a different way.
