Signed up, but Kaspersy is blocking the accounts page flagging it as "phishing".

Sounds like he knew about the risks and the need for 2FA but shrugged off as it was only for paranoid fools... Now he want's everyone else to listen to him as THE voice of reason. Everyone else just like him. Buuuhuuu
I've 2FA every account/exchange from the day it becomes available, all my passwords are unique and 20+ random characters long. Still I'm i live in fear, even with my wallets all encrypted on paper in redundant safes in different locations.
It's a war out there, governments are being taken over by hackers (hello Russia 2.0), AI with deep neural nets are deployed looking for zero day vulnerabilities. We are all ducks in a military shooting range with robots on the triggers.
I don't preach or recommend btc to anyone unwilling to learn offline hardware or paper storage with password manager and 2fa. Those are minimum requirements to come and play on this playground.

True and another point we must make sure all newbies are aware. I'm using [Authenticator Plus]( on Android for it has online backup which Google's version lacks.

That's good to know. I used to do my Google Authenticator backups with Titanium Backup, but I think it only works on rooted devices. Still Auth Plus was very well spend $3, with automatic encrypted cloud backups and I like the main pin and folders too.
