I’d love a couple of these! :)

He seemed serious at the start and got more relaxed and then dashboard dog.

Wish these exchanges weren’t advertised to the public so much. Just advertise the coins themselves and more importantly the technology behind them and how average joe can benefit.
A fair few people understand what a bitcoin is. Even less understand how it can benefit them.

I’m just excited about the competition tbh. It’s the moon race all over again. All it takes is a power like Russia to grab a bunch of it then it’s on like donkey kong. Exciting times ahead 
@_date: 2019-01-18 16:58:16
That’s great news for btc adoption tbh
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:30:21
Try local bitcoins. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:18:41
Exciting times yo. I’m trying to buy up as much as I can tbh
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:19:30
This is what I’m not getting... the infrastructure and support for btc is growing but the market isn’t there yet... I’m assuming it’s just because the majority haven’t heard anything in the news or seen anything about btc for a while. For example where I live there were people talking about it for a while but now when I ask someone they just say “oh, you mean that thing that a few people made money off then it died?” It’s just sad because the technology behind it is valuable but the masses don’t understand yet... hopefully they will soon

I got some, not much, just before the moon and made about 2k. Not much but I know people that purchased a few bitcoins at the peak thinking they were going to make millions. I’m buying up as much as I can right now tbh.
I still think there are millions to be made when the masses understand bitcoin instead of just jumping on the bandwagon 
@_date: 2019-01-19 17:28:55
I love this. Me too.
@_date: 2019-01-15 04:38:27
Fingers crossed
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:38:11
You can’t just tell people to be smarter. This is the problem. The first bitcoin moon was created through sheer hype and less understanding of the valuable technology behind it. The next moon which will be much larger, will come when the masses realise the potential in btc.

Oh to be one of those that got on on the ground floor. :(

Only in India...

It would be funny if, due to all of the privacy we are losing, the only btc that will have value is the btc that’s being hedl. Like btc purchased with a photo ID and shit is literally worth nothing. Man, fuck all this privacy invasion, soon I won’t be able to take a shit without someone watching me

I use it about once a month to buy steroids from an online pharmacy. Crypto gets a discount over western union or the other money transfer one so that’s nice. 
The first couple of times I purchased gear online I went through western union. Would always get strange looks from the person behind the counter because it’s hard to hide the fact that you use steroids. You kinda stand out in a crowd. It was odd transferring a similar precise amount of money to a new Turkish name every time. They would do the whole “Do you know this person in real life?” “This is a different name and amount from last time” “Are you aware that people use western union to scam others into sending money?”
Now I have a PO box I got using fake info and I can use btc to buy my juice. Life’s good man.

There are other factors to take on board though, like how society is moving at a faster pace now and people aren’t sure if they can buy a bitcoin.
It could have been the same with gold back in the day. It never took off because gold was being priced by the ounce I guess or a standard nugget size. In the same way a lot of people think you must buy one bitcoin. 
Personally I love this graph, the more I think about correlations between them the more it makes sense.. I’m hopeful

Soon moon, soon.

That’s what really needs to happen it needs to make that transition from “unknown hard to understand internet thing” to just another currency thats easy to obtain and use (I’m hoping it will moon again if this mindset changes). I’m only saying that because I’m hodling obviously but I’m also an advocate for privacy and anonymity I guess.

What is this Simpson’s comment about and why am I laughing my ass of?
@_date: 2019-01-18 17:00:13
Exciting! :)

For people that want to get as much as they can before btc hopefully moons again mining it is going to be too slow 
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:22:21
Fuck that pisses me off, the people want someone to complain to when their transaction is 2 minutes late. I can actually see how decentralisation sounds like the third Reich or something only criminals will benefit from. Why are the masses so dumb?
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:04:16
What does ‘Hold’ mean?
@_date: 2019-01-24 22:47:55
When I’m looking at coins to invest in one deciding factor is how it were to sound if everyone was saying it. So yeah I completely agree. Bitcoin or 30bit just sounds so much better than all the others.
Edit: I’m aware satoshis are divisions of btc. And not another alt coin. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:07:47
All the signs are here for a huge spike. I’m of the belief that 1 btc could actually reach $1 million in the not so distant future. 
Literally thousands of atms are being produced and introduced in populous areas.
Russian government is planning to buy up 470b worth of btc. America could/would/should challenge that?
I think there is going to be a huge shift in world economy at the start of this year. I think it will rock most large banks and tangible assets like gold and silver will skyrocket along with decentralised currencies like btc. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 18:49:33
Ok I got you. I did miss it lol
@_date: 2019-01-24 22:56:08
I like it. I lyk it a-lo.
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:09:58
I’m also a drug addict. So I just get high and wait for btc to moon. Thats most of my days now just sitting around getting cooked and seeing faces in btc charts. Living the dream you could say.
@_date: 2019-01-22 04:54:14
People hodling lots of btc
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:21:22
More and more btc atms gives me hope. Next few pays I’m going all in on btc. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:33:45
For me it’s hard to see more than 4 or 5 coins doing well this early in the game. Btc will always be strong and is due to moon again imho. Trying to buy up more...
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:27:10
Clever :) You could have the scene with professor lupin and the moon in the last panel also. :P
@_date: 2019-01-24 06:15:24
When it said famous people I thought it meant tv celebrities or something. Here I am looking for Tom cruise and what he has to say about bitcoin while he gives me the Scientology stare.
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:14:47
Is it though? Are there not still plenty of people putting life events and all their pictures on there? Everyone I know still uses it.
