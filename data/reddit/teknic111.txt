That’s what I’m asking. Is the private key gonna be the same on a hard fork that doesn’t support Segwit? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:45:25
Any future hard fork of BTC.

And then you’re poor again.
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:42:17
How about just pay your taxes and sleep well at night.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:03:19
If your coins are stored in a Segwit address, will you still be entitled to forked coins?
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:22:15
You must be great at parties.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:49:16
The transaction will not go through. There is a checksum built into wallet addresses that ensures you cannot mistype the address. Your coins should still be on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:33:16
So definitely not tulips.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:40:00
Really??? How do you propose we buy crypto with fiat? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:29:18
Where can you see this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:46
no, the system crashed.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:12:25
How does Feinstein keep getting elected? She's all about raising taxes, banning guns, and now crypto-banning. Is that what the people of California really want??? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:26:48
ALL OR NOTHING
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:08:22
Not true at all. Bitcoin is not a zero-sums game. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:07:53
When bitcoin pops it is going way below 15k and it will be followed by a bear market that could last years. Most people will lose hope and really believe bitcoin is dead.
That’s when I will be buying. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:44:29
This can't be true.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:52:24
You will lose your shirt. Just buy and hold.

Thank god someone actually reads the article.
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:41:30
This has been done since the beginning of fiat currencies. This is nothing new. I am actually surprised that people don't know this. This is why you must invest excess cash!

Thanks! Right back at you... 285 bits @_date: 2014-03-07 01:21:48
Exactly! At the time, Satoshi referred to it as P2P e-cash. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 17:36:03
At this point it isn't really a threat. If it happened, it would easily be identified and miners joining in the attack would just be ignored.

Call me unsympathetic if you want, but the people who left bitcoins sitting in Gox were damn fools! Anyone with even a small understanding of bitcoin knows they shouldn't leave their coins with a 3rd party.  They were ignorant, and ignorant people get burned.
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:23:39
It is still early. You can be an early adopter too!
@_date: 2014-08-16 19:17:58
I fail to see the logic in your response. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:44:42
Can someone explain why Gox has such high prices?  Also is it true that a person who lives in the U.S. isn't even able to withdraw funds from Gox? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:08:51
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:22:16
People who can't spell bitcoin are buying bitcoin.  This is a problem. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:11:06
Because Bitcoin is worth a hell of a lot more.
@_date: 2014-09-10 14:04:47

Not really an option. I have made well over $10,000 profit with bitcoin. If I were to cash out, my bank would automatically inform the IRS.

As long as blockchain technology dominates cryptocurrency, bitcoins will be king. The network is bitcoin's greatest strength and it will remain unmatched for a long long time.
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:17:32
You sir are an idiot! An idiotic fool who hasn't been paying attention to what is going on here.  All these exchanges are a joke and cannot be trusted.  A robust decentralized exchange that can scale with its user base is the answer to this problem.
There are no "normal-ass currency exchanges which happen to sell bitcoin". 
Are you fucking kidding me? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:04:02
The only thing this would do is stifle legitimate business. Using bitcoin for illegal activities wouldn't change at all.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:09:58
None! I wouldn't trust any third-party with my cryptocoins.
I recommend you make a basic paper wallet and keep your coins there. Stay away from the brainwallet.

@_date: 2014-02-21 22:04:52
Do you realize we are in the very early stages of an experimental currency? We are doing something here that has never been done before, especially on a scale this large.  Bad things are expected to happen, and they are necessary to become stronger.  This is not the first catastrophe and it won't be the last!

Capital gains is tax that must be paid on any asset that appreciates in value since the time you bought it.  It doesn't matter if you bought it yesterday or over a year ago. Once you sell that asset for fiat, capital gains must be paid. The only thing that changes after a year is the rate of tax paid.

Every time someone says pump or dump, I want to punch them in the face.
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:16:23
Of course they went above market. Anyone who is serous about buying these coins would have to bid well over market price.
@_date: 2014-07-24 13:38:26
You must be new. Welcome!
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:43:56
I agree.  While many of the alts offer new innovations, they all lack the hashing power of Bitcoin.  The network is Bitcoins greatest asset and I don't see it be overtaken any time soon. Additionally, the implementation of sidechains will render most alts obsolete.
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:26:49
Litecoin is the only true altcoin. All others are scams! Doge was created as a joke coin, for God sake!
@_date: 2014-05-06 02:58:04
This is actually good news! 
@_date: 2014-08-20 01:45:27
That is one expensive potato! 
@_date: 2014-02-18 04:48:04
What happened to Gox is a GOOD thing. It outlines the work we have cut out for ourselves. It was a necessary evil that will propel us forward. Progress will be made that will greatly improve the user experience and robustness of trading tools.  Ultimately, I believe this will accelerate the process of developing a decentralized exchange.  Something this community direly needs. 
It is unfortunate that people lost money, but there is a larger goal here than striking it rich.  For the first time in modern history we have a tool that can truly liberate people from economic tyranny. A tool that empowers the forgotten.  Don't let greed mask what's important.
We have a good thing here, now let's make it better!

Bitcoin can certainly go up, as many will be selling their 2x coins for BTC. The truth is nobody can tell what the price will do, but there are just as many good reasons for the price to go up, as there are reasons for the price to go down. Personally, I’ll be hodling.

While this may be the safest way, it makes more sense to me that forked coins are treated the same as a property split. This would mean that you owe tax on the day you sell and realize a profit.  After all, crypto is considered property by the IRS and is taxes as such.

While you are correct, there is malware out there that detects Bitcoin addresses being copied into memory and changes the value to a malicious address. So when you go to paste it and hit send, your coins are sent to some hacker. 
ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ADDRESSES!!!

Well there are plenty of places that accept it directly, however, i think you’re missing the bigger picture. Once you understand how the fiat system works relative to bitcoin, you will understand what makes bitcoin so superior. The bottom line is that bitcoin does everything fiat does and more, without the need for third parties to make it work. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:29:35

Correct, you can see who is talking to who, but you cannot see what they are saying. That is assuming that the Chinese government has agents on the ground, connected to the network, and are able to sniff all traffic.  Even then you would have to come up with a way to link each node to a person's identity. It is doubtful they would be able to do that by just intercepting the mesh's network traffic. 
As far as intelligence agencies having the ability to crack common encryption that is doubtful also. It is much more probable that they would use an assortment of zero-day attacks to gain root access and intercept the information they need once it is gracefully decrypted.

The best thing to do during a crash is nothing at all. Every bitcoin crash has recovered and gone on to hit new highs. 
You however have truly lost; your coins are likely gone for good. The real tragedy is that this could have been avoided, if only you did a little research. 
Take it as a good life lesson.

There is nothing wrong with Bitcoin. The only people who get screwed like this are the uneducated and lazy. If you had taken the time to research your investment, you would have learned the basic rules for securing your coins. The two golden rules of crypto are...
     Never invest more than you are willing to lose.
     Never leave your coins on an exchange. 
I have Bitcoins from 2013 and I can rest peacefully at night, knowing that my coins are safe in cold-storage.

@_date: 2015-02-15 09:06:05
Fuck GoDaddy!
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:12:05
It's been there for many months now.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:12:37
Why dump your coins, when you are about to get free ones? It would seem logical that the dump would happen after the fork.

Hopefully he will serve out his sentence in a minimum security facility.
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:50:53
Does it not apply to other currencies as well?
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:44:22
Yeah, that would be a fair trail. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 22:18:22
What's with people making postings and asking not to up vote? 
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:40:29
I blame op. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:27:42
I can't wait until this becomes a viable alternative to eBay.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:53:26
You had your entire life savings tied up on an unregulated anonymous bitcoin exchange? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:19:16
It is crazy that the FBI can arrest someone who is not American and did not commit any crimes on American soil.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:51:36
I'm sure he understands what a fork is. While BCC is a fork, it is not the fork everyone feared several weeks ago. The fork is such a small part of the network, that it is now a non-issue for BTC hodlers.

"all the large investors"
I'm not saying you are not right, but I wouldn't count on it. People have been saying, "large investors are about to move in" for a very long time.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:40:02
It's been there for quite a few months now. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:10:36
Videos like this are not helping our cause.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:48:25
If you want it to be like stocks, why don't you just invest in stocks? I personally like bitcoins volatility. It literally gets me high!
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:51:15
But everyone was in at the last ATH. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:41:42
The great purge is among us! 
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:24:24
OP, you're an asshole and your girlfriends family is full of assholes too.  
Offended by someone giving you bitcoins for Christmas?  Give me a break! 
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:32:51
Why not both?
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:00:52
I'm willing to bet it's the same noobs who bought high and sold low. They're just sour, because they lost money in something that has returned nearly 700% YTD, even after the so called "crash".

I am more interested in the biological computer made with human DNA!

Your local Noble Lord, like a Duke.
@_date: 2015-02-15 07:57:42
Well, it obviously doesn't work.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:21:32
You're freaking out, that's what's happening.

A true quantum computer would be the endgame for mining.  It could theoretically mine every remaining coin at once.

I cannot wait for the day that bitcoin destroys PayPal! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:07:04
The man speaks the truth. Anyone who truly understands the protocol and has basic knowledge of how global finance works can see this crystal clear! 
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:24:45
It's common knowledge that the majority of financial institutions readjust their positions quarterly or at the start of a new year.  Given the attention that bitcoin has received in the past quarter, it's a good bet that many brokers will be offering bitcoin investments to their clients.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:24:11
Less supply can only mean more demand. Coinbase's halt can only serve to increase the price of bitcoin further. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:55:39
Bitcoin doesn't care about the price of bitcoin! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:14:14
It really depends on the degree of the problem.  Yes, the code can be patched, but let's say that we found a bug that allowed an exploiter to forge blocks that were accepted by the network. A problem of that degree would shatter confidence in the network and kill the value of bitcoin overnight. In this type of scenario, you wouldn't have time to sell and move to another currency, without suffering major or almost total losses.
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:40:29
but you're assuming we'd be able to tell which blocks are forged.  In all likelihood, if a bug of this magnitude was ever found, you would't be able to tell the good blocks from the bad blocks, thus destroying network confidence.  
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:47:11
Nice! Good luck to you guys!!
@_date: 2013-09-08 03:39:17
Actually, I believe it's a string of 8 digits.
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:12:58
This is a great idea, but the prices need to be dynamic.  The price of each item should adjust to the USD value in real time.  The price of bitcoin is way to volatile to just set and forget product prices.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:10:17
That may be the first thing they've done right!
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:13:22
No, your relatives are douches if they don't appreciate it.  
@_date: 2013-08-03 20:37:32
How do you make a site like this? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:45:40
This is simply not true!

2014 will be the year of Satoshi.
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:37:15
Holy shit!
@_date: 2013-01-30 18:58:08
If bitcon became a major threat to central banks, couldn't they just derail the currency by launching a 51% attack?  They certainly have the means to do so! 
@_date: 2013-09-07 21:09:32
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:14:16
Of course, just not through a broker. 
@_date: 2013-09-07 21:05:00
Thanks, but what's the best way to go about doing this?
