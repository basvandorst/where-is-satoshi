I'm still working on what kind of limits will be in place. For now a rough guess would be 4 per BTC Address per hour. No more then 30% of any days Total BitHits per 1 IP Address.
Basically meaning you are allowed to submit multiple BTC Addresses from 1 IP Address, but no more then 30% of the total.
Now if your submitting the same BTC Address from multiple IP's well.. Thats a different story. Still loose limit of 4 per hour for now.
Site is still in development, but payments are processed at least once a week. More traffic means quicker payouts. More then likely daily payouts soon.
