About a month or two ago, on this very sub, I asked a simple question; What makes it valuable?
It was painful. It took about 2 days to get an educated response. Most arguments boil down to “it’s uncontrollable internet money.” But that’s not a satisfactory response for most people. 
The problem is lack of information but it’s perpetuated by people that only understand the surface of it.

This is actually, basically, what I’m looking to disprove in this thread. As far as I can tell, bitcoin is essentially the same as a stock. And US stocks are backed by the US dollar.
@_date: 2019-09-29 06:43:42
Are you serious? How do you do that?
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:48:14
Not all stocks pay dividend. Dividend isn’t a factor of value imo.

Anyway, I’m not saying surveillance is the answer, but some sort of oversight is needed so we can be sure the money isn’t being distributed to crime syndicates or billionaires instead of the general public. Imagine trump paid Putin millions of dollars with bitcoin. We would want to know that. Bitcoin stopping our (the people) knowledge of such a transaction is bad, not good.

How do you figure I don’t believe in freedom? Because I don’t understand bitcoin? That’s a bit of a stretch and an unfair label...
If you’re going to transfer money to North Korea, or any dictator run abusive state, it should be tracked. Because the only people who really want to give North Korea money are the super rich anyway. They want tension so they can make money on defense industry stocks.
That’s not going against freedom, it’s going against total monetary anarchy.

Probably the best explanation in this swamp of a thread, thank you. Couple questions;
I know most fiat is losing purchase power but the US dollar is holding strong. I’m under the impression that, as the world reserve currency, the US dollar is different.
Is there a reason the dollar can’t gain network effect? The majority of it exists digitally anyway, right? 
Scarcity is good for value but it’s not good as a currency. Is this the case with bitcoin? For a large and growing economy there needs to be a distribution of wealth. (Made up stats incoming) If Billionaires hoard 40% of bitcoins today and accumulate up to 90% over the next decade, wouldn’t literally everything get worse? Homelessness, poverty, cooperate control and influence over government, etc? And what’s to stop them from doing that?

Why? What’s the point of Reddit or this forum if I HAVE to do my own research? Isn’t the whole thing kind of pointless? Why can’t there be discussion and learning on more than one platform? Why is google the end all be all? Why is YouTube the place to learn everything? Why feed into the major corporate forms of media consumption? You’re a fucking joke of a redditor for even suggesting I go elsewhere for information. And you’re a joke of a bitcoiner for suggestions I rely on large corporate entities for information.

It absolutely has value. I prefer to learn via discussion (engaged learning) rather than research (passive learning). There are 7 different methods of learning, btw;
Visual (spatial):You prefer using pictures, images, and spatial understanding.
Aural (auditory-musical): You prefer using sound and music.
Verbal (linguistic): You prefer using words, both in speech and writing.
Physical (kinesthetic): You prefer using your body, hands and sense of touch.
Logical (mathematical): You prefer using logic, reasoning and systems.
Social (interpersonal): You prefer to learn in groups or with other people.
Solitary (intrapersonal): You prefer to work alone and use self-study
Clearly I prefer social and logical learning, but it seems most people here want to try to force me to be solitary and it’s just not my style. I presented my theory and I engaged in the following discussion. 
The way I see it, anyone who insists you “google it” is a fraud; as in, they have no idea what they’re talking about and they want you to figure it out for them. They only know what someone has told them, true or not,  and therefore have no real understanding of what they’re talking about. They’re trying to shut you down because they can’t step up and explain... because they don’t actually get it.

Im not about to go to college for finance or economics just to understand why bitcoin exists. Although this is one of my huge problems with backing bitcoin; Why can no one explain this in laymen’s terms? This is exactly my point when I say I understand people think bitcoin has value, but no one seems to know why. 
I feel I have an average understanding of the history of money. It started with things that actually had value... resources such as food and/or shelter materials. Then changed as civilization grew... gold, silver, copper, diamond etc. Eventually you get  money as we know it. Money that “represents” value rather than “is” value. 
How is bitcoin “actually” valuable rather than “representative” of value?

Bitcoin is needed to write to the blockchain i.e make a transaction. That’s a thing of value that bitcoin does that I didn’t before know it did, and no one would explain that to me. Even if you don’t care I’m glad you replied because this clears up a lot for me. Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:26:13
I didn’t mean directly or technically. I’m not saying the “textbook” tells you it represents property, but it absolutely does. It’s only use is to buy things. You can trade it for a service with someone else who also wants to buy things. But in the end it’s for buying things. Things are property. So how does it not represent property? 
Why aren’t you explaining anything? You’re just shooting me down without even a link for me to educate myself. It’s crazy how everyone here seems to think I’m attacking bitcoin. 
I’m getting downvoted for saying “it seems like a stock to me”. What the f? Why? Because it’s not a direct correlation? That’s the point of the words “seems” as in, appears to be, and “like” as in, similar. I’m just explaining my current understanding and I want to understand better. 
Now you’re saying it’s not a currency. Okay, then wtf is it? An asset class? How is it an asset if it doesn’t do anything? At least with gold you can hold it physically.. weigh it. Etc. 
Why would anyone want bitcoin other then its value relative to fiat currency?
The only thing this sub has accomplished is making me adjust my question a million times. Like you all can’t just infer what I’m asking.
I thought this was a place for discussion and education by pro bitcoiners. Instead I’m getting attacked by sewer rats. It feels like I’m at r/wallstreetbets right now.
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:14:46
If you’re trolling: haha, very funny.
If not; aren’t you technically supposed to pay taxes on bitcoin gains?
@_date: 2019-09-29 09:42:38
No. I don’t understand why you’re having such a hard time with this. Are you completely stupid?
@_date: 2019-09-28 05:33:22
I don’t. You’re right. Exactly why I’m here. Why should I trust google? A company propped by the US dollar? How can I trust them for accurate information? 
I have an idea. How about you explain it to me? Why will the dollar be worthless? What do you know?

I love the positivity! How did you become so positive on bitcoin? Is there a good book about it I can read?
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:43:48
Awesome stuff here thank you. Super informative. I want to clarify my second question though,
It’s not so much about living in the street hoarding crypto. It’s more like.. hypothetically... 6 billion people in the world &amp; the top 1% own 40% of bitcoin. Say in 100 years the population grows to 12 billion but the top 1% have accumulated 90% of bitcoin (is the case with fiat today, no?). There’s more people but less bitcoin to go around. “Printing money” sounds bad, but it helps the dollar reach more people despite the rich hoarding most of it. How will bitcoin defend against this if inflation isn’t an option?
I suppose the government could enforce a ridiculous tax and then redistribute the wealth via basic income..
@_date: 2019-09-29 06:39:26
Bitcoin is essentially the same as a stock in the sense that it’s traded like a stock. It’s not traded like a currency. I didn’t mean to communicate that I thought bitcoin was exactly the same as a stock. I understand there’s no profits. Captain obvious is obvious, obviously. 
Also, stocks are not “backed” by business activity. The property they own, the profit they produce, the dividends they give out... it’s all against the usd. you HAVE to accept the usd as payment in the us. That’s backed by the government. The government is backed by the police and the military. No one HAS to accept
Bitcoin. Bitcoin isn’t backed by powerful forces.
@_date: 2019-09-28 05:25:39
Exactly my question. Bitcoin SEEMS to be backed by the dollar. If it weren’t, why would anyone trade it? Why would Venezuelan citizens deposit their savings into bitcoin? Because bitcoin holds its value. How does it hold its value? Against the US dollar. The Venezuelan dollar drops against the usd while bitcoin remains steady. This much makes sense to me. 
While more places are accepting bitcoin, it’s not exactly widespread. Depending who you ask, the future of bitcoin looks promising, but they never elaborate. I simple want to know; why?  When you have it, what’s it good for? What does it do? The USD on the other hand, it’s backed by the US government, and therefore the US military. The US dollar is backed by immense political power.
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:35:44
Isn’t that bad though? What happens when someone accumulates 50% of bitcoin? You can’t just print more for the people who don’t have any. I thought that was the point of fiat vs trading with gold/silver coins. 
What’s stopping a government, say North Korea, from hoarding tons of bitcoin and then distributing fiat that’s “backed” by bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:17:25
I’ll half concede.. I haven’t really considered those living in less fortunate countries but monetary anarchy doesn’t jive with me.
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:26:05
But this is where bitcoin falls flat for me. If it doesn’t do anything, it doesn’t have actual value. The only reason you might accept bitcoin in exchange for a service is because you believe the risk is worth the potential reward. This is exactly how stocks are traded. Buy low (or trade a good or service for it) and sell high (for thousands of USD, which you can then use to buy whatever the **** you want). 
At least gold is a conductor.
@_date: 2019-09-28 07:33:46
So what you’re saying is the value of bitcoin is based on what the people say bitcoin is worth? This is basically my understanding coming into the posting of this thread and I was really hoping it would be wrong, 
The reason being that you can’t expect something that is worthless to be worth something suddenly just because someone says it is. Gold will always have value. So will iron and silver and steel: real world materials with real world applications are going nowhere. 
I want to know how bitcoin fits in here. I’m a millennial and I don’t use bitcoin for anything. I’m not worried about my paycheck at all. 
I firmly believe the US dollar is backed by military might, and I don’t think it’s a bad thing for bitcoin to be backed by the US dollar.
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:19:53
I agree it probably is a better hold than spy. Historically better gains, depending when you bought in, of course. 
Isn’t inflation actually good? And the printing of currency? These two things alleviate the burden of hoarding value by the rich, no? Isn’t this the reason the gold standard was abandoned?
@_date: 2018-07-12 06:50:05
Is there any way to convert that or use it to estimate what that means in terms of Hz? I’m wanting to compare it to a super computer
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:50:12
I want to add that most fiat currency is actually digital. If everyone tried to withdraw all their money at the same time there wouldn’t be enough for everyone. 
On top of that, I can transfer my money anywhere in the world. Maybe not instantly, but that’s not a limitation of the system as much as it is regulations. (And in many cases it is instant, like apple paying my rent goes through instantly)
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:42:10
This is a good point.
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:30:23
That’s actually a really fantastic point to be made. Until a government accepts bitcoin as a currency, the local currency will only ever be good enough for bail. Therefore local currency is equal to the value of freedom. 
That’s kind of tough to beat.
Disclaimer; I’m not rooting against bitcoin. I’m actually for it. But I have a lot of questions.
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:22:26
No inflation actually benefits the rich. Those with lots of money lose no value. Hyperinflation is obviously bad for everyone because money ends up being cheaper than toilet paper. 
Normal, steady inflation can be good. I think is best for the middle classes. It increases the value of certain assets, so if you’re a home/land owner it’s good. That’s a win. It decreases the value of the dollar, so it’s bad for anyone hoarding cash. That’s a win. Stocks will adjust, so if you’re sitting on investments/retirement funds you’ll be fine, so that’s also a win.
@_date: 2019-09-29 06:41:32
You say that like it’s a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:39:58
Because it’s likely the value of your native currency is linked to another currency you don’t hold or particularly care about. This is why I’m so focused on the correlation between bitcoin and the US dollar rather than other fiat currencies.
