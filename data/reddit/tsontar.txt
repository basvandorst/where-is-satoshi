Yes, Satoshi didn't see the future of mining very clearly.
But shouldn't we agree that if it were possible to get appreciably closer to the vision of "approximately-equal miners", that would increase the decentralization and health of the whole ecosystem?
This is the point of hewing to the vision of the white paper: it establishes a goal-state that we should be working toward.

So tell me, from whom does one seek permission to make a change?
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:53:59
That's an oversimplification.
First off, not all PoWs scale equally easy.  PoWs that are hard to scale should be expected to centralize more slowly.
Secondly, PoW change sends a lasting shock through the centralized mining community and their custom-hardware manufacturing partners.  By making these deep investments in hardware suddenly worthless by changing PoW, *future* high-capitalization players become *much* more wary about making huge investments in hardware.  The result is that the biggest mining participants either exit mining altogether, or must resign themselves to much smaller investments in hardware combined with hedges in case of another PoW change.

No, not at all.
The market value appreciation must be understood in context.
You have to start by assuming some motivation for the split.  Forks don't just rise up out of thin air, they arise because of fundamental differences in the community.
Forcing everyone into one tent - when some significant number of holders *do not want to live under that tent* means that value will suffer, because these people have no choice but to dump their coins in favor of another currency altogether.  That harms price.
Allowing these people instead to fork the currency to suit their values creates the opportunity for them to double down.  This is exactly what we're seeing now in "that other crypto."
Forking for no motivation obviously will provide no benefit.  The key here is that 
1. There is a preexisting division in the community that hurts coin price, and
2. After the split, everyone gets the coin whose fundamentals they prefer
That's an "economically efficient" (ie win-win) outcome.  Economic theory teaches that the market will value this more than a win-lose (some people get the coin whose fundamentals they prefer, and the rest can pound sand).

This is one of my primary beefs with lightning as a "scaling solution" as all endpoints must be online with all available funds in hot wallets.
Yes, you have to compromise two endpoints in order to steal (unless the thief is one of the endpoints) but as you point out, it's only a matter of the attackers skill, and presumably at least one endpoint is an average user. You just can't get the level of offline security that's needed to protect larger sums, and if LN is intended to solve scaling, it will have to protect larger sums.

I agree the terms can be confusing.
However you make an interesting point that gets to the heart of why I made this post.  As you correctly state, Satoshi envisioned "widespread CPU mining by individuals" - that was the sort of decentralization that was supposed to keep everyone "honest-mining."  It's true that we have yet to truly solve this problem, although other coin projects have made valuable developments along these lines (ie by using ASIC-resistant algos that keep mining feasible on consumer hardware).  The point is: if we don't agree that it's a problem to be solved, then it won't get solved.
And thus - it's really important that people understand this original vision for the network.  Everyone interested should understand what Satoshi was trying to achieve, and why aspects like "widespread mining" are integral parts of making the system work correctly.  It's a problem for me when people argue "the white paper is just a historical document with no relevance anymore because Satoshi was wrong about some things" because with a single hand-wave these people throw the baby out with the bathwater.

ETH is the perfect example of my point!
Since it's permissionless, nobody could prevent the ETC fork.
However, this also means that nobody could prevent the rollback of the DAO, hence not immutable.

In what way is ETC "immutable?" ETC is essentially exactly the same code as ETH and it can fork / rollback just as ETH did.

That's an interesting assessment. It seems you believe that the only value that drives investors to Bitcoin is scarcity. What about usability and other features?
Bitcoin is "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" according to its author. Presumably many people bought and hold Bitcoin because they believe it to have properties of digital cash, not an investment metal.


This is true. But it seems to disregard the fact that division in the community and constant infighting also has a strong negative effect on price, and assumes that investors won't be drawn to one or the other fork based on fundamentals other than scarcity.


I can't see how your conclusion follows from your premise. The same investor should also have the same concerns about alts, as he cannot know that some alt will not supersede Bitcoin, and should invest in a portfolio of cryptos.

I brought Bitcoin into this because both Bitcoin and Ethereum forked / rolled back what were otherwise perfectly valid transactions for the same reason: a perceived existential threat to the community.
Other Ethereum contracts have borked, but they weren't rolled back. Why not? No perceived threat. Likewise I believe that if the Bitcoin attacker had taken a white-hat approach (mined a few extra Bitcoin for the yuks) then we wouldn't have gone through the trouble and risk to roll those transactions back, even though 21M+a few extra coins isn't the social contract. It was a question of threat.

If some percentage of users sell and buy an altcoin, has the cap been broken?
A persistent fork is simply the creation of a new altcoin with an existing distribution of users.  The existing coin (presuming it persists) maintains all the properties of the original.

Hi Brian, I just wanted to comment on something you wrote in your article.  You wrote:






This is a good point which deserves more explanation:
Economics theory teaches that the total market cap of the two coins *should* exceed that of the one coin, all other things equal.
Suppose hypothetically that a blockchain were to split 60/40 over a contentious issue.
Realize first: this can only happen if the USERS are split 60/40 on a truly important issue.  A 60/40 or 70/30 etc fork could never occur unless users were *strongly* divided and the issue was fundamental.
And if the users are *strongly* split 60/40 but the coin isn't split, then users can only make the choice to HOLD/EXIT.  What happens to market value if 40%-60% are holding a coin whose fundamentals they disagree with?  We must presume that many users will exit and coin price will suffer.  And as we know, if coin price suffers enough, it harms mining and damages network effects.
Conversely, if users are split 60/40 and the coin splits, so that *everyone gets the coin whose fundamentals they prefer* then what happens to net market value of the combined chains?  We know from economics that such win-win solutions will drive the price of the combined market cap above the market cap of the original coin.
This is what we're seeing with the Ethereum fork.  Each set of stakeholders is bidding up the value of the coins whose fundamentals they agree with, since each "side" has an economic outlet with which to express their preferences.  ETH is still trading in its pre-split range, and ETC continues to grow in market cap, because both groups have something they can bet on.
@_date: 2016-04-21 14:01:46
In my opinion the issue with mining centralization relates to the ratio of fixed vs variable costs.
The first issue is efficiency and geographic centralization.  If the variable costs (electricity) are high compared to the capital outlay requirement (mining HW), then this makes the relative cost of hoarding miners low, and motivates the miner to hoard mining equipment near to cheap electricity.
If the variable costs are low compared to the capital outlay requirement, then there is much less relative advantage to mining near to cheap electricity.
So efficiency is extremely important to geographic decentralization.  The more efficient a miner, the less relatively advantageous it is to mine where power is cheapest.  In the absurd example, a miner that uses no electricity is equally efficient everywhere.
The next issue is scale and monopolization.  For so long as a next-gen processor will promise a 10X scaling factor, miners will compete to produce this processor at virtually any cost.  This means that to date, we have seen mining hardware dominated by customers with very deep pockets willing to produce expensive new-gen hardware in small batch sizes.  When next-gen processors produce only, say, 15% improvements in performance, then it will not be possible to finance the R&amp;D with only a few very deep pockets.  One can imagine a big mining operation deciding *not* to upgrade to new miners because the expense wouldn't justify the improvement in hashrate.
Instead, hardware vendors will have to expand their base by producing less expensive, more efficient processors in higher volume.
We can see that heretofore, only those few people with the deepest pockets have access to leading-edge mining hardware which is necessary for the security (and control) of the blockchain.  When next-gen hardware becomes only marginally more powerful, but cheaper, more power efficient, and more plentiful, it will be less easy to monopolize by a few power players.

I used to agree with this point of view.  I no longer do.
In a spinoff fork like this, any coins that exist before the fork exist on both chains.  So the following dynamic is created:
1. If you believe strongly in the merits of one fork over the other, then you sell your coins on the other fork, pushing its price down (you probably reinvest this in more coins on the fork you prefer, pushing its price up).
2. If you don't have strong feelings, you can simply sit it out / defer your decision.  Your coins have value on both chains in the meantime.
So people can dump one side of the fork or the other, and hurt the price of one side of the fork or the other, roughly in proportion to their opinion on the issues and their economic power.  Which is about as egalitarian as you can get in Bitcoin.
Meanwhile, both systems will keep humming merrily along.  If one actually does demonstrate added value vs the other, then the market has the opportunity to price that in.
Since this type of fork is totally non-coercive, everyone is free to simply judge for themselves, and make their own choices.  If you like things the way they are, you can sell your coins on the new fork, and take whatever profit you make and buy more coins on the old fork.  If you like what the new fork represents, you can sell coins on the old fork and buy new-fork coins.  If you just want to see how this all plays out, you can just hold.  If you need to transact, you can do so on either chain as you see fit.
It's helpful to game this out:
Perhaps practically nobody wants the NewBitcoin.  The entire market can simply ignore its existence.  Nobody has to upgrade anything, or protect against anything - it's like it never happened.
Perhaps the new fork is instantly dumped and the price plummets to only 5% of current price.  That would still make NewBitcoin a Top 10 alt.  It can hang out there, and if it provides actual utility, it has the opportunity to grow.
Perhaps ~50% of people want NewBitcoin.  Great - the market can value both coins roughly equally.  Each coin will offer something slightly different to its constituency, and thus specialize better in those things the market wants.  The total net value of both coins' market cap should exceed the current cap.  Anyone who holds coins on both chains will be richly rewarded.
It's this last case - where the market is actually undecided - that such a fork would be *most* helpful.  When such a divided community is forced to remain in one camp, it can only cause infighting and hostility, as one or the other side believes its most important needs are going unmet, or being outright attacked.  Markets hate this stuff.  Instead, by allowing the community to split, certainty is brought to the market: each faction can see its preferences expressed.  The market is free to simply place educated bets.
This is what happens when you introduce non-coercive change into a permissionless system: these controversial decisions simply become a function of utility and market pricing.

A soft-fork may or may not have the consensus of the community when it is implemented.  If a soft-fork is implemented which the community does not agree with, their only option is to sell their coins.  This is fragile for the ecosystem and coin price.
A hard-fork cannot be implemented without the express consensus of the community.  It carries with it no risk of rejection by the ecosystem and no risk of hurting the price due to non-acceptance.
I guess it's up to the reader to decide for himself what is and is not "reasonable."

Crafty developers think that changing the name of a variable changes something important.  Smart developers know that variables can be named "MAX_BLOCK_SIZE" or "MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE" or "GREG_MAXWELL" because the *symbol is not the thing.*
In reality, you guys are changing the block size limit without explicit consensus, which as Core devs have repeatedly pointed out, is a "coup" equivalent to "stealing people's Bitcoin."

So in order to protect freedom, we must eliminate choice.  Got it.
I just don't understand the rhetoric.
How does providing alternatives equate to an "attack on consensus?"

@_date: 2016-04-20 18:39:39
No, in a soft fork, if I "do nothing", I'm still connected to the network, and I still relay blocks as valid.  It really has no impact on the miners' decision to release the change.
One would have to write software that detects soft-forked blocks and rejects them, refusing to follow their chain, to achieve a similar result.  But it's still not the same thing as a HF.  In a HF the onus is on the miners to bring the network along.  In a SF the onus is on the network to counterattack.
@_date: 2016-04-20 09:51:52
Maybe so, it was a bad idea in the first place to seek permission to change a permissionless currency.
The right strategy *should* have been to simply code a fork at a specific block height (as Satoshi proposed), fork the coin (with or without a change in POW), and let people decide which fork they want to run / trade on.
That's how you do permissionless.  Not by asking permission, but by just doing it.

If 75% of miners didn't care about the price of the coin, they'd just change the code tomorrow and start paying themselves double. 
They don't do this, because they realize it's economic suicide. Everyone would move their coins immediately to the 25% fork,  and the miners who made the change would be bust.

Long term I think Bitcoin is antifragile and such stresses only harden it. Short term I get frustrated.

@_date: 2015-06-23 02:44:59
No. This is not the case. If even 99% of miners want to run code that the economic majority does not agree with, then the majority will choose to transact on the chain mined by the 1% who run their preferred code. The 99% would be mining a worthless coin while the 1% earn all the money. 
Miners must always follow the will of the economic majority.

That's right. We can trust honest miners to act as a proxy for the rest of the ecosystem, because honest miners want most of all for coin prices to go up. So if 75% of miners agree to make a change, we can trust that it's probably because most everyone else wants the change as well. 


Then they won't run it. Your can stop worrying. 


You are now discussing a hostile attack on the network, not the behavior of honest miners. If 75% of miners want to attack, we're facing a very different situation from the one you and I have been discussing.

@_date: 2015-12-01 12:51:58
Thanks for the helpful answer. Makes a lot of sense. Raises other questions though. First things first.
Let me see if I understand the logical conclusion. 
The Internet is not homogeneous. This means that there will always be a bottleneck somewhere. And that means that on one side of the bottleneck, there will be more miners than on the other side. And the side with more miners than the other automatically has an advantage vis a vis the other side, creating a natural monopoly condition on that side of the bottleneck.
Is this true in your opinion? 
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:29:53
Yes, the votes / vetoes are votes / vetoes on block validity, not the software used to create the block.  We can run different rules, so long as they happen to coincide, we have consensus. 
If Core switched to 2MB blocks tomorrow, but 90% of the rest of the network switched to XT, and blocks became ~1.5MB, we would still have consensus. If blocks became 1.9 MB we would still have consensus. If Core then changed to 3 MB and blocks became 2.5 MB we would still have consensus. Etc.
You run the software that expresses the ruleset that you believe constitutes valid blocks. That (and buying / selling) are the only votes that matter.

You do understand that even if BIP 101 activates, the "three people who control all mining" according to Greg are in no way forced to make blocks larger than 1 MB?
Saying that BIP 101 will destroy Bitcoin is hyperbole and hurts what has mostly been a polite discussion with goods points made. If it turns out to be harmful, lowering the limit only requires a soft fork which could be quickly deployed.

There are tens of millions of people in Europe who hate the euro and the control that the central bank in Brussels has over their little corner of Europe...
What you call these people is irrelevant.  What matters is that there are very many people who share the same basic worldview about central banking and / or monetary policy.  1% seems quite conservative to me.
1% of 7B people is 70M.
I'd put the current number of Bitcoin holders at 1% of that, around 700,000.  Estimates vary but it's probably a reasonable enough estimate.
So if 70M would value Bitcoin *purely on political motive* and only  700K currently hold, that means only 1% of potential *politically motivated* bitcoin holders are in yet.

Let's say that there was roughly 25% consensus for large blocks today and so a bunch of people decided to hard fork anyway, and together with some miners and a couple of exchanges created Bigcoin. Of course the coin isn't secure (75% of the network could attack and double-spend) and there's hardly any market for it. 
With that level of support, how much do you think I could get for a Bigcoin?
That's an idea of what coins on the minority chain will be worth after a 75% hard fork to larger blocks. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 04:43:24


The economic majority benefits from larger blocks but not a change to the inflation schedule. So you can quit worrying that one will lead to tie other. 


Yep, and if said majority wants larger blocks, all they have to do is mine them and relay them. No permission needed.
They idea that's some small group of a half dozen devs can stop Bitcoin's permissionless innovation reflects a profound misunderstanding of Bitcoin.

Emphasis mine. 
This requires you to be a miner capable of reliably solving blocks as well as having a vested interest in harming Bitcoin.
The economic disincentive is extremely strong.  You could be double spending instead, or you could just solve blocks reliably and hold transactions back, forcing monopolistic transaction fees.

That's the only consensus that counts. Anything else is window dressing. 
As the author of the change I don't have a vote or a veto, I just propose the idea, and the network votes by running the code.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:59:11
Why? Full nodes can and will independently and voluntarily choose to set their own limits (refuse to accept blocks larger than X) based on the network conditions they face at the time.
An attacker trying such an attack is risking throwing away their block reward if they attempt an attack but the network refuses their block. Should an attack commence such an attack it will be very visible and the network can respond flexibly. 
This is sort of analogous to saying your PHP processor needs to have a hard-coded MAX-UPLOAD-SIZE instead of letting webmasters set it based on their application needs and the degree to which they feel their site presents an overflow attack threat.

You are mistaken.  The coin is controlled ultimately by the "economic majority."
If 99% of miners wanted to produce unlimited coins, then they're welcome to write and run that code starting today, but no nodes will accept their blocks, because people holding and using coins do not want their coins devalued, and thus will not run code that accepts blocks from the 99%.  Instead, the 1% of miners who do not go along with the other 99% will produce all the blocks on the "true" blockchain, and thus collect 100% of the fees and block rewards.
As you can see, it's what the "economic majority" wants that matters.  Miners ultimately must mine on the most desirable chain.

1 one minute confirmation is not as secure as 1 ten minute confirmation. 
However.

And it's much faster to get to one or two confirmations.

You can get validation on bitcoin transactions immediately as well.  That is exactly the point.  You do not have to wait for confirmations.  Confirmations = "money cleared and spendable".
Wallets and POS services can monitor the network for near-real-time transaction validation.  This is the equivalent to the "light duty" transaction validation performed by credit cards.

You say that as if self-driving cars and all the other unrelated tech Google invests in are all just onramps to search and ads.
Google regularly invests billions of dollars in unrelated technology. "It isn't part of our core business" is just middle manager code for "not interested" / "not my job."
I'm sure if someone presented Larry Page a realistic path towards controlling the world's flow of money over the Internet using bitcoin he would pivot Google into a Bitcoin business by Tuesday.
The problem with bitcoin at companies like Google is: bitcoin doesn't produce tactical problems / opportunities, it produces *strategic* problems / opportunities. Strategic decisions are made at the very top of the organization and there is very limited bandwidth for executives to assess everything that presents a strategic challenge. So the decision gets deferred until it's too late.
Maybe this was what you were trying to say but it really isn't about "fit with core business." That's a red herring.

A decentralized ledger is a disruptive technology.  Existing businesses will be slow to adopt it because it doesn't fit existing business models.
In the same way that there was no obvious or simple way for Blockbuster to leverage the Internet to stay on top - the technology didn't "enable better DVD rental shops" it made them obsolete.
Likewise there are classes of centralized functions that are now obsolete thanks to the blockchain.  To see what's going to happen in this space, you have to pay attention to startups, how they are using the blockchain to solve problems differently than they've ever been solved before, and then imagine some of these startups actually getting a hit and "obsoleteing" an entire industry.
If you were watching top companies in 1995 you'd likely conclude that the Internet would be of little importance, since most of the best known companies weren't really doing anything interesting with it.  Google, Ebay, Amazon etc. were like by-products of the Internet.
We have yet to see what the by-products of Bitcoin will be, as it's only really been "investment-worthy / legal" since 2014 and so last year and this year is when the startups really began moving in.

Banks can do this and probably will. But such a blockchain does not confer the same benefits whatsoever as a global decentralized blockchain.
For example, consider that each business runs its own private computer network. That network (intranet) may be very useful, even essential to business functions, but it is in no way a substitute for the global decentralized network, the Internet.
In the early days of computer networking most companies spent most of their IT resources on "internal networking" applications, as applications for using the Internet for business were still not clear. 
Many larger companies for example started off with internal email systems that were not at first even connected to the Internet. While such systems obviously were valuable for interoffice communication, in hindsight it should be clear that it was the external, decentralized application of email that offered the most transformative power. 
Likewise blockchains.

It was a knee jerk anti spam measure that no longer serves any purpose.
It arose at a time when it was very inexpensive to competitively mine bitcoin. Hostile miners (people not mining for profit but purely to spite Bitcoin) could easily mine blocks and stuff them full of garbage transactions.
Today it is very costly to reliably mine blocks so the incentive to spend a few million bucks just to spam the network is very low.
Furthermore since most blocks are mined by one of a handful of pools, if any pool started accepting / creating spam transactions, individual miners would quickly leave that pool.
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:20:21
But you have to compare apples-to-apples.  A confirmed Bitcoin transaction is "funds spendable in the bank."  That does NOT happen 60,000x per second on the Visa network.  The Visa network can perform a large number of UNCONFIRMED transactions per second, but so can the Bitcoin network.

Great post. 
A lot of the economics of Bitcoin are based (possibly naively) around the idea that in the Bitcoin world everybody benefits from higher coin prices so everybody chooses to act in accordance with whatever decision brings about higher coin value. 
In reality, the ability to short Bitcoin, as well as the incentive to profit from Bitcoin's competition and alternatives, may drive many people in the Bitcoin world to seek a lower coin value.
Whether this represents a fundamental flaw in the Bitcoin concept or not will remain to be seen.

I agree wholeheartedly.
Without someone setting fire to the issue, it is likely that debate will simmer on the back burner until things really start to come unglued.  Big software projects are usually like this.  Slowly worsening problems usually just linger until they're 
What Gavin and Mike et al have done, is to push the issue to the front burner, to "call the vote" as it were.  And ultimately this will be seen as having been a good thing.
Were I in Gavin's position, I would understand that it is shockingly unlikely that I will have all the best ideas, and I would not try to engineer the final solution myself, because it's 99% certain that someone else out there has a better one.
Instead the role of a "lead developer" on a project as big as Bitcoin is to spark debate and surface ideas, and evaluate them in a fair light, and implement the best ideas most likely to move consensus forward.  Hopefully this is what is unfolding.
Edit: hmm... considering a bit.  Had the 20MB proposal not been foisted on us, it's very likely that "organic" debate would have probably coalesced around a much more modest number - 2MB.  It's "doubling" (which feels like a lot) and it's still a conservative number that will limit abuse / attacks.  Instead, he proposed 10X that number - 20MB.  What this has done, is cause us to stop asking "how much do we need to increase it right now" and start asking "what's the maximum we can all live with."
That's a "discussion-reframing" move if I've ever seen one.

Well this is interesting.
Reading all the responses to my discussion:
On the one hand, my idea is wrong, because if we allow miners to set any value they like, then everyone will just set arbitrary values and the network will create an infinitely large number of forks and die in flames (I disagree).
On the other hand, you're here arguing that allowing miners to adjust the value on the fly is totally unnecessary, as they could "just as easily" run modified code that tolerated larger blocks.
Well folks, you can't have it both ways.  One or both of these assumptions seem false on their face.  If giving control to users over this limit is a bad idea, then how do we reconcile the fact that they've had the control to change the limit the whole time?
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:27:53
It will only be exploited if it's worth it to exploit it.
The 1MB limit has created an exploitable attack vector for several years, as the stress test recently demonstrated.  Why is it not being exploited horribly?
This is why I am in favor of the 20MB+50%/yr solution.  I do not think the same conditions that led to the need for the original limit still exist today.  If they did, then we would have been seeing attacks on the 1MB limit for years now.

I think it's a given that the larger the block, the higher the orphan rate.
I think it's therefore a given that if we increase block size, orphans will increase.
What I don't think is a given, is that in the long run this helps miners in China. 
If I had a sizeable amount of hashpower in the USA or Europe on very fast Internet, it seems like all other things equal, larger blocks would give me an advantage vis a vis Chinese miners.

This is a very dangerous decision.
The price of Bitcoin is supported by a handful of critical factors, key among them:
1. Controlled supply
2. Irreversible transactions
These are aspects of the design explicitly detailed in the white paper as being critical for the economic success of the coin.
From the link:


pressure to increase the blocksize, particularly from the users creating the most valuable transactions.
"better functioning fee market" = "higher fees"
"pressure to increase the blocksize" = "user demand"
"users creating the most valuable transactions" = "financial middlemen"
This sentence is a dead give-away what the true intentions are: to limit the transactional capacity of the network, creating artificial scarcity for transactions that drives up fees and crowds ordinary "P2P" users out of the system.
Here's my rewrite of the above sentence:
"Higher fees will help drive individual users off the blockchain, forcing them to use financial middlemen in order to actually interact with it."

Re: decentralization, I complete agree.
So.  What's magic about 1MB? Wouldn't the network be *more* decentralized with a *lower* limit?  Shouldn't we implement it?
If the block size is raised, it will not negate the work by "people working *right now*" (and hats off to all of them) to increase transaction throughput.  As you point out, increasing the block size to 2 or 8 or 20MB only buys a little time.  If someone delivers a solution that allows Bitcoin to gracefully scale to 10X or 100X or 1000X the current number of transactions, have no doubt it will be welcomed regardless of the block size.

Right. I understand that block size limits are a counter DoS concept. I question that they add value.
The network can be effectively DoSed right now *because* of the block size limit - by stuffing the 1MB blocks. **Why has that never happened? Why don't we fear it?** During the recent stress test we saw transactions basically stop while all the chaff transactions were clogging the 1MB limit. Why aren't aggressors exploiting this? It's basically the same attack.

Good post Mike.
The one thing that I would add, is that the limit was added originally as a knee-jerk anti-spam device, which is no longer needed.
If there is one thing for sure this has shown us without question that bolting on knee-jerk features like a 1MB block limit should only occur if there is no other choice to save the network.   Maybe it was the best alternative at the time, but let's all acknowledge the pain of that decision before we ever make another one like it.

I can't speak about Greece, but I do know plenty about Italy.
In Italy there is no fear of technology but card payments are still rare and cash is still king.
Why?  It's very simple:  It's because card payments expose your transactions to the government, and Italians trust neither their government nor their banking system.  Something like 50% of the economy is estimated to be "al nero" ("in the black", or "unreported").

Possible in the abstract.
Since coins can be transacted on either chain, as soon as one chain shows even a little more value than the other, all market participants have the same incentive to transact on that chain.
Game it out.  The planned updates require that 75% of peers be running updated code before a block &gt;1 MB is ever allowed.  So let's assume that the code is divisive, and some people refuse to run the updated code.  *Worst* case, 25% of the network resists and stays on the old code, which means that 75% of the network has decided to move to the new chain.  The "holdouts" are welcome to keep running the old chain with a 1MB limit, and people can transact on that, but the value of the coins on that chain is going to plummet.  Therefore, this will not happen.  Once a supermajority is reached, there's almost no chance that a viable second coin will come out of it.  Arbitrage will force the value of the deprecated coin to zero very quickly.

Two arguments to this.
First, no forks occur until (actual_block_size) &gt; (max_blocksize).  As long as users set a max_blocksize sufficiently large to never reject anything like a "normal" block, then there will be zero forks.  For example if we roll out a client tomorrow that has a config file with a default set to 20MB, with average block sizes just reaching 1MB, then all "otherwise valid" blocks will continue to be accepted.  No forks.
Moreover: if users control the parameter themselves, they all have an incentive to ensure that all blocks are always accepted unless they are so otherwise abusive that it is likely that the economic majority will also refuse them.  So nobody has to be convinced to change a limit in lockstep, because each user has an incentive to ensure that they do not falsely reject a block.

@_date: 2015-06-14 18:00:06
Thank you for replying nullc.
I have a few issues with your reply but I'll start this way.
You assume there is not strong consensus on MAX_BLOCKSIZE.  If instead the overwhelming majority of miners set their configuration to "20MB" it would produce the same chain as hard-coding the value.
To have the network state diverge problematically, *it would require significant divergence of consensus*.  The problem with your argument is that strong consensus is *already required* in order to effectively *hard code* MAX_BLOCKSIZE.  If that consensus does not exist, then miners can simply choose to not run updates that raise the block size.  OR they could instead choose a code fork that imposes an even smaller or larger limit.  This does not happen today
By moving the value to a configurable file you allow the exact same consensus dynamic to evolve without requiring changing a line of code.  TL;DR you can't impose consensus with code, instead, consensus will dictate the code.  Might as well get the programmer out of the loop.
On a different line of thought:
You also assume a network filling blocks at or near the theoretically maximum supportable by the network.  Miners should set their limits at or near whatever constitutes the maximum supportable by their configuration.
If a miner chooses a limit that's a little lower than the rest of the network, then that miner risks rejecting blocks that the rest of the network considers valid.  This produces a condition where each miner seeks to accept the largest "economically rational" block in the same way that they do today within the 1MB limit: each miner competes for the block reward and some economically rational number of transactions that optimizes fees versus block size.
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:09:53
Yes, and yet it is necessary for all but the most trivial changes.
If you expect all stakeholders to always agree, then you will always fail. Conflict is inevitable. This is how it is resolved, as Satoshi wrote, "They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance ofvalid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."

You are describing a world in which everybody just arbitrarily picks a random number and assigns it to the limit.
The purpose of the limit, is to prevent a malicious miner from sending you an "infinitely large" block, and preventing you from wasting effort trying to validate it or experiencing some sort of overflow condition.
An honest miner sets the largest value that protects himself from malicious actors, and accepts and fills economically competitive blocks.
If we're specifically talking about dishonest mining pools with hashpower advantage otherwise manipulating their limit in order to reject otherwise valid blocks in order to double-spend, their activity will be outed on the blockchain *exactly* as it would be if they were double-spending "normally" with their hashpower advantage and the market and network will react against the malicious miner just like any other malicious mining activity.
Miners without hashpower advantage only hurt themselves by rejecting blocks considered valid by the majority of the network.

Each user needs to *be able to* validate blocks to keep miners honest.  This does *not* mean that every user *must* validate blocks.
This is just like open source software.  Every user *is able to* validate the source code.  This does not mean that every user *must* validate the source code.
As long as the blockchain can be downloaded and validated by a reasonable percentage (not even a majority) of users, then miners will be kept honest.

I don't agree with this.  I believe what you are describing is the economically optimal block size that miners choose.  A rational miner would not reject incoming blocks just because they happened to be larger than this size.


No, forks only occur if the actual blocks being mined were larger than the threshold set by individual miners.  This would rarely ever happen.  A rational miner has an incentive to accept all blocks of otherwise valid transactions and thus would set the MAX_BLOCKSIZE at a very high level.

If all users agree on the size of a block, then they will all set the same configuration value, and thus achieve the same result.  However, updating this value will require far less friction in the future.
It is in my opinion that, left to choice, miners will opt to select a limit high enough to, essentially, never reject a block unless "extraordinary conditions" are met.
"Which conditions?" you ask, to which I reply, "not all conditions are knowable, which is why such rules should not be poured into code."
Now the above assumes that the community can reach consensus on max allowable block size.
If instead it is the case that the community does not and cannot reach consensus on a limit, then what will occur instead is that it will gridlock around changing the hard-coded value instead.
Either model requires consensus, the only thing that changes is how they break.

This is precisely why, given the option to control the maximum acceptable inbound block size, no miner would voluntarily choose to reject it, unless it was truly out-of-bounds.
In other words, each miner would set a max blocksize for incoming blocks that was high enough to never reject any block that was in other regards "valid".

My argument is simply that perhaps "maximum block size" is *not* a validity rule, it is an anti-overflow-attack threshold value and does not belong clumped together with actual validity rules like "the transactions are well-formed" and "the proof of work met the difficulty target."
You can't mine a "valid" block if the structure is nonsense or you didn't prove your work.  But valid blocks were mined prior to the bolt-on of the 1MB limit and they're still valid today.

I think your logic is mostly / entirely correct as an "instantaneous" explanation of what happens when blocks get larger.

Mining hardware depreciates very quickly. New miners have to be provisioned and installed continuously, and hardware becomes rapidly obsolete.

I would support the concept of a "network efficiency coefficient" that takes into account *all* efficiency factors including transaction and confirmation times, costs to run full nodes, etc. as mining costs are just a piece of the cost equation - and time and QoS must be held constant as one can always lower costs by lowering quality of service.
The original metric is still mostly a red herring at best and a serious deception at worst.
At least we should call it "network efficiency"

Yes and that's definitely a plus. But I still have some unanswered questions about ApplePay. 
So Apple gets a cut of all transactions according to sources I've read.  Does this mean they act as a central clearinghouse? If not how can they account for the transactions? I guess they could just trust visa to operate transparently...
As I understand it you can enter your card information by photographing your cards. Is this true? 
I wonder if malware could snag that camera image?  Otherwise if you type it, I wonder if malware can intercept it then? I wonder if it's possible to intercept a transaction and attempt a double spend?


At the end of the day it's still visa transactions going over the same old legacy network. Bitcoin also uses strong public /private key cryptography but doesn't subject transactions to that network.  I think it's debatable that ApplePay is safer.

In the meantime this is going to force Bitcoins tentacles into every investment firm on Wall Street. They will be profiting from it but having to compete with firms and exchanges all around the world from unregulated to highly regulated. In the meantime Bitcoin will entrench itself and capital will flow out of legacy markets and into dark / unregulated markets, because no law can prevent the movement of a Bitcoin.

I'm so annoyed and tired by "experts" releasing their statements to the effect that while Bitcoin is obviously brilliant and useful it is clearly doomed to fail because it doesn't fit in with established financial paradigms. I'm leaving this here so that I can link back to it as a canned response.
If you listened to experts, you would have really misunderstood the future.
Here are some of my favorites.
"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers." -- Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, 1943.
"Where a calculator on the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, computers in the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and weigh only 1.5 tons." -- Popular Mechanics, 1949
"I have traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked with the best people, and I can assure you that data processing is a fad that won't last out the year." -- The editor in charge of business books for Prentice Hall, 1957.

"The Americans have need of the telephone, but we do not. We have plenty of messenger boys." -- Sir William Preece, chief engineer of the British Post Office, 1876.
"The wireless music box has no imaginable commercial value. Who would pay for a message sent to nobody in particular?" -- David Sarnoff's associates in response to his urgings for investment in the radio in the 1920s.
"While theoretically and technically television may be feasible, commercially and financially it is an impossibility." --Lee DeForest, inventor.
"The concept is interesting and well-formed, but in order to earn better than a 'C', the idea must be feasible." -- A Yale University management professor in response to Fred Smith's paper proposing reliable overnight delivery service. (Smith went on to found Federal Express Corp.)

Oh shit. It's the "centralize / decentralize" argument again.
Networks beat centralization in every case in which they can be applied, as they allow for a hybrid model. An easy example is computing. In the beginning, all was centralized (mainframes). Then came decentralization (PCs). Now there is a network (internet) which allows for the coexistence of resources that are both "centralized" (server farms) and "decentralized" (a zillion devices). Non-technological examples abound in industries as diverse as manufacturing (once totally vertically integrated, now a powerful supply chain network), banking, airlines, healthcare, and fast food.
That network effects beat pure centralization is the reason even a true monopoly performs outsourcing.

I get your point but it's a bad analogy.
With fish there is always an incentive to keep fishing because as overfishing occurs and fish become scarce, your fish become more valuable, increasing your incentive to keep fishing.
With Bitcoin, as soon as there is a 51% attack and the network loses trust in the protocol, the value of the Bitcoins you earned in your 51% attack will plummet quickly towards zero. You're better off just mining.

These things are only possible with an open, decentralized blockchain. 
Centralized / membership only blockchains not secured by a market based mining network don't enjoy the security benefits of Bitcoin or other open blockchains.
Perhaps you could be more specific about how you see internal blockchains being used. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:29:42
Forgive me for putting words in your mouth, but your position is tantamount to saying, "there *should be* no increase of the blocksize until at least sometime in 2016."
Why do you think you can say with confidence that "no increase of the blocksize will be needed until sometime in 2016?"  I am genuinely curious to read your assessment that leads you to this conclusion.
Edit: it seems patently obvious that increasing the transaction throughput of the network - slow as it is - should always be a top priority, and that the code should always strive to maximize the capacity insofar as possible.  It seems to me that some devs do not share this view, and I am genuinely curious, why not?

1. Buy bitcoin at kiosk. After first interaction with kiosk (account creation) , process *much* faster than waiting at wu. Pay fraction of the cost versus wu.
2. Transmit bitcoin to family in Nepal. They receive it within minutes of purchase. Transaction fee $0.06 or thereabouts. 
3. Convert to local fiat, paying a fraction of the fee vs wu.
It's easy to see how the process could be a lot simpler and faster than wu. The challenge will be to offer currency exchange rates that beat wus markup. Major exchanges like coinbase charge 1-3% for fiat conversion. Double that (since you have to convert twice) and you're still in the 5% range - far less than wu.

Most folk at that level (1) either don't actually come from an IT/ engineering background at all, or (2) by the time they rise to a level of management suitable for the title "CIO" it's been so long since they wrote a stored procedure or read a white paper, it's unrealistic to think they'd personally be able to properly vet the technology.

First off, for example, the largest Bitcoin exchange currently is Bitstamp. In Slovenia. New York regulators cannot enforce any laws on Slovenia. The rest of the world, and the rest of the USA, will be unaffected.
Secondly, suppose I represent an investment group which is looking to invest a large amount of assets in crypto. This group would prefer to keep its assets in a regulated transaction space a la legacy Wall Street and wants to know it can trade on a regulated high volume exchange like NASDAQ. Bitstamp and Bitfinex are not options for these players. They wish to invest amounts equal to Bitcoin's entire market cap and move those assets effortlessly with their other assets, which are traded on exchanges like NASDAQ.
This regulatory regime, or something like it (I don't think we've seen the final draft yet) will create the environment that legacy business is comfortable with, *without removing out of state options like Bitstamp.* If you prefer to work with fewer regulations, work outside of New York. It's a big world out there and New York will be competing with it, because Bitcoin flow effortlessly over borders. So exchanges in Austin, or Den Haag, will get to compete directly with NASDAQ. And trust me, New York regulators cannot set the regulatory regime in Austin much less Tokyo.
Now are you arguing that it hurts the market for (or adoption of) Bitcoin to make such a space a viable option and let market dynamics sort out the fallout?

If a Euro bank fails, the EU will be necessity have to create euro to backfill the financial losses, just like the USA in 2008.  The spectre of a catastrophe may be causing the relative rise of the dollar - note the position of US banks on this chart.
Why is this about Bitcoin?  Simple.  During the last financial crisis, Bitcoin did not exist.  When the next one comes, we should do what we can to be prepared to support an influx of new potential users.
Probably, most people will flock to the dollar.  But it's also conceivable that if the Bitcoin economy were more mature, some people could find better haven in Bitcoin.

EDIT: I feel the need to leave this here since people are coming in from other subs and failing to read what I'm writing.
TL;DR: "Money laundering" (like "tampering with evidence") *requires first that an underlying crime be committed.*  If you are mixing legally-gained Bitcoin, then by definition this is NOT "money laundering" and falls outside the scope of this discussion.
Also TL;DR: of course there are bad actors in law enforcement that apply this crime unfairly.  There are people that get wrongly charged with murder, too.  That doesn't invalidate murder as a crime.  I'm completely against the misuse of the charge of "money laundering" nor do I support the existing AML/KYC laws as they are currently being applied to Bitcoin.
That said:


Disagree. Obfuscating wrongdoing foils the public good.


By definition, it does. You can only "launder" dirty money.

*What in the world are you talking about?*
I gave you an actual example of a crime: theft.
If you steal money from someone, you harm them. If law enforcement must then track you down, arrest you, prosecute you, and punish you, that costs me and everyone else in the society.  If you launder the money, you exacerbate that cost. That is why it is also a crime to launder money.
For similar reasons it is also illegal to: drive a getaway car, run away from cops who arrest you, tamper with evidence, lie under oath, etc. All knowing attempts to hinder the *proper use of police activity* hurt all members of society and are generally illegal.
Note that by definition, laundering money requires you to have already committed an underlying crime. If you have not already illegally received money, you cannot possibly launder it, no matter what you do with it. Are you using a mixing service to obfuscate your legally-received Bitcoin? By definition this is NOT money laundering and is NOT what I'm taking about.
That was the alpha and omega of my point. Anything else you think I'm saying, I'm not.

Congratulations. 
This is handily the most salient counter I've ever read in over a decade of arguing this point.
The way I interpret your reply is probably not what you intend but it has made me think:
My primary issue is the seeming inequity of a company which profits from my work without compensating me. For example a film that grosses millions using my song without permission as its theme. 
You're the first person to make the case that for services like Grooveshark,  their profit is actually only profit on their value-added discovery service.  Since in this model the music itself costs nothing there will always be a competitor willing to provide the service accepting only the reasonable profits from their value-add. Grooveshark may in fact operate under this business model. So the market will ensure that my music is not abused. I can get behind this argument. I'm surprised I've never heard it before. 
I'll mull your reply. You may have been the first person to actually change my opinion about this. 
In the meantime,  1 beer please for this fine man and his well constructed, polite, strawman free argument.

The  critique of Bitcoin: "typical middle class Americans don't see a need to change payment systems to pay with their phones, since credit cards work just fine"
If this is a true statement, Apple will fail. 
If it is false, Apple will make another huge success short to mid term, but will also succeed in solving several long term problems for Bitcoin:
1. Convince consumers to ditch their plastic cards and merchants their card readers and everyone use phones instead.  Now all they have to do is switch apps and they're spending Bitcoin.
2. Roll out a nation's worth of infrastructure to support mobile payments.
3. Open the door to other centralized mobile payment competitors like Google or T-mobile  or Amazon (or more likely, about two million companies including banks etc) who will fragment the market.
4. Ultimately fail worldwide because while Apple might have the US market share to pull this off in the USA, whatever rival system rolls out for Android will own the ROW, further distancing the USA from the rest of the world's payment systems and increasing the utility of a truly international unifying payment system.

Basically, yes, that's a great way of looking at the question.  So one answer could simply be, "how much USD are sitting on all exchanges?"  Another limiting factor is availability of BTC to short, so also, how many of those are available?
That would at least represent the maximum amount of profit that a potential belligerent could make if the attack happened *now.*
Another question is, within reasonability limits, how much could an attacker realistically pump up the BTC and shorts on the market?  If I were going to attack, I'd try to get the market as hot as possible, so imagine we bubbled, and *then* the attacker shorted and attacked as we neared the new ATH?  That might represent the theoretical current maximum that an attacker could possibly hope to win, given a "perfect attack" situation.
I think knowing these numbers will help to understand the *actual financial incentive* facing a would-be attacker, thus helping us to understand the likelihood of this ever playing out in real life, or at least, for the forseeable future.
I've started a thread [over here]( to see if we could estimate these numbers.

The answer is right inside your analogy.
The blockchain - the fundamental innovation of Bitcoin - is akin to the internet itself, in that it is a core technology (you don't use it directly, you build things with it). Bitcoin represents the first real tangible thing you can do with the blockchain. In that regard Bitcoin is like email, the first tangible application of the internet. Which, protests by notwithstanding, dates to the early 1970s. It was *twenty-five years later* that mass adoption of email took place.
I first had email in 1984(ish) and the only people I could find who would use it with me were people that were every bit as marginalized as today's Bitcoiners. If you wanted to communicate in real time you picked up the phone.
And yes, technically something like 1 in 3 households had email by the mid 1990s but it was still not fully mainstream. For example in 2000 I started working for a Fortune 500 company that was *just rolling out email that year*. Not some mom and pop shop but a company with $8B in annual revenue.
And I will add that while 1/3 of  households technically had internet/email by the mid 1990s, what they were using were walled gardens like CompuServe and AOL. In 1995 it was very far from clear that the decentralized WWW we take for granted today was ever going to take off. Most people used AOL as though it WAS the entire internet, and it mostly was.
In short if you're young you have no idea of the length of time and the number of growing pains faced by the technology we all just take for granted today.

What was he trying to do? Establish Bitcoin as an alternative currency? Or just use it as a rail to move money in and out of Kenya a la remittance?
The first is clearly very unrealistic. The second is totally doable provided the regulatory environment is not too hostile and there's at least one working ethernet jack in the country.

If you want it to go up, you have to be prepared for it to go down. Or just buy a certificate of deposit. They only go up.
Nobody should be scared when it goes down because nobody should have more of their worth in it than they are willing to lose. *If you're scared it means you're doing it wrong.*

No, that's a lost/stolen credit card. I'm talking about stolen identities: where people use access to your online accounts to create new accounts in your name and spend on them. Far more difficult to fight. This is a lot more common than having your phone hacked and your Bitcoin stolen.
You don't stay up at night worrying about people creating accounts in your name do you? Why not?


I think so. It's not difficult. Print a paper wallet from a disconnected computer, transfer funds to it, make a backup, put in safe place, done.
This is a reasonably high level of security with very little effort.

LOL well if we look at a single moment of time then Bitcoin is perfectly stable and unchanging.

Having gone through your arguments I think I can synthesize our disagreements.
1. You treat Bitcoin as perfectly fungible whereas I don't. I believe that a lot of *30,000 guaranteed legal untainted coins* will command a premium for buyers like etfs who must manage risk.  You don't.
2. You believe there is no risk in slowly buying off market. Per my previous example, if you got an exclusive contract with the largest mining pool to buy everything they mined (and you can't, but let's imagine) at best it would take you 20 days to buy 30,000 coins. In the meantime you are exposed to the risk of a bull market run while at the same time forcing demand roughly equal to Willy onto the market. The price will definitely move on you. If you buy slower to minimize your impact on the market then you are even more exposed to a possible bubble.
Edit: and what happens if you're buying your coins at say 500/day for 60 days and a competing etf  learns of your acquisition? If I was your competitor i'd start buying on exchange and force up the price on you. Small purchases on the right exchange would kick you right in the balls.

Two questions:
What are you going to do with that money in the meantime?
If anyone actually *knew* when Bitcoin was going up, would they tell you?
Edit: let me break this down.
Bitcoin goes up on good news. It goes down on bad news. Like anything valuable and risky. Because people follow their emotion. The price can also change if something fundamentally changed about Bitcoin, say an important security risk is identified, or a new security feature is added. But mostly the price fluctuates based on news.
How can anyone know when the next good or bad news is coming? Tomorrow the Chinese could switch to using Bitcoin exclusively and the price goes up 10,000x. Or the USA decides to ban it completely and the price goes down 10,000x. Perhaps Argentina defaults and people there start frantically buying Bitcoin.
You would only "know"  what Bitcoin would do if you had good inside information about some development none of us knew about yet. If it was public knowledge, it would already be included in the price. So people with inside information would never tell, because it's only valuable when it's secret.
So the price today reflects the best guess of fair market value today that anyone without inside information can possibly have. You cannot "time" the market without inside information.
I don't mean to be insulting, but the fact that you would even be asking these questions indicates that you are probably a very immature "investor" looking to make fast money on Bitcoin. I put "investor" in quotes, because you aren't really investing, you're just gambling. Investors buy and sell on fundamentals, and usually hold for a long time.

The analogy is bad, but only because you are missing a key point.
You worked at an internet company 25+ years after the invention of the internet.
I remember the internet from the days of email and Usenet. Text-only systems that were so slow you could read faster than they could produce text.
If you had shown your grandmother that, she would have thought it was interesting, but wouldn't have seen its likely relevance to her.
Fast forward to the time you're talking about. Now there's HTTP. There are pictures. There's even rudimentary sound and lame video. People are able to access it from their own home. That was decades after the birth of the internet and the handful of applications that had been built for it.
There will be layers of applications and business models built on top of Bitcoin that cause the real revolution.

Prior to Bitcoin, if you and I wanted to engage in commerce, we had two options:
1. Perform the transaction in cash. This allows us to perform the transaction without an intermediary, but comes with all the problems of physical currency, namely that we physically have to exchange money.
2. Use an intermediary: bank, PayPal, etc. The overwhelming amount of commerce, including all e-commerce, requires an intermediary. *This requires us to both trust the intermediary* and they are not always trustworthy. This service also costs money to perform.
Bitcoin provides a third option: one without the trust-establishing intermediary, so it has the advantages of cash, but which isn't physical, so it has the advantages of cashlessness.
TL;DR: So it allows you and I to engage in commerce without an intermediary to establish trust
Edit: I reread your question- I think you're asking how Bitcoin solves the problem of trust regarding the *other part of the transaction* - ie, if you give me money (Bitcoin, dollars, etc) in exchange for a good or service, how do we guarantee the good or service has been exchanged. Bitcoin doesn't attempt to solve this problem, just like your bank doesn't attempt to solve it, though interesting Bitcoin solutions exist (ie multisig).

No.  This ruling doesn't make purchases with bitcoin tax-free, it makes them not subject to double-taxation.
Many people are misunderstanding this ruling.  Here's my interpretation.
When you buy an item, there are two transfers:
.1. the transfer of the item to the buyer
.2. the transfer of the money to the seller
Sales tax is collected on transfer  not transfer   This ruling confirms that the same will be true for Bitcoin. 
Example:  If you go in a shop and buy a lawnmower for 1BTC, then the merchant still pays a tax for the transfer of the lawnmower to you, but you are not responsible for paying tax for "selling" the merchant your bitcoin.
Interpretation: this is a responsible ruling that is good for Bitcoin.

You keep saying that but I don't think you understand what you're saying. 
If 3600 Bitcoin are created every day, then unless demand increases by 3600 coins per day, the money supply *and the price* are both inflationary.

Hijacking to add my two cents. 
The idea of a centralized organization making use of the blockchain to support a centralized application is the wrong tool for the job. The legacy database and application tools are more efficient tools for operating within a "ring of trust" like a group of banks or other businesses. 
The blockchain effectively solves or mitigates the "Byzantine Generals Problem". That's the whole point of the mining, the coins, everything.  It's a lot of work to solve or mitigate that specific problem, and the key point that needs to be made here, is that *this is not a problem faced by organizations operating within a ring of trust*. 
Bitcoin solves the problem of how to assure accounting consensus *without requiring a ring of trust in the first place*.

This is so naive it hurts.
If corrupt politicians (and let's make no mistake, Greece's problems are corruption and politics) were willing or able to "fix their problems slowly" then Greece would never have had trouble to begin with, given that they had their own money for literally centuries.
*If it was possible to be addressed slowly it would have been addressed under the drachma.*
The fact is that as long as corrupt politicians in places like Greece and Italy (and the USA) can ignore the structural problems (which they benefit from) and daub some inflation on the problem to get themselves reelected, they will do so, and problems will just get worse.
Every. Single. Fucking. Time.

Quite simply he meant exactly what he said: You could create a blockchain that used as inputs to its mining algo the preferences set by twelve bankers. Or any other set of inputs. Bitcoin is just one of an infinite number of different blockchain mining algos. Thousands of alts have already been created, and a coin with mining controlled by the inputs of twelve bankers would be just one such alt. 
The thing is, essentially nobody would mine that coin, just like essentially nobody mines the thousands of alts already in existence.

No, not anymore. But for many years PayPal was just an intermediary to a bank account and didn't work with credit cards so those of us who were forced to link our bank accounts to PayPal already think of it that way.


Yes but IRL anyone who really uses PayPal as intended isn't just using it to make a one time purchase on a credit card. If you user eBay etc you will set up a proper PayPal account with your bank details, shipping information, etc.
But you have a PayPal account, you know all this already.


If you're going to pay with a credit card why go to the trouble of setting up PayPal either? Because you want the convenience PayPal will offer. Same with Bitcoin.


I know you aren't. That's why I'm starting to think you are just trolling. You know better than to believe what you're saying.
Coinbase has a more time consuming process for creating an account then PayPal does *assuming* you don't want to connect your PayPal account to your bank. That is true.

No, nobody was worried that the dea would break down their door.

It was publicly available. At least, I had dial up 300kbps access in my home by 1983. And it was all over college campuses long before that.
Bitcoin is likewise "publicly available" but there is very limited availability: only a tiny handful of reputable ways to get it, and few places to spend it, and plenty of knowledge friction in between.
When Bitcoin is as ubiquitous as the internet was in 1995 then you should compare it to the internet in 1995. For now it looks much more like the internet in 1980.

FWIW Italy has roughly 70% home ownership with very few mortgages and strong stable property values. I bring this up as a counterexample because it's an interesting object lesson: the Italian economy has been in the crapper for years, but since individuals hold very little personal debt, they are much more insulated from the downturn.
Note: I have an MBA and took plenty of econ classes; I'm well aware of the role of debt in the economy. Now that I'm older, I question the teaching. Specifically I question the idea that a savings-based economy is unsound. I don't agree any longer that something that is good for the individual (savings) is bad for the economy; or that something that is good for the economy (more debt) would involve something that is bad for the individual.
Edit: note that the Italian economy is in the crapper because of corruption and a bloated bureaucracy; I've never seen the claim that the underlying issue is lack of personal debt. And clearly they cannot take on more federal debt.

What? EBay and Amazon were competing against the entire brick and mortar economy which was thousands of years old by using a completely unproven model.
*Nobody* thought eBay would fly when it first appeared. "I'm going to send money to some anonymous, faceless identity God-knows-where, and just trust that they'll send me the thing I'm buying? Get real."
There is no need to go head to head against the establishment with a big money assault. Just build a better mousetrap whose core strength is decentralization. BOOM there's no way for any single player to compete in the long run.

Take a look at the three month price chart. 
See that 50% run-up around June 1? That's largely caused by folks taking out loans to buy bitcoin in speculation of a bubble by Aug 1.
Remember the SR coin auction? A number of players wanted to get a lot of coin but didn't want to pay that 50% markup that the speculators had just added to the price.
Now if you have that kind of money, and want to buy Bitcoin, but are only willing to pay in the low 500s for it, all you need to do is drive the exchange price down at the correct time, and many of those margin traders are forced to sell at market prices (margin call). This further tanks the price and adds to bearish momentum. Edit: if you do it right, the margin calls lower the price further, forcing even more margin calls, resulting in a self sustaining cascade. 
This is a time honored trading strategy by people who know a lot more about this stuff than me. 
So a couple of days ago the sell off got catalyzed by a large, suspicious sell on bitfinex. Note that bitfinex is one of the exchanges that allows margin trading and is very popular with the crowd.
How suspicious was the order? Suspicious enough that it tripped circuit breakers on that exchange. Suspicious enough that the ceo of bitfinex came to to talk about it. 
Now we're seeing some similar dumps on other exchanges - exchanges which offer margin trading, thin order volume, and this time no circuit breakers.
Meanwhile fundamentals have never been better. There really isn't any bad news.

The dollar is the "world's reserve currency" but through most of the world you cannot and will not ever be able to spend it.

You also keep forgetting important facts in this discussion.
You forget that no single miner earns 3600 coins a day. As the largest pool, ghash earns roughly 1500 coins a day. But of course **those are already under contract to someone else.** If you want them you'll have to **beat the price.** And assuming they'll sell you everything they make (and they won't *unless you outbid all their other buyers*), that would still require you to wait 20 days to accumulate what you could buy *today.*
And that's if you can convince the largest pool to sell you everything they make. That will not happen at discount pricing. So instead you buy from smaller pools over a much longer time frame. And time is money and risk. I'll illustrate:
Assuming our whale could get an exclusive with ghash, they would be displacing whoever has been buying all those coins. That demand will go... Where, exactly? One way or another demand will be pushed back onto the market and *prices will start rising.* But you still have 19 more days before you've bought your 30,000 coins!
And let's not forget about the TA which is strongly pointing to the fact that we are entering a bull market.  Are you really going to risk *buying into a bubble?*
**So if you happen to believe that over the course of purchasing from miners the price is likely to rise then you become willing to buy above current market price now.**

You are right: this is important.  Here's the rub.
Airports like any retail space have noncompetitive agreements built into the rent contracts.  For example if I open a Starbucks in an airport my rent contract will specify that no other coffee shops can open in the same terminal or within some radius of my shop.
Since all international airports have currency exchanges already, it's very likely that a Bitcoin ATM would be treated as prohibited under this sort of rent contract.
Of course all contracts are different and there are exceptions to everything but this is the friction I think you're going to run into.
Now - will hate this, but if there are such barriers, here's how I would overcome this: tell the airport landlord that if the currency exchange doesn't offer BTC conversion, then a Bitcoin ATM isn't actually in competition with it.  IOW, force the currency exchanges to convert / sell Bitcoin if they want to keep an ATM out.

Even trying to buy $1M would send the price to the moon. You can send $10 no problem, so at least it works for pizza.
Now let's say that each Bitcoin is worth $10M. You need buy only one. Easy peasy. Works just as well for pizza, too.

I think others have explained what an ETF is. Here's why you should care.
People have invested in gold for thousands of years.  So you'd think that everyone who wanted to own gold for investment purposes would already have some, right?  You'd think surely after thousands of years the market would be more or less saturated, right? 
When the first gold ETF launched in 2003,  *one billion dollars* of capital moved into the gold market *in only three days.*
Before I get accused of hyping: my point is to illustrate that ETFs have the ability to bring lots of new players into the market, even if the market is old and mature like gold.

Good point.  You're young and smart.  As you get older, you'll find yourself thinking of larger sums as "pocket change."
You're also part of the generation that has only known ubiquitous use of debit cards.  In fact I also rarely carry cash in the USA, since debit cards are frankly easier.  But I also travel, and in many countries, cash is still king, and ATMs are rarer and still charge fees, so it's not unusual for me to always have a few hundred dollars on me.
Before about 25-30 years ago, this was the way of the world.  You carried the cash you might need on your person at all times.  If you needed to spend money and didn't have cash or maybe a blank check in your wallet (and not everyplace would take your check), good luck getting any cash on the spur of the moment.  After 4PM?  Weekend?  Cash a check at the grocery store, probably max $50.  Any number of people would typically carry $50-$500 on their person all the time.

I would argue that the effect on price could in fact be significant even at the levels you suggest. When demand is already high relative to supply, an additional 10% of artificial demand could cause a substantial rise in price, or could exacerbate a black swan event (like China entering the market) significantly.
Remember that price lies on a curve, linear movement in demand can cause exponentiation in price.

Or we might say, they are stabilizing the value by acting as a ballast against exuberant run-ups in the market...


Have you considered how self-centered and insulting you sound? Without these early adopters, you would never have heard of Bitcoin. These are people who invested their money in something that was widely considered foolish and worthless, and so they took a great risk. And/or they are people who operated as miners very early on, when the reward for mining a block was valued in fractions of a penny.
Also, why do you think the early adoption phase is over? Do you think the market for Bitcoin is already saturated?

You bought @ $700, now it's $350, you've lost 50%.
I mean, I guess it's worse than IBM (down 33% in the last 3 months).  The last time I lost 50% that fast was buying SNE in 2008, lost about 60% in the four or so months I happened to hold it.
But, these are blue chip stocks, not something as risky as bitcoin, with such well-known volatility.  Of course, we're seeing a lot less volatility this year compared to last, but it's still an emerging market and very undercapitalized.
Point is, losing 50% this quickly on something as volatile as Bitcoin shouldn't shock anyone - it's why most everyone here will chant like a mantra, "don't invest more than you can afford to lose."
Question for the room: "is cryptocurrency as a 'thing' going away any time soon?"  Obvious answer, "No."
So then, we should be holding some crypto as an investment hedge.  Which one to hold?  I'm wanting to buy "the concept of crypto" not any one particular implementation.
For an investor, this is easy.  Take a weighted average of the coins in [this group](  For my purposes, I exclude any with less than 20% overall coin market cap.  At this point, that leaves only Bitcoin.
So I hold Bitcoin.  If something comes along that starts to approach it in liquidity and cap then I'll pay attention to that.
If the price moves down, I start to consider buying more.  I want to hold 1-2% of my portfolio in a weighted blend of proven cryptos.  If the price sags, that just triggers me to buy.
Hope this helps.

Good post. 
Most of keeps looking at Bitcoin from Joe Consumer's point of view, and keep missing Joe Merchant's point of view.
Bitcoin: transaction "approval" takes seconds, "funds spendable" and "transaction finalization" takes minutes
Credit cards: transaction "approval" takes seconds, "funds spendable" takes days and "transaction finalization" takes months.
A card transaction can be reversed for months after the sale. According to Visa 120 days or longer.
[Source]( 
120+ days is in fact the relevant date to be discussing. Here's why.
Consider a POS sale, at the terminal.
As a merchant, when you send me a bitcoin transaction with a 0.0001 btc transaction fee and my client sees the transaction, there's an extreme likelihood that the transaction will go through. *That's all the approval most transactions will ever need in a POS situation.*
This is akin to getting a card approval on a credit card. As the merchant, you don't KNOW that you didn't just get a fraudulent charge, and the funds haven't hit your account yet, but it's good enough verification for most transactions.
Now with Bitcoin there is the question of a fraud attempt in the form of a double spend. In ten minutes, you will typically be able to verify that the transaction wasn't fraudulent. By then the funds are "in your account." *Spendable and finalized in 10 minutes.*
With credit cards it's a whole different story. The funds aren't typicallyst spendable in your account for several *days*. And the charge can be fraudulently reversed for *months*. From an accounting point of view, that's a terrific liability by comparison. Particularly if you're in a business that is targeted by fraud.
Hope this helps everyone understand the tangible, real world benefits of Bitcoin to merchants.

By the way, I was not responding to your other points because I wasn't taking issue with them. However if you'd like, I will.
You keep making these broad generalizations that lending will be *impossible* with Bitcoin since it is deflationary.  
More difficult, sure. I would argue that's a good thing: lenders in the USA lend far too much money, and consumers spend far too much of the bank's money wastefully (in a wealth-reducing manner) on themselves. (Edit: I would make the case that any time a creditor lends money for something unproductive, that is an inefficient loan that should not have been made.)  With a currency inflating at even 3% per year even a risk that loses money at 2% is preferable to not lending the money at all. Some of us believe that's harmful lending. If Bitcoin becomes a more dominant currency, lending will tighten. You say that's bad, I say that's good, we agree to disagree, have a nice day.
But lending is clearly not *impossible* with a deflationary currency as you keep stridently asserting. For most of the history of Western money, gold was the default currency. Gold is deflationary. Lending existed throughout the time gold was used. Therefore deflationary currency does not rule out lending.  QED.

Well, no.  I've already mentioned one: currency wars. Tie a nation's existence to a money that it doesn't control, and you can bury it. That reason alone is a showstopper. Many others exist. 


Only *after* having paid out billions in block rewards to build a vast mining network, which could never have been built on TX fees alone (and which you rightly point out might still fall on its face one day in the future when block rewards end).
So back to my earlier question: you roll out DollarCoin, now you need miners. But anyone wanting to mine will make more money mining a valuable coin that pays block rewards. So who mines DollarCoin?
I think everyone goes through a learning stage where this (crypto -fiat) seems like a plausible argument. I also entertained it. But if you game it out, it doesn't work.
Strapping a blockchain on a fundamentally centralized problem (like fiat money) is like adding carburetors to your horse. You say it will offer the benefits of decentralization. (1) no it won't and (2) decentralization isn't a benefit if your goal is preservation of centralization. All the things that Bitcoin brings are LIABILITIES in the current system.

This is the best explanation for the price disparity on Gox at that time that I have heard so far.
Everyone in the know - definitely everybody that visits this easily-accessible forum - knew that Gox was in trouble. Warnings were posted daily. And yet *demand for coins on Gox* was so high with respect to all the other exchanges that prices remained at a ~20% premium.
Every day there was a post on asking why, since it was so apparent that Gox was ailing, were prices so much higher there? Many different explanations were proffered all with varying degrees of plausibility, but none ring quite as true as this one.

What nobody on this sub seems to realize is that because you are correct, we should be embracing these regulations.
They create a new, highly regulated space in which Bitcoin can operate *in addition to* all the other spaces out there, from totally unregulated (ie. a Dark exchange), loosely regulated exchanges (ie. Den Haag, Tokyo), and highly regulated "legacy-compliant" exchanges like NASDAQ.
In this way there will be instant liquidity channels from the least regulated to the most regulated exchanges. This helps Bitcoin in unimaginable ways, without taking away from what is already available.

Network security in Bitcoin is all about the ability for all nodes to receive the same transactions at the same time. The faster more nodes reach agreement on transactions, the more secure the network. Here the best model is broadcasting. 
Internet /TCP/IP is ultimately a terrible medium for broadcasting because it's impossible for lots of receivers to receive the same transmission simultaneously without introducing latency.  With radio however all transactions can be broadcast to all nodes in virtually real time, which makes timestamps very trustworthy and increases security.  As long as the radio network is trustworthy (and ultimately it's arguably as trustworthy as the Internet backbone) it is a huge plus. 
Additionally nothing is lost because the existing Internet backbone still carries the transactions as well.  It's a very complimentary system.

This is clearly your thesis. 
May I challenge it with some questions? 
**Example one:**
I'm ready to sell 1000 btc right this second on bitfinex. I'm watching the spot price and, for reasons my own, I'm going to place a market sell order once the price hits my target. *I have no order on the books*. My finger is on the RETURN key. Am I providing market liquidity? Why or why not? 
**Example two:**
I have a 1000 btc sell order as a sell wall on btc-e. I have no intention of selling whatsoever. I'm just waving a flag at the market to try to move the price. Am I providing market liquidity? Why or why not? 
**Example three:**
I bought 1000 btc at $100 on coinbase (edit: or better, localbitcoins) because in my estimation based on the technology and the potential I think the market value is easily over $100,000 in five years. I plan on aggressively using the Bitcoin when they reach the target price but am saving them for this event. I have made predictions about where the market will be over the course of those five years. If my predictions don't hold within my specified time frames, I will sell back on coinbase (edit: or localbitcoins) at current market price.
Am I providing market liquidity or not? Why? 
Hopefully this will stimulate further discussion.

Depends. 
For example. Do you think the best use cases for Bitcoin are currently in the USA? I don't. And Apple's announcement, whatever it is, will not initially be a global payments system, as they have poor overall market penetration outside the USA. So I don't really see it as a true competitor. 
It will also not compete with Bitcoin in other ways. 
For example I suspect it will offer little to nothing in the way of a remittances solution. As it will almost certainly require the Apple account be tied to a bank or credit account, it won't do anything to help the unbanked. Etc.
If you think that Bitcoin was ever going to succeed by going straight for the "broad middle" of the payments industry in the USA, Apple looks like a threat, because that's where Apple will go. 
 If instead, like me, you think that Bitcoin will keep eating away at edge cases until it finally achieves market significance, then Apple is good news: they won't address edge cases well, they'll convince people it's finally time to ditch plastic cards in favor of smartphones, and they'll convince merchants to have good mobile payments infrastructure Bitcoin can leverage.

What an insufferable twat you are. I used the phrase "the end" simply to signify the end of my extremely simple point: debt &lt;&gt; wealth. Period. Saying "the end" doesn't make me right. I'm just right. Debt is not wealth; instead, it is actually the converse of wealth. That is a simple, basic fact of accounting.
Your father took out a loan to start a business. He became wealthy not from the loan but from the business, and he did not become wealthy until he retired the loan and owned the business. Had he taken out a loan to buy a depreciable object, like a car, he would not become more wealthy, instead, he would become less wealthy. Debt in and of itself is the opposite of wealth. Read an accounting book.
You keep making the argument that with deflationary currency like Bitcoin loans will be impossible. Past performance is no indicator of future gains, but i don't expect Bitcoin to always rise 8000% per year. If the price stabilizes, lending could be possible.
But if I believed as you do that Bitcoin is going to keep going up, then why would I take out a $500K loan like your Dad had to do. With Bitcoin growing at 8000% per year I would be stupid to invest in the business anyway, but if I wanted to, I merely would need to buy $10k in Bitcoin today and start planning my business. At 8000% growth, in a year I'll have all the cash I need to start the business.
Regardless, you seem to be frothing at the mouth as though I had personally attacked you. Reread the thread. I intended my original comment to be a side comment to the effect that debt is not wealth, and that ever more debt ultimately means ever less wealth.
Debt is not free money. As I pointed out before, when the bank loans your dad $500k, it is the bank whose wealth is increased. Your dad only becomes wealthy after retiring the debt, assuming the business succeeds, which most don't.
Should he instead follow the road of growth, and after a few years roll over the debt into a new $5M loan for expansion, he'll still not be wealthy until THAT loan is paid off, assuming he doesn't go back for $50M. This is the path most Americans (who carry on average about $15K in totally unproductive debt *per person*) and American businesses are on. It is not a wealth building path- at least, not for the  individual.
Works great if you're a bank though.

The most optimistic is that US productivity will outpace foreign productivity by more than the repayment amount, and the debt repayment will come with neither austerity nor inflation. This is hard for some people like myself to imagine, given the current debt/GDP ratio.
What is more likely is that productivity will not keep up, and our children will have to live under a mix of austerity and/or inflation. I think this is what was meant by "enslavement": op believes we are issuing debt expecting our children to suffer in the repayment.

God, I hate this stupid conversation with people who won't even use the fucking internet to learn what words mean.  First you need me to define crime for you, now you need me to define money laundering for you.
Why don't you put the bong down and look this shit up?
EDIT: sorry for being frustrated, but this is tiring, and I keep having to explain the same shit over and over.
From Wikipedia:
*Money laundering is the process whereby the proceeds of crime are transformed into ostensibly legitimate money or other assets.*
That is the textbook, dictionary definition of money laundering.  BY DEFINITION, the term means to "cleanse" illegally received money.  BY DEFINITION, it means to aid and abet in a crime.
Now, Wikipedia goes on to add:
*However in a number of legal and regulatory system the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial crime, and sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system, including terrorism financing, tax evasion and evading of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with source of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with destination of funds) when regulating the financial system.*
Now, isn't that what you're trying to say?  That so-called "AML" laws aren't targeting actual criminals who launder money?
I'll say it for the last time:
1. Real money laundering first requires an illegal act, if you aren't doing anything illegal, then *you didn't commit the act of laundering money* when you [bought Bitcoin] [used a mixing service] [sold Litecoin for Dogecoin] [etc]
2. So-called "AML" laws DO NOT TARGET ACTUAL MONEY LAUNDERING and I do not, nor have I ever, supported them
By analogy, if the state passed a statute that extended the definition of murder to "anyone who happened to be in the building when the murder was committed" then we would not start arguing that "murder doesn't hurt anyone" -- we would attack the specific statute by saying "being in the building when a murder was committed isn't actually murder and so this is a bad statute."
Legally buying Bitcoin or using a mixing service with legally acquired Bitcoin cannot be considered money laundering.  Instead of defending *actual money laundering*, which is a thing, we should be attacking bad statutes because they aren't targeting *actual money launderers.*

The market will have to price that in.  No doubt transaction fees will rise a few percent and reach an equilibrium vis-a-vis mining rewards which will come down to meet it.
Since the Nash equilibrium is "whatever the cheapest alternative transaction fee is" miners are forced by the market to accept the minimum profitable mining fee.  Mining network growth therefore should be expected to stop except for the turnover of hardware as it becomes obsolete and transaction fees just cover electricity costs for efficient hardware.  It will be a totally different world for miners then.
But in Bitcoin terms, you're speaking about a time so distant it's sci-fi.  If Bitcoin is still around in two decades it obviously did something very very right, and I'm sure the price will reflect that, so even the tiny trickle of coins miners continue to mine as block rewards out past 2100 could continue to be worth a lot to them.

Furthermore since transactions are very small chunks of data they could easily be sent over a legacy data network or even something like ham radio. It's a breakthrough of the highest order, actually.

Personally I don't think anonymity should be a feature of the coin which can only anonymize the transaction. It should be a feature of the network so that all the interaction between buyer and seller is anonymous, not just the payment bit.  As it is now, it's like a drug deal going on in public using cash. Sure the cash is untraceable but the other communication is visible.
TCP/IP is not made for anonymity and TOR while helpful is not perfect and is kind of a hack, technically.
We need a new network protocol and have for some time.

**This is a weak buttcoin lie that needs to die in a fire**
The current, typical, *actual* cost of a Bitcoin transaction is about $0.05.
This invented "transaction cost" you're referring to is expressed as monetary inflation.  It is not incurred at transaction time.  *It is borne by long term holders of the coin not by transactors.*
If you buy Bitcoin to remit and cash out immediately in a foreign country, you pay zero of this imaginary "cost", as you do not hold the coin long enough to feel any inflationary impact.
Bitcoin trolls are the only people in the world who think that monetary inflation should be treated as a per-transaction cost.  And they think this only applies to Bitcoin, as they would never, ever, ever calculate the inflation of the US dollar and tack it on to a transaction and call it a "fee".

So you are arguing that they can simply turn off the blockchain?  This is false. They could prevent some transactions from flowing,  but the logic is the same as for double spend: they could harass the network only as long as they are willing to pay miners to do their dirty work at great cost in the face of falling price.

Great addition.

Dear Superintendent Lawsky and General Counsel Syracuse,
I’m writing you today to express my concerns about the “BitLicense” proposal.
First however I wish to encourage you in the strongest of terms to watch this video: "Andreas M. Antonopoulos educates Senate of Canada about Bitcoin (Oct 8, ENG)", 
This video is an extremely informed, sober discussion of Bitcoin technology and the issues of regulation. It is long (&gt;90 mins) and is primarily a frank Q&amp;A. I believe within minutes you will see that this is well worth your time if you would like to understand the impact of the proposed regulation. 
Sirs, in my opinion and that of others, the current framework threatens the privacy of virtual currency users, innovators, and researchers and will stifle innovation, harming the State of New York and its citizens in particular.
In my opinion:
1.	The BitLicense far too broad, requiring licenses for far more than just money services. This first and foremost represents regulatory overreach. 
2.	It infringes on the privacy rights of individual users. Companies that obtain a BitLicense could be forced to collect identifying data on account holders and end users including full name and physical address. This information will be kept on file for 10 years in case the government seeks it. So while individual users may not need a BitLicense, their privacy will be seriously affected. History has proven that when personal information is aggregated in a database, it becomes an easy target.
3.	It forces virtual currency innovators to undergo rigorous background checks and submit fingerprints to state and federal law enforcement. This will create a barrier to entry for start ups and inventors looking to create new services. For example it could even prevent educators from offering classes on cryptocurrency theory and practice by requiring any student who touches related software code to undergo such onerous procedures or risk committing a violation of law. 
4.	The proposal as written raises clear and substantial First Amendment concerns.
It’s premature to craft regulations for an industry that’s so new and still in flux. Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies are still in their infancy, and we are already seeing technological solutions that would render certain regulations obsolete. Clearly it is far more desirable to allow technology instead of government to solve problems where possible. This regulatory proposal could cut that innovation off at the knees, before we have a chance to see the potential societal benefits.
NY DFS should respect the privacy of technology users, and limit its regulation to what is proportionate to the real threat at hand, and must target only those who might seek to abuse the technology rather than treating all who use it as suspect.

Disagree. Instead I would say people have less incentive to spend money wastefully. When money loses value every day, you'll just throw it away. *See: ghost cities.*


Disagree, as follows:
If there is a finite amount of money in circulation, and the economy is held exactly constant, then the money is worth exactly the same, year over year.
The value of the money only grows because the economy grows. When the economy grows, it needs more money in circulation, but there is only a finite amount, so each bit of money is worth more. If the money is worth more people are less likely to spend as you point out. However this acts as a useful counteracting force against the economy's expansion.
But the money is only worth more because the economy grew, and the economy only grows because money is invested in it. What happens when, as you say, people hoard their deflationary money?
Well the economy slows down. There is less demand for money. Money becomes worth less. And people are more inclined to spend it.
It's a natural countercyclical system.
This rebuts your other points as well.


Because all they know, and all they control, is tied up in the existing debt based money system.

For a first world person with a credit/debit card doing normal first world things without much concern for privacy, I agree with you.
Note that even in America, there are 100 million people without credit or debit cards or bank accounts. Some of them purchase prepaid debit cards (at a cost) for those times when payment by card is needed, otherwise they just use cash.
And that's just America. Have you ever been to Italy? Cash and privacy are still king in many places.
So there are a lot of people even in the first world who could benefit.

If only this were true. Sadly, lawmakers can use any language they like when creating legislation. For the irs it's an asset. For FinCen it's a currency. If the Department of Education wanted to claim it is a textbook they can.

That stat is mislabeled, as there is obviously no such cost.  Whoever labeled that number clearly doesn't understand basic accounting.
The block reward shouldn't be expressed as transaction cost but instead as inflation, which doesn't affect transactors but rather savers.
Proof: If you buy 1 Bitcoin to spend it immediately then you experience zero inflation and therefore incur zero of this "cost" even though you have transacted twice.
The More You Know 
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:24:31




The difficulty to mine blocks is floating such that the sum total of hashpower on the network will always produce a block roughly every 10 mins. If there is excess capacity such that some miners become unprofitable, those miners will drop out. 
It is impossible to predict the future profitability of mining as it is quite dependent on the price of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin keeps enough value, mining can stay profitable for a long time. But it will always go through business cycles. 


This occurs when two blocks (A, B) happen to be mined more or less at the same time. Some clients proceed to build the blockchain using block A, others with block B. The losing block is called an orphan.  Transactions in the orphaned block not present in the winning block are rolled back to the clients and resubmitted to the network. 


The process is simply a race. A transaction is forwarded onto the network where it is rebroadcast and picked up by miners to include in the next block. The first miner to solve for the next block wins the reward and broadcasts the block and its transactions to many other nodes, which include it and forward it to signal miners to start solving the next block. 


Yes. The winning miner wins the entire block reward (currently 25 btc not 50 - the reward halves periodically) plus all transaction fees included in the block. Note that transaction fees are dwarfed by the size of the block reward and will not become a substantial source of revenue for miners until after several more halvings and / or some breakthrough in throughput that allows for including many many more transactions per block. 
Note that when miners mine in a pool, as is almost always the case, the reward is split among pool participants according to their mining agreement. 


It has happened in some of the less free places in the world. And most of the rest of the world will probably seek to impose some kind of regulation on it. But it's hard to craft tight regulation or outright bans around Bitcoin in free countries because ultimately it's individuals trading a harmless commodity - Bitcoin isn't a drug or a gun or a slave. In the USA for example there is a legal tradition of money as speech. And major companies like Overstock, Dell, and Paypal are already on board.

If he bothered to apologize for replying rudely to a reasonable question then maybe I'd have a different opinion. But the quality of this sub suffers for the trolling and we have a right to fight back.)
I will interact with any participant on this sub as an adult until they prove themselves otherwise. This guy has already proven himself a troll to plenty of people here including me. So I'm done taking him seriously.
Any review of my post history will reveal that I'm more than happy to politely debate with people with whom I disagree. Ask flibbrMarketplace, he and I disagree on many topics but there's no trolling. Even when we annoy each other.
Thing us, once you determine someone is here to troll, it's important to stop interacting with them seriously, as their only intent is to troll you, not to have a serious discussion. This is why we say "don't feed the trolls." Either ignore them or call them out, but don't get suckered into a conversation with them because they aren't interested in anything but annoying you.

No, I pay 1% at ATMs (in Italy, Holland, Denmark, France, and the other EU countries I visit).  $12 is the cost to withdraw $1200.  And the exchange rate is almost always superior at ATMs (it's the interbank rate).  In my experience you *always* get the worst rates at airports by far.
In the states I bank at a regional bank that doesn't have partners overseas but which offers a very good ATM situation.

I understand what you mean by this, but I want to note that Bitcoin is a payment infrastructure that is agnostic to its use.
It's true: you can be a bank of one. You can just as easily be a bank of one million.
If some new form of banking, or even conventional banking, can utilize Bitcoin as a payment rail (and they can), more power to them.

OP apparently bought 1/2 BTC on the expectation that in a matter of months it would increase significantly in value, which indicates gambling-like behavior. Since Bitcoin hasn't appreciated in those few months OP is now thinking about taking the loss, which indicates an almost childish impatience and/or financial insolvency.

Why, if the *value* of the coin is lower (you said this) would anyone be willing to offer the same price as before? This would be making a losing purchase according to your own value judgements.

Bitcoin is an entire financial system.
It is a currency, in the sense that you can spend it like any other money with retailers. You can also exchange it for other currency like dollars or euros. Unlike dollars or euros, Bitcoin is truly international.
It is also a value storage system, like a savings account or a lockbox, because you control the Bitcoin you own, and because the network is designed in a manner that should protect the wealth you store in Bitcoin through scarcity and appreciation in value.
It is also a payment processing system, because when you transact Bitcoin, your transactions are handled automatically by the Bitcoin network, which covers the cost of your transaction.
Lastly Bitcoin is also an open, worldwide accounting system that is the system of record for all transactions on the network. 
So Bitcoin is much more than "internet money." In many ways it's an entire financial system.

You're almost there:


Hmmm. And these bond assets, where did they come from? They are simply notes that promise to pay back with interest, no? They weren't assets that were sitting around, they are just liabilities that were invented out of thin air.


**Most people think "money" is created on printing presses. Most people are wrong.**
From Wikipedia:


Any loan that is not backed 100% by a hard asset creates money. FRB creates money through the multiplier effect. T-bills create money directly. They are only backed by a promise to pay the buyer back with interest. Since the creditor (the US government) clearly has far more liabilities than assets, all T-bills are exactly equivalent to freshly printed cash.
If you still don't think the US created trillions of dollars in 2008 then please explain this graph. Who, exactly created it?
You can see the rapid fall of m3 as CDOs and other bogus assets started vanishing out of thin air as banks started writing of their losses by the trillions. It is matched shortly thereafter by a sudden spike in M1 as the government and the Fed worked to pour new money into the system in the form of stimulus spending (again, the government creates money any time it spends money it doesn't have) and TARP and other bailout loans.
In short:
**The US government does not have the power to print bills. But it absolutely can and does create money all the time.**

I'll just repost this here:
Everyone keeps saying, "blockchain technology is great, but it doesn't need Bitcoin."  It's like a mantra.  Blockchain = good, Bitcoin = irrelevant.
There is also this idea that blockchains can be repurposed and used independent of Bitcoin by centralized entities like banks and governments.
These people don't understand how blockchains work.
To the first point: a blockchain is secured by miners who compete with each other to profit from building the blockchain.  Without a valuable coin, miners will not build a valuable infrastructure to mine it.  Without a valuable mining infrastructure, the decentralized mining network is trivial to attack by a wealthy attacker.
This is the primary issue with alts: not that they embody bad ideas, but rather that the value proposition of (1) a highly competitive mining network, (2) mining a comparatively valuable coin with (3) relatively high capitalization *dwarfs* the value proposition of any new "altcoin ideas."
This is why in my opinion Bitcoin will remain the dominant blockchain / cryptocurrency until new technology is discovered that literally renders blockchains irrelevant.  New technologies will be layered on top of the existing protocol which will evolve slowly and purposefully.  *See: Linux kernel; TCP/IP, SMTP, HTTP protocols.*
**TL;DR: the security of a blockchain is directly proportional to the value of its coin, and bootstrapping the value proposition of a decentralized coin is really, really hard.**
This immediately invokes the second point that needs refuting: that centralized operators like banks or governments could make a coin and control it by owning the mining network.  The theory is that they would operate miners inside a "closed" network, and distribute the mined coins however they prefer.   Like a "DollarCoin."  There is also the theory that businesses etc. might spin up their own coins to create "non-money" blockchains - like blockchains that just store contracts - independent of Bitcoin, the idea being that the mining network would be closed and secure within a "ring of trust."  I think both ideas are absurd.
Why is this absurd?  Because the minute you assume a centralized mining network operating within a secure "ring of trust", there's really no reason to use a blockchain at all.  Standard SQL databases and old-fashioned IT of the sort that banks already use *are actually better adapted for solving problems of centralized computing within a ring of trust.* 
Blockchains solve the problem of *decentralized* money and *decentralized* computing.  The minute you assume a "secure ring of trust" the benefit of a blockchain completely disappears, and it actually becomes a liability.
**TL;DR: Using blockchains for centralized solutions is like attaching a carburetor and mufflers to your horse to get more "horsepower".**

You are essentially describing a centralized trading system, since all players must trust the majority 51% holder not to double-spend or otherwise alter transactions, and upon whom the entire network relies for security.
If I was a centralized entity wishing to host such a system, why would I not simply use traditional relational databases that perform far better and which every developer already understands?

 Bitcoin is an inflationary money supply. ~3600 are created daily.  That means in order to hold its price, more than $1.5M must move into the market every day. If only $1M of new money comes in, the price drops. 
Also a lot of people went long on margin expecting a bubble by now and some of them got margin calls and dumped the coins. 
Also there was a market manipulation attempt that flash crashed the price on bitfinex which rippled across the market. The crash on bitfinex is not surprising since that's where a lot of the margin speculators are. 
Typical day in Bitcoin. Nothing to see here. Please move along.

I misunderstood your explanation. You mean that they will quit working on the  "real" blockchain while they are constructing the fake one.
I'm curious about the network impact of the attacker forking the blockchain like this. A minority of nodes still have the honest blockchain. In an attack situation like this, wouldn't the attacker run a tremendous risk of a code fork that renders their dishonest blockchain and their entire operation useless?

It presumes you have already been rightly charged with an underlying crime.  By definition, the only money that can be laundered is illegally-gained money.  You cannot be rightly accused of laundering legally-gained money, just like you can't be rightly accused of "tampering with evidence" until there exists some crime to be under investigation.
When you launder stolen money (or, the case that the feds *really* care about, when you operate a business to help people launder stolen money) you likewise cause public harm: you exacerbate the cost of investigation and make it virtually impossible to return the stolen property to its rightful owner.
Again - since people seem to keep forgetting the point - using a mixing service to obfuscate legally-obtained Bitcoin is *NOT* money-laundering and therefore outside the scope of this thread.   Any attempts by law enforcement to prevent people from mixing legally-obtained Bitcoin is a misuse of the law and a violation of various rights and other laws.

Good post.
This sub like most of English speaking reddit is myopically middle class American. If it isn't useful for 20-something Americans, it has no future. 
ApplePay isn't actually a competitor to Bitcoin in most of the best use cases for Bitcoin.
It does nothing to offer a remittances solution, as it is USA only. It does nothing to help the unbanked. It cannot be used as a value store. ~~It is centralized and if hacked will be a disaster.~~ 
If you think that Bitcoin was ever going to succeed by going straight for the "broad middle" of the payments industry in the USA, Apple looks like a threat, because that's where Apple will possibly succeed. 
If instead, like me, you think that Bitcoin will keep eating away at edge cases until it finally achieves market significance or dominance, then Apple is good news: they won't address edge cases well, they'll convince people it's finally time to ditch plastic cards in favor of smartphones, and they'll convince merchants to have good mobile payments infrastructure Bitcoin can leverage.

So think of it this way.
One group of people see Bitcoin as a kind of inevitability. They're the true believers. They own miners or have purchased Bitcoin in speculation that it will be widely adopted and thus their speculation will be richly rewarded. Most of these people have been richly rewarded so far and have lots of disposable Bitcoin which, at over $800 even after the "crash" are still worth a fortune right now if you're sitting on hundreds or thousands. Obviously that's a good market for retailers to target especially if it isn't too costly or time consuming to bolt on a payment processor, and obviously if you're sitting on a pile of Bitcoin and want a new raid array or Mercedes, why not just buy with Bitcoin, especially if there's some kind of discount (see below)?
Now there's the second group, the "non true believers" who don't want to hold Bitcoin, or those who would hold Bitcoin but who can't afford to risk money holding it. You're asking about these people: "why spend USD to buy Bitcoin just so that I can use them to buy something else?" It's a good question. Here are some reasons:
*Some sellers are offering discounts for purchases in Bitcoin. Maybe they're worth it to you.*
You had mentioned USD. That's about the only reason I can come up with why someone who holds USD (the world's reserve currency) and who banks in the USA and who is shopping in the USA would bother.  If this is your question, I agree, it may not be worth it, but it depends on the discount I suppose.
*Maybe you don't have USD but rather some other currency, or maybe you're purchasing from outside of the USA, so that currency exchange friction comes into play.*
Bitcoin can help in many of those cases.
*Maybe you don't have a US bank account and can't get a credit card.*
Generally speaking, most people in the world have better access to internet than good banking, even in the USA. We're talking about something like a billion people, including tens of millions in the USA. For many of these people, Bitcoin is starting to become a way to self-bank.
I'm sure that's not an exhaustive list but I think it opens the door on the wider discussion of "why would someone use Bitcoin to make a purchase?"

Good reply.
I too have spent decades in IT, and I'm well aware of scalability problems.... And accountability problems, too: it was well known that Mark hired only a handful of contractors and provided almost no oversight. I've learned a lot of lessons the hard way as well, so I say all this with some humility. 
If you study Mark's history a little, it's pretty obvious that he was a hack who got in way over his head. His tech skills are weak. "Idiot" may be a pejorative term, but he was in over his head in IT, and now he's in over his head with the law.
You'll recall Mark said the coins weren't stolen but rather "lost." This takes on a much more sinister tone in light of the evidence of this bot. How did he "know" they weren't stolen, now that it has been shown that they were in fact *stolen from the inside?*

By the way I agree that sooner or later the mining arms race will end in a fiery crash. 
However your post is unhelpful. The best mid term projection for minimum price levels expected would look similar to the exponentially increasing price floors dictated by past crashes. posts these daily.
Assuming the price will stay current or drop significantly over the next 6-12 months would be to assume a break from the multi-year price growth. It's definitely possible but you would need to present a compelling argument as to why.

Why do you care about it on a per transaction basis? It's a useless metric. 
Since the cost is basically fixed at any point in time, all you're doing is re-reporting the total number of transactions per block under a different label thinking it's telling you something different. It isn't. It's the same measure.
Edit: 
As currently measured 
Cost per TX = (BR + F) / TX
Where BR is the fixed 25 btc reward, F are variable transaction fees, and TX is the number of transactions.
F is *far* smaller than BR. With 500 transactions per block, at 0.0001 btc per transaction, it's still noise. So mostly, this formula is reporting 
BR / TX
But BR is fixed at 25.
Why do you care about the number 25 divided by the number of transactions per block? You should just measure the number of transactions per block. It's telling you the same thing exactly and it's a lot clearer than dividing the number 25 by it. 
Metrics should be actionable. This tells us nothing. As I said elsewhere, it's like measuring car registration fees per mile driven: it does you no good - and will hurt you if you try to improve it, because the only way to lower your costs per mile are just to drive extra miles for no reason. 
If we want to report per-transaction costs, report just the fees, exclusive of the block reward:
F / TX 
Would actually be telling you something rather than just restating the number of transactions per block. 
If you want to measure the impact of the block reward, measure it as a money supply inflation rate, because that's what it is. It is only paid by savers. If you buy bitcoin to spend immediately, you are not subject to inflation, and therefore incur none of the costs of the miner reward. 
**TL;DR measure things that vary per transaction on a per transaction basis. Measure fixed costs differently because they are not borne on a per transaction basis.**

Your example speaks to the inefficiency of the banking industry not the technology being used.
Banking as an industry is horribly slow to adopt tech. For Pete's sake they still use ACH. In 2006 I did a project with ACH and Bank of America was still using insecure FTP to move the files around. It's pitiful.

Just in case this affects your valuation.
@_date: 2014-09-08 07:43:47


I precisely explained the effect I indended to discuss in my example which you derisively wrote off.
The first real world Bitcoin transaction occurred when a pizza was sold in 2010 for 10,000 btc. Given a supply of roughly 2M BTC at the time, that means that fully *1/2% of the entire monetary base of Bitcoin* had to be acquired and exchanged in order to move one pizza's worth of value through the economy. Realistically, there was not enough "liquidity" in the entire economy to even facilitate pizza transfers as there were only 200 pizzas worth of value in the entire economy (I'm using the word "liquidity" because you won't tell me your preferred term for the phenomenon I wish to discuss). And please don't deride my example as absurd, since it is in fact a real world example. 
Today there is enough "liquidity" to facilitate pizza transfers, primarily because investors have moved value into the economy. But there is not yet enough "liquidity" to facilitate remittance, as moving that amount of value through the economy would definitely affect the price of the currency. We need more investors to move more value into the economy, raising the "liquidity" so that large movements of value will not disrupt the price.  When that happens, Bitcoins utility (problem solving ability) will be even higher. 
That is my point.
Please realize that IME there are different meanings for the word liquidity.  I can talk about the liquidity of a given exchange, which refers to the depth of order books and velocity of transfers which IMO is more or less your definition.  I can talk about the liquidity of a business, which is the ability of that business to raise ready cash relative to its other illiquid assets. And there's the liquidity of an entire economy, which is the relative ability of that economy to facilitate transfers without moving the price of the currency. This involves all markets for the currency, including all points of exchange in the economy from local brokers to worldwide exchanges to pizza salesmen who trade pizza for currency. Anyone who trades an item of value (USD, EURO, pizzas, cars) for the currency increases its "liquidity" (ability to transfer value without moving the price) by adding value to it. 
The last definition is the one I'm using, and I'll be happy to stop using it the instant you give me a more appropriate word.

You clearly understand economics. In economics we use the Latin term ceteris paribus which means "all other things equal."
This thread is full of people dying to argue that Bitcoin isn't inflationary. I beg to differ. Not only is the money supply increasing at a decent clip, but ceteris paribus purchasing power is also decreasing.
One need only watch the price of Bitcoin pre and post Willy to see the effect that mining has on price (and to see the effect of removing a roughly equivalent amount from the money supply, which is what the Willy bot stole daily).
Bitcoin is inflating.

You don't get it, tulip. The higher Bitcoin price is, the *better* it works for transactions like remittances, and the more likely people are to use it vis-à-vis another crypto.
With a high valuation, large amounts can move through the network without moving price. If Bitcoin is $100k/coin I can send $10M with only 100 coins. If Bitcoin is $1 I have to buy 10M Bitcoin to send $10M, or roughly the entire supply of coins available.

As I said, we disagree philosophically on many things.  But you're obviously polite and not trolling, so I'll reply in kind.
I will agree with you that FRB (because that's the system we're talking about) cannot exist without a central currency and a lender of last resort.  That has been demonstrated again and again.
I would argue that is not because it is impossible to have a decentralized banking system, but rather because the FRB system is inherently based on fraud and is therefore doomed to fail frequently on a micro scale or infrequently on a macro scale.
It began like this: you give me gold to hold, and I hand you a paper note that is redeemable for your gold.  Historically, this created the advent of paper currency, which was a giant step forward for the economies of all nations because it eliminated much of the friction of transacting in gold, and created an inflationary cycle through the money multiplier effect.  Paper money is useful and inflation is stimulative, so we conclude incorrectly that we have an economically efficient solution where nobody is worse off and everyone is better off.
However the system is fundamentally unsound because it is based on a lie: those notes, which everyone assumed were worth their face value, were not.  Bank runs will always be common in an FRB system without a central lender of last resort.
But who is the lender of last resort?  Who pays when banks fail?  As we have seen, when banks fail, the lender of last resort is, as always, *the taxpayer.*
In my view, decentralized FRB was prone to lots of small banking runs and lots of rashes of failures.  In contrast, centralized FRB is subject to very few but extremely profound crashes.
In my view, the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 was simply a failure of FRB because like FRB it was based on selling securities that are supposed to be backed by assets which were not actually present, and when it came time to redeem the securities, the assets were not available.  CDOs backed by subprime mortgages are really no different than an IOU for gold that isn't actually at the goldsmith or bank.  It's just fraud.
In my view, the first bank to accept a deposit of gold in exchange for an IOU and then re-loan that gold to a third party should have been charged with fraud.  And, indeed, there are billions of people in the world who agree with me.
Was/is FRB a good thing for the world?  Depends on how you look at it.  In the short run, inflation stimulates the economy, making it appear more healthy than other economies that are not inflating their currencies.  Likewise, in the short run, a little bump of methamphetamine stimulates the central nervous system, making one appear more intelligent and productive than other people who are not stimulating their central nervous systems.  Almost anyone can take a little methamphetamine and perform better for a little while.
However in the long run, dependence on stimulus to maintain performance is unsustainable.  In my view, we are seeing that playing out now in the USA.  Only time will tell.
You will argue that FRB produced economic superiority for Western nations and I cannot argue against that.  It created a lower-friction economy and spurred inflation, both of which stimulated growth.  However I don't see how you can argue that it is sustainable. The Federal Reserve has offered zero-interest money now for seven years or so and it is not stimulative.  Like a meth addict at the end of their run, the drug no longer stimulates, it just sustains, and eventually it will quit doing that as well.
Meanwhile the entire system makes the cost of saving money very high. The entire "stimulus based" economy abhors consumers who save instead of spend, and makes no difference whether they spend their money on something productive and durable or on services and consumables, just so long as they don't hold their money.  In fact, consumers are encouraged to regularly spend more than they have.
The logical conclusion of this system is one in which all players (individuals and corporations) hold debt because holding money is too costly.  And indeed, this has been the natural progression.  It is hard to see how an economy in which all players are indebted (ultimately to the Federal system) is sustainable.  It is incredibly fragile.  The subprime crisis fortunately came at a moment in which the economy was running fairly hot.  If we sustained another such crisis now, it's impossible for me to see how we could possibly correct it.  The Federal Reserve would literally have to pay people to take money, since it already is offering it for free.
OK, that's enough.  I'm quite sure that you have a lengthy rebuttal to all my points and I could probably draft your rebuttal for you.  I'm quite familiar of the ways in which my explanation violates many tenets of modern economic theory (I have the better part of a degree in economics).  I just disagree with some of what I've been taught.  Or rather, I find it incomplete.
Peace and good luck.
TL;DR: You claim "free banking" failed because it was decentralized.  I claim that it failed because it's based on fraud.  I can't argue against you: I agree that FRB without a lender of last resort is doomed.  However I don't believe you can argue against me: no bank will ever fail that holds 100% of its deposits.  No FRB, no bank runs.  QED.  I furthermore argue that my system is superior because it is based on truth, not fraud, and that truth in values is required for a healthy economy.

Known issue with known solutions (pruning / rollups) that isn't being addressed right now since it is not a current problem.


This is an absurd red herring that needs to die in a fire.  Bitcoin confirms in minutes the same transaction that takes anywhere from days to months in the Visa world (depending on your accounting methods).  For most transactions especially small-value  POS sales no confirmations are needed, just as they are not needed in the Visa universe.


This should not be a feature of the coin but rather layered onto it through another abstraction.  Frankly, as long as we use networks that are not anonymous, the idea of assets on that network staying anonymous is pretty absurd.  When we have truly anonymous networking, then we can have truly anonymous money on it.


You just refuted your previous point.  A coin cannot at the same time be insufficiently anonymous and too anonymous.  Which is it? 


See  - Bitcoin is a push payment like cash, so like cash, needs a layered service that can provide customer protection.  Customer protection should not be a feature of the money but a service that is operated when protection is needed.  For most transactions, including all POS and reputation-based transactions, this is not an issue, just as it isn't with cash.


All cryptocurrency is dodgy, because all cryptocurrency depends on math that none of its users are truly qualified to vet.  Therefore, the least dodgy is the one that currently protects the greatest wealth.  That is Bitcoin.


Feature, not bug.  A deflationary currency is the long-run Nash equilibrium as people will always prefer to receive money that is more likely to appreciate than depreciate.
**TL;DR: Blockchain bloat is an issue but not a current problem, the rest of your points are either not problems at all, or are problems best solved outside of the currency specification.**

Man, I'm the opposite of a person who blindly follows each and every law.  Sometimes to a glaring fault.  But you replied politely so I'll reply in kind.
I'm not here to defend any particular flavor of "anti-money-laundering" law.  I'm not here to defend the statutes as-written.  You will not find that I have done so.
I'm simply here to argue two things:
There exist actual criminals who commit actual crimes which actually harm people;
that when these people launder their illegally-gained money, there is a societal cost (it interferes with investigation) plus additional harm caused to the immediate victim of the crime (makes it impossible to return the property to the victim); 
that this at the minimum makes it immoral to knowingly help someone launder their illegally-gained money; 
that the immorality of at least certain acts of "money laundering" may morally justify at least some laws aimed to punish those who would commit at least this sort of "money laundering" (ie people who would build a business specifically to help criminals conduct illegal operations); 
and finally that this means *we should stop talking about "money laundering" as though it is perforce harmless behavior, when it is patently obvious that at least some forms of money laundering are reprehensible* but instead talk specifically and with nuance about the specific statutes or examples of misuse of statutes with which we take issue.
Since money laundering is, by definition, obfuscation of illegally-obtained money, it is definitionally impossible to be laundering your legal money, and thus mixing, buying Bitcoin, etc. should all NOT BE CONSIDERED OR CALLED MONEY LAUNDERING.

If everyone (edit: at MIT) has Bitcoin there is much more likely to be a network effect where some people start using it as primary currency.
@_date: 2014-09-08 08:57:55
Depends. 
For example. Do you think the best use cases for Bitcoin are currently in the USA? I don't. And Apple's announcement, whatever it is, will not initially be a global payments system, as they have poor overall market penetration outside the USA. So I don't really see it as a true competitor. 
It will also not compete with Bitcoin in other ways. 
For example I suspect it will offer little to nothing in the way of a remittances solution. As it will almost certainly require the Apple account be tied to a bank or credit account, it won't do anything to help the unbanked. Etc.
If you think that Bitcoin was ever going to succeed by going straight for the "broad middle" of the payments industry in the USA, Apple looks like a threat, because that's where Apple will go. 
 If instead, like me, you think that Bitcoin will keep eating away at edge cases until it finally achieves market significance, then Apple is good news: they won't address edge cases well, they'll convince people it's finally time to ditch plastic cards in favor of smartphones, and they'll convince merchants to have good mobile payments infrastructure Bitcoin can leverage.

interesting point - I mean, they could do it maybe once or twice again before the  market saw the writing on the wall and price short-circuited to zero.
What's interesting about this to me is that it implies that if someone wanted to try a *for-profit* "51%+shorting assault" on Bitcoin, at best they might profit *significantly* only once or maybe twice before the coin never recovered.

When Bitcoin starts catching on in Italy....
As a function of (GDP * % of economy running in the black market) Italy is king. An economy bigger than India and &gt; 25% of it is off the books. And widespread adoption of internet and smartphones.
You hook Italians up with a Mycelium wallet and some Bitcoin and they will start doing business in it before you can say "Satoshi".
I've been watching this since I first put 2+2 together (Italy being a potential ground zero for mass Bitcoin adoption). I think Italy could become the major government first disrupted by Bitcoin.
People think of Italy as backwater and slow to change (and it certainly can be that) but Italians are also rabid inventors and tech innovators (ie Arduino) and will adopt a technology quickly if it saves them a buck (ie WhatsApp which blew up big in Italy due to savings in SMS costs).
Banking in Italy sucks and like most things Italian is mired in red tape and scandal. Also lot of Italians are quite anarchist / anti-state so Bitcoin also fits well with the value system.
Italians also hate being on the euro but also don't trust their own state with currency. So Bitcoin has a very strong message there as well.
In short: alla luna!

Why are you cynical?
The rules are currently drafted intentionally restrictive in order to surface friction points.
No way does Lawsky want to regulate every Bitcoin startup particularly those not based in his jurisdiction. His job is to establish a "legacy complaint" Bitcoin trading ecosystem in his own jurisdiction.
He no more has control over your startup than he does over the DAX or TSE even though New Yorkers trade on those exchanges.
Consider the collapse of the state sales tax system on internet purchase. This is the same. They will be able to enforce tight regulations where they are desirable - Wall Street - in order to create exchanges and products that system is comfortable with. Don't want to trade there? Trade outside the jurisdiction.
Ultimately these exchanges and products will have to compete in a free market for Bitcoin on other exchanges like Bitstamp and we'll let the market decide if the extra regulations add value or just friction.

Talk about a ponzi scheme.
The "units of value" represent claims against the value of the business. As if these businesses aren't already horribly overvalued. Surely twitter will follow soon after, and WhatsApp...
There will be no strong regulatory framework and these businesses will game the political system to keep it that way. In the meantime they'll weaken the traditional banking system.
If the currency is "backed" by Facebook corporate value, how is the value reclaimed in the event of a run on the "bank?" When Facebank (or twitterbank etc) goes bust, who gets to claim their share first, stockholders or users of the "currency?" Definitely *not* the people with the currency. The first run on one these services will cause a run on the whole system.

**This is a weak buttcoin lie that needs to die in a fire**
The current, typical, actual cost of a Bitcoin transaction is about $0.05.
This invented "transaction cost" you're referring to is expressed as monetary inflation. It is not incurred at transaction time. It is borne by long term holders of the coin not by transactors.
If you buy Bitcoin to remit and cash out immediately in a foreign country, or to buy something on the Internet, you conduct two Bitcoin transactions (one where you acquire the Bitcoin, one where you spend them) yet you pay **zero** of this imaginary "transaction cost", as you do not hold the coin long enough to feel any inflationary impact whatsoever.
trolls are the only people in the world who think that monetary inflation should be treated as a per-transaction cost.
And they think this only applies to Bitcoin, as they would never, ever, *ever* calculate the inflation of the US dollar and tack it on to a transaction and call it a "fee".

Good post, but...
I'm late 40s and y'all are all wrong. Internet began in early 1970s, email followed shortly thereafter, Usenet was around by the early 1980s, but hardly anyone could explain what the internet was in 1995. Twenty five years in and it was just getting past the "nerds only" phase. It took the invention of the http protocol to really get things going and even that took another decade before it left the early adoption phase.
I rolled out one of the first websites for a Fortune 100 semiconductor company (ie highly technically savvy) in 1997 and rolled out the first email system for another Fortune 100 company in 2000, *thirty years after the invention of email.*

As you point out, at a billion users, the revolution has already taken place.
My point was exaggerated however. But let's look at facts.
Bitcoin is already being held. Currently by geeks and speculators, but it is already being held, and held by more people every day.
Bitcoin is already being used as currency. Currently by geeks and entrepreneurs, but it is already being used, and is being used by more people every day.
So there already exists a admittedly very tiny but ever-growing base of people who hold it and who use it as currency.
The question then becomes, how much adoption will it take before even one tiny community of people (community in the broad sense, not just geographic) starts using it in a more or less closed system? It doesn't have to be fiat-free, just crypto-dominant. Because at that point I think we will be coming close to a tipping point of adoption: once a sufficient number of people adopt it that an entire economy starts to emerge, the question of success is answered.

We've had this discussion before :) while you're correct that the fed has no obligation to print free money and give it to the government (as it is now doing) it also has no history of refusing, either.
But what if it does as you say? Let's suppose the fed refuses to continue to create and loan money to the federal government at zero percent interest. If that happens, the government can either raise the revenue through increased taxation on your children (enslavement) or it can default on its debt obligation (crashing the economy). Either way your kids will be fucked.


We've had this discussion before :)
Maybe an inflation rate of 1-3% is a good thing due to stickiness factors as asserted by a consensus of economists. But we aren't talking about that. We're talking about serious, painful inflation.


I would argue that Japan is in a bubble. Would you loan money to a country whose GDP was 1/2 it's debt burden? Why? I wouldn't. Either they'll be unable to repay, or they'll repay in money worth a fraction of what was lent.
But you're right: For some reason it's still happening, I guess because people still think the Japanese are special super-human people that can solve any problem. We'll see. I'd bet against them.
I do know that Italy, Ireland, Spain, etc. reached the wall of "debt&gt;GDP" and hit that wall pretty hard. When Japan hits it, the whole world will feel it.
We'll agree to disagree again, I suppose. Nice chatting with you.

They're just being American. Americans think the whole world speaks English and accepts dollars.
This is why Americans are in a bad position to grasp the importance of Bitcoin: most of them have never had to transact in any currency other than dollars or deal with foreign banks and are unaware of the extreme money and banking friction that exist throughout the world including many developed countries.
In America even kids without a job can get a "credit" card and a "free" checking account so they don't really see a benefit in Bitcoin.

EDIT: I feel the need to leave this here since people are coming in from other subs and failing to read what I'm writing.
TL;DR: "Money laundering" (like "tampering with evidence") *requires first that an underlying crime be committed.*  If you are mixing legally-gained Bitcoin, then by definition this is NOT "money laundering" and falls outside the scope of this discussion.
Also TL;DR: of course there are bad actors in law enforcement that apply this crime unfairly.  There are people that get wrongly charged with murder, too.  That doesn't invalidate murder as a crime.  I'm completely against the misuse of the charge of "money laundering" nor do I support the existing AML/KYC laws as they are currently being applied to Bitcoin.
That said:






No, it is in no way similar. If you commit a crime and launder the money you receive in the commission of the crime, you actually harm me and all other law abiding taxpayers.




I'm not talking about being accused of laundering money when you aren't actually laundering money. I'm talking about *actually laundering money.*


Anyone can be accused of anything. I can accuse you right now of baby rape.  But *actual money laundering* is by definition *an attempt to cover up an actual crime*.


None of which is actually money laundering and therefore off topic.


Then why don't you say "using a mixing service harms no one" if that's what you mean. Using a mixing service is not money laundering. You seem to be confusing two totally different terms.

Even among the well educated, most people believe that inflation isn't bad, but good, because in college economics we are taught it is in fact *necessary.*

That's just the USA. Go to Europe where banking is harder and internet is cheaper (source: live part time in Italy) and the numbers are even more dramatic. And Italy invented banking.
And that's just the first world. Go to the third world and banking is only for the rich. But internet is becoming widely available.
To me it's obvious that for hundreds of millions of people in first world countries, Bitcoin represents a huge step forward in money savings and transmission that current systems simply do not provide.

~3600 bitcoin are created every day in the form of 25 btc block rewards every 10 mins.
That is textbook, Econ 101 money supply inflation.
THAT'S what's being measured per transaction by the current metric.  It's stupid to call it a per-transaction cost because it's actually not paid per transaction.  In fact, if you buy Bitcoin and use it to purchase something immediately, you've paid ZERO of those "costs" as inflation since you didn't hold the coin long enough to be affected.
Inflation doesn't affect people who transact more.  It affects those who save or hold.  So reporting it as a transaction cost is not informational, but actually deeply misleading.

For one thing can we stop calling ourselves hoarders and call ourselves savers instead? Because that's what I'm doing: saving.
Secondly, here's why savers are good for Bitcoin: they raise the exchange rate when they buy and hold. But why is this good?
A favorable exchange rate, or high Bitcoin price, means the currency is more liquid. A more liquid currency can support larger and larger transactions.
Suppose Bitcoin is worth $1 and I want to send the equivalent of $1M through Bitcoin. I need a million Bitcoin. That's almost 1/10th of the entire money supply in one transaction.
Conversely, if Bitcoin is worth $1M, then I need only move one coin to exchange the same value. The network could easily support many such transactions with a stable exchange rate. The best part is that a favorable exchange rate (high Bitcoin price) helps all members of the Bitcoin ecosystem, from kids buying pizza on up. Literally, more expensive money is "better money."
When looked at this way, you realize that people buying and holding the currency are helping the network just like people who buy a miner or run a full node.
TL;DR when Bitcoin is worth more, it literally becomes more powerful. Holders make everyone better off.

Have you ever mined?
The 3600 BTC created by mining daily is not distributed to one entity. It is distributed to thousands of miners. A small number of big pools make a small daily profit and those pools are under contract to sell newly mined coins to exchanges like Coinbase (nothing like 3600/day however). But the majority of the BTC mined every day is scattered to thousands of individuals.
Most of them sell on exchanges immediately.

This would be good.

Three things. 
.1. You say the economic disincentive to a 51% attack is insignificant and hold up Ghash.io as an example. What proof have you that Ghash.io attempted even one double spend? Double spend attempts are detectable on the network. How long can a pool profitably double spend and continue to hold a majority stake in mining? My guess is under a day, then they would pay a *very* heavy price indeed. 
I continue to be unswayed by arguments that greedy but network-supporting pools (those who would seek to abuse 51% by double spending) would ever risk it, and continue to believe the real threat is and always will be the NETWORK-HOSTILE entities (those who would abuse 51% by attempting to damage / destroy the network). As a result I think we must always consider this POV first and foremost: what makes it hardest for a *hostile* attacker?
.2. That said you have a lot of good ideas to discuss and I hope the community will engage this discussion. 
.3. That said your attempts to market your company, well intentioned though they may be, in my opinion really take away from the discussion. 
If I may make a suggestion. It is my experience with this sub that if you participate in discussion without promoting yourself you will gain a stronger reputation in the community. You have a lot to offer and the community will recognize your contribution. Then, when your company has something to promote, you can promote it in good faith, bringing your strong reputation to bear on the promotion. People here are typically very receptive when community leaders have a product offering to pitch.
TLDR By blending your promotion into your discussions I think you dilute both. 
Hope this helps.

HAHAHAHAHA!!!  You lack both imagination and experience.  Almost no option out of the set of likely possible options could be better.  "We won't tax Bitcoin" is not a likely option.  "We will tax it like currency" is likely, but that would be worse than taxing it like property.
I think it's safe to stop with the histrionics.
I don't believe the IRS expects you to report capital gains when you make "simple purchases."   Nobody's going to be audited for paying for groceries with BTC and failing to report their gains.
Besides, the wallet app that you use for "simple purchases" should be able to easily calculate your tax burden.  If you want to pay taxes on all your "simple purchases" (which I would argue is perhaps technically but not practically necessary) it should be easy to bolt onto your wallet app.  I don't see it being an undue burden, frankly.

It's all just a matter of perspective. Point is Apple isn't targeting the typical Walmartian either.
There's always been money to make targeting the needs of the lower income earners in a demographic. The disadvantage is that they have less disposable income. The advantage is that there are so many more of them. 
If you can create a business model that scales efficiently, like Walmart, you can make a lot of money providing these people the services they need. In Walmarts case, more money than any of their competition.

I should have said block reward but you're missing the point. 
Yes miners earn transaction fees. Those fees are *noise* compared to the block reward and can be ignored for the purpose of my prior argument. 
But if you want to report transaction cost per transaction, report the fees minus the block reward. That would actually be a relevant metric since fees are a per transaction cost.

Let's face it.
In Italy, you have something like a million or more politicians getting free Mercedes 300s each year. Even mayors of pissant burgs drive these things. They aren't even fucking Fiats but brand new S300s and S330s.
And that's **AFTER "AUSTERITY"**
So austerity never actually happened. You can say it did and that the lack of results shows it was a bad idea, but the truth is these fatcats in Rome haven't actually endured any austerity or imposed it on the bureaucracy.
**THAT** is the problem.
And if that is the problem, then inflation is NOT the solution. The solution is ACTUAL AUSTERITY in which corruption, waste and inefficiency are *actually rooted out.*
Anyone who spends as much time in Italy as I cannot help but get emotional about this. Italy is an amazing country filled with amazing, often very refined and quite brilliant people and a beautiful, gentle culture who have managed to stay relevant for centuries. It is the very bosom of Western civilization. Its decline into corruption and second rate status is a terrible shame.

It would be somewhat profitable for the hour that exchanges were solvent / online, as an event like this would destroy all our current exchanges. Whether it would be enough to offset the cost of acquiring and holding together a majority pool is debatable. 
It's a doomsday scenario. Therefore I'm not inclined to think that someone would attempt to profit off bitcoin (long or short) by doing this. The profit motive would be found outside Bitcoin (ie. a semiconductor mfgr wanting to destroy its miner-producing competitor, or in a more dramatic case, one economy attempting to destroy a bitcoin-using rival economy).

Here's what's wrong with your thinking.
If you really think the price will go down, you should wait to buy. But why would the price go down 4x? And would you trust the price if it started falling that much?
If you believe in the fundamentals of Bitcoin, now is as good a time as any to buy.
"Don't have enough to afford" is a meaningless  statement. If you have $X to invest at $200/BTC, then you have $X to invest at $800/BTC.
If you can't afford to lose money, you should not buy any to hold. Bitcoin is a very risky investment.
If you can't afford to invest, but want to help Bitcoin succeed, buy something with Bitcoin. That way you are not holding, and therefore not subject to risk.
Edit: if you don't believe in the  fundamentals of Bitcoin, don't buy any and don't troll me.

I think "Bitcoin is not for you" is a terrible message to send to someone actively interested in participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Actually it isn't that hard. Here are a few simple options for using Bitcoin.
First off, for "spending money," treat Bitcoin like cash: never carry more than you're willing to likely lose. I keep a little BTC on my phone using Mycelium. It's a good app. Highly recommended. No need to be paranoid unless you install fishy apps or custom ROMs.
For long term storage there are a few options.
There is a device called Trezor that promises to store Bitcoin very securely. It is just now trickling out to market. Time will tell but appears to be a solid product. It makes storing Bitcoin painless.
Alternatively your second best bet security wise is to print off a paper wallet from a known, secure computer that is free of malware, ideally while disconnected from the internet.
For the most careful, it makes sense to download a version of Linux that will boot from a USB stick, and run from that during the wallet creation process. It does take some time but isn't a terribly painful process. Fortunately it is a one time process. For that reason you'd be advised to set aside a little time to do it. It's only once and it will ensure your wallet is strong. Once you have your paper wallet, store it in a safe place, like you would any other precious object like a valuable diamond.
If you follow this process you should be able to make a very secure wallet in 20 minutes to an hour or so, depending on your computer proficiency, the computer's speed, and network speeds. It's a one time process that pays dividends in peace of mind.

This guy gets it.
The point I keep trying (unsuccessfully) to make on is that we need to use very clear language when we discuss money laundering.
Are we discussing the current legal definition? Or are we discussing the dictionary definition? According to my dictionary, if the funds aren't illegal to begin with, then it can't be called money laundering. This is the point we need to be driving home.
Instead this sub is full of people arguing, for example, "money laundering is not wrong" (because they are talking about using a mixing service). Making the case that "money laundering is not wrong" is a terrible argument because it ignores the fact that there does exist criminal enterprises with the *sole function of aiding in the commission of theft.* Are we all saying that it should be legal to do that?
Instead they should be arguing "money laundering IS wrong, but using a mixing service is not money laundering."
TL;DR: 
"Money laundering" as defined in the dictionary is the act of helping someone commit a crime is immoral and, arguably, should be illegal.
**Buying Bitcoin/using a mixing service/ etc is not money laundering**  (unless the source of your funds was illegal and you're trying to obfuscate this fact.)

Thanks - I Googled around a bit and caught up.  I consider myself pretty up to date on BTC news so I'm surprised this one went under my radar.  Shame on me.
I agree and disagree with you.
Again I think we can all agree that a systematic way of guaranteeing decentralization (like a systematic way of guaranteeing no-nukes) is *clearly* the desired solution and I strongly support any such solution.
However, it is important to note that a non-hostile pool (one that is not seeking to destroy Bitcoin outright) has a strong incentive to police this sort of misbehavior.  This is an example of market forces doing what we want them to do: incenting good behavior and punishing bad behavior.  Ghash.io suffered, not benefited, from these double-spends.
So I think it *is* important to consider when discussing centralization risks, else we are quite likely to *overstate the risk.*
Edit: conclusion, risk-wise, I'm inclined to think that the risk is twofold - a likelihood of a very low level of nuisance events like the one this summer, and a highly unlikely but still possible scenario of an outright attempt to destroy the network by a very powerful attacker (ie. a state)
Edit edit: even though I would stand to lose a fair bit of money if this happened, I'm delighted at the opportunity for Bitcoin to demonstrate what it can do in the face of an all-out attack by a state actor, as I'm fairly confident in the long-term result: anything short of 100% destruction of the network will ultimately be viewed as failure on the part of the attacker (considering the sort of event we're discussing), and I don't think it's in any way possible to 100% destroy the network.

I agree with you that calling ghash terrorists is ridiculous.
I think the fear is not misplaced however.
Bitcoin's greatest existential threat is having an entity hostile to Bitcoin assume control of 50+ of the network and using its superior hashrate to deliberately destroy the network.
Of course that would not be rational for any actor interested in profiting from Bitcoin's long term success, as ghash seems to be. But there are many reasons to be hostile to Bitcoin, and the 51% attack is currently the most vulnerable vector of attack. People have a right to be afraid and something needs to be done to address the problem.

Though it's hard to rationalize the definition with reality sometimes. Most definitions I encounter involve some language to the effect of "must be accepted by creditors" "must be accepted as a medium of exchange" etc.
There are about a zillion types of transactions for which cash dollars (which are printed with a message declaring them legal tender that must be accepted for all debts) are not acceptable.  Including many public debts, like speeding tickets or taxes due.
So despite the specificity of the definition the exact meaning is still unclear.

You are incorrect.
Liquidity refers to the ability to buy and sell a thing *without moving its market price*.
If there are a million Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is worth $1, and I want a $10 pizza, no big deal.  But if I want to transfer $1M worth of value to you, *I have to purchase the entire money supply in order to do so.*  That's lack of liquidity.
If instead, Bitcoin is worth $1M, I can still buy a pizza, but I can also easily transfer a large amount of value to you without affecting the market price whatsoever.  That's liquidity.
If you want to tackle this problem by increasing the money supply a millionfold, you're out of luck, because the price will simply drop a millionfold.
Savers raise the value of the currency, increasing its liquidity across all markets.
And here's the kicker: the utility of a money is directly proportional to its liquidity.  In the first example, the $1 Bitcoin simply isn't capable of solving the million-dollar transfer problem.  In the second example, it solves that problem easily.  *High Bitcoin value makes a more useful currency capable of solving more problems for everyone.*


A classic example of why high school economics are horribly insufficient.
If I save Bitcoin, then *that increases the purchasing power of everyone else's Bitcoin, putting the money back to work.*
They lied to us, see?
(note in the above example I used dollars to represent an abstract unit of value.  you can substitute with any currency or just "Value Unit" if you're getting hung up on my use of dollars)

This may be too complicated for your article but I think it's the most important thing you should consider, given your audience.
For the average young enthusiast it can be hard to understand the value proposition of ever using Bitcoin like currency.  The reason is that if your income is typical, you maintain a low bank balance, so you can't afford to also walk around with a high Bitcoin balance.  Therefore every Bitcoin purchase starts with "first I have to buy enough Bitcoin to make a purchase.". The added friction is a barrier to adoption.
If you're relatively wealthy, you just *buy some Bitcoin* and hold them. So if you want to spend them, it's frictionless.

Bitcoin offers significant utility in the remittances market (even according to its biggest detractors) which in and of itself would justify a significantly higher price than $400/BTC even if this was the only thing Bitcoin was ever used for.
Bitcoin offers significant utility as a banking alternative for the unbanked. That's 3.5 billion people, including 100 million in the USA alone. Over a billion unbanked people have access to internet today and could become Bitcoin users. At the high rate of internet adoption and low rate of banking innovation, this number will only increase.
Bitcoin offers utility as a currency of last resort in nations with collapsing currencies, an event that occurs not infrequently, and as a hedge against inflation in the event that a currency inflated significantly without collapsing. In this regard it is like gold, except that it's gold thats harder to steal, weightless, transmittable near-instantly over the internet, and more divisible.
Edit: I have a minute more to answer your question. Let's not forget black market transactions where Bitcoin has proven itself useful already. This is far more than silk road but extends to things like evasion. Consider that in Italy alone something like 50% of transactions are unreported cash /cash equivalent payments (for example I can pay you by putting credit on your phone card). Bitcoin could offer great benefits as an electronic cash alternative for those who can't /won't use traditional electronic payments like debit or credit cards due to a need to hide the transaction.
All this is in addition to the obvious use as an electronic payment option where Bitcoin can reduce the processing fees associated with credit /debit cards.
There are many more arguments to be made as well. In short I think the long term (2-5 year) potential is very strong. I'm trying to type all this on a phone and my train just arrived so this will have to do for now. I'm sure others will help answer your questions as well.

Dare we add another, from the so called experts on r/bitoin who express the opinion that :




Since "volatility" is the criticism most-often cited as THE reason "cryptocurrency X" cannot succeed, and since volatility is not a technical problem but instead a market-cap problem, I'd say that first-mover advantage represents a very serious advantage for any new entrants to overcome.
For a newcomer to unseat Bitcoin it would have to have a technical advantage that was both very significant and also unable to be adapted to Bitcoin. I see this as being pretty unlikely.
If you use the comparison to operating systems, Bitcoin is open and flexible like Linux with the first-mover advantage of Windows. It's a potent combo.


This is the classic "open source vs walled garden" argument and I won't get into it here except to say that over the very long term, open source solutions appear to me to have much greater staying power.
Say the Danes or Icelanders create their own national cryptocurrency. Who in the USA or China could/would use it?
Bitcoin's most potent and obvious use is in international remittances. National or corporate coins inside a walled garden therefore do not enjoy the primary benefit of an open source coin.

It would be far more constructive for those of us in Italy to spread the legitimate uses of Bitcoin into the Italian economy rather than using it for anti-state terrorism (yes, this is a kind of terrorism).
Italy has a huge black market (25% of the second largest economy in the European Union) widespread distrust of the banks and the state, and widespread smartphone adoption. Italians have shown themselves quite capable, for example, of adopting WhatsApp to get around Telecom Italia, now we need to get them to start using Bitcoin to get around all the corrupt regional banks and state capital controls. 
TL;DR Italy should be Bitcoin Ground Zero, but this attack is energy misspent.

Lulz. It already exists. It's called a credit card. They work perfectly fine for everyone who already has a bank account in a first world country who is shopping in a first world country. Credit cards are an inelegant solution but they work just fine for most everyone who already has one. Which is why you can't really win the argument for Bitcoin with the "easier/better than a credit card" argument because credit cards are already pretty easy, well-understood, and very entrenched.
Bitcoin doesn't really solve these first world payment problems because for most people there is no problem.
Blockchain technology is essentially distributed. There is no reason for a centralized organization to use it.
For the problems Bitcoin *does* solve, (eg international remittance) no centralized organization is going to easily beat it.

Assuming there is priority given to high quality nodes, seems like the whole thing will naturally gravitate to VM clusters running at the lowest-cost centralized data center.
How is this decentralized if most of the nodes end up on AWS or its lowest cost competitor?
Even with my beefy machine and 100mb connection there's no way my home server has anywhere near the global availability and response time as a bunch of VMs running on a huge data center cluster.

I realize my post referred to a long time line. You are correct that in 50 years the money supply will not be growing in a significant way and may in fact be decreasing.
That's still a long time from now for a currency that's still only five years old.
My point is that we treat Bitcoin as though it is already deflationary when this isn't the case. New Bitcoin are created daily - judging from the price trend over the post-Willy period, more Bitcoin are created than are demanded. This is not only money supply inflation but price inflation.
For the time being we should think of Bitcoin as an inflationary currency.

The thing is the cost isn't incurred per transaction so it's a completely misleading/inappropriate metric. The costs are incurred equally among all savers through the inflationary effect. 
If I bought a bond and sold it a year later, you wouldn't say that the 5% I lost that year due to dollar devaluation was a "5% cost per transaction."
So no, don't call it a cost per transaction, hidden or otherwise, because it isn't incurred that way. 
Edit: in fact, if you buy Bitcoin to transact immediately, you transact twice but incur ZERO of these supposed "transaction costs" since you never hold long enough to be penalized by the money supply inflation.  That's why it needs to be reported as inflation, not a per-transaction cost: _it's a cost paid by savers when they save, not spenders when they spend._

You say that like it's a bad thing.
Also inflation is more like a wealth tax and less like a fee, as it is levied on you proportional to your wealth not on a per transaction basis.
Also, volume being low overstates the effect. If there were 10x more transactions, the "fee" would be 10x smaller.

Inflation can refer to inflation of prices, which is how you are using it when you talk about an inflation-like effect. Increased demand for Bitcoin can outstrip the increasing supply and push prices up.
However, the ever increasing supply of Bitcoin (for the 140 years or so) is an *inflationary money supply* meaning that in an economy of stable demand, the ever increasing supply will push prices down, not up.
Money supply inflation is what I'm referring to. Bitcoin is often criticized for being deflationary because one day there will be no more Bitcoins mined. My point us that for the duration of our lifetimes, this will not be the case.

This is why monetary policy is not a solution but rather has become the problem: it prevents needed change from happening.

If you want to call it a market, OK, but it's a highly artificial one created by the totally arbitrary reward scheme Bitcoin pays miners.
In that sense the market will absolutely solve this problem: if Bitcoin does not adopt a more sensible reward scheme, then the market for mining crypto will kill Bitcoin and choose an alternative with a better, more durable reward scheme.

Edited for clarity :
I would remove the metric altogether, or remove the block reward from the calculation (just report fees / transaction). 
The block reward is a fixed cost that has nothing to do with transactions. Since transaction fees are so tiny compared to the block reward, this ratio is basically reporting (fixed block reward / # xactions).
Metrics should be actionable. We measure mpg/kpl because it's actionable: the more wasteful I am, the faster I consume . 
Suppose instead I created a metric called "registration fees per mile" and started using it to measure and reduce cost?  Since registration fees are annual fixed costs, the only way for me to optimize that number is to keep driving forever. 
It's a measure that appears perhaps at first glance to be meaningful but in fact it is not just irrelevant but actually misleading. 
Same with this cost per transaction number. It's just horseshit. Get rid of it altogether. If you want to report something meaningful about the impact of block rewards on the economy, report it as a money supply inflation rate metric, because that's what it is and that best describes how its effects are felt (through devaluation of savings not as a price attached to a particular transaction) and by whom (holder/savers not transactors).
It's a clear case of misapplied statistics. It's just a bad metric and shouldn't be reported on a per transaction basis under any label.

OP, my opinion is that you're jumpy because you're overexposed.
Bitcoin is highly risky. Never put more money into something highly risky than you can safely afford to lose.
If you're jumpy it's because you can't afford to lose your money that you have tied up in Bitcoin.
My advice: sell half your Bitcoin now. Put the rest in a paper wallet, lock it up, and consider it lost money. Stop watching the hourly price. 
If you still can't leave it alone, you're still overexposed. Sell half again and keep going until you can sleep at night without worrying about it.

Good post, but...
I'm late 40s and y'all are all wrong. Internet began in early 1970s, email followed shortly thereafter, Usenet was around by the early 1980s, but hardly anyone could explain what the internet was in 1995 and for most everybody "the internet" was either AOL or CompuServe. *Twenty five years in and it was just getting past the "nerds only" phase.* 
It took the invention of the http protocol to really get things going and even that took another decade before it left the early adoption phase.
I rolled out one of the first websites for a Fortune 100 semiconductor company (ie highly technically savvy) in 1997 and rolled out the first email system for another Fortune 100 company in 2000, *thirty years after the invention of email.*
**This shit takes a lot longer than any of you realize/are old enough to remember.**
Edit: point is not to insult anyone. The point is that I see a lot of people on this sub who seem to expect Bitcoin to take over the world by next Tuesday at 3 PM / get disillusioned whenever there is a setback. The endgame for Bitcoin, if it succeeds, is to actually substantially displace fiat. That is not going to happen in the next year or two, but it could in a decade or two. We need patience and an understanding that Rome was neither built nor destroyed in a day.

Consider a centralization / decentralization argument. 
By decentralizing onto multiple platforms Bitcoin is less vulnerable should a defect in the platform be discovered and better positioned to take advantage of a capability offered in a different platform. Suppose .NET or some other platform was able to offer a step-function performance or scalability improvement - Bitcoin would be vulnerable to takeover by an altcoin developed on that platform. 
Not saying that supporting multiple platforms is necessarily better, just pointing out some considerations.

@_date: 2014-06-18 11:15:15


This is because a lot of people are young and have unrealistic expectations about technology adoption.
For example you see a lot of people comparing Bitcoin to the birth of the internet. NEWSFLASH: that didn't happen in the 1990s. It happened around 1970. It took 25 years from the birth of the internet until your average person started to consider using email, the most basic service.
Is Bitcoin growing faster than the internet? Seems so to me. But expecting to displace the financial industry in a few years is silly. Even Amazon, after well over a decade, still has to compete at a loss against brick and mortar.
@_date: 2014-07-15 22:06:45


My opinion is:
1. Having &gt; 51% isn't in and of itself an attack on the network. If I create a pool, and &gt; 51% of miners join voluntarily, this does not constitute an attack.
2. Economic forces discourage a rational majority pool from attempting an attack. A pool operator who is simply trying to maximize profit will behave honestly even if they possess &gt; 51% mining power because they can make more money honestly. 
3. "Irrational" actors or "terrorists" (those willing to lose money as pool operators in order to cause harm to the network) must expend significant resources in order to attempt to cause significant harm and even then it is very unclear if any lasting harm could be done, as miners are independent and are very unlikely to commit suicide en masse. While it's *possible* that miners could be induced to collectively "kill the goose that lays golden eggs," the overwhelming probability is that no attacking pool could maintain &gt; 51% of the mining network long enough to crash the price *and* hold it down. 
TL;DR it isn't a question of expecting the community to "police itself".  As long as participation in a pool is voluntary (and it is), miners are strongly disincentivized to remain in an attacking pool once the price begins to be impacted. Therefore the risk of an attack is very low and the potential for lasting harm is practically nonexistent. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:45:17

No no no no no.
Neither possible or desirable.
What *will* happen, hopefully, is that enough liquidity enters the Bitcoin system that we no longer see wild swings in exchange rate.  If the exchange rate fluctuation was more like (Dollar/Peso) or (Euro/Dollar) - ie fluctuating freely but not *wildly*, then the exchange rate problem would not be an issue.
The solution to your problem is that a lot of money - $50B? $100B? needs to get into the system.
That will happen, I believe, but it will take a while.

You are so high you refuse to read what I wrote to begin with. You keep arguing with a Chimera. Everything you wrote is for an argument I'm not making. So shut the fuck up already. You think a guy with an MBA and 25 years in  management+ entrepreneurship doesn't understand debt? Hilarious. I've paid off two mortgages already, tell me about debt.
You are so fucking far from the original point you actually think I was disagreeing with you in the first place you argumentative bitch.
I'm talking about personal wealth building, something I happen to know enough about to be personally wealthy. You're taking about  macroeconomics. Why not admit you missed the point about 8 posts back and just tip the fuck out.
Sorry but my patience with you and your rudeness and condescension has ended. You've repeatedly called me stupid and ignorant and a dozen other attacks and rudenesses which were totally unwarranted even though you missed my original point and refuse to realize you and I are talking about two different things, no matter how much I try to politely point out.
You should realize that not everyone on reddit still has braces and pimples. You're not talking to an uneducated kid. So blow me.
Edit: I'm going to add a few pointy facts.  Yes we are all taught about the money multiplying effect of debt and the importance of liquidity.  That's all lovely and NOBODY HERE DISPUTES THE MACROECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF DEBT.  CAPISCE?  But you and me, and your Dad - we individuals do not become wealthy individuals by acquiring debt.  Debt enables us to finance either (1) cars and boats and houses, which do not make us wealthy, or (2) PP&amp;E, which can make us wealthy, once it's ours.  You're talking specifically about the latter case, where debt finances investments in PP&amp;E.  That's all well and good.  HOWEVER you're still not wealthy because the bank bought you a factory.  You're not wealthy until that factory PAYS FOR ITSELF.
There are literally tens of trillions of dollars in UNPRODUCTIVE CONSUMER DEBT (and probably a good trillion or two in unproductive corporate debt too) circulating in the economy.  Probably a hundred million people in the USA alone are carrying credit card debt, car debt, and other unproductive consumer debt.  It's unproductive because it only finances consumption.  It is debt that only makes the debt holder poorer.  That's the debt I'm talking about.  And don't come back to me about how that debt helps sell more products and so the economy is helped because I understand macroeconomics and REPEAT I'm not talking about macroeconomics, but personal wealth building which comes only from one place: spending less money than you take in.  PERIOD.
DEBT &lt;&gt; WEALTH.  PRODUCTIVITY creates wealth.  You want to be wealthy?  Be productive and retire debt.  When you reach the position I'm in, where you become the lender/financier and not the debtor, then you will learn a lot about wealth, *son.*

If instead it is used for all sorts of p2p commerce, and is called "free market" or "open market" etc., then there isn't much to say or do about the illegal trade that also happens to occur there except go after it on a case by case basis.

In the case of a premine, you have to create all the money you'll ever need, up front.  When your stash runs out, it's out.  Deal-breaker. No nation state will accept that. It's the entire reason we dropped the gold standard. Governments - at least not the major ones -will never give up the ability to create and destroy their national fiat at will. You've attached a muffler to your horse. 
The only other possibility is a closed mining network where the gov controls the source code and can tweak the algorithm at will. But a closed mining network is just a centralized ledger using blockchains instead of (computationally superior) old fashioned SQL-backended ledgers of the sort banks already use. The horse now has fuel injectors and a cool wing over its tail.

No. They don't want to destroy Bitcoin. That's a paranoid delusion.
They want to sell Bitcoin products like ETFs on exchanges like NASDAQ. This is good for Bitcoin.
They cannot stop an alternative exchange for example in Jersey (the island that is embracing Bitcoin, not the state near New York). So there will be a variety of exchanges and products, some of which are unregulated (Dark products), some of which are loosely regulated, and some of which are heavily regulated. Let the market choose. There is room for everyone in this Trojan horse.

Bitcoin has a different value proposition from  Litecoin or Doge, one that depends on (1) first achieving a very high market value (2) and then becoming something that is used as currency.  It's in the white paper, part of the "original blueprint".  Other cryptos like Lite and Doge take a different, more inflationary path, one that attempts to get more coin into more hands and achieve velocity first, value later.
Without imposing a value judgement on the models, suffice to say, they *are* different and perforce Lite and Doge *will* have higher velocity that Bitcoin all other things equal, so it's to be expected that, relative to its market cap, Bitcoin will have lower velocity than Lite or Doge.

It isn't emotive. It's logical. You make the argument that a decentralized exchange won't succeed because nobody is asking for it. Nobody in 2009 was asking for decentralized money; five years later 99.9% of the world still isn't asking for it, yet I think it will succeed because the ways in which it is better cannot be replicated by any centralized entity and the ways it is worse can be addressed through continuous improvement.
A decentralized / trustless market could have many competitive advantages over eBay / a centralized exchange like SR/SR2, such as lower costs than can be provided by any single entity, support for goods legal and illegal, support for supply chain integration through open APIs, etc.
Build a killer feature or two that depends on decentralization, and you kill the centralized alternatives.

I disagree.
Have you seen the Bitcoin codebase?  It is not large.  We're not maintaining SAP here.
The key when maintaining a platform like Bitcoin is to ensure that you are implementing thoughtful, elegant solutions.
*Cranking Out Code Now* because *We Have To Do Something* inevitably ends up producing inelegant, brute force, difficult to maintain code.
If the community had tried to tackle scalability a year ago, it would have perforce deployed something quite brute force.  Instead, devs recognized that while scalability was an issue, it wasn't a *priority*, and used the intervening time to consider alternatives.  In the process, they surfaced [an elegant solution]( that while not perfect is a far better solution than any brute force scalability solution.
Here's an analogy.
Suppose that 500 years ago an alien race came to Earth with a threat.
"Solve the sixty-trillionth binary digit of Pi-squared or we will destroy your planet in 2012."
World leaders (such as they were) panic.  A clearly superior species has appeared and thrown down the gauntlet.  There is clearly no way to defend ourselves.  We have two choices:
1. Focus all human resources towards trying to solve this problem as soon as possible using all the tools available at the time
2. Do nothing, and hope for the best
As it turns out,  is the correct answer, because by *not* focusing all human resources on trying to solve the problem, humans instead invented the supercomputer, which solved this problem in 2011.
Managing platforms is like this.  You have to defer solutions until the last possible moment, because only then do you have the benefit of the maximum number of potential alternatives to choose from.

I was being a smartass to make a point. Your argument was:


My point is that decentralization absolutely can be the killer feature.
And if you find a killer feature that requires decentralization, then it cannot be effectively competed against by a centralized entity.
Your only rebuttal is to argue that there isn't such a killer feature. To me this lacks imagination, as I have pointed out several possibilities already.

ELI5. In what way do governments (plural, your word) back the US dollar?
For example, I'm in Italy. What legislation has been passed by the Italian government that protects the value of the US dollar?
The only government that backs the US dollar is the United States of America. And the only assurance that it offers re: the Almighty Dollar is that all public debt will be denominated in dollars and repaid with interest in dollars. THAT'S IT. FULL STOP.
And as we've seen around the world, as governments and societies become decreasingly able to sustain their debt loads, those promises start to look weak. The US government only guarantees the value of the dollar insofar as the underlying economy is able to grow faster than the inflation that is caused by the debt load of the government they support.

Let me clear something up.
The purpose of blockchain technology - the entire "genius" behind its usefulness - is that *it allows people who don't trust each other at all to agree on a common ledger of transactions*.
This means no central authority is needed to enforce "the one true ledger."
If you are a central authority, therefore, *blockchains don't help you at all*.  Elsewhere in the thread, you mention that government could make a blockchain and force banks to use it.  The thing is, this would offer no benefit - in fact, would be a step backward.
Government / banks operate the money system based on the idea of a "web of trust."  Once you pass all the regulatory hurdles and become part of the "banking system" you are now a trusted entity.  
But the point of bitcoin is to solve the problem of how to get parties that *don't* trust each other to come to agreement on the "ledger".  Entities that operate within a "web of trust" *don't need this*.  Mining a blockchain would be a waste of money - simple relational databases of the sort that banks have used for forty years will cost a lot less, and will actually work better.

You're missing the point that the majority of the friction in the system occurs at the borders between fiat and Bitcoin.
As a means of automating an otherwise fiat transaction, Bitcoin doesn't make a lot of sense. You have to perform two Bitcoin/fiat conversions just to perform a transaction that could have been better handled with fiat.
The goal is to create an ecosystem where people have Bitcoin, spend Bitcoin, receive Bitcoin, and never need to cross the border back to fiat. That would be near-frictionless.

3. You should be allowed to do whatever you like with money you legally obtained without any interference from the law. This includes buying or selling Bitcoin, trading it on an exchange, mixing it, etc. You have every right to privacy and should enjoy every freedom to do whatever you want without fear of investigation or prosecution.

No, it's months, and I can back that up. I'll explain as best I can, because we keep looking at Bitcoin from Joe Consumer's point of view,  and keep missing Joe Merchant's point of view. 
A card transaction can in fact be reversed for months after the sale. According to Visa 120 days or longer. 
[Source]( 
This is in fact the relevant date to be discussing. Here's why. 
When you send me a bitcoin transaction with a  0.0001 btc transaction fee and my client sees the transaction, there's an extreme likelihood that the transaction will go through. That's all the approval most transactions will ever need in a POS situation. 
This is akin to getting a card approval on a credit card. As the merchant, you don't KNOW that you didn't just get a fraudulent charge, and the funds haven't hit your account yet, but it's good enough verification for most transactions.
Now with Bitcoin there is the question of a fraud attempt in the form of a double spend. In ten minutes, you will typically be able to verify that the transaction wasn't fraudulent. By then the funds are "in your account." **Spendable.** 
With credit cards it's a whole different story. The funds aren't typically in your account for several *days.* And the charge can be fraudulently reversed for *months.* From an accounting point of view, that's a terrific liability by comparison. Particularly if you're in a business that is targeted by fraud.
Hope this helps everyone understand the tangible, real world benefits of Bitcoin to merchants. It's no small thing.

These are very similar to arguments I've been making for some time. 
Bitcoin would not be at threat from a 51% attack from a "rational actor" (one who wants to steal Bitcoin for profit).  That really should be a moot point by now. 
What we have to ask is: who are the "irrational actors" - rather - who are the "rational actors" who are willing to spend money to profit from breaking the network, how much would they have to spend, and how badly could they actually break it in a sustained attack? 
As long as actual hardware *owners* are decentralized, mostly rational and mining in pools, it's hard to game out a scenario in which the pool stays together long enough to actually hurt the network in a serious and lasting way. 
If there is ever a centralized 51% owner of hardware, that could force a fork.
Corollary: there exist Bitcoin prices and hashpower density above which trying a direct assault on the mining network becomes prohibitively expensive. I wonder what those are?

Usual disclaimers apply. Also  I don't know what I'm talking about.
Having said that you should simply look at the current bubble watch chart from It tells a lot of information about where we are in the market cycle. 
at this moment buyers aren't buying, sellers aren't selling, which is why price is stable and volume is low. The market is in a critical position where it seems likely to break up or down soon. Historically it breaks up at times like these. If an etf or nyc based exchange launches (as is widely believed) any time soon, with the market as tight as it is currently, the price will skyrocket. Conversely, a lot of speculators went long on margin anticipating a bubble by 7/24 (again, see moral_agent's charts) which so far hasn't appeared. If they panic we could see a rout. 
Trying to time the market is risky. If you're bullish long term, however, and won't spook if the price breaks down in the short term, I would speculate everything you can afford to lose now. History is on your side.

The price would definitely crash at first.  But consider this. It is not possible to conduct this attack anonymously. Everyone knows who the 51% operator is.
So who would sell this operator gold in exchange for Bitcoin, knowing they were committing double spends?  I sure wouldn't sell them *my* gold, knowing I wouldn't get paid. Plus if the price is crashing, who wants to convert their stable assets for crashing Bitcoin? The entirety of market forces are working against the attacker. 
So my opinion is that such an attack would be very short lived. The price would crash, because markets are emotional and as we know the Bitcoin market panics at the mere thought of such an attack. But rational investors (like me) who have considered the possibilities and question the that level would see the crash as a great buying opportunity. I think the price would recover quickly.

One of Bitcoins best use cases at the moment is to act as a payment rail for various payment parties who otherwise have to settle their accounts through conventional banking.
If processors like Paypal encourage use of the payment rail it strengthens the rail for everyone through increased adoption, liquidity, etc. 
The reason this is good even if you hate paypal is that Bitcoin is democratic: you have as much right to use the rail as PayPal or anyone else. So if paypal makes the rail better, you still benefit from a more robust ecosystem.
Also paypal has always wanted to be the money of the Internet. They just couldn't figure it out. I think they realize that the problem has been solved by the open source community and are trying to pivot to conform to it. IOW maybe Bitcoin can make paypal a "white hat" player.

This is ridiculous. It is patently obvious that if you want to make money in Bitcoin, buying and holding beats mining at least 10-1 if not 100-1. Most miners make little or negative returns, the most successful see healthy but not incredible roi over the course of a year or two.
Compared to Bitcoin where holding for a year or two historically has meant 10-100x gains.
So *both* communities are equally fucked if the protocol is deemed untrustworthy due to a mining monopoly, *both* depend on the continued growth of the network to sustain profitability, so both have roughly similar probabilities of success or failure.
Yet one provides incremental returns at best while the other provides potentially vast rewards.
This isn't something I made up, it's been obvious and stated for years. I first read this argument years ago when considering investing in mining gear and instead took the money and bought Bitcoin with it. Needless to say, it was a far better choice.

I started to fight with you because you clearly were in such a rush to insult and refute me that you didn't even read the four questions you answered "no" to, as at least one of them is mutually exclusive of the others.
Instead I'll reply like this since we are taking across one another.
You are discussing the *legal definition* of the "crime of money laundering".
I'm discussing the moral implications of knowingly helping someone steal money by obfuscating the source of the stolen money (the *dictionary definition* of "money laundering"), and whether or not that should be a crime in itself.
At issue is the fact that the legal definition does not align with the dictionary definition. 
You disagree with the laws as written. I agree with you. They are lousy and do not address the issues they ostensibly purport to address, but instead serve the purpose of limiting legitimate privacy-seeking behavior and/or invading that privacy. You should have a right, for example, to use a mixing service. Which, it must be noted, is *not money laundering according to the dictionary definition*.
Where we are not in agreement is this notion that you seem to have that *actual money laundering* (for example, of the sort where we set up a fake business with the specific intent of funneling stolen money through it) either does not exist and /or is not a social harm worthy of being deemed a crime.
What say you to that?
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:17:51
I was *agreeing* with you.  Edit: I was also pointing out that the classic trope that when miners stop mining they "exit" the Bitcoin economy is balderdash.  Some, at least, wait it out and use the obvious crash as an opportunity to speculate on coins.

Do whatever you want to Bitcoin. Or gold. Crash the price. Pour a trillion dollars into it. Will people stop buying gold? Neither Bitcoin. All that volatility will make people rich. Traders love volatility. This guarantees that the market never goes to zero and when the manipulator finally gets exhausted the price will actually be higher for all the velocity.

Every change becomes a risk that miners won't accept the fork. 
Best to always keep changes small and granular.
I know it seems like Bitcoin development is horribly slow, but it's important to realize that Bitcoin isn't a website or smart phone app, it's a protocol, and successful protocols change very slowly and only when truly necessary to survive. Instead features are typically added in layers on top of the protocol.

No. Your analogy is poor. The correct analogy is evading or resisting arrest.
If you commit a crime and do anything other than turn yourself in, you make me and everyone else have to pay to investigate and bring you to justice.
I'm no lover of government, but there *are* such things as actual crimes, and their cost to society is much more than just the money or property is being illegitimately gotten.
If you have a legitimate use of mixing, then mix. If you steal money and mix it to launder it, I regard that as a legitimate crime in and of itself.

You have to be really intelligent and fairly well educated to grasp Bitcoin at the fundamentals level - the intersection of CS, crypto, and economics is a pretty rough territory for most minds. 
And you have to have serious risk tolerance to buy in. 
As bitcoin becomes more widely accepted it takes less risk tolerance. As notable tech leaders like dell and paypal and Google start validating it technically, it takes less "understanding" to get on board. 
So we're going to keep seeing waves of adoption.

If your Dad can't work, if he has no way of earning income, his primary motive should be WEALTH PROTECTION. Nothing should be high risk. His money should be in places where it is unlikely to ever decrease significantly.

This is a common misunderstanding.  Tax implications of various coins does not impact fungibility.
Fungibility has do to with market pricing.  The market prices all bitcoin equally.  If for some reason "your" Bitcoin was worth less on the market than "my" Bitcoin, that would imply imperfect fungibility.
As an example, consider gold, which is considered highly fungible (any 24K gold bar is worth the same as any other 24K gold bar), but which is treated identically to Bitcoin for tax purposes.  Or oil (the poster-child of highly fungible commodities) which is also treated according to FIFO accounting rules (as are all fungible assets).
In fact, fungibility is WHY we use FIFO accounting for assets.  Non-fungible assets (say, an inventory of homes for sale) must be individually accounted for.


If that happens, then those coins will be different.  Uncolored Bitcoin ("real Bitcoin") will be as fungible as ever.

I stopped reading the neverending text wall here. 
My dictionary is *precisely* the same as yours, except for the two key words you carefully edited:


Official state actors authorizing overt acts of aggression, by definition, are not terrorists. If the USA drops a nuke on London?  Not terrorism.  If the Westboro Baptist Church drops a nuke on London? Terrorism.
You may not like the definition, but it's the definition. 
As an official act of war between states, the worst you might call the nuclear attacks on Japan is war crimes, if they were violating an existing treaty. But they weren't, so they weren't even war crimes. 
Why this obsession with those two cities?  The USA destroyed over 50 Japanese cities by conventional weapons.  They killed more Japanese in Tokyo than Nagasaki. But revisionists are just *obsessed* with these two in particular. 
The dropping of nuclear weapons on Japan was a justifiable act in WWII and could have easily been prevented had the Japanese surrendered unconditionally when fairly warned that they were outgunned. It was the Japanese insistence on a favorable settlement instead of unconditional surrender that was the proximal cause of those attacks. 
Your infinite diatribe about political solutions on the table is moot. *The purpose of war is to force a favorable political solution.*  There was a political solution available on December 6 1941 that would have saved the lives of millions of Japanese: *don't bomb Pearl Harbor*. However this was politically unacceptable to the Emperor. There was a political solution available on the 8th: *surrender to the Japanese*. This was unacceptable to the President. So the decision was made to kill each other until an acceptable political solution was reached.
That's how war works. I don't like war either. But I'm not going to rewrite historical truth just to satisfy my sense of distaste for it or to justify my erroneous revisionist views.

The merchant has to eat the fee and charge it back to you in the form of higher prices.
You pay the surcharge, you just don't see it. It's why it's hard to convince people that there is a cost to using their credit cards. But having been a merchant I definitely know these fees are priced in to what you're paying and I would definitely split the savings with my customers in the form of a 1-2% discount across the board.

Money laundering, by definition, requires that the money in question be gained illegally.  Look it up.  If you legally obtained money, then nothing you do to it is "money laundering".
If there are statutes in place - ie AML/KYC - that violate this definition, then these statutes are invalid and should be repealed and / or cases based on them should be thrown out of court.  This is the discussion that we need to have, with this level of nuance.  It's the whole point of the discussion.

You're being intentionally sarcastic but the process is exactly the same as PayPal if you use a bank account with PayPal (which PayPal will ask you to do), and yes Coinbase will make you wait to buy Bitcoin the first time, but past that it is utterly frictionless and almost immediate. If you add a credit card it *is* immediate.
So other than a slightly longer one-time KYC speed bump, there is no meaningful difference in usability.

Of course it is. That's why the federal reserve and the EU central banks raise interest rates when the economy starts expanding: more than a few percent is considered unhealthy and undesirable.

Me too. All completely beside the point however. Nobody will choose to live in a hut and work in a coal mine instead of spending their Bitcoin.
They might, however, decide to save their Bitcoin instead of spending it on a bigger TV that they purchased with zero down and balloon credit payments.

The point is that the money supply grows by ~3600 coins per day. If demand increases by less than ~3600 coins a day (no matter who chooses to increase their coin holdings: miners, investors, new entrants) the price goes down, if it increases by more, the price goes up.

Trolls are mostly unhappy, sexually confused and dissatisfied teenagers. Unable to drive the simple pleasures of childhood (kicking dogs, pulling the wings off flies, and setting fires) these poor souls are left to lurk the internet where they alternate between furtive yet ultimately fruitless masturbation sessions to anal rape porn and harassing people in discussion forums. There, they often adopt names that to them convey a sense of competence (using terms like "hero" or "banker") but to others simply serve as an enduring label of their pitiful impotence.
They are best ignored. However if one must interact with one, it's best to call them out as trolls immediately, lest you give them the satisfaction of thinking that you took anything they had to say as being in any way credible.

You're comparing the "transaction complete" time of Bitcoin to the "transaction acknowledged" time of a credit card.

If I may offer some perspective as someone with about 50% more years than you: I think in a few years you'll realize that you're still learning, you're just learning about different things that you weren't capable of appreciating when you were younger. I'm sure that sounds trite but I believe/expect/hope this will be the case for you. When I was your age I felt much as you are expressing now, but I was mistaken.
For example you are probably far more adept at relationships and complex/confusing social situations than you were at 20. You also probably have a deeper and more meaningful value system now. This is in addition to other more intellectual knowledge you are also acquiring but don't realize it because you aren't being graded on it weekly by a teacher.

Upvote for a polite reply.
The problem I have with it is the definition of "intrinsic" which is "belonging inherently to, innate, permanent, inherent"
For example the property of gold to reflect certain wavelengths of light is intrinsic. It is a property of the material that does not change. But gold's "value" only happens because humans decide to value it.
By this definition, I cannot understand how anything can be said to have "intrinsic value", since logically, the value is imputed from outside by humans, and is not an innate quality of the thing itself.
Edit: missed your link on first read. I can't read the entire linked article you provided due to time constraints but I don't know that it applies, as i suspect that Plato was speaking about moral value, not economic value).
I will simply summarize that I believe that it is oxymoronic to state that "value" (commonly defined in economics as the measure of worth, utility, or benefit that *an economic actor gains from a product or service*) can be "inherent" to that product or service absent the economic actor. IOW value lies fundamentally within the use-case of the product or service and is not some inherent property of the thing itself.
IOW there is no such thing as "inherent value"; the phrase is an oxymoron.

Right, but unlike your house, the T bill gets created out of thin air. This creates money.

I was playing with Linux software and checked out the Bitcoin client. I thought it was cool that you could mine "math money" on your GPU so I installed it. This was back when you actually could mine on a GPU.
But my GPU was really lame (not a gamer) and after a few days and no coins (which were still essentially worthless and unspendable) I quit, realizing intuitively that I was spending more on electricity than I would ever "earn" if in fact I was ever able to trade these "useless" coins.
I briefly considered buying an expensive GPU that would have worked for mining, just for the sheer fuck-all of being part of something interesting but probably useless. But I didn't, and I forgot completely about Bitcoin.
No aha moment yet.
Then a couple years later I read something about silk road, and how Bitcoins were the currency, and... Holy shit, they're worth like $100 each.
AHA! Useless internet money found a use. I also realized that if I had bought that GPU after all that I would have a few hundred Bitcoin by then....

If you make every argument using straw persons and ad hominem attacks, you are a poor debater.


Yes, or at least, most people generally.
But I have lived in a country where this is the norm so I have seen the benefit. I wouldn't expect you to appreciate the value of a debt free lifestyle instead of the rat race, houses built to last 500 years instead of 50, and starting your life with a nest egg provided by the family instead of looking to a credit card and mortgage company to help you out. It's a better way of life, but you'd have to live it to appreciate it.


Yes. I finished grad school in 1992.


When I was a kid, we had *state schools* that cost $450 a semester so anyone could go with a little work and maybe a tiny loan or scholarship.
Do you think that tuition prices went through the roof in a vacuum? It is the availability of easy, guaranteed *student loans* that has caused the tuition explosion. If people still paid out of pocket for school, schools would focus on education instead of fancy dorms and rec centers.
Free money distorts markets.


You say that as though you had investigated all possible realities and discovered that only in this bank-financed reality did you go to college. It is my opinion that without student loans your tuition would have been affordable.
Besides to go back to your Bitcoin-as-loan-killer argument, $100 in January 2013 Bitcoin will buy you a nice education today. No loan needed.
A family with the ability to save its wealth in a secure, appreciating wealth store, and without the constant incentive to wastefully spend cheap money, will become wealthy. Not a fake debt-financed lifestyle like most Americans live, but *actually wealthy*. 
This is the change I see Bitcoin facilitating in the world.

Well, everyone keeps saying, "blockchain technology is great, but it doesn't need Bitcoin."  It's like a mantra.  Blockchain = good, Bitcoin = irrelevant.
There is also this idea that blockchains can be repurposed and used independent of Bitcoin by centralized entities like banks and governments.
These people don't understand how blockchains work.
To the first point: a blockchain is secured by miners who compete with each other to profit from building the blockchain.  Without a valuable coin, miners will not build a valuable infrastructure to mine it.  Without a valuable mining infrastructure, the decentralized mining network is trivial to attack by a wealthy attacker.
This is the primary issue with alts: not that they embody bad ideas, but rather that the value proposition of (1) a highly competitive mining network, (2) mining a comparatively valuable coin with (3) relatively high capitalization *dwarfs* the value proposition of any new "altcoin ideas."
This is why in my opinion Bitcoin will remain the dominant blockchain / cryptocurrency until new technology is discovered that literally renders blockchains irrelevant.  New technologies will be layered on top of the existing protocol which will evolve slowly and purposefully.  *See: Linux kernel; TCP/IP, SMTP, HTTP protocols.*
**TL;DR: the security of a blockchain is directly proportional to the value of its coin, and bootstrapping the value proposition of a decentralized coin is really, really hard.**
This immediately invokes the second point that needs refuting: that centralized operators like banks or governments could make a coin and control it by owning the mining network.  The theory is that they would operate miners inside a "closed" network, and distribute the mined coins however they prefer.   Like a "DollarCoin."  There is also the theory that businesses etc. might spin up their own coins to create "non-money" blockchains - like blockchains that just store contracts - independent of Bitcoin, the idea being that the mining network would be closed and secure within a "ring of trust."  I think both ideas are absurd.
Why is this absurd?  Because the minute you assume a centralized mining network operating within a secure "ring of trust", there's really no reason to use a blockchain at all.  Standard SQL databases and old-fashioned IT of the sort that banks already use *are actually better adapted for solving problems of centralized computing within a ring of trust.* 
Blockchains solve the problem of *decentralized* money and *decentralized* computing.  The minute you assume a "secure ring of trust" the benefit of a blockchain completely disappears, and it actually becomes a liability.
**TL;DR: Using blockchains for centralized solutions is like attaching a carburetor and mufflers to your horse to get more "horsepower".**

You deposit 1 btc when price is $500 and lock the usd rate. When you lock, Coinapult sells your btc and holds your usd.  That's how you will always have the same account balance. Later btc goes to $1000 and you withdraw your btc. They give you 1/2 btc. You lost 1/2 btc.

One reason: because I travel and exchanging fiat sucks.
Another reason: because I'm not American and it's difficult and expensive to bank in my country.
Another reason: because I'm not American and my country's fiat is inflating at 15% annually.
I started to make a bunch of replies to prove my point but it would have been too rude.
Point is, for Americans, living in the land of the dollar, free checking, and easy credit cards, maybe Bitcoin doesn't offer overwhelming advantages. But there are billions of people with Internet but no access to easy banking, credit cards, or the almighty dollar. I'm talking about places like Italy, Spain, Mexico, India, Brazil, Ukraine, Iran...

Companies accepting Bitcoin at this point are early adopters in the experimentation phase. It's natural that many of them will give up.

That's cool.
I read about the same phenomenon in B-school in 1992 in an advance copy of "The Coming Productivity Surge " by M. Rothschild (HBR 1993). Needless to say it made a huge impression on me as I haven't read it since. But here's the summary.
The first use of electric motors was to replace the giant steam engines that powered factories. These were centrally located in buildings and power was distributed by means of shafts and pulleys. The problems of distributing power in this manner meant that factories needed to be squat square 4-6 story buildings.  Long shafts and belts are inefficient and break. Machines which required more power/torque needed to be located closer to the main drive shaft. As a result an assembly process could be a convoluted path traipsing all over a multi story building.
So the first electric motors provided only slight improvements in productivity because they only took the place of the steam engines formerly used. But then new factories sprung up which used lots of small motors instead of one large one.  This allowed for the reimagining of work processes leading to the long, linear assembly lines of modern manufacturing. 
This was a classic business re-engineering text that made a huge impression on me regarding how computerized work processes involving mainframes could be reimagined using many small computers on a network, achieving step function improvements in efficiency compared to first generation computerized processes of the sort they were still teaching in school. And the rest as they say is history. 
When B-B-C financial processes are built using blockchains, fantastic new business models will emerge the likes of which would seem as absurd today as ebay would have seemed in 1993. 
As an aside, yes, ebay seemed positively loony when it first came on the scene. "Really? I'm supposed to send money to some faceless character on the Internet and just *hope* he sends me my autographed Hank Aaron baseball card?  Yeah what could go wrong there?"

You have a credit card that doesn't charge merchants to use it? I don't buy that either. Credit cards cost ~3% when you process transactions.

There will be no strong regulatory framework and these businesses will game the political system to keep it that way. In the meantime they'll weaken the traditional banking system.
If the currency is "backed" by Facebook corporate value, how is the value reclaimed in the event of a run on the "bank?" When Facebank (or twitterbank etc) goes bust, who gets to claim their share first, stockholders or users of the "currency?" Definitely *not* the people with the currency.

Like I said, if you equate Changetip to Bank of America, then yes, all off-chain transactions are "banking."
I myself do not equate Changetip to banking and believe off chain transactions are critical to the success of crypto.
Bitcoin solves the Byzantine Generals Problem, which is how to guarantee agreement among untrusted participants. Solving this problem is difficult and costs money. It is counterproductive therefore to use Bitcoin for transactions among *trusted* parties, because this is much more easily and efficiently done with conventional database technology. Bitcoin cannot ever be more efficient than traditional technology for basic accounting among *trusted* parties - for example, two trusted accounts on Changetip.
Off chain transactions provide an infrastructure for conducting Bitcoin commerce in a way that is not burdensome to the network but which is highly compatible with it. This is very efficient.

1. Bitcoin is a protocol, like http or email. It isn't a company, person, group, etc. It isn't a program or an app or a widget.  It's an *idea.* Like most good ideas, this genie isn't going back in the bottle.
2. Bitcoin is very, very secure if you understand it. My Bitcoin are more secure than cash in a safety deposit box. This affords a unique means with which to store and move value. In this way it has been compared to digital gold.
3. Right now, you have to be fairly sophisticated to securely use it, but the technology is quickly coming that will make this trivial. Think "early days of email" - it was one a novelty tool for tech nerds, now it's used by almost everyone. Bitcoin is maturing. In a disappointing way, the death of MtGox is part of that maturation.
4. Bitcoin solves big problems, now. For example, If you run a multinational business or have to exchange a lot of currency, the ability to transact in Bitcoin is big: individuals and institutions can send Bitcoin directly to each other in seconds anywhere in the world with no banking friction and for low or no fees. Remittances and internal transfers are an immediate use where Bitcoin can lower transaction friction. Many others abound.
5. By design, Bitcoin will appreciate in price as it is adopted. This encourages adoption. For this it is mistakenly called a ponzi scheme. That is false: Bitcoin has value because it has *utility*. The fact that early adopters can reap rich rewards is just a bonus.
6. Bitcoin is and will be in the early adoption phase for several more years.

But if you're a bank, it's not economically feasible to invest 100% of your energy into a hashpower race.  Mining a blockchain just puts the mining capital expenditure problem onto the banks.
I'm sure they might end up creating some sort of access-controlled blockchain that technically does *something* but it's critical to note that *private blockchains protected by access control do not confer the security, tamper-resistant, and fault-tolerance benefits of the Bitcoin blockchain* and it's hard for some of us old-timers to understand why they are using blockchains at all. 
Regardless, it should be obvious that when you create a private blockchain, just like a private intranet, you are creating a fundamentally different beast / value proposition than the public blockchain, or Internet, and it's important not to think that one can substitute for the other.

Good post.
When people on this sub want to talk about the rapid expansion of the internet, I feel constantly compelled to point out that this lame version of the internet you're looking at here, which seemed so irrelevant and frankly dangerous to most people, was not the beginning of the internet, but rather the *internet at age 20.* And trust me the world (outside of IT futurists) still wasn't quite sure if it would ever become relevant for them.
Most WWW "early adopters" circa 1994-7 were treated with about as much gravitas as the guy demonstrating in the video. I put this in quotes because the real internet early adopters had already been using it for decades at this point, talk about marginal.
Edit: Also most people here have never used Usenet largely because it became irrelevant before they were born. But in 1988 Usenet was for us: reddit, Craigslist, xhamster, Slashdot, etc. Even by the time this video was shot, Usenet had already begun its decline. But the point is: most people don't realize that Usenet was "the internet" long before WWW became "the internet".

Really. Well you must be correct. Everybody recognized the value of the Internet. Blockbuster saw the future of online video and built Netflix. The Yellow Pages saw the future of online discovery of products and services and built Yahoo and later Google. All the record labels could tell that digital distribution was the way to to go so they jumped right on board and built mp3.com and later iTunes. Sears could tell the future of retail was online so they built Amazon. Sothebys could tell that online auctions were the future so they invented eBay.  Local newspapers could see that they needed to get classified advertising online so they built Craigslist. Etc.
Now if the Internet was such a *forgone conclusion* that everyone saw coming how is it that literally millions of people with literally trillions of dollars in capitalization could not save any of their business by making the jump online but instead had to be competed out of business by complete industry outsiders whose business ideas were by and large considered ludicrous? 
If the Internet was such a foregone conclusion how could Paul Krugman (who I admit is often wrong but should at least be able to tell if the sun is up) get it so wrong? And he was not alone. Most of the leaders of most of the business world did not imagine that the Internet would disrupt or displace their industries. Now this would never have happened if everyone could see all of this stuff coming. 
I don't know what you were doing at this time but I was a consultant selling custom internet solutions to fortune companies (semiconductor manufacturers / homebuilders / DoD / petroleum / younameit) and each and every one of them was an exercise in getting them to grasp that the question of the internet was no longer "if" but "when" and the answer was "now" and sometimes "yesterday".
Seriously, I never found one of them that saw what was coming. It wasn't obvious to *any* of them. I had a screaming argument in 1995 with an attorney that faxing would never be replaced by email and a Fortune client in 2003 that wanted to spend 8 figures with me to build a massive auto fax system because "the internet will never catch on in our industry".  In the year two thousand and three AD.

I hear what you're saying and agree that better exchanges lessen friction for both buyers and sellers. But...
Most people who already have Bitcoin also already have some way of selling. For them a new/better exchange just means a better place to sell - and new/better infrastructure generally just means more reason to believe in something they already own.
But there are millions who would but have not yet bought Bitcoin because of the friction &amp; distrust associated with buying. For them, new/better exchanges &amp; infrastructure represents trust and staying power and has the potential to bring millions of people and billions of dollars into the system.

There is nothing efficient about the blockchain. The power of the blockchain is decentralization. As a replicated database, it's horribly inefficient.
There is no need for a group of trusted actors, like a network of banks, to use the blockchain for anything. It would be slow, clumsy, and wasteful compared to modern databases and message queues. The blockchain only adds value when you have to confirm transactions with untrusted actors.

Here's the thing about a currency: the more valuable it is, the more uses it obtains. It literally increases in utility as it becomes worth more. 
With national currencies like the dollar, the gdp of the issuing nation functions as an upper limit on the value (and therefore utility) of its money. Other nations won't accept it, so the demand for it mostly stops at the border. 
With a worldwide international currency like bitcoin these national limits do not exist. 
I think that therefore we will eventually see a worldwide cryptocurrency win out. Could be Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.

If you are saying that more than "very few" "private folks" use Bitcoin, I *strongly* disagree. Hell, i'm a nerd with all-nerd friends and I'm the only one who owns Bitcoin or can explain how it works.


I'm old. I was using the internet *before* there was CompuServe. It was functional. There was email. There were bulletin boards. I could read the home town (pop 300K) newspaper before it went to print. There was even online dating (source: went on online date).
Bitcoin is *definitely* in this phase. It may be functional, but it is simply too complex for the average user to master and the providers are far too minimal to serve a significant market. Most people haven't heard of it and among those who have, precious few have any idea how it works. And generally there isn't a lot you can do with it.

If you are a business accepting Bitcoin as payment but converting immediately to fiat the tax implications are, in fact, zero.

Meh.  You had positive and negative.  A lot of people in the media were legitimately concerned about the dark market aspects of the Internet.  TV reporters would show how you could actually get your local news - in a clunky, graphic-less, black-Times-on-gray-browser - and the news anchor would shrug it off, saying, "that's nice, but who wants to go to all the trouble to hook up their modem, wait to call into an ISP, and then find and wait for that ugly thing to load, when they could have finished the morning paper by then?" to which the obvious response was "think of the future" which mainstream people can't really do.
I had arguments with attorneys in the mid-1990s because I wanted to build email systems for clients but "nothing sent in an email is admissible in court, it has to be in fax, emails are for geeks, real business needs signatures" etc..

The only thing holding back the price is good old human psychology.  Price stickiness.  Even a tiny fraction of the available markets for Bitcoin would support a price *far* higher than $500/ or even $5000/ coin.

I'm not sure if the last MIT "drop" worked, but I'd suggest keep it up at MIT.
The point is to create a local micro economy sufficiently rich in bitcoin that a closed Bitcoin economy starts to form.  That can't happen if the bitcoin released into the wild are diluted.  They have to be concentrated somehow (physically or virtually).
MIT and its environs seems like the sort of community that would champion adoption of any new payment hardware as well.
Drop the BTC at MIT.  Then do it again.  And again.  And again.  Sooner or later, if it's ever going to "stick", then this will work.

All newcomers to your blockchain have to trust the chain of transactions they're bootstrapped with and the integrity of the revocable private key they're given. Since there is no hash power race it's trivial for the chain of blocks to be rewritten by the central authority, something that's impossible with bitcoin. 
Banks trust the integrity of SQL databases with trillions of dollars.
My point stands. Your solution might provide some business value, I don't know, but it doesn't confer the same sort of benefit as the Bitcoin blockchain at all. 
That's my point. You asked at the beginning why banks would use bitcoin instead of rolling their own blockchain. Well there's your answer. Their private blockchain can't solve the same sorts of problems, and can't provide the same benefits, as a public one.

I see this as a way to give these devices trivial amounts of money so that they can perform ledger transactions on the blockchain.  This enables manufacturers to utilize the Bitcoin blockchain and all that this provides without needing to do any AML/KYC compliance and without making the consumer purchase any bitcoin themselves.
This enables any device to become "blockchain aware" and bootstrap itself onto the Bitcoin blockchain without any humans needing to feed it money.
Lots of equipment (routers, cameras, televisions, computers etc) are already in a position to steal all your information and always have been.  What guarantee does the average consumer have that Netgear doesn't have a massive data center with every packet that's gone through a Netgear router?  None.  So why do I care if that router generates a few satoshi so that it can transact every so often on the blockchain?

Anecdotal data:
Out of several dozen or so friends and acquaintances, I have only ever met one person IRL who I felt could explain to me "how Bitcoin works" with any level of accuracy.
I've met two or three people who believe themselves to understand how it works, but they don't.  I'm sure however most of them have "heard" of Bitcoin.
I don't know *anyone* IRL with my level of understanding, and I'm no Satoshi.
And I work &amp; play in tech / programming circles, so most of the friends I have, already have a tech aptitude, and maybe 1/3 are themselves programmers.
So, yeah, maybe 1/200 people are "up to speed" on Bitcoin.
Also, here's a metric: someone on this sub posted some numbers recently that showed that three of the most popular Bitcoin online forums each had roughly 15,000 *active* users.  This suggests that the *active* Bitcoin community is only around 15,000.

Right, I'm using the term figuratively.  I'm referring to any means of controlling access to the network.
My point is that, if security depends on physical control of keys that can be duplicated and / or lost, it's no better than old security models.  Shared databases protected by public/private security keys are decades old technology.
A key feature of the Bitcoin blockchain is not requiring this sort of perimeter security whatsoever.  Anyone can submit transactions, and the system is resistant to abuse or tampering despite this.

If Bitcoin is useful people will use it.  If they use it, the world will probably eventually change.
The *problem* is that many people in the community seem to think that the ancap goals are the facets of Bitcoin that should be promoted. They are not. Destroying the government or banking system may be desirable and may be the end game if Bitcoin is successful but it is not a use case. 
It would be like pitching the Internet on the basis of how it's going to bring down publishers and record labels. That may be an inevitable outcome of the Internet's success but it is not the reason for anyone to use the Internet.

However I still agree with others: the car doesn't need its own money to serve this function, and whoever has ownership of / responsibility for the vehicle probably wants the money somewhere earning interest, not in a wallet of funds on the car.

Say there are a million Apple shares outstanding at current price of one dollar, therefore Apple has a market cap of a million dollars.
Now Steve Jobs says the word "ipod" and suddenly everyone wants Apple stock. The market opens and Apple is now trading at $100/share. 
Even though only a few shares have traded at $100, and almost no new money has flowed in, Apple's new market cap is now $100M.

Your examples are hilarious :)
I agree with you about "self-maintaining" devices.  If it's a choice between paying rent and changing the oil, well, I'm not leaving it up to the *car*.
Consider a different example entirely.  Let's say you have a non-financial use for a blockchain shared among a set of devices.
If you put bitcoin on the device, then you quite likely run afoul of all kinds of potential KYC type laws because you're selling bitcoins.
If you leave it to the customer to "load" the device with some currency, they won't, because most people don't want to go buy $0.20 worth of bitcoin.
Or you can put a miner on the device and have it mine some dust, then it can participate in this blockchain autonomously, totally avoiding any regulatory headaches.

How can a peer to peer banking blockchain protect banks from each other?
I'm interested to hear this one. What sort of protection is provided, and who gets to participate in this blockchain? 
Edit: Socratic method goes over the head of many redditors.  Here's the punch line: a private "peer-to-peer, distributed ledger" cannot "enforce decentralized consensus" as suggests.
Blockchains are secure not just because they are decentralized, but because they are open and there exists a free-market race to mine them. That race is what creates the obstacle to a 51% attack.  Private/closed blockchains do not enjoy the network security offered by the hashpower race.  Remove the race, remove the security.
So, people say, just put the security around the perimeter (ie. traditional trusted network model).  But then you might as well just use a distributed replicated shared database and monitor it for fraud, because the private blockchain can't prevent bad actors from committing fraud.
I'm interested to know where I'm mistaken.  Keep your insults to yourselves.

You can solve the entire puzzle by operating a bitcoin atm in Nepal and in the workers host countries.
Edit: I agree with you that this is the opportunity we need to capitalize on. You start with ONE channel from workers to Nepal - two atms - and you make that succeed. Then add another atm in the next biggest worker market. Lather rinse repeat. 
I also have btc I might be willing to invest in this venture. I agree that if the community could just come together on a tiny number of atms (and operators) this could be a huge win for everyone.

My point was simply to compare friction.
Instead of transferring USD to me via credit card, the customer could have transferred BTC to me directly.  At $0.023 per transaction, with funds spendable in ~10 minutes, that makes the BTC transaction 570X less expensive and 1728X faster than this credit card transaction which will take ~12 days for me to see funds.
I find this interesting.
Your comment was obviously poking fun at me, so I poked back.  Of course I'm not going to stop accepting any common form of payment: I already accept several currencies, all kinds of credit cards, various payment processors, as well as Bitcoin.  All of them offer various advantages and disadvantages, but nothing comes close to the frictionlessness of Bitcoin transactions.

It's not a dumb question. And hopefully this isn't a dumb answer.
IANAL but I believe that Bitcoin becoming a foreign currency means that the tax situation would be worse. You would still have to pay taxes on gains, but you would pay those taxes on all gains, realized and unrealized.
Which means if you hold Bitcoin you get taxed on it every year even if you don't spend it. As it stand now you are only taxed when you realize the gain (spend the money).

No, the network would be peer-to-peer, with broadcasted transactions.
But each participant would store their copy of the data on their own worm drive.  Thus there would be no need to perform hashes or build a chain.  In other words the worm drive would perform the function of the blockchain for each participant - their own immutable version of the ledger.
People complain about the inefficiency of hashing.  But it's not necessary with trusted participants: you can simply mandate that they use auditable worm technology.  Far cheaper, no electricity waste, and way faster than accessing a blockchain from a database point of view.

Can you point to such an "unavoidable event?"
Natural disasters etc do not cause sudden irreversible shocks to the money supply.
The sorts of "unavoidable events" that are usually used to justify monetary policy are, in my experience, directly caused by the current banking system.
Why don't you ask your Dad this question in rebuttal:
You believe that for most goods and services, a free and transparent market will outperform Soviet-style central planning, right Dad?
Then why is it the case that MONEY, that most essential ingredient to a free and functioning market, cannot itself be trusted to a free market? Why is it the case that we don't trust a free market for money, but rather think that somehow, for this one class of asset, *government planners can outwit the free market?*
Edit: note, most rebuttals to my last point begin with, "we tried free banking in the 1800s and it didn't work." The correct response is, "we did a bad job then, and it isn't the 1800s any more, so it's time to try again."

Not just that it is decentralized, but the fact that it is open (not private) creates an open market for miners to compete with each other by adding more hashpower.
For an attacker to undermine the network, it would require outracing the entire market and acquiring more hashpower than everyone else put together.
In a closed / private network, none of these advantages exist.  An untrustworthy participant is only competing against other banks, not the entire world - and other banks are not racing to constantly add hashpower (and if so, at what cost and for how long could they profit?)

There exists among the younger generation this notion that ideas like the ATM and internet were accepted broadly and with open arms by a majority of the population immediately upon arrival.
The internet took decades to reach critical mass and even then another decade to actually penetrate into the general social consciousness. For years nobody could fathom the trust required to actually perform an online transaction. Even I scoffed at eBay when it arrived, and I'm a wild-eyed futurist.
ATMs were hardly revolutionary in the way that the internet was but they were greeted with great skepticism and took about a decade to become ubiquitous. For many years if you wanted to use an ATM you had to go to your own bank.

I don't think you understand Gresham's Law.
Gresham's Law applies only to "good" and "bad" coins of the same currency which therefore *must by law be treated as of equal value* (as in a whole gold coin vs another coin of same face value but with some of the gold removed).   Gresham's Law predicts that in this scenario, people will hold the "good" coin and spend the "bad" coin, since they get as much face value for the bad one as they do for the good one.  Holding the "good" money leaves them with more gold.  Thus the phrase "bad money drives out good" as eventually, only debased money is circulating.
Gresham's Law is applicable to different coins of some given type of government mandated money.
To compare *different* currencies freely circulating within an economy, you want Thier's Law, which states in effect:


Which is the *opposite* of Gresham's Law.  In effect, if given a choice of currencies, "good money drives out bad."

Thanks for the polite, friendly reply. I think I understand and I hope to always reply in kind.  It's hard to find good redditors.
The point I'm trying to make, possibly unsuccessfully, is that none of this is new.  I've worked as a developer since the early 1990s, and I could build this system with 1995 technology.  I know, because I built (as fas as I understand) operationally similar systems 20 years ago.
Each application shares its changes with the others.  The network is protected by public/private key encryption so that only clients with valid keys can write transactions.  Each transaction is shared amongst the network.  Voting (in the form of replication) takes place and collisions (double-spends) are noted in the database. Etc.
My point remains: I just don't see that any new infotech has actually been created here.  I can't find anything here that can't be built (better) with vintage technology.
I'm sure there is something I'm missing and I'm just waiting for a light bulb to go on....
To me, the thing that's novel about the Bitcoin blockchain, that isn't replicatable by conventional technology, is the trustlessness aspect.  As an application developer, I don't have to worry about signing and distributing and handling failures of private keys.  The system is open to anyone.  I don't have to build a miner network.  It's there for me to use.  I don't have to protect against 51% attacks, because economic incentives prevent them.  These are the real benefits of the Bitcoin blockchain.
Please forgive my hardheadedness, but I still fail to really understand how the "private" blockchain serves a role not better served by a traditional replicated database, the sort of technology that's been around for decades.  What's the private blockchain doing, specifically, that can't be done with MS SQL Server or some similar database tool?

Interesting point.
Why should I think Moore's Law won't apply to ASIC miners?
EDIT OK - I think I understand what you're saying:  Heretofore, lots of code / tech optimizations were causing ASIC miners to advance even faster than Moore's Law would suggest.  Once they advance *only* at the rate of Moore's Law, then they'll basically go obsolete at roughly the same rate as my other digital devices - phones, routers, computers, etc.  I can agree with this.  But this would still suggest that the 21 micro-miners are only suitable for obsoleting digital devices, not so much for vacuum cleaners, HVAC systems, hot water heaters, or fridges.

It's a good question. The importance is understanding that not all transactions need to be included on the blockchain. For example suppose you and I sent each other 1btc 15 times today. We could account for that ourselves, recognize that our balance is actually unchanged, and choose not to exchange Bitcoins.
This is a way of understanding off chain transactions. For example you mentioned changetip. Changetip makes extensive use of off chain transactions.

Just hearing the word "Bitcoin" in a context sentence is good for exposure but doesn't really help anyone dispel any misconceptions they may have; and honestly a lot of the people/orgs in your examples do a poor job of describing Bitcoin to the masses.
Point being, I think it's good that Bitcoin has turned the corner from "ponzi scam tulip coins" to "the Internet's first viable digital currency" but there's still a lot of education and information to dispel.
For example a 40something tech friend of mine who probably believes themselves to "more or less" understand Bitcoin revealed in conversation to me yesterday that they think that the amount of hashpower determines the number of coins generated (instead of there being a floating difficulty level that governs coin creation rate).
This is a guy with a tech job and a high IQ who has even read up on Bitcoin and he's missing a key economic feature, which is: Bitcoin is perhaps the first money with almost completely predictable M0 at any point in time.  That's a pretty amazing value proposition to a currency, and it just sorta went over his head.

No I don't think you're wrong, and please forgive me for being frustrated, but *that's just not what I'm talking about*.
I am not here in this thread to defend any specific money-laundering law and if you will read the context of the thread in which you are posting you will find that I have not done so.
I'm here simply to refute two commonly-held notions:
1. "mixing" = "money laundering" &lt;&lt; wrong, these terms are not interchangeable.  When you mix your legally obtained Bitcoin, you are not "laundering" them, you're just mixing them.  If you're laundering money, it means that you must have received that money illegally.  If you didn't, then by definition what you were doing is not laundering.
2. "money laundering hurts nobody" &lt;&lt; this is patently false, there exist examples of money-laundering in which it is clear that the people doing the laundering are doing it specifically in order to facilitate crime, making their actions morally equivalent to driving a getaway car or hiding a body.

It has all the economic instability as Greece, but a GDP the size of France, a very internet/smartphone connected user base, and a strong culture of "screw the government / banks/ euro."

This way, each machine has the ability to bootstrap itself with a little spending money.  Nobody has to buy bitcoin and load it onto the machine, nor does the manufacturer risk running afoul of money transmission laws as the machine is not sold with any money loaded on it.
If the machine has the ability to generate income for itself by performing a value added function for another machine, then it can earn a little money.  If it needs a service offered by another machine, it can spend its money. And if a large number of enabled machines exist in a meshnet, then a large amount of money could potentially flow through them, without any of them ever containing much money, if micropayments are ever a reality.
Edit: holy shit, this could enable off-chain micropayments, because the money *could just flow through them*.  Now there's something to think about.

It's quite simple.  All other things equal, money's ability to facilitate work in the economy is a direct function of its value.

Up until the mid 20th century there was no real "consumer economy" of the sort that we have today. Most clothes were made not bought. Most food was grown not purchased. There were precious few consumer goods to even purchase. Kids didn't get a roomful of toys for Christmas, they got a wooden wagon made by dad. 
In that world, where we're trying to bootstrap a consumer economy, stimulating growth is a good thing generally. And growth is easily stimulated by making money cheaper to get. That's inflation.
But if you think that it's possible that economies can reach a steady state where they cannot realistically continue to expand, then inflation becomes counterproductive.

So let me make sure I hear your design requirements:
- 1 - perimeter network security keeps out all unwanted actors
- 2 - transactions are signed into a ledger and replicated among peers
- 3 - no "hash race" is used to secure the network, therefore the blockchain does not provide "trustless" proofs
- 4 - instead participants use the blockchain to signal acknowledgement of receipt of transactions, and some supermajority of acknowledgements connotes a "valid" transaction
I could easily build such a system using 20-to-30-year-old technology.  I could build the basic back-end of the shared ledger in a day.  No blockchains, no crypto needed.  Why incur all the cost and effort and waste of using blockchain technology?  What is the blockchain doing that is special?
Assuming a "coin" on the private network represents fiat (dollars), what prevents an untrustworthy bank from operating fractionally?  Legal compliance, presumably.  This means banks are still fragmented along national / jurisdictional lines, and the blockchain isn't really helping with cross-jurisdictional settlements in the way that Bitcoin's blockchain can.

The CPI is calculated based on the average price of a basket of goods. This basket changes over time, so some would argue the number is of questionable utility.

Completely agree.  Typical consumers using Western Union just want to show up at their local Western Union and discover a better, faster, cheaper Western Union, with no effort needed on the part of the consumer.  That's just human behavior.
Likewise, people using Windows computers don't want to switch to Macs, they just want a more stable, secure, easier to maintain Windows computer.  For that matter, people with horses and buggies didn't want *cars*, they just wanted faster, stronger horses that didn't get ill or break legs or need to sleep.
I know you think I'm being snarky here, but that's not the intent.  Consumers / users always have to be separated into pioneers / early adopters / mainstreamers / laggards and observed / discussed / communicated with according to their classification.
Mainstreamers and laggards will *never* seek out change.  Change is hard and disruptive and sometimes doesn't work out.  It's understandable that people would shy away from change and disruption.
But pioneers and early adopters *do* embrace change.  These are the people to whom we need to be talking about the cost of converting an essentially free remittance to their local currency, so that they can explore options that could help them out.

It's a bogus statistic because the effects are felt through inflation not transactions. 
Inflation is felt by holders of currency, not users of currency. If you buy bitcoin today and spend it today, you've committed two transactions, but paid zero of the "cost" as you were not affected by inflation.  It was me, the holder, who paid for your transaction through inflation.

I couldn't care less about the existing system. I have twenty years experience in business process re-engineering. My entire career is based on throwing away and rearchitecting fundamentally broken process, not "improving" them. 


Yeah. We disagree here, as the endpoints are the non value added steps. Converting from dollars to rupees or shells is entirely wasteful: value goes in, friction occurs, less value emerges. That is the sort of step I've made a career out of eliminating. 
The good news is: any time there is a non value added step in the process, then if it can be removed, it creates a win-win for all the other participants. It's like this:
"Hi boss, if you'll pay a portion of my wages in bitcoin, I'll take a 5% cut in the Bitcoin portion of my pay." Most bosses say no, but some say yes, because 5% is non trivial.
"Hi landlord, I'll pay 5% extra if you'll accept Bitcoin." Most landlords say no, but some say yes, because 5% is non-trivial. 
Worker gets rent paid in bitcoin, saves 5% on rent which for the impoverished can account for 50% of their income. Worker saves a total of 2.5% of their annual income just by switching rent to Bitcoin. No "endpoints" needed.
Now maybe the worker doesn't have to offer the full 5% to the landlord or employer. That's money that goes directly into the workers pocket. Maybe there is a local utility or shop that will also accept Bitcoin, so things besides rent can be paid directly.
This thing I just described? Not a lie. Not a fantasy. It is already occurring. Why shouldn't it? It is economically efficient: it leaves everyone involved (except the middlemen) better off.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:38:46


Two answers to that:

My fantasy involves nothing of the kind. My fantasy involves educating these people about the possibility that, if they can make a different currency work for them, then that currency could offer them a possibly life changing benefit. That is fact and people are already benefiting from it. 
But moreover, you have point blank called me a liar. Where I come from, that's a serious claim.
You aren't being very pleasant. Why do you wish for the disadvantaged to not learn where their money is being wasted or for them to save it? Why do you call the people who would fix this problem "liars?" What's the agenda? Are you personally threatened by competition to Western Union? Do you work for them?

Yes it is a matter of opinion. Well informed opinion. I've been at this a good long while. Sounds like you have too. 
I think I need to be clear about the "skill" I meant - in referring to the "business management skill of effectively managing a giant piece of infrastructure" not "engineering cleverness" (which frankly I would argue AWS has in spades as it remains very innovative but nevermind for now.)
In my opinion security is 10% engineering cleverness and 90% business priority and ability to unwaveringly follow rigid procedure. Maybe 95% business /5% engineering.
A small handful of excellent security engineers can design all the security architecture needed for the largest organizations. What is then needed is *rock solid business process execution and manageable dedication to make continued infrastructure investments*.
You don't hire the best and the brightest to become systems administrators (as opposed to architects): generally speaking, you hire the most honest and rule-abiding. Unlike dev, where extra bodies get in the way of the brains, in administration, it takes more bodies than brains to do the job right. 
This is because where most companies fail is not due to a lack of engineering cleverness but a lack of business-level commitment to do infrastructure right, and to follow procedure, every time, no matter how much it costs or how trivial the shortcut would be.
Here's the point I'm driving at: unless a company is itself in the managed hosting business, then IT is just a cost to be minimized, because the actual value chain isn't to provide IT but to provide some other product or service. There will always be some other business priority that gets in the way of infrastructure development, because there will always be business needs more closely tied with the actual product or service than IT is.
But a hosting provider has a strategic incentive to always keep investing and doubling down on its IT investment because *it is the strategic value chain.*
For this reason - and also because I've been in IT management in enough major companies and seen this play out ad nauseum to have formed strong opinions about this topic - I believe that AWS is almost always the correct solution space for all except the very most capable companies. 
Thanks for a good convo.

The thing is they aren't obsolete.   In fact they're as necessary as ever, and the major labels remain profitable. The minor and indie labels are largely extinct. 
If you think that they aren't obsolete, try doing everything that a label can do as an individual artist.  It's a lot more than just raising money on Kickstarter. For example if you're on a label, the label can usually get you on as an opener for one of its larger bands. If you're independent you probably lack the kind of access that can get you ten dates with an established act. 
That's just one of many examples of the kinds of artist support that's painfully missing in the new disrupted world. Maybe in the future a service will arise that provides all the other shit artists need. I have no idea who will pay for it though. Currently it's the major acts that still fund the remaining labels that account for the vast majority of all consumed music. When they're gone? Who knows.

Because something has cost does not mean it has value. 1st rule of business: Value and cost are unrelated. Ideas have value only if they are considered useful by others. Entertainment has value only because people desire it. 
Coins do not have value just because someone makes them. Like everything else - even air - there is no intrinsic value in the object. *The value is assigned from outside, by collective agreement.*
Take asbestos. At one time it was valueless, because nobody understood the flame retardant properties. Then it became prized once people learned how to extract utility from it for fireproofing. Then we learned it's deadly (highly carcinogenic) and now it's actually a *liability* - if you have it, it literally lowers your net wealth. 
From worthless to precious and now it actually can have *negative* value. The underlying element however has not changed in billions of years.
Value is assigned by the market. It is not intrinsic to the thing.

Porn was the Internet's first successful commercial use case and it soured a lot of people on the commercial Internet at the first.  When e-commerce first started, it was weak tech, and people got scammed easily.

I'm not 100% sure about the impact of the decrease in daily mined coins.
Currently there are roughly 360,000 coins transacted daily onchain, of which only about 3600 (1%) are newly mined coins entering the money supply. If we include offchain transactions (exchanges) where the volume is much higher, then the ratio of daily new coins/total daily volume is even less significant.
After the halving, the number of new coins mined daily will drop from ~3600 to roughly 1800.
It's hard for me to think that removing 1800 coins from a market that is exchanging over a million daily will dramatically move price (needs to double in order to keep mining profitability equivalent) but I suppose it's possible.
I think a more likely scenario is a combination of slight price rise and some miners exiting, later followed by a price drop as speculators realize that the halving did not double the price. But again, I could be wrong.

You're dead on.
What's worse, if there's a crash, your Bitcoin becomes susceptible to bank run mentality if enough people try to exit and discover they can't.
That didn't happen with Gox because (a) there was still lots of spare block capacity and (b) Gox was mostly just an exit from Gox, not Bitcoin generally.
To prevent runs, there must be ample slack transaction capacity. If there is not, risk of holding the asset is increased.

Let me break it down for you.
There *was* a high cost to switching for MySpace *for the entrenched users* who were dependent on the preexisting network effects of MySpace.
These were largely musicians because MySpace had mistakenly fallen into the trap you are falling into, **which is to presume ones early adopters are representative of the overall market**. This is a common start-up error.
MySpace's early adopters were musicians, so MySpace chased that market, and mostly owned it.
Of course the much larger overall market for social media never even tried MySpace, which was pretty well suited to musicians but terribly suited for your grandmother.
Once the larger market started using Facebook, which wasn't targeting a niche use case, musicians discovered much to their surprise that their entire MySpace audience had left them *holding the bag* with a well-curated and connected MySpace page that nobody visited anymore.
Now replace MySpace with Bitcoin and replace musician with gold bug and replace Facebook with Altcoin and you're most of the way there.

First of all you'll be hard pressed to find a team more competent than AWS. Their skill trumps any perceived vulnerability. I've worked hands on in corporate data centers for Fortune 100 manufacturers, semiconductor company, a telco, a defense contractor etc and I'll take AWS hands down over any in house IT team I've ever run across, not even close. 
Secondly,  even if you were competent enough to build a more secure hosting surface than AWS, at what cost for equivalent worldwide availability and uptime? 
That's the problem. All other things are not equal. To have worldwide availability you need plenty of redundancy preferably on two continents. This means staging staff and hardware. Which means a cost perhaps 100-1000x the price of managed solutions like AWS.

Yep. One day. Probably. 


That's a nice belief but it is not indicative of reality at all. Probably every piece of music you know by a musician who actually makes a living making music was promoted, without which you would never have heard of it.


Bandcamp does a great job for artists. It gives them full control of their product, offers lossless downloads, handles all payment processing, and takes less than half of what iTunes takes. And there is no barrier to entry. Problem is, nobody wants to consume their music there. I make 100x from iTunes what I get from Bandcamp. 
The problem isn't the 15% that goes to Bandcamp. It's the 99.9% of consumers that prefer to use services like iTunes. 


I have a blind friend who can ride a bike. Let's not pretend it's the norm. For every Radiohead I can find literally 100,000 artists for whom that model is not working. 
Radiohead is actually a perfect example of how an established band can exploit the vast audience delivered to them by their record label, NOT an example of how a band can become successful without one. 
When artist X (I'm looking at you, Amanda Palmer, but Radiohead works too) builds a huge career on the back of a record label, then uses that platform to declare "I don't need a record label anymore", that artist does a disservice to everyone. Particularly other artists.

The only value added service WU offers that Bitcoin does not is *currency exchange.* Everything else WU does can be done better, faster, and cheaper with Bitcoin.
When people discover that they pay 15% just to convert their money from dinars to rupees, or from Bitcoin to shekels, then an incentive is created for them to just stay in the source currency, in much the same way that dollars or dinars become a shadow currency in these countries. 
The thing is, they don't need an entire Bitcoin economy to exist in order to spend Bitcoin locally and benefit: if even only one person in a workers life - their landlord - would accept Bitcoin, considering rent can be 1/3 - 1/2 of a workers income, a 5-15% savings would represent 1-3 weeks of extra income in a workers pockets.

The current blockchain may not be "perfectly" decentralized but you're missing the point.
So let's say I'm an untrustworthy bank. What prevents me from acquiring hashpower or stake and executing a 51% attack on this closed blockchain with otherwise fixed hashpower?
Let's say I'm a non-bank attacker.  What keeps me out of your network?
Blockchains are secure not just because they are decentralized, but because they are open and there exists a free-market race to mine them.  That race is what creates the obstacle to a 51% attack.  In a private blockchain there is no such race, and therefore, no equivalent security.
My experience with these questions is that if you game it out, security for a private blockchain looks like:
- 1 - perimeter network security to ensure non-approved actors can't play on the blockchain
- 2 - centralized management to eject bad actors should they emerge
The blockchain in this model serves no purpose past being an inefficient database.  It does nothing to create "trust" in the transactions, because without the mining race, "trust" does not exist.

Very well. I will ELI5.
In order to move money from one WU location to another, actual fiat has to be reconciled in actual bank accounts. Running an update on a SQL table doesn't do it. That's just internal accounting. Once money goes into or pops out of a remittance process, WU ultimately is going to have to transact at a bank, and perform regulatory compliance, and experience loss due to theft or tax or whatever. So you cannot say that it is free for Western Union to move money.

If you have enough income that you can afford to diversify into some riskier investments, you can probably beat inflation.

I got downvoted for facts so I'll point it out a different way.
Me and all the musicians I know are on iTunes, Amazon, Bandcamp, Pandora, YouTube, etc etc etc.
Where do most artists sell most music? At shows. Why? Because without a record label it's still mostly impossible to get FM radio airplay. And roughly half of all new music discovery still happens on FM radio. 
And those artists who do sell, sell on iTunes, not Bandcamp which takes half what iTunes takes, or on their own websites where it's pure profit. 
TL;DR consumers still discover music on FM radio and buy it on iTunes so big businesses are still in control of your music; however, small labels got disrupted out of existence, therefore upshot artists are largely fucked, at least for now.

That's because they are.  They're very different.  A Bitcoin transaction being used as an LN token is a derivative asset.  By definition, that makes it different from the underlying asset from which it derives its value.
This is patently obvious with a simple thought exercise.  LN is very successful at scaling Bitcoin and lots of people are using it everywhere.  Then a fatal flaw is discovered in it and everyone races to close their payment channels.
1. That the payment layer can experience a fatal flaw that doesn't affect the settlement layer should be enough to demonstrate that regardless of what we call these transactions, they are fundamentally different things.
2. When everyone races for the exit, and the queue to process an onchain transaction grows from hours to days to weeks, and price to settle becomes very very expensive, the value of Bitcoin locked in an LN channel will wildly diverge from the value of Bitcoin available to make an onchain transaction.
The converse also holds: some new use for LN is discovered that's so amazing, that everyone has to have it.  Suddenly, Bitcoin locked in LN channels can be used for this thing, but "onchain" Bitcoin can't.  Now there's a race for the entry door, and Bitcoin onchain are worth less than LN Bitcoin.
The mere fact that the price *can* detach, or that the L2 can fail while leaving the L1 unimpacted, demonstrates that the assets are different.
When you grok that the assets are actually different, then everytime someone says, "But LN transactions *are* Bitcoin transactions" as if that's the end of the discussion, your head will explode, as mine does daily.

Some people understand that $6B market cap is totally insignificant for a world currency and understand that the way to get to $60B or $600B is to scale onchain transactions by orders of magnitude.
We understand that we have been paying for scaling through years of inflation which hurts all of us, but which was historically worth it to "loss lead" and bootstrap an entire economy. But miners took the block rewards and did not scale transactions. Instead they're trying to squeeze fees. If mining is going to be fee based already, instead of continuing the decades long expansion planned for in the inflation schedule, then I believe they are attacking Bitcoin's best strategy for growth.
I also wholeheartedly reject the assertion that growth=centralization. Bitcoin was most centralized when it was least adopted. Adoption drives decentralization.

Things do not have value just by virtue of having been made. I re-ask: what is the value of radioactive waste - something that people un-value so much that they are *willing to expend great energy to not have it.*

You are conflating remittance with currency exchange.
Bitcoin *remittance* is very fast, almost free, and involves no middlemen or "endpoints".
Currency conversion to fiat is where the friction is felt.
I bring this up because it's essential to understand where the friction actually lies, else it can't be properly understood. People keep discussing the problems with using Bitcoin for remittances. But *there is no problem with using Bitcoin for remittances*. It works fucking perfect. The problem is currency conversion.

Man, I was the editor of an actual "primary reference" who was dragged into a Wikipedia edit war on a subject on which I am expert so I know firsthand that most of what passes for "academia" on Wikipedia is in fact the favoritism of a small number of uninformed neckbeards.
A journal which covers only one topic can't be a source for that topic... Yikes, I guess that rules out *pretty much every scientific journal*. In the edit war I was part of, it was argued that my article (which was the seminal article on the topic and actually formed the entire original basis of the wiki page to begin with) couldn't be used because it appeared on a "blog." The journal was called a "blog" because it "listed its content in reverse chronological order." Never mind the fact that it had a staff of fifteen writers and two editors, and that every other online publication also fits this description of a "blog."
Believe what you want about Wikipedia, but I've heard enough similar stories from others that match my experience to know that "academia" plays only a small part of the vast power struggle that is Wikipedia.

Fungibility isn't boolean.
Friction can affect fungibility.
As an example if most merchants stop accepting pennies, and the only way to convert pennies to dollars is to take them to a special bank and wait a while to get them changed out, then pennies are less fungible than other currency units, by definition, even if their face value is always observed at the special bank.
Clearly in this scenario, if someone offers you five pennies as change, you demand the nickel instead, because the pennies *aren't worth as much to you* as the nickel.

This is a subtlety lost on anyone who is not a mathematician. To laypeople, calculating the output of a complex function is "solving an equation." I have a graduate degree and couldn't for the life of me explain the difference. It's appropriate that any publication (except perhaps an IEEE paper) not expect the reader to know or care about the semantics. 


It functions as a lottery *biased toward those with the greatest function solving power*. "Clever" no, but "smart" (in terms of hashpower) yes. So it's appropriate. 
Telling people it functions like a random lottery would be even more misleading as this statement implies mining is only a game of luck that anyone has an equal chance of winning.

That is absolutely true.
Let's consider the mechanics by which LN achieves "truly p2p" scaling. Let's say you wanted to use LN to get Visa-like scaling. Bitcoin can do ~3tps, and for the sake of round numbers we'll say Visa does ~3000 tps, or 1000x more than Bitcoin.
You spend $5 each day in a coffee shop that takes Bitcoin and you'd like to use LN to get 1000x scaling. To open and close a Lightning channel, you'll have to make two onchain transactions. To get 1000x scaling, that means you'll need to be able to make 2000 LN coffee purchases, which would require you to open the channel with $10,000. Needless to say that isn't happening, especially when you then multiply that by every merchant with whom you'll ever want to transact. It seems a very unlikely emergent architecture.
I think that LN is good tech that will help solve certain scaling issues, but if "p2p cash" is your thing, I remain unconvinced that it can really scale that.

Yes. They provide currency conversion.
That's the point. We agree.
Let's go further: the cost of that currency conversion is extremely high in many cases. It's only necessary because the local economy doesn't accept alternative currency.
So to summarize: the only value added service that WU is offering that justifies the cost is currency conversion, since an almost free alternative is available in another currency. 
Therefore the message / discussion needs to be that migrant workers are sacrificing a high percentage of their hard earned income to *convert it to local currency*.

Moreover there are any number of valid reasons for not disclosing the nature of the attack *at this moment* that completely trump your need to know.

You are correct, but you make the assumption that miners are well connected with the economic majority of users and nodes and therefore will make informed decisions that lead to higher coin value.
Some miners may become insular, and make decisions that are detached from the economic majority. In that case, OPs concerns are valid.

Except individual banks were creating paper currency based on that gold at 9:1 ratios so the money supply continued to inflate. Before paper currency, gold was still being found at a fast rate inflating the money supply.  And nations would plunder the gold of other nations causing wild swings in the national money supply of a given nation. So even if the underlying value store (gold) was deflationary, the way it was used as money was far too chaotic to draw any conclusions about the deflationary nature. 
So no it hasn't really been done. At least not in anything like the mathematically controlled supply we have today.

Actually I think it would be the case that Bitcoin spread out across utxos is less fungible if they simply can't be spent as needed or if spending them incurs significant friction. That's not the case in your example, however.
If say, you had 1 BTC spread out as dust over 100,000 addresses so that it simply *couldn't* be spent without significant cost and work then I might say that fungibility is decreased.
A way to look at it is, if someone wouldn't be willing to make change with you, a fungibility issue is likely lurking in there somewhere. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 11:39:51


Consider a world of interconnected devices all transacting bitcoin at high frequency (I understand the blockchain will not natively tolerate this).
A device that is constantly receiving a steady trickle of bitcoin from its downstream consumers (like a router) doesn't need a lot of btc in its wallet to then make steady streams of payments upstream to its providers.  All it needs is a buffer of funds.
A little queuing theory tells you that with even a small buffer of funds in its wallet, with frequent low-variability payments, a device can still move a lot of money through itself.

But it really wasn't. You are looking through the rose colored glasses of hindsight.
In 1994 virtually no companies considered the internet in any way relevant to their business operations. Videos came from blockbuster. Books came from borders.

I worked in the industry at this time. I watched as my clients failed to anticipate the changes the internet wreaked on their businesses.
This is why the "Bitcoin is like the internet" analogy is important - people need to remember that the internet was twenty years old before it started being adopted by regular people. People would like to believe that the value proposition was obvious and that adoption was rapid. Neither is true.

I read the thread but seem to have completely missed your point here.
Clearly Bitstamp has several conflicting duties to its customers:
.1. To resume trading as quickly as possible 
.2. To perform a complete investigation into the crime 
.3. To take steps to prevent a repeat of the crime 
.4. To provide a complete report of the crime to its customers as well as steps taken to mitigate recurrence. 
You seem to believe this should happen linearly: first an investigation, then a correction, then a report, then they come back online.
I disagree.  Odds are very good that Bitstamp has some idea what the attack vector was (for example I'd bet they know if it was an inside or external job) and therefore can take steps to come back online as well as mitigate future attacks without having 100% of the details.
I've managed a site that was taken out, and we triaged exactly as Bitstamp is doing: revert to known clean code, move to new bare metal, and get back online while simultaneously performing an investigation. Because we have a duty to our customers to be online.
**Moreover** they may be instructed by law enforcement not to discuss the break in or they may even believe they are in a position to catch the thief. This alone would warrant not divulging details until that possibility was gone and law enforcement had given the go ahead to discuss the event.
TL;DR we aren't in a position to assess whether Bitstamp is behaving appropriately or not, but nothing indicates they aren't.

That's the most salient point you've made in the whole discussion. Have an upvote for correctly identifying the actual "Bitcoin experiment."
You take the cynical view that wealth is inherently centralizing. That's interesting. If so, what value does Bitcoin actually offer? Is it just a short term bubble that enriches the 1% of its wealthiest holders?
Or if your theory is correct, will not the actual 1% - who hold zero interest or investment in Bitcoin - simply walk up and take the value away from Bitcoin when the mood suits them?

Dollars are not a derivative of some other value store, but if they were (ie, if they were still backed by gold) then *dollar velocity would not imply gold velocity.*

*If* they hit the target, on release date, we'll get maybe a few percent bump.  In order to get the full benefits promised by SegWit, everyone needs to be running a SegWit-capable wallet or node.  As we've seen, Core nodes are quite slow to upgrade.  Wallet software also takes time to modify.  And we don't know if SegWit will really be ready in a month anyway.
SegWit is good, but it isn't a solution to scaling up bitcoin.


I think miners are hoping that transaction demand is relatively inelastic, so as the network congests, they'll see their fees go way up in value.
I think that demand is actually very *elastic* and will easily spill over to altcoins because it's trivial to convert coin form, so as the network congests, the miners lose money.

First off, blocks will never be unlimited, because there are natural disincentives to mining a larger block.  Did you know that for every additional transaction included in a block, orphan risk is increased?  Miners want to keep blocks small.  So there is a natural cost, and price for every transaction.
Secondly, we only recently hit the limit.  For all of Bitcoin's existence, there has been extra room in every block.  Did you know that most people still paid fees for most typical transactions?  See point 1.
Thirdly, 2X transactions = 2X fees.  See point 1.

By this definition Bitcoin is already an altcoin since it already forked and is now using different consensus rules from its original rules. 
You will need a better, more consistent definition. 
Try this one:
The fork of Bitcoin originating from the Genesis block which is protected by the most proof of work and accepted by the most nodes is Bitcoin.
Any minority fork is not secure and is neither Bitcoin nor an altcoin but just an everyday garden variety fork that a minority of people are still accidentally building on top of. I say "accidentally" because nobody would rationally build on a minority fork: such forks are quite insecure and can be trivially attacked if they remain on the same mining algorithm as the majority fork. 
In a *failure of consensus*, in which people on the minority fork wish to continue to transact according to the *minority* consensus rules, those people cannot continue to use the Bitcoin mining algo (the majority chain) because being on a minority chain means it's trivial to attack. These people will need to change the mining algo if they want to preserve the coin according to their preferred consensus rules.
Until this point the minority fork could still recover and become the majority fork and "be Bitcoin again." once the algo is changed, however, at *that* point the minority will have split off from the majority and created an actual altcoin with its own ledger separate from Bitcoin. Until this point there were no altcoins, just Bitcoin and its minority fork.
Any number of clients with any number of different consensus rules can still agree on the validity of the blockchain. All such clients are "Bitcoin clients" as they produce blocks recognized as valid by a majority of the network. 
Anyone knowledgeable who says otherwise is probably lying to you.

Throwing more devs at a project is usually counterproductive.

What's missing is consensus on what changes needs to be made and how best to make them.
As consensus emerges the changes will be made. 
Bitcoin is a protocol like http. Like http it should (and will) change slowly.
Being able to trust that a protocol isn't going to change willy-nilly encourages developers to build on top of that protocol.

I appreciate that you are new around here but I assure you that the idea that "the block size limit is here to stay" is brand new, and probably limited to you alone.

Velocity only in the tokens used to transact. 
LN uses unconfirmed, unbroadcast Bitcoin transactions as its value token. These would have high velocity, if LN is widely used.
But the velocity of a derivative is not the velocity of its underlying value base.
An example of this would be a bunch of mortgage companies buying and selling each others's mortgages in a trading frenzy. The velocity of mortgages is high. The velocity of home sales is still low.

To expound: everyone else in the Bitcoin ecosystem is harmed if anyone mines coins in violation of the consensus rules on inflation. There is therefore no network incentive to change the rules. 
Other consensus rules, on the other hand, do not produce such clear outcomes. Some consensus rules harm some participants while helping others. Those rules should not be considered "immutable", as there exists network economic incentive to alter them. The only question is if there exists sufficient economic incentive to overcome those who are invested in the status quo.

That's your problem right there. There is no relativity in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is not the arbiter of anything.
If they were, then Bitcoin wouldn't be permissionless, would it? It would be "Bitcoin, brought to you by Bitcoin Core" and it would be signed so that only a Core client could validate blocks.
Bitcoin doesn't work like that. Anyone can write a client. The consensus rules are owned by the economic majority of users, not a dev group.

You had the right answer the first time. 
There is no *authority* in Bitcoin other than "what's the longest chain."
Theymos is playing tricks by arguing that the longest chain can somehow emerge magically unvalidated and not tracking economic consensus. Starting with that absurd assumption, any number of faulty conclusions may be reached. 
But start with a normal assumption: let's say you understand how Bitcoin works and would like to participate in it. How do you choose to follow existing consensus?
**You inspect the longest chain and follow the rules that others used to build it.**
There is literally no other way to "follow consensus."
Consensus is an emergent property. There's no way to conform oneself to an emergent property other than to *observe it.*

Your terminology differs as well.  Makes it hard when you are claiming "Gresham's Law" when actually you're talking about Thier's Law.


No, I'm saying both are true, but it depends on what sort of monies we're talking about.


No, that's incorrect.  The term "driving out" the Peso is a red herring, it doesn't imply killing some other currency completely, it implies that it's displacing it, which is certainly is doing.  But the quotes I referred to are the layman's common ways of referring to the effect.
Sorry we're on a tangent, I was just trying to point out that the effect you were talking about was that described by Thier, not the one described by Gresham.  Peace.
Edit: maybe this will help.
IF Argentina *recognized* the dollar as well as the peso, and *made them equal in the eyes of the law* in all ways for commerce, and *legally tied the peso to the dollar 1:1* (this part is essential) such that people could use either currency but had to treat a peso like a dollar for commerce, but they continued to debase the peso continually, then people would *stop exchanging dollars*, but hoard them instead and trade only the debased currency, the peso.  Because when it comes time to pay at the store, you look in your wallet, and there's a dollar and a peso, and they both spend the same, so you hand over the peso, because you know the dollar is worth more in every way except in Argentinian law.  This is the effect predicted by Gresham.  Now take away the law that says "merchants have to accept either currency and pesos are always = dollars" and just allow people to use either currency at whatever the natural exchange rate is, and people start using dollars, because the government didn't impose a 1:1 exchange rate on them.  That's the effect predicted by Thier et al.

The way Nakamoto consensus works, it is extraordinarily unlikely that a fork will ever create two coins.
If there is actually a 50/50 split in "human consensus", then it is terribly unlikely that a blockchain fork would ever initiate, because neither side has sufficient hashpower to ensure they can defend their chain from attacks by the other side. A 75% supermajority is really the minimum majority a miner needs to believe exists before he will rationally embark on a fork.
75%+ is a kind of magic number because it means that the fork with &lt; 25% can be attacked by the majority, still leaving 51% hashpower to mine the majority fork. So no miner would rationally mine a fork with &lt; 25% hashpower.
If a fork happens that causes 1-25% of users to leave the system, these people can change the POW algo, formalizing their minority fork into a separate altcoin that can't be attacked by the majority, but again, this is very unlikely, because the value of these minority-fork altcoins would be much lower than if they left the coins on the Bitcoin chain.

To understand the question it is useful to consider how miners, nodes, and wallets have evolved.
Let's start by considering first generation Bitcoin. With Bitcoin as originally created, each wallet is also a node is also a miner.
It's easy to see how this network will not make a change that will be rejected - the miners are also the users and node operators. So machine consensus tracks human consensus closely.
Now, let's separate these players. These days, most miners are people in a faraway country that comparatively speaking has few nodes and users.
The risk is that the *machine consensus* generated by miners can become detached from the *human consensus* of the market of nodes and users that they serve.
In theory, miners only want to make changes that users want. But since miners and users can become detached from each others care-abouts, it becomes more possible that they will introduce a change that is refused by the economic majority of nodes and users.
If the miners try to make an undesirable change through a hard fork, the system can protect against a price crash if enough nodes refuse to acknowledge the change. Nodes refusing blocks that they consider invalid is a critical protection against harmful changes being forced into the network.
If the miners make an undesirable change through a soft fork, then existing nodes cannot refuse the change. The only way for a user to refuse a change that has been soft forked onto the network is to exit (sell their Bitcoin and shut down their miner).
It is for this reason that all nontrivial or possibly contentious changes should be put to "Nakamoto vote" by requiring a hard fork instead of using a soft fork. Yes, the soft fork is more expeditious, but it carries a significant risk if miners guess wrong, because while they will have machine consensus, they will lose human consensus, possibly causing a sell off.

My idea is that Bitcoin must remain permissionless because it must remain out of reach of capture of special interests.

No, his comment explains why your  scenario is a red herring that makes no sense.
You start by presuming Bitcoin is already completely broken (miners ~~choosing~~ forced to break away from the economic majority and commit economic suicide) and then try to make a point based on that assumption.
If such a disastrous thing (complete failure of the network to reach consensus) were to happen then neither competing fork can be said to be Bitcoin until the contention is resolved. Once resolved (as you point out by voting the old miners out through hardfork and mining a different algo altogether) then I'd imagine we'll change the name if not the coin entirely after the total humiliating failure.

You are starting with the premise that miners are executing a 51% attack on the network (because that's what's happening when miners mine blocks that a majority consider invalid).
If miners want to 51% attack the network, they have always been able to attack it.  Bad premise.
If instead we start with the premise that Bitcoin is founded on - namely, that 51% of the miners will be "honest miners" not attacking the network but instead seeking to maximize coin value - then your premise doesn't hold.  Honest miners will will never intentionally mine a block that is not accepted by a majority of the network.

I will never convince you and I'm already tired of trying to avoid it.
I say a free banking market will work better than a planned banking system. You will counter that free banking has been tried and failed. I will counter that free banking 200 years ago lacked the near-instantaneous communication of pricing and the free exchange of currency that we have now and so is not comparable. I will further argue that so called free banking was not free but rife with cronyism and state (not federal) money manipulation, so in reality free banking has never existed. I will further argue that free banking instability is not instability resulting from the freedom of markets but rather the inherent instability of FRB which is based on fraud and so can only be stable if a government legitimizes that fraud by insuring it.
I say that limited but 100% predictable money supply is preferable to planned banking because it removes uncertainty from the market, and so prices are more reflective of reality. You will counter by saying that the gold standard already failed. I will counter by saying that the gold standard lacked the transparency of Bitcoin and was in no way a predictable quantity of money; and moreover gold is not weightless, infinitely divisible, or instantaneously transmittable and so is not comparable.
I say that fractional reserve banking is based on fraud, and that no money supply based on FRB can be stable. You will laugh at me because FRB is demonstrably successful. I will counter by saying that, without government insurance, FRB is the cause of the banking instability that occurs in periods where free banking has been tried and failed; but with government insurance, FRB is subject to black swan events that will be more catastrophic than any financial catastrophe we've ever seen.
I'll be totally unable to convince you because my arguments are based on my own conclusions which are not shared by a majority of experts in economics.
Meanwhile you'll be at a loss to explain how economics, which is completely and fundamentally based on the concept that *the price of a thing reflects only the market's value of that thing*, somehow works better when we violate that foundational principle and try to control the price of the most important object in that economy (money) through central planning. If markets work best when prices are allowed to communicate freely throughout the economy, why on earth would we think that the economy would work better if prices are distorted through government interference? It is a logic that makes sense in the context of government-issued fiat currency only (whose value is inextricably tied to the perception of the issuing governments value), but which makes no sense in the presence of a worldwide currency which requires no government or central authority backing.
And so you'll call me a fool or a quack, and ultimately we'll agree to disagree, because I have a graduate degree with lots of economics classes so I'm completely aware that all of my arguments fly in the face of conventional economics, and while I'm OK with that, I suspect you won't be.

I basically have a minor in queuing theory and probabilistic modeling. It doesn't take an actual queuing expert to understand what could happen if a rush to the exits occurred. Bitcoin has had these events before and is likely to have them again, as it is a volatile asset.
But Bitcoin has never experienced a rush to the exits with a massive backlog. And almost nobody alive today has ever studied much less experienced a bank run. So this needs to be discussed with open eyes, because it is a known risk.

Why is this considered "less broken" than a hard fork implementation in which nobody passes along transactions they don't really understand as though they're valid? The whole point of the network is to validate transactions. 
I think soft forks for anything that isn't totally trivial can be toxic to the ecosystem. Just because a feature *can* be implemented in a way that makes it politically easier doesn't mean that's a *proper* way to implement the feature.

I was around for all of the events you mentioned. At the time of those events, Bitcoin's block size limit was much higher than the average run rate of transactions so its impact on the panic sell was negligible.
Bitcoin hasn't had a significant panic in over two years. Since then blocks have filled up. The next panic won't be like the last one.

Because there will likely be hubs that service lots of users. Just like the other poster said wrt 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon. No that's not a non sequitur :)
 If you aren't familiar with why that game works the way it does, it works because Kevin has connections to thousands of other actors by virtue of being in so many different movies. In sociology he's what is called a linking pin role: practically everyone who ever worked in Hollywood has worked with him, or has worked with someone who has worked with him.
Likewise, Lightning hubs that are well funded will be able to establish channels with lots of users. The more funds you have, the more channels you can fund.
LN, like Hollywood movies, evolves into a hub and spoke architecture.

Fungibility is the ability for units of a commodity to be substituted with each other.
This has interesting economic implications for layered solutions like sidechains or payment layers.
For example, suppose I invented a Bitcoin sidechain or payment layer that enables an amazing use for Bitcoin not possible onchain, and it turns out that use is very valuable, but only if your Bitcoin are actually converted for use on the sidechain or payment layer.
This harms Bitcoin fungibility, because the different *states* of Bitcoin behave economically as though they were two *different monies*, even though both "are Bitcoin".
Any additional friction required to convert one form of Bitcoin to another (ie time and cost of conversion) only exacerbates the fungibility problem.

Because it does not require them to pay the entire and direct cost of maintaining a more secure blockchain than they themselves could make on their own. 


You argue that a private blockchain will offer "good enough" security. The answer is that it can, if the assets secured by that blockchain are of trivial value. High value transactions present high value targets to malactors. The cost to prevent their attack is proportional to the cost of the value stored on their private blockchain. This forces participants into the arms race of mining. 
With bitcoin that price is absorbed by the entire market. With a private blockchain it's us V them.

I was also wondering about this.
It seems like an effective strategy for a would-be hub operator would be to unilaterally establish channels with as many people as possible, thereby inserting himself in the "middle" of the emergent hub and spoke architecture.
&lt;tinfoilhat&gt;could this be the purpose of the mysterious dust transactions &amp; of 2014/15? Could these be / be converted into channels? If so, the "center" of the hub and spoke architecture may have already asserted itself&lt;/tinfoilhat&gt;

@_date: 2016-01-11 21:38:16
Yes but the probability of success goes down rapidly over time, as long as most of the network follows FSS then it's not trivial to do in person. You have to have the Bitcoin in the first place in order to double spend them and they might get spent anyway. Might as well just shoplift or walk your coffee bar tab. At least that way you don't accidentally pay for stuff you ostensibly are trying to steal. 
This is my point. In face to face brick and mortar usage, it's probably easier to steal outright than to try zero-conf double-spend attacks.

You can predict using historical data which can give you an estimate with some statistical confidence, but there are problems with the prediction approach.
Prediction works fine if the network is more or less in a steady-state, because future fees are probably similar to recent past fees.
However if there are bursts of transactions that begin to clog the network at the same time as your transaction, and / or if users are using RBF (replace by fee) then there is no real way to predict required fees with any reasonable confidence.
At that point the only way to ensure a transaction processes by some required time with some degree of confidence is to be prepared to bid up your fee using RBF.

There's no need to use Bitcoin for every single coffee purchase.  As far back as the earliest plans for Bitcoin, off-chain solutions were imagined for using Bitcoin in routine day-to-day use, where critical features like censorship resistance and permissionlessness are not needed.
The issue is: it is nearly impossible to tell, *simply from the amount of the transaction*, what was the *purpose* of the transaction - whether the transaction is an unimportant coffee transaction in a civilized part of the world, or a payment for food or medicine in a place where ability to transact over the internet is nearly impossible, and Bitcoin's censorship-resistance and permissionlessness are required.
It is also easy to write off small amounts as "unimportant" when one's daily earnings exceed some people's yearly earnings.

Brain sync no. However for example, I think there is clear widespread community consensus on the value of segwit to the overall network. There's some disagreement on whether a hard or soft fork is the best way to maintain consensus long term and some other implementation details but it seems like a nice clean segwit patch (all the other political issues notwithstanding) would likely achieve decentralized consensus. I have yet to run across anyone who is opposed to Segwit itself.
So I'd be optimistic that improvement would continue if mining is re-decentralized.

What's interesting about this aspect of the situation is that it highlights two things:
1. If decentralized mining hashpower comes to consensus and forks, this guy can file all the lawsuits he wants and it can't change a thing on the blockchain. This is good for "blockchain tech."
2. However that doesn't stop him from bringing suit against the high profile community leadership. It's unlikely that an informed court would uphold the suit, but the attacker can still bring suit, which will cost the leadership time and money and possibly cost the community bad press.

Let me introduce you to a new word:  "Permissionless."  Sorry that was mean, but any winning hard fork becomes by definition the standard of Bitcoin.  If XT reaches 75% and forks, it's the standard.


If one fork produces perceived economic benefit for one group, and another fork produces perceived economic benefit for another group, it would be irrational to expect them to agree.
Edit: I'm not arguing that's necessarily what's happening here, but it certainly will happen as interests inevitably diverge.  I personally see this conflict as one part ego-match / pissing-contest, one part disagreement over possible financial interests, and one part legitimate (unresolved) philosophical disagreement.
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:50:23
I agree with what you're saying but I have an entirely different read.
If the entire economy were to switch to a deflationary currency, like bitcoin, prices would ultimately stabilize, and such massive swings as $1 to $256 wouldn't be such an issue.
It is true that debt would be more expensive in a deflationary world; however, conversely, savings would be more productive.  This would encourage families, for example, to discourage wasteful consumption in lieu of saving money, and to save money to spend primarily on high-quality durable items, like real estate.  "Spending money for the joy of spending money" would become more costly, and people would be slightly inclined to hold, instead of slightly inclined to spend money.
Working families at or near the margin cannot easily access inflation-beating securities.  In a deflationary economy, these people can actually easily store wealth in a way that allows them to access it in the future.
It is true that if people quit taking on debt, and slow their more wasteful spending, and start saving, and the money supply deflates, that this could involve a catastrophic unwinding and collapse of the current debt-based money supply, which depends on ever-increasing levels of debt to be issued.
What is catastrophic to an inflationary, debt-based currency, however, is not at all catastrophic to the deflationary currency.
I think the question is easily answered with a simple test:
I will pay you some amount of wealth using one of two currencies.  Each is exactly the same in every way except one can be expected to lose value over time, while the other can be expected to gain value over time.
Using this simple test, it's easy to see that all other things equal, a deflationary currency will always ultimately win in a market of freely available currencies.

In a nutshell, a shorter confirmation time offers less security than a longer confirmation time, but more shorter confirmations is more secure than fewer longer ones.
Confused?  Imagine there was Bitcoin2, precisely like Bitcoin in every way except it confirms every minute.
Now, a single confirmation in Bitcoin2 isn't worth much, but ten confirmations (ten minutes) is *more* secure than a single, ten minute confirmation on Bitcoin.
This makes a lot of assumptions about global propagation times, etc.. but that's the ELI5.

Please refer back to the [original comment](
I did not say, "Bitcoin is not inflating."
I said, and I continue to argue, "Bitcoin should not be considered the same as an inflationary currency."
The two statements are not equivalent.
You went on to [dispute that Bitcoin's limited supply was priced into current pricing]( I continue to disagree with your position.  *Of course* the fact that one day there won't be any more new bitcoins created causes today's price to be higher than it would otherwise.
This is why [the person I was responding to is correct]( if you're modeling Bitcoin, you see that it behaves like a resource of limited supply being released (price tends up), not like an inflationary currency (price tends down), and therefore one should be careful calling it "inflationary" because that word implies a lot of things that are not true about Bitcoin.
Hope that helps.

There's always another coin I can move my money to, if Bitcoin adopts rules I disagree with.
All rule changes, hard or soft, must be approved by the economic majority.
Edit: I think you're missing my point.  I am aware of what happens when a "soft fork" occurs.  My point, is that this is not a software-rollout issue, it's an economic issue.  Whether a fork is "hard" or "soft" has no bearing - all changes that go counter to the best interests of the economic majority weaken security and threaten to "hard fork" the market cap to a different coin altogether.

I agree with much of what you wrote.  In particular this statement.
We would all do well to remember the value chain here:
investors / speculators / transactors  &gt;&gt; coin value &gt;&gt; mining competition &gt;&gt; security  &gt;&gt; investors / speculators / transactors
Ultimately, we need to choose whatever serves the economic majority here.  That is a combination of security and increased transaction throughput.
I do not believe a case has been made that a change from 1MB to X is *necessarily* a reduction in overall network security.  It depends on many factors, many of which are unknown.  If I'm wrong I stand ready to correct this statement, just supply me with a link to a white paper etc I can read, not a link to a heated, poorly defended internet debate.  I haven't seen such a document but I am excited to read one.
However, what we can say for sure, is that 1MB is a real and present threat to the ability of the network to scale to 2-10X its current size, something that would be required if Bitcoin were to experience another round of significant growth.
Some people argue that transaction throughput has not experienced major increases in the last year or so, so we needn't worry about it.
To this, I argue: to what degree would you be willing to invest in a technology that rides atop a payment layer that isn't capable of making the next-level leap in its own growth rate?
You don't build infrastructure after growth occurs.  You don't build roads and bridges *after* people build their homes.  You don't build docks and piers *after* people show up with boats.  You don't build the Internet *after* people build a bunch a web sites and need somewhere to host them.
An investor with $10M to drop on a big business venture can easily discover that Bitcoin in its current form cannot support the transaction throughput even that venture might require.
The next level of usage demands that Bitcoin be ready to scale up, fast, without choking on its own governance process.  If Bitcoin (the infrastructure) can offer acceptable levels of security, today, with 10X the throughput, today, then it needs to do that, today, or money will just start seeping elsewhere.
*And if money starts seeping elsewhere, you tell me what that does to mining centralization.*

I think you've hit the nail on the head.
At fundamental issue are two groups with different, possibly mutually exclusive stakes.
One group seeks to reduce or constrain block size citing security risks and fundamental lack-of-scalability of the underlying protocol.
The other group seeks to increase block size citing capacity risks and arguing for incremental, "good enough for now" scalability.
The two groups have different architectural visions for Bitcoin.
One group thinks that Bitcoin should be viewed as a settlement layer for a transaction layer that runs on top of it.  "It's more important to secure 100,000 coffee transactions than any one coffee transaction."  Makes sense from a certain architectural point of view, especially if you consider that current Bitcoin tech can't scale as-is to support even the world's coffee sales.
But another group believes that the original peer-to-peer vision of Bitcoin means that it is in fact that "one coffee transaction" - ie the peer-to-peer transfer of value - that is Bitcoin's mission.  Such a viewpoint immediately means that maximizing the throughput of the Bitcoin network, and keeping as much commerce as possible on the Bitcoin blockchain, is the goal.
Where I'm going with this, is that I've watched this debate unfolding, and I think you've hit the nail on the head.  The disagreement is justified, because each group shares its own, defensible, mutually exclusive vision of Bitcoin.
So, TL;DR - doesn't seem like consensus is realistic

There are several things wrong with the analysis but it mostly boils down to this:
The cost to secure the network is justifiable relative to the overall Bitcoin market cap secured by the network; it's just that Bitcoin value is currently driven more by speculation than transaction volume.
If you want to make it more efficient on a per-transaction basis, push more transactions through it.

There isn't an argument to be made and I would suggest not even going there.  There is no reason to offer Luke-jr the power to redefine what it means to be an altcoin.  He can use the same definitions the rest of us use.
[Bitcoin is controlled by consensus](  If a significant majority of users starts using XT, and the blockchain successfully forks to large blocks running on XT, then that is Bitcoin.  The terminating fork is also Bitcoin, it's just the terminating fork of Bitcoin.
[By definition] no alts are created in this process, there are simply the surviving and the terminating forks, both forks of the same Bitcoin blockchain.
If by disaster both chains somehow survive, then *both sides will claim they have the True Bitcoin chain.*  Neither is an alt.
However ^ this?  Won't happen.

But an "inflationary currency" is one in which future supply tends towards infinity, since it grows some % year over year.  That's why Bitcoin can't be thought of like an inflationary currency.
Bitcoin has a fixed supply, which is being released.  The total eventual number is known and fixed, which is priced into the current value of today's coin and upwardly supports its value towards infinity.
Conversely, in an inflationary currency, the eventual number is infinite, and the eventual price is zero, so when you price *that* into today's currency, you *lower* the value towards zero.
Since Bitcoin clearly does not behave in the same way as an inflationary currency, one should be careful calling it "inflationary."

It's obviously not as obvious as you think.
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:28:21


First, *even if* someone wants to actually propose a split of the Bitcoin network into a "good" and "bad" coin, **the ability for any participant to innovate the code is the whole point of a permissionless network** and if you're working against *that* then you are *working against the goals of a permissionless network.*
Secondly, if *literally anyone can change the code*, but changes to that code so easily damage the network, well fuck, the network is a complete house of cards isn't it?  That can't be right, can it?  And if so, then that opens us up to an entirely different discussion...
Thirdly, XT is designed to not create a fork until there exists significant consensus, so it will no more create a "divergent currency" than *any other hardfork*.  IF XT's large-block code kicks in, it's because it's the new Bitcoin.
Lastly, to you and everyone else, get this straight:
**the money, not the devs, decides**
If big money wants to transact on small blocks, then the market cap of the small block chain will be preserved, and you have nothing to fear from any code change.
Conversely, if big money wants to transact on larger blocks, then all the roadblocks in the world won't stop it.  If the market demands it, and Bitcoin won't provide it, some other coin will.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:45:47

People could lie about supporting 1MB and reject blocks over 700KB and that's the exact same problem.   Anyone can run whatever code they want.
Once you assume that a large group of miners are willing to collude to harm the network, all bets are off.  There are a number of ways a group of malicious miners can collude to harm the network, once you accept that such a group exists.  Colluding on the blocksize limit is only one of many attack vectors.

Would restate as:
All decisions about the core software should be based around the ideal of increasing the market cap.
I know that is an Unpopular Opinion Puffin around here, but the problem with not liking the opinion, is that if the money moves away from the coin, then you can kiss your security - and your VC funding - and many of your use cases - goodbye.  Conversely, new money coming into Bitcoin increases competition among miners, increasing security; brings in new VC funding with which to build businesses that *target new use cases*; etc..
Where we agree is that I believe in a majority of the cases, increasing the number of use cases also increases market cap.  However my point remains, that if there exists an alternative that demonstrably hurts / helps Bitcoin's market cap, that should be the barometer.

I get a log of flak around here for my constant comparisons to the early days of networking, but what you describe "it's like creating your own TCP/IP" is how networking got started, you know.
Used to be, when networks were first invented:
1. The primary focus was on INTRANETS not THE INTERNET.  Corporations spent tons of money on all kinds of networking tech, lots of it proprietary, now-obsolete stuff like Token-ring, Novell, Banyan, etc.. Almost all the expenditure went to building *internally-facing networks*, often incompatible, etc..   It was not clear at the time that all the different standards would all be erased and we would all use one network one day.
2. You say the whole idea about the blockchain was trust.  Well the whole idea about the internet was decentralized permissionless sharing of info - but companies took "networking tech" (like "blockchain tech") and built walls of secrecy around all their little proprietary internal networks, and for quite some time, *that was what computer networking was about* for almost everyone working in the field.
3. Then one day, *after* lots of companies all had internal networks, companies started seeing the real value in exchanging information with each other over these networks.  That's when a lot of them realized that Banyan wasn't going to cut it.

Have ensured that the community cannot be stonewalled by any entities who have an interest in preventing change, and for that they should be commended.
If there is no such stonewalling taking place, then Core will easily be able to ensure that it remains the reference client simply by adopting *any* block size limit solution that does not create artificial capacity constraints, before the 1MB limit is exceeded. Simple. Considering that many people think it will be a long time before the limit is exceeded, then Core can take all the time it thinks it has to come up with a better solution. 
If however any individuals or groups were attempting to prevent this change from being realized by vetoing it from Core, well, then it's good that users and miners have a choice. 
There is about a billion dollars in investment in services that are supposed to use the blockchain if they come to fruition. Those devs need reassurance that when all their apps are ready, the bandwidth is there to support them. Otherwise they'll build on some other infrastructure.
Looked at this way you see that a fork only becomes an issue if the userbase demands it but Core refuses to provide it. So it's good that this is no longer a lever that anyone thinks can be used to stymie change.

@_date: 2015-08-13 12:59:35
I'm just trying to understand your hypothetical.
You are describing a hostile attack on the network resulting from your change, not a growth in demand or other "normal" use that suddenly would happen if you forked.
And why would you fork to make block sizes unlimited?  When was that proposed?  Maybe I missed the point of your hypothetical.  I'm not sure any honest miner would choose to have no anti-abuse cap.
@_date: 2015-08-13 12:14:38
Miners are the voters?  Or pool operators?
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:36:02
Exactly. 
To be clear, that vector is an *arbitrarily low block size limit* exacerbated by the very poor way wallets handle default fees.
If wallets responded gracefully to this situation two things would happen :
1. Once the "attack" started, wallets would start raising the suggested fee for users wishing to make transactions. 
2. As the required fee starts immediate floating up, the "attacker" quickly has to raise *his* fees or have his transactions denied. This would make such an attack much more expensive, much more quickly 
Since wallets don't do this by default, and since users have no information with which to decide what fee to pay, almost everybody pays the default fee. Pricing information never makes it from the miners to the users. 
Hopefully this helps explain just how important it is to rapidly get people off of wallets that set a fixed default fee and onto wallets that dynamically calculate a fee based on network conditions and user requirement. If everybody was already using such a wallet, the current attack would be much more expensive, and valid transactions would pretty much all be going through. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:15:05
Two things need to be done. 
One is that wallets need to be able to determine what is the fair TX price.
The other is that the block size limit should be significantly higher. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:27:03


Couldn't agree more.  Very apt description.
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:42:42


So long as some people's interests are better served by one alternative while other's interests are better served by another alternative, change will ultimately involve one group not getting what's in its best interests.
"Consensus" is unlikely to form in this environment.  Waiting for it would be a mistake.
In a situation where there isn't likely to exist a "natural" consensus, a strong majority will need to form, and that majority will need to impose its will on the minority view, before change can occur.
My point is simply: just because you see two groups disagreeing, and each trying to foist its view on the world, does not mean the process has broken down, it just means that discussion and reason alone will not achieve consensus, but instead, action will need to be taken, sides drawn, and a decision forced.  That is the correct process in this situation, ugly though it may seem.
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:31:32
You raise a valid point.
Can we agree that, provided the miner is exploiting his large-block competitive edge *by including 'valid' transactions* (whatever those are), then he is doing so for the overall benefit of the network, by increasing overall transaction throughput / lowering overall transaction cost?
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:05:48
Edited previous comment.  You are correct that I misspoke.  For the record at least one dev has posted here that he thinks the limit should be lower, but doesn't think it's worth trying to lower it, so hopefully miners will self-regulate.

Thanks for keeping it polite!


I think you raise a valid point that Bitcoin does not guarantee that any specific transaction will necessarily be included by the network.
This however isn't quite the same as censorship in my opinion, which would imply that any one entity had the power to keep your transaction off the blockchain.
Clearly, any resource which is limited, cannot be guaranteed to an arbitrarily large group.  But that's not the same thing as censorship, which would be the *forced exclusion* of any arbitrary individual / transaction from participating.
Yours is still a good point to consider when considering the importance of transaction bandwidth in guaranteeing access.

These are all great points!  Another point: the moment the 75% consensus is reached, the value of coins on the 25% network will be arbitraged almost immediately to zero.
That is why, what will happen, is that by the time 50% is surpassed, we will move very quickly to 100% --- nobody, *nobody* wants to start mining a worthless altcoin.

IIRC they've demonstrated a new laser that can transmit ~70Gbps over existing single-fiber-optic cable.
I and hundreds of millions of people have fiber at least as far as "down the street" which means even if multiplexed over 50 homes, that's still better-than-gigabit Internet in each home, using current fiber infrastructure.
It's all a question of demand pull at this point.  If enough money chased that bandwidth, the technology would get productized pretty quickly I would bet.
This is why I think we need to make sure that Bitcoin can support a "gigabit-internet-everywhere" mentality: if sufficient individuals can operate Bitcoin miners / nodes at gigabit speeds or better, then that means we're capable of *faster, larger, and more secure* blocks than current design permits / assumes.

Let's take an example. 
If I want to disrupt Bitcoin through mining centralization, I have to acquire and hold a mining majority. That's very costly. 
Or I can disrupt it by purchasing all the available space on the blockchain. That costs a lot less.
The less space you make available, the easier it is to buy all of it. Reduce the block size limit to 1 TX per block, and the attacker only has to consume that one space to stop all transactions.
True that one space will be expensive, but not as expensive as 10,000 spaces in a larger block. 
All forms of centralization matter. They are all points of failure in a decentralized system.

You're being downvoted but I see this argument time and again.  "Why do you think 8MB or even 20MB is going to solve any real problems, because the Visa network processes 20,000 tps and that would take a 10GB/block chain, and that could never ever work, so we obviously need an entirely different concept."
Perhaps, instead, Bitcoin should just scale out to its maximum capacity, and continue to process as many transactions as demanded for the lowest possible fee, and perhaps given Moore's Law and possible protocol enhancements along the way, the base Bitcoin protocol &amp; network will keep scaling out faster than the adoption rate, and so we don't need an entirely different concept at all.

But [by definition]( an "altcoin" is any coin other than Bitcoin.  And by your own argument, nobody controls the Bitcoin protocol specification, it's a majority-rule.
So by definition, if the majority choose a particular set of consensus rules, then that is Bitcoin, and whatever else, is the altcoin.

Yes, this is where we disagree.  In code these things are possible, but economically, they aren't.  There is no conceivable way XT will reach 74% deployment without pre-existing economic clarity about the outcome of reaching 75%.
The market will be completely galvanized to the change, and will be responding very favorably / unfavorably as we approach "inevitability" of a fork.
IF in fact there is a market stalemate (unlikely) then that simply represents a fundamental truth: there is no clear consensus, just a lot of clear preference for one or the other - OK, then, better to just make two coins, and let the market eventually figure itself out.
Would this be traumatic to Bitcoin?  Sure, but the mistake is blaming the trauma on the process / fork, when the reality is that if this happens, it's because the trauma is due to a lack of clear information, and only through change could we have learned the information we lacked.

More importantly, it simply does not scale.  You might be able to round up the encrypted data (or confiscate the funds) of a person or a handful of people this way, but a million people?  Ten million people?  Can't be done.

This is the most salient point:
"If your concern is about nodes with different configs communicating with eachother, I'd like to reiterate: the idea really is no different than suggesting that someone fork the codebase and implement their own changes, it just cuts out most of the work required."
Lots of devs have pointed out that anyone can fairly easily modify the codebase to accept larger blocks, and in fact, the entire ecosystem is designed to support and enable exactly this sort of "consensus computing."
There is a lot of logic in this proposal.
A blocksize-limit config variable has an extremely useful attribute: it could be modified by an external helper app.  This means that we could:
1. Put the value in the config now
2. In the future, design any number of plug-ins that monitor network conditions and adjusts the limit *based on user requirements*
3. Without modifying Core

This is incorrect.  "Everyone" knew no such thing whatsoever.
Twenty years ago I was one of the very first generations of devs working in the internet / web / intranet space.
The only people who thought it would permeate all aspects of our lives were propellerheads like myself working in the space.  "Everyone" did not race to exploit the internet.  At all.
If it had all been so obvious, the entire internet space would not have been created by freak-show startups like Google, Amazon, and eBay, but by entrenched players with all the capital.
For example, in 1995, for almost any normal person in the street, the idea of sending money to an anonymous guy on the internet (which most people still didn't even have) and expecting him to ship the promised vintage stereo on time in good condition was completely ridiculous.
Everyone I knew, myself included - *and I was an internet evangelist* - thought eBay would completely fail on its premise, and would just be one scam after another.
And frankly, in 1995, most of the easy money to be had on the Internet *was running scams / MLMs and porn sites.*  We always said "porn built the Internet".  A lot of people thought the Internet was super-shady and that legit businesses shouldn't get involved with it.

I see your debate on this topic was quite lengthy. Maybe this will help. 
If you destroy coins, you are "purchasing" the asset by "buying" it from the entire market.
Consider a market of ten people each with one bitcoin (ie there are only ten btc in existence).
If one person destroys his Bitcoin, he has increased the value of the others' Bitcoin by roughly 10%. This one transaction is the equivalent of nine transactions (in which he would send each person some number of btc instead). If there were instead a million participants in the market, this one coin burn would be the equivalent of a million micropayments. 
IOW provable coin burn is actually a very innovative and efficient way to transfer value 1-all.

@_date: 2015-07-08 22:49:53


The network is in no way unusable. 
The problem is that most wallet software just pays a baked in fee. Many users don't know how to change the default (depends on the wallet) and even if they do know how to change it, they have no idea what the fee *should* be to give it priority over spam.
As a result a spammer can pay this default amount or a little more and get priority over many people's transactions. 
I repeat this is a flaw with the wallet implementations. 
If instead, everybody used a wallet that allowed the user to get an estimated fee to "get my transaction into the next X blocks with Y confidence" then as spam increased, the typical fee would immediately float upwards a penny or so. Users would get their transactions processed right away but spammers immediately see their attack cost rise significantly. And no fancy "spam detector" needed. 
TL;DR spam is a wallet implementation problem

Actually, the estimate for "how long until the next block" at any given time is 5 minutes, given no other information.

If all wallets estimated the fee needed to get the transaction into the users desired block at the users desired confidence, then fees would naturally float up as abuse increased.

Bitcoin originally rolled out with no blocksize limit.  A 1MB limit was added subsequently.  The 1MB consensus rule was "incompatible with every other current implementation of the Bitcoin protocol".
Therefore, by your definition, Bitcoin is itself no longer Bitcoin, but already is an altchain, and the "real" Bitcoin chain is possibly still out there, being mined by a lone miner who never updated his original source code.
XT is designed to not fork the chain until substantial consensus exists.  If XT causes a fork, it's because the community effectively selected XT as the new protocol.

You are reporting a confidence of 1.7% as a "match" when in reality it is far below the statistical error rate of your z-test. You are abusing the data to imply correlation when in fact a result of 1.7% confidence does not imply correlation, it implies NO CORRELATION. 
As Mark Twain famously said, there are "Lies, damn lies, and statistics."
I have no idea what the error rate of your test should be, but you say it's 85% accurate.  All that stuff with p= &lt;15? Noise. So you maybe found five accounts.

This isn't exactly what I was saying but I agree nonetheless. 
I'm saying, run a client today that expresses the large block rules you are comfortable with. Don't just run default Core and wait for it to express these rules. Vote now.
If a supermajority wants a higher limit, they can express their will today.
Does this increase certain risks? Yes. However it decreases others. 
In the end if the coin does what the market asks it to, then that expresses itself as higher coin value, which ultimately increases Bitcoin security. Conversely if the coin doesn't follow the market's needs then it will lower in value and ultimately security.

For most users fees are defaults baked into wallet apps. The pricing system for fees in bitcoin is quite broken. 
When you pay for any service, are you required to guess what the price will be? Do you guess the amount needed to pay your electric bill, and hope that you paid enough, or your electricity is turned off?
That's how Bitcoin fees work. There is literally no way for the average user to know the cost of getting his transaction included in the next X blocks.
What we have instead is a default that's baked into the wallets and paid on most TXs, regardless of any market price. So the market cannot find its fair price. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:23:22


I studied operations management in graduate school and practiced it in a wafer fab in another life so its pretty familiar to me ;) try me.


Of course no wallet can guarantee that any transaction can make it into any specific block. But fees can be chosen that meet the users level of urgency without forcing the user to guess at a fee. It's straightforward.
And if every user used a wallet with this ability, then abuse would be kept to its economic minimum.


**Bitcoin has never dropped a transaction?**


There exists a maximum number of transactions that can get pushed through the mining network regardless of block size.
Low priority transactions can wait an infinitely long time in queue if higher priority transactions continue to arrive faster than the system can process them. Eventually they will be flushed. It would be a mistake to hold them in queue indefinitely. 
There is absolutely nothing that can be done to stop that as the system fills. Raising the block size limit is important but it doesn't change the underlying problem:
Modern wallets have absolutely no way to set a fee that will reliably meet their performance needs. Most just offer a default fee.
Fix that problem, fix lots of problems. Particularly spam. 
If all wallets estimated the fee needed to get the transaction into the users desired block at the users desired confidence, then fees would naturally float upward as abuse increased. Users might pay a penny or two more. Their transactions would process with the desired speed. And spammers would immediately pay more with each block they abuse.

Haven't read a spec. But it's the right idea: users should be able to configure the wallet to suggest fees for X% confidence the transaction will appear in the next Y blocks.

The 25% miners will never produce a longer chain.  The coins on the 75% chain will instantly be more valuable than the coins being mined on the shorter chain.
Nobody has an interest in holding coins on the shorter chain, as their value instantly starts dropping after the fork.  Arbitrage will ensure that the value of the "losing" chain's coins will drop very fast.
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:44:06
Wallets need the following type of functionality:
User selects "timeframe" and "importance" in the UI.  The actual UI implementation is completely up to the designer.  An example might be:
Timeframe: [ ] next 20 mins [ ] next X hours [ ] 24 hrs
Priority: [ ] most urgent [ ] urgent [ ] least expensive
Again, the UI elements are totally arbitrary and up to the UX designers.  Perhaps the user enters numerical values for  and  devs, or moves a slider.  I leave that up to the UX guys.
The point is that the user can not only select when they'd like the TX to post, but also how important it is that the TX is on-time.
This allows the software to estimate the least expensive fee required to get the TX into the desired block with the user's desired level of confidence.
This allows the user to tell the wallet:
1. Post this TX into the next block with 99.99% confidence
2. Post this TX today with 95% confidence
3. Post this TX in the next hour or so at the best price
Some people need 99.99% confidence.  Others need 99% confidence or 95% confidence.  Still others are in no hurry and just want the TX to post "soonish".
With the two values (desired block which can be estimated by the user's selection of timeframe) and standard devs (or X% confidence, estimated by the user's input of Priority) the lowest fee can be estimated that is likely to meet the user's desired timeframe X% of the time.
When all wallets start functioning with these types of fee estimators, users will pay lower fees, the fees will rise with market conditions, and spammers will be forced to immediately pay higher fees for abuse.
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:16:42


There are many miners each able to set their own minimum fee. 


Um. Yeah. That's market price. 
 &gt; When the network is congested, and there is no replace-by-fee, there will be a blind auction: no one will know what is the right fee, they would have to guess, the outcome being either waste money or waste time. 
Right. That's bad. The problem is that the client has no information on which to base the fee, so it's very inefficient for the market to arrive at a price. I'm suggesting this is a problem that can /should bé fixed.

This was posted elsewhere but seems relevant here so I'm reposting. 
Bitcoin was intended as a "peer-to-peer" system.
In any true "system of peers", any *sufficiently powerful* "peer" can disrupt the system. It's the nature of the beast. That is what we're seeing today.
You can impose rules, but they just shift the problem around: with a block-size-limit, an attacker just has to figure out a way to stuff blocks / with no block-size-limit, an attacker can make an infinitely large block. It's whack-a-mole. There's probably an optimal limit, but it doesn't solve the problem:
*In any true "system of peers", any sufficiently powerful "peer" can disrupt the system.*
This problem is not going to go away.
What we are seeing now, is that between 2012 and 2015 Bitcoin has become legitimized. Hobbists became speculators and now it's Wall Street.
Bitcoin cannot be stopped. But it can be controlled. With enough money.

@_date: 2015-08-17 13:22:33
Mostly I want to stimulate discussion on the topic at this time. 
Recently it has come to light that the network is quite fragile with respect to forking. Apparently, allowing Bitcoin to be open, such that anyone can write a non conforming client, is a wide-open attack vector.
Perhaps Bitcoin cannot succeed as an open source project after all?
Maybe the private blockchain has merit none of us understood (who until recently believed the blockchain to be resilient to forks)?
I'm sure this isn't a popular opinion but I think all possibilities should be investigated, considering the significant risk of a fork.

Agree 100%
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:17:51
Not sure why you are getting downvoted. 
The block limit prevents one specific attack: a malicious miner creates an *arbitrarily large block*, and forces all other miners to choke while trying to validate it.
However it creates a new attack surface in the process: the *arbitrarily full block*. 
This is why the limit must be set near the theoretical limit of processing / validation: it needs to make sure that most miners (not all) can digest the incoming block while at the same time minimizing the attack surface presented by imposing the limit in the first place.

Why doesn't the government come after your gold, diamonds, guns, and cash in your safe? The same rubber hose techniques that would work for Bitcoin will work even better for any of these other items.
Bitcoins are actually safer since they can only be confiscated by torturing you while valuable physical objects can simply be taken from you without even needing to torture you.
Apparently the government has always been able to beat the wealth out of anyone they want without recourse. I wonder why thus doesn't happen more often? 
(And if you are talking about those cases where this does actually happen, well here we can agree to hate some of the things governments do, but I'm grateful for all the reasons governments can't easily torture at will

@_date: 2015-07-09 16:39:23


There is no limit or algorithm that can stop that. The optimum is reached by driving the market to accurately and swiftly price fees, *so that the economic disincentive to abuse is always maximized*. 
Abuse is subjective. Code is objective. Anyone willing to pay fair market price to ride the train deserves a seat on it.
Your micropayment / email example is wrong in three key regards Mike.
First with email there is a vast blob of content that can be inspected for context to determine if it's "spammy". With transactions there is almost zero context. One man's spam is another man's app.
Secondly with micropayments it isn't grandma who faces high costs. It is spammers. Grandma only sends one email, not 100,000,000.
Also *email spam is filtered by the client not the protocol.* Extending the analogy to Bitcoin: it's a wallet problem. 


Can't be done in any regime that allows dynamic reprioritization. It's an oxymoron. 


I think this is *very, very, very* undesirable, unnecessary, and high overhead behaviour. Mostly it's painfully unnecessary.
It is not possible to guarantee a place in any queue that allows people to pay for priority. As long as someone else can outbid you for your place, there are no guarantees. So stop trying. 
It is however quite possible to offer a window of confidence to users. "Based on current network load I, your wallet, can offer you X level of confidence of getting into block Y" where the user selected values for X and Y. It's doable and relatively simple and wallets are already moving this way.
The good news is that this is easy and sufficient to drive down spam to its economic minimum. The bad news is that we aren't driving this change into the ecosystem and it doesn't seem like devs such as yourself really grasp the significance.

@_date: 2015-07-08 13:00:26


Mea culpa. I know it was added but I don't know how it works. What confidence interval does it assume?
My instinct is that if users can't select a confidence interval in some manner, it's not really very useful. A person who wants a 95% chance of being in the next block has a *very* different requirement than someone who wants a 99.99% chance of being in the next block. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:52:18
The counterargument to *that* is that regardless of Bitcoin, *crypto* is here to stay.  So it makes sense to have a crypto portfolio.  Thing is, at this moment, [Bitcoin is the 800-lb gorilla in the crypto market]( so for most people, it's the only one they should be holding.
But, the good news is that once you hold crypto, it can be effortlessly converted from one form of coin to another.  If some other coin starts looking promising, its easy to rebalance your Bitcoin into a blend of Bitcoin and alts.
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:50:35


It is unnecessary.
Wallets can predict the fee needed to get a transaction into block X with confidence Y. The fact that they do not is a deficiency that is being addressed.
This is a much better way to handle the situation IMO. The transaction works the first time with no additional strain on the network. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:06:22
Of course, reaching a supermajority consensus on a concept prior to implementation is preferable to a shootout at the OK Corral between different special interest groups. 
However, should certain interest groups decide that it is in their best interest to *derail the consensus process*, the majority holds both the power and the responsibility to implement change irrespective of special interest groups.
Therefore these special interest groups would do well to carefully consider the possible repercussions of trying to derail a process that they ultimately do not control. 
The market's will, will be met, either by changing Bitcoin to meet market requirements, or by the market abandoning Bitcoin for a coin of superior quality.
Fortunately Bitcoin users have the power to express their will by choosing to run software that best represents their wishes.

Median values are actual a terrible idea, if I understand correctly. It means that there is roughly a 50% chance that your fee will be insufficient to get your transaction into the desired block.

The money is debt based fiat. By definition, that means that every "dollar" in existence today must be repaid by a "dollar" *plus interest* tomorrow, to whomever financed the creation of your "dollar" today. 
This requires the economy to constantly expand in order to absorb the ever increasing amount of base money, else inflation.
A constantly expanding economy may or may not be desirable or sustainable.
When you say "the government has the power to print money", all you are saying is "the government has the power to issue debt", because the money is a debt instrument. In other words, governments print money by borrowing it.

It would be more like an auction if users had any guidance whatsoever what price they should change the fee to.
Since it's a complete shot in the dark with no data available, the only guidance the user has is the default fee built into wallets. That's why I suggest it's like a price ceiling, because IRL it functions that way. 
Users need wallets that predict the needed fee to be included in a given block.

That right there is everything wrong with Keynesian economics in a nutshell.  It's economics devoid of human behavior.
It's like, without inflation, we'll just quit building houses, quit eating food, quit driving cars, quit living entirely -- we won't need or want to do any of those things -- just hoard and hoard and hoard our money.
The world is full of deflationary assets that people hold - gold, Apple stock, homes - why aren't these hoarded to the exclusion of everything else?
The entire argument against deflationary currency rests on this one faulty assumption regarding people's behavior.

I did answer the question. With a higher block size limit, the network will handle this attack more gracefully. 
Now you are asking a new question, and I disagree with the premise. 
There exists no way of knowing a valid from an invalid transaction. What you call spam someone else may call a valid use of the network. 
In the end anyone willing to buy a ticket gets a seat on the blockchain.
If fees are below fair market value then there exists an incentive to buy them up, driving up the prices on the remaining seats. The default TX fee is artifically low.
One way this can become worse, is if the capacity is artifically constrained. The block size limit artificially constrains bandwidth. 
If you artificially set a low TX fee and at the same time artificially limit capacity, you *must* distort the market for space on the blockchain, and the result is what you perceive is "malicious". But it isn't. It's a direct market result of centralized fee setting running into centralized capacity limitation.

I see this repeated often, but disagree.
Higher coin value means two things:
1. Greater coin utility.  To move $1M requires purchasing ~10% of the entire money supply if Bitcoin is $1 but only .1% if the price is $100.  More valuable coins means Bitcoin is capable of serving a larger economy.
2. Greater network security incentives.  Miners are paid in Bitcoin for each block they find.  It is the incentive to find blocks and earn the block reward (and fees) that keeps Bitcoin secure.  The more valuable the coin, the more competition, and thus security.

No, technically, they send you a bill and you pay it. 
If it worked like bitcoin, you'd send them a payment at the beginning of the month hoping you bid enough for that month's power. If you guessed too low you'd have to wait a month with no power and try for electricity next month. 
Works out great for electric power sellers though, since the only way to ensure you get power is to significantly overpay for the service.

You look back at the most recent N blocks and it's a very straightforward statistical calculation.
What am I missing? 
Edit: If your point is that people pay such wildly varying fees that any statistical calculation is too full of noise to be very reliable - well that's the whole point of making this sort of calculation the default behavior.
If this was default behavior, fees would converge quickly on a fair market value

It should be noted that it is technically possible to keep transactions below a certain fee to *never* post, for at least as long as someone is willing to pay to keep those transactions from posting.
There is no way to "guarantee" any TX will post.  All we can say is that in the past N blocks, X% of transactions above fee Y posted.  Fortunately with this information alone we can make a good estimate.
Good estimation is needed to allow the user to pay the least feasible fee that will actually ever post *with a particular level of confidence.*
The problem with implementations like estimatefee RPC in Bitcoin Core is (as I understand this RPC) that this estimate is only a mean (or median) fee calculation.  That means that if you take the estimate, then roughly 50% of the time, it won't post in that timeframe (that's what a "mean" means).
That's why it's critical that the estimation also include a user selectable confidence factor.  Maybe default is something like 2SD (2 standard deviations) and the user can select higher or lower via slider?  Again, UX guys need to make this an intuitive selection for the estimator.

First off, realize that in a consensus system, anyone can run any code they want.  You cannot "force" 100% consensus.  So there will ALWAYS be a "second coin" created in the event of a hard fork.
You need to set aside the technical stuff, which tells you that the two softwares existing simultaneously is bad.
Instead you need to put on your economist hat, and game out what happens when 75% is reached and the fork occurs and two coins now exist.  That is inevitable.
The issue is: where does the "economic majority" herd go?
When there is a hard fork with a clear majority built in (ie 75% requirement) then that means that the minority coin is a dead-end.  People are welcome to mine it, and trade on it, but the coins on it will rapidly devalue.  
There's no way to "kill it."  People are welcome to keep mining it for the rest of their lives.
But rational people, won't.
So don't panic, and have a nice day!

Ah, so not just anyone would find it trivial to beat the Bitcoin out of someone.  Now we're getting somewhere.
Obviously not just anyone will perform this service.  Also, any number of things might go wrong, like the attacker might get arrested, killed, or beaten up instead by the would-be victim.  Or maybe the victim doesn't give up the Bitcoin, the attacker has to kill them, now the attacker and his agent are both murderers.
So it turns out, then, that hiring hit-men to track individuals and steal their well-protected money by physically torturing it out of them is not something that just anyone can do, and for those people sick enough to be able to do it, is still quite risky.  **Which is why, even though lots of people keep lots of highly valuable objects in their homes any of which can also be stolen through torture, this almost never, ever, ever happens.**
Moreover, there is a real limit to the number of these sort of thugs that can be deployed.  Perhaps getting a few people's Bitcoin by this approach is feasible, but a thousand peoples Bitcoin?  A nation's Bitcoin?  Fuhgeddaboudit.

RBF is actually a dumb feature.  It's a band-aid solution to the problem of not including the right fee to begin with, and requires additional interaction with the network to modify the fee, and thus is wasteful.

This right here is why I made the PSA!  Great question, this belongs at the top.
If you installed Bitcoin Core like normal and sent Bitcoin to a wallet on it, and didn't do anything else, then unless I'm missing some other step that you did, your private key can be leaked to any spyware or malware that your computer contacts, or anyone else who uses your computer, or any computers on your local network with access to your computer.
In other words, without knowing more, I can't say for sure how safe your Bitcoin are, but what you just said sends up big red warning flags.
This also means, if you're running a relay or fullnode, then that node should not be your wallet for storing funds.  Conversely, do not use your wallet that you use for storing funds, and turn it into a fullnode - you're liable to get your Bitcoin stolen.

I agree with you 100% about double-spends and the many problems created by RBF.
All the talk about double-spends misses an incredibly salient point that you bring up: face-to-face transactions have precisely the same risk of fraud with Bitcoin as with credit cards and other forms of payment.  Meaning - if you're running a pawn shop or other high-risk business, you probably want confirmations, but if you're running a grocery store or coffee shop, you probably don't need confirmations.
To pull off a fraudulent face-to-face Bitcoin spend requires the same level of risk as stolen credit cards or counterfeit cash - the thief is visible, has to communicate with the vendor, is probably on camera, and is therefore quite identifiable.  Anyone making the rounds ripping off local Bitcoin merchants is going to get caught sooner or later - thieves have better ways to try to scam / steal.

Datacenter-level operations aren't some new prediction, and they're a red herring to boot.  A lot of people can run very robust nodes on modest hardware with good home internet connections.  Even if a node cost $2000 and the required connectivity cost $100/mo, that's still a bar that millions and millions of people can afford to clear.
The network doesn't need everyone to be a node, it needs a certain threshold, and that's sufficient.  As long as there are "sufficient" nodes, then anyone can use Bitcoin with little chance of censorship.  The trick to having enough nodes, is to ensure that as many people and businesses are using Bitcoin as possible, not cost minimization.

Alice opens a channel with Bob by locking 1 btc into it.  Creating a channel is an onchain transaction, with an expiration date.  If no updates are made, it will expire, giving Alice back her coins.
Bob performs some services for Alice.  Alice and Bob update their multisig to indicate that some of the locked Bitcoin now belong to Bob.  This goes on for a while.  Note that as far as the rest of the world is concerned, these transactions haven't taken place: they exist only on Alice and Bob's computers.
If Bob and Alice get simultaneously struck by a wave of African mononucleosis that leaves them bed-ridden during the channel's expiration period, without either of them closing the channel, then Alice gets her Bitcoin back.
That's what I mean by:


In this case, only Bob has to get hit with African mononucleosis, as Alice can just do nothing and wait for the channel to time out.

Agree totally. Since hashrate is a long term function of coin price, and since coin price spiked early due to speculation, the network built hashpower well in excess of the economic load. There's every reason to think it's excessive for current levels of activity.
Of course that just implies that the hashpower arrived to the party early. It doesn't imply we shouldn't still plan on growing into it.
OTOH the network makes no promises that it will pay for you to mine. If mining becomes unprofitable, miners should leave.

And I was responding that the difference is mostly semantic.
Governments don't actually print money, you know.  When you say "print money" what you mean is "take a loan".  And if a government exceeds its ability to take new loans, by becoming a credit risk, then it can no longer print money sustainably.  I don't consider hyperinflation an "out".
When I say "a constantly expanding economy" I mean taxable GDP must grow year over year, or the system cannot sustain itself.
A debt based money supply is extremely robust with regard to inflation (if the economy expands, its easy to "create new money" (sell new debt), because you're making promises based on an *expanding* economy).  
However: a debt-based money supply is quite fragile with respect to deflation (because you must repay debt on the back of a *shrinking* economy and an increasingly valuable currency).

No, censorship resistance just means that their are enough other people being their own banks that there is always *someone* to serve your transactions without censorship.
The idea that each user *must* also be a bank is erroneous.  We don't need 1 user = 1 node to guarantee censorship resistance, and in fact, such a network would have far too many nodes to efficiently relay transactions.

I think we're both saying similar things.
Let's say you want to pay me for work.  So we open a lightning channel and you lock a certain amount of bitcoin in it.  As I work, you'll pay me using Lightning transactions.
When we open the channel, we both sign a Bitcoin transaction that locks these funds up, with some terms and conditions.  *Creating the channel,* is an onchain, confirmed transaction.  Note that no Bitcoin have changed hands yet.  If the channel closes or times out, you'll get your Bitcoins back.
Now I perform some work, and you pay me through the channel.  To do this, we update the contract that says that all the Bitcoin are yours, and change it so that some of them are now mine.   That is a "Lightning Transaction."
This Lightning transaction exists only on your machine and my machine (and whereever we may have backed it up to).  It "is a Bitcoin transaction" on a plumbing level, but it is zero-conf - in fact, it hasn't even been broadcast to the P2P network yet.
So I do more work, and you pay me again with another Lightning transaction.  Here we both update our multisig transaction, indicating that now, a little more of the Bitcoin are mine.
Again, the state of these transactions is "unbroadcast, zero-conf".
Note that from the point of view of the blockchain, the Bitcoin exist only in a multisig contract.  The blockchain doesn't know that you owe me Bitcoins.  If that contract expires before we publish the state of our transactions, then you'll get your Bitcoins back.

Yes, datacenter-level operations *are* quite easy to run.  There are thousands of datacenters around the world that offer VPS hosting so that you could run a high-availability, high-throughput node very inexpensively.
And small businesses will find that even a moderate machine will scale up to very high throughput.  HDD space is $30/TB - this makes blockchain storage trivial for anyone with enough Bitcoin to be worth securing.
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:22:59
Why do you say that?  In LN, signed, unbroadcast transactions are being held as a medium of exchange.  There is always the possibility that the L2 might fail or experience some vulnerability, such that everyone wants to close all their channels suddenly.  Obviously, not everyone can make an onchain transaction instantly, so people could be "trapped" with their Bitcoin locked in LN channels that cannot close.
Bitcoin "inside" that network are worth less than Bitcoin "outside" of it.
The converse holds as well.  If suddenly some new amazing application of Bitcoin were found, that everyone "had to have" but it could only be utilized by making an LN transaction, then everyone would want to onboard LN all at once.  Obviously, only three people every second, max, can move their onchain Bitcoin into LN channels all at once.  Bitcoin outside the system are now worth less than Bitcoin inside the system.
Since the bottleneck of onboarding / offboarding is very narrow (only 3 tps wide), if there are rushes in/out of the system, the queues could become very long.
We can see that the ability of Bitcoin to process onchain transactions quickly is key to the fungibility of Bitcoin locked in LN channels
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:25:16
You speak as if these are unrelated.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding you.
Adoption drives price, price drives investment in hashpower, 51% of total network hashpower investment = cost to overwhelm the network.  So the more people use Bitcoin, the more investment there is in mining, and the greater the cost to acquire 51% of hashpower, the harder to attack the network.
Bitcoin was least secure when it was least adopted and blocks were smallest.
Security depends on adoption and price support.

Before your argue that this is very unlikely I must point out that it's a lot harder to double spend a zero-conf in a decentralized mining environment than it is to poke one machine off the Internet.
Moreover. We are told zero-conf is too insecure to use for coffee purchases, when only $5 is on the line, but a "coffee purchase payment channel" is worth maybe $50 to attack.

No, they say, "a Lightning transaction is a Bitcoin transaction." This is enough to make uncritical people accept it as equivalent to an onchain transaction.
A Lightning transaction exists as a zero-conf Bitcoin transaction. Not only that, it exists as a zero-conf that hasn't even been shared around the P2P network. Nobody knows about the transaction except the payor and payee.
Now lets add LN relaying. If Bob pays Alice by routing a transaction through Charlie and Dave pays Eric by routing a transaction through Frank and Frank pays George by routing through Alice and George pays Henry by routing through Bob and Bob then pays Henry something and then Frank routes a payment to George through Henry. Etc
Let's say that this goes on for long enough that everyone has more or less routed transactions through everyone else,  creating the state where *everyone's transactions depend on everyone else in order to settle.*
First off let's stop and recap what this means: the blockchain is no longer authoritative. It used to be that anyone could pick up a copy of the blockchain and determine the state of the whole network. Now that's impossible.
Worse: the authoritative state of the network is being stored only on the machines of the people performing the transactions, in live hot wallets, in unbroadcast, unconfirmed transactions. That doesn't pass my smell test. 
Worst it means: since the state of the network is split out among all its participants in such a way that each of them has a piece that is necessary to reconstruct the whole, *a successful attack on any individual is a successful attack on the entire ledger.*

Any other device anywhere in the world can be used for validation.
There are 6000 nodes that will verify your transaction is on the blockchain. Your phone can find *all* of them if you need it to confirm that everyone agrees that your funds were transacted. 
I'm not saying this is even necessary, because it isn't necessary whatsoever, but it shows that you can achieve the exact same level of transaction validation with or without your own full node.

Any predefined limit will automatically create a division.  It's inevitable, because these limits are unfortunately "win-lose".  Even a floating limit creates reason to argue about the limit.  
Some people have even argued that the limit never should have been a consensus variable in the first place. When you realize it isn't something that everyone can agree on in the first place (like 10 min blocks or 21 M coin cap) an interesting argument can be made for its removal, as there has been argument on it since 2010 and it's clear this cannot end so long as a fixed or floating limit is in place.
Edit: We should call it a "division variable" instead of a "consensus variable" /joke

@_date: 2016-02-25 19:20:19


That is in fact precisely what I'm arguing.
The blockchain provides a frame of reference that is authoritative and shared amongst all participants.  When you move the transaction layer to Lightning, and presume "all" transactions are going to happen there (Visa levels), then *nobody* knows the network state, except for what's settled.
And the unsettled part, to me, seems very ephemeral.  At least with broadcast zero-confs (too risky to use for coffee /s), once the transaction makes it on the network, as long as I pay a fee that's higher than the price to mine the transaction, I can pretty much forget about it like a note in the ocean, and trust the network to process it.  It's pretty robust.  With Lightning, the transaction is kept between me and the other end of hte payment channel.  If one or both of us go offline, the valid state of the transaction can get lost.

Lightning does not scale up onchain transactions. Lightning scales off-chain transactions.
There is no direct substitute for an onchain transaction.
@_date: 2016-02-26 13:24:21


You miss the point of the criticism then.
If Alice is a customer and Bob is a hardware store, neither of them has an incentive to lock funds in order to back a currency with which to exchange value. The "economic disincentive to locking up large amounts of Bitcoin" is felt by regular transactors making normal transactions. 
However if Charlie already has a very large stash of Bitcoin, he can decide to use it to fund a hub. With Charlie in the picture, neither Alice nor Bob have to put up a lot of Bitcoin. Charlie can fund the channel, and collect fees.
So instead of P2P financial transactions, there's a third party:
1. The person doing the purchases 
2. The person doing the selling 
3. The person providing liquidity 
This only applies when discussing Lightning in the context of "scaling Bitcoin." Lightning in the context of micropayments can still work P2P but doesn't really help the scaling problem.

A private blockchain must be protected by standard "ring of trust" security and is therefore vulnerable to hackers like any other system.

Right. So...
Increasing the block size limit will almost certainly allow more spam on the network. 
However it will also simultaneously lower the impact of that spam on other users. 
If the purpose of the spam is to keep blocks full for some particular reason, then increasing the size of the block makes the attack significantly more expensive. 
Nothing can "solve" spam. Spam can only be driven down to its economic minimum. The way to do that is multifold. Increasing the block size helps because the limit creates market-distorting artificial scarcity. Dynamic fees are another.
The block size limit increase is not controversial. Almost everyone - surely a supermajority - agrees that the limit should be increased. The debate is how much to increase it.

You should study the code, because you are misinformed about how Bitcoin works.  Bitcoin always follows the chain used by the majority of users (miners and nodes).
If it didn't, Bitcoin would break every time there is an orphan, which happens frequently.  Fortunately, if your client produces or follows a fork that turns out to be in the minority, it will discover this error and start re-following the majority chain.
That is, unless the fork occurs because of a change in consensus rules, and you're following the minority (deprecated) consensus rules.  In that case, the code simply removes you from the network.  You can continue to use the old client on the old fork, but you will discover it to be a ghost town, with no transactions, and no blocks being mined.
That's how the code works.

Thanks for proving my point! 
From the linked article: "In fact, safe deposit boxes held by individuals were not forcibly searched or seized under the order and the few prosecutions that occurred in the 1930s for gold "hoarding" were executed under different statutes."
All the cases of the government going door to door and beating gold out of citizens seem to have been conveniently overlooked by the editors of that Wiki.

@_date: 2015-07-23 12:15:14
There are two reasons this will not happen.
1. the fork ONLY occurs once 75% consensus is reached.  That means that the first large block *will be* on the majority chain and that the minority miners will never produce a longer chain.
2. because of  it means that minority coins will be quickly arbitraged to zero.
3. because of  and  taken together, it means that once 50% is clearly passed, all miners paying attention will rapidly switch.  Nobody has an incentive to mine the dying chain.

You are incorrect in your conclusion, in my estimation. 
Assume that blocks are 1MB and fees are 10 cents per Kb of payload. There are 800 kb of "valid" transactions in the block already. For an attacker to fill the block, he needs to spend 10 cents x 200 Kb = $20.
Now let's assume blocks are 10 MB and let's assume fees are 1 cent. There are still 800 Kb of valid transactions. To fill the block, the attacker has to spend 1 cent x 9200 Kb = $92. And that's assuming fees drop tenfold. 
For your argument to hold, fees would have to drop by a factor of 30 or 40x.
Is that your understanding as well?
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:54:26
Ok let's start over. 
You want to submit a transaction. You need it to be included in the next 2 blocks with high probability. 
How do miners communicate this price to you? They can't. How do you determine this price? You can't. That's a broken market. Prices cannot move to their equilibrium because the necessary market communication is not happening. 
I can think of no other market in which the users of a scarce resource are required to a simply guess how much money to throw at the allocator of that resource and just hope it's enough. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:00:18


Well, now you're describing a different coin. Bitcoin by design uses inflation to pay the costs of building out the mining network and transaction processing. This will be the case for many more years.
Once Bitcoin stops inflating, then the purpose of fees will be exactly what you say. And also a means of discouraging spam.

This.  As an early adopter of e-mail pre-widespread use of Internet (1984) and later on internet-connected email systems (1986) I was able to visualize that email would take over global communication.
What was surprising to me was that it took twenty years to truly do so.  From where I saw things, people would want to learn about the future and early-adopt it, if only for the leg-up it would offer on others struggling with the learning curve of tech change.
I can assure you that my certainty in 1985 that email / networked computers were the future was met with eyebrow-raised amusement by pretty much everyone that wasn't a propellerhead-class techie.  FFS in 1985 a teacher flunked me for using a word processor: "in college you will have to use a typewriter."
In 1985 computers were about as widely adopted as smartwatches today - ie, non-ubiquitous.  Someone had to product-ize the use case of email and connectivity, and entry-friction had to come way down.  That in and of itself took a decade or longer.
Anyway, point is: *you* understand what bitcoin and blockchains enable, so *you* can conceive of the opportunities for disruption this opens up.  The fact that *others* do not understand what these technologies enable, has little bearing on the likelihood of disruption, or the likely level of change.  Genies cannot be rebottled.
What it may impact, however, is speed of adoption.

The same way you protect a "private blockchain" - with public / private key encryption / access issued by a central authority + traditional "perimeter security" app protection.
Private blockchains must be secured by traditional means since access must be controlled perforce by a central authority (else, it woudn't be private, would it?).  Since there is no open market for mining, participants must trust that no other participant is accumulating enough hashpower / stake to alter transactions or impose censorship.  As such private blockchains offer a reduced set of the sort of benefits one would expect from a "public" blockchain.
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:26:09
You are saying that, regardless of the numbers and kinds of transactions that occur on the network, or how they're routed, that each entity can detach from the network independently without affecting the state of the network.
But IIRC there are attack vectors that can cause the network to be unable to correctly assign value, for example if both parties to the channel die and neither ever issue the transactions they're holding.  From the point of view of the blockchain, nothing's transpired, the contract times out.  So the original contract's default-terms should be enacted.  Ie Alice gets all her coins back.  Maybe I'm wrong about that.
If I'm right, then the state-information that's embedded into Alice-and-Bobs payment channel gets corrupted, which corrupts the network state.
I'm probably wrong, but I don't see why :)

True. But what should a user set the fee to be instead? The problem is, the default fee is the only piece of price information any typical user has. 


This is like going to get a train ticket where there is no stated price, so you just pay what you think is a fair price for a ticket based on what other people said they pay, because you have no other information to go on. 
Then on the platform you discover your price was too low, and you can't get on the train. You have to get in line again, guess the price again, and hope that this time, you paid enough. 


Yes, eventually through trial and error, you can figure out how much your ride on the train will cost. But surely you must see that this is not an efficient means of price discovery.

You say that as though there exists a decentralized Lightning Network that we can observe and witness, "see, the network formed a decentralized topology."
Lightning is a technology that produces an emergent network architecture, just like the original Satoshi client produced its own unique emergent network.  Note the definition of [emergence](


That means that just because the network is made out of P2P building blocks doesn't mean it necessarily turns out decentralized.
We have never seen the topology of the network that will emerge from Lightning, as it has not been demonstrated.
However it is obvious from the design that, at least in order to scale up regular coffee transactions, Lightning will take on a hub-and-spoke architecture, in which the wealthiest hubs can enable the most efficient (fewest hop) transactions.  There is a natural incentive for all participants to seek a payment channel with the wealthiest hub, as this hub will provide everyone with cheaper transactions.  While there are countervailing forces to this centralization, this is the fundamental value proposition of LN, so that all other things equal, the emergent network will seek this shape.
So I say that while Lightning may be peer-to-peer at the plumbing level, the emergent network is quite likely to highly centralize.

Bitcoin allows you to "be your own bank."  That's the point!  This does place the onus on the user to protect whatever funds are being banked with *reasonable* security.  Emphasis on reasonable.
If you only ever hold some small insignificant percentage of your wealth in Bitcoin - say, for changetipping people a beer or two - then it may not be a big deal if your Bitcoin get lost or stolen.  In that case, keeping your Bitcoin in an online wallet or even on a payments platform like Changetip or Circle may be fine.  These generally work great for this purpose and are improving all the time.
But if you need to be your own *bank*, it's important to remember that if losing your Bitcoin will *hurt you*, then those Bitcoin should be stored in an *offline* wallet.
The ability of bots, malware, and acts of deviant tomfoolery to acquire ostensibly "secure" information from connected computers is legendary.
In general, you shouldn't keep any amount in an online wallet, or a wallet whose keys you do not control, that you are afraid to lose.  But for small amounts, these kinds of solutions work great, and pose little risk.  
It's all about understanding and managing risk.

I think keeping a block size limit in place because some government might one day block mining is absurd.
Miners in other countries will always have a strong advantage over miners running behind TOR.
If miners can't mine 8MB blocks over TOR, and their government blocks mining, then mining will move to other nations.

How does that get us to the promised land of Visa-level scaling?  Serious question.  I agree that Lightning works for microtransactions.  I just disagree that microtransactions are the lions share of the present or future economy.
A "microtransaction" is just a transaction that technology enables today, that was too inefficient yesterday.  Technology will enable more and more of these over time by lowering the cost-per-transaction, but how does that solve even coffee purchases, much less the everyday exchanges of even larger value?  Coffee purchases have been efficient for a long time now, do we consider them "micro" transactions?
When I think of a "micro" transaction, I think of paying $0.001 to skip an ad, not $7.50 for a cappucino and a small sandwich.  Are we on the same wavelength?

In order to achieve a 10x scaling factor versus onchain, you must lock up 20x the purchase price, or $100, in a channel that you can only realistically use for coffee.  But that's a month worth of coffees. If you can only lock up $25 (a weeks worth) then Lightning can only scale Bitcoin by a factor of 2.5 (from five to two on chain transactions). That can't get us anywhere near visa. 
And that's just coffee. What about lunches? You like to eat at ten different places near you and lunch is $10. To get a 10x scaling factor, you'll need to lock up $2000 - $200 with each of them. 
So you're already out $2100 and all you did was make it a little cheaper to send some transactions.
That's not realistic at all and even if it was, isn't worth the 10x scaling you might get. 
Of course you could take all the $2100 and put it in a single channel (with a hub that most other people use) and then the same $2100 can be used to make coffee payments, lunch payments, or even bill payments. Problem solved. All we need is someone with a large hoard of Bitcoin to be a hub, and then all of us can have one hop payments without having to lock up silly amounts of money with merchants. 
Since only one on chain transaction is needed (as opposed to 2X every merchant) the scaling factor is much higher. 
That's why, if you want to use Lightning to scale Bitcoin, it will produce hubs.

You are mistaken if you think you need a full node to do that.
You don't have an SMTP server on your phone, but you could. 
Edit: and you didn't answer the question. I thought Bitcoin isn't for payments but only for settlement. Normal consumers don't use settlement networks. Only liquidity providers need settlements. You're telling me that liquidity providers are going to use *phones* to run a settlement network. It doesn't make sense.
Maybe you can walk me fully through a use case so I can understand you.

They have the knowledge and the incentives.
They lack the spine.
We know when the economy is doing well, and we know when tax revenues start going up.  When this happens, spending should be cut.
But politicians cannot abide a surplus.  The only game they know is spending ever more money.
Can anyone point to a modern first world economy that has successfully maintained a "true Keynesian" budget - one that on average over the course of 10-20 years is balanced?  Has it *ever* happened?
I doubt it - but if so, I'm earnestly curious what sort of governance structure is in place in that economy, because I don't think any representative government will ever possess this sort of intestinal fortitude.
I worked in a very large multinational business that was able to do this.   They called it "countercyclical investing" and they only spent money on new plant, property, and equipment when they saw demand falling.  However, it was led at the top.  Middle managers *always* want more money to grow "their part" of the business (to make their part, and thus themselves, more important / powerful).  The CEO directed countercyclical investment.
By analogy, in the USA, this would mean that the President would be frequently shutting down the government -- when times were good, no less!
Political suicide.

No. If the blockchain is used to move multi-billion dollar transactions but the coin used to secure the network is worthless, then the transactions on the network are not secure.
The cost to attack the network is a function of the price of the coin used to secure it. You can't place anything on the blockchain worth more than the cost of an attack or it will become worthwhile to try to steal it.

Here's the problem with your argument. 
Let's say I place a contract on the blockchain that gives me ownership of a piece of property worth one billion dollars.
This immediately creates an incentive to disrupt that blockchain to modify that contract giving ownership to a thief.
The thief is therefore willing to spend up to one billion dollars to amass a mining network capable of performing 51% attacks.
In your hypothetical blockchain with a worthless coin, there is insufficient incentive to protect against this attack. 
Blockchain security is proportional to coin value. A blockchain secured by worthless coins will be successfully attacked if objects of value are stored on it.

This is the most cogent, simple answer I've yet read to the question, "why is Bitcoin's adoption rate slower than that of other tech?"

According to your link, an investor only becomes a hoarder after they have accumulated so much of the asset that their continued purchases push up the price.

So you and Satoshi and a few dozen other people and institutions possess enough Bitcoin to actually move the price.
You are one of the very few people for whom the word "hoarder" actually applies.
If you can dump all your Bitcoin on an exchange with a single market sell order without significantly moving the price, you aren't hoarding. At least not successfully.

I agree that Bitcoin and its blockchain can work if Bitcoin is used as a store of value and not as an everyday currency.
However. 
Once Bitcoin is generally accepted as a useful value store, the incentive to improve the transaction rate will be overwhelming. Good suggestions are already on the table that could provide many orders of magnitude more transactions per second than currently possible, even rivaling the Visa network.
So the transition from value store to currency seems inevitable, at least to me.

Executives, not subject matter experts, make the purchasing decisions and CIOs will all soon be expected to have a "blockchain answer" when shareholders want to know "what is company XYZ doing to profit from this new blockchain technology I keep hearing about."
Just being able to insert a buzzword into an earnings report can pump stock price. All you need to do is appear to have a business plan. It makes no difference if there is anything actually actionable.

What coins? Not Bitcoin. 
A Bitcoin requires a bitcoin transaction in order to possess it. 
At a given block size, only a certain number of Bitcoin transactions are possible in the block.
No number of payment layers can support more Bitcoin transactions than that. If it is supporting more transactions than will fit in a block, then these people aren't transacting Bitcoin but some other money, and meanwhile the Bitcoin are somewhere else.
You can call it a payment layer. I call it "banking."
As a long term Bitcoin investor I assure you this places you firmly out of step with the vision of Bitcoin proposed by Satoshi which is the vision I signed onto when I began investing in this space.
That you and your company propose to replace Bitcoin transactions with some other kind of transaction is unacceptable. It places you and all the developers that are associated with your company at a complete loss when discussing the limitations of Bitcoin scalability, as your credibility on the topic cannot possibly be neutral. That the rift has largely fallen out according to who is and who is not associated with your company, and the subsequent behaviour of members of the team (duplicity, autocratic tactics, extreme levels of immaturity etc), just ices the cake.

Absolutely. Your example is reductio ad absurdum but it implies that Bitcoin has done *absolutely everything right* to get to that point and there is zero chance that the economic incentives are not working correctly.
Bitcoin can be effectively decentralized and still only be served from a handful of data centers, if the economic incentives are working as designed. 


I think it's exciting work. But, until its functional, it's of no utility. Moreover, to the extent that its mere existence is being used to foil Bitcoin scalability improvements, then I consider it somewhere between nuisance and threat.

This is the same for Bitcoin: if you hold Bitcoin, your Bitcoin are, and will always be traded on the blockchain controlled by the economic majority, and you must accept their decisions as expressed through a majority vote on the validity of blocks. Just like in a democracy, if you don't accept the will of the majority, your only choice is to leave or advocate for change.
That's how Bitcoin works. It's Bitcoin 101, clearly laid out in the white paper. 
That you disagree with the fundamental intrinsic design of Bitcoin and wish to make it something different is not surprising: it's evident that you are not a supporter of Satoshi's vision of permissionlessness, as evidenced by your tendency towards authoritarianism and strong desire for control over something that was designed to evade capture by special interests such as yourself.

If you give me a "physical Bitcoin" (something that doesn't actually exist), what you are actually doing is handing me the keys to a wallet that contains the coin.
I have no way of knowing that you don't have a copy of the keys, so now I have to trust you. Moreover in order to give me X bitcoin, unless you just happen to have a wallet with X bitcoin in it, you must first perform an on chain Bitcoin transaction in order to have a wallet with only X in it to hand to me in the first place.
So my answer is "no." It's a "trust-required" off-chain transaction (preceeded by another on-chain transaction to create a wallet with X in it in the first place).

Wallets are wallets. Anyone can make one. I've rolled changes to mine and I'm sure you've modded yours. The system is open and permissionless. No person or group controls the spec. Or rather, the elusive but all important economic majority controls the spec. That's the whole point of Bitcoin. But you know that already.
Bitcoin has entered its "browser wars" phase. In this phase, several competing alternative clients with different rule sets will vye for market share. 
Since Bitcoin's system of incentives works, changes to the protocol are more likely than not to improve the value and utility of the money. These implementations shouldn't be considered a threat. Beneficial changes will generally be adopted. Harmful changes will generally be rejected.
The "threat" that alternative clients pose is not to Bitcoin, but to the Core team. We did not invest in Core. We invested in Bitcoin. Core is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not Core. Core is just one "browser", and many others will come.
We who invested in the idea that Bitcoin would advance through the market of competing ideas being tested against the Blockchain don't accept the monolithic development vision being promoted by Core / Blockstream or the tactics being employed.

I have read proposals for various payment channels. They are interesting uses of Bitcoin. However, the Bitcoin that I bought cannot be exchanged point to point with anyone using any of these solutions. Alternative payment networks are in no way *Bitcoin* and do nothing to help scale *Bitcoin* transactions.
The fact that you actively use your knowledge and title to dissemble the facts and pretend that sidechains are a way to scale *Bitcoin* transactions is just shameful.
Suppose my goal is to be the Johnny Appleseed of Bitcoin: create a Bitcoin wallet for each human on earth and send each person some satoshi. Currently I am limited to ~3 people per second receiving Bitcoin in their Bitcoin wallets. If Lightning went online today, the number would still be 3 people per second. You know this, I know this, but you dissemble. Shame shame shame. Using your knowledge and power to misinform others for your personal gain. Shame shame shame. And an academic at that. Oh my.
Regardless as a long term investor and an enthusiastic student of the technology I must say that I disagree vehemently with your company, its mission, its ideas, and its tactics. I think you and your group have become a cancer on Bitcoin. Where you see day, I see night.
There is however room for agreement. Close your browser, open an editor, and deliver *actionable code*. When I see what is delivered, then I will consider it on its merits.
I've managed a fair bit of very high level IT. I have projects with billion dollar impact under my belt. I think you and your guys are wankers. But in the end code talks and bullshit walks. If you guys can deliver then you'll have earned my sincere apologies.  And I promise they'll be sincere - I'm old enough to have been proven wrong before and humble enough to say when I've stepped in it.
Until then I consider you and your group absolutely hostile to the vision of Bitcoin laid out by Satoshi which I and others have invested in.  I consider you and your group a direct financial threat.

This is because nodes have a policy not to relay double-spend txns.
It has been suggested that a solution to this is to relay double-spend attempts, so that the network is aware of this behavior, and can adapt, under the logic "more information is preferred to less."
It's apparently a pretty useful idea since some payment processors work around this limitation / feature by monitoring the network to try to detect the double spend even though it isn't well-relayed. 
Is there a similar FAQ on why we don't do this?

There are miners, nodes, and holders. Those form the basis of Bitcoin consensus:
Miners vote with hashpower.

Holders vote by buying or selling.

The wallet should automate it. 
For POS transactions where RBF is not the default, [I suggested this]( elsewhere. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 10:13:49
Miners are also free to do whatever they please to the consensus rules.  For example it is trivial to change the source to pay yourself 100 btc per block.  The only thing that prevents this is the assurance that other miners and nodes will reject your blocks.
Likewise, miners which include marked RBF transactions can have their blocks rejected if a majority of miners and nodes decide to run code that rejects these transactions.
@_date: 2015-11-30 09:16:00
is correct. Given a mempool full of both RBF and non-RBF transactions all of the same value, a rational miner will prioritize the non-RBF transactions.
@_date: 2015-11-30 07:52:35


Why not?
Edit: I was going to disagree but instead decided to be polite and simply ask for clarification, but got downvoted without response for asking the question.
So here's why I think you're mistaken. Maybe this will provoke a reply instead of a downvote.
Without RBF, a POS merchant can accept a 0-conf with very low risk of fraud. The fraudster has to commit the crime at the exact moment of sale, face to face with the merchant who has a good chance of detecting via the POS if a double-spend is attempted. It's about as risky as paying with counterfeit bills or just outright shoplifting.
With RBF the customer pays at the terminal, *walks out the door with the merchandise*, and hits "undo". Totally different risk proposition.
Now maybe you'll explain what I'm missing.
Thanks.

You misunderstood the suggestion. 
The suggestion was to embed the RBF_NOT_ACCEPTED flag on the POS QR or other payment code. The payers wallet software would recognize the code and send a non-RBF txn to the merchant. 
It's a way to ensure that RBF doesn't occur in a POS situation where the merchant is comfortable accepting 0-conf txns.

If this were true, then anybody could trivially kill Bitcoin by simply running a mining operation that expresses different consensus rules.
Fortunately the system of "voting with CPU" designed by Satoshi works, such that all consensus rules are ultimately determined by the economic majority. This prevents a hostile minority from breaking the rules and "killing Bitcoin."
This also means that if the economic majority changes its mind about its preferred consensus rules, the rules can be changed, even if a small minority disagree.
This does not "kill Bitcoin." It is in fact intrinsic to the way Bitcoin was designed to work. It is the very basis of "permissionlessness" and protection against hostile capture of the system.

If mining was unprofitable such that only altruists mined, then conducting a 51% attack would be dirt cheap.

Without invoking a blocksize limit debate:
RBF will be more useful when blocks are typically full.
Currently there's almost always a little (or a lot of) extra room in every block. So almost any transaction with the minimum fee gets included since the cost to add it is almost always less than the fee. In this world a minimum suggested fee works just fine. 
If you imagine a time when Bitcoin becomes very popular, it's quite likely that full blocks become the norm (even if the limit is raised) (and please can we not turn this thread into a blocksize debate).
So consider that scenario. In that world of almost-always-full blocks there needs to be a way to discover the price of the space in the block. If you have a transaction the only sure way to get it seen is to "shoot high" with an arbitrarily large fee. What's needed is a way to bid on the space you need for your transaction, so you pay the minimum price needed to get your txn through.
RBF creates a way for the software to do this. You send the txn with the fee that your wallet suggests as the best fee to get your txn seen in the next N blocks. If there aren't a lot of urgent txns competing for the space then your txn probably goes though. If on the other hand there is a lot of urgent competition for the space then your txn may not get into the block desired. RBF lets your wallet bid-up the txn so you get more priority.
Anyone can get their txn included by attaching an unusually high fee, but consider if blocks are full and lots of people are doing this, they're all overpaying.
RBF in theory can allow you to submit your txn with the lowest fair fee and then bid it up.
This could/should lead to better price discovery for space on the blockchain and lower average fees in full blocks.
Edit: to everyone with questions about why it was implemented this way and not some other way, I'm here to explain, not defend. Someone else will have to defend it.

I think this is good for the community and for Core.
For too long this community has attempted to achieve a "big tent" vision of Bitcoin, with everybody cajoled / prodded under one tent, when the obvious fact is: we don't all agree all of the time.  A simple fact most people overlook is that consensus starts in meatspace.
As I said in my earlier post on the subject, I agreed with the initial removal of Gavin's access (due to hacking fears) but I also agree with simply ejecting any team member who is obstreperous or disagrees with vision / leadership.
Bitcoin is permissionless.  Software development is not.  Software development requires human leaders, gatekeepers and processes in order to function.  Most successful software projects have a pseudo-autocratic leader (either formally or informally) with a clearly articulated vision; OR they have a very coherent team membership who all share a common vision and roadmap.  In the earliest days, Satoshi was the "leader" with a clearly articulated vision.  Now, the team is much more diffuse - all the more need for team coherence.
I have yet to see a single case where disagreement to the point of infighting produced improved results.
In short: less is more.

This is where you're somewhat mistaken.
As a sole proprietor, I can accept bitcoin transactions directly into a smartphone or other local wallet exactly as if I'm receiving cash into the register. So there's no middlemen in the transaction and therefore no processing fees.

I have bitcoin, I live in developed countries, and I use them. It's faster and easier than cards with less friction. So where does that leave us?

You should not accept cash at the register, it could be counterfeit. 
You should not accept checks at the register, they could be hot.
You should not accept cards at the register, they could reverse charges. 
You should not accept 0-conf at the register, it could be double spent. 
You should *only* accept Bitcoin payments and you must wait several minutes to hours for *each* person at the register to ensure there is no double spend.
In fact, you should get out of retail altogether. It's too damn risky.

Correct, but when they send you the correct value in a reversible transaction you are obligated now to wait and make sure it confirms. That's what I mean about exception-handing at the POS.
You can't just tell them "sorry you don't get your merchandise because you have the wrong settings." you'll have to take the transaction into an exception handling process.
Edit: hopefully user wallets will have RBF turned off by default and make it hard to turn on, and then only on a per transaction basis.
Edit: better, hopefully there can be a way to show a payable QC that encodes "RBF NOT ACCEPTED". That might be worthy of a BIP actually.

Because banks are generations behind technologically. Until recently ACH payments were sent as insecure plaintext flat files over unsecured FTP. Now they've advanced all the way to SFTP.
Until Bitcoin, they were under zero pressure to innovate, as the system had a monopoly over money transfer and storage. Now suddenly a new way has emerged to do the value added portion of their job and they're going to rush to add the word "blockchain"  to their shareholder reports (because that's a tasty buzzword) while avoiding or outright repudiating Bitcoin (because that's a scary buzzword).

Except not. It is opt in for the sender. Bitcoin is a push system, receivers have no control over the transaction. 
Which means as a retailer who accepts 0-conf, a customer can still send you an RBF transaction.
Which means you can either accept it and take the risk, or you'll have to exception-handle AT THE POS.

That's a good point. 
I find blockchains to be clumsy, inefficient, network-wasteful data structures whose clumsiness and wastefulness is only justified by its inherent, decentralized security and the applications that require this. 
I guess I still find it horribly counterintuitive that a blockchain is a useful data store for any application that doesn't absolutely require this level of security (to protect some valuable content on the blockchain).
What I think I hear you saying is that it is really the consensus reaching ability of a blockchain that is useful here, and ironclad security is less important since the contents are of trivial importance.

@_date: 2015-02-07 17:53:20
This is a good discussion. 
A debt based inflationary money encourages a debt based lifestyle (personally and nationally) because cheap readily available personal debt makes it inefficient to ever save money: it is more advantageous instead for the individual to just keep borrowing. So consumers end up with mortgages, credit cards, and car loans for stuff they can't actually afford. The banks own the stuff (cars houses tvs etc) and consumers go to work to try to pay these things off. Often the object (say, a car) depreciates faster than it can be paid for and is still a financial liability after it is no longer useful. Homes do this as well especially the cheap mass produced wooden frame homes built in America. Imagine owing $200K on a $400K mortgage and learning the underlying asset has structural defects that render it basically a throwaway. This happened to my in-laws. They had to file for bankruptcy because they wound up so upside-down and live with me now. Moving on... 
This system "works" because there is no alternative type of money to choose, so we keep adding to the overall net debt, feeding the engine that is the current financial system. As long as more debt continues to be demanded and created the money keeps inflating. Inflation (also known by other names like "quantitative easing") is required in this system because it makes existing debt "tolerable" in the future: debt is issued in today's dollars (euro) and repaid in tomorrow's cheaper dollars. And so it goes...
If there was a choice of competing monies it should be obvious that the Nash equilibrium would be a deflationary asset-based money instead of an inflationary money, as it is clearly a "stronger" value-bearing instrument (ask: would you accept a currency today that would be worth less tomorrow, if instead you could choose a currency that would be worth more tomorrow?)
Given such a money - and the self control to save it - individuals can go from net borrowers to net savers. *This is how individual wealth is created.*
If a money such as this became sufficiently widely used, then people would stop acquiring more and more debt. The overall rate of debt creation would slow and conceivably reverse and the fiat currency would deflate. If that happens then all the debt denominated in that currency becomes ever harder to repay and the system would conceivably enter a deflationary death spiral. 
The only tool a central bank really has to stimulate use of its currency is to keep lowering interest rates and inflating the currency. Deflation is deadly to this system because it renders the mountain of existing debt unpayable. But further debasing the currency would just drive people harder to use the deflationary, alternative currency.
I have no idea if Bitcoin will be this new deflationary currency or if it will be some other currency, but now that open source currency is a reality, it is certain to me that *eventually* a sufficiently useful and deflating alternative to fiat currency will gain traction and the above scenario will play out in some fashion. 
It's hard to see how this ends well for fiat money.

First of all you're now chatting with a guy who flunked a term paper because he wrote it using a word processor. Because "in the real world you're going to have to use a typewriter". (That was literally the last year I ever used a typewriter). 
But let's start at the top.
*The Internet? We are not interested in it.*
-- Bill Gates, 1993
That right there should end the discussion. He later revised his memory of the subject:
*when the Internet came along, we had it as a fifth or sixth priority.*
This is *Bill Gates*. Not your mom or a newsweekly reporter. 
In your revisionist view, the transformative power of the internet was something that everybody grokked. The truth is: only a tiny minority ever predicts transformative technologies correctly. 
*There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.*
– Ken Olsen (CEO of Digital Equipment), 1977
I know this isn't a quote about the Internet but consider: this guy was CEO of IBMs best rival. Neither DEC nor IBM nor Wang nor Hewlett Packard believed there was any future in PCs. They were going to be a *fad.* And the truth is: lots of people who bought Apple ][s and TRS-80s were just buying what was *to them* just a fad toy. Fuck, there were no apps. After a few *years* we got VisiCalc and WordPerfect. People bought computers and said "ok now what?" We played a lot of Breakout, Pong, and Asteroids. $2500 (like ~~$20~~ $10K in 2015 dollars) for a *lame game machine*. 
Conversely, have you ever heard of [Knowledge Navigator]( It remains one of the best predictions about how people would use computers / the Internet 30 years in the future. I was in MBA school when this came out so I remember it well. Trust me it was *mocked*. "Jobs needs to quit dropping acid and start running a business," remains my favorite quote. 
If people generally had really understood the importance of the Internet, we'd be using Wikipedia by Britannica, getting emails via the USPS national email service, buying books from borders.com, using the online classifieds from our local newspapers instead of Craigslist, renting movies online from blockbuster, listening to streaming music on RIAA.com, watching porn on playboy.com, playing games on miltonbradley.com and using the yellow pages online instead of searching on Google or Yahoo. 
The reason that virtually no incumbent dominated the post-Internet landscape - even though they had almost every advantage (capital, market share, brand recognition) is simple: *practically none of them saw it coming.*

To hear the trolls around here and to observe their upvotes, it's trivial to beat money out of people and it happens all the time,  but only with bitcoin. 
This stupid argument that Bitcoins are not safe because of so called rubber hose cryptanalysis needs to die in a fire but the trolls love to upvote it anyway despite lacking even one case where this has actually been used to take someone's bitcoin. And despite the rather glaring fact that fiat in cash or banks is still much easier to confiscate.

Answer: yes. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:36:53
You're missing the point. 
It's *you* who will be taking on the risk. 
*He* won't ever hold Bitcoin.  When a Bitcoin sale comes in, he's going to give *you* the Bitcoin and deduct it from your remaining wages.
He has *zero* exposure to price.
And if you really operate on super low margins then the 1-3% I'm guessing you pay to execute a card transaction could mean double profit for him (here in the USA grocery store margins are usually 1-3%). Doesn't your boss want to make double profit on Bitcoin transactions?

Absolutely not.

This is actually correct. 
Now, how do you see consensus being achieved?
AFAICT as long as the ecosystem is healthy, this would be impossible to achieve. And if the ecosystem has collapsed to the point where this change could be pushed out, then the entire bitcoin experiment already failed. 
I think it's OK to point out that the currency is limited by consensus but we should be quick to also note that is not likely going to ever change for so long as bitcoin is actually functioning.

No, *converting to fiat is missing the whole point* of using Bitcoin to avoid things like banking fees and middlemen.
Just explain to your boss that receiving the Bitcoin is free, but converting to fiat costs 3%. Tell him you'll be willing to accept a portion of your pay in Bitcoin so he can avoid paying 3% to convert. Tell him you'll accept the Bitcoin as wages at the moment he accepts them for payment so he isn't exposed to volatility. He wins, you win, the customer wins, and Stockholm gets a *real* Bitcoin business. 
*That's* how it's supposed to work.
@_date: 2015-02-14 10:30:14
I'm speaking to the point Roger made.
Fiat &gt; Bitcoin &gt; Fiat is obviously an intermediate stepping stone since even an idiot can realize that with bitcoin the cost of *transferring money* is practically zero and the price being paid to remittance middlemen is the cost of  *money changing*. 
When you work for a subsistence wage saving 5-10% is a tremendously big deal. 
That creates plenty of incentive for workers to seek jobs that will pay in bitcoin and to seek landlords and utilities that will accept them, and if you are paying attention you'll realize it's already happening.
How long it might take to actually render the existing industry obsolete is anybody's guess. I'll agree that these things often take a lot longer than one might expect / hope. For example in 2003 I was asked by a Fortune 100 company to design and implement a gigantic *auto fax* system. This was a company that only switched to email in 2000. Revenues of ~$7B.
Stay with me. This gets good. 
The reason they wanted fax? "Our 100,000+ suppliers are unskilled laborers and mom/pop businesses half of whom are probably here in the US illegally and don't even speak English and no way can they do email much less a Web site." 
After months of challenging the company on this I re-engineered the entire payment process with said suppliers, eliminating invoicing altogether which saved the company 3% on its total cost of labor and which saved the suppliers ~30 days on their payment cycle time. All the suppliers had to do was to use the Web site we built for them -  something I was promised would never happen.
*We got better than 90% participation in the first six months.*
**TL;DR the sort of people who leave their country to hack out a living in a foreign country to support their families back home are not afraid of learning challenging new things and taking big risks if they help to improve their financial situation back home, and we shouldn't be quick to write off their ability to innovate,  because they'll surprise us every time.**

What is a payment network retard?


Sentences don't end in prepositions. This sentence is so contorted it is unclear what you are trying to say.


You do understand that is an artificially imposed limit for which solutions are already available that can scale to "Visa-like" throughput?
Trust is an inherent part of the modern payment infrastructure (ACH, Visa, etc). All of it operates within a ring of trust that costs money to secure and defend, and at a level of security much lower than Bitcoin's.
You are right that Bitcoin is both a currency and a payment network.  Comparing the total cost to create and defend the currency *and* network to just the cost of a payment network with no currency to flow through it is an invalid comparison.

I don't think it would be difficult for a small business that is doing at most a few bitcoin transactions a day and has an employee willing to take bitcoin as pay. Just record the fiat value of the sale and disburse the bitcoin. At next payroll deduct the total amount paid out from the paycheck as a payroll advance.
If you have a more complicated business or if you are actually taking in more in bitcoin than you can pay out in wages then yes, this wouldn't work. Conversely if you're taking in more in bitcoin than you can pay out in wages, you have what we consultants call a "good problem."

No, they saw it as a nerdy, computer - bound, unreliable version of faxing, which was already free and instant and much more ubiquitous -  and much more visually rich, not to mention being able to transmit signatures valid in court.
Email was not free. You had to pay a monthly fee to get online. Via slow modems. Or your company could pay thousands per month for a T1 to send emails to nobody since everyone was using fax for business. 
Source: used email (fidonet) in mid 80s. By the mid 90s it was still just barely catching on in corporate America. In 2000 rolled out email system for a fortune 100 company that was just deciding maybe it needed to get in the game. In 2003 had to convince same company (&gt;$7B in revenue) not to deploy multi million dollar autofax system. 
It happened a lot slower than you'd like to believe.

This does not include equipment rental or other processing fees.
Merchants typically rent the hardware which includes on site POS PCs, a file server, networking and other gear plus a maintenance contract. The middleman provides POS configuration and processing support you can't get from a bank.
If you own and configure and support your own hardware and have onsite technical services who can afford to maintain all the middleware then you have to account for the cost of that support too.

Yes and no.  I mean, operating a Bitcoin business is itself a huge red flag for an insurer.  How does one underwrite a Bitcoin business with all the scams plus all the security gotchas that insurance companies are unlikely to grok.
But if you are operating an *ethical* business, and using good security practices, then the cost to insure really should be quite low, because Bitcoin does offer very strong security features when used correctly.  So it would make sense, if you were operating such a business, to self-insure through a spinoff.
Note I'm not defending Xapo, just pointing out that self-insurance is both indicative of good or bad business, depending on the situation.

Came here to say this, then realized that actually if 21 achieves their vision, then the best comparison is the original IBM PC.
Generally speaking, 30-year old apps written for the original PC can still be run on about a billion devices today including the $5 raspberry pi.
Apple fought cloning, so software written for the ][ could only be run on those devices (more or less). There are probably only a few thousand devices that can still run Apple ][ software and nobody developing for it. Dead end.
PCs on the other hand became ubiquitous commodity devices. Code written for those devices ran "everywhere" (and will now also even run on Mac HW). As a result, most software development moved to that platform, creating the network effect that drove PC popularity and success. 
If 21 achieves its vision of making its platform ubiquitous, then we will see an entire ecosystem of Bitcoin-transacting applications (and probably also ancillary hardware) grow up around it, just like the PC.

UPDATE: regarding my assumption that this event happened in 2011: the person who "found" the 11,000 btc claims he had to guess a password to unencrypt the wallet.  identified that Bitcoin 0.4.0 was the first Bitcoin client to get encryption in Sept 2011.
In [this thread]( he (and I) made the assumption that the person must have mined the Bitcoin on or after Sept 2011.  That was the basis of my post being dated in 2011.
However: it's entirely possible that the Bitcoin were mined much earlier at a time when CPU mining really could get you "a few thousand a week" and then the wallet.dat was encrypted some years later and then the weed and the forgetting etc.
So - we rate the argument below: DEAD FUCKING WRONG
In 2011 a decent CPU would get ~4MH/s.  GPU mining was already available.  In January 2011 the total network hashrate was already &gt; 100GH/s (by the summer the hashrate was being measured in tens of TH/s).
To get 11000 BTC requires mining 220 blocks @ 50 BTC per block.  To do so in 1 month would require finding roughly 5% of the blocks for that month.
That means that we can assume that the miner would need ~5% of the total 100GH/s = 5GH/s mining capability (that would be assuming that he was mining in January - if he was mining in July, when the total network hash rate was 10,000 GH/s, he would have needed 500GH/s).
So, if he was CPU mining @ 5MH/s in January 2011, to achieve 5GH/s, he would have needed 1000 CPUs to mine ~11000 in a month.  By July he would have needed 100,000 CPUs.
Let's say he was mistaken and was using a GPU instead of his CPU.  Typical GPUs in 2011 produced ~20X the hashrate of CPUs - so let's say he had a 100MH/s GPU.  He would still require 50 GPUs.
We rate this story FALSE.
EDIT: [this thread]( dated Wed Mar 16, 2011 6:08 pm is a nice time-capsule into mining at the time.  Here's a pertinent quote:




So a miner *with a GPU* would expect to find one (50 BTC) block more or less every month.  With a CPU, it would be unlikely to find a block at all, ever, even if you started in January 2011 and were still mining with it.
We update our rating to PANTS ON FIRE

**Blockchain security is directly proportional to coin value.** 
If a blockchain produces 1000 coins per day and the coins are worth $1 then total investment in mining infrastructure will be limited to $1000/ day max.
If the coins are worth $1000 each then the market will spend up to $1000000/day to mine it. 
The entire security model rests on it being financially counterproductive to try to acquire enough mining hardware to launch a 51% attack.

It's more than that. Everybody is looking at the first order effect and ignoring the second order effect. 
It may be true that the first order effect on price was minimal. Maybe as says it was never more than a few pennies per trade. I can believe that easily enough. But the analysis can't stop there. 
As anyone who follows this market knows, during times of slow trading, the inflation effect is quite visible. Bitcoin doesn't trade sideways: the price sags. This produces obvious negative sentiment. 
In short, Willy ate the inflationary sag. Instead of watching the price get nibbled away by inflation during periods of slow action, we watched the price creep slowly up.

We have that. 
Each implementation is a walled garden controlled by its own devs.  Core is a walled garden. So are other implementations with differing consensus rules. We all have the freedom to choose any one of them. If sufficient numbers of us choose any one, we have defined the protocol through our consensus decision to run like-minded implementations. Currently the overwhelming majority are choosing to remain in Core's walled garden. 
That's the governance model built into Bitcoin.

You seem to think that any variability in employee take home is a "clusterfuck." You obviously don't have any idea what I'm talking about. In my example the employees already earn variable pay because they work for tips. Or if you hire hourly contractors, their pay varies. It is called "normal." Not a clusterfuck. 
*There is no issue.* You don't have any idea what you're talking about. **It's precisely exactly completely 100% the same accounting process as though you accept cash as payment and advance an employee some money.** Happens every day in small businesses all over the world. It is *literally* trivial. You obviously are not willing to think it through. I'm tired of trying to explain the obvious to you. 


So what is your point? That accepting a payment that takes no effort and might result in an additional sale is a bad idea because it might not result in an additional sale? Not much of an entrepreneur are you. 
What point are you trying to make? It's zero effort to accept bitcoin. If you have an employee that wants to earn some (which was the whole premise anyway) then it is literally exactly 100% as easy as taking a cash transaction. 100% Not 99%. 100%. The. Same.

So I spent the better part of my career educating clients about the time value of their money and showing them how operational efficiency can squeeze time, and therefore money,  out of the process. For example one of my projects eliminated invoicing altogether -  as goods are received and work is performed, payments are made automatically - and that was before programmable money. Programmable money really can change everything from a business process standpoint. 
With programmable money the possibility exists to remove the need to hold and stockpile cash because payments can be made in continuous flow in real time as costs are incurred. An intelligently designed business process based entirely on programmable money would mean that the only money that would need to be retained is a very small amount to cover operational variability.
If all revenue and expense could be earned in bitcoin than I can design a business process that is practically immune to price slippage and leaves nothing for a thief to steal. 
I recognize that I'm talking about the "should-be"  business process not the "as-is" process. First we need to understand what can be done, so that then we can evaluate if its worth it to try to get there. For pot merchants I'd say the answer is a giant YES.
As for governments position on accepting bitcoin for drugs, while its impossible to say what Our Fair Leaders might or might not do, from a practical standpoint, the blockchain is far more auditable and accountable than piles of cash in boxes.

I know weed is super profitable but merchants don't hold all their revenue, they spend most of it immediately on stock, labor, rent, etc. The idea behind a programmable currency is to enable value chain transactions so you pay suppliers,  labor etc in near real time as you use the service.

That is a strange perspective.  You have confused the chicken and the egg.
You cannot validate a chain that they do not mine.  And you cannot invalidate a chain that they do not mine.
Miners come first.  The mining network can stand up and run with no other users or nodes to validate it.  The coin might be worth very little, but there will be coins, and they will have value, and the blockchain they create will be secure.
Conversely, all the validating nodes in the world cannot produce a blockchain to be followed.  For example, I might consider blocks &lt; 1 MB invalid if the mempool is &gt; some threshold.  That's certainly my right, but I will be validating and following a void, unless someone mines it.
Miners control and define the chain they mine.  Whether or not you follow it is your business, but you don't create coins, or a blockchain, so miners are neither following your chain nor using your coins.

**This is the exact misunderstanding of blockchains OP is calling out.**
The value of a blockchain is to *ensure consensus* of recordkeeping among *untrusted participants* in a network. The overhead associated with maintaining a blockchain is very high, but this is the cost of achieving trustless consensus. 
If you assume that the participants in the network are within a circle of trust, blockchains offer zero - actually negative -  benefit versus a traditional shared / replicated database.  A traditional database is far more efficient, scalable, searchable, and flexible than data stored in a blockchain. The only thing that a blockchain can do that a traditional database can't is to be trustless.

This is how I see btc helping with remittance initially, as a starting point. 
What is the single largest expense most working families have? Rent.
*Try to get your landlord to accept Bitcoin.* For best results, identify several families who receive remittances who live under the same landlord and approach the landlord together.
How much does remittance cost you as a percentage? Offer half that as a bonus to the landlord to encourage acceptance.
Now approach the employer and see if you can receive that amount of your pay in Bitcoin.
I understand most landlords and employers will refuse, but some will say yes, particularly if you give them the savings you save from not using a middleman.
With the middleman gone, you then work on expanding your ability to spend bitcoin naively at home. Maybe a grocer or a phone company will accept your bitcoin.

Yes but measured by market cap the opposite effect is observed IIRC - to borrow an expression, a rising tide may lift all boats but it's the leading coin that rides the wave. 
Also a lot has changed re: alts in the last six months. I'm skeptical that if we had another major bitcoin rally that we would see much movement into alts. But time will hopefully tell ;) 


As coin value rises miners do increase profit, true, but as miners rush to add hashpower they lower their profit margins. Cost to mine will always tend to rise to meet the block reward as measured in "real value".  But how does this prevent price from rising (your original point)? It doesn't follow.

This client reengaged me to roll out a gigantic *auto fax* system in 2002. When I showed them how they could do everything paperless using the Internet they recoiled and told me I didn't understand their business, that it would probably *always be* a fax based business. I finally prevailed and my project saved them tens of millions of dollars. They thought I was crazy until it worked. 
TL;DR most people in the 1990s did *not* think the Internet would be much more than a nerd thing. Only entrepreneurs got it. 
Edit: the fact that I'm being downvoted speaks volumes about the average age of reddit and / or people's selective memory. I started using the Internet in the late 1980s (email, usenet) and it was a decade before most of the people I knew / worked with used it. When I started my first real job in 1992 in a large fortune 100 tech company fax and interoffice mail was still the name of the game. Most managers I worked with printed out their emails.
The world did not leap onto the Internet. If it had, we'd be using Wikipedia by Britannica, getting emails via the USPS national email service, buying books from borders.com, using the online classifieds from our local newspapers instead of Craigslist, renting movies online from blockbuster, listening to streaming music on RIAA.com, watching porn on playboy.com, playing games on miltonbradley.com and using the yellow pages online instead of searching on Google or Yahoo.
The world was not fast to move to the Internet. It was slow. *Startups* were fast to move to the Internet. That is why it was so disruptive to incumbents.

Well you pretty much got your ass handed back to you. 
What's amazing is how circle jerky reddit can be. I don't even go on anymore because as an indie musician with an MBA I positively cringe at the kids telling me to just "adjust"  to the new reality of nobody paying for my work. And any time I jump in to argue the facts of this "new world"  (like how more than 25% of the top grossing artists from last year were Top 40 artists 40 years ago,  when 40 years ago NONE of the Top 40 artists had been in music more than 30 years) I get assraped by kids telling me to "adjust"  to free. 
Reddit can be so odd. I know it isn't homogenous but still... So odd. 
Edit : if the above statistic means nothing to you, I'll break it down. Streamed singles are not sticky, they don't make fans. **Tangible albums make fans.** *Tangibility* is sticky. *Albums* encourage listeners to fall in love with the whole catalog not just a single. Fans are people who know all your songs not just a single. Do you want to pay $30 to go to a show to hear the one single?  No concerts are not fun for most people if they only know one song. As a result a very distorted group of artists are still making the lion's share of money: those artists who came of age in the Album Age and were able to establish durable fan bases.

So you're assuming that "bitcoin remittance" looks like

Where bitcoin is just a pipe 
I think bitcoin remittance looks like 
Bitcoin &gt;&gt; Bitcoin &gt;&gt; Bitcoin 
Where workers get paid in bitcoin, send to their family, and they spend bitcoin. This is the model that, when achieved, renders conventional remittance completely obsolete. This model would create a market cap as large as the entire remittance market as bitcoin would become the "currency of choice" for those tied to an overseas income.

I guess my definition of blockchain is fundamentally something like the Bitcoin blockchain (ie a *bound chain* of blocks): highly tamper resistant by architecture + cryptography, decentralized, and consensus establishing. Probably some other key features as well, I've never really attempted to come up with an ironclad definition. Maybe I'll work on that. 
I would definitely not consider "a database with history" to be a blockchain as there is no "chain of blocks" - linked lists are entirely different, Time Machine is not a blockchain (no consensus building, no chain of blocks, not decentralized etc). This would apply to GIT or Wikipedia or pretty much any data structure you can point to that isn't sufficiently similar to Bitcoins blockchain (it is the current archetype and I'm sure if you mention "blockchain" to 100 devs who understand the word, the mental model that will spring to mind will be something that looks exactly or mostly like the Bitcoin blockchain).
I've built databased IT solutions for almost 30 years. When I was starting out, relational databases were just gaining traction in the marketplace. I've worked with all kinds of engines from old school DB2 on MVS to relational to all kinds of noSQL tech like CouchDB etc. So I have a pretty wide base of experience regarding what makes different database engines unique. I wouldn't call anything that doesn't share most of the distinguishing properties of the Bitcoin database a "blockchain" any more than I would call a "flat database with lookup capability" "relational" even if you could build all the same solutions with it - if it can't do a join, it ain't relational. Etc.
How the decentralized network vets its nodes's work, through PoW, PoS, or other yet undiscovered means, to me is not part of the definition of the data structure. As long as the node must "prove itself" without which there is no consensus establishment. So at least we can agree on that :)

If you are OK having less than exclusive control over your Bitcoin, any number of options are available to you.
However, you only control your Bitcoin if you exclusively control the keys. And only an onchain transaction can place Bitcoin into a wallet whose keys you exclusively control. Offchain transactions like third parties, LN, payment channels, etc do not allow you to exclusively control your Bitcoin.
This isn't controversial, either, it's an obvious design fact.

If I cannot close a payment channel without making an onchain transaction, then clearly the two things are not truly substitutes for each other.  That said, I do agree that in situations in which full control of your Bitcoin are not required, then payment channels are the ideal solution.

Although I agree in principle that not every idea in the white paper is likely to hold forever, it would make sense to outline what are the major defects and then have open and free debate as to whether these are actually defects or just "unsolved problems."
For example I've heard "Bitcoin can't scale onchain" since the very beginning, but clearly, technologies like thinblocks, pruning, sharding, etc definitely provide the possibility of significant onchain scaling without sacrificing the principles of the white paper.
The white paper was what brought many many early adopters like myself onboard, as it represented a clear vision statement.
The point being: to the extent that we can maintain this vision instead of tossing it overboard, we can heal divisions and strengthen the human consensus that underpins hashpower consensus.

I've been trying to make this point since the first LN paper was released: the entire state of a Lightning Network (ie everyone's balances) *rests in a set of 0-conf transactions.*
LN and its sister versions of payment channels are good technologies but they cannot substitute for an onchain transaction.
Only an onchain transaction results in Bitcoin being deposited in a wallet whose keys you exclusively control. And "you only own your Bitcoin if they are in a wallet whose keys you exclusively control."
LN offers countermeasures to prevent theft. Countermeasures are good but they are not proof against loss of funds.
This does not make me anti-LN. It makes me "anti-LN-as-a-substitute-for-onchain-transactions."

Your argument is that it's possible to have a secure PoS with very low market cap for use for "blockchain 2.0" type blockchain activity (ie smart contacts, IoT, or, more likely, some amazing use of distributed consensus that we haven't dreamed up yet).
My argument is that if you are storing valuable information in a blockchain then you are creating a financial incentive to disrupt the blockchain that could be greater than the cost of acquiring the cheap coins to launch an attack.
High market cap / coin price makes this much less likely as the attacker would need far greater financial resources. But without an in-demand, high velocity coin, you'll never achieve a market cap capable of securing the information you're putting in the blockchain.

Yes. I find that my friends are totally disinterested. My take is intellectual laziness. None of them actually understand it, and while I'm happy to educate them, they aren't interested.

The correct answer to the perpetual claim that "since Bitcoin is deflationary therefore nobody will spend them" is "since Bitcoin is deflationary they are very valuable and thus retailers will offer discounts to people who pay in Bitcoin."
Because economics.

The government is continually converting old debt into new. So while you are correct that a rise in rates doesn't mean that the interest on the whole debt immediately rises, it does mean that the interest begins to rise and will continue to rise.

Very well.  The Japanese have avoided hyperinflation and default *so far*.  Agreed.
Regardless, Japan is still living proof that borrowing in excess of your ability to produce *now and in the future* is a death sentence for your nation and its currency.  They have no exit strategy for their debt.

I'm trying to imagine buying Bitcoin from this. I'm old enough to remember before there were ATMs, so I remember the skepticism that had to be overcome when those were new, and of course that  skepticism was quickly overcome. 
But in that case at least the device was being offered by the user's bank, which created a level of trust, since there was already a relationship with the bank.
How do I know these machines are secure and trustworthy? What is backing the transaction? I'm not suggesting that they aren't perfectly legit, but as a nervous new user, what sort of confidence can I have in this device?
Edit: we all know even ATMs aren't necessarily trustworthy. I'm automatically suspicious of sketchy looking ATMs from companies I've never heard of. Why should I feel differently about this machine?

Coinbase is not a trading site like gox. It's a good site for reliably converting USD to BTC and back, but with friction (time and cost).
You can keep your .5 BTC with Coinbase if you like; they function as a wallet. Advantage is that Coinbase seems to offer good security particularly if you use their 2-factor authentication, disadvantage is that like all other online facilities, they are new and could be victim to an attack.
Alternatively you can store your BTC locally in computer or paper wallet. Check out the sidebar resources.
If you create a local wallet, START by testing small transactions to/from it until you get a feel for it. Make backups. Be smart. If you lose your BTC they are gone for good.

This is what I was thinking: make an altcoin based on Bitcoin with a safe, reasonable reserve requirement baked into the infrastructure.

This is a fallacy. In effect you are arguing that Bitcoin will be in such high demand that nobody will accept it.
The reality is that if Bitcoin is in such high demand, merchants will offer discounts to those who purchase in Bitcoin. Moreover if people have a bunch of wealth in Bitcoin and wish to buy something, it would make no sense to convert to dollars with all the friction that entails when instead they can transact with less friction in Bitcoin and also get a discount.

That's absurd. Just sell 50 BTC per day on Coinbase. Done.

It could be an open source altcoin based on (backed by) Bitcoin.
