how so?
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:14:37
if all you have is money but no ideas you don't really have anything.

read the thread. the idea and business model was fully conceptualised and pitched before a large audience and panel of judges and won first prize at a major hackathon event. it wasn't just 2 guys talking in a coffee shop ffs.

it's an important debate: ideas vs means. both are worthless on their own.
So I don't begrudge someone going out and putting the idea into practice but they should fully credit and acknowledge where they got the idea from. To me it's like plagiarism; taking others ideas that have already been formulated and expressed in a public way, and then using them as if they were your own is wrong.
it's not fair for people with financial and industry means to steal ideas from people who don't have those resources available and then claim that ideas are not as important as being the first to implement them.

if you had read the thread you would know that the idea and business model was fully conceptualised and pitched before a large audience and panel of judges and won first prize at a major hackathon event = pretty strong documented evidence by anyones standard. it wasn't just 2 guys talking about random ideas in a coffee shop.
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:14:00
i think you will find good ideas are not everywhere. you probably don't value ideas because you've never had any of any value. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:18:33
can't reply to you until you actually read the thread properly.
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:35:41
if all you are going to do is post about how ideas are worthless and implementation is everything. about 100 people have posted that, so go back to reading your atlas shrugged.

you missed the part about her lying to techstars and thus denying us funding but don't let that get in the way of your browbeating.
@_date: 2015-07-05 11:14:33
yes that's exactly what i thought, then this happened.
it would be a shame if no one went along to hackathons or only worked on 'safe' projects because of a few idiots who lack basic morals.
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:32:56
er..because I'm not going around claiming to have come up with the idea of blockchain?
@_date: 2015-07-05 09:40:28
it's a long story. Basically me an Ed work full time and Aviva were not going to put up any funding so without any finance we didn't think much about how to develop it further. 
Apparently Leanne got a approached by techstars and told them Ed and I were not interested in working on the project (BLATANT LIE). they were only interested in working with her anyway because of her industry connections. they then sorted out her with funding and devs.
she was also helped out by a guy called [name withdrawn for legal reasons] as he had the blockchain connections and knowhow to develop the project further. but she ended up shafting him and cutting him out of the project because he wanted the ledger to be publically accessible and she wanted to keep it closed so she can monetize it better. Crazy stuff!
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:02:47
there should be some law like goodwins law that says the longer a thread goes on reddit the higher the chance that you will just end up debating the definition of words with some autistic dictionary nazi.

lol at all the people on this thread who are like.."but being an unoriginal lying cheating money grabbing scumbag is a good thing??..I don't get the problem here???"
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:12:05
hope i'm never stuck in a sinking boat with such a morally bankrupt creature like yourself.
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:04:03
without knowing you i would say you are of low intelligence.
@_date: 2015-07-05 09:45:46
also I just have to lol at the fact someone who's that shady is trying to create a theft/fraud prevention startup.
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:49:00
or even 200xx now that is powerful.
@_date: 2015-07-05 13:57:39
it wasn't just an idea though. it was formulated and expressed with a clear proof of concept and technical demo and pitched in front of an audience of 150 people. it's not like saying "duh.. what if skate boards could hover!". the person who stole the idea would not be doing what she is doing without meeting us and seeing what we had created so you can argue the lexicon but to me it's stealing.
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:10:14
naive view IMO. you might recite a shakespeare sonnet "better" than shakespeare would, but it doesn't make you shakespeare. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 10:58:36
I agree, that is why this story is so bizarre. normally I would think anyone thinking their ideas would be stolen at a hackathon is paranoid and suffering delusions of grandeur. I once met a guy at one who said with a straight face "I'm not pitching because if youtube ever find out about my idea they will straight up steal it" I laughed at the time but looks like he had the right idea :D
@_date: 2015-07-05 12:31:56
what was that?
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:14:28
not mad at all, you should actually read the thread not jump in trolling
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:48:32
please actually read the thread.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:37:59
yeah because money is the only valuable thing in life, just think you can buy a big TV! and a big house! and a big car! wow!
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:14:03
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:54:00
Not that bothered. I think people are misinterpreting the post as if I'm bitter and angry about it. My view is fair play to anyone who takes the idea and runs with it. I was just offended about that one particular person was claiming she came up with the whole thing herself when she most certainly did not. and also I wanted to warn other people about hackathons as they might really be invested in their idea and then see it poached by someone else which could be devastating to them.
@_date: 2015-07-05 09:57:40
yep. just wanted to warn other people, seems like corporations see hackathons as free R&amp;D and you don't know who's lurking around looking to leech off your creative thinking.
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:38:46
funny how only people with no valuable ideas parrot this mantra.
@_date: 2015-07-05 12:00:30
sounds awesome, will check it out. thanks
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:04:48
how so?
@_date: 2015-07-05 19:07:21
not mad at all. I'm far too busy working on other stuff and I agree ideas are not everything, if someone wants to execute on the idea then fine, but credit where it's due if you didn't come up with the idea yourself. also wanted to give a heads up to anyone who really cherishes their idea and doesn't want anyone poaching it at a hackathon.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:15:42
think 150+ eyeball witnesses and the fact it won the hackathon is proof enough
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:53:53
yeah, not arguing that. all I'm saying is: someone said they came up with an idea when they did not, and there are loads of witnesses and documentation to back it up, and saying you came up with something when you didn't is a dickhead thing to do.
@_date: 2015-07-05 09:19:59
tl:dr - avoid hackathons, industry spies will steal your ideas.
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:38:42
not emotional or feeling bad at all I just like winding up reddit troll commenters.
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:19:38
if you read the thread you would see I'm not arguing that. I'm simply putting it out there that someone who is claiming to have come up with and idea did in fact not.
@_date: 2015-07-05 10:08:23
startupweekend events you pay for the ticket! so actually you're paying to do free, public domain R&amp;D work :D (that greedy people then steal and monetize).
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:14:36
also i think it's important that people know that the CEO of a startup aimed at reducing theft and fraud doesn't mind stealing other people's work.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:17:59
It was our IP. I'm sure most hackathons say that anything you create at the event is your IP. patents take along time, not very practical in the startup world.
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:21:26
ah the USA, utopia on earth! commies beat you to space though :/
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:46:56
I'm really not at all upset or angry and I hear you. ideas/execution is an interesting debate. All I'm saying is IMO it's wrong to say that you came up with an idea when you did not and you should give due credit to where you got the idea.
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:40:30
hmm....people skills from someone who likes to argue on internet forums and has a username 'dyslexicstoner'. I could never afford it.
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:09:06
not arguing that only saying don't go around saying you came up with something when you clearly did not as someone is going to post about it on reddit and make you look foolish :)
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:13:04
yep but don't complain when your societies innovation stagnates because everyone is too selfish and cutthroat to come up with any new ideas
@_date: 2015-07-08 06:40:28
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:11:36
100x? whoa! you told me.
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:10:52
you are just trolling and trying to provoke petty arguments.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:24:54
the fact that you can get away with stealing "ideas" does not make it ethical or right. the only way we progress is through innovation and if creative ideas cannot be 'authored' and all that matters is who has the money to EXECUTE ideas, there is no incentive for people to come up with new and better ideas as it will just be stolen by someone richer and more well connected.
'ideas are worthless' is a naive viewpoint. the law is set up to benefit the rich and powerful it's in their interest to say that ideas are of less value than the execution as that suites them fine and let's them take other people's original ideas and profit off them.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:06:54
didn't down vote you, but don't let that stop your rant :)
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:43:03
yep, you grasped the value of idea. I was just disappointed that we ended up doing free R&amp;D and proof of concept work for some industry douchebag who had never even heard of blockchain before and then tried to pretend she came up with the entire thing.
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:31:25
it was a token gesture so she didn't feel left out.
