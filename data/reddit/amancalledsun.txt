Well done on holding for yourself. I understand from a business perspective, it also yells me there is still ways to grow

Stop killing my long plz

First; relax. You ain't missing out on anything yet. Sure a bull run like this appeals to your spidey senses, but watch and do nothing if you are an inexperienced trader. I can't tell you when to buy or to sell, but never do either out of emotion. Wait and read and ask there for tips on trading.
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:39:41
Yes, no guarantees, no crystal balls etc. If experience taught me anything, *no one* can predict what Bitcoin will do. It does what it does, but it's tantalizing to speculate. Above all, regardless of unit price I feel like I am part of something groundbreaking. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:28:40
Right on, I have cold stored my BTC for over 2 years now. I have a feeling we are on the brink of a .com type boom with our precious BTC.

Edit: soon(ish)
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:36:37
Mainstream for me would be :
1. Seeing "Bitcoin accepted here" at your regular mom &amp; pop cornershop
2. Being able to trade BTC in the "regular" FX market 
3. Not having people at parties stare you blankly in the face when you say "Bitcoin" 
As for a percentage I would be hard pressed, but I would consider Bitcoin mainstream if 5 out of 10 people *know* what Bitcoin is, even without having to be involved in Bitcoin in some fashion. In my own social circles hardly anyone is either aware or involved in Bitcoin, sure I tried to explain it to people, but they aren't (yet) really listening.

Not mainstream by a longshot imho. Yes we know about Bitcoin, probably for a couple of years, but it's just for the past year or so that institutional investors are really getting involved. The public will follow, but it will take time. Bitcoin won't be going away, that's a thing we do know now.

Hi Ed

My name is amancalledsun and I'm a bitcoinity.org/markets-a-holic

Thanks for the acknowledgment :) As for exchanges I've heard good things about Bitfloor if you're in the US and Bitstamp if you're in Europe. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:56:10
Thanks ! yes no shame in acknowledging I'm a Nerd :-)

We merely adopted the lag, Mt Gox was born in it, molded by it. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 08:45:31
Yes my thoughts as well, it's ridiculous. But since its a *daily* limit, no one needs to spend so much on food every day from now on. That will leave some headroom to invest in BTC and get money out of the country ASAP :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:37:46
No one knows, there are no safe bets regarding Bitcoin, we're in uncharted waters for the most part. But take it from me that the moment you post here to ask about investing you've already made up your mind :-) 
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:59:14
I invested a small amount of fiat in BTC with a couple of my mates after explaining to them it's worth a shot. They didn't understand the workings of wallets and exchanges and such, so I am basically the treasurer by holding our wallet. Anxious text messages ensued with the price dropping to $110 "dude we should sell NOW" &amp; "what's happening OMG" I didn't respond for an hour or so and then I send them  this pic 
@_date: 2013-03-28 08:50:59
If losing it all won't get you into trouble I'd say go for it. Of course this is a worst case scenario, but that's the thing to keep in mind. Don't put money you need for food or rent into BTC, the market is currently to volatile for that; the price may drop 80 % in a week on one hand, but on the other it may rise beyond 80 % as well. But if you can invest 60 bucks a month without skimping on essential things, why not? the possible gains are way bit higher than any interest paid by banks on regular currency savings.

I just love the British humour :-) Hats off to you sir
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:13:25
Lol thats awesome :) there's also mind altering properties to Bitcoin itself, because I.can't.stop.watching.the.charts... One can only guess what this exposure will do to me, my eyes have already turned blue..
@_date: 2013-03-28 08:58:42
True, it's a tragedy without a doubt. I watched the news and people working at the bank for 20 years were being laid off without much deliberation it seemed. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:23:44
Essentially no one is. Some of us ride this Bitcoin rollercoaster buckled in, others have limbs out of the carts. But we're all riding blindfolded, merely trusting the safety inspections of the track. The trick is this :

dude that should be the bitcoin anthem...

@_date: 2013-04-07 16:33:37
Awesome :-)
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:04:14
And yet again I must post this: 
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:40:20
Thanks a lot ! that clears it up.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:00:35
Somehow these minicrashes make me a more firm believer in Bitcoin. Sounds strange, but with every minicrash I'm thinking "Spartans, hold" (got that from a pic someone posted a while ago) the price will eventually mellow out, and if that's at $10 or $1000 is all the same to me, as long as I have a general, stable alternative to fiat I"m a happy man.
Edit : I'd like to add that of course making a profit is nice, but I simply own too little coins to call myself a trader. I'm in for the long run.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:04:15
Pathetic, grow a pair and talk to girls. If you think money will buy you a relationship you'd be better off spending it on strippers.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:01:48
You might be right.I also checked facebook and the Bitcoin page has a meager 11k likes whereas there are around 1400+ people talking about Bitcoin on Facebook. This might mean that despite widespread media coverage the whole phenomenon hasn't reached the masses yet. Cautiously I'd say we're still in the very early stages with enough headroom for growth.

Great, just what this upcoming market needs; more scammers. My advise to you: GTFO
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:18:59
Ok, but still you have to agree that your business proposal sounds a bit fishy to say the least. What would you do if some stranger passes you in the street and says "look bud, buy this rock from me for $200. If you don't like it, I'll take it back for $220 next week, I'll be standing right here again"
