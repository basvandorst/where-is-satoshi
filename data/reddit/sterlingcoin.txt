The user 'itsgremlin' has sadly came across our post for Sterlingcoin and without any research whatsoever has proclaimed it as "some shitcoin".  
Please take a look at the above links to see our progress PRIOR TO LAUNCH on the 20th of September.

We offer a fully functioning currency that can be used from the day of launch. Also with Exchange(s), merchants services, FIAT/SLG purchase and ATMs we believe no other coin has launched with such services.

OK so. Here is an angle which no one has really covered. Let's imagine encryption on messages gets removed and access to everyones messages on all systems become a reality.  
  
Databases would be created to catalog our comments, stance, view and outlook on the world (which is already happening).  
  
Now imagine a tyrannical, facist government took control and had access to this database (one more so than the current Anglo/American government). They could single out people who stood against their regime and black bag etc.  
  
This is why we need to have encryption. In reality, away from the net we can choose where and who to talk to about whatever subject matter we wish, on the internet this isn't the case once encryption is removed.

Indeed, it's a cryptographic hash function to increase the security of encryption.

Also, good luck removing the encrypted messaging in the open source freely distributed Sterlingcoin wallet Mr Cameron ;)

They create SHA256 and now they regret it :D
