[My take on it.](
Basically the bitcoin community is not resisting proposed EU regulation and calling out the corruption like it has in the past.  The problem is that it has worn itself out by all the infighting and is demoralized.  No-on is speaking out against the injustice of how the EU is trying to control bitcoin.

And all the others don't have this particular hangup on block size.  They're being adults about the problem and looking to share solutions instead of shutting others out in power plays.  The result is a rift (probably inflamed by rbuttcoin or similar ilk) that is hobbling bitcoin's potential.  Its an absolutely stupid fight that should not be happening.

So if a country is about to go belly up and their currency devalued is not an opportunity?  What about those people who will need an alternative?  Isn't one of the major pushes for bitcoin (at least in the past) all about providing an alternative to the corrupt banking system?

Those who support a split want to see bitcoin succeed and most have bitcoins invested.  They are far more interested in seeing a change in leadership that is not hostile and divisive, but since there is no clear path to a better leadership that more people can agree on, the only option is to split (a non-hostile hard fork to a new set of coins), and to compete on the merits of new leadership and innovative changes.

And who is going to do the work?  If the bitcoin community cannot compromise and continues to fight against itself, then "energy" and the motivation evaporates.  The difference and motivations need to be openly and positively (or at least respectfully) discussed without discounting either camp.  Compromise will be needed so everyone can get along.  If one group is shut out, then the fighting will continue and the price and potential will lag.

That's fine.  Nothing wrong with a different implimentation.


Sort of false.  The rift IS a problem.  Can the Unlimited team actually talk with Core, or will they be shut out?  Does Core actually reach out to alternative implementations or are they viewed as the enemy?


It is small, but transactions created with XThin and Compact could potentially cause loss of coins, and it highlights the actual problem with the rift.

Value of bitcoin comes from people.  People value bitcoin for various reasons.  Buy and hold is just one.   Buy and use, as a protest against state power is another, privacy, control over one's wealth (to cross borders without harassment), are just a few others.  However, if the cost to buy and use becomes high, people will start to question its actual usefulness.

Instead of PoS grinding, how about a mix?  You still have to perform PoW, but you need PoS to submit your PoW.  Also, the PoW required decreases the longer you have not received a block.  So if on average you are supposed to get one block a day, and it has been a week, then your PoW requirements are drastically decreased.  Also, if you just got a block, your PoW requirements go sky high.  Thus, trying to PoS grind will be difficult, and there is no incentive to waste lots of electricity and hardware to get more blocks quicker.  The difficulty of your PoW would average out to your current hardware, no matter what it is.

If I were working on an alt coin, that would be my main push.  Always look for ways to make it easier to buy sell and trade my alt, and give it more visibility.  I would also start working with existing bitcoin wallet makers to incorporate my altcoin, as well as talking to the owners of localbitcoin.com.  Anything to expand the reach of my alt.
That, however, is no longer the spirit here for bitcoin.  There's way to much animosity.  When's the last time you told someone about bitcoin?  When were you last excited to share the bitcoin experience?  For me, its been over 6 months, because I don't believe bitcoin can scale, and if it can, it will not be able to do it in time to stay its market share.

Price drop is because there is a conflict between "Compact blocks" which is Core's version of what has been released by Bitcoin Unlimited in March called "xthin-blocks".  The conflict is over the enum value, which is used on the network to identify the feature.  The result is a potential disruption of bitcoin's P2P network.  Either Core is using the same enum's on purpose to quash any competition for block compression technology, or it is a simple lack of communication.  In either case, this highlights the community rift and the potential disruptions.  Investors are probably afraid because of this fighting.
If bitcoin is to grow in value, there has to be compromise and communication.  Exclusion of other developers and large block proponents is close to the root of the problem, and needs to be addressed.

The move to hard fork and create a new set of coins is not hostile and would not decrease the combined value of both coins.  The actual decrease started when posts on the other sub pointed out that compact blocks stands to disrupt the P2P network because it uses the same enum as xthin-blocks (implemented by the Bitcoin Unlimited).  Investors are probably looking at the rift and are seeing a concrete example of what can go wrong because of this rift.

Not quite.  Those holding bitcoins at the spinoff would have a vested interest in seeing both bitcoin and the spinoff succeed.  Bitcoin's value would probably be split to some degree, but the value to the cryto at large would benefit the most.

The most important thing is that the fighting could stop.

The real delemma is how do you grow interest in bitcoin when the community has been divided by a stupid issue of block size?  How do you get those who have been shunned to actually care about the future of crypto when they are shut out of speaking their mind?  This is the real problem.  Fix this problem and bitcoin's value will start to rise once again.

Without any scaling, it will not go over around $1000 per coin.  There is simply not enough space for growth in the third world where $.05 is a lot of money.  What's more, people looking at the problem are thinking that without any type of scaling, costs of build infrastructure to take or accept bitcoin is a bad investment, as its potential is limited.  Without a clear path to any type of scaling, businesses will simply not bother taking bitcoin.
Further, without mending the rift between the community members, promotion of bitcoin will be slow, so don't expect the price to go up until we can get everyone together.  Right now there is to much animosity and at least 1/3 of the community is left out.
This is the hard reality of not talking about adding more transactions on the blockchain, even at least temporarily until the LN becomes viable.

The LN is going to introduce centralization as well.  There are far fewer people/business that will be able to have the connections and visibility to become hubs for transaction processing on the LN.

This is only part of the issue.  The root issue is the demoralization of the infighting happening.  This infighting is causing people to not have the willpower to fight against the EU proposals being put forth that will basically quash crypto.  
A compromise between the large and small blockers needs to be reached, and the fighting needs to stop.  Continued fighting is allowing regulation to go unopposed.  If you want to see your bitcoin value grow, we have to unite and put this stupid crap behind us.  Otherwise, adverse regulation WILL get passed and the value WILL fall further.
In short, the infighting has REAL consequences on the value and price of bitcoin.  If you want the value to grow, reach out to those who oppose your position and seek to unite.

In the short term, a small increase in the block size is not going to centralize bitcoin as much as leaving it at 1mb and forcing everyone to go into the LN.  
Right now there are around 6k nodes of various flavors.  However, when people go to find places to transact their coins, they are going to look for recognized names in the bitcoin space.  That number is easily going to be less than 1k.  The human mind can only hold 7 to 9 things at once, and it tends to filter out the alternatives.  Businesses are already being named as possible places to clear transactions.  Consolidation is going to happen with the LN.
Can you show how increasing the block size to 2mb is going to cut 6k by at least half or more?

Really?  The whole point is to have a decentralized system.  If you have centralization, the system will be subject to control, just as control is being exercised via centralization of mining.  This does not even take into account the possibility that those operating as clearing hubs will be attacked like ripple was (via "law enforcement").  Remember that the LN works very similar to ripple in that everyone has to be connected to someone with the ability to clear transactions.  Also remember that Ripple was charged with operating a money transmission operation without a license.  Will that mean the core programmers will also have to get a license?


It's about control and fallback positions.  The block size should at least be coded so that it can be flipped on in short order IF the system gets to congested or if the LN fails to work.
It's also about control.  It's about keeping money free of control while still keeping it secure.  The number of eyes per transaction will decrease in both cases (e.g. continual centralization).  However, in the case of LN, the eyes verifying/handling transactions will drastically decrease. 
Assuming the node count will drop 1k with a 2mb increase and that there are 1k transactions per 1mb of block space, then:
1mb block space verify per transaction:  6k nodes / 1k transactions = 6 nodes per transaction
2mb block space verify per transaction: (6k nodes - 1k nodes lost) / 1k transactions = 5 nodes per transaction
Assuming the transactions increase to 2k, but the block size stays at 1mb, and there are 1k entities verifying transactions on the LN (1k is super generous, because people will look for the strongest player to work with):
1mb block space verify per transaction:  6k nodes / 1k transactions = 6 nodes per transaction
1k transaction nodes verifying 1k remaining transactions: 1k nodes / 1k transactions = 1 nodes per transaction
Average: (6+1)/2 = 3.5 nodes per transaction.
At some point, the balance starts to tip to LN, but that's still in the future.  If anything the LN should be created and developed along with other solutions (my preference being chain splitting with merged mining).  But, increasing the block size is the FIRST low hanging fruit that should not be dismissed.
EDIT: changed "verify per transaction" to "nodes per transaction".

Yep.  That's exactly what is happening.  Alt coins will eat bitcoin's lunch if the core developers are not flexible in their approach.
Both LN and a block size increase should be happening along with other possible solutions.  Dismissing 2mb as a viable way to grow is just stubborn political BS.  2mb even as a fall back in case of a catastrophe is the logical thing to do.  Implement it but don't activate it unless things go sideways.  Or implement it and try it, but soft fork it back to a smaller block when its time to push some of the transactions into the LN.

Please list all the use cases for RBF and explain why it is more important than 0-conf risk assessment.  The one you have listed here does NOT make sense as a good reason for switching to RBF.  The only half valid reason for RBF I've heard is the case of stuck transactions, which is not as important as zero-conf risk estimations, which is solved by the hour wait.

@_date: 2015-12-28 04:52:13
You and I both know the answer to this question.  It's to prevent fraud.  To pose this leading question is to derail the discussion in an attempt to justify RBF.
When you write a check to a business for products, the merchant will accept this check based on the risk of someone "double spending" the check (writing bad checks on amounts that do not exist).  The merchant will accept the check if he can have some ID, and possibly use special devices to verify the funds exist in the account before taking the check, but he still takes the check.
The case of 0-conf is the same thing.  Taking a transaction based on the number of nodes, gives the merchant a way to mitigate the risk of fraud.  
The argument is for the ability to estimate risk.  It's not about eliminating risk entirely.  Naked RBF without a delay increases the risk and destroys the risk estimation.
You know exactly the argument being put forth, yet you use obfuscation to cover over the use case so you can side step a strong valid use case for 0-conf.  This is NOT a philosophical discussion, its about real world cases that have real impacts on bitcoin's future.

False.  Traceablilty is a serious problem for bitcoin.  It threatens the viability of bitcoin because when you receive bitcoins for goods or services and those coins came from a hack or some other illicit source, the exchange will give you a hard time about accepting them.  It means using cash or fiat is easier because those have true fungibility and you will not be hassled if you innocently obtained funds from an illicit source.
Question: When banks receive money that was part of an illegal operation (dollars have serial numbers and you'd be naive to think that banks don't keep track of those serial numbers) do they harass customers or simply give the data to authorities so that they can keep tabs on the activity?  The difference in how exchanges are forced to implement "compliance" shows a bias against bitcoin, because they attack the fungibility of bitcoin.  Some coins are treated differently than others, while dollars are always treated the same.
Claiming fungibility is a veiled apologism is itself a thinly veiled attack on bitcoin.  If bitcoin were like Dart or Monero, you might claim that these mixed coins (that solve fungilibty) are exclusive tools of thieves and illegal activity.  It's a catch 22.  If you allow tractability and exchanges start rejecting/harassing people for having coins that link to illegal activity, then you get to attack bitcoin by making it difficult to use.  If it is mixed automatically, you could attack the coins as being a tool for illegal activity.

You were hacking/messing with their system and they kinda view it it like a bank, not a software system (where people are encouraged to find bugs).  Thus your activity probably looked hostile and alarming, where if you did that to a site that does not have the "compliance/banking" culture, it would have been welcome.

Not the most tech savvy guy, but he may be talking about in the future when the number of transactions are so large, you cannot keep track of them.
If you listen to the whole thing, he's got some interesting takes on what's going to happen unless we get wise.  Basically, he's thinking they (the banks) want to "scrape" percentages on EVERY SINGLE transaction.
This matches perfectly with the war on cash and how casasious (the first physical bitcoin) has been pushed out of the market.  If all the transactions can be put in digital form instead of cash or gold and silver, then they can continual get a cut.  
What we should be doing is fighting harder against the regulations that will provide the banks with yet another monopoly on money, namely those on "digital currencies" that are being pushed at the state level.  This gives the banks choke hold points to skim a percentage or two.

False.  What do you think BitPay is doing? They're looking at the nodes to decide if there's a double spend attack, and taking an educated assessment as to the risk of a double spend.


Correct.  But there's little chance of a miner taking a double spend if he does not know about it.  Screw with those odds and destroys what's a valid use case of zero-conf.


This is within your ability to do, but doing so will make you and the miners who do this pariah of the community.  It will also make people willing to create code to reject blocks that override this convention, and those miners will lose money.  Also, your comments show you to be bull headed and brash which makes me question your actual intentions and if you're simply trying to destroy or retard bitcoin's growth.


It's to late to change this convention.  If you're dead set on this, what will happen is you'll destroy some of bitcoin's value (which may be your intention) or you'll end up with an altcoin.

I agree that it's a potential problem.  The only issue I take with the ability of the bankers to implement laws that can force us to stay in such a system.  As long as such laws don't exist, I'm still in favor of crypto currencies, because bitcoin can be dumped in favor of other flavours.  If the laws and regulations get enacted to block such a move, then its game over for crypto currencies and we end up in the same damn fucking rut.

Making a private blockchain is similar to running a centralized database.  If there is a transaction or data that government wants, you can be sure, that the FBI or other agency is going to be harassing you to either prevent the transaction, freeze the funds, or modify the code so they can reverse the transaction.  You're going to be subject to strict regulation and KYC rules which are going to give you lots of expensive compliance expenses.
Private block chains are only for the rich banks that can deal with compliance or a small group of friends who trust each other.

Ignoring the fact that NY state law does NOT authorize this regulatory agency to regulate bitcoin directly, can someone answer the following?
Someone mentioned running a mining pool would be effected.  How can running a mining pool in say CO get you snared by this (fake) regulation in NY?  The internet is virtual and NY has no jurisdiction in CO.  It would be up to NY to block such a service, not the service's responsibility.  Further, the interstate commerce clause gives the power to regulate commerce between states to the federal government, and not the state governments.  Demanding prosecution of a business in CO because it unwittingly did business with a person in NY is jurisdictional backward.

They may not control it at the moment.  However, with the trillions of dollars of resources, it's not unimaginable that they could create a mining consortium large enough to block all transactions except those who pay a 1% fee.
Also, what I pointed out above is that if regulators can block buisness into banking rules to say classify bitcoin trading as money transmission services, write rules so only their cronies control exchanges in the U.S., and prevent all U.S. businesses from using BitPay and only use U.S. exchanges to turn BTC back into dollars, then they've effectively cornered all the on and off ramps and set up toll booths.

I did some research years ago before SSD's were so cheap.  A storage location on an SSD can sustain something like 3000 write cycles before it starts to deteriorate.  If a typical SSD size is say 200 GB, you'd have to write 600 TB before things start degrading.  If you wrote say 5GB of data every day for the life of your SSD, the lifespan would be something like 400 years.  Also, an SSD is a bit different in how it manages wear limits.  It keeps track of how many times a write has occurred to particular regions of the SSD and will shift the data that is more stationary to parts that have already experienced wear.  Thus the SSD's tend to wear evenly, unlike hard drives that will write to one sector over and over and over, but never move the data to another sector.
Its also worth noting that SSD's do fail at about the same rate as HD's, and they often give no warning they are about to fail.  It is usually do to poor quality control, and not to wear issues.  So, a new SSD is more likely to fail in the first couple of month, but after that, you've got a fairly low probably of problems after that.  HD's on the other hand, tend to fail with more use after the first few months.

From what I'm reading, zero-conf is still dependable enough to provide a good use case.  Modifying the core code to allow fraudsters to change the in-memory transactions at the last minute destroys this zero-conf use case.  You are correct that it will not destroy bitcoin, but it will make people question the value of bitcoin, and the exchange rate will begin to drop as people opt out because of fraud.  It will also introduce an element of doubt as to the security of bitcoin from "bungling" (or intentional sabotage) of a few core developers.

Yes, but what's dangerous is the ease at which a double spend can happen against the average user now.  It makes it impractical to take BTC in brick and mortar stores without BitPay or some other company converting it immediately to dollars.  Usually, you can depend on it being difficult do a double spend on a race condition where the attacker has to propagate his transaction quicker than the one he sent you.  Now the attacker can leave the store and has a few minutes before he can launch a replace by fee that nodes and miners will now accept.  RBF basically enables more fraud and scams for very little benefit.  It basically makes bitcoin less attractive to businesses, because of extra training and keeping track of changes in the bitcoin technology.
If I had a business and the core developers changed this, I would never take bitcoin and hold it.  It would be just to much work and risk for the reward.

Why are opponents continually arguing that transactions can still be changed by the miners?  This is NOT an argument against the 0-conf case.  Merchants have to make up their own mind about this risk.  It is NOT justification for RBF, it's mealy a passive way of obscuring the argument.


And how important is this vs. saving 0-conf risk estimation by brick and mortar shops?  I would say that exchanges are working online, and people are willing to wait for the next block.  An exchange would simply pile up the transactions for the next block.  It's not more important.

If RBF goes into the core nodes, then its going to be much harder for people to trust zero-conf.

[Clipper chip]( - "The Clipper chip was a chipset that was developed and promoted by the United States National Security Agency[1] (NSA) as an encryption device, with a built-in backdoor, intended to be adopted by telecommunications companies for voice transmission. It was announced in 1993 and **by 1996 was entirely defunct**."
"Organizations such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation challenged the Clipper chip proposal, saying that it would have the effect not only of subjecting citizens to increased and possibly illegal government surveillance, but that the strength of the Clipper chip's encryption could not be evaluated by the public as its design was classified secret, and that therefore individuals and businesses might be hobbled with an insecure communications system. Further, it was pointed out that while American companies could be forced to use the Clipper chip in their encryption products, foreign companies could not, and presumably phones with strong data encryption would be manufactured abroad and spread throughout the world and into the United States, **negating the point of the whole exercise, and, of course, materially damaging U.S. manufacturers en route.**"
In other words, we've been here before when the NSA tried to require back doors, and our country suffered for the attempt. 
There is such a thing as "rule of law" and the law (specifically the 4th amendment) says "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,[a] against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.".

1. LocalBitcoins.com or any web service that connects buyers and sellers.
2. Bitcoin "ATM's" that exchange bitcoin for fiat or fiat for bitcoin.
3. Anyone who runs a bitcoin node in NY.
4. Anyone who holds bitcoins for another party.
5. Anyone who sends bitcoins across state lines.
6. People who create Bitcoin cards that hold bitcoin.
What NY CAN regulate with the current laws are:
1. Persons holding dollars to exchange into bitcoin.  (A full bitcoin exchange.)
2. Persons creating cards that hold dollar values that can be converted to bitcoin.
The extent of the current NY law only applies to holding FIAT (for other persons) and issuing instruments (cards, vouchers, etc) denominated in dollars.  The NY law does not apply to instruments NOT backed.  Bitcoin is NOT backed by anything, therefore, much of what this tries to regulate is bunk and needs to be challenged in court and those attempting to write the regulation need to be sued for violating people's freedom, and false arrest, (or whatever measure they attempt to use to stop people from trading bitcoins).

Is this set on or off by default?  What happens if the next core has it set on by default?
There are serious problems with this being put in the core application.  The more nodes that run with RBF, the higher the zero-conf fraud. 
Zero-conf is a valid use case right now because vendors can depend on seeing that enough valid transactions have reached enough nodes as to not be a problem.  However, if RBF is placed on enough nodes, the zero-conf use case goes away.
If this continues to spread, bitcoin is going to lose value because people are going to loose money to zero-conf fraud because they were not aware of the change.  RBF is a threat to adoption, a threat to bitcoin's value.

This is correct.  RBF simply allows a customer to replace a transaction in the mempool.  However, it will impact the value of bitcoin because to many people currently depend on zero-conf, and RBF greatly increases the chances of zero-conf fraud.  Thus, people and business are going to get burned by this fraud, and then dump bitcoin because it is just to expensive to deal with the changing technology.
The current businesses can see if there is a race between a doublespend and wait before releasing goods.  With RBF, there is no race, the fraudster can walk out of the store and then issue a replacement within the 10 minute window with no risk of being caught.  Without RBF, a merchant can see that the majority of nodes accept his transaction and he can be relatively sure the transaction will reach the blockchain.  RBF destroys this method of zero-conf.

The one thing that regulators will always push for is de-anonymizing bitcoin.  The system will always demand perfect information on every individual down to the last Satoshi.  This is probably the only reason that the government has not come down harshly, because bitcoin has massive potential for tracking peoples activities.  Just watch for it and be ready to move on when bitcoin can no longer be private.

If you tell a lie often enough, will people believe you?  We are not into false hope, **we want the truth**, and what we are being told does not make sense.  If you want to paint a scenario where the coins are gone, fine, explain how, based on what we know.
1. No bankruptcy **protection** court is going to take seriously a claim of $61 million in liabilities when there are 700+k missing BTC, so why even try?
2. We CAN see the coins.  We can see the addresses and put things together based on this.  700k missing BTC cannot be explained away by MT.  MtGox has monthly audits.
3. The scribd story was flaky.  [twobitidiot has questioned his sources]( and it appears the pdf was [edited by him]( prior to leaking it.

I think this report is a red herring.  If the coins were in cold storage, you should be investigating when you have to add more coins to your hot wallet.  The only way those trades could make any sense, is if they are simply accounting entries without actually pulling the coins out of storage.  Can the OP see the coins going out of the Gox wallet for the Willy bot?  There should be a pattern on the block chain to back up what he's suggesting.
My gut says that this is just a way to divert us and make us think it was an external hacking job, but because any intellegent exchange operator would want to investigate large amounts of BTC exiting his exchange, I cannot believe that many coins were taken out of GOX without Mark's knowledge.  It would seem more likely that he created the "hack" himself as an accounting trick to "hide" BTC, but not touch the cold storage wallets.
EDIT: After examining the report closer, I retract the "red herring" comment.  The author has don a very in depth examination of both the block chain and the available databases.

Price is important.  But its a chicken and egg problem.  Price increase happens because people see value in it, and the price increase feeds on itself, then as people panic and sell, this also feeds on itself.  What's needed is a broader base of buyers and sellers so that the more level headed people will stabilize things.  But that takes more interested people.  But the bigger the swing the less likely people will adopt.
We are already starting to see more rational swings.  It's taken weeks to fall this low, whereas previous percentage swings happened in hours.  We just need to keep encouraging people to buy only a small mount and not to get greedy so that when there are price drops, the swings are not as bad.

It's the reporting issue that's a problem.  In 1933, the U.S. government took people's gold back when the money supply was tight.  This eliminated an alternative currency that was needed to compete with the dollar.  If the government knows you have bitcoins, they've just got half the battle for thwarting this alternative currency.  They'll just wait for some event and use it as justification for taking the coins (by force).
Also, the reporting issue gets at bitcoin's privacy, because now you have to report all transactions.  Who want's to report all their purchases to the IRS?  People will opt for cash instead of bitcoin, simply because of the reporting requirements.
This is in no way a good thing.  It is a subtle attack on bitcoin that is being sold to bitcoiner's as a "good thing" when it is anything but good news.

Did you know that the great depression of the 1930's was caused by "regulation" that tightened the money supply after years of vast expansion of the money supply?  Did you know that the government directive to outlaw the ownership of gold only worsened this by taking gold (as a source of alternative currency) out of circulation?  Did you know that prior bubbles and bank runs paled in comparison to the 1930's mismanagement of money?
I would argue that the more recent catastrophes were an un-willingness of those administering the system to go after fraudulent activities.  The fraud was well known way before the 2008 crash.

The Federal Reserve system was enacted in 1913, and gold was still used despite the paper dollar (backed by fractionally reserved silver conversion).  In 1933, in the midst of the depression, [Executive Order 6102]( took away gold by decree (not by an act of congress, but rather by dictate) from circulation.  This while currency in general was hard to obtain because of the tightening of the money supply by the Federal Reserve.  In other words, the dollar was forced on the American public by taking away another alternative currency.
Further in 1965, production of all silver coins stopped and in 1971 Nixon stopped the conversion of dollars to silver. In other words he stopped redeeming dollars for silver, probably because of the fractional reserve of silver to dollars.  E.G. the U.S. government could not cover all the requests for silver.


Gold and silver would have a much higher value if it were used as a means of exchange.  Some estimate silvers value at 100x it's current value if it were to start mass adoption, because it has been slowly consumed by industrial uses.  If gold and silver bugs were to do a grass roots campaign like the bitcoin community has, they would get the same rise in value.

Point taken.  However, in the scheme of things, 3% can be a reasonable amount for a "hot wallet".


Based on how the NSA and other 3 letter agencies push to make software and hardware vulnerable, and the potential threat bitcoin represents to governments, I think it is reasonable to be paranoid of your systems security.  I'm very paranoid of my computer's security (not my Window's system... that's a lost cause).  I'm always thinking about how my coins can be taken or what potential threat exists.  
My take on Coinbase... if they're being paranoid about security, I trust them more.  It may be inconvenient, but what's a few days in the bigger scheme of things.  Hell, it takes 2 or 3 days to verify security for a bank transfer, or 7 days to mail a check, and a few more days to have it clear.

Not likely.  With the various sources I've read, it's clear Gox is going to be taken down.  But the way this is all happening makes me suspicious that is engineered in some way.  The [scribid]( pdf is so flaky that it looks like extra spin to the [blockchain.info]( and [coinbase.com]( statements.  The reason the scribd.com pdf is so strange is because there's supposedly only 2k of BTC left in their exchange.  How can you get down to 2k BTC with 700k+ outstanding?
My take on all this is that someone has either forced GOX to give up their coins or they were hacked from the inside.  The conspiratorial view is that this is the engineered "problem".  The "reaction" will be panic.  The solution will be floated as "regulation".  If you want to call me crazy, that's fine... just remember what John Perkins had to say in is ["Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"](  These powerful interests are not going to let bitcoin become a player.  There's just to much money and power involved.
Whatever happens, don't take the "regulation" bait.  Simply start looking for alternatives to centralized exchanges and finding ways to verify the fund that are in existing exchanges.

Been trying to point this out to people.  If you are exchanging bitcoins (buying below the exchange rate, and selling above the exchange rate) you are providing a service and if you do it often enough, you are probably going to run afoul of the transmission laws unless your transactions are small enough.
If, however, you are an individual who is either liquidating your position or buying a new position and you are working at the exchange rate and not playing both the bid and asked rate, and not making a profit on the difference, then you are not a money transmission service.  You are simply an individual who is buying or selling for his own use.
Basically, you are not a service if you are not profiting by playing both sides of an exchange, you are simply an individual looking to buy bitcoins for your own use or for long term capital gains, or you are liquidating your position to reap long term gains.
The best way to avoid this snare is to not play both sides for a profit.  For example, there is a bitcoin seller in my town that sells above the exchange rate, but he does NOT buy.  From this perspective, he's not a money transmitter, he's an individual who's slowly liquidating his BTC for the best possible price.  You could do the same on the buy side by offering to buy below the exchange rate, so long as you are not also selling at or above the exchange rate and profiting from the difference.
Basically, it a legal snare.  Just don't get greedy when using localbitcoins.com and try to play both buyer and seller for a profit on the difference or you'll end up being classified as an unlicensed money transmitter, and legal nightmares will ensue.

There are a few things that worry me about changing the status of bitcoin from property to "currency" with regards to taxation.  First is the annual taxation of currency fluctuation as income.  "Income" is taxed at a higher rate.  Second is that if it is changed from property to currency, the IRS will be "all up in your business" demanding to know if you have virtual currencies.  This destroy's any hope of privacy with regards to Bitcoin.  You would either have to violate the tax laws to protect your privacy, or tell the world/IRS what you own.
While I can understand that people want to avoid the headaches of tracking each purchase for the purposes of capital tax, can we agree that the real problem is income and capital gains tax?  Either way is going to be a disadvantage to bitcoin. 
(BTW, go search youtube for Aaron Russo's "Freedom to Fascism" to get a little taste of how people are trying to find the laws justifying the income tax.)

All regulation of Bitcoin is going to be wrong, because it will use violence to stop people from doing that which is their right to do.  Instead they will insist that people ask for "permission" when none is really required, except that guns will be used if you don't ask for "permission".

Federal investigators don't really want the truth, they simply want it to be true that there was fraud so they can get attention.  We are already tracking at lease 200k BTC tied to an addressed owned by MtGox, and given that there was a monthly audit on Gox funds, and Gox had KYC controls in place for super large withdrawals, it is not feasible that the funds were lost over a long period of time.  In order for the exchange to lose that much over 4 or 5 years, they would have to hemorrhage something like 4-500 BTC per day, and a monthly audit would not miss this.
Prosecutors should be looking at the bias of [Ryan Selkis]( and his bias connections to the financial sector to determine if there is any merit to this "leak", and if it turns out the document was doctored (and he does not admit it), then they should be charging him with falsifying evidence in a criminal investigation.
What seems much more likely is that the private keys to these funds has been corrupted or lost.

From a prior post:
I'm still trying to figure out all the angles.  The scribd document was "leaked" by [Ryan Selks]( (with heavy ties to the financial sector... including JP Morgan).  The chat that supposedly supported the theory that Gox is insolvent was posted by "Jon Fisher" according to [coindesk.com](  I cannot seem to find much on this Jon Fisher... only that he's ["an industry consultant based in New York"](  The New York part is interesting because...
1. Talk of financial reguation is happening in New York.
2. SecondMarket is preparing to launch a Bitcoin exchange in New York.
3. CEO of Mt.Gox is being summoned to New York.
Theory:  Mark was made an offer for Mt.Gox and that offer is on the table.  Gox cannot talk about the offer or his solvency or insolvency.  The shit storm that is going on is being created to force a lower buyout price, and those "leaks" are part of a strong arm tactic.  The insolvency, if real, is not as bad as the scribd document describes.
In any case, this all reaks of banking/financial insiders trying to get the jump on bitcoin trading and to set up barriers to competition via regulation in the bitcoin space.

Depends on the currency.  In 1933, Roosevelt issued executive order 6102 that took gold out of circulation, at a time when the Federal Reserve was tightening the money supply (when people needed alternatives to the dollar).  The dollar was fractionally reserved based on silver in 1913 based on the Federal Reserve act, so paper dollars (not the coins) were fractionally reserved and could be converted to silver coins.  In 1965, minting of silver coins stopped, and in 1971, Nixon stopped the redemption of dollars into silver.  So, in essence, by deception and by force, the unbacked fiat dollar was made the "de-facto" national currency.

At the moment, this is true.  But if your point is to argue for regulation, don't.  Bitcoin ATM's will fill the gap for the average person ($0-$1000).  No matter what the average user knows, anyone dealing with over $1k needs to do his homework or seek professional help to store and deal with bitcoin.  Bitcoin is NOT designed to be a bank, and just as the average user will have to worry about physical security of gold or silver, the same worries apply to bitcoin holdings.
Banking regulation has made everyone trust the banks, but that blind trust regulated trust has come at a very high cost to everyone in society as a whole.  What people need is to grow up and take more responsibilities for their wealth.  Bitcoin is a high risk "investment" at the moment, and only those who understand those risks should be involved in bitcoin on a large scale.

It's not just about fund lost.  It's about an exchange looking at the history of coins given to them.  It means that as more people face hassles with exchanges refusing coins, the less valuable bitcoin will become.
Imagine you're a business that takes bitcoins for gold, and someone buys gold with bitcoin and leaves your store.  You then go to an exchange, and the exchange questions the origin of your coins and refuses to let you cash out until you prove it.  Are you going to continue to take bitcoin next time?!?
Imagine that you want to buy 10 BTC and you cannot use an exchange, but you know about Bitstamp's behavior.  You extrapolate that you now have to be careful about taking coins from people you don't know for fear of tainted coins.  This makes transaction questionable because the coins you take may be tainted by some illegal activity that exchanges will refuse to deal with.

The blockchain would not go away, but rather it would be unavialable until computers were restored to operation.  Also, if you have a recognized and trusted party making the bitcoin, you could trust the physical just as much as you trust the green pieces of paper issued by the Federal Reserve.


They will if they become popular.


If physical bitcoins become popular, white listing moot.  A physical bitcoins trade history is truly unknowable.


At some point, you've got to trust.  Even when you accept bitcoins over the network, there's about a 20 to 30 minute window of trust, where you risk double spend.  Also, the trust is very vulnerable.  All it takes is one physcial coin to show up with no electronic coins in it to destroy that trust.

Just a side note.  There's a theory about using silver as money, and how it would potentially push the value of silver up over 100 times.  The theory goes on about how some large portion of silver has been consumed in industrial uses where recovering the silver is simply not worth the effort.

You initially did not distinguish between coin mixing ("tumbing") and Money Laundering, and the downvotes were deserved.  Your edit somewhat clarified your stance, but still did not retract the implied equation between coin mixing ("tumbling") and Money Laundering.  If your intent was to make a point about the mechanics to begin with, you are doing a poor job.  If your intent was sophistry in an attempt to paint bitcoin as a tool only for criminals, then it was a pretty good attempt.
My take on all this...  Bitcoin and any crypt currency will never be as useful to real criminals as cash even with mixing.  There are just to many ways to analyse the data and track large volumes of value floating through the data streams.  That being said, there are still good arguments that coin mixing will provide enough privacy for the non-criminals who are doing lower volumes of cash, and where analysis would not be worth 3 letter agency investigations.  This is how it should be.  Our lives should not be open books for government agencies, but the agencies should have enough to go on to point them in the right direction, and enough for valid court order warrants.

Centralization invites the aberration of psychopathy.  It substitutes depending on people around you via empathy giving and sharing.  A society that depends on centralized government or systems to take care of its poor fails to exercise the empathetic part of the human psyche and results in the world we currently have. It specializes the craft of warfare, psychological warfare, subversion, and such.  People in such societies tend to be shielded from the horrors that their warrior and elite classes wage on the rest of the world.

Theoretically, current hard drives and internet can handle 2k per second, but have you ever watched your CPU usage when the bitcoind (or QT) clients have not been online for a while?  With an SSD, my CPU runs at maximum capacity trying to index all the transactions for two weeks.  As more transactions are added, this is only going to get worse.
Bandwidth, storage, CPU usage and hashing pools usage will decentralize bitcoin.  Centralization will lead to control points.  Control points will allow corrupt governments to use green addresses and block any transactions they don't like.

We just have to be willing to burn Bitcoin's reputation to the ground if we don't get the privacy we demand.

The "undercover agent" claims to have told the sellers that they were dealing in stolen credit cards.  There's no indication as to how they were told and the circumstances of the actual bitcoin transactions.  This is basically suggesting that the sellers were willing to exchange funds even when the funds could reasonably be considered part of criminal activities.  This is basically money launderng, and you have to be careful.  What may seem like innocent banter and you may not think anything of it ("That's his business, I'm just selling him bitcoins."), may actually be assisting in criminal activity.  The simplest way to avoid this is to just tell them, "I'm sorry.  I don't know if you were joking about X but since X is a crime, I can no longer work with you."

**Speculation and filling in the gaps is very appropriate when things don't make sense.**  There's good reason to question twobit's document, and this is NOT about manipulating the value of gox coins.  It's about trying to find out what happened, based on things that don't make sense.
1. In order for Gox to lose 755K BTC reported by twobitidiot, gox would have to hemorrhage something like 4-500 BTC per day since 2011.  The [Charlie Sherm]( interview revealed that Gox has a monthly audit, and such a loss would soon be discovered, way before 2014.
2. twobitidiot's real name is [Ryan Selkis]( and he has connections to the financial sector, including JPMorgan.  He's also the founder of an insurance company for cryptocurrencies.  "We're like the FDIC for Bitcoin."  So creating chaos is in his best interest so he can sell his services.
3. Signing messages with a private key that matches a public address is fairly prof positive that an address is owned and controlled by that entity or person.  Also, tracking coins via multiple addresses to a single address is fairly accurate.  We've stated before to governments and regulators that cash is far more private than the blockchain, and trying to hide 700+k BTC is kinda impossible if you have a group of deposit address to examine.
In short, we can be wrong, but we pretty much know twobitidiot's document is either doctored or outright fake.

Even if they are insolent, there's a good chance they can cover 80-90% of the BTC.  The problem is that if they default, it could take years to recover a percentage of the outstanding BTC.  Also, since they are making like .5% for each trade, the amount of thrashing would probably give them enough margin to cover existing losses.
It all really boils down to this:
1. MtGox is honest but incompetent.  Little or no money will be lost and Gox will be able to cover their mistakes.
2. MtGox is honest, but has lost to much to be solvent and is afraid to let everyone know.  Lots of money will be lost, because of bankruptcy.  It may take years to recover the funds.
3. MtGox appears to be incompetent, but is really scamming everyone.  All money will be lost, when the owner skips town.
4. MtGox is incompetent but is taking advantage of the price difference between its exchange and other exchanges to cover its BTC shortage.  Only those who sold will lose money, but those that bought BTC will win.
The interesting thing is that if they are doing 4, they could push the up price of BTC on their exchange by "buying" BTC on their exchange, selling it on other exchanges, moving the money back to their exchange and repeating the process until they have enough to cover any shortage.

Two factors here.  1. I could be untrustworthy and take the private key when making the "coin", 2. I could be incompetent in creating a good paper wallet that is tamper proof.  If I'm good at number 1, but not at number 2, then only the first person I trade with would value the "coin", because the next people getting it would question if its been tampered with.  In order to create a good tradable "coin" its got to meet both problems sufficiently so that everyone would accept it as "just as good as electronic".

Nothing so long as the person in control is not corrupt.  When you start rotating in new people, you are bound to introduce corrupt elements.  Just look to the Bitcoin Foundation as an example.  Every time you bring on a new person, (especially when there's a lot of money or control involved) the worst people tend to be attracted to the position.  If the current MOD is not censoring stuff and he's been around a long time, chances are he's a benevolent dictator, and he should stay the BDFL (benevolent dictator for life).
If people think this is a problem we should start looking at the systems (centralized systems of discussion) where "admin's" are needed.  I would prefer such a decentralized system over reddit, bitcoin wiki, or bitcointalk, but its silly to boot an "admin" just because he has a lot of "power" and invite someone else who's likely to be corrupt and attracted to that position of power.  If we want decentralized control, you need to design systems of decentralization, not pretend the current system is decentralized and boot someone who's not causing a problem.

If you understand this history of U.S. money and the limitations placed in the constitution, then you also understand that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 represents a coop against the rule of law called the constitution.  It has since indebted the U.S. ([along with many other nations]( and has forced wars to defend the value and to defray the inflationary effects of government spending on foreign nations.  We here in the U.S. are living large (relatively speaking), not because of hard work (although we are actually prevented through various regulation and compliance rules from working in a lot of industries), but rather through a strong dollar supported by the labor of other nations because those nations need dollars to purchase oil.  This is the ugly monetary policy that is not discussed.  This is the truth of the current system of finance.  This is why the we need to realize our power and shun the current system in favor of alternatives.

The original Casascius were NOT simply wallets.  They were recognizable units of bitcoins.


This is true up to the point at which someone shows the trust has been broken.  The trust in physical bitcoins is VERY fragile because they can be verified.  Bad or incompetent actors would soon be discovered and pushed out of the market.  Only the trustworthy actors would be able to create and sell physical bitcoins at a premium.

We can see the coins.  These have not been stolen by MT.  1.) Gox has KYC controls in place for anything that large, and 2.) they have monthly audits.  The only way those coins are "stolen" is if someone physically took control of the keys from Mt.Gox.  Also, no bankruptcy court would take a protection case with that many coins stolen.  Finally, we have at least one statement that supports the theory that the [cold storage is stored offsite]( (if you believe the user and if you believe Gonzague Gay-Bouchery).  Further the main stream media is not vetting it sources.  Fox called the owner of wickedfire.com an "industry insider".  The original scribd said that Gox only has 2k BTC, but we can see an address dating back to 2011 with well over 100k.

Also, I would think there would be a pattern in the block chain to support these Willy bots pulling BTC out of Gox.  I don't have the programming skills to investigate, the pattern should be there if the OP is right.

Just advocate against it (post comments) and point out how bitcoin does not help criminals and why we should not help associate with criminals.  There is no "self regulation", rather just discourage its use in criminal activities with words.
It's sorta like the gun rights advocates.  They have their own culture shaped by people who think about the political implications of what they say.  If you hang out with a gun rights group, and joke about doing something clearly criminal, you'll find yourself ostracized or at least excluded from many circles.  They understand the dangers of associating with those who advocate using guns for criminal activities and want no part of it.
This is the type of culture that is needed if you want to be perceived as legitimate, and it is done by discouraging illegal activities or even talking about using bitcoin for illegal activities.

Reports are floating around that because secp256k1 was used instead of secp256r1, that Satoshi was a government CIA actor.  secp256r1 was discovered to be back doored by NIST/NSA and only a handful of people would have known this  (CIA and NSA are having a turf war).  It also throws into question the secp256k1 encryption.  The site that hosts the secp256k1 is down (  I can't find the source, but there was a report some time ago where China was warning that the Bitcoin encryption was backdoored by the U.S. government.  Basically there's fear that the long term potential of bitcoin is limited.
We're going to have to provide different encryption options in bitcoin so that if one is broken or back doored, the coin loss is limited.  Using a pre-computed ECDSA numbers provided by a 3rd party is going to be questionable, as the NSA has proven this is a way to break or weaken the encryption.  I've been saying for some time: Bitcoin will drive computer security.

Exactly.  But say you want to buy a lot of bitcoins or you need to liquidate a lot of bitcoins.  If you place an ad to sell at the exchange rate, then you can't really be a service because you are not profiting on your purchases or sales.  You're just a buyer that wants to buy in or a seller who wants to cash out... you're not doing it for a percentage exchange.  Also, you could pay the 10% to someone else and they might be considered a money transmitter, but you're just a "customer" taking a 10% hit to buy in or liquidate.

Basically, the IMF/UK/US/Nato were looking to get a toehold in Ukraine and when the prior president declined a deal and sided with Russia on a loan, the US government fomented an overthrow and destabilized Ukraine.

The U.S. has an ideal constitution, but because the country is so economically powerful, the government can  spend lots more on police, surveillance, and prisons.  Also, since there is so much power, those administering the law often write lots of things that skirt the original intent of the constitution and the bill of rights.

We absolutely need tumblers.  Privacy is important, not because of tax evasion, drugs, or for "aiding and abetting" criminals, but rather because of:
1. Fungibility - If you cannot be sure that the coins are not tied to something illegal.  Its not that you are going out of your way to sell things to criminals, but rather that criminals simply buy things just like the rest of us.  If we have to worry about big brother every time you end up with tainted coins. 
2. Physical security - If you cannot pay people without worrying about robbery because they analyse the bitcoin chain, then bitcoins becomes useless.  Take for instance, paying from your $20k stash.  If the person you are paying gathers that information, then you could become a target for physical violence.
3. Asset protection - Registering coins can mean government confiscation.  This has happened in the past with gold.  We have to make a point that tax evasion is not a legitimate reason for government to know how many bitcoins you have, because government has become immoral in the past.  Governments can be bad actors, and there are very legitimate reasons to not trust government.
Also, we should note that the bills in our wallets are much less traceable than the bitcoins that flow through the internet.  Even if the coins are mixed, analysis by 3 letter agencies will find it 100 times easier to see what is happening than if cash, gold or silver are used.  The mixing that the computers can do will provide enough privacy for the average person, provide fungibility, and asset protection, but still give government agencies plenty of number crunching that will catch any terrorist stupid enough to use bitcoins.
Also, remember that regulators have tried this catch 22 on us before.  If you claim that Bitcoins can give people privacy, then they'll claim that it can be used for illegal activities.  If you claim that it is traceable, then they'll say it need regulation to protect people's privacy.  It's a no-win, unless you point out that the regulators are looking for any excuse.  Basically, there is NO VALID excuse for bitcoin regulation, other than the simple desire to CONTROL.

I'm tired of the governments overzealous persecution of drug use.  Drug use needs to be treated as a health issue.  Also, people need to realized that Silk Road (while illegal) had some advantages that helped decrease the negative impacts of drug use.  Namely: 
* Direct violence - If drugs are purchased online, the users don't face the risk of violence.
* Less theft due to drug use - If drugs are cheaper, then there is going to be less robberies by addicted users to obtain their fix.
* Less dangerous drugs - Silk Road (from what I understand) had a rating system.  If the drugs distributed were of poor quality, they would get a negative review.  This obviously helps drive the poor quality drugs out that can contain much more harmful contaminates.

So, just a thought.
Remember how the Mexican militias simply ignored gun registration in Mexico to fight of the drug lords.  Eventually, the local officials gave in and deputized the militias, giving them better weapons and gear to fight the drug lords.
Also remember how states are ignoring the Federal prohibition with regards to marijuana laws, and now the DOJ is backing off on prosecuting these dispensaries, and how congress is now considering rescheduling?
Well, I propose we do the same.  Simply violate the stupid laws coming out of New York and do we must to spread bitcoin and currency alternatives.  Government and governing bodies will have no choice but to jump in front of the change in order to appear to be in control.  In other words, the power of government is the illusion that they have the authority, and if we ignore it, they have no other choice but to go along to appear to be in control.

Let us remember that the Federal government has bailed out the banks twice, and to the tune of at least several **trillion** dollars last time.  So even though these banks were "regulated" they still failed, and the "consumer" (read U.S. tax payer) was on the hook for these failures.  The children of the U.S. will pay for these debts.
Regulation will be **worse than useless**.  It will be harmful.  Those who deal in bitcoin need to ultimately be responsible for their actions, unlike the "regulated" banks who get a "get out of jail" free card along with all sorts of funding to cover their losses.


If Tom Carper wants to make a better environment for business and U.S. taxpayers, he should work on cleaning up the existing banking system so that it competes with bitcoin and people would opt out of bitcoin in favor of dollar.  Make the existing dollar and banking system so robust that bitcoin has no reason to exist.  Change the existing banking laws so that the banks cannot get away with fraud and inflate the money at the expense of the consumer.  Or better yet, encourage states to create their own public banks that compete with the private for profit banks, so the states can fund their public works.
**Tom Carper, you are not really welcome in this space until you can prove you're capable of running the existing system more effectively than the bitcoin system.**

Sounds cool, but you assume that there are not people holding and/or providing services and products with the intent of hording bitcoins.  As long as there are no true believers, then yes your theory works, but there are enough true believers that are willing to continually buy small amounts continually, or are willing to sell services, and products without converting to cash, that the price will stabalized.
In fact, there's a lot of posts here on that are trying to shake the foundation of this believe in bitcoin.  Your's is a perfect example.  It strikes at the "you're going to lose all your money, because bitcoin will fail, and you'll be laughed at for such a crazy idea".  However, there are people like me who think "I don't care what people think, I'm here to hoard these things, because I want to strike fear into the current money system.  I can either toss my money after bitcoins that may be dropping in value at the moment, or I can hold dollars and watch as those dollars are used to bomb other countries and extract everyone's wealth."

Are any of the allegations that Bitstamp demands proof of where the coins came from before releasing them true?  If so, I would have difficulty proving the source of my coins.  I bought back in 2011 from Gox before Mark took over, and my Gox account no longer exists.  Since its been over 3 years, my bank no longer has that record.  Also, given that I use local trading and I like to mix my coins before trading them (its dangerous if people can see how many coins you hold).  We should be VERY concerned if Bitstamp is not releasing funds because we cannot prove the source.
If the reports are true, we should boycott Bitstamp, and find alternatives.  If on the other hand the reports are not true, then yes we should call "bullshit" and ask for proof.

You should.  It cuts to the core of fungibility.  The FBI has already claimed it can seize coins linked to crimes.

I really think the key for these Satoshi Square situations is that people are there to buy and sell bitcoins.  Those that hang around day in and day out both buying and selling for a profit are probably going to run afoul of the law.
I know one seller in my city that only sells bitcoins at a 10% markup.  He does not sell much, but since he's only selling, he could simply say that he's looking for the best price possible to liquidate bitcoins that he holds. (The argument is a little more tenuous, but still plausible.)  As long as he does not offer to buy (or purchase from an exchange), then he's not playing both sides for a profit, he's simply slowly liquidating his stock.

If a business takes $10k from you in BTC and then tries to cash out followed by lots of hassles with regards to the source of the BTC, then that business will dump bitcoin in a heartbeat.
We need to address this now and dump the exchanges that are causing problems before it becomes the norm and bitcoin is suffocated.

I agree, it is preferable to have multiple medium's of exchange.  But if you are advocating for just one, I'm starting to think gold and silver are going to be superior, and we should abandon bitcoin.  The only advantage bitcoin would have without a physical counterpart is that it is deflationary and thus the promoters profit by seeing it used.  It's tractability, vulnerability to electronic disruption, and hacking make it undesirable as a widely used system of exchange.


Good plan.

What if you want to make a new crypto currency block chain but you don't want to compete with bitcoin's value?  The idea is to create the new protocol, that issues coins into existence only if bitcoins are burned at a particular address in the existing blockchain.  Coins are burned in the old blockchain, and the same number of new coins are created into the new block chain.  Thus the number of coins stays the same.
... At least this is my understanding.

The whole "someone could use it to support terrorism" is a sham.  It really takes state actors to make any real effective terrorist group.

It really takes someone on par with say Bill Gates to fund something like ISIS.  Look at the current drug money flowing through Mexico. So, to say we need money controls on bitcoin is a fucking lie, because:
1. The current controls don't work.
2. And if there were real controls, tracking that much money in Bitcoins is going to be a hell of a lot easier than existing controls.

While this sounds like a victory, your pursuit of your original bitcoins can mean trouble for bitcoins in general.  If merchants fail to deliver on their promise, the risk of accepting bitcoins is by far higher because they would have to go back into the market and purchase those coins back.  
Imagine the following:
Your biz takes BTC and converts to cash to deliver on an item that takes 2 months to build.  2 months go by and due to circumstances beyond your control, you cannot deliver.  Now the price of BTC is now 10x what it was, and your customer is now suing you for your failure to deliver, and now you must deliver the original position back.
If this type of scenario becomes common, business would shy away from a volatile currency like BTC simply because they risk to much.

The current price has a built in premium.  E.G. the expected future value based on speculation and current growth of adoption.  When the expectation of future usefulness or anything that impacts the rate of adoption changes, the price shoots up or plummets because there's a lot of expectation (predictions on future use).  I suspect that the organic value (the value of actual goods and services that bitcoin buys on a year to year basis) is probably much less that $200.  But because of this built in valuation based on expected future use, trying to predict where it will be in say 1 to 5 years based on previous price is difficult.  **It's like trying to predict future predictions.**
A better method would be to try and find the exponent that defines the rate of ~~use~~ growth that is not tied to price and then try to estimate the amount of goods and service that have been purchased with bitcoin at a point in time.  From there its just simple exponential arithmetic.
For example, find the rate of increase in subscriptions, or use google trends to find the rate of "bitcoin" search, the number of users on the bitcointalk bulletin board, or the number of transactions in the block chain.  That gives you the exponent.  Next you could try to estimate the volume of goods and services by picking a point in time and look at the number of bitcoins moved in a day and estimate what percentage are for actual goods at services.  This estimate times 365 is the organic value (e.g. the value if there were no built in speculation on future value).  Note that national currencies have about the same value as their nation's yearly GDP.  So if a nation's GDP is $14 trillion, the amount of money in the system is worth around $14 trillion.  Yearly use ≈ value of currency.  From there just calculate forward the future organic value based on the exponent and the estimated historical (or current) organic value.
Here's a hypothetical calculation:
Let's say I look at bitcointalk and find it's use base has grown at around .5 % per day.
r=1.005 (per day)
Let's also say that around the first of this year the average value of bitcoins moved in the blockchain is around $150m.  We'll estimate that only about 1% of those transactions are for goods and services.  That gives us $1.5 million in sales per day or $.55 billion per year.  That would put bitcoin's organic value at around $.55 billion at the first of the year.  Divide that by 11 million coins issued and you get...
ov = $50 (organic value around first of the year)
From there its just simple calculations.  If you want to find the organic value at the end of 2014, just do this...
fov = $50 * 1.005 ^ 365 = $309
Or if you want to calculate 3 years...
fov = $50 * 1.005 ^ (365 * 3) = $11,770
Anyhow, that's how I do my ballpark future valuation of bitcoin.

The boom of the 1920's and the following bust of the 1930's were a direct result of the newly formed Federal Reserve system.  This is a poor example of regulation and does not justify regulatory tampering with Bitcoin.  Further, in the 1930's the money supply was to constricted (again because of the Fed's policies) and Roosevelt used [Execute Order 6102]( to confiscate American's gold.  This is truly a nasty trick, given that the money supply was already tight, and gold represented an alternative to the fractional reserve paper dollars.  In other words Roosevelt did the worst thing possible in a constricted money situation, he removed more money from the system (the gold alternative).

Not really.  "Do you want to use dollars where everything is safe and regulated (at a slight 2% loss in value), or do you want to use this risky and hard to use bitcoin money that is un-regulated."
People who want the "security" would opt for dollars.  In fact, that is exactly what most businesses who accept bitcoin do.  They convert to dollars at the point of sale.  They will not argue that bitcoin needs to be regulated, rather they simply use the existing regulated system.

This means that its no longer taboo to give police and say the IRS data that the NSA has gathered and stored.  Imagine the IRS now using this data to claim you have $10 M worth of bitcoin and starts linking your online supposedly anonymous posts with your attitude toward taxes.  If they ever pull you into court, they'll pull up all your prior posts.

Nope.  The protocol for bitcoin needs to go slow, and putting pressure on the development team is likely to end in disaster.  If anything, investment teams should be looking at developing other crypto currencies that would fit the bill.  Bitcoin's DNA is fairly set in stone at this point, and fucking is NOT a good idea.  The best that can happen is that 3rd parties find ways to do off chain transactions through some sort of trusted mechanism.  Then more creative use of bitcoins can be used.

For what it's worth, I think there were two mistakes.  The first was the mailability issue.  The second is my speculation that he lost the private keys to the gox BTC.  The reason I don't think the first mistake caused the loss of 700+k of BTC is it's just near impossible to not notice that much funds disappearing from gox.  Also, if there were some people taking advantage of the malleability bug, they would be caught unless they were at the anonymous level (e.g. less that $1k withdrawal per day).  Its simply implausible in my mind that 700k BTC can be eaten up so quickly without a paper trail.

It's NOT low cost.

Can I be convicted for buying a car from someone who I know will use the money to buy drugs?  No...
Can I be convicted for selling a car to someone who I know will use the car to transport drugs?  Head shops sell bongs and other drug paraphernalia all the time, and these activities are legal.
There's also the issue of specific knowledge and use.  If I bought a house to someone who was a drug addict, I can suspect that all the money would go to drugs, but there's the possibility that the money can be used for other things.  Head shops work in this way as well.  They can sell this stuff because things like bongs can be used for other things like legal tobacco.  On the other hand, if someone is buying a car from me and they specifically say that they are going to use it for hauling drugs, the wise thing to do is to alert the authorities.  It's all a question of reasonable suspicion that the transaction could facilitate crime and the severity of the crime.
If someone walks into a gun shop and makes a poor joke about kidnapping his ex, the proprietor would probably ask that person to leave and never come back.  If you were examining a device in a head shop that could be used to hide stuff, and you specifically asked the owner if it could hold weed, he would probably say something like "Well, it can hold ten rolled up objects, but what those objects might be is for you to decide."
We can already see that Shrem closed his business in attempts to comply with the money laws, so it is clear that he was doing what was required to meet the onerous regulatory requirements.  So, this would go against the prosecutor's case that Shrem was willfully violating the law.   (Proof of intent is required for criminal cases.)  So, it kinda boils down to how the prosecutor can sell the jury on intent.  What would a reasonable person would do, and was his actions consistently in attempting to side step the law to facilitate drug trades?  Based on his actions, it seems that Shrem was doing what he could to follow the law when he was made aware of the (onerous) regulations regarding currencies.  These are not the actions of someone who is attempting to willfully violate the law.

I've come across this idea several times.  The idea has two aspects to it.  A dark aspect (which most people attribute to the idea), and a light aspect.  The light aspect revolves around what a soldier is willing to give his or her life for.  If you are part of the military and have volunteered, then you're not going to be willing to sacrifice yourlself and to see your fellow soldiers die for a narcacistic immoral population, thus your will to fight is diminished.  However, if you are fighting for a moral, just, and good natured society against a other soldiers who have not really thought about why they are fighting, or why they are following orders, then, yes, might is right, because the soldiers who know why they are fighting are generally going to be better fighters.  The other forces are more likely to run because they are "de**moralized**".

Possible, but the address dates back to 2011, the malleability issue was only pronounced in the last 2 weeks or so.  If the hemorrhaging was happening since 2011, then the average hemorrhaging had to be something like 400+ BTC per day.   That all still seems so unlikely since Gox has KYC rules in place for large withdraws.  Further is that there were many fewer coins in existence back in 2011, so losing 400+ BTC per day back in 2011 would still represent a significant percentage of GOX reserves.  Finally, a [Charlie Shrem]( interview revealed that Gox had monthly audits.  400+ missing BTC per day would be a difficult thing to miss in a monthly audit.

I think "Roboco(p/ion)" is rubbing our noses in the coming surveillance of bitcoin.  From one of the other articles, using this "system" you can "send" bitcoin's to a phone number, but then the person "receiving" the coins has to "log in" (e.g. provide all sorts of information including biometric and stool samples).  It seems to be a clear strategy to turn the difficult things of bitcoin into a convince if you provide all sorts of personal information.  I for one will refuse any payments from these machines if I have to give any sort of private or biometric information.

Everything is being geared toward a surveillance society.  "Money Laundering" laws are used as an excuse to have instant access to what we spend and where, Casascius was accused of being a money transmitter, so we cannot have a physical bitcoin (like cash), and the NSA continues to scarf up all internet data (because we need to keep you safe).  If people don't wake up to this tactic, this is how cryptocurrencies will wither and die.  The state (governments) will convince people that this is all necessary, and the only advantage bitcoin has (anonymity and control of your funds) will disappear.
Why would you want to use bitcoin if:
* The government knows how many bitcoins you have and can throw you in jail if you don't relinquish them?
* You cannot leave the country without raising red flags for having bitcoins.
* You cannot send coins to organizations that oppose the status quo (which should be a basic human right) without provoking an FBI file, and possibly a visit from a "friendly" agent.
Bitcoin is going to become useless unless these issues are addressed.  The only thing left would be it's lack of inflation, but then again, the bankers will figure out how to make it fractional reserve again unless people pay attention.

I've been thinking that all this confiscation of cash by police under the guise of "drug money" is really a move to push people into the cashless society.  Even more, bitcoin may be the planned global currency, it's just enticing people in right now because of its incredible potential for profit.  Ever notice how Casascius was taken out of the picture early under the guise of "money transmission", yet bitcoin is a transmission of value by default?

Actually, while the current owners of GHASH and CEX may not be bad actors, it is concevable that they sell their company to a third party that does not act nice.
Also consider how existing market dominance causes problems elsewhere.  For instance, ComCast and Verizon demand extra payments from Netflix.  Amazon is currently using its market dominance to demand cheaper books from some publishers by delaying deliveries.  Walmart uses its market position to make particular demands of is suppliers.  All that GHASH would have to do is to demand BitPay or Coinbase pay them an extra monthly fee to NOT block their merchant transactions.  This would slow purchases, and possibly allow unscrupulous costumers to double spend when BitPay or Coinbase is used (GHASH would not be colluding with double spenders... just asking for extra $$ in return for fast transactions).

FinCEN can try to claim selling bitcoins is a money transmission service, but unless you are acting like a service (both buying and selling and profiting on the difference), the argument holds little water.  Money Transmission Service regulation is meant to regulate businesses.  In order to be considered a business, you have to be working to make a profit.  Simply selling your coins to liquidate your position, or buying coins to invest or spend does not make you a business.

[Fungibility]( - Fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution.
If exchanges are examining the coins and giving people trouble based on a coin's history, then more and more people will start worrying about the source of coins and stop valuing some coins over other coins.  Imagine a vendor selling gold for bitcoin, and all of a sudden the vendor finds he cannot cash out of his bitcoin because the coins he received are tainted.  He'll stop taking bitcoin.  Now extrapolate this problem to every vendor that takes bitcoin...  If it's not easy to exchange to cash, then you are going to have all sorts of problems spending it, because so few businesses are taking it.

If you knowingly mix it for those who are criminals it is, but if you are mixing coins for the purposes of fungibility, protecting your privacy, and without knowingly helping criminals, it is a baseless charge.
We should be concerned with dealing with ethical people and avoiding criminals.  In fact, that is how government gets its power.  People see crime and are to lazy to work against it, so they clamor for a "king"/government to use force to hunt down those who act unethically.  Unfortunately, this "king" usually ends up being corrupt or corrupted and people don't think or read enough to take back the power granted to the "king".
As far as the ethics of drug laws and the bitcoin community is concerned, we should be taking the stance of avoiding transactions that tied to drugs.  From the individual stance, you should advocating the end of drug prohibition.  Connecting the two in people's mind gives the bankers what they need to neuter bitcoin by regulation.
As a side note, people should be very careful about those who mention that they are using money or bitcoins for illegal purposes.  Also ask them if they are doing illegal activities with the coins before initiating a trade with them.  This gives you an extra edge in that you are actively avoiding criminals, and avoids any FBI stings that may be trying to entice you into this "money laundering" trap.

[NSA surveillance: A guide to staying secure](
It's well known that the NSA provided the elliptical curve numbers that then proved to be cooked.  There was no bug, the encryption was weakened and the NSA had the numbers to crack it, because they provided numbers that would give them access.




That's not the point.  You are arguing that its improbable that the closed source has been hacked, backdoored, or simply has a bug.  I bring up these three points to demonstrate that was once though improbable has actually happened.  No-one thought it possible that a USB could be an attack vector... e.g. just plugging it in infects your computer (without an autoexec.bat).  Yet it was demonstrated as a possibility.
I'm not really sure why you find it so important to assure me and everyone that Trezor closed source boot loader is safe, but I find it kinda odd.  Unless you start thinking about how nefarious the U.S. government has become and considering all the security risks it creates, bitcoin will never grow.  Other governments KNOW how nasty the U.S. government is, and this is one of the reason's Russia, China, and other countries are working to block Bitcoin, because they don't trust that the elliptical curve numbers are not cooked by the NSA.  If you don't believe it, then you've not been doing your homework.  If you want a few links and you're willing to do the reading, let me know, then you'll see just how bad it has become.

Unless these exchanges have 100% verification of bitcoin funds, we should not cheer.  What happened prior to 1913 (with the federal reserve act), was that the "banks" used fractional reserves.  This inflated the money supply, and often the banks would fail when there was a run on the banks.  The banking failures were used as an excuse for the Federal Reserve Act which first caused the roaring 20's with fast and easy money followed by the contraction of the money supply that cause the great depression.
If the NY regulators are really interested in helping bitcoin, the will get out of the way and let innovation verify exchange funds.  If not, then history will repeat itself with bitcoin instead of silver "backed" bank notes.
What is needed is more innovation before the banking sector gets the bitcoin market cornered and inflation followed by exchange failures results in people clamoring for more "regulation".  We should continue to buck any permission based exchanges (exchanges that ask for permission to exist).  Asking for permission is a sign that we are not free.

I would like to see them do this as well.  However, if they are holding funds because of coin history, I would have a problem with that.  I'm betting they have a system to check coin taint.
This is one more reason I'm such a supporter of coin mixing.  If coins are mixed by default, issues of fungibility can never be an issue.  Because coins are NOT mixed by default, bitcoin will be facing fungibility issues by the simple fact that regulation will require due diligence to find the source of coins.  Now the value of bitcoin will be under attack because of this "due diligence" will create horror stories of people either having their funds frozen or being visited by authorities because the sold a car or house with tainted coins and tried to cash some or all of them out.

E.G. unsubstantiated chat text, scribd documents that show gox as only having 2k BTC left, insider trading (BTC price drops just before major news stories), continual negative spin in all the posts.  All this is NOT characteristic of what we've seen before on What's really perplexing is that nothing is being said from Mark/MtGox.  If they have a coin address, it should be visible on the block chain.  You'll also note that the Subpoena is from NY, which is where all the talk of regulation is coming from.

Do you believe that those whom you are conversing with in the Senate are actually not corrupt?  Do you believe they are honest about making a better world?
Let them know that there is a vast disconnect between those who use Bitcoin and the government in general.  In the last 5 years, so much corruption has been exposed that the average Bitcoiner does not place any faith in congress or the existing monetary system, and before we can even honestly discuss what rules can help Bitcoin, those creating the rules have to prove that they can make good decisions.  Right now any rules coming from "government" in general are going to be looked at in a jaded light, no matter how well intentioned those creating the rules may be.  
They can start with a few of these:
* Get the courts cleaned up and ruling on the laws the way they were intended to be used.
* Get corporate personhood under control or simply revoke it.  There should never be an investment where the investors don't risk more than the money they put into a venture.  If you invest in something, you are responsible for all the damages that the investment may create.
* Get money out of politics.
* Get the NSA under control.

The more I watch the more I realize that this meeting is more along the lines of trying to deflect and redirect the alternative currency movement.  The discussion does not address the rule of law which is the valid form of government from which the constitution springs forth, and the valid limitations placed therein where congress is granted the power to regulate the "coining" of money and the "value thereof" (meaning the amount of metal which each coin should contain), and not the "printing" of money.
If you understand this history of U.S. money and the limitations placed in the constitution, then you also understand that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 represents a coop against the rule of law called the constitution.  It has since indebted the U.S. (along with many other nations), and has forced wars to defend the value and to defray the inflationary effects of government spending on foreign nations.  We here in the U.S. are living large, not because of hard work (although we are actually prevented through various regulation and compliance rules from working in a lot of industries), but rather through a strong dollar supported by the labor of other nations because those nations need dollars to purchase oil.  This is the ugly monetary policy that this think tank does NOT discuss.

The money is obviously your's.
If you happen to take bitcoin for something like a car or a house and want to cash out, only to get hassled by the exchange, then what's that going to do to the value of bitcoin?

Murder is a violation of natural law.  It's a violation of universally accepted behavior... (or whatever philosophical terms you want to use).  "Regulations" impose punishment for behavior that is normally a "moral right" or "universally accepted behavior" (again, whichever philosophical term you want to use).  Creating a "man made law" that imposes penalties by some sanctioned individuals is not the same as following a "natural law".  Violating a "natural law" is going to get you condemnation and probably the use of physical force by anyone near to you to stop you from doing it.  Violating a "man made law" is not going to get people to gang up on you, it will probably only cause code enforcers (e.g. police) to come and subdue you with force.
NOTE: I make the distinction between "man made laws" and "natural law".  That's not to say that "man made laws" mimic "natural laws", in which case its not really "man made law", it's a "natural law" (universally accepted behavior... or whatever...).
So the comparison of murder as a violation of laws to a violation of regulations is a poor attempt at an example.

That's a false equivalent.  Financial regulation has characteristics of the [communist manifesto]( where "Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State", or Fascism with respect of government takeover by banks and other financial interests.  Bitcoin represents a challenge to this "authority", and this proposed regulation is an attempt at soft selling financial chains so as to thwart this challenge.
To suppose "You can't have it both ways." is baloney.  There's a middle ground.  Government researches, and advises, and consumers either take the advise, or ignore and get burned.  This is how government can protect people without restricting activities, instead of protecting special banking interests.  Further, if government wants to "protect" people, it needs to enforce the existing fraud laws and prosecute the banks that it perpetrated the fraud.
Government exists to protect the rights of people, and restricting the rights of individuals to act via contracts violates those rights.  Further, the government's inability to act to "regulate" the banks, even when being told by existing investigators that banking fraud was going on shows that regulation is basically useless.

Just for reference, you can export the key through the debug window, but not all the wallet programs accept the bitcoin-qt format.  For example, the Armory wallet cannot interpret the wallet private key from bitcoin-qt.  You would basically have to send the coins to the Aromory wallet via the bitcoin network.

No, cleaning money in and of itself is a fictitious crime.  It is my right to hide my money.  It is my right to keep my finances private.
Note, what you say about killing someone is NOT a right, but rather a crime in all sense of the word.  However, there is another associated crime called "aiding and abetting".  If I knowingly help a criminal hide his money, then it's called "aiding and abetting".  "Money laundering" is simply a way for governments to take away our rights and privacy by fooling people into thinking its a "crime" and a "shady" activity.

Yes, but we are talking about a "service".  If my intent is to sell $500 in bitcoins and I sell them to you without a markup, then it is obvious my intent is not to act like a service, but rather to liquidate my $500 position in bitcoins (at the market value).
How could the prosecution convince a jury that my $500 sale is a "service" and not a simple transaction if I'm not trying to profit on the trade via a markup or asking for a fee?  I have something that I want to sell and I sold it as a one time deal, without the intent of repeating the process by re-purchasing at a discount.  I may profit from the sale via capital gains, but there are obviously no gains via a service fee or markup.

It all really depends on who gets to decide what transactions go into the block.  It could be "decentralized", but if GHash gets to decide the transactions, then its not addressing the core issue.

It will succeed by the simple fact that it automates payments of value without being tied to gobs of regulatory personal information.  Value can be attached to the bits and people will pay money or exchange goods for these bits.  This un-attachment to the real world but still having value is what will make bitcoin unique and solve problems that previously could not be easily overcome.  It's digital nature gives value for friction less trade that could not otherwise be solved without some complicated and burdensome revocable payment system such as credit cards.  VPN's, internet tipping, WiFi vending systems, etc. all can now easily take bitcoins without the concern for outside accounts.  The variety of other problems that bitcoin will solve give it staying power as an internet virtual currency.  Only government harassment and threat of force via crony interests will curtail its use in various parts of the entrenched developed nations.  Developing nations containing large numbers of unbanked, or hyper inflated currencies, will find it useful as an alternative.
So, no, bitcoin is not going away, but rather it will fill the cracks where traditional banking has failed, and will force countries and banking institutions to re-assess how much shit they can pile on the average citizen.

If you compute a block (e.g. you are a miner) that has plenty of transactions and the rule I suggest applies, then you should release the block, and all the nodes will help you transmit the block
If, however, you are a miner and you don't include enough transactions, then the nodes will take your block, but they will delay transmission of the block (say for a minute or two).  This will negate the advantage the miners are trying to achieve by not placing transactions in the block.
Currently, miners will try to compute a block without transactions because there's a slight advantage to propagating their solution.  If there is a disincentive to do this, then the miners will stop this practice.

My take is that the encryption is something we need to be aware of, but its still in the CIA's best interest (if the rumors are true) to not take advantage of any back doors quite yet.  In the mean time, take advantage of the drop and ask the developers to add alternative encryption methods.

I'm not an expert.  Take my advise and use your own judgement.
I've heard that some states allow you to record a conversation, so long as you know the conversation is being recorded.  Other states have laws against it unless both parties understand that the conversation is being recorded.  So recording another person without their knowledge could be criminal wiretapping.
My two main points are, turn away anyone who mentions that they engage in criminal activity, and don't sell above or buy below the exchange rate (e.g. at a profit) unless you know it will not push you into the money transmitter category (read your state law).

Upvote your -1... you don't deserve downvotes.
It's possible, but does not seem likely.  Gox is far more valuable as an exchange than the value of its deposits.  If they make 1% on each transactions, all that is needed is 100 x average daily deposited funds in trades to exceed the funds it holds at any given time.  It does not make sense to abscond with depositor's funds, when in a year's time you can make much more than your depositor's funds in fees.
If they wanted to show some good faith, they could start processing BTC requests by hand.  This would ease some of the bad press and outside pressure.  But then again, I suspect that MtGox does not have the business acumen put the proper human controls in place to pull this off.

The way banks use fractional reserve makes it more profitable than obtaining a deflationary currency because they can get profits over time, whereas a one time increase in value is far smaller.  If a bank has a reserve requirement of say 10%, they can loan up to 9x the number of dollars in their vault.

@_date: 2014-06-14 17:50:14
No, I understand how transactions work.  But with such a large portion of the pool, a direct discrimination would be far more profitable than the existing ~3 to 10 cents per transaction.  If BitPay is currently getting 1% profits, then GHash might be able to extract .25% to .5% which is much larger than 3 to 10 cents per transaction.  If BitPay decides to dump more into their transaction fees because of the direct discrimination, then they can still decide to take the transaction fees.
For example, if BitPay is getting 1% and the average transaction is $100, then that's $1 per transaction.  If GHash decides to press BitPay for say 50 cents, that's at least 10x more money than simply collecting the standard transaction fees.  BitPay would either have to wait longer to verify transactions in non-GHash pools.  It's a basic monopoly play.

There are two problems with your assessment:

2. You miss the planned future KYC requirements that will destroy potential advantages that bitcoin has over traditional banking.
To assume that these regulators or proposed regulation (that has not even been released yet) is benign is foolish.  These matters are serious and freedom crushing.
Just think back to Lawsky's first draft.  He totally ignored what the bitcoin community had to say and attempted to just do whatever is banking masters wanted.  You should not believe what he has to say, but rather what he has done so far.

I don't doubt that deep pockets can swing the price of bitcoin.  In fact, the high price of BTC right now could indicate an effort to accumulate coins for just that purpose.  However, there are still a lot of "believers" who would simply buy at $10 and continue to use bitcoin in the manner intended, and would get "rich" doing so.  (rich... not in the ball park of "rich and powerful")  Those "believers" that are not shaken by the price will serve as examples of holding, and the cycle would repeat with increasing adoption after each cycle.
The only thing that can really destroy bitcoin is if the encryption turns out to be back doored.  This is a real possibility, given how NSA/NIST back doored another elliptical encryption method.  This is the biggest threat, and the developers need to examine methods of adding different encryption methods so if one encryption method is found to be flawed, others can take up the slack.

First: Bitcoin is not part of the federal reserve or banking system.  He does not have jurisdiction.
Second: If he did have jurisdiction, there are political costs to enacting regulations, that could give his bosses headaches.  So he would have to make his actions appear justified.

If you sell and buy regularly and do it for profit, you are going to get snared by these immoral laws.  If, however, you are liquidating your position or buying into a bitcoin position, then the activity of buying and selling is not the focus of profit, but rather then increased value of bitcoin.

People value privacy, its just that the cost of privacy is not only about cost.  It's also about the difficulties imposed by other factors.  If two services are identical except one has better privacy, people will opt for the one with better privacy.  You can see this with regards to the IT sector abandoning the U.S. because of NSA spying.  People are opting for services not based in the U.S., and U.S. IT companies are suffering.
Bitcoin removed those barriers to privacy and made it easier to hold and send value.  This is why bitcoin is gaining ground even at a premium of obtaining bitcoin.  What BitLicense is attempting to do is to re-impose those restrictions that the banking industry and government have created to protect their interests.  People on localbitcoin.com are paying a premium over the exchange rates to keep their privacy, and because the difficulty in obtaining the coins via an exchange can be a nuisance.  Bitcoin ATM's that don't require a lot of personal information are charging a premium for the convenience.
While the author may be correct that the exchange rate may not be different, the bitcoin community is very sensitive to anything that will impact fungability which is highly tied to privacy.  There's a good chance that coins coming out of NY will be tagged like pariah coins until they are mixed.

Brock Pierce defiantly looks shady on paper, but it's hard to tell, as money tends to attract bad characters good at manipulating.
All this reminds me of of the Muligan's Mint snafu that the silver community endured.  A guy the the name of Rob Gray supposedly took people's silver to be minted but never gave any rounds in return.  Upon further investigation, it turned out that Rob Gray has a very checkered past.

Define "Money laundering".  If it is hiding the activities of crime, then yes it is also a crime, but more specifically its "aiding and abetting" and does not need a special classification of "money laundering".  If I mix my money or bitcoins for purposes of privacy and not for crime, it is not "money laundering".  However, the ~~loose~~ lose term gives regulatory beasts power to pry into your personal activities, where they should really not be.
I basically object to the term because it is and will be misused... just like the word "terrorism" is being tossed around.  The old definition of "terrorism" is violence with the purpose of inciting fear for political reasons.  Now the term is being used for anything from drug trafficking to filming of slaughterhouses by animal rights activists.
If the term is to knowingly help criminal activity by hiding money, then it's "aiding and abetting" and the extra term is just a scary term used to drum up support.  If the term is to simply mix coins or exchange money with others, then its not a crime in and of itself.  Either way, it's a bad term.

Mixing is used to: 
1. Protect privacy.
2. Protect against rubber hose attacks.
3. Protect bitcoin fungability.
Government agencies have abused the trust we've given them over the years, so now privacy is going to be a big issue.

There are legitimate reasons for wishing to avoid government scrutiny and it has nothing to do with crime in the conventional sense.  If government is misbehaving, there is a great need to support whistle blowers.
Also, there is a serious problem with the bitcoin block chain, in that if you spend coins and someone sees that you have lots of coins, you risk physical violence.
So, hiding what you have is necessary as a non-violent ethical being trying to either avoid bad people or bad government.  It is propaganda to assert that someone who is hiding their money is a criminal or helping criminals.
The real crime is "aiding and abetting".  If I take money from someone who is a criminal for the purposes of hiding their money, the fictitious crime of "money laundering" is actually a real crime called "aiding and abetting".  "Money laundering" is a natural right just as self defense.

[letstalkbitcoin]( sheds light on all of this.  It appears that the the report of only 2k coins left only makes sense if the private keys for those coins were lost.  Theft does not look likely, and other posts have found proven Gox hot wallet addresses with 200K BTC.  That's not to say the keys are available, however.  Losing 700k BTC to theft even from the start of MtGox seems nearly impossible to overlook, when there's a monthly audit.

Fractional reserve banking allows the banks to create money.  Holding $10 in their banks allows them to earn at least $10 per year.  That's year over year, not a one time deal.  Why would they spend $10 billion to buy up say 20% of the bitcoins if it only multiplies their investment by say 100x, but threatens their multi-trillion dollar a year revenue stream that gives them year over year returns. ($10 x 100 = $1 trillion &lt; trillions of dollars per year )

Well, if bitcoin is more anonymous than cash, then why not go directly to bitcoin from a bank account? (Ignoring the fact that the banks tend to get snotty and close your account if they find you are buying coins.)
Bitcoin is much more traceable than cash because the blockchain records time, amount, and address (grouping of coins).  Patterns can be established based on frequencies of these variables to find large sums that may be suspicious.  This allong with your phone location (if you are using a cell phone for trading) and computer ID.  Also, trying to wash a small amount of coins enough to be untraceable get's expensive (at ~ 8 cents per move where hundreds of moves will be required...).
While all these things can be over come by someone with a lot of computer knowledge, the average criminal will get caught, and the average Mexican drug lord will not want to shift a lot of funds around in Bitcoin because the larger the funds, the easier it is to track.  What's more, you currently need to be on the internet to spend the coins, and thus as soon as you spend, **your location is given away**.
Basically, if you are a criminal using bitcoin, you will get caught.  If you are a criminal using cash, you have a day or two before the serial numbers show up and your **general location** can be obtained.

Paul and Charlie Stoss have it out for bitcoin, calling it "inherently damaging to the fabric of civil society", yet they fail to provide a reasonable alternative to the dollar hegemony that keeps us in war with any country that challenges the dollar.  The IMF does it's dirty tricks and overthrows governments, assassinates leaders, or ensnares them in fictitious debt.  They are well known evils, and this is what is pushing people to use Bitcoin.
If Paul and Charlie want to criticize bitcoin, they'd best examine the banking system they defend and work to remove the evils it harbors, instead of making bitcoiners out to be evil monsters.  They would have friends in the bitcoin community cheering them on, and bitcoiner's would be more willing to listen to their reasoning.

You should not be downvoted, but I've posted elsewhere in this thread... The dollar is established, and is not threatened by the problems of fungibility like bitcoin can be.  Bitcoin is much more easily traced, and if people have to start worrying about the sources of their coins then bitcoin will fail and merchants decide bitcoin is not worth the hassle, and people have to worry about getting "tainted" coins.
This is also why I also advocate coin mixing as the norm.  If all coins are mixed, then there are no tracking problems, and questions of fungiblity are not an issue.

The posters of reddit contribute a lot of very important content.  Also, it takes time to build a sub-reddit following to make the top page, and if there is already one there, there is a lot if inertia.  If the sub-reddits can be gamed or taken over by the mods and censored, then the trust factor in reddit.com is at stake.
Take for example.  There is always a lot at stake during an election, and having a position as a moderator on can be a very powerful position to be in.  There are over 3 million subscribers and 1 to 5k readers on at any one time.  So, imagine that a moderator is payed to take down particular posts that don't sit well with a particular candidate, or that a moderator gives up his position for cash.  The old phrase "everyone has a price" comes to mind...
Perhaps reddit needs a modification to disallow deletion of a post by moderators.  Rather, individual users can select which moderators they wish to subscribe to, and the moderators would decide what's junk and what's not.  If the user does not like what the moderator is doing, he can select different moderators to filter the spam.  Also, users would not be banned, but rather the selected moderator could block his "subscribers" from seeing a particular abusive user.  The same could go for websites... a moderator could block his subscribers from seeing content posted to a particular junk website.
In any case, reddit is starting to go the way of digg.com, and people who are posting important links can see the censorship happening.  Something has to happen soon, because important issues are being ignored.

Did you know that the 1930's great depression was due to a tightening of the money supply after the massive expansion of the money supply in the 1920's?  Did you know that the gold confiscation of the 1930's actually killed an alternative currency in a time when more liquidity was needed?  Did you also know that the fraud was well known and the consequences of that fraud was known well before the 2008 crash?  **Its not about "deregulation" or "more regulation", its about mismanagement and the proven incompetence of those running the show.**
While you may have a point that deregulation helped fuel the situation, the root problem is that financial alternatives did not exist to make the overall economy robust to mismanagement by financial regulators.

Just be patient.  Don't hold so much that you lose sleep over it.  If history repeats, it will drop to around 150 to 200 over a 1 to 2 year period.  When the payout goes half again, you'll see the price rise again.
The nice thing about the price is that it is not fluctuating as wildly as it did in its previous peaks.  This means that more people are using it, and the speculators are getting burned.  If you have a job and believe in bitcoin, simply buy small amounts on a regular basis, and spend to reward the merchants that take bitcoin.

Ever think that drug use is a symptom and not the cause?  Studies on rodents in a desirable environment (e.g. when they are not stressed) show that when given a choice between drug laced water and regular water, they will avoid the drug laced water and opt for the normal water.  However, if the rodents are in a stress inducing environment, they will opt for the drug laced water.

The banking system is set up in such a way that the Federal Reserve "lends" money to the banks if their reserve requirements get to low.  The bank's reserves were to low because the loans that they had created were bad and the revenue streams (from these bad loans) was not sufficient to increase their reserves.  This is was the crisis.  The banks were insolvent and could not "borrow" from the federal reserve.
What should have happened was that the Federal Reserve should have stepped in and taken over the bad banks and issued currency to cover the shortfall.  Instead, what happened is that congress and Obama borrowed money (increased our national debt) and gave it to the bad banks to cover their shortfall.  This was called a "bailout", but actually what it did was just take money from the unborn generations and give it to the bad banks so they could continue to operate.
The banks needed to fail and be taken over by the lender of last resort... (the Federal Reserve).  This would have resulted in inflation, but at least it would not obligate "tax payers" to the "lenders" (other banks that shuffled off their bad debt as "AAA" to the failing banks).
In essence, the smart banks got rid of their bad debt (by labeling it "AAA") to the not so bright banks, and then lent money to the Federal government (with the taxpayers on the hook) to pay for the failures of the not so smart banks.  **Basically we got fucked by the fraudulent banking system, and Obama and congress helped in the process.**

That is why it's important to nail it down now before it's cast in stone.  If the mixing is not built into the protocol, then it stay's "Surveillance Coin".  We have to demand it, and if the developers don't take notice, we should start telling people to avoid Bitcoin and becoming detractors.  Bitcoin as it stands will be WORSE than the existing money system because the state will be able to watch every single money transaction.

This all has to do with the nature of the fractional reserve banking system.

Sorry.  I'm not in favor of strong centralization, but reddit is the best platform for exchanging good information at the moment, and it is a strongly centralized system.  The general reason people dislike "statism" is because those in charge CAN be corrupt, or eventually replaced by corrupt people.  That is not to say a well run "statist" system can operate, its just that eventually the system will become corrupt.  Therefore, if those running the system are not corrupt, there's no need to hasten the corruption of the system by rolling the dice.

Granted.  That would kinda make "Ripple" the company and "Ripple" the foundation a scam.  Ripple the system is still open source software.  If the people who own XRP see this happening, there should be lawsuits to address the issue.  On the other hand, if you don't own much XRP and simply use it for its intended purpose (a system of social loaning and trust), where you pay a very small amount of XRP to record transactions, then it's not really a scam in that sense.
I think the problem is that everyone owning Bitcoin perceived Ripple as the same as XRP, and as "competition", and missed the core value it brought to the table.

So, basically, these cronies are working to issue and sell more stocks that actually exist and using media shills to starve the companies out of business.  This would only work if the companies were in vulnerable position where they would need future revenue based on their stock price (e.g. issue more stock to get more funding).
This sounds like a crazy opportunity for someone wit some balls and money.  Basically, you would determine which of these companies are under attack, look for a low point to buy a majority of the company.  Once purchased, insist that the shares be issued to you in your name and mailed to you.  This forces the brokerage firm to get real shares and none of  fake shares.  (Sorta like demanding to hold physical gold or silver.)  Once the shares are in your name, demand that the company go private.  Those who've sold these "naked shorts" (e.g. fake shares) are going to get their asses handed to them.  Once you have the company private, give it all the funding required to make it invulnerable to this attack, wait a few years, and put it back on the market.  Profit and laugh your ass off.

Being an early adopter, my average cost is super low (and my record keeping is shit).

If the IRS wants to dispute my cost basis, I'll simply let them claim my cost basis is $.01 per bitcoin which will only garner them $50 or less in extra taxes.
Presto... privacy preserved, and accounting simplified.

It sets the president of having to ask for permission.  We should never have to ask for permission for something that does not harm another.
Further.  If NY sets the standards, bitcoin price could be manipulated just like gold and silver was (and is).  By not publishing the amount held in reserves, the "exchanges" could start operating like banks.  What is needed is more competition without regulation so that people and techies can find exchanges that do not cheat or find ways of verifying an exchange's reserves.
At this point, I suspect the banking establishment's strategy is to create a trading platform that everyone looks to for setting the price of bitcoin, and "selling" bitcoins that it does not have, to scare and manipulate people into not investing or buying bitcoin.  This has been done before, and we should be savvy of this trick.
 "If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs." -- Thomas Jefferson.
Inflate by selling more bitcoins that exist, then collapsing exchanges causing unexpected deflation.  The only way this will be good news is if the NY regulators also make a rule that all reserves will be held at 100% and verified by publicly posting all balances along with a proven signature of their reserve addresses.  In other words, we've been down this path before, and unless people wise up, it will be played again.

Perhaps, the CIA is trying to create an alternative currency to the U.S. dollar to challenge the banking system, and possibly a way to fund their activities without taxes.  (In the 80's the CIA used drug running to fund covert activities.  With pot legalization, and other countries seeking to decriminalize drugs this activity will not due.)

The problem is that the current "dictator" shows no signs of being corrupt, and may be "benevolent", in which case, let's not roll the dice.  Instead we should start building the infrastructure to decentralize the web and make reddit like systems that are not dependent on one person or group of persons, and then start migrating to that system.


This is a valid point.  Once a system is "entrenched" its difficult to change.  Only pain from the existing system will encourage people to look for alternatives.  However, if you anticipate that pain and create a system that is better, whereby you can profit, all you have to do is sit and wait for the current system to become corrupted and then offer your alternative.

Mark Karpeles taking the coins is a safe bet.
1.) He has not reported these coins in his bankruptcy protection.
2.) The bit coin addresses associated with MtGox are way to large and far to old to be explained away by MT.  If it were an MT issue over the last few years, then the blocks would have been much smaller.  Also his KYC implementations would prevent large sums of BTC from being withdrawn with out tracing the source of the users who caused these fake transactions.
3.) Mark is lying when he blames the exchanges failure on the MT issue.  And this is in legal documents, so if the Japanese courts do their jobs, they will catch him.  But with so much Bitcoin at stake, bribery may be an issue.
My take is that all of this is that Mark created all this spin and chaos to cover his tracks.  
1.) Leaked the crisis document to twobitidiot.
2.) Hinted that the U.S. government has a gag order on him in chat.
3.) Left his servers open to hacking after the initial bankruptcy protection hearing.  The post Gox closure hack will help Mark cover his tracks if prosecutors start asking about the coins seen on the block chain.  He can claim that hackers took the private keys of those large blocks of coins and start shuffling them away to cover his tracks.
4.) Suggested that the coins were "temporarily unavailable".  This gives lots of options, because if he's backed into a corner, he can provide the keys and simply explain away the rest.

You sound like a government plant trying to egg everyone on so that the "state" has an excuse to pull out the regulatory hooks.  Who we encourage to use bitcoin matters because it associates bitcoin with bad elements.  If the regulators get their way, they would be able to put all sorts of rules together making it impossible or undesirable to hold or buy bitcoins.
But the regulators are limited by public opinion.  If they try to regulate for something were no perceived problem exists against the desires of the public, they will face lots of heat (resistance and bad press... politicians HATE bad press).  By touting bitcoin as a tool to support corruption (of which it is NOT) by appealing to people's greed, you give the rest of society the impression that bitcoin is a good tool for crime and corruption.  This perception is exactly what is needed to counter any resistance regulators may face when attempting to regulate bitcoin to death.

What you are asking for is moderation and to tone down the "rhetoric".  The core issue with bitcoin it that it challenges the status quo.  That's its purpose.  All you have to do is to look at the initial block created by Satoshi to see that the intent of bitcoin is to challenge that status quo.  There is NO reason for the core believers to back down and aqueous to those who simply want to make a buck, because to do so will relegate bitcoin to more and more regulation and to turn it into a "PayPal" where everything is so restrictive that it has no real value.
Government has proven over and over that it is corrupt, and we should not be quiet nor give in just to get along and see a price increase.  Companies that operate in the US may want "regulation" so they can be "secure" in their operations, but we are not interested in those companies.  What's needed are government reforms, not government regulations, and bitcoin is simply our way of stepping off and going a different direction in hopes of peacefully forcing reform.  What you advocate is being quiet and behaving so that bitcoin can be co-opted and relegated, while the existing system places more roadblocks in the way of bitcoin's growth and adoption.  We should not be quiet just because a few of you want your short term bitcoin growth.

How can Gox addresses still contain 100's of K of BTC, if they were all stone by MT?  If they were taken slowly over the years, then the monthly audits would have caught the problem.  If it were a recent phenomena, then the only customers that could have pulled this off were ones that were registered by KYC so the could withdrawal large sums at a time to drain the funds quickly.  The obvious danger to the criminals is they would be registered with the exchange, and even then, Gox would have to pull from cold storage and someone would be alerted.

So, heads up.  If you use SSD's, you will not be able to pull that off again.  SSD's will reset the blocks in preparation for a re-write, and thus zero them as soon as they are un-allocated.  Thus, the longer you have an SSD, the more unallocated blocks it zero's out.

The government wants to avoid the issue of how they obtained the data by saying that the server was located external to the U.S. so warrants are not needed.  But....
They lied to the judge about how they obtained the data.  This brings into question all their testimony.  Once you lie in court, your credibility as a witness is shot, and all evidence is tainted.  If they stated that they hacked a foreign server from the start to expose an illegal web site, then they might be able to claim that no warrant was needed (its  still debatable.).

I'm still trying to figure out all the angles.  The scribd document was "leaked" by [Ryan Selks]( (with heavy ties to the financial sector).  The chat that supposedly supported the theory that Gox is insolvent was posted by "Jon Fisher" according to [coindesk.com](  I cannot seem to find much on this Jon Fisher... only that he's ["an industry consultant based in New York"](  The NY part is interesting because...
1. Talk of financial reguation is happening in New York.
2. SecondMarket is preparng to launch a Bitcoin exchange in New York.
3. CEO of Mt.Gox is being summoned to New York.
Theory:  Mark was made an offer for Mt.Gox and that offer is on the table.  Gox cannot talk about the offer or his solvency or insolvency.  The shit storm that is going on is being created to force a lower buyout price, and those "leaks" are part of a strong arm tactic.  The insolvency, if real, is not as bad as the scribd document describes.

Reports are floating around that because secp256k1 was used instead of secp256r1, that Satoshi was a government actor.  secp256r1 was discovered to be back doored by NIST/NSA and only a handful of people would have known this.  It also throws into question the secp256k1 encryption.  The site that hosts the secp256k1 is down (  I can't find the source, but there was a report some time ago where China was warning that the Bitcoin encryption was backdoored by the U.S. government.  Basically there's fear that the long term potential of bitcoin is limited.
We're going to have to provide different encryption options in bitcoin so that if one is broken or back doored, the coin loss is limited.  Using a pre-computed ECDSA numbers provided by a 3rd party is going to be questionable, as the NSA has proven this is a way to break or weaken the encryption.

What all this doom and gloom spin is doing is trying to pain the 700k BTC as lost and not part of the $64 million, but it would be silly to try to ask the creditors for permission if those 700k BTC are lost.

Not quite.  The point about oil is that other countries hold dollars because they need oil.  This has allowed the Fed to print dollars without massive inflation.  Basically other countries have been absorbing the influx of dollars.  When those oil producing countries decide (or can get away with) selling their oil for other currencies, those stored up dollars held by other countries for the purposes of buying oil will be dumped and the value of the dollar will plummet.  Look at it like this... What would happen is Satoshi decided to start cashing out his bitcoins?  The circulation of bitcoins would increase, and the value would plummet.  The same holds true for dollars and countries holding dollars for oil.
Further, because oil producing nations will no longer take up the slack of extra dollars put into the system, the Fed cannot print dollars without causing inflation, and as the U.S. government continues to "borrow" from the Fed, the result will be a double digit inflation scenario.

The Federal Reserve is the lender of last resort.  The government "borrows" by issuing bonds, and the Federal Reserve buys these bonds by issuing new dollars (usually electronically).  (Actually it's a bit more convoluted than that, but it's basically what happens.)  If other countries need dollars, they will offer goods and services for these dollars (or the bonds that will pay in dollars over time), and thus the inflation is dispersed to other countries.
If the power to print money without the effects of inflation is removed, then the government has less power to "borrow", and the expenditures must be decreased.

The fallacy that you can have people in positions of power that are not corruptible is what makes people believe regulation can work.  It can only work so long as everyone is doing their best to make sure those positions of power are good people, but it never happens because everyone has lives to live and cannot spend a lot of energy and time finding out who's good and who's bad.  People have to suffer the consequences and learn to take care of themselves.  If you deny them this suffering and learning, they'll only suffer worse when the servants become their masters.
Benjamin Franklin said it best:  "People willing to trade their freedom for temporary security deserve neither and will lose both."
So if you used to think regulations are good, stop it now, because you are very mistaken.

Nope, like direct payments.  "Pay us x per month or we will exclude your transactions from the blocks we create."  BitPay and CoinBase would have to depend on the other 49% of the miners and hope their merchant's customers don't send another transactions and double spend.  Right now BitPay and CoinBase depend on nodes to make sure there is not a double spend in the pipe before authorizing a payment.  If GHash ignores the transactions because they have not been paid, then there's a greater chance that someone could double spend transactions sent to BitPay and CoinBase even though the network saw and propagated the valid transaction.  GHash could even play one off the other... "BitPay is now fast tracked, but you CoinBase will not get fast tracked unless you also pay... and you will suffer a loss of customers to BitPay."

This is correct... right now.  Any regulation written at the moment is basically useless to control the flow of coins.  It's sorta like Napster vs. BitTorrent.  They can't control BitTorrent.  It's just to pervasive.  However, create a central company like Napster, or KimDotCom, and you've got a target.  Big targets are easy to control.  Lots of little ones are impossible to manage.  Increasing the block size makes companies who serve blockchain data targets, and deny's the average user the ability to traverse the whole thing.  Imagine what happens when a company gets charged with "money laundering" or perhaps "running a money transmission business without a license"... all because they're a company that get's paid to serve up the blockchain.
If altcoin's can figure out how to divide the block chain, they'll be the BitTorrent to Napster, and bitcoin will either fade away or will become co-opted into a new gov-coin.

The sending IP, the date of the transaction, the amount, other known metadata about the coins sent.  Hell, bitcoin is a window right now for any agency that wants to see your activities.  Even if the coins are mixed, there's going to be enough to analyse the probably sources and destinations of illicit funds.
It's amazing how the money laundering angle is being used to try to dislodge bitcoin from its growing potential.  Either its not private enough, or it's a tool for criminals.  Its never about how the government has created the drug cartels via prohibition, or how government agencies like the NSA hack into every known source to collect every piece of data, or how the government has failed to prosecute banks for mortagage fraud and then doubled our national debt by unnecessarily "bailing out" the banks.

Keep in mind that prior to threats from the U.S. government, Casascius was doing a brisk business.


The EMP/internet disaster problem posed is a point I bring forward to make people aware that bitcoin is currently highly dependent on internet connections at the moment.  Also, white listing would be ineffective if physical BTC were somewhat useful.  The point is to head of a potential regulator trap before it can take place.  If physical bitcoins are in circulation, trying to create legislation enforcing white listing becomes moot and the legislators laughed at.
Scaling problem:
People will find a way.  The're are always things like giving fiat back as change.  Just as people said bitcoin would fail because of it's volatility, you can claim that physicals will fail because of added complexity of calculations.


Good point.






Your point depends on the impossibility of someone inventing or creating a good counterfeiting countermeasures.  My argument hinges on gathering support so that government stops using force to prevent the creation of physical coins so inventors can work on the problem with some hope of profiting and avoiding jail.


lol.  Your ego is so butt hurt.
1. I totally understand your arguments, and to claim otherwise to support your claim that I'm "uneducated" is a stretch.
2. Saying "we need this" is not a demand.
3. Saying we should advocate or caution against widespread use outside the internet is NOT a threat.  You may take it as such (probably because you want to profit or avoid loss of lots of funds), but my argument is geared toward the bigger picture where people could starve, commit suicide (because of economic turmoil), or be subject to further dictatorships (because of bitcoin's tractability).  My statement regarding limiting Bitcoin is a theoretical course of action, that would need to be taken by a large number of people to be effective.
I'll also remind you that you own your actions, and I own my actions.  If I see that bitcoin's use can be dangerous, then I'm free to discuss such dangers, just as you're free to discount such dangers and advocate for bitcoin.  Neither actions constitute a threat.

XRP was supposed to be a method where you can "pay" for your transaction to be recorded.  The intention was that XRP was supposed to be a stamp system where you put a stamp on a letter, but it was traded more like a currency with the expectation it would increase in value.
The ripple system itself could be very useful if you can remove the controlled/manipulated value of XRP.  I've suggested in other posts that ripple simply dump the XRP scheme (which looks to be very contentions in the pdf provided) in favor of an inflationary system where anyone can do some computation to make "money"/"stamps" to record transactions.
Unfortunately, greed and the desire to control instead of trust and willingness to be open has destroyed ripple.  Systems of money tend to attract psychopathic characters who are outwardly nice and amiable on the surface, but are vicious and backstabbing if they can make a buck or get in their way.

Been trying to point this out to people.  If you are exchanging bitcoins (buying below the exchange rate, and selling above the exchange rate) you are providing a service and if you do it often enough, you are going to run afoul of the transmission laws.
If, however, you are an individual who is either liquidating your position or buying a new position and you are working at the exchange rate and not playing both the bid and asked rate, then you are not making a profit on the difference.
Basically, you are not a service if you are not profiting by playing both sides of an exchange, you are simply an individual looking to buy bitcoins for your own use or for long term capital gains, or you are liquidating your position to reap long term gains.

Poor comparison.
1. The regulators and government failed to prosecute or even file charges against those who perpetrated the fraud.  Regulation is supposed to make fighting crime easier, yet they fail to even prosecute when the regulations are in place.
2. Just because there is NOT regulation does not make fraud a crime.  Burdening EVERYONE with regulations because they MIGHT scam or defraud someone is a violation of rights.  Regulations change something that everyone has a "right" to do into a "privilege", where you have to ask for "permission" to do something.  It turns responsible adults and business people into children begging for permission.
3. There are already laws on the books that say fraud is a crime.  The regulations supposedly impose rules on everyone and make law enforcement's job easier... at the expense of everyone's freedom.  So, if the regulations and those in "authority" fail to "protect" us against the very thing that happened, then what's the point of giving up our freedom?

In the coming days, expect a lot of talk of regulation as the solution to these problems, but remember how the banks screwed us in 2008 and in the 1980's.  Also remember how PayPal has been co-opted into the system and how it is now nothing more than a fancy credit card system.  Don't fall for this trick.

Putting the power to legislate what you can and cannot do and not prosecuting your cronies in the banking (or whatever industry being regulated) is going to be worse than letting people decide who to trust and relying on proven reputations.  Good regulators will only make people lazy to rely on said system until it is corrupted.  (Just look to Gox and how the community is now very wise to leaving any funds with an exchange.)

No, but it's backers want centralization/control.  Coinbase (like Cricle) is becoming a puppet of the banks.
If the average user cannot traverse the block chain to verify transaction, then only those central points can verify every thing.  This allows for manipulation of the actual number of coins via inflation.  People will have to depend on 3rd parties to verify that they actually control coins.  All the clients will become thin.
If bitcoin is to succeed in reigning in the banks and stopping theft through inflation and thus powering wars, the verification of the limited money supply is a must.  Everyone has to be able to verify the limited amount, or we just get another arbitrary fiat system... only, this one is "cashless" which is what governments have been pushing for for some time.

[Robert Newman's History of Oil](
The U.S. dollar is currently the reserve currency, and it is also what oil is priced, and purchased in.  Other nations hold dollars so they can purchase oil.  This has allowed the Fed to print dollars (and the government to "borrow" from the fed) without causing lots of inflation.  Basically, when (not if) the oil producing nations start to price their oil in other currencies, those stored up dollars will return to the U.S. and cause lots of inflation.  Also, after the initial wave of inflation, the power of the Fed to issue more dollars without causing massive inflation (increase in the price of goods), will be diminished or basically destroyed.  Thus as the government "borrows" from the Fed, the Fed will have no other choice but to cause double digit inflation by issuing more currency to cover what the government "borrows".
Basically, oil has everything to do with it.  When the world demand for oil diminishes the U.S. will suffer withdrawal.

Bitcoin has its place to solve quite a few payment and money transmission problems.  However, you are correct to be worried about using it as the "world's currency".

Its the reporting requirements that will be a problem for bitcoin.  Bitcoin is  promoted as semi private.  Now you are required to declare them, and its not to far fetched that they will require the addresses the coins are stored at. This has major problems:
1. Now the IRS will be in your face and in your purchases.
2. The reporting of ownership can be dangerous to those who hold coins. (NOTE: Some tax companies share your personal information, and putting this information in government hands is not always safe.)
3. If the government knows how many coins you have they can take your coins (by force) like they did for gold back in 1933.  Its just like the 2nd amendment defenders with regards to gun registration.  They know from history that the first step in disarming people is to know who has the guns.

A collapse will happen in one of two ways... extreme inflation or extreme deflation.  Both will get people to start accepting alternatives.  But this has a shaky side effect that if the internet goes down, bitcoin is useless.  If we want bitcoin to be resistant to this, we need to start figuring out how to make physical bitcoins and avoid the nasty "money transmitter" laws that Casascius got caught up in.  Perhaps the "coins" could be "minted" in California (where alternative currencies are legal) and sold there.
NOTE: Deflation IS possible but not as likely as inflation.  It happened in the 1930's when the banks tightened the money supply after a period of liberal money printing.

Interesting.  The cash side of the equation can easily be solved by a lump sum payment to an organization that can distribute the funds.  The problem with dollar withdrawal has to do with the banking bottlenecks, and thus not a question of amounts but rather with the number of withdrawals.
1. Sign paperwork to agree to take a lump sum withdrawal to a 3rd party entity. (Thousands of people can sign up.)
2. Gox pays one lump sum quickly.
3. The 3rd party entity pays out funds to the thousands of people who signed up for this payment method.

Cash is king.  I don't like the deposit trick and I agree that it's kinda sketchy.  If you are using banks, there are special reporting requirements when dealing with $10k, and if you try to bypass those reporting requirements, its another snare and possible trip to the slammer.


Never felt that way in a bank.  My mood is more along the lines of mild contempt and annoyance.  "You force me to deal with you via your trumped up laws, and cheat our economic system... I'm not going to violate your precious laws, but I'm certainly not going to fear or have a high opinion of your profession." (Not stated verbally, but that's the internal dialog I have.)

Instead, the banks in collusion with congress and Obama "borrowed" money to prop up these institutions, and now the citizens of the U.S. are saddled with paying interest on loans made by shaky banks.

It's a double edged sword.  The larger the block size, the more centralization there is.  Either way, banks and authoritarian are going to angle for control.  Its just the nature of these beasts.  Increasing block size is like decreasing the number of ISP's.  There's going to be fewer points to control if the block size continues to grow.
However, saying that keeping the 1MB restriction is what banks favor is false.  The author asserts that "it will push all individual users off the blockchain to rely on trusted third parties.".  This is TRUE (unless we find a way of safely creating un-trusted side chains), but his starting conclusion is FALSE, as banks are not necessarily trusted, and inviting competing trusted parties is much better than making more centralized points of control.  It's a twisted argument that you've got to think through.
We basically need side chains.  It's already been demonstrated that side chains CAN work, if the maliability problem is fixed.  Increasing the block chain size is a TEMPORARY fix.

Licensing is fine as long as it is NOT mandatory (e.g. at the point of a gun).  That's why you have "licensed" building contractors vs. unlicensed.  The market can determine if they want the licensed and more expensive services, or the unlicensed cheaper services (with more risk).

A solution does exist already, but because it uses what considers a competing currency, it is shunned.  That would be ripple.  
Suggestion:  If people don't like the idea of ripple as a currency instead of an exchange system, perhaps the system could be re-configured to use a inflationary "currency" (stamp system) based on computing power to send validated transactions.  That way, it does not competition with bitcoin that is more or less deflationary.

If a hard fork is tricky to do, implement it in the next emergency hard fork.  If there are problems, a soft fork roll back is not difficult.  Further, when SegWIT and LN are ready and fees need to be pushed up, do a soft fork and slowly move back to 1mb blocks to force fees back up and move people to the LN.
Everyone understands that a 2MB increase is a TEMPORARY measure to buy bitcoin time.  No one wants to continually increase the block size to create centralization.  Centralization is the last thing anyone wants.  But we do need growth.  If we don't demonstrate that bitcoin can grow, all the VC will pick up and abandon bitcoin.  Bitcoin will be left without the infrastructure to get into the main stream.  It will become the plaything of the internet without value or real purpose.

Patience.  The prior bubble produced prices 10 times larger than the following lows, and took about a year and a half to start recovering.  For example, after the last $30 bubble, the price settled to around $3 or so.  That's 1/10 the price from the high.  This bubble peaked at around $1200, but there's a lot more attention.  I would say wait 6 months and look for prices at or below $200, or start buying now to average down over the next year, with the expectation of another bubble over $10k or so in the next 2 years.  It's going to take well over 10 or so years to get bitcoin stabilized.

There's still a person or person's in control who can decide what is said, what get's deleted and who can join the management team, even when the community of users does most of the work by contributing content.  Each time, the community of users has to wait and see if the "management" is corrupt.  In short the design of the system IS centralized.

It will not happen that fast.

I would point out the damage by all this infighting is far greater than the risk of just implementing the 2MB increase and doing a soft fork rollback if its to unstable.  It would put an end to the bickering.  Core could continue to develop the LN and SegWit code and then slowly soft fork the size back to 1MB to encourage users to migrate to the LN.

Usenet is a pre-WWW protocol for exchanging messages.  It's sort of like a distributed forum.  Back before torrent, people would encode images and binaries into text and post them on Usenet.  The activity still goes on today (or at least I belive it does), its just not that well known.

The trick is to make people think its legal.  Go do research on the tax system and you'll find there's no law requiring you to file taxes.  If enough people understood this, then the current tax system would fail or there would be so much political pressure that the system would lose legitimacy. (As a side note, it's nearly impossible to challenge the tax system because so many people are on government 'handouts' or dependent in some way on the system that those challenging the system are treated as pariahs.  There's not much hope of challenging the legality of income tax because so many people don't want it to be true.)
My objective is always to expose so as to either make systems lose legitimacy in everyone's eyes, or to get these systems to reform to their proper limited roll.  Basically, if your "enemy" wants to do something that you don't like, but you can't stop him, you make it as expensive as possible.

Wow. Lots to take in.
Some repercussions and insight the Bitcoin community should consider.
* Government agents are incompetent and/or corrupt and will take any fall guy possible.  This, along with the banking failure to prosecute should be used as ammo against the effectiveness of "regulation".
* As I've stated before, the Bitcoin community should distance themselves from criminal activity if bitcoin is to become main stream.  Finding that bitcoin is tied to drugs at the Mt.Gox exchange level is not going to help.  Everyone should tell people that if they buy drugs with bitcoin, they will be caught because it is much easier to trace.
* NY regulators WILL attempt to use this as a reason to saddle bitcoin with choking regulation.
* Charlie Sherm might also be a MK victim.  DHS gets MK to ask Charlie questions about money laundering to feed prosecutors another victim.  (Just a hunch...)

I would agree that coinbase was probably sold to investors as a growth sector, and coinbase has developed a lot of infrastructure to support bitcoin.  Why would the bitcoin community want to bash coinbase?  Coinbase is one of the few companies that has gone through the process of registering with a whole slew of states so they could set up an exchange.  Bashing them is like shooting yourself in the foot.  If coinbase goes away, bitcoin will suffer the loss of one of the few US exchanges. 
Hell, the current (dropping) price is based on the expectation that bitcoin will grow in usage.  If the objective is to spread bitcoin's use, then coinbase is one of the companies you WANT around to help facilitate its growth.  Core should be considering Coinbase a partner and at least address their concerns in a respectful manner.

Price volatility exists because the laws prevent people from issuing money backed by real things.  If it were issued with someone buying the "money" back in exchange for something like gold or other goods (e.g. "defending" the currency), then there would be no or very little volatility.  Hence, it is issued with no backing except "faith", and governments that use "force of law" can shake that "faith".

The point is, to the average user, the post is anonymous.  I'm not talking about reddit or my ISP.  People reading what is posted on reddit should not be taking it seriously unless there's a real name associated with it.  There are plenty of trolls, and other miscreants that roam reddit, and to say that posts are credible to the average reader is reaching.  Anonymous posts are not credible, except as reference for further investigation.  That's the whole point, I can be sitting in a coffee sipping coffee while posting crazy shit on the internet.  The only real legal consideration would be if the post is an attack on some private person, not on a company that is working with the public.  
If I post: "Donald Trump has sex with donkeys." via reddit, people are not going to take me seriously.  But if I write an article claiming "Donald Trump has sex with donkeys." in the Huffington Post and put my real name down, I'm going to get a call from his lawyers.
However, if I post "Jane Doe has herpes and sells her services at night." on reddit (besides being against the rules of reddit), where "Jane Doe" is a real person but not a public figure, then that's bullying and is cause for action against the poster, via court orders to reddit and my ISP.

The problem with pegging a new crypto currency to an existing government currency is that you simply replicate the existing problems with government currencies by supporting the value of a government currency.  This does not challenge the banking system.
However, if you create a currency that is "backed" by an algorithm that increases or decreases the supply of the currency based on a basket of goods, then you could theoretically bypass government tampering.  It may require a central backer or a group of backers.

It detracts from the usefulness of Bitcoin.  Even if you want to use BTC in everyday transactions, you risk the store or some stranger seeing the transaction and then deciding that you have a lot of coins.  Can you imagine an old lady buying stuff with her bitcoins, and then some hacker thug decides she's a perfect target, given that he just analysed the coins?
Or how about just watching the large BTC transactions going buy and tieing them to an IP.  Once you have an IP, you can then find the location from where they were sent.
Coin mixing is going to be paramount for security.

If you are not making a profit, how can you be considered a money transmission service?  That's one of the points.  If I have something to sell, I have every right to sell it and not be considered a "service".  If I sell for a profit and buy at a discount continually, then I fall much easier into the category of a service.
Also, we have valid reason's for not using a bank.  1. They have changed the rules where the banks can confiscate your money if they fail, and 2. The banks have been known to close accounts for any bitcoin association, 3. Banks have been known to freeze funds from or to exchanges that they think are "suspicious" when they are totally valid.  There is nothing suspicious about using localbitcoins.com, and everything we do can easily be explained to a jury.

[San Francisco Bitcoin]( meetups account for around 1-2k active members.

That's around $210k to get elected or around $210 per active bitcoiner in CA.  Note that not everyone would have to chip in $210, but labor could be contributed to such a cause instead.

If its cash, you really need to work in person.  Mycelium (the android bitcoin wallet) has an ad-hoc selling option, and LocalBitcoins.com are pretty good places to sell bitcoin.


If they send MO's to you, they have to have your name and address and mail fraud is a serious crime.  Also, you will have to deposit large MO's into your bank account.  Finally, there's an escrow service on LBTC if you still need people to trust you.
Just be aware that if you're buying AND selling (large amounts) that government agencies will stick their nose in and want to put you in jail for not following some rule, even if your actions are moral.  I've had a few people ask to buy over $10k or more in BTC in a months time.  I turned them down, because they were probably some law enforcement looking to snare me because of reporting requirements.  $10k per person per 30 days requires some sort of filing requirement.  Just avoid people asking to buy more than $5k, and keep your activities to the "hobby" levels that net you under $600 or so per month.

Part of the rational is that it allows users to "unstick" transactions.  However, I posed a "compromise" where RBF cannot be used unless a transaction has been stuck for an hour or more, but it was shot down and I got lots of hate for the "compromise".  My conspiratorial alter ego thinks that core has been overrun/infected by Masons or some group bent on destroying bitcoin... but I have no real proof other than the actual results of their actions (e.g. the price drop, the incivility, and division) and how they refuse to have a rational discussion.
It appears that the only solution is to abandon core and start working with XT, classic, or some other more trustworthy group.

As I've stated before, Bitcoin will drive security.  Exchanges only have maybe upward of $500 million each and bitcoin's market cap is ~$3 Billion with only maybe 1/2 that active.  But most major banks have much more on deposit.  The advantage of the big banks is that they have fraud departments running all the time, can reverse transactions, and have actual government support to help go after major hacks.   Bitcoin exchanges don't have that luxury of money, reversible transactions, and support.  Further, they operate on the internet where hacks can be virtually anonymous.  Considering all this, it is quite amazing that there are not more major hacks, and exchanges like BitStamp operate so well.

Please note the definition you cited uses "fraudulent".
[Fraud]( - Fraud is a **deception deliberately practiced** in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain.
Therefore, bitcoin cannot be a Ponzi scheme.  However, people can misrepresent bitcoin in order to profit, that would make their actions fraudulent, but it still does not make bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme.
What Satoshi described is a problem all currencies have because speculators will buy or sell based on sketchy information.  Because they don't have **conviction** about the value of an item, they are easily swayed to buy or sell.  Often, these speculators will end up losing money because their emotion gets the best of them, and others will push the price up or down just a little and wait for a bigger move (either up or down) as the speculators become greedy or scared.

Consider Ukraine and Libya.  In both countries social media was used to stir up dissent.  Countries like Cuba block Twitter specifically because of this tactic.  Now Russia and China are looking for ways to keep western governments from causing problems.

As long as there's a bit of profit, there will be miners.  It's just a question of how secure the network will be.

The reason this issue is being muddled is because bitcoin makes difficult economic warfare.  Randolph Silliman Bourne stated that "War is the health of the state".

In order to change this, the miners would have to vote on it.  How do we get around this issue of self interest voting by the miners?  If that could be done, then we can start talking about different algorithms.
EDIT: Here's a thought.  Already 3/4 of the bitcoins have been created.  Let the miners continue to mine the remaining 1/4 of the coins on the main block chain.  However, since the block chain cap is at 1MB (and core refuses to allow an increase), permanent side chains will be needed to process transactions outside of the main chain.  This is where we can do the experimentation on different "mining" methods.

The NY cannot yet regulate Bitcoin directly, as it has not been granted the authority.  It is faking that it has the authority.  Right now it can only regulate around the edges where companies hold dollars or other government fiat FOR clients to turn into bitcoin, or turn bitcoin into government fiat.  Basically, exchanges are the only thing it can regulate unless the NY legislature modifies its authority.  
It cannot regulate wallet developers.  It cannot regulate people selling bitcoins or buying bitcoins as individuals.  It cannot regulate bitcoin "ATM's".
The only way they can "regulate" these activities is if they can trick people into thinking they have these powers.  Ask "Where's the law?", and these other powers melt away.

I would ask you and others who oppose the 2mb increase to also weigh the damage being done to bitcoin's reputation by the current bickering.  If you remember back to the last emergency patch and consider the damage done to bitcoin's reputation, how does it compare to this drawn out crazy battle over the block size?

The value of a companies stock is roughly based on its ten year expected revenues discounted to the present day.  Anything beyond 10 years when discounted to present value is relatively small unless the expected growth is huge.  
In order to make the expected growth look larger than it really is, you don't want to air the industries dirty laundry.  Doing this only makes it look like growth is farther away, and thus makes the calculated stock value lower and harder to sell on the open market.
Trying to change the block size by blaming core as a systemic problem does nothing to bolster a claim that bitcoin is going to grow rapidly.  If the strategy is to ask VC to pay for new developers to replace core, you still don't announce this to the public.  Instead, you'd do it privately.
Also, anyone paying attention in the bitcoin market will know that the 2mb increase is only a 1 to 2 year solution, and that the bitcoin community is staunchly against promoting block size increases that would to grossly centralize bitcoin.  So any market valuations of Coinbase stock is going to have this in the calculation.

The smart move is to realize where these interest intersect and to treat with respect, while at the same time showing other VC that exchanges can be profitable.  The more exchanges, the less dependence you have on one particular exchange.  But to trash Coinbase only sets the example to other potential VC that bitcoin is a fickle and hostile group.


Not really.  However, I cannot see how the current circulation of bitcoin could justify its current price assuming no growth.  Therefore, I belive its reasonable to assume the current exchange rate is based on the expectation that bitcoin is going to grow.
Another indication is the high volatility of the bitcoin exchange rate.  This only happens to stocks who's price is based on super high expectation of growth.  A slight change in the expected growth makes the price shoot up or drop like a rock.

Nope.  This is an issue of strategy, not ideals.  Ideally, there should not be laws against drugs, but rather some sort of health policy instead.  Strategically, if you are trying to avoid the regulatory capture that the banks are planning, you will need to figure out a way to make it politically expensive to justify bitcoin regulation.  One of these strategies will revolve around money laundering, so you've got to figure out how to sell the public against it, so that politicians will look at it and say "it's not in my best interest to vote for these regulations".  
I'm proposing that we attack the concept of money laundering in terms of its root crime which is "aiding and abetting".  If it is ok to mix your coins so that you keep some measure of privacy, then bitcoin can survive the fungibility problem and the regulator capture planned by the banking establishment.
Trying avoid the bank's planned bitcoin net by arguing that using or possessing drugs is not immoral is a harder way to avoid the net (regulatory capture).  Right now there's an association of violence and theft when their's a drug issue.  This knot is not worth untangling at the moment.  By the time you can untangle it, the planned regulatory attack will have finished, and bitcoin will be neutered by regulation.

They'll have to become a bit more paranoid because the stakes are so much higher.  Things that used to be taken for granted are now going to become real issues.
For example, who'd have thought that USB drives could infect a computer by just plugging them into your computer (e.g. not an auto run, but at the driver level...), or how one researcher found that stock hardware transmitted a virus via ultra sound (one computer sitting next to another without even an Ethernet cable).  Snowden exposed the NSA hacks where they intercepted hardware and replaced the Ethernet ports with ones that intercepted and transmitted data via RF to receiving devices.  Before the advent of LCD, CRT's were vulnerable to people watching in another room with a specialized device that picked up the radiation the CRT was emitting.  Imagine if modern video cards were equipped with a backdoor to transmit a low power TV like signal that could pick up what is being displayed.  
All this will have to be addressed for Bitcoin to be accepted on a large scale.  What I've mentioned here may sound crazy, but I have a hunch that these things already exist because those in 3 letter agencies think this way, and have lots of funding and guns to make it happen. Before email became super popular, there was a myth that email could infect your computer, now its very common.  What seems uncommon is going to be exposed as Bitcoin hacks happen.

The only way VC's make money is if they create a company or companies that show the potential for long term growth (5 to 10 years), or con others into believing that they companies they create have long term high growth potential.  Short term high growth is never a good indicator of the real value of a company created by VC and will usually be outed by the savvy investor looking to buy what VC has created.  Therefore to say that VC's are a systemic risk to bitcoin is simply false.  VC by its nature looks for reports of consistent long term growth.  VC looks to build something new in the hopes that it can demonstrate high growth potential.  Any VC that invests in the bitcoin space has no interest of subverting bitcoin for short term profits, because doing so decreases the value of what they create.
What may be more accurate is crony interests seeking to disrupt bitcoin to protect their established banks or companies.  Such interests may proclaim to be VC, developers, social media contributors, etc., but their real intent is to preserve the status quo.

The US constitution is the strictest document for limiting government powers.  If the US government is held account to this law, then we would have a lot fewer problems.  This is why so many Americans point to the constitution and it shows how clearly the government has grown outside of what it was intended to be.
Other counties have constitutions, but because of the way they were written, it allows a lot of interpretation and government growth within the  bounds of those constitutions.  Ours is clear, and to further support how it is being twisted, the federalist papers show what the writers of the law were thinking.  Basically, we're getting pissed off because we are know we are sovereign individuals with liberties, and the law was written to protect those liberties, yet every day, the courts twist the original intent to fit every new growth in government powers.
There's also a basic philosophical difference between our constitution and other constitutions.  Our framers believed that the rights of men are unalienable, and that men agree to grant government limited power so as to protect those rights. (sovereign men)  Other countries view this in a different light.  They believe that the rights of men are granted by government, and can be taken away at any moment by new laws. (sovereign government) In this sense, the US constitution is a contract between those who possess unalienable rights and the new entity (government) created to protect those rights.  **Thus, every time the enumerated rights listed in the constitution are violated, it is a violation of this contract.  Whereas, in other countries, it is not a contract, it is a master telling the slaves that it will grant them liberty, but can take away that liberty at any time, because that's the right of a sovereign government.**

Yes, they do, but they are also rational and realize that they cannot have everything.


Requesting 2MB is not requesting building a new bridge, nor is it requesting the design of a better bridge to stop.  Its a request to patch the existing bridge to extend its life for a year or two.


This is not about "free".  Its about facilitating real transactions.  Keeping the blocksize artificially small forces the fees up, which is fine, so long as the existing blockchain can handle all the real transactions.  However, if the fees get to high, then it is going to turn away real transactions and stunt the growth of bitcoin.

It all boils down to how they think they can prevent it.  People want privacy, and there are real legitimate reasons for keeping your coins private:
1. Free speech.
2. Supporting person's or organizations that while legal are unpopular with the government. (e.g. Snowden defense fund, groups seeking to legalize drugs, etc.)
3. Being able to hold a lot of coins without bad people knowing you have a lot of coins.
Thus, coin mixing is a legitimate activity.  The trick is that "Money Laundering" is actually just a subset of aiding and abetting (e.g. knowingly helping someone hide the source of their illegal coins), but the name makes people think that mixing is also illegal and illegitimate.

Bitcoin is a piss poor method of moving large criminal funds around.  
1. Terrorists cannot move large sums of funds through bitcoin.
2. Bitcoin is much to traceable.
The only real illegal use for bitcoin is probably to purchase drugs, prostitution. e.g. Victimless crimes not worth pursuing by large organizations like the NSA, or FBI.  Its only when the crimes get large enough that bitcoin becomes useless to large drug organizations or terrorists.  In those cases, its probably much easier to deal in gold, diamonds, silver, platinum, or cash.  [Even these guys]( now know that coins are easily traced.  In other words, if you're doing something seriously large, bitcoin's not the way to go.
If anything, the one real crime that bitcoin facilitates well is the crypto-locker ransomware and similar scams.  These however, are under $1k and not worth the attention of police, let alone the NSA or FBI.

Like it or not, if bitcoin is going to grow, we need companies like this to help find the price and to help propagate bitcoin into the business world.  With one less exchange, bitcoin to dollars becomes more and more centralized.  It is correct to say that depending on one US exchange is risky, but you don't bash them because they are a systemic risk.  Rather you treat them nice and try to find competition so you have more options.  If the community spits on them, other potential exchanges will turn around and run.

The issue is zero conf.  The core developers are destroying what has been a common practice of checking various nodes to make sure that enough nodes have received the transaction that they can depend on it reaching the block chain before some competing double spend attack.  Basically, zero-conf is NOT perfect, but it allows a good estimate so that the chance of double spend is near zero and worth accepting before it reaches the blockchain.  (E.G., it makes using bitcoin in person reasonable).
The change the core developers have put into .12 destroy's this ability to estimate transaction double spends by allowing the sender to replace the transaction in nodes running core by adding a larger fee.  So now a fraudulent customer can send bitcoins to all the nodes and walk out of a store, wait a few minutes and double spend without any risk, whereas before, it was a race to double spend to enough nodes without detection while in the store.

Yes it does, and you know it.
After .12 comes out, run a test with RBF and without RBF:
1. Send a transaction.
2. Wait 2 minutes.
3. Try to reverse the transaction.
Record the results of 10 of each type of transaction and see what percentage of the transactions can be reversed.  This will demonstrate the risk of zero-conf, with and without RBF.  It will also serve as prof that zero-conf without RBF IS reliable enough for most transactions.
For those who are miners, I would propose that you modify your versions of core so that you take a quick consensus of a transaction that has multiple spends, both with RBF and without RBF and reject transactions that have been replaced after a consensus of nodes have been reached.  This will help protect the novice users from scams using RBF.

It almost sounds like what we really need are a  bunch permanent side chains where miners can "mine" for fees but not for coins.  The main chain would be used to record the starting point for the side chains and allow the coins to move down into the side chains.  Coins would still be mined and moved around on the main block chain, but as fees go up, people will opt to go for the side chains.  The side chains would be vulnerable to 51% attacks, and so 3rd party trust would be needed to single sign transactions to thwart double spend via a 51% attack.  There would also be more dependence on thin clients.  Not the ideal solution, but its still better than a huge centralized chain.

What would happen if there were memory pool "pools" where the "pools" get a fee for serving up transactions to the miners.  The miners would request the top paying transactions first.

Core should relent on the 2mb issue, but only long enough to test and get segwit/LN ready.  Then retract the block size as needed to support segwit/LN.  At the worse, if core is correct, and there are issues, then core wins the debate and the classic folk look like fools, the code is soft forked back to 1MB and the civil war ends.  A temporary soft  fork rollback from 2mb to 1mb is by far less damaging to bitcoin's reputation than all the infighting.

Do you actually know why bitcoin is rising at the moment?  It is because the Chinese government is enacting various laws to restrict the flow of money.  And yet you think more laws will give it legitimacy?  Get real.  Bitcoin is succeeding because people want economic freedom.


By supporting bitcoin, we ARE seeking to overthrow the existing laws... by making them irrelevant... by inventing around them.  Inviting me to change the existing laws is like trying to direct my energies to play in a fixed game.  The legal system is rigged.

Yes it will.  Localbitcoin.com would have to leave the state.  It would make it harder for people to trade bitcoin, and the private liquidity would be blocked in favor of KYC businesses.  This is a bad law, and if we don't stay on top of these things, other states will try the same damn things until bitcoin has no more advantage than the average bank account... and probably less.
@_date: 2016-06-24 05:23:52


Yes.  Existing money transmission laws are tyrannical/corrupt and it is exactly why bitcoin has been able to sidestep the existing laws... because it is not legal money and it is not backed by anything.  Expanding existing laws to encompass bitcoin IS anti-bitcoin.  The bitcoin community should be fighting this in every aspect... however, the divide between big/small block/ethereum is allowing these fuckers to try to capture bitcoin in a way that escaped existing laws.  
Changing the existing laws would make localbitcoin.com subject to all sorts of nasty regulations and it would have to block the state, just as it did in NY.

Go put a few bitcoin in localbitcoin.com and tell me if you can see the private key of the coins.  If you don't have the private keys, you don't control those coins, and that business would be subject to the change in the laws.

Localbitcoin.com is not currently a money transmitter.  Bitcoin is NOT a legal currency nor backed electronic exchange at the moment.  This is what this law attempts to "rectify".


Tax is a separate issue.  The issue is that if you deposit coins into his game that he's promised to pay you back (minus the coins you spend in the game), now he's subject to onerous regulation because the virtual currency would be legally recognized under this legal change.  It makes bitcoin less valuable because it cannot be used in this way.

Really?  What's your definition of an exchange?  You don't seem to understand that in order to be an "exchange" you have to hold the private keys.  While this is being sold as a way to "protect" people from exchanges by making them comply to the same rules as fiat.  This will crush innovation like Bitsquare, CounterParty, and Ethereum.  Smart contracts will not be able to run in NC.  It is an innovation killing piece of legislation.

Freedom deserves to survive.  Let something better arise and remove the fucking laws.  If bitcoin were able to be backed by gold then it would be superior, but the existing laws make this prohibitive, and existing "regulators" went after LibertyReserve under the guise that they were providing a "money laundering" service... even though they were located outside the US.
**To twist bitcoin's advantage and imply that it does not deserve to survive ignores the fact that bitcoin attempts to solve the problem created by existing prohibitive regulatory frameworks.**  If these laws did not exist, then someone would have created something far superior to bitcoin.

The last halving decreased the daily output of bitcoins by 3600 when the inflation rate was like 20%.  Now the inflation rate is at 8% and the decrease will only be 1800.  1800 BTC is only around $1m in BTC.  The daily trading volume of BTC is around $120m per day.  In other words, the decrease of $1m in BTC per day is dwarfed by the daily transaction volume.
My prediction? I think we will see a slow increase in value over 6 to 12 months to something like $1k per coin.  Nothing like the last halving shock that pushed BTC over $1200 in like 3 months.

Existing money transmission laws ARE anti-freedom.  If you really think that making existing money transmission laws encompass bitcoin, then you're not employing your brain.

Show me how.  If I'm localbitcoin.com's owner, how is this law applicable?
§ 53-208.3.  License required.
(a)        On or after October 1, 2001, no person except those exempt pursuant to G.S. 53-208.4 shall engage in the business of money transmission in this State without a license as provided in this Article.
(b)        A licensee may conduct its business in this State at one or more locations, directly or indirectly owned, or through one or more authorized delegates, or both, pursuant to the single license granted to the licensee.
(c)        For the purposes of this Article, a person is considered to be engaged in the business of money transmission in this State if that person makes available, from a location inside or outside of this State, an Internet website North Carolina citizens may access in order to enter into those transactions by electronic means. (2001-443, s. 2.)
However, money transmission is not defined in this section.  Further bitcoin is NOT legal money.  The law is not precise with regards to virtual currency and can only be vaguely applied.  And since only a vague interpretation could expand its power, the Vagueness doctrine applies.
This is why the changes are being asked for so as to institute regulatory capture of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-24 07:27:30


The law attempts to expand existing money transmission laws to encompass bitcoin.


localbitcoin.com  or how about some game maker that want to use bitcoin as the game currency.  Or how about some other as yet unknown service that would be uber cool, but would be prohibative because it would require holding of bitcoin.


Corrupt or inept.


Prove it.  The existing system has become stagnate because of existing laws.  If the existing laws were not so restrictive, then companies like LibertyReserve would be common place in the U.S. providing far better store of value (backed by GOLD!) and methods of exchange than bitcoin currently does.  Yet the existing U.S. laws prohibited that type of business because they were simply to restrictive.  Yet, here we are with you arguing that we need regulation.

There were regulators and regulation in place.  It was known ahead of time that the banks were not operating safely.  What's more, is because of the previous bailouts of Savings &amp; Loan, these banks probably felt safe in their activities.  To say the banks had no regulation is bunkum.  The government "regulation" of insuring the banks and their prior bailouts, (along with people feeling that they can trust the banks with their money) caused the problem.
Bitcoin currently has no such safety of "regulation" or "bailout".  People using or operating with bitcoin have to be careful.  Saying that bitcoin needs regulation because it it not a safe environment is saying that bitcoin needs a social safety net to coddle people.
Bitcoin is the wild west, and it needs to stay that way so that innovation can continue.  Where safety is desired, the market will provide it.

No.  It makes it harder to get bitcoins.  By enacting and supporting this law, you effectively block localbitcoin.com (localbitcoin.com holds btc so users can quickly convert cash and btc).  It basically makes it impossible to advertise and sell bitcoin safely and privately.  There are probably new inventive methods of employing crypto currency that will now be banned in NC like they are and will be in NY.
What gives bitcoin the advantage is that it currently does not fall under any existing state or federal laws (even though NY pretends it has legal authority).  This law puts restrictions how how bitcoin can be used and traded just like money can be used and traded.  It takes away its advantage and gives the upper hand back to the damn banks and Western Union. 
This law is trash.  Even its intro says "AN ACT TO ENACT THE NORTH CAROLINA MONEY TRANSMITTERS ACT AS REQUESTED BY THE OFFICE OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COMMISSIONER OF **BANKS**".   Regulators don't deserve the power as they've proven themselves corrupt.  People are better off protecting their own money rather than letting government regulate under the guise of "protection".

THIS is the way that we should think about bock creation and consensus.  The protocol says nothing about dealayed blocks, and the miners are actually servants being payed money to produce blocks.
Ideally, I would like to see a removal of the limit and an addition of a communication protocol that can show a nodes policy that is in essence a "vote" for the type of blocks that a node wants to see.  The policy can state things like "I discourage blocks larger than x MB and add a 30 second delay to propagating them.", or "Blocks that conflict with double spends may be delayed by 1 minute.", etc.  Miners would be incentivized to pay attention to these polices and formulate blocks that get the quickest propagation and are least likely to be rejected.
It would also end this infighting.  "You want to see a smaller block size? Set up your own node and vote with your bandwidth."

There's a certain expectation of allowing customers to use your services and then also trade outside of bandwidth once they have connected.  It's kind of expected that you pay for the first interaction and its also to your advantage to pay for extra interactions to build your reputation or use escrow. 
Think of it like this.  Craig's list offers almost all ads free, except a few key ones that nets them bucks for other things.  Or say Google offering free search, with the idea that they can gear their adverts properly to make money.  You accept that not all customers are going to pay all the time, and customers come to expect that they're going to pay for some interactions, but once the connection is made, its fair game.
Start acting like PayPal and doing stuff that cancels trades or boots people off your service and people are going to be upset, because they've invested time in building their reputations, and the expectations are rudely shattered.

Keeping the block size to 1MB can spur the development of side chains because of increasing fees.  Using side chains keeps bitcoin small enough to be checked and monitored by everyone with a computer and reasonable bandwidth.  
Increasing size threatens to make bitcoin more centralized because only specialized nodes can handle the traffic and requests.  Centralization is a problem because bad actors can come in and censor blocks or transactions (ironic... right?).
That's not to say I oppose an increase in the block size to 8MB, rather these are valid issues.

This is no true.  XT is configured to activate large blocs ONLY when enough nodes are running the XT client.  Therefore, there will not be a doubling of bitcoin.  If the XT client did not do this piece of logic, everyone would reject it based on your exact fear... creating two block chains.

I would submit that there are alternator motives afoot attempting to blow this technical issue out of proportion to thwart mass adoption, drive the price down and dissuade people from contributing.  We have people posting unsigned message by "Satoshi" in favor of keeping the block size small (when clearly his prior statements indicated otherwise).  We have censorship on and bitcoin.org.  Finally we have calls for removal of Gavin from the Bitcoin Foundation.  The result is serious damage to Bitcoin's reputation.
It's simple, the technical issue is not set in stone, and the block chain size increase will not happen without a large consensus from the bitcoin miners and nodes.  Large blocks will not activate unless there is a clear majority of nodes and miners willing to work on the new client.  Further, there are fallback options to move to smaller blocks by creating clients that take large blocks but delay or fail to propagate them, thus encouraging miners to make smaller blocks.
If you want to vote one way or the other, set up a node with the existing client, or the XT client, and relax.  Nothing is set in stone.  There will not be a splitting of funds.  It is not the end of bitcoin.  Its simply an illusion to divide the bitcoin community that can be thwarted by simply not making a big deal out of it.

I'm not offended, just frustrated that so many people assert stuff using twisted and faulty logic.  Sometimes its intentional.  


Fair enough.
The obvious reason for not increasing the block size is to put pressure on development of side chains.  Side chains would be a good alternative to a super large block chain that would eventually require centralization.  Solving for side chains now will cause less growing pains in the future, as opposed to doing it later when Bitcoin is 10 times larger.

Yes, and no.  Unfortunately, Satoshi did not foresee the development of centralized mining pools.  The power to change the block-chain size rests partly with the miners, and partly with the nodes.  The miners can come to a consensus to create bigger blocks, but they risk loss of blocks if most of the nodes reject their blocks and only take blocks that the dissenting miners make.  In essence, the miners have to not only come to a consensus they have to have unanimity if they want to overcome the threat of block rejection and loss of profits.
I would argue that the nodes actually have all the power to decide what happens to the block chain because the threat of block rejection is an economic threat.  Further, it just takes a small handful of nodes threatening to reject or delay blocks to keep miners from creating blocks larger than 1MB.  Thus this issue is actually a "rule by minority", rather than a "rule by majority".

Yet the regulation that has grown up around PayPal is onerous and makes PayPal less than desirable.  The rules exist as a road block to keep such systems from growing to large and posing a serious challenge to the established players.
Bitcoin sidesteps all this regulation by creating a system that is not redeemable in anything, other than the trust people give it.  Thus all existing laws are not configured to deal with this new move (except perhaps what CA is trying to do by re-writing it's laws to include crypto currencies).

Its in the code.  Large blocks will only happen if enough people use the new node code.  (75%?)  At that point, those miners rejecting the large blocks will find themselves in danger of lost revenue because their new blocks not built on the new large blocks.  They'll logically switch to building on the large blocks out of self interest.
There will be no split.  This is all a big drama being stirred up over nothing.

OK.  I'll play along.  Let's say there's 100k blocks, and you're a developer.  You archive 90k blocks and put them up on Tor as proof of the next step.  Then you run an procedure to accumulate all the balances for the first 90k blocks and write that out as a file and add the check sum to the code to ensure that there's no funny business going on.  From there, you compile the code and put it up for distribution.
When someone runs this code, it will only start downloading blocks 90,001 on.  Further, it will not download blocks 0-90,000, nor will it respond to requests for blocks 0-90,000.
Give all this, how can the developer cheat?
@_date: 2015-08-19 06:50:29
I think the block chain size needs to be removed, but at the same time, the clients need to discourage larger block sizes by slowing the relay of them.  For example, if a client gets a large block it would delay relaying the large block for a number of seconds.  This would discourage large blocks, but at the same time allow them in the protocol.

Only if you admit that you're wrong about the approach you're taking and apologize.  An honest discussion only works if people are willing to admit they are wrong when superior logic or perspectives are presented.  When egos are at stake via attacking the other party, then there's no point.  Arguing with someone who's ego is attacked to a particular viewpoint is pointless.
(NOTE: I'm willing to admit that the arguments for keeping a smaller block size may be weak.  Also note that I'm in favor of the 8MB block size as a temporary fix for the scalability issue.)

For all those who point to CoinCenter's argument that not passing this law is paramount to killing innovation, I ask you what existing laws have regulatory power over bitcoin?  Bitcoin has NO backing and it's value floats.  Existing state laws are written for instruments that have backing, but Bitcoin has none.  This is why bitcoin IS NOT a money transmission service in the legal sense.  
Unless someone can point at the exact laws that are going to stifle bitcoin innovation, don't believe a word they say.  The Bitcoin Foundation rebuffed CA's attempt to regulate them as a money transmission service and failed.  The CA financial "authority" has referred this to the CA legislature, because they know they have no power to regulate bitcoin.  EFF is absolutely correct.  This proposed law is going to harm bitcoin.  The current lack of regulation is NOT broken and does NOT harm bitcoin because there is NO regulation in CA over bitcoin.  If you think there is... then show us the law.  Prove that the existing laws are going to harm bitcoin.

No it is not.  The problem is that people are being air heads and not examining the issues.  The XT block chain will NOT split bitcoin.  Either enough people will start running with the new client to accept larger blocks, or most people will stay with the existing client and nothing will happen.  **There is no danger, it's simply a political fight between the devs.**


The wild west was one of the liberated places and times to live in.


BULLSHIT.  The author has no concept of how XT works.  If there are not enough users of XT, large blocks will continue to be rejected and blocks will stay small.
CONCLUSION: The author suggests the exact thing that would make bitcoin really vulnerable to attack, that is a central "authority".  Don't be bamboozled, there is no need for "governance", because the code and self interest are going to drive a logical solution.
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:48:54
Who cares!  The devs don't control bitcoin, we do.  We vote with our actions and the code and self interest respond.  That's the brilliance of the system.  It's rule by code, and it works because enough people decide to be ruled by one code or the other.  Code that is unpopular will not get to rule, and the devs can only "suggest" (e.g. write the code).  We get to accept or reject their work.

Nope.  The current fork is a band aid.
My current take on all the drama is that it is created by sock puppets and a poor response by theymos in censoring the move to increase the block size.  People need to step back, take a deep breath, and look at the big picture.  Bitcoin is not the only crypto currency, and Bitcoin is just a big experiment.
People are so vested in one side or another because they have to much value stored in Bitcoin.  Its like any centralized issue or system, people fight to defend it instead of flowing like water to different superior systems.

If we can force people to download the existing blockchian by torrent and disallow requests for old blocks, a lot of bandwidth can be saved.  This would force people to get the old blocks via torrent.  Another idea is to modify the clients to have built in balances for address of old blocks.  This would save space AND bandwidth.

The chain exists in both forms when there is a transition.  There are going to be nodes with the full 100k, and nodes with 10k of that 100k.  Trying to fake 10k is going to be hard to near impossible because other nodes are going to reject nodes not responding with the proper checksums.  Ignoring the first 90k, is not that big of a deal so long as a good 90% (probably more like 99.9%) of the nodes still have a valid 10k along with the balances summed in the first 90k.

Does not matter.

When that happens people cannot be ruled by reason any longer, because there is none.  It's only brute force.  That's why CA is trying to pass new laws so as to continue to appear legitimate.

If your statements were intentional, you're not being succinct, you're being rude and combative, or possibly deceptive.


There are plenty of arguments and points to keeping the block size small, but given your underhanded use of logic, its clear that "discussing" or "arguing" them with you would be pointless and a waste of time.  There's already plenty of text explaining the advantages and disadvantages of both.


Silence is damning in this instance.

I am not aware that existing money transmission laws in CA applied to bitcoin.  Was there a recent change in the law to include bitcoin?  Can you cite the CA law that supposedly gives DBO authority over bitcoin?
Note that Bitcoin is NOT a store of value, nor is it a promise to pay, and its value floats, so all of the state laws I've seen are not applicable.  This is also why bitcoin has been so successful in accomplishing what only banks and Western Union have been able to do.  So, I doubt that CA has money transmission laws that give DBO authority over bitcoin (unless something has changed), and I challenge your assertion that the DBO has authority.

XT only activates when the number of nodes reaches a particular consensus point.  Either the fork happens or it does not.  There is no danger of double coins.  If you think this is why the price is so low, best buy our coins now, because its FUD.  There is no way this will happen without a clear majority of the miners and nodes agreeing.  The only thing currently happening is a propaganda war to either divide the community, drive the price down, and retard mass adoption.

I've seen the argument that this law improves on existing law to make it easier on bitcoin, but the argument holds no water when you understand that the existing financial laws have no way to regulate bitcoin.  Those that say CA's money transmission laws encompass bitcoin, have to understand that bitcoin is NOT backed by anything, and thus existing state laws have yet to enact laws regulating bitcoin.  This includes NY.  I argue that the NY "BitLicense" has no teeth except by the idea that it does.  BitLicense is a paper tiger waiting for someone brave enough to go to court and expose it as a sham.  The financial authority in NY has no jurisdiction over bitcoin because the NY law has NOT been changed.  
CA, on the other hand, is actually trying to create a real tiger, and CoinCenter is running a con job trying to convince people that the bill will not hurt bitcoin, but actually help it.  This is BUNK.  I challenge people to show the law giving financial authorities regulatory powers over bitcoin as a money transmission service.  The proposed bill is a Trojan horse.

Regulatory agencies often stretch the words of the law to make it appear that they really do have the power.  If you take a closer look at the NY laws, you'll find that the NY financial authority does not have any legal way to regulate bitcoin.  That's not to say that they won't get away with the power grab.  Its expensive to challenge a combative regulatory agency on the letter of the law, and often the courts will also contort or stretch the law, just as the regulatory agencies do.

THIS is the real danger with the surveillance society and bitcoin.  Inadvertent association with coins that you bought from a third party.

We already see posts here where people are being kicked out off the exchanges when they sell coins purchased on the exchanges and then sell them to individuals.  We've also seen where exchanges refuse to deal with coins or give people the third degree as to where they got the coins.

I don't think it really matters, and here why:
Miners are very sensitive to block chain propagation.  We can see this due to several miners creating zero transaction blocks.  Miners want to solve and propagate their solution as quick as possible.
So, now imagine if the nodes decided to delay blocks that did not meet specific requirements.  If a block sent to a node did not contain the proper transactions or was blocking transactions, the node could decide (by a policy) that the node would delay propagating that node for 30 seconds.  If enough nodes had similar policies and there were at least 3 or 4 different mining pools, the nodes could effectively make it unprofitable to mine in a particular pool.
I would propose changes to the node software to make them more powerful in deciding what blocks get propagated quickly.

The default client connects to 8 nodes by default.  In addition to fabricating a block chain of 90k (where you change the last end node, which is going to cost you quite a bit of computing power), you're going to have to make sure the client only connects to specific nodes, otherwise it's going to see and alert to a problem.
As I pointed out, if your intent is to fake a transaction and convince one person using one client, the attack you describe is no easier or harder that what currently exists.  People using thin clients connecting to the internet under a controlled wifi situation can be manipulated into believing that they are getting coins under both situations.

If 75% of the users like what 10% of the devs are creating, but that 10% is blocked by 90% of the devs, then there's a problem.  On the other hand if 10% of the devs can block what 90% of the devs want, and 75% of the users side with the 90% of the devs, then that's also a problem.
This is why there the users should decide which code to run and what defines the bitcoin protocol.  We need more experiments, not an authority.  Getting stuck on one version and authority is like making bitcoin rigid and inflexible.

People keep saying that mining centralization is a dangerous thing.  It's not if you start making node policies that screw with block propagation.  The logical thing to do to keep bitcoin decentralized is to start changing the nodes and communicating the node policies.  That way, a mining pool can survey what the nodes want and make the blocks according to what will get their blocks propagated the quickest.
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:40:32
Yes, but nodes control part of the network.  If they decide to delay blocks that are to small or to large, they could do it.  The very fact that some miners make zero transaction blocks is an indicator of this power.  For a miner, its a race to get the next block and propagate it as fast as possible.  Nodes who don't like how a block is created could delay or reject a block.

But then, the thin clients will not know what fees to put on their transactions.  I still think that there's got to be a way for a client to see what current fees are required to get their transactions on the network.
It would also be a cool way for nodes to make a little money.  A node could advertise to hold a transaction in its queue if it contains a small payment to the node (or a payment to a "node pool").

You don't deserve down"voats" (hint hint).  You are correct.  Bitcoin is a very poor store of value at the moment.  The slightest whiff of bad news and its value drops 5 to 10%.  For those who bought in at 1000+, they feel the sting.
Bitcoin's basic function right now is as an online transaction/payment system with some storage of value along with some very good risk to reward ratios (IF you can stomach the risk.)  It serves as a simple transfer of value AROUND the existing banking system that fails to serve the unbanked and things that society shuns. As time progresses, however, and the transactions per second are increased through the lightening network and as people start using it more and more, it's usefulness as a store of value will improve.

If CA passes the existing law, then any business that holds bitcoin for other parties has to ask for permission.

You should not be downvoted.  You are correct to be skeptical.  Obviously changing the law to encompass bitcoin is going to create burdensome regulation.

Printing numbers (inflating a currency) only works so far as there is value in the dollar, or if other countries will buy dollars (sell stuff for dollars) to prop of the value of the dollar.  As soon as other countries and investors stop accepting dollars or if financing the debt becomes becomes to large a problem, then the number of dollars you have to print becomes enormous.  When this happens, inflation will spiral out of control.  When a country defaults, a country can recover easily within a year or so IF its government does not control a major portion of the economic structure AND IF lots of people are not dependent on government handouts.  If people are dependent on government and it defaults, then 1. People on government payroll cannot get paid, and 2. the private sector cannot absorb those who are not getting government subsidies.
This is why its so important to 1. Balance the damn budget and 2. pay off as much debt as possible.  3. Trim government control of the economy and limit "free stuff".  If these things are done, a currency collapse can be recovered from in about a year or so.  If not, then people languish with nothing to do, and no way to be productive.

Socialism works, so long as the state can find a stable stream of revenue.  As soon as it cannot find that revenue, it turns to selling the unborn, or inflating the currency (a "hidden" tax).  In this case, Venezuela, was doing fine because it had a good stream of revenue from oil sales.  However, since the oil market has crashed (from $150 to &lt; $30) and because the production costs are probably higher than $30, the Venezuelan government cannot afford to pay for the social services with oil revenue.  Thus, they are messing with their currency.
Make note, this is socialism's Achilles heal.  If America goes with Bernie and he gets his way in installing socialism, it may be good... up to that point when the USG has no revenue streams.  In a free society, people will adjust and compensate by changing their habits and not depending on government handouts.

Incorrect.  The current laws are geared for instruments that are backed by something and someone.  Bitcoin is not backed  by nothing and no one.  The regulation coming out of NewYork is based on the flimsy notion that the existing laws give it the authority, but the purpose of the NY laws (of what I've read) is again, for instruments that are backed.  The worst current regulations can do is regulate exchanges that hold cash (which is backed), but not bitcoin.

Needs to be codified in the protocol definition that a 75% miner vote determines the next protocol definition, and software that cannot support new protocol definitions need to stop operation.  This would put a check on all this flareup.  No more FUD.  If your code does not follow this logic, then it's not bitcoin.
As far as miner control of the network, the miners are still at the mercy of the nodes.  Nodes should publish their policy on block propagation and delay blocks or blocks from miners they don't like.  Miners would have to be careful not to make to many drastic changes, as nodes would still have the power to cause them problems.

We can debate what "consensus" is, but the protocol has 75% set as the voting threshold to determine the valid block chain protocol.  If this is reached, then the protocol has changed.  If there are some people holding out and not following the protocol change, then they are not even following the original protocol.
What needs to happen is that wallet, node and other software needs to warn and disable themselves if they don't recognize the vote for the new protocol.  That would be the valid thing to do.  However, politics, and hurt feelings seem to rule the day and destructive behavior will happen.
If you think about it, those holdouts would actually be the alt coin if a valid blockchain vote determines that a hard fork should happen.
Also, if the concern is that the miners have to much power, there are ways for nodes to encourage votes in a particular way.  For example, nodes could openly say they will delay 2mb blocks by say 10 seconds, or other nodes could vote the other way and delay 1mb blocks by 10 seconds before sending them down the line.  In this way, nodes do have ways to encourage or discourage particular types of blocks, without resorting to dirty tricks like DDOS and "transaction stress tests".  Miners are sensitive to anything that impacts their bottom line, so they are sorta at the mercy of the network, and working to far out of the "consensus" will result in problems.

Blocks are created by computing puzzles.  The first to solve the puzzle and transmit the resulting block to the network wins.  If there are "race" conditions where two miners create blocks at the same time, then there are "orphan" blocks... e.g. one block becomes part of the main block chain and "wins" and the other block is "orphaned".  Normally, because the difficultly is such that blocks are created every 10 minutes (on average), there are very few orphan blocks... e.g. everyone accepts the latest solution and start building on that block.
From what I understand, if there is a network problem, some miners will not get the latest solution and will continue to solve the puzzle based on old blocks, and then submit solutions that are late.  Thus, these late solutions become "orphaned" because everyone is working on the earlier block.

Although the attended general tries to hype it as domestic terrorism ("Attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism."), the case in question was prosecuted because the von NotHaus currency looked to much like real dollars, and people were confused into thinking they were real dollars.

The value of "bitcoins" on side chains is glossed over.  Unless there is a mechanism to move coins back to the main chain, side tokens will always be worth equal to or (more likely) LESS than the coins on the main chain.  For example.  Someone creates a side chain to "pay for coffee", but its implementation is faulty.  Those "bitcoins" stuck on the side chain are worth LESS than the bitcoins on the main chain.  The result would be end users having to know what side chain their coins are on.
Also, how are coins accounted for on the LN to take into account these coins stuck on a failed side chain?
I would hope I'm wrong.  Can someone correct me?  Are there trustless ways to move coins from a side chain to the main chain, or are they basically stuck in a side chain once they are moved?

Anything not mentioned as a power of the federal government and NOT prohibited by the constitution is relegated to the states.  Also, one of the things relegated to the federal government is interstate commerce (commerce between the states), yet almost all the states have "money transmission laws" that regulate transmission of funds.  These regulations have been written at the state level.
Your statement is sort of a misdirect.  Was this intentional?  If you know that the states regulate various things, you probably also know that I'm not talking about laws at the federal level.

Don't give away all the secrets.  Leave people some room to be creative or the thugs will always assume you have more BTC and just keep beating you until you're dead.
Another idea would be to bury a key in a PVC pipe at a know location and convince anyone trying to get your BTC that you need to go there.  Dig up the key, but also place a hand gun inside so you can blow their heads off and save your life.
Yet another would be to make arrangements with a 3rd party to be ready to assist you (weapons drawn) if they see particular BTC move on the web.  When you captors want more BTC, just explain that you have placed more keys at a particular location.  Your 3rd party backup will be waiting.

associated bitcoin and fraud.  Fraud is illegal.  Do you agree?  Fraud should be prosecuted.  Do you agree with that?  The difference between fraud and regulation is that fraud is used as justification for regulation.  Regulation stipulates that you must ask for permission.  But that protection itself has been demonstrated to be pointless as the banks continue to commit fraud and get bailed out.  So, basically, the freedom to compete has been traded for a permission based system that does nothing to protect people.  So you either have:
* Freedom with fraud and scammers 
* No freedom with fraud and scammers.
If you really want to stop fraud, do two things.  1. prosecute fraud and put people in jail.  2. introduce completion that will put the fraudsters out of business.

Basically, providing a photo, or a saved page that is faked and can be shown to be faked is evidence of criminal intent.  Criminal intent is what is needed to put someone in jail.

@_date: 2015-04-21 18:31:34
Yep.  Not bad.  But still, not many people know how to do that.  
Let's look at the logic.
If the vendor ripped you off and you take a snap shot, you've got something to give police.  It's not perfect evidence, but it's better than just telling the police.  Hell, you could even save the page and give them all the files.  If you simply verbally tell them, they've got nothing to go on.  Providing them with the files gives them the ability to try and demonstrate you're lying, and also gives them a way to ask for the vendor logs.  If the vendor is lying or something flaky is going on at the vendor's office, then there's a chance to find problems on the vendor's end.
Look at it this way.  If you're honest, every piece of detail you can provide does not increase your potential arrest.  If you're trying to fabricate something, every piece of detail you provide increases your chances of being arrested.  Also, every piece of detail provided to police makes their job easier to find lies and contradictions.  If you're a police officer and want to get more recognition, you're going to look for the easy arrests, and avoid the hard arrests.

But it dose and will eliminate competition.  There are only so many players who can afford large sums of cash.  Why do you think there's so much innovation in the computing space?  Basically because the cost of entry is very low.  Increase that cost of entry and you're going to stifle innovation.

Business that deal in bitcoin are NOT in the business of transmitting money.  They make profits from trading, selling or exchanging bitcoins.

Tired of saying this.  Let's try a different approach.
Here are two scenarios.  
1. You lie and tell the police that a web site ripped you off.
2. You lie and create a fake photo for the police as evidence.
As a police officer, which scenario would be more actionable?
In scenario 1, the officer has NOTHING to go on but what you've told him, and he'll probably drop the case.  
In the second scenario, he's got a picture (faked), but possibly flawed.  If he finds a flaw he's going to arrest you for fabricating evidence.  So, in the second scenario, he can do forensics on the image.  E.G. time stamp, look at the address where the bitcoins are going and compare the web site address.  The web site address could contain the transaction information where the site can provide logs to verify you visited their site.
How about another two scenarios.
1. You tell the truth and tell the police about a web site that ripped you off.
2. Tell the truth and provide a picture of the web site.
In scenario 1, the officer has NOTHING to go on but what you've told him, and he'll probably drop the case.
In the second scenario, he's got a picture that he might think is fake.  He'll look for a flaw and ask the vendor for server logs to verify the transaction information appearing in the website address.  In the end he'll fail to prove you provided him with a fake photo, but he done some investigation work and possibly figured out that the vendor is lying.

Would you agree on the basis of, "Let's work on removing the bad regulation and financial system first so as to build trust and then regulate the remaining problems."?
The way I look at it is that any type of regulation is going to discourage the small inventors from creating something new and even more disruptive and revolutionary for fear of the gun that comes his way when he missteps some regulation.
The whole reason many people are here is because the existing system sucks balls.  Then when that same system (that has been proven to be corrupt, incompetent and ineffective) wants to assert that bitcoin should be regulated, people reject it as bunkum.  Well, they're right.  The argument that the existing system should regulate bitcoin is bunk, because it's credibility is shit.
Basically, if you want to sell regulation to the bitcoin crowd, first you've got to clean up the existing system and prove that regulation can and does work.  But by the time you do that, Bitcoin would fail, because you'd have a system that was not corrupt and worked better than bitcoin.  There'd be no need for for an alternative that worked around the system.

By regulation, you basically say that something that a moral person would do must now have permission blessed by some agency of force, and to send that person to jail if he or she fails to ask for permission first.
By regulating bitcoin, you're basically saying that using bitcoin is inherently dangerous and you must ask for permission to do so.
I would really like to know specific breakdowns of what dangers there are and what can be solved via character and reputation.  As it stands, people don't have to depend on the reputation of others because "the government takes care of it", and thus people have become lazy about verifying what they are investing in and who they are giving their money to.  The risk becomes someone else's concern.  (If we're talking about "consumer protection".)  If you're regulating on the basis of "money laundering", I would start to attack the very basis of most drug laws (as that is where much of the "laundering" happens), and point at that these laws are actually the cause for much more evil that they pretend to protect society from.  If you're regulating on the basis of "tax evasion" I would point out that the majority of our "tax dollar" goes to paying off the federal debt (in the form of bonds issued to keep the money supply from causing to much inflation)... the root of this problem itself being the Federal Reserve and the regulation built up around it.
There's only a very small amount of "crime" that could be solved via "regulation", and the existing regulation creates so much more moral hazard as to putting the idea that "a tiny bit of regulation is good" to shame.  If the objective is to create a better world, start by REMOVING harmful regulation first.  Get the bad stuff out of the way.  Perhaps prosecute those banks that committed fraud to begin with, and bind the government in such a way as to prevent it from creating wars, imprisoning people for victimless crimes, creating mass surveillance, funding a drug war (which has caused 50k deaths) in Mexico via criminalizing drugs, and limiting our rights by creating a regulation nightmare, where the smallest action to make a living can put you in jail.
Do this first, then we can talk about solving the remaining problems with a bit of regulation.

Well, then instead of using a gun to issue "regulation", why not issue a government "certification" that they must renew every 3 months, sort of like the USDA certified meats.  Basically it grades the safety of the business and its practices and perhaps "insures" the funds (FDIC Insured).  The "certification" is not mandatory except when dealing with particular businesses or governmental agencies.
EDIT: Not ideal, but make every business that deals with bitcoin that opts NOT to be certified be required to hand out a pamphlet explaining the certifications and how the business is NOT certified.

JPeg is lossy, so re-editing will produce more loss.  Also most cameras have GPS and time stamps.  While the time stamps and GPS can be edited, the lossy problem would be a bit more difficult.  The obvious way to fake it would be to screen capture in BMP, edit, re-display, and snap a photo.  
In any case, it is "some" evidence.  The vendor would have to discount the evidence.  On the positive side, it gives the police two contradictory statements that would mean one or the other party is lying, and falsifying evidence is yet another crime.
EDIT: "cameras" not "camera's"

Section 102: Nothing here mentioning bitcoin or close to bitcoin.
Section 104: "financial product" is as close as you can come to capturing bitcoin, but reading the details of what a "financial product" is, it is clear the intent of these laws were intended for instruments that are BACKED by something and someone.  Bitcoin is not backed nor is it issued by anyone in particular.  This does not capture bitcoin.
Section 201: Since bitcoin is NOT a "financial product", there are no person's falling under Super Nintendo's regulatory authority.
Section 206: Not relevant.  Why is this included?
Section 301: Again, if bitcoin is not captured in section 104, then where's the "Powers of the superintendent" to regulate bitcoin?
Section 302: Ditto. Where's the power of "Regulations by superintendent"?
Section 309: Ditto. If section 104 does not capture bitcoin, then this section is moot.

Its kinda tricky.  If you think about it, real criminals are not going to tell you they're criminals (at least not ones doing a $30k transaction), so if someone says they're doing some sort of crime they're most likely law enforcement.  If you're aware of this, you have to walk away.  If you're not, you're probably honest under normal circumstances but might go ahead anyway.  It's clearly entrapment, as the criminals doing $30k transactions would demand a much higher cut and would walk away on such a small cut.
Me?  I would not do such a large transactions, but if someone did say they were doing illegal activities, I'd be pissed and call them out as law enforcement and tell them that they were stealing my time and effort, and demand they pay me the commission for fucking up an otherwise legal transaction.

Keep saying this over and over.  It IS evidence.  It may not be perfect, but it is stronger than just saying you sent coins to the vendor's site.  Also, if you fake a web page, and the vendor is able to demonstrate that it is a fake, you're in deeper trouble for faking the page, because your fake becomes evidence AGAINST you for falsifying evidence.
Basically, taking a picture ups the stakes of lying.  If you didn't take a picture, the vendor can say nothing happened and the police can just give up and say "its your word against his".  If you provide a picture, then either you're lying and falsifying evidence, or the vendor's doing flaking stuff.

Depends on the level of detail, and saving the web site files, and/or taking a picture gets you more detail with a lot less effort.  In general, you're going to get more details if you provide a picture or files.


Yes, this is true.  But what's the objective (if you're telling the truth)?  If you're telling the truth, your objective is to get your money back and see the vendor get charged with theft.  In that case, you want the police to investigate.
If you're the police and you have two cases and can only investigate one case, are you going to go with the case that has a hand written detail, or are you going to take the case with a picture and lots of digital files and detail?  More detail gives the police more to go on and a higher chance of finding someone lying or committing a crime (either theft or fabricating evidence).


That's possible.  But, again, to your ultimate objective... you want to recover your funds and catch the bad guy, or at least prevent him from thieving again.  So, if you provide poor detail, the police are likely to do nothing.  However, if you provide good detail, the police could question the vendor, and the vendor might figure out who the MITM is or perhaps figure out that their web system does not protect customers enough and decides to refund your money and fix their site.


I think this is where everyone is getting hung up.  "prove" is to strong a word.  Perhaps a better word is "demonstrate" and "provide evidence".  The objective should be to stack the odds in your favor so something good happens.

This guy has a good point that because the profit amount on these funds is so low it demonstrates that this defendant did not have "intent".

Yes, but there's always a chance that you fuck up.  What happens when you make a mistake that would prove your image is a fake?
Providing either a picture, snapshot or saving all the HTML to your hard drive adds credence to your claim because it increases the risk if you're lying.

@_date: 2015-04-02 03:29:43
I think slavik0329's point is correct.  If you have that type of money to invest in software, its going to be a bad investment.
If you want to step back for a moment and re-examine what's wrong with the internet and open source software, it has to do with lack of funding and state interference in for profit software.  Open source software simply cannot compete with closed source for profit software.  I would propose that you re-invent open source computing (software first, then hardware) so that it is self funding, and self contributing.
What do I mean?  Consider an open source software that requires payment (in bitcoin) for the number of hours you use the software.  Start with a video game, and charge 5 cents per hour to use.  The average user buys $1 worth to start and can play for 20 hours before he has to buy more time.  If a user spends 3 hours per day on his favorite game, that's ~$54 per year per user.  Now if you have 50k users, that's $2.7 million per year.  
Now use the revenue from this game and distribute funds to developers who improve the game.  Use 10 or 20% to invent more games with the same revenue model.  Continue to grow this model to include a modified version of BSD that can be modified and copy written.  Again, charge 5 cents per hour to use the OS, but continue to improve it (make it more and more secure). For users who cannot afford the 5 cents per hour, create jobs/tasks that can be done to fund their use of the software.
Add movies, books and music that is exclusive to this platform (but is open source for anyone to modify within the system).  Again, only charge 5 cents per hour to use, and spend 80 to 90% to contributors, and 10 to 20% in new open source projects.  
Now use the revenue streams to invent more secure open source hardware that anyone can view modify and use within this system.  Include things like tablets and cell phones.  Aim to create systems that are secure and encourage people to look for flaws (make this a way to contribute).
The final investments: Continue to use the 10 or 20% revenues to invest in things outside the sphere of computing like doing studies, or funding research.  Leave the final investments up to those contributing to the platform.  Use a [Alternative Voting]( to avoid the spoiler effects in voting.
TLDR; Don't throw money at a new infrastructure, invent a pay per use computing system that self funds contributions and evolves a new computing model.
EDIT: I'm not sure if I was clear, but anyone could step in and contribute to such a system on any level they see fit.  It would be totally open source, and users and contributors would rate the merit of each contribution so that they can receive bitcoin for their efforts.  Trying to control such a system would be poison, so it has to be totally open for all to see and modify.

Further government regulation has NOT protected people from the banking failures.  Far from it.  Regulatory agencies are a FAILURE and has actually increased the burden on the average taxpayer by bailing out the fraudulent banking system.

Established players in any industry can secure their position if regulatory agencies get involved.  It has to do with the expense of compliance rules.  If it costs say $10k per month to comply with regulatory demands and your ISP is small and only makes say $100k per month, you're spending 10% of your revenue on compliance.  If you're a big ISP like Comcast, $10k per month is chump change. Basically regulation serves as a barrier to entry.

The thing that is so attractive to bitcoin is that it is frictionless.  Any system that the government makes is going to have way to much friction.  This is also why they'll never be able to eliminate cash.  There's always friction in the form of "who are you", "wait a day so we can make sure you're not doing something we don't want you to do", "you can't send money to that person".  The government cannot ban bitcoin.  They can only control the "choke points" (banks and exchanges).

So what happens when you have mixed coins and go to buy something?  The vendor will get the coins and then go to the exchange to turn them in to Euro's, but the exchange will look at the coins and decide that they have bad history and block the coins.  The merchant will then either have to start asking lots of questions about anyone using bitcoin to buy something.

From a fragility and historical perspective, regulation has proven to be a poison.  PayPal is a perfect example.  Other companies who've attempted to create systems also failed (Google, and Apple). 
Also, your argument that standardization of regulation is better than a patch of individual state regulators work does not fly.  A monolithic regulatory system makes things fragile, where as a patchwork (although harmful to individual states attempting to regulate) encourages lots of small experiments, where some states will fail, others will succeed (by no or very light regulation).  The only thing a standard national code will do is encourage big business players with deep and corrupting pockets of money to control a central point of failure.  Standardization encourages graft on a much larger scale than a patchwork.

What needs to happen is that coin mixing needs to be a bitcoin standard.  This gives plausible deniability to anyone taking coins.  If law enforcement still needs to track coins, they can still do so by creating their own mixing services and injecting their own coins so as to defeat criminal mixing.  This preserves bitcoin fungibility (alleviates the burden of accepting bitcoin) and law enforcement's desire to track criminal proceeds.

You are correct in that the coins can be split up and "mixed" to the point where they are indistinguishable between normal coins.  The problem is that if the coins are poorly mixed or unmixed and sold (or traded for goods) to some unlucky guy that does not know how to mix them, then he'll have a bad day when he goes to sell or use the coins.

It's a ritual to CYA.  It's also a judgement call.  "How difficult would it be to convince a jury that I did due diligence?"




Why should it (your phrase "We shouldn't have to actively verify others' morality or the legitimacy") have to be about morality.  If we are talking about a society that uses force (e.g. put you in jail for not doing something), then how does morality or ethics play?  If someone puts a gun to your head and tells you to do something, then you're no longer morally responsible.  Its now only a matter of consequences.  You can follow the orders or not.
The point is that in a society that seeks an authority figure to use force against members of that society, the ethical person is no longer morally responsible for his or her actions (in instances where government initiates force).  If the society does not use force (except when someone else initiates force), then you are free to chose and you are morally responsible for your actions.

Its a problem with perception.  If bitcoin is perceived as being un-fungible, then people will find it less attractive.  If I buy bitcoin in Argentina but the U.S. has strict rules about not taking stolen coins, then no matter what Argentina does, I know I cannot safely buy things from the U.S. marketplace.  Further, if I'm buying things online, there's no telling if the site is hosted in the U.K., U.S. or Argentina, or if the funds will flow through one of those countries.
Thus, it matters a great deal how fungible bitcoin is, no matter where bitcoin is used.  If coins can be rejected, acceptance decreases, as does the value and exchange rate.

I don't envy your predicament.  But there's many other things that can be done to address the drug problem besides prohibition.
For one, there's an African root/drug called Ibogaine that has the effect of resetting the brain's chemical (not psychological) addiction to bypass withdrawal.  It's called Ibogaine, but it is classified as a schedule 1 drug because of its hallucinogenic properties.  No one in their right mind would use it as a recreational drug because it's side effects includes vomiting and incapacitation for a few days.  Treatment centers can be found in Canada and Mexico. (Note that this is not a catch all, as there's still a psychological predilection to drug use, so these centers offer counseling as well.)
Another is to address child abuse.  There's a high correlation between childhood abuse and addiction indicating that trauma actually damages the brain and when people use drugs later in life, they get a taste of what it is to feel normal.  Thus these people end up chasing that high that un-abused people need not chase.  So, if child abuse can be addressed another large portion of the drug problem can be abated (in a generation or so).
[The Bomb in the Brain]( - Libertarian philosopher does an excellent job of listing the dangers of child abuse, if you wish to research further.
Another interesting aspect is [Portugal's drug decriminalization](  Indications are that drug use has been cut in half by diverting funds from enforcement to treatment.
I cannot say that these will solve your problem, but if we are to advance as a civilization, we need to abandon prohibition in favor of treatment, because prohibition creates side effects (twisted incentives) that are far worse than drug use itself.

Yes, but bitcoin has the momentum at the moment, and if it gets it wrong, the standard will be set incorrectly.  Simply look back to how email was harassed into being un-encrypted by the military organizations that claimed encryption was a military weapon and could not be exported.  Everyone was terrified of putting encryption into email programs, and so by default 99% of email is now un-encrypted, making the remaining 1% who use encryption targets.
The solution will have to happen in bitcoin, or the standard will be set and we'll lose the battle.

No, actually, it can be a lot worse.  Merchants who accept bitcoin could fall under scrutiny if they start getting coins that are "tainted" (almost all merchants currently turn coins into fiat via exchanges).  The merchants would have to reconsider using bitcoin, or simply start asking every customer all sorts of invasive questions.  This has already happened to customers trading coins on various exchanges, where they get coins from unknown sources and then end up having to provide a buttload more information.  Most businesses that takes bitcoin would not tolerate such an expense and would exit the bitcoin market.

What's far more disastrous than Bitcoin insecurity, is the existing computing infrastructure that could come under attack if Quanum computers become common.  According to what everyone is saying, Bitcoin could simply disallow key re-use to avoid problems, but what about all the rest of the infrastructure?  Software updates (windows and Linux) depend on key signatures.  If Quantum computer's become a reality, these keys are re-used over and over to sign software updates.  Imagine running Bitcoin core, only to have the OS crumble under your feet.
Before anyone starts worrying about the security of Bitcoin, we should really be worrying about the security of the underlying OS and computer infrastructure first.

How about a bitcoin "check" that has funds stored on it and a "change" address where change can be sent.  Before going to the store, simply fill it with enough bitcoins to make your purchase.  A merchant would uncover and scan the private key and the "change" address.  The merchant's computer would scan the private key and split the amounts between their own wallet address and your "change" address would receive any remaining funds.
Drawback is that the merchant could cheat and take all the funds and not give you change.  You would not be able to verify until you got home to verify the transactions.  You would basically have to trust your merchants not to cheat.
Added idea, chain your checks so that the "change" address for check 001 is the address for check 002, and the "change" address for check 002 is the address for check 003, etc.

It's NOT a problem with bitcoin, but rather the existing banking system that demands so much information.
Idea: With such liquidity problems in your area and fees upward of 25%, perhaps your business could offer low volume bitcoin trading for say 5 or 10 percent.  Offer to buy at say 5% below and sell at something like 10% above.  This will give you some BTC to work with.  Be sure to only do low volume trades of like $100-$200 dollars, or your bank may get jealous and close your business account.  Regulators may decide you're worth going after if your volume is to high.

I think the DOJ is doing what the FBI did to LavaBit email service.  LavaBit could not decrypt the email without first backdooring their web page to capture the keys.  LavaBit proved the space and the request to access to the internet, but refused to provide them with the SSL keys until the courts demanded they provide the SSL keys so the FBI could do a man in the middle attack.
This is basically what the DOJ is trying to do.  They are trying to make Apple modify their software so that when people go to update their iPhones the DoJ can capture the keys.
The best thing Apple could do at this point to technically thwart the DoJ is to OpenSource those crypto modules and then make the distribution of those modules distributed.  This would make it near impossible for the DoJ to get leverage over the software.
As we are learning any point of centralization will be attacked, and that is exactly what the DoJ and government is doing.

Yes, but that's not my point. The point is that when regulations get involved, things get onerous and inefficient, and kills any advantage bitcoin has over traditional dollars and forms of banking. 
Take for example regulations requiring the rejection of any coin by a merchant that appears to have been used in a crime.  Thus when buying something you get a message "Your coins were not accepted.  Contact BitPay.com at xxx-xxx-xxxx.".  While you simply bought coins at localbitcoin.com and are innocent of committing a crime, now you're going to abandon bitcoin because its a nightmare to use.

If you set up an exchange, you do it under the pretense that the money is not going to be used for other things.  Unless you specifically say that you are going to use it for other things in the terms, then its fraudulent.  The difference is because the banking laws and regulations have changed over the past 150 years, its now "common practice" to do those types of things.

Simple precautions.  A pawn shop make it a business, therefore they have a little more burden than the average Joe.  Not that they have to do much.  Something like "Where did you get this item?", and if the answer sounds crazy or like it was stolen, then they've got to turn down the deal.  If they did not employ precautions they would end up with lots of stolen goods, and if they continually got visits from the police to recover stolen goods, then it might be construed that they are knowingly taking stolen goods.  Taking that minimal extra precaution gives them plausible deniability.
This is also why an exchange will end up rejecting coins, because an automated script can easily check the coins and if they are to tainted they will be rejected.  It's an easy plausible and reasonable action to ensure plausible deniability.  "We didn't know they coins were ripped off.  We ran a script and it did not turn up anything."  Whereas, if they did not and they continued to sell coins without doing so, they might be accused of selling stolen coins.  "Its such a simple process.  Simply run a script and it will indicate if the coins are stolen.  Why didn't you at least do that?!?"
With a person to person exchange, its a bit different.  An average user would not be expected to run a script each time he gets coins.  That's not the average person's specialty.

They have the right to not accept the funds.  However, this highlights a serious problem of fungability.  Some coins are better than others.  This will cause a problem for people accepting coins that don't have the ability to identify "tainted" coins.  This will make bitcoin less attractive than say dark coin that has much better fungability.
Imagine that an associate sells you 10 BTC, and in 6 months or so after you leave your job for another, you decide you want to liquidate those coins.  Now when you go to the exchange to sell them, you get a shocker.  You cannot sell them.  What is going to be the reaction the next time you go to buy BTC?  You're going to be fearful that you'll get tainted coins, and will be less likely to take coins from unknown sources.
Now apply this to a business that takes BTC.  The owner takes 5 BTC as payment for some item, and then goes to an exchange to sell the coins.  However, because his customer used tainted coins, he's now facing a problem of getting cash he needs to buy more product.  What's he going to do?  Well, he's going to abandon bitcoin.
If someone stole gold coins, there would be no way to determine if they were stolen, and people would much more readily take gold coins, because they would not be afraid that they would be labeled as stolen and just as redeemable as any other gold coin.
While theft and other crime are a problem accepting that it is OK to track the history of coins will only make it easier for "regulators" to step in and mandate that this be done.  It's a back door argument for "regulation" which can be a bitcoin killer if not kept in check.

Well, if you are talking about "natural law" or the variation of the concept, then yes, breaking "natural law" is wrong.  However, we are talking about man made laws, and the ones violate what is commonly referred to as "natural law" are immoral.  If you're hung up on "the law is right and violating the law is wrong" then you're brainwashed and can't really think for yourself.


No doubt.  I've been warning people here not to violate the law even if the laws are immoral.  There's wright and wrong, and then there's legal and illegal.  The point is to distinguish the law from what is right and wrong.  It is your right to sell drugs to people (e.g. "natural right"), but the law (man made law) says otherwise and imposes an artificial consequence to deter people from doing it.


No, I'm suggesting you stop siding with what is obviously an immoral law, and call it out as such.

I've outlined ways to create trusted transactions without compromising privacy.  GreenAddress white listing is not needed.  What is needed is a change to the locking mechanism and the way multi-signature works.
* A recognized trusted third party sets up shop.  Their purpose is to sign multi-signature addresses once and only once.  They will only sign multi-signature addresses from anonymous persons whom have initiated a signature of a multi-signature address.  The important part is that the trusted party will only sign once, and everyone trusts that they only sign once.
* To set up this transaction, a privacy minded person pays the trusted party to set up this trusted multi-signature address.
* The privacy minded person then sends funds to the multi-signature address.
* Here's the trick.  The multi-signature address is only valid for a set number of blocks.  After it expires, it becomes a single signature address where only the privacy minded person's signature is required to spend the funds.
In short, GreenAddress white listing is not required and people can retain their privacy.  Blockstream's purchase of GreenAddress is strange in the face of just writing code to both protect people's privacy and to accomplish trusted zero-conf transactions.

Another idea.
A few years back, I wanted a copy of an old soundtrack.  The soundtrack was selling for $50 used on amazon.com.  The record company had stopped production of the CD, and I was unwilling to spend $50 that would normally cost $6 to $10.  So, I searched for the music in an MP3 format.  I ended up on a few Russian MP3 web sites that sold the tracks for $.05 to $.12 each.  I basically tried to add credits to this web site, only to have Visa block the transaction.  I tried a few more Russian web sites, but but with no luck.
Basically, since Visa blocks sending funds to these sites, we should ask them to accept BitCoins instead.

No it would not.  Before the federal reserve, banks were issuing notes (bank currency) that was based on fractional reserves.  Due to the problems with correct backing and bank failures, the market created a book that listed the rating of the bank and how much a bank note should be discounted from its face value.  In other words, the market WAS solving the problem of fraudulent banking (fractional reserve banking) without any regulation.
Regulation is NOT needed.  In fact its actually a detriment to the well being of everyone, because, creating regulation makes the systems much more fragile and exposed to corruption at a central point.

Further, if bitcoin does not accommodate anonymity competition like Monero and Dash are going to provide what bitcoin fails to.  luke-jr is on the development team for Bitcoin, and his statement shows he's not interested in privacy which shows he's not looking out for what users want.


Bitcoin WAS anonymous, until wankers started tracking everything.  Bitcoin WAS intended to be anonymous.  Tell me... who is Satoshi?  If bitcoin was not designed to be anonymous, how the hell did Satoshi keep his identity hidden?

1. Do you really think I'm talking about the block chain?  EDIT: Sorry.  Most merchants use BitPay or some exchange to turn the coins into dollars.  Hope that clarifies.
2. Again, regulation can "take care" of that. 
3. Not entirely untrue, but mostly.  The U.S. puts enormous pressure on other countries to get its way.  Just look to the existing banking treaties with regards to ex-pats and how banks will now refuse service to Americans or former Americans.  The bright spot is that the American empire is waning and other countries are trying to change the rules.
4. Yes, bitcoin is global.
Summary: While it will be impossible to "stop" bitcoin, regulators can hamper or instill fear of using it.  The point is that we should not buy the line (lie) that bitcoin needs regulation.  We should resist (speak out against) regulation to give bitcoin a better chance of becoming more main stream.

While you post sounds innocuous, it only serves as an attempt to disarm those voices that are railing against the regulators.  
While bitcoin is starting to go main stream, you fail to realize (or do and your intent is hidden) the threat regulation (and the existing banking system) still poses to bitcoin.  **Regulation is DANGEROUS to bitcoin**, and to ignore it or to invite it in is foolish.  Any industry that faces regulation becomes a marriage between monopoly corporations and the state, or is used as a weapon against upstarts who wish to challenge the status-quo.  Two things can happen if regulators can con us into accepting their authority.  1.) Bitcoin becomes main stream, but is heavily regulated, and creating new and different versions is prohibited.  (innovation is stifled)  2.) Bitcoin is so heavily regulated that it is blocked from going main stream.
If you want to see what regulation can do, simply look to PayPal.  PayPal was created as a way to make it easy to make person to person payments.  Now it is so heavly regulated that there's no real way to pay people without reams of disclaimers and he possibility of NOT getting paid.  Worse, your funds can be frozen.  Other examples can also be seen in our existing exchanges with horror stories of people's bitcoins being frozen, or how the existing banking regime has been forcing banks to close people's accounts (like porn starts and gun dealers).
We MUST fight regulation because the history of regulation is clear.  It is counter to the intent of bitcoin and degrades value and usefulness of bitcoin with the guns of the government.
EDIT: "and the state".
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:11:15

So, dissecting the Vermont code, I cannot find her reference to "digital record".  But I did find the definitions and here's something interesting:
[Title 8 Chapter 79 Sub-chapter 001](
(4) "Currency exchange" means receipt of revenues equal to or greater than five percent of total revenues from the exchange of money of one government for money of another government.
NOTE: This section specifically states "government currency" so as to not involve gold and silver.  Given that Bitcoin is not a "government" money, a bitcoin ATM is not a currency exchange by the legal definition given in this title and subsection.
(11) "Money transmission" means to engage in the business of selling or issuing payment instruments, selling or issuing stored value, or receiving money or monetary value for transmission to a location within or outside the United States.
The purpose of a Bitcoin ATM is NOT to transmit money, it is to exchange government currency to a non-government currency (like gold or silver), or from non-government currency to government currency.  Just because bitcoin is in the internet and can be sent across state lines does not automatically make a bitcoin ATM a money transmission service.
**So, I call bullshit on Vermont's Finance Commissioner**.  There is no reference to "digital record" and a bitcoin ATM is neither a currency exchange (via the legal definition) nor is it a "money transmission" service.

Bitcoin only specifies the condition for allowing coins to be spent, not a condition of distributing coins in the future.

The idea is that they shape how people use bitcoin so that you must use trusted coins in order to buy and sell stuff.  You would still be able to use bitcoin, but the private coins would be associated more and more with illegal activities.
The writing is on the wall, privacy needs to be established as a prerequisite for using bitcoin.  Unmixed coins need to be shunned as less valuable than mixed coins.  Otherwise, simply start moving to a different coin that enforces privacy before the system can be established that coin mixing is a regulated activity or that KYC must be met in order to sell stuff for bitcoin.

"Privacy is a privilege extended by government to people obeying the law."
Wrong.  It's a right not a privilege.  This guy is of the philosophy that government is the arbiter of privacy.  This is in total opposition to the 4th amendment of the constitution.  The constitution is a contract whereby people grant the government the privileged of doing things in their name.
Rights are inherent in our biology.  Violate one of those rights without good justification and there is a desire to harm the offender.  To spy on someone without their consent generates hated and the desire for revenge.  To say that government grants the privilege of privacy is to say "we have the guns, but we'll let you do stuff".

Well, if a store of value can be conditionally transferred, then IPO's would prefer Ethereum over bitcoin as a method of payment.  If I were trying to re-create a stock market built ontop of a crypto currency, I would want a system where conditional distributions were "distribute" instead of centralized to prevent fraud.  Bitcoin, as far as I know, does not "distribute" this calculation.  A central authority is needed to transfer the funds to one address instead of a different address.

Centralization always attracts people who crave power and control, usually psychopaths and bad people.  That's why we should always be wary of centralization.


The counter argument is that core and the lack of opposing viewpoints is BAD centralization.  There is much that is missing in the way of opposing viewpoints because those voicing a different view are often removed.  Even now, I have to watch what I say very carefully, even to just retain the ability to warn others.  There is much that I cannot mention here.
What's further, without the opposing views, there has developed a major rift in the bitcoin community.  This rift has put many off from promoting bitcoin and focused valuable energy trying to combat the problem.

The rules are not written and everyone is cheering the decision.  You have to remember that the FCC is a hammer and is used to threaten TV and radio broadcasters.  If you say something that pisses the FCC or influential people off, you could run into trouble with renewing  your license.  Further, the FCC IS an organization of censorship, exactly the opposite of what the NN'ers are advocating against.
Another problem with highly regulated industries is that they often serve as barriers to competition.  Basically the small ISP's will have more overhead per revenue to take care of compliance rules, while the big ISP's enjoy low overhead for compliance compared to revenue.
The final problem is that of control creep.  If the FCC gets its way and is able to claim regulatory domain over the internet, it is likely to be a target for law makers to do things such as blocking porn (Think of the children!).  This has happened already in the UK.  While it seems harmless, because most porn sites are really not interested in giving access to those who don't view porn, it is again a weapon for hiding content and destroying sites that are politically active.  This happens by simply labeling a site as "adult" even though it may have very little "adult" content.  When this happens, all internet traffic (and revenue!) going to that site is cut by 50 to 80%, all because someone in Washington decided that your site had porn on it.  What complicates this is that sites like reddit that server both non-porn links AND porn links, could be blocked and would have to decided to go strictly porn or no-porn to get around the blocks.
So, these are just a few potential problems that the progressives are overlooking, and unfortunately, explaining all this only get's you labeled as a "Republican" or "kotch shill".

Also, I'll point out that the war on drugs is a whole different evil that most people don't understand.  It has been known since the 70's (via the rat park drug experiments) that the cause of addiction is sociological.  Thus the war on drugs and all the buildup of the police state in violation of the constitution based on the idea that drugs cause a decline of society, is a farce.  It is actually the other way around.  The decline of society and poor and stressful environment is the cause of drug use, not the effect.

The main problem is with rubber hose attacks.  As people start using bitcoin and spend bitcoin, removing privacy basically threatens people's physical security.  If someone knows that you have at least say $100k of bitcoin by looking at where the coins come from can pass that information to someone else inadvertently.  Such  information can be dangerous and potentially deadly in the wrong hands.
With the traditional banking system, it is difficult, if not impossible to use a rubber hose attack, but bitcoin opens up a whole new threat that is not being addressed.  Even users of gold and silver can isolate such information and thus limit their risk.  With bitcoin, extra steps are required that only a computer savvy programmer would love.
Existing tech to mix coins:  These technologies are good for the tech savvy, but for the average user, they lack ease of use.  What's more, if the transaction fees continue to rise to high, the on chain swaps, coinjoins and such will simply become to expensive to use.  If the plan is to keep the current block size small, there's going to be a need for a trustless off chain swapping system to help people protect their privacy.

I don't agree with your dystopian future.
For those entities that depend on infrastructure and low crime rate, paying taxes or facilitating order will be paramount.  The burden will shift from the current wage slaves to large corporations.  Without order, these corporations cannot exist, and it is in their best interest to ensure stability.  Also, as un-touchable as bitcoin may be, physical assets still need to be obtained and maintained.  These assets can still be force ably taken or "taxed".  In essence, bitcoin will force a tax on the "rich", and the small time spender will surf below the radar tax free.
What will become impossible is the full scale war of prior generations, as there is no way to raise funding.  There will be no money assets worth taking, and controlling natural resources will be impossible without the cooperation of everyone.  Anyone seeking to dominate a resource will quickly find it destroyed or spoiled from disgruntled parties that have been shut out of their share.
Further, the current system is extremely unfair as the U.S. uses force, deception, and propaganda to overthrow governments who try to establish their own independence from the dollar.  This also does not take into account the millions who have been killed or maimed because of this money system.  While the U.S. may experience hyper-inflation, and those who've worked their entire lives to save for retirement, their suffering pales in comparison to the tears shed by those living under U.S. occupation.

We all need to acknowledge that the banking industry has a legitimate problem with bitcoins due to its criminal incentives.  Thieves can hack bank accounts and send funds to an exchange or to a hapless localbitcoins.com vendor.  This causes all sorts of problems for the banks because now they can be innodated with fraud issues.
Consider a moment what happened to PayPal with regards to buying and selling virtual goods (MMO accounts, WoW gold, etc.).  They simply disallow it because there is to much fraud going on in that market.  The banks have the same problem, and will often avoid or discourage transactions that have the potential of being dodgy, because it impacts their other customers.  When this happens, they either have to tell the victim of identity theft "tough luck", and end up having lots of customers hear about how the bank fucked up on security, or make the buyer pay the price and reverse the transaction.
Let's face it, the banks shield us from a lot of shitty transactions by refusing to operate with particular vendors.  Think about it, China walled off their banking system from bitcoins for this exact reason.  The incentive for theft and fraud is pernicious. Simply look at the number of fraud and thefts recorded in The banking industry (while it does have a vested interest in the status quo) will have a good argument for not operating with people who deal in bitcoins.

They supposedly exist to track drug money, but we all know that the criminal drug laws do nothing except to destroy society and drain the wealth from the middle and lower classes.  Drug use is a health issue and should be approach in that manner.
Secondly, no amount of regulations that may apply to bitcoin is a positive thing.  Regulations only help corrupt wealth and powerful people that can grease the wheels via lobbying or bribery.  Just look at the major banks and how they avoid prosecution for "money laundering", and at the same time get welfare via "bailouts".  There is nothing positive about this.

Yes, but a month ago, the price (in dollars) was $25.  So, the ratio of dollar bits to price has only doubled.  Further, if you think about the ratio of bids following the price, the area under those graphs would logically get exponentially larger as the price moved up.  Therefore, it does logically follow that there are a lot of people waiting for orders to execute relative to the exchange rate.  Basically, the open orders are reflective of the current "interest" in bitcoin, and not something special.

Sales in BTC are a small percentage for most merchants.  Also, most merchants who accept VISA and MasterCard face a 2 to 5% charge.  If the potential loss is say 20% in a very small window (say less than 5% of the time), then they are still ahead of the game when comparing to CC chages.
I would agree that there are merchants who do face serious problems.  Coinabul.com will probably face some losses as people started ordering gold when the price was collapsing.

Someone once shared with me the keys to marketing.
Imagine a bottle of caster oil.  Now imagine an ice cream cone (a funnel cone) sitting on top of the bottle of caster oil with its tip inside the top of the bottle.  Then imagine a balance scale on top of that ice cream cone where the scales can tip either way.  Then picture the capital building sitting on top of the scale on the crux of the scale.  Finally imagine a big flag flying on top of the capital building with the letters "DBM".  If you can picture all of this, you will remember everything that follows.
* The caster oil is what the customer needs. (Tastes terrible, but is what is needed.)
* The ice cream cone is what the customer wants.
* The scale represents the ability to make a buying decision (E.G. Are you dealing with someone who can make the decision?).
* The capital building represents the money (E.G. Are you dealing with someone who can afford your product?)
* The letters on the flag (DBM) represent "Dominant Buying Motive".
In order to "make a deal" you start asking questions about what the customer wants (ice cream cone), and determine if you can supply the need (caster oil).  Next ask who would be able to make the decision to buy your service product.  If you are not dealing with a decision maker, you can't make a deal.  Once you are dealing with a decision maker, ask how much the are currently spending on their "problem".  If they can't pay for your solution or product, then you can't make a deal.  Finally, ask them questions about "painful" aspect of their current problem or ask them what criteria would make them buy or use a different service or product (the "Dominant Buying Motive").
Once all these pieces are in place all you have to do is keep pointing out that your product or service solves their "Dominant Buying Motive".

Just a couple of thoughts.
1.  Bitcoin and money in general tends to be amoral, and people don't think much about taking money or giving money to bad people.  This is a reason the "state" tends to justify their money laundering laws and monitoring the cash that floats through the banking system.  Unfortunately, the banks have proven to be more criminal and damaging than all other thieves combined (and the state does nothing about it).
2. Try to use your gut when trading with people.  Are they reputable?  Are there tell tell signs that the person has low moral values? (e.g. Does the person litter, talk about friends getting into trouble with the law, or perhaps espouse of violent actions?)
3. Be a little nosy about the people you are dealing with.  "So, what do you do for a living?" "How was your x-mass?  Did you visit family?" "You aren't going to use these bitcoins to do anything illegal, are you?"  This will discourage those who are doing shady activities from dealing with you because they don't want the po-po to gather the information from you when you get questioned.  (If you really want to discourage the criminal types, ask to take a photograph of their ID.)
4. Spend the cash one time before putting it into the bank.  This is the hard part that large scale criminals don't have time to do.  But, because the banking system is fucked, and because the state is now harassing people for trading bitcoin, its the next logical step in protecting against police harassment.  Had the system jailed the bankers and offered an honest money system, we would not be resorting to this process.
5. Consider un-banking, or at least keeping just enough in your bank account to take care of bills.  Do the rest in BTC (or cash, if you must).

Yep.  The real crime is aiding and abetting criminal activity, if you do it knowingly.  However, if you are simply helping someone protect their privacy, the crime is fallacious.  There are actually legitimate reasons for wishing to protect your privacy.  For example, if you have a large sum of cash or bitcoins or whatever, keeping people from knowing that you have a large stash can actually save your life.  To mix coins for this reason is a legitimate reason for "washing" coins.

Not likely because there many more merchants taking it as a means of exchange.  Once merchants accept it, there's no reason they would stop accepting it.  Thus even if it is a bubble, the down side will still be a lot softer than the last one.


Yes, the second bubble has seriously damaged the long term perspectives.  But those who want an alternative to the current banking system have been warning that bitcoin has this limitation.
I kinda suspect that this is the existing money powers are waging war against bitcoin.  It will all depend on how well people believe in the ideal of an alternative currency vs. the big banks that are screwing us right now.  The believers/idealists will put value in, those without conviction will jump to anything that will make them quick riches.

There are ways to make a crypto currency more stable, but there would be no incentive to spread it if it were not limited.  Gold and silver tend to be stable because people can stop working and go phsyically mine more gold and silver if the demand for the metals goes up.  
The problem with allowing government or any other entity to control the supply is that they will manipulate the value (quantity) to their advantage (either control or to extract wealth for other uses).  Needing government to stabalize a currency is like needing predators to cull the human population.  We are far better off weathering the ups and downs ourselves.

* Monitoring banking transactions in case you are "money laundering".
* Searching your home, car, or person because you "act suspiciously", "associate with drug dealers", "car smell's like dope", etc.
* Take your money, car, or house because police suspect it was part of drug proceeds.

"sniffs" is probably not the best term.  It is well known that the NSA has demanded back doors to many computer systems as well as the Windows OS.  If the NSA is invading computers (against constitutional law) and wants to increase funding, they could cut a deal with the FBI to piggy back the private keys onto existing confiscations, and the FBI would return the favor in some manner.
The advantage is that the bitcoin community would not be in an uproar over the confiscations because it would seem like a legitimate operation.

So, I tend to get paranoid about government computer hacking.  Couple this attack with being able to tap the power lines and listen to the frequencies generated when it consumes power.  For example what happens when the power companies start using smart meters?  There have been reports that smart meters will be used in the future to track the types of devices you turn on in your home and the time of activation.  (The information will probably be used for marketing purposes.)  This type of information can be determined by placing a digital signal processor in the smart meter.
We seriously need to start funding computer security as bitcoin becomes more and more valuable.  Governments and organized crime will start looking for ways to hack in ways never thought of before.

Other "vendors" have been shipping ugly products that fetch an incredible amount of money per hash rate.

3. People think you are delaying your delivery because you are using the miners to pre-mine on their dime.

Thus, every day delayed get's them suspicious that BFL is cheating them out of their investment.

[quants the alchemists of wall street]( - These traders work on the principle of seeing a trade go across the internet and then create another trade that beats that trade by fractions of a second.  It basically works by cheating the system.
As bitcoin becomes more prevalent and people get used to the volatility or the volatility decreases, the other tricks mentioned in this article will become less and less useful.

Dealing with bitcoins will mean that any exchange a bank deals with will need to have a long hold period (30 days or more... either in BTC or in $) so as to ensure any hackers cannot profit before a hacked account can be identified.  Dealing with exchanges that don't do this will invite all sorts of headaches for your uncle via lots of fraud claims.

Not the weakest link.  The weakest link will be the NSA's built in back doors to hardware and software (not to mention China and other governments).  With these, Bitcoin is basically owned.  Unless everything is open sourced, there's no use pretending that that Bitcoin's value is any greater than basic internet transactions.  In other words, it will be fine for day to day internet transactions, but if it poses a real threat to the existing money system and the powers behind the NSA don't agree to this challenge, then a whole slew of coins will be confiscated and the value will plummet.

We see over and over again that those who attempt to follow the unjustified rules expose themselves to more hazards that those who simply ignore the rules.  e-gold, and Kim Dotcom are perfect examples.  Both attempted to comply with the authorities and only got hammered on some technicality.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't.  The only hope is to make a system so distributed that it's impossible or impractical to enforce, coupled with countering propaganda to show that the rules are arbitrarily enforced in favor of the big banks and to the detriment of the little guys.
