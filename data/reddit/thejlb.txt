Use Gemini, and invest in a good hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger)

I know Trezor does, will let someone else with knowledge chime in if Ledger does as well.

Stop using Coinbase/GDAX and start using exchanges that support the community and your own beliefs. 
The idea that they spent time and effort to bring BCash to us before addressing any of the other glaring issues (support, SegWit, batching transactions, etc.) is a clear message they don't care about us or the community.
Switch to another exchange and speak to them in terms they can understand. If enough people abandon their platform, you can bet they would respond quickly, or wither into obscurity.

I think we, as a community, should make it our mission to see this happens. Coinbase/GDAX don't care about doing what is right, just what is going to line their pockets with cash.

Cryptos, in general, have been moving in lock-step for several weeks. This correction is good and necessary.
The FUD you speak of is shaking out the weak hands, which will come flooding back into crypto when the dust settles. There are a lot of people that simply invested to get rich quick and haven't seen that happen so they are getting out.
In any case, be strong and HODL. The FUD will continue, but will also slowly lose its power to control the masses. You can only claim it is a bubble, ponzi, etc so many times before everyone starts to ignore them.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:16:06
It shouldn't, but there are a lot of weak hands out there that got into crypto just to make a quick buck. Something happened, the price went down a bit and they freaked out.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:14:03
I say let the free market reign. If Coinbase/GDAX doesn't want to support SegWit, hit them where it really counts and move to an exchange that already supports it.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:07:49
Why not buy GBTC?

Investing in crypto is anything but conservative, but I do agree I would rather invest 60k in crypto than invest in mining hardware.

If you are still getting prompted for a 2fa code, it is still enabled on your account. 
Kraken is suffering from the same problems as so many other exchanges that come with rapid growth. They are definitely not the fastest or most efficient, and I have had similar login problems with them. 
Personally I like Gemini for BTC purchases, but if you are looking for access to additional cryptos there are not a whole lot of options. I have used HitBTC for some other crypto purchases that have gone reasonably well, but have had similar login issues there.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:09:28
Said the man who openly admitted to not understanding crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:34:41
Sorry, my bad, you are right. I haven't logged into Kraken in a while. Just tried and it seems I can't get into my account either. :-) I have had problems with this in the past, probably have locked myself out at this point. Ugh.

Coinbase = GDAX
They are the same company and neither is trustworthy. Don't trust your crypto/$ to an exchange, store your funds off exchange. They are not a bank.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:34:53
For crying out loud, make it worth the cost for Coinbase/GDAX already! 
Move to an exchange that already supports SegWit and stop complaining. If people moved away from exchanges that do not support SegWit in droves, you can bet they would do something, and quickly.
The mere fact that their business has not been impacted by not enabling it gives them no incentive to put the effort toward doing it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:49:55
I wouldn't go so far as to say they are the shittiest in existence, but they definitely are not doing the bitcoin community any favors.
I would add that if you are able to setup an account on Coinbase, you will be equally capable of setting up an account on Gemini, and their interface is pretty decent.

Only question I have is why scale in now, why not when it was at 3k? Your TA should have told you the bottom was time to scale in, not 3x the bottom.

Best thing I could recommend, rather than expecting you to take my word for it is to do your own research on hardware wallets, and make your own judgements if they are right for you.

Welcome to Coinbase, where the price you pay is made up and all the customers lose.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:33:57
There are plenty of free options to store your coins off exchange. Pick something you are comfortable and confident with, and do your own research so you understand the options.
Paper wallets are probably the cheapest ways to store coins offline, and depending on your needs you may be fine storing on a app on your phone. (I am not recommending this except for small amounts)

If we assume this chart accurately represents Bitcoin, then we are early in the awareness phase. Institutional investors have been cautious investing in Bitcoin as of yet, but the foundations are being layed for large institutional investments. 2018 should be very interesting times for Bitcoin.
