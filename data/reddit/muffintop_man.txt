You're a fucking idiot
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:52:48
yeah well if it all comes down to the same revenue then what the fuck are you doing exactly? You might not be shooting yourself in the foot yet but you have the gun cocked and ready.

I went on godaddy once to register a .com domain based on my family's surname. I got as far as putting in my cc info and for whatever reason I stopped.
A few days later I went back to finish the process and it was taken, which I thought was odd since it was just available and is a pretty obscure name. A few days after that I got an email from the supposed squatter telling me I could buy it from them for $200.
Godaddy is a shitty fucking scam of a company

What is this? 1997?

Never assume stupid people aren't smart enough to be malicious
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:07:46
how very naive of you.

who is Ghash and why do you trust them to do the right thing?

I have some rocks we can throw

what if they don't care about profit? What if their profit is in the faiulure of cryptocurrencies? 
The whole point of the decentralized nature of bitcoin was the decentralized nature of bitcoin and the people that are in Ghash don't give a shit about anything but short term profit and moving on to the next thing to rape. Trusting pools is dumb, even the ones that can be trusted, and you can tithe a bit to humanity or you can go all-in into a self destructive loop that leaves scorched earth and scorched technology behind it. 
To be a dick, or not to be a dick. That is the question.

Except that's not what idolize means.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:26:36
I don't know why this isn't the main theory as to what happened. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:24:29
ulterior. And yes. Ghash is shady as fuck and doesn't have the future of bitcoin in mind. I wouldn't be surprised in the least if this all leads to an attempted huge crippling attack on the network and it turns out Ghash is a government or banking entity just biding their time until the time to strike is right.
The largest animal migration that existed in modern times is now gone and the animals that once numbered in the billions are now extinct. People can't be trusted to take what they need and not what they think will make them rich and in the end we all lose.

I don't know a single person that idolizes politicians or bankers
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:45:04
Greed is a funny thing. The sheer need for more and more and more eventually leads to nothing. You don't know who Ghash is and you don't know their intentions. Relying on people to do the right thing always ALWAYS ends in disaster. Human beings can't be trusted to be altruistic when the prospect of money is involved even if overdipping the punchbowl will ruin it for everyone.
People are generally fuckwits, don't be like them.

even if it's not an 'evil pool', which it more and more seems to be, it's full of idiots that can't see past tomorrow. Be better, be smarter, live for today *and* tomorrow

If I was BTCGuilld I would point out that when I approached 51% I established steadily increasing mining fees to discourage additional miners and in turn, the destruction of all of our wealth. 
Honestly, I don't know shit about Elgius as I have used bitminter for like a year now but I also don't want anyone adding hashing power to bitminter either. 
WE ALL benefit from the spreading of the wings of bitcoin and to either ignore or deny this fact means you are against us, not with us. Some day decentralized independent confirmation of transactions will be standard. The banking jobs that exist now won't cease to exist, they will exist in different capacities, and literally no one will suffer except the highest of the high of the 1% and everyone else will benefit. This is our opportunity to be the future and not the past and the only people fighting us are either about to lose because of financial tradition or are bought and paid for.

A few summers ago I had a kid from Greece working for me. One day were just sitting around talking about his home and he mentioned both his parents are retired. In my head I picture this 20something year old being the last born into a huge family with him coming when they're in their 40s or something.
Nope. Both parents retired at 45 if I remember correctly. I asked if they were rich and if so what was he doing working for me at $12 an hour. Nope. They were regular people with menial jobs which I can't recall right now but for some reason got to retire with whatever Greece calls full benefits.
Being from NJ and seeing this with cops and county/city employees, and seeing how it's fucking over the population, I realized the Greece is fucked. I had no idea it would come this fast and I had no idea Greeks consider not paying taxes to be the national pastime.
