@_date: 2016-08-03 17:38:09
It's entirely reasonable that a send after an invalidation gets sent automatically to a predefined address (no questions asked and no reversal possible), possibly even a 2nd vault. 
In that way you have the attacker who absolutely needs to know not just the vault key, but the reversal key, and then a third wallet key at the absolute minimum.
And you could very easily set up this vault chaining where you create vaults say 3 levels deep and each vault requires what is effectively 'promotion' to eventually get anything out of it payable to a merchant/individual.
The importance in this scheme would be that usage of the vault key a 2nd time (post invalidation) forces the transaction only move to a predetermined address.
The beauty of this is that if a top level vault has had an invalidation, those coins just end up in a wallet address you control and if there are any deeper vaults the coins can be moved to a new set of vaults. The recommendation in the case there's invalidation of a vault (be it from you or an attacker) should have you immediately re securing coins in a new vault.
While you can keep deep vault coin below an invalidated vault in those vaults, if an invalidation on the transaction occurs it means all coin in that vault will inevitably move toward the top level predetermined address (which is possibly another deeply nested vault).
It really wouldn't bother me to place 1000 BTC in a 6th level vault, while keeping some change like 10 BTC in a 1st or 2nd level vault. Even with some compromised vault keys or reversal keys, the likelihood of anyone ever compromising large BTC amounts out of vaults would be negligible.
Edit: Last but not least, the movement to the predetermined address is at the discretion of the eventual use of the vault key for a 2nd time. That way an invalidation has no immediate effect on movement of funds away from the vault.

Liquidate it. Lol. Perhaps liquidating fiat is the way forward. And perhaps not. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:35:26
Well it's straight forward. The USD is real, but was it obtained through operation as a fractional reserve to pump the market. They could have run fractionally by purchasing stacks of BTC (or other crypto) with USDT they printed freely, and now they're selling that BTC down to cover the calls on USD/USDT but doing so way above the initial gamble. If (and I repaet IF) this was an insider trading scheme that used the trust of Tether as its start point to fraudulently purchase 100s of millions in BTC at low prices, and then capitalise on the sale of that BTC when the FOMO crowd jumped in and added several billion to the real USD backing, what you have there is a get rich quick scheme. So it's whether or not that USDT had USD backing BEFORE or AFTER the price inflation of bitcoin that's really in question.
And what's even more interesting about that is that without prudential oversight they could theoretically get away with it.. all they have to do is sell down enough BTC above their buy in, the market can contract, and then they only have to cover a fraction of what they could have possibly fraudulently loaned/printed themselves. So yes they very well could have $2B+ in a bank account, I'd even suggest it's likely. But were they running fractionally to get there and how far down the rabbit hole do we go?
It could all be completely above board though.

Funnily enough they failed because even their own audit/compliance team failed to do its due diligence on the products they were shoveling.

@_date: 2018-01-31 03:15:46
Well not exactly. Exclude for the moment that you could send the tether to the other exchanges through bad actors and purchase crypto that way which keeps any 'insider trading' off your own market. The reason issuance is important is that its the best way to cover the fraud. Take this scenario... issue USDT to 'yourself' and with it purchase an epic shit ton of market-valued cryptocoin. Then they wait for inflation which is inevitable because supply is shrinking and demand is growing (artificially). Wait for the on-boarding of billions from new investment, and then sell that coin not for USDT but USD at massively inflated prices stemming from your preemptive market move. The USDT held by the original cryptocoin holder is now funded at the original purchase price, the bank accounts are getting stuffed with dollars to back the USDT and another bank account getting stuffed with rainy day money from the inflated sale that came from the fraudulent sale of non-backed USDT.
So yes, to fulfill the seller, they would need to offer USDT irrespective of its backing at that stage. Like I alluded to earlier it's one possibility and one massive gamble in pulling off. It may be absolutely impossible at this stage to determine the truth and which of USD/USDT was the chicken and which the egg. And it may also never reoccur.
Obviously it's all just conjecture at best, but surely people are trying to understand just what is organic and what is all lies. Because we've seen so many other things.

To suggest that reddit is a place of poor advice is just silly on this particular topic compared to say your grandma. I'll give some sound advice.
Sell if the value of your investment has met its initial targets that you originally bought it for. Some people bought it to support the technology, others to get rich off it, some just to make a modest positive gain and then diversify out to something else. All are valid. &lt;-- reasonable advice no??

Yea $400 now was just too low. Hindsight though. Considering just 50btc was worth close to 1million US just last month. That means you'd of needed 2500btc to make that a reality at 400. Hardly anyone had 2500btc.
I always conclude that if i had more btc than i ended up with I'd of done worse overall because i would have sold lower. And a slower rise would have killed my chances too.

You're just a hodler looking for reasons to keep hodling and offended that people talk about the real state of bitcoin which is both good and bad. You obviously bought on the rise. Many of us are already 10s of or even 100s of times out on their initial investment and still with significant hodlings. I don't believe in sugarcoating any of this for anyone. This is brutal, and over the years people have taken their own lives over bitcoin investments. So when it hit $20K and half of my social circle asked me how to on ramp to it, I told them straight. Don't. 
Do I believe in cryptocurrency as a usable ledger? Yes. Do I believe in Bitcoin (and Litecoin) as the preeminent coin with the most expertise behind its development? Yes. Do I believe cryptocurrency is a highly innovative and emergent sector full of incredibly intelligent people? Yes. Do I believe it can go higher? Yes. But I also recognise the capacity of people to suffer through the consequences of severe financial losses.

There's nothing to conclude either way. Sure he's been around, but with all due respect, an independent audit would absolutely clear up the situation, and one that is actually getting real media attention now. Everyone involved is extremely wealthy and usually fairly connected in certain circles, but it doesn't negate the possibility that there's some underlying economic flaw in tether. Even if everyone involved is absolutely working in the best interests of bitcoin, or the larger cryptocurrency marketplace. 
A few NDAs need to be signed by some high level auditors from a globally recognised audit company and a report should be produced stating various truths. This constant "oh look this really important bitcoin guy said this and therefore it's true" is a bane on the whole crypto world. I've watched it since 2012 and every time there's some greater power that convinces 10s of 1000s of people to do something a couple hundred million go missing, and some people magically disappear.
Of all the things that could bring the entire cryptocurrency space to a grinding halt it'd be one of three things:
* Collapse of Coinbase
* Collapse of Bitfinex and/or Tether (clearly not mutually exclusive though)
* Failure of Eth or Btc in any of their fundamentals
At this stage I'm going to assume as a matter of uninformed and uneducated opinion that Bitfinex run a fractional reserve at approx 10% holdings and they printed a 90% borrowing and proceeded to purchase bitcoin and other crypto asset with it. And I'll bet they weren't even aware of the run on effect this would have for the entire market, because outside of a few thousand very wealthy whales making large constant plays and giving the perception of outstanding volume the market is quite thin. Anyone who isn't in the least bit skeptical about what is going on is an absolutely idiot or completely new to crypto investment.

The moment the Rothschilds feel threatened is the moment we find out they purchased 20% of Bitcoin. And the only reason you wouldn't already know if they are vested or not is that by detailing their vestment it will also create a market stabilizer for the asset class. Perception is everything. 
For them it's arguably extremely easy as a family estate to purchase that level of coin even WAY above its current market cap.

Ok if you attempt to work out a maximization of people who have 21+ coins I'd do it like this.
Every address &gt; 100 coins is individually owned. (exchanges own the keys therefore exchanges own the coins -- because we've seen maybe $1B USD in misfortune so far in BTC at current prices)
So that's just under 19,000 address.
Then I'd maximize the possibility of holders with addresses smaller than 10 BTC. Dividing each subgroup by 21 we end up with a total of about 74,000 people.
Then for the last group, those addresses between 10BTC and 100BTC you can't just divide by coins because you'd end up with 210,000 people which is more than the number of addresses (130,000). So bell curving would be a good way to go about it. But for argument sake, let's say they all have 21 then that's 130,000.
We're at 225,000 with 75% distribution. From a maximum potential of 768,000. So roughly 33% with a 'my keys my coins' strategy. 
The remainder could net a further 232,000 people with 21. BUT let's assume distribution stays the same, then we'll only add 77,000 to 225,000. So that's 300K give or take.
Sure there could be more. But there's probably less.


I'd think similar too.

CORRECT. I love BTC. I'm also a small blocker at heart after some long soul searching on how big block changes reduce security of the base protocol. I also by comparison to many have sweet-f-all vested in BTC which is unfortunate but a reality.. 
But the sentiment of layers is also analogous to money and banking. Let's just assume money (the base layer) was a tangible quantifiable non-inflationary 'commodity', printed in limitation by the mint, and influenced by adjusting policy in an idealistic democratic society, monitored by the reserve and implemented through government policy. Then the banks are those second layer strategies that centralize and control through profit dependent entities who compete, through manipulation, subterfuge, monopolization, price fixing, and fanboi-ism.
We need to be very careful in the way higher level 'authorities' are inevitably forced to create products and services to cater to mainstream market expectations.
Perhaps BTC is 'only' the global replacement for USD in that the rest of the world, and probably most of the US has no allegiance to a US government controlled monetary system and thus serves as a mainstay for the reduction of government risk. Perhaps we end up with centralization at the higher layer and that's ok because your allegiance isn't as fixed to those entities. Perhaps the competition through reduction of overheads in a purely technological banking structure is so profound and fierce that it's difficult to screw over the consumer with high rates, lock-in contracts, slow transactions, etc. Perhaps the open source expectation for many layered protocols that sit on top of bitcoin core allow for sensible prudence and the reduction in lost capital brought about from deceit, fraud, and unethical behavior.
So what am I saying? I have no idea really. I think maybe it's safe being a small blocker, and I hope bitcoin core isn't overly limited that excessive risk is necessary and exposed on higher layers. But it's certainly all about compromise and uncertainty at this stage.

There's plenty of other investment opportunities out there. People can bang on about technical analysis as much as they want but for those of us who have been investing for the past decade or two, this isn't the first non-performing investment we've been involved in, nor the last. 
It either goes up, finds mass adoption, finds merchants, introduces new implementation goals such as segwit approval, lightning networks, higher efficiencies, less centralised mining, less divergence in the policies of the developers, or it fails.
As 'big' as bitcoin is, I can hardly talk to the potential investors I know about it without their eyes glazing over.

Everyone is an expert here. So I'd take the idea of 7%-11% with a grain of salt. The idea of stating no it's not 2%-3% but try 7%-11% is wildly ignorant. Especially considering two different economic situations are being discussed. The way I see it is assuming a reserve bank retains its autonomy and acts in cooperation with rather than beholden to the Treasury and affiliate banking bodies, CPI should be a reasonable benchmark when looked at over a long term period. 
For some details on interpretations and difficulties in defining CPI within the modern environment the following is worth a read:


The other thing is subjectivity is key in almost all individual circumstances. For instance anticipated quality of life and the change in utility across any purchasing metric will have varying results for every household. CPI is a single figure that's defined to assist in making adjustment for perceived monetary utility value for all citizens. So there will always be variation.


And yes in the Australian climate, netting 5% adjusted interest on investments well diversified or following one of several indexes should have been completely reasonably for quite some time. Which is about 5% better than cash in the bank. It's certainly real growth (until it's not), and not just inflation. But then again, what is it the kids say these days.... ymmv?
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:12:01
My comment is a little about your comment, and more about the chain and future in general.
I'm all for coexistence here. But sometimes the fees argument gets taken way too far. In a mainstream economic situation using BTC/LTC and other coins, the fees attached to LTC will be no better than 4 times that of BTC. And it will depend on the creation of smart software, lightning networks and other 2nd layer protocols to better both of their efficiencies at that point. It will also depend on the ability to flag bad actors in a blockchain through the community that are thoroughly inefficient solutions. And these bad actors will always exist, and always burden the upper limit of performance.
Just the other day there was a post that listed the inability to adjust fees within wallet applications (both web and desktop) and it highlighted the very important point that even the ability to adjust fees means that it's a race to the top as people compete for block space.
We're going to have to support the implementation of smart preemptive fee algorithms that can best determine the weighting of fees and help people to appropriately define/select the immediacy of their transactions.
If you ask me, BTC absolutely needs LTC at this stage even with LNs. At the moment it's just a bunch of techies who pass cash around to each other for mostly techie based products/services. They will eventually need to reduce their burden by supporting the offloading of transactions onto another stable, and well respected network such as LTC that has 4 times the throughput.
And for anyone thinking LN is unlimited. It's simply not. LN has to settle with the chain. And there will be limits to how long a channel and the participants will want that open without settlement before reentering a new channel. Remember it's a 2nd layer protocol with its own set of inherent risks.

While it may be 'fact', it's skewed to the positive through the psychology of numbers. What would be more sensible is to say:


A lot of people don't see that a 43% correction from the top is much more significant than a 556% rise from the bottom. Because an 82% 'correction' is equivalent to that 556% rise ... but very very different static numbers to the uninitiated.

The idea that crypto should take us back to the gun-slinging-wild-west is just futile and silly. We're past that. The legal apparatus around the globe is here to stay, as are banks, governments, and politicians.

Big news flash ---- tax is real and should be paid. Wanna go live in Kuwait.. be my guest. And conversely... losses can also be attributed to crypto investments. A capital loss has its uses in most countries too.
People.. please take your crypto outlook and cut say 20% to 30% off it if you want it as a means of reinvestment in other asset classes.

That's a fucking ponzi attitude. You just want people to hodl so you can make more money. As great as the tech is, the community is disgusting. I sold several hundred thousand dollars of bitcoin and really glad i did. The 1-million club is nothing now. I'd be very surprised if 5k wasn't a likely price. 
A friend of mine 'bought the dip' at 12k. They're not happy with that decision.

But there's a difference between buying $1,000 at 8k and buying $100,000 of btc at 8k. A lot of people who talk shit really aren't playing with much money. I realised over 100x my initial investment and at current prices I'm hodling 50x my initial investment through the drop. Even that's enough of a 'risk' even if it is 'free' money.
Some people playing with pennies, and some with pounds..

Do you though? I've never taken that philosophy. Cost averaging just raises your base price on any given asset. Unless you're SEVERELY underfunded in an investment then just see where your initial investment amount goes and play with the rest elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:13:17
But how much did that affect your base price? That is all that matters.

I was disappointed selling half of mine at 17k...sellers remorse is just that and you're going to be disappointed no matter what.. but you know selling when you did still makes you sane. We all know that 5k isn't out of the question. And even at 5k I won't be buying more.
I hodled since 2013 .. I stuck through the real shit and the failing exchanges, and all of the security issues. Knowing you've realised some gains is damn important and allows you to ignore most of the day to day. The reason I'm here now is because this drop, the USDT issue, the Indian issue, and the Korean issue are really interesting.

I hope the two of you are feeling better regardless, If not you should feel better that I just printed that little argument you had with each other, came all over it, screwed it up, threw it in the bin, and moved the fuck on. I probably felt better than both of you combined for almost 3 seconds.

I hear that. We reduced our loan from 28 years left to 6 years left with crypto alone. Hoping to see it gone in 4 years from today. You have to be pretty naive not to save several decades of debt and hundreds of thousands in interest payments.

This is unpopular opinion here. But I tend to agree. MtGox, Mintpal, Cryptorush.in, Moolah, Mintpal, Cryptsy, Bitconnect, Coincheck. And god knows about that other really large looming issue that no one can get an answer on. That list is by no means exhaustive of shady exchanges either.
Someone needs to convince me that the original ideology of bitcoin was as a means of displacing banks rather than being a disruptive technology to the payment gateways that have plagued us all by excessive fees, slow transaction times, and centralised control with general purpose of mobilising millions of small transactions across borders. 
There's no reason the banks and bitcoin can't work together, but every time I talk to someone heavily vested in bitcoin they always suggest that banks are the devil.

Yea that's fairly common. I see that far too often. It may be ignorant but my investment strategy is almost always, determine a base price I'm happy with and invest it. No more money going in. 
People aren't 'investing what they can afford to lose' they're 'investing what they can afford to forget about or ignore'. A lot of them are in denial about their own vesting strategy and what it has cost them. Many don't even know how much they've actually put in.

But instead of tying it to USD .. would you be happy to be paid a fixed BTC figure for the next 12 months? For example .. from now on you will be paid 0.4 BTC per month.

Basically if CSW signed anything to do with those coins the whole world of crypto would disappear because it'd then clearly be a scam/ponzi.

What are you talking about? There is risk in gold. 


Real estate equally has risk, often in the form of unforeseen costs. Even foreseeable costs on real estate are open to risk adjustments.
It concerns me that people discuss these things as if they're risk free simply because 'historically' they've been better linear performers with less volatility.

We're talking something like 260 sat/byte now for 'instant' (within 10 to 15 minute window) without taking a look at bitcoinfees. Which in regard to Electrum equates to 2.6mBTC/Kilobyte.
It's a fair size transaction fee. Considering average transaction size is what..33% of a Kilobyte or so. That's $1.50USD for a timely transaction. 
Obviously the multi-thousand BTC crowd can scoff at that and turn their nose up at the problem, but for average transactions it's at the level of Mastercard and Visa, and for small transactions it's abysmal and significantly worse than any other payment network for both time and cost.
I guess what we have is people who look at BTC as purely a store of wealth or settlement layer, and people who want to use BTC in their daily lives. This is as ideological a debate as Democrat vs Republican..

Precisely. The only counter to any of this was if there was an option for the anti-segwit crowd to reject all blocks flagged in support of segwit. The only way that could have worked is in it being enacted extremely early to force segwit support to never gain traction through lost realization of rewards.


And you're absolutely right on this. I guess the silver lining of all of this is that let's say for some crazy reason segwit turned all of earth to dust and brought about the end of days --- there's always a BIP number waiting for those with the fortitude and foresight to explain, educate, gain support, and correct the problem.
It does however raise the real concern of community hype and the effects of media on the ecosystem. In my eyes segwit is a better way forward, is it the holy grail? No, it's certainly a step towards something greater. But a corporate or political takeover in the future is a real concern considering the game that has been played and ultimately won by UASF. And there will always be people willing to play it when there's so much at stake.
