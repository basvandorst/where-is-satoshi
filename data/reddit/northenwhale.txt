Then you and those that would do the same are rare gems. Kudos
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:59:06
Does this relate to the environment or are you discussing something else?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:50:17
Great idea this would reduce the need to heat you're home using radiators etc
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:38:24
Would you elaborate please?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:43:19
So the solution would be greater and more efficient development of renewable energies rather than a change to crypto mining?
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:00:10
Slight derail from the initial question but feel free to argue amongst yourself and Thank you for your input
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:00:08
Would this reduce energy usage for confirmations?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:41:47
Ok poor choice of words then, my apologies. I'll try again.
Does bitcoin have anything coming that will reduce its electrical consumption?
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:24:06
Thanks for your insight and enjoy your rest
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:49:45
Certainly something would have to change at some point. I'm assuming China has co2 regulations and targets, but I'm not certain on that. Interesting that it might actually push forward the need for renewables to play a greater role in the global energy market. Cheers
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:40:00
Due to the competitive nature of bitcoin confirmation. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:36:23
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:35:43
How is it not wasteful?
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:12:27
Are you just explaining why energy usage is high? I don't wish to discuss bitcoin price please. Not trying to be rude.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:01:08
Cheers man I agree
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:22:02
If the aim is to reduce the energy usage for confirming transactions then this could possibly be a step backward rather than a step forwards then, correct?
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:33:55
The question i asked wasn't really intended to be hypothetical but cheers anyway fren
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:53:54
I personally agree it makes zero difference how much energy is used, so long as it doesn't affect the environment.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:57:54
Wow you think big
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:30:36
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:47:43
Wasteful = Poor choice of word.
I'm not blaming bitcoin for anything, I was merely asking a question regarding energy usage and if it is being addressed from a development level. Didn't mean to touch a nerve it wasn't my intention.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:57:42
Does anyone disagree with this?
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:11:46
I see your point
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:10:56
I don't think you get my point. Even though I understand yours.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:12:08
I see your point
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:15:27
I'm not mad at this simpsonistic comment but still looking for evidence of gold Price swings of 10% +/- in 24 hours. 
Let's all be grateful that Google is free and paid for by data gatherers and advertisers.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:10:18
Sorry I wasn't trying to denounce bitcoin. I was simply saying that the price of gold has never just dropped by 10% in a few hours only to bounce back. One of the fundamental qualities that makes gold a secure store of value is it's inability (or difficulty level) to be traded.

spectre.ai offers a 2% monthly dividend with huge potential. I'm hoping this gives me a small and steady monthly income somewhere down the line, having invested 2 eth in the ICO. here's some info on what they're trying to achieve.

When everyone is looking one way the opportunity is generally in the opposite direction
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:25:30
ha me too! thought I'd timed it well
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:03:40
I'm blinded by the Bitcoin...
Don't try and change my tune...
Cause I thought I heard a saxophone...
I'm drunk on my way to the moon...
And the moon's a golden bitcoin...
It's pouring champagne stars...
Broadway's like a serpent...
Pulling shiny top-down cars...
Laramer is teeming...
With that undulating beat...
And some Bonneville is screaming...
It's way wilder down the street...
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:58:59
I own bitcoins but I want the price to keep going down so I can buy more!
