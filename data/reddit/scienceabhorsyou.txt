Your fears are misplaced. Normal transactions are still irreversible. What this lets you do is tie up your own funds, and only your own funds, in a cold wallet such that you have an undo period. If someone steals your cash, you can revert your own cash during that period.

You seem worried about fungibility, but if you read their blog post (it's linked elsewhere on this page), you'll see that fungibility is not affected. Vaults are for one's own use. You create one, keep your coins safe in it, then take coins out to a hot wallet, and spend from there. There is no way someone can secretly attach an "undo" operation to a payment they made to you and recall their payment. That's not the goal of a vault at all.

Why does it matter whether he owns any cryptocurrency? Can you not address the substance of his comment? Why do you need to attack the man and try to label him a troll for pointing out a real concern with this community?

You should read the links posted elsewhere in this thread, but as far as I understand it, it works like this:
* Unvault requires a vault key.
* Hacker can indeed do the unvault just as easily as you if he steals your vault key.
* But if he does that, you can use a second recovery key to undo his unvault operation and restore your funds. You have 24 hours (or whatever you pick) to do this. You'd keep your recovery key somewhere that is far more secure than your vault key.
* What about a hacker who compromises both your vault key and recovery key? In that case, the hacker and you are indiscernible and the problem seems intractable, because no one can tell who is the real you. They let you convert the full amount into mining fees in this case. So at least the hacker doesn't get to profit.

That's not how it works. You put your coins in the vault, you take them out, wait for the unvaulting, and only when it's done can you pay someone.

You'd vault your long term savings with a vault transaction. This sends them to some address you create, say V. You take them out of there with an unvault transaction into your hot wallet H. And then you spend from your hot wallet H to a merchant, with a regular, irreversible transaction.

A merchant or lbtc trader should only accept regular transactions. Vaults are for personal use only. If someone tries to pay you with a vault transaction, it'd be obvious and your wallet would refuse it.

Where exactly is the work? It sounds like vaporware. This is precisely the "X ... but with Bitcoin!" approach that everyone makes fun of. 
Let me question the very premise: If this Reddit-but-with-Bitcoin existed outside Ryan X Charles' imagination, I wouldn't pay to upvote anything on it. It would attract spam and astroturf immediately and become unusable. It has no chance of succeeding. 
Only if you do not understand human interaction might you think that hypermonetizing every interaction is a good idea. Normal people don't want to make purchase decisions. They just want to get their word in, discuss, argue, make fun of each other, and so forth. A world where you pay for every micro action is a terrible one, and this guy is just someone who has never finished a single project (starting with grad school, to Reddit Notes or whatever, to Bitcoin in JS, and now this) in his whole life.

Excellent comment, the Qntra blogspam has gotten quite out of hand. And these alternative manifestations of the same flawed way of looking at the world aren't quite talking to each other. They're just saying shit *past* each other. 
Did you see the ranking scheme they made up? It's a reputation scheme or something, except it's really just mircea and his sock puppets trash talking other people.

ChangeTip does need to fund the platform provider to not have the platform provider boot them off. If they were actually successful, which they are not, and they ate into Reddit Gold profits, which they don't, can you predict what Reddit would do? Come on, it's easy if you try.


You can be careful all you like, many people have done the math and it doesn't add up.


Show us. And do not say "paywalls" because no one wants those. 
Do you want to make a bet that this idiot squad will not be able to get second-round financing?
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:32:54
And just how surprised are we about this? 
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:54:31
ChangeTip is not a platform. Reddit is a platform, ChangeTip piggybacks on that platform, but does not fund the platform provider. So it's diametrically opposed to the platform operator's economic incentives. It just isn't a viable idea in the long term.
