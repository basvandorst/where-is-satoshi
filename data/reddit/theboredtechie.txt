If you don't invoice the client you don't get paid. I once forgot to submit an invoice until I realised 8 months later, contacted the company to let them know and just sent my email then and got paid a week later!

Firstly I'm super pleased you decided to comment on my post after a 11 month hiatus! I appreciate your input! 
Like you, I'm also not an expert but we have tax brackets so get taxed depending how much you earn. 20% on all income up to £37500, 40% up to £150k etc, then you can deduct things and usually I just let me accountant sort things like thst out. Then you send off your tax return and they will let you know what you owe them and you you've paid to much tax they will reimburse you or if the HMRC thinks something's off they will investigate you(that's a really really watered down version of what goes on but what I go on) but yeah every job I get paid for I keep my tax money in a separate account and send it off when needed!

That's definitely a good start! Shame with getbittr.com that you have to do it manually! It would definitely be perfect if it was an automatical process! 
I shall have a look into bitwage!

Hey! I'm not sure if it differs per industry/country but over here every job I do I have to submit an invoice. Usually I get issued a purchase order from my clients with an agreed amount to receive for my work then once the job's complete I have to submit an invoice to get paid!

Thanks for your response! I was more looking to see if there was a way I could be paid my day rate in fiat (like they usually would) but rather than go into my fiat bank account it would go straight into my bitcoin wallet automatically without having to manually do it and as U/xtools-at it would help with the taxable side of things too!
