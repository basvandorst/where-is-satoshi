What. The blockchain is nothing more than a fancy ledger...
Made of software. How can you trust bitcoin software but not trust the blockchain?

Is GDAX more reliable? I haven't been able to figure out what to go by since I'm a bit of a nub at this. Only been hodling 1 month

Help the devs out by using their test network.
1) Follow the steps in 
2) Send tBTC to wherever using open channels
3) post your own public address so people can send tBTC to other addresses than

I don't know what you mean by a bitcoin certificate, sounds like a scam! If I were to hand you a piece of paper and written on it is 'this certificate is worth 2.5 Bitcoin' then that paper is worth fuck all.
Are you talking about futures? Then you're placing trust in a third-party, which is in some ways more risk than just buying bitcoin outright.
Instead of investing in someone else's promise of bitcoin 'certificates' why not buy bitcoin itself instead? That way you actually own what you invest in, plus your coins are backed by the consensus - a huge amount of computers all over the world that validate and recognize that yes, your address does own bitcoin. They can't do that with a certificate.
You know what they say: not your keys, not your house. If you don't own it they can lock you out.
Not your keys, not your bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a currency, you own the keys to your digital property, your coins.
Stocks are where you invest in a company, said company would ideally use your invested money to grow. And since you 'own' a part of the company because of your investment your stocks grow in value.
This is grossly oversimplified, but the biggest difference is that bitcoin is a currency and stocks are not.
Also, you can buy 0.003 of a bitcoin, you can't buy a half of a share of stocks.

50k sounds like a bubble, maybe it'll reach that at an ATH due to hype surrounding lightning adaptation? I believe the daily weighted average will be around 20k by the end of 2018.
But honestly, this prediction means just as little as the one who has a million invested in his prediction.

The fact that there even is news about it in the first place actually gets people to understand that bitcoin is a real thing you can have.
Which is a good part of the reason bitcoin's fiat value is rising now, demand is increasing due to coverage.

Being bitcoin-rich is also a realisation of said luck, it's all speculation so far. Therefore imo getting millions worth of bitcoin in it's current state is also hardly representative of hard work and effort being rewarded. But that's a whole new can of worms lol.
Glad we could exchange our viewpoints on this stuff.

 Intrinsically, nearly everything you own is inherited.

On a scale from 1-1000
Taking a potshot here
Putting you at 700, your neighbour 690
Sweatshop worker: 40
Random billionaire: 995
Scale that down and you and your neighbour aren't that far off each other. What is 10% **for your set of circumstances** is 1000% **for literally anyone else that's never going to be as lucky as you**
You need to be lucky that you are born in the same bracket to even begin to compare yourself to each other.
There are such vast differences in circumstances and chances it's absolutely disgusting.
Circumstances are everything, hence 'only 10% of your well-being is your work'

I'd like to see you say the same thing after winning the lottery.

And that career in engineering is made possible by technology that has already been invented, institutions that have already been made, languages that got taught to you, the family you've been born in, etc.
You are earning more than you did before, but that amount is still borrowed from circumstance.
If you weren't so lucky, you would be a starving sweatshop worker in Africa.
This is harsh reality, and it is very grounded.
You have to realize that you're not as self-made as you currently think?
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:23:01
I believe that about 10 percent of all your well-being is thanks to your own work. That's a generous number.
The rest is all due to the favourable conditions in which you live.

We'll see what happens when (or if) Bitcoin becomes further established. It's anyone's guess right now.
