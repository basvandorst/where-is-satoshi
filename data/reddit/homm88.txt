* Have horrible support
* Frequently fail to process withdrawals
* Frequently fail to process deposits

* Don't subject themselves to accounting and technology reviews.

Many inaccuracies.
1. SegWit isn't **needed** to fix malleability, it is simply one option of doing so.
2. Lightning doesn't require Segwit, it will work with any malleability fix. 
Also: only transactions that spend Segwit outputs are not vulnerable to malleability - so majority of BTC transactions currently are still malleable. 
I support SegWit, but claims in the article are exaggerated ~~and main purpose is to promote your wallet app~~. 
edit: Content marketing with honest intent is fair game. I was critical due to the mistakes I saw - but I can see now that the author has honest intents.

So you start by immediately trying to paint me in a negative tone, implying I just parrot someone elses stances.
Lets keep the discussion focused on Lightning.
I'll quote you the Lightning whitepaper. 


increases in the short term, if it achieves global scale, it will necessitate a
block size increase in the long term. 


blockchain spam designed to encourage transactions to timeout becomes
The closing of LN channels will not be as uncommon as you think, from users either preferring to keep their coins offline (cold storage, not hot), or channels timing out, or for other reasons.
Thus, the whitepaper literally says that eventually there will be an onchain bottleneck.
Is that fair to say?
(I know you'll not respond positively so I'll refrain from any further comments in thread.)
@_date: 2019-03-21 09:59:02

*"this cryptocurrency does not see malleability as a real issue and thus does not plan to deal with it in the near future"*
From what I can tell - many people in the community see malleability as an issue, and most understand that a fix will be needed if we want Lightning or a similar 2nd layer solution to be usable on BCH. (even with criticisms of it kept in mind)
Of course, decentralized governance is slow and development processes are slow (for all cryptos), so "near future" is very hard to define. 
An elegant proposal to solve malleability is Malfix: 
Most forms of 3rd party malleability have already been fixed in a previous BCH hard fork - and the final remaining one is hopefully going to be included in the next upgrade in Nov. (see: [BIP62  Mark Lundeberg on Twitter](

In a perfect world where Lightning solves all scalability issues, all timeouts, all routing and has sufficient liquidity for all transactions: 1.
In a realistic world it'll be more. Transactions may time out or be forced to be closed. There's also good reasons for closing channels and re-opening different ones.
I think many people greatly underestimate how many on-chain transactions Lightning will actually require.

Centralized exchanges offer higher liquidity, faster trade speeds, and potential for customer support.
Compared to DEX'es, centralized exchanges are actually able to provide a fiat onramp / offramp as well.
It'll take at least a decade until P2P marketplaces or DEX'es are able to come close to the price accuracy and liquidity they provide.

*"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."*
Coinbase is a peer like any other. They're not a built-in intermediary that Bitcoin depends on, they're simply one of many businesses that participates in its economic network.
Are all businesses that accept Bitcoin its enemies?
Is Overstock an enemy of Bitcoin, since Bitcoin is "supposed to be used only for person-to-person transactions"?
It's a voluntary choice to use a businesses services - so from that point of view, Coinbase is perfectly in line with Bitcoins values.

That's a good theory, but there's something very specific about the requirement of it being between 2008-2011.
Most tax avoiders would be fine with 2012-2016 wallets too, at the very least. 
To me, this signals that it's a clear attempt at a **reputational scam** - trying to prove that they were an "early adopter", an early part of the Bitcoin community. 
Since CSW's involvement with Bitcoin began at 2013 (and not any earlier), he has done many stunts to try "prove" his involvement in 2008-2011. It's highly likely that this is going to be another part of his stunts.
@_date: 2019-03-24 18:16:29


Not really - most websites already expect users to pay for the tx fees. (if you deposit, you pay the fee. if you withdraw, you pay a withdrawal fee which funds the tx cost)
It's rather a question of economic decentralization vs. full node decentralization. 
 - which of these countries can afford to pay $5, $10, $50 per transaction, and which can't? Could we enter a reality where only 1st world countries can afford to use Bitcoin? 
And in theory, if the amount of economic participants grows, that also creates incentives to run more full nodes and might actually improve decentralization. 
Neither side was "wrong", it's just a question of values.
I like that you called UASF malicious though - at least you're consistent. 
But again - signalling is a necessity in any decentralized decision making. Impossible without it, right?
@_date: 2019-03-24 17:11:58
Coinbase, and the other exchanges ("Bitfinex, Binance, Kraken..." as you said) **have the same business model.** 
OP said that it is "...business plan that is entirely obsolete once Bitcoin works as peer to peer money".
Coinbase hasn't distributed private information to "black market mercenaries", unless you mean the government. But then - all exchanges have some level of compliance with the governments.
Do note, I'm not here to defend Coinbase - my point is that centralized exchanges have their place in the ecosystem, at least until something better comes along.

There's a tradeoff between scalability, security and decentralization. You can get more of one, by sacrificing some of the other.
New innovations, technological improvements and 2nd layer solutions like Lightning can help augment the scaling, but eventually the onchain capacity will still be the bottleneck.

Banks can issue loans to essentially print money. Banks have a banking license. Banks have a business model that depends on keeping your funds with them as long as possible.
Coinbase doesn't get any additional benefit from holding your funds. You only need to have your money in "custody" for the length it takes to purchase. 
If you buy an item on Amazon, would you also complain that your money is in "custody" until you receive the item? 
I think you're simply being unfair due to your dislike of exchanges.

You've established that soft forks can be signalled for.
Can hard forks be signalled for? If yes, it's not an attack, surely?
If not, why not?


Metcalfe's law states that the value of a (telecommunications) network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2).
Thus, if Bitcoin has more users, (and we assume Metcalfe's law is a valid metric to value it), it becomes more valuable.
Lets take a hypothetical scenario, where the numbers don't represent anything but our values. 
If you had a genie, and could get 1 wish granted for you out of the following two options, which would you take?
1.) Bitcoin gets 10x more active users than it has now
2.) Bitcoin gets 10x more full nodes on the network 


I agree with layer-based scaling. LN is great. LN whitepaper says eventually in future blocksize will need to be increased. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 10:49:28
Will it?
If community is hostile to any discussions of a blocksize (hard) fork, why would it change in the future?
If discussion is censored on the biggest community platforms regarding fork suggestions, why would it change in future?
If a fork is risky because the Bitcoin network is so big, won't it get even risker if the network grows?
@_date: 2019-03-15 05:07:24
Scaling is a serious issue, and LN isn't enough of a solution for it.
@_date: 2019-03-25 08:33:25
No - the amount can be topped up in the ways you describe, but a channel creation is required to be onchain.
@_date: 2019-03-24 19:23:19
Alright - you agree that LN hubs are peers, and they are not banks. 
Seems like your definition is that custodianship == bank. 
Coinbase is primarily an exchange, and the business model doesn't revolve around custodianship.

1\. All exchanges promote multiple coins, not only Coinbase. It's rational to cover as much of the market as possible, to meet user demand.
2\. I consider S2X as a genuine, well-intended attempt at creating consensus for a change. Naturally, it was called off once it was clear that a consensus was unable to be reached.
How else are you meant to create consensus? Miners signal by hashrate, economic actors signal by publicly announcing their support, users signal by the software they run. 
If you think economic actors signalling together is a malicious act (wtf), would users signalling for "UASF" also be a malicious act?

I understand completely. Lightning requires on-chain transactions to open/close channels. 
Even in a possible future situation where routing is solved, and lets assume you close channels very rarely - there'll still be heavy demand on the 1st layer to create new Lightning channels to onboard new users.
But that's a best case scenario, and in reality, a healthy 2nd layer requires a healthy 1st layer. Lightning is a great means for scaling, but it doesn't "fully solve" scaling.

"Item selling site" isn't quite specific enough, it was more of an item trading exchange site, with sellers/buyers posting their own prices on each item.

The owner of dispenser.tf (Joto) has been very transparent and reasonable with resolving any issues with the site so far. I certainly trust that he's going to put in the effort to get the site running again, and make his best efforts to attempt compensating the users that have lost their funds.

If you have 51%+ of hashrate, that means you have a ton of mining hardware. If you have a ton of mining-specific hardware, you actually have the highest incentive to keep Bitcoin valuable and to not attack it.
If you do attack it, you may damage the value of the coin and do some damage, but your mining equipment will also become proportionally more worthless.
In case of a continuous malicous 51% attack, forking to a different PoW is the only viable option - no matter how costly it may be.

@_date: 2018-02-04 22:24:10
I've said so multiple times before, but  is actually very much a possibility. (and imo what happened, one way or another)  
The hacker definitely had access, and CSW definitely had access to info that gave him unfair advantage in pretending to be Satoshi. It would line up quite well.

Bitfinex isn't legit enough to be auditable, but they're legit enough to have full 100% reserves in their bank accounts.

True, though you basically pay a 3% fee in total (1.5% buy 1.5% sell) for that.

CSW is no stranger to scheming people. Risk/reward is obviously hugely in favour of him. His risk is not actually high at all since he could say he was just a part of the Satoshi team even if the original one shows up one day.
(or he might even say the keys were stolen?)
Obviously he goes out all the way, and real Satoshi would never call hin out directly.
It's all just game theory, you can easily assume CSW planned for each situation.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:54:10
Paid Satoshi? Never.
Got his keys or found out he's dead? Never.
Griggs, Matthews and others? Explained by CSW getting access to Satoshi emails. 
People like Gavin were also fooled by some (advanced) trickery, but just like all magic tricks that are known to mankind, it's still just deception. (I've posted about it before)
100%? I think we are at 100% - 99.9% chance Satoshi never calls anyone out, 0.1% chance he does, and CSW will claim Satoshis keys were hacked.
What I'm curious about: How many instances of CSW having unfair info do we have, and how many people have vouched for him? If we tally up all the different data points, we could make an indepth timeline of how CSW performed his scheme.

just buy some, buying is easy
coinbase (gdax), kraken, bitstamp main exchanges. 
each coin has their own valuation, i dont think they depend as much on bitcoin as they depend on the entire cryptocurrency market. if bear market comes, p much all coins fall.
ignore the noise and get btc first. if you're good with your btc and have had time to research others than you can step into others.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:18:12
deposit 11 euros more and make it a beautiful 60 eur
also a good reason to buy more bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:15:28
It won't happen? I disagree - **it has already happened.** 
ETH also handles up to 1m transactions a day so it's been proven more capable for day to day use than BTC.

Oh that chatlog is just golden. ^^
Thanks for your outstanding efforts Pine!

No, even if he gets called out he has a way to play it off. And thats less than 0.01% likely to begin with.
Satoshi is intentionally absent. He didnt comment on blocksize debate, much less why would he comment on CSW.
Satoshi being dead or lost keys sounds like bs - CSW probably doesnt know true Satoshi identity either, just the info available in emails.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:05:06
$3 now, with rumours that it'll be added to Coinbase. Buy, sell or hodl?

correlation doesn't mean causation
for a period of time, ETH was actually the one dictating the markets and bitcoin simply followed along upwards with it
eth and btc are equally large players now anyways so either of them can lead the markets
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:33:02
try buying dogecoin or ethernet instead
obviously kraken can't make any exceptions for you, so just play by what's allowed
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:11:34
buy in first, worry about the small details later
shorting cryptocurrencies - a market that can double overnight, and then fall back just as quickly is a terrible idea for newbies
fees are typically 0.25% and get lower for higher volume traders, so that's a non-issue for most

No they don't. All trades are between users.
This disclaimer means absolutely fucking nothing and it's probably only mentioned because of some legal requirement in Germany.
All the exchange functionality is (/should be) exactly same for both German and worldwide users.

You don't need a Kraken account, you just need to use their ticket request system.
Use the following: 
Pretty easy.

They said that 2 years ago too, it's clear that this "eventually" means nothing, and nothing will be ever done due to their negligence.

ye, just keep in mind that it's % based play
if $100 is a lot of money to you, +20% to turn it into $120 is pretty good, -20% turns it into $80'ish which kinda sucks
if $1000 is a lot of money to you, +20% to turn it into $1200 is pretty good, -20% turns it into $800'ish which kinda sucks
if $100000 is a lot of money to you, +20% to turn it into $120000 is pretty good, -20% turns it into $80000'ish which kinda sucks

We've had transaction backlog issues ever since 2015, it's not getting better, until Lightning really kicks in.
Want to know why the "horrendous" transaction fees dropped so much? Because people who actually used Bitcoin as a currency started using it less and less, due to the high fees and delays. Is this a good thing?
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:04:15
na, you're wrong.
have a nice day.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:56:24
Does it?
There's not been any reason for Satoshi to show up again - he helped get the ball rolling in early days, and any intervention by him isn't needed now, ever again.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:12:42
The trades have exactly same prices. **Kraken does not provide any liquidity of their own.** 
It's simply a legal mumbo jumbo thing that for German users, Kraken is always officially the counterparty, and they make $0 additional profit from doing so.
so tbh, this entire thread is pointless

yes/no. bitcoin is very very resilient to change. 
this is a feature, as well as a flaw. 
if there ever comes a currency that's better than bitcoin by significant enough of a margin, "change and adapt" may not be enough

It's probably a full Java based Remote Administration Tool (RAT) which gives the attacker full access to your computer including screenview, remote commands and file access, and keylogging logs.
I'd just advise on formating, especially as typically the usual antiviruses aren't good at identifying Java based malware.

It's because Bitcoin is cold hard irreversible cash, while Paypal Mycash funds have to be laundered and resold and they lose a large % of it (possibly even 30-60%) trying to convert it into bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:32:24

To minimize, since people would withdraw their BTC from the exchange?

I like your logic. Doesn't seem out of the question at all, if any of those exchanges were to operate fractionally.

I'm pretty sure they've had this mentor program for a long time.
I remember some people approaching me in 2014 and trying to convince me that there's a money making opportunity and that some gambling activities in the game are actually skill-based and can potentially be profitable... 
... except if it were so then they probably wouldn't have contacted a random person like me about it. So it was pretty certain they were just after the mentor rewards.
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:15:11
Yeah, but lets say they buy it in a store, then they deliver it to a place where they conduct the cryptography things.
During this delivery, it's possible to switch out the legit computer for a tampered one of exactly the same model. (one that would be prepared ready beforehand )
Obviously the victim isn't going to have his eye on the computer at all times, so a switch can be really fast and go unnoticed.
(Less likely possibility: pay off the store employees and work with them to prepare a rigged computer waiting for you)

Kraken will minimize trading downtime and allow for BCH trading. BFX prolly too. Deposit pre-fork, and just dump when your acct is credited BCH and trading pair opened.

@_date: 2017-07-02 22:45:46
Correct - that's one option I considered.
The other one would be tampering with the computer itself - install some sort of backdoor or DNS hijack, and then box it back up and pretend it's brand new. (perhaps even 2 identical of these and switch the real one for a tampered one somewhere along the way)
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:29:46
I assume the computer or network was still somehow tampered with (probably to deliver a tampered client) - but subtly, like a well prepared magic trick, so it goes noticed to the victims eye.

**Because no one is using it yet.** 
ETH absolutely does have a scaling problem until it reaches Serenity phase where they'll release PoS, sharding for scaling, and much more.

This match is a showmatch of only 2 players in the tournament:
Naniwa: Swedish player known as the best European player. Plays the race of Protoss and is known for his amazing unit control.
vs  
Scarlett: Canadian player known as the best NA player. Plays the race of Zerg and is known for being insanely good at the economical/strategical part of the game.  
(always reads the opponent and knows when to play greedy)
 most tournaments that have high prizepools only accept players that are known progamers or are otherwise proven/known to be skilled enough. You can participate in lower league tournaments for fun, just keep in mind to play for fun - not for the money. : )
