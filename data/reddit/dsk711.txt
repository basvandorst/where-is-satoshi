Mr.Robert is a super good show. Definately slept on.

Between 5am to now PST we have the reverse shark graph
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:52:00
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:30:33
Thank you, just realized I need to upgrade to premium to get that feature
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:07:18
Mercatox or kucoin
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:50:57
Tell me about cointrackin API key exports what does that do
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:00:08
That 40$ is pretty cheap when you have &gt;1k in coins. Id rather lose 40 than get scraped for all my coins. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:45:26
Satoshi is the NSA.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:58:18
I wish I took a picture but look like a flipped shark fin in the water then the price held steady which made a shark body shape.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:40:33
On kucoin I went into the junk folder on mobile phone or all messages and found it.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:46:50
Those sell wall they put up if 30 or so coins is annoying as hell. People just need to let the horses run.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:55:22
I found this oddly satisfying thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:40:51
Did you sell your lambo?
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:00:16
For people looking for an exchnage use mercatox or kucoin both work well.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:53:22
Like whalepool
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:37:34
Create an account on cointracking.info export your CSV data from exchanges then click on tax report and it will calculate everything out for you. This is the easiest process I have found.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:16:40
Keep up the good work! It looks fantastic
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:05:32
Dam 1000 Satoshi is like what 16 cents lol. I know the schemers......
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:27:20
We need to start a Jihad coin. Then turn it into a boon in the middle east.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:08:33
I just started watching that show its too damn good
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:17:07
I like the flipping big bird not seen very often but is a rare treat when you do.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:51:03
Seems fishy imo
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:57:59
Kucoin or mercatox
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:50:58
You check on Amazon?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:31:20
Yeah the third party spooked me when I bought mine back in december. The cellophane was kinda sketch but I just did a rest on it when I started.I know this doesn't help but I want you to have your coins secure and not another Mt.Gox. Here's the amazon link: 
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:56:51
Robot stupid phone correct
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:25:05

@_date: 2018-01-05 14:25:00
Can we get a translation to English please
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:57:43
Yes about 3/4 fire breathing 
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:10:19
Everything is proceeding as it was foreseen.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:44:19
Yeah today's going to be a ride for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:09:43
There is massive action going on charts a rodeo
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:05:41
Its been there for 3 days 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:41:54
At least 3 to 4 pots. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:23:10
I don't have either but I know they are the best. YouTube is probably your most helpful source for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:50:02
I invested like 100 bucks a week and doing fine for last month.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:29:27
Is this the onion?
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:25:20
Stay thirsty my friend. The gains will keep coming just HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:23:07
Sissys fear the dip, I embrace the dip that's when I buy those tasty coins.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:13:47
Definately but a bitcoin is worth for than a blue phat. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:55:49
I had a friend buy some stuff on the road back in November 2013. Lets just say I was in college and the quality was fantastic.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:10:10
Honestly not sure I basically used my login for Chase and then it linked.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:46:45
That might be super lucrative for alot of escorts. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:28:19
Yeah its gettin walled at 11096
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:59:18
Turn this up!!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:13:24

@_date: 2017-12-29 00:11:51
Bigchoys goverments.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:35:43
You might he interested in Casascius coins. They definately are worth buying.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:27:18
I think it's an institution or a whale trader that wants to get out early due to uncertainty.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:36:59
Fake news, CNN probably will tell us to buy bcash soon.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:23:02
Day traders covering margins, they view as safer when the roller coaster is heading  straight up
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:41:16
We approaching space right now 
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:37:38

@_date: 2017-12-19 04:07:16
Please PM u/devbitcoin with the problem he will take care of it for you. Remember to leave a tip.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:14:42
He was confused when lipstick containers arrived. Wasn't until the hammer was used that everything made sense. By far the best stuff you could get, never had anything better since.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:35:20
Its good. Thank you for telling me about the federal program. 15% is pretty good.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:51:06
Some one is buying at massive number at 11494 like 200 but keeps refilling watch the top buyer on GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:38:43
Yeah bit flyer is about 10x the size of Coinbase/GDAX by volume.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:55:32
That's nuts
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:39:21
Sell low, buy high.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:02:19
Yeah but as that market crashes it gave people the opportunity to buy low when houses were foreclosing to double on the sell.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:07:48
So a pyramid within a pyramid, I can get behind this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:01:48
Same I really want to be a shill for them because it's that good. Can't be more pleased with my purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:41:27
Well I will back my dollar with my gun if I have to.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:44:22
They are separate but easily transferable.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:25:37
Must be a bot because if they were live trading they would let the tide roll
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:15:36
Amazon has them. I bought cheap.ones for like 10 buck 1 gold 1 silver. You can get ones with all different designs. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:08:13
More like senseis
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:30:55
Never invest more than you would feel comfortable losing on a weekend trip.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:21:40
Woops meant 11.7 on mobile
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:04:47
Don't be a moron GDAX is owned by Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:01:41
Closing in on 11.7 right now 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:22:31
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:36:52

Bitcoin backed by the best computer network on the planet
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:45:02
My Dad bought CBOE stock from Morgan Stanley today. Other companies would be Merill Lynch or Citgroup.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:58:40
Buy the dip
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:48:36
Their will always be tax havens for bitcoins just like any currency. Not sure what the cryptolaws are like in Switzerland 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:09:29

Gonna take alot of time to chip that wall
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:32:43
I initially bought on Coinbase and got raked for 11200 when it was actually at 10400. Buy on GDAX and transfer to a Trezor or Ledger Nano s
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:47:20
I had u/devbitcoin recover mine for me. Took him like 10 min nice guy also super professional.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:23:36
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:03:45
Someone is pumping more money in just like when it started to at 11.1 this will get us up over 11.8
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:00:09
If you believe it could have been tampered with do a hard reset on it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:48:18
Someone is juicing the price right now
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:33:46
Go on Amazon right now pay your 70 bucks and get a Ledger Nano S it can hold most cypto coins. Best investment if you care about security and privacy. PM me if you need help.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:30:25
Trezor or Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:08:27
Fasten your seatbelts is all I gotta say
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:25:44
Please use GDAX, same login as Coinbase but you will get better prices when buying.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:05:51
Id buy the charts are nuts
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:09:10
12379 there's the dip
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:56:37
Get a Nano Leger S on amazon they are cheap and when you do message me so I can give you a federal code. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:03:55
11.6K on GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:17:18
Best Customer service sorry about your experience, wish you the best.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:10:23
Some got scared there is no adjustment 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:33:41
Houston we have liftoff almost at 11.4
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:46:00
Just perfect laughing so hard right now.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:24:00
Definately a hardware wallet. Ledger nano S makes for an awesome storage device. PM me and I can send you a link.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:19:39
Do you see those huge buys someone wants it to hit 20k
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:07:29
I saw that earlier. I was thinking its to juice the momentum to overcome walls. If a human sees all these buys popping up they are more likely to buy regardless of what the price is doing on average. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:13
Bought Dip save chip
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:12:34
The cookie gods have spoken
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:26:58
Yeah but id buy from GDAX which is owned by Coinbase. Link you bank or card to Coinbase then link your Coinbase to GDAX by logging in. On GDAX you can determine what price you want yo buy or sell at. Hopefully this helps you.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:56:38
The bubbles are coming out of the champange after today's gains.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:08:07
People have huge sells on 11.9 like 140 bitcoins worth but idk its been crazy for last 3 hours
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:29:37
That's why you transfer from bank to Coinbase to GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:18:58
Will trade tulips for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:57:26
Its nuts because it looks like 2 main buyers and sellers playing with serious dollars
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:55:47
Go big and bet your house.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:03:04
11.6K brother
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:36:44
