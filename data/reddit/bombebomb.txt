Stop it! I don't know when the joke stops and when the serious question starts. lol

Well played, not sure if anyone else caught it.

You could say it would be, off the charts.
What would probably happen is price would rocket but only until his bought his billion of bitcoin...unless you could force to only pay max price lol. If using an exchange of course.

In order for a single bitcoin to be worth a billion by EOD tomorrow someone would have to be willing to buy a single bitcoin for a billion.

Your credit score, just went up quicker than bitcoin.
Now go get another loan so you can keep a rotating loan on your credit lol.

Five minutes in....turned it off, the music, and everything else was just... ugh. I found it more annoying than reading this reply because of the dot dot dots.

Is this some sort of meth joke? There's one in there somewhere I just can't pinpoint it.

Bitcoin hits 20k, quit using numbers not in the millions I think.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:47:52
Wait, I didn't advise he buy more bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:41:31
Holy sheet.

An auto refresh would be better.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:05:29
Throwing random numbers here (aka I know nothing).
If BTC hits 200k ea, and loses 90% of it's value in a "Crash" It would only be worth 20k ea, totally not worth hanging onto lol
I know there is a million other ways to make money, some may be better, I don't know.

It may be in your best interest to make a bot that posts this automatically, or quit your job and do this full time. At the current rate of growth it'll be 10 times a day with in a month.

In this(or that) market the chances of being up are pretty darn high. Big time Bull market the last couple months.
TLDR: I don't know how to trade, but I know the terms bull market.

Take your upvote, I fully expect to see this exact same post, in a thread in 24 hours, with this post added to the list.

To make it even more exciting, they can throw in the words Sell, Gpu, mining rig. I know when all 21 million are mined our GPU's will be useless.

Just remember, way back in 2013 or whenever, someone bought at the top. They're now up 400 percent.
They're also people who bought a lot off things at the top, and lost their money.

Tldr: this guy mentions Tai Lopez in this post. That's all anyone needs to know.

Dropping prices make for weak hands, I wish you luck hodling strong.

Real men of genius.

Ironically (and I truly mean ironically) on the 1 hour chart I had this timed pretty good for the spike that just hit. So I guessed when a green line would go up, probably my only guess this year that will work.

The world may never know! lol

Which one of these coins can I mine with a radeon x700 Pro? Will it be worth it? I live in the cheapest country there is for power.
