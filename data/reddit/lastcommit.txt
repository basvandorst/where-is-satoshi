Thanks for the interest. Here's the source: 
Thanks for pointing me to the bitcoinaverage site. I went with CoinBase exclusively in this case because it's the easiest US-based exchange to buy and sell from. I want to know the price of BTC in real live USD minute by minute on a real live exchange.
If you add to it or see room for more improvements, send me a pull request.

It sounds like you have a few too many extensions to show them all. If you hover over the right edge of the location bar, you can resize it by dragging it to the left. That should reveal your collapses extension badges.

Simplicity is goal  If I hear more demand from FF users, I may look into porting it.

Chrome extensions need explicit permission to access any website outside of itself. In this case, I'm calling  in order to retrieve the price info. Chrome's default warning reports "access your data on *". In the interest of security, it is an overly broad permissions message.

I have over a decade of experience building web apps, and Chrome extensions are built using basic web technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
If you have any experience in that realm, you can jump into Chrome extensions by reading through their documentation and taking apart some examples: 
Otherwise, you should get the basics of the web under your belt by building out some simple web pages or following some step by step tutorials at places like

I'd love to hear what r/bitcoin thinks. If you think it's useful I'd love to hear it. Consider this a first version, so if there are any suggestions or features you would love to see, let me know.

The extension doesn't touch any logged in user data or data on any webpage. It only pulls data from the CoinBase api itself. It's a standalone.

If you continue to have connection issues send me your console logs:
* right click on the extension badge
* select "Inspect Popup"
* select the "Console" tab in the Developer Tools pane
* refresh with Apple-R or Ctrl-R
* copy the console logs (especially any red errors)
* message them to me
Thanks for trying it out!
