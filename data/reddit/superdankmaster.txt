What's crazy is that the thread back then looks like this subreddit now. Just with different numbers. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:07:11
About to order one right now. I've been looking for an excuse to get one of these haha. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:51:43
This is hilarious.

Truer words were never spoken.

The problem is apple isn't going to make an open source anything. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:25:51
No problem dude. It looks nice so far. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:27:48
I personally lost .01 btc to this. I felt like a moron as soon as I sent it. You live and learn.  
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:29:31

@_date: 2013-11-03 07:45:35

TIL that Google has a dead man's switch that seems to be very useful. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:12:16
Yeah its not a big deal, shit happens. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:23:25
Will do. I really hope someone has some spare bitcoin/wants a truck and/or boat haha
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:16:32
Haha I was busy listing my truck!

I'm going to keep working on them. My dad is a lot more receptive than my mom because of his entrepreneurial tendencies. So hopefully I can win them both over to the bit side with some presentation of the facts. I may create a slide show or something to show it to them, and perhaps other uninformed people. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:03:22
This was hilarious. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:43:06

Or B&amp;W hair styles 
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:45:41
I really have no idea what that is, but I sure will read about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:26:19
Then they'll accept Bitcoin. That doesn't mean they'll make their own currency. Apple is a large company, but they're not as large as they need to be to successfully implement such a thing. I for one wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot decentralized cryptopole. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:56:53
Done. Just waiting on my Bitcoin :) I don't use my computer much, but I'll be sure to give this browser a chance.
