I've used GoCelery quite a few times, and anytime I've had trouble, I get pretty quick support, which is usually a phone call that they initiate. That's too bad you're having trouble, but if you want your "review" of their services to be taken seriously, how about using something other than a fake 0 day account.

how exactly do you tax bitcoin?

I believe there are a few businesses that have experimented with BTC including a bar, barbershop, and some software companies. Nothing significant. Hopefully, if this little machine is successful, there may be more interest. I've posted about this on and so hopefully that generates a little bit of interest.
I only just bought my first bitcoin last week and another today, so I'm still fairly new to noticing these things.

Exactly. Bits are more than welcomed to those already on the bitcoin bandwagon, but to seem like a serious money to the rest of the internet, dollars make a grander statement. We just have to help those dollar tips become more visible which anyone can do with upvotes.

I used gocelery.com to purchase the bitcoin and just used their service to transfer the funds into my wallet. So what you're saying is they're not paying any fees to make my transaction going smoother?
@_date: 2014-10-21 14:28:46
I know and acknowledge all of the benefits of bitcoin. I'm just saying that I and most others would not be early adopters of the technology. If there was only ever a chance of getting a 1:1 ratio of your money back with the same risk of bitcoin not taking off and losing all of your money, it would not be a smart investment at all. I would still admire the tech and would probably play around with it, but I would not be a serious advocate or adopter until it was a proven, sound, and widely adopted currency.
But like I said, that is not the case, and there is huge incentive for us to help see bitcoin through for the good of the world, but don't lie and say you're not thinking of yourself first. We all are, and there is nothing wrong with that.  We're taking the risk because we believe in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:56:31
Just what we need. Help large tippers be seen and in turn get more people curious on what bitcoin is. In a way, large tippers are just the seed and the upvoters and commenters are the water and fertilizer that helps the seed grow.
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:51:15
I wouldn't just be watching the price but if the general mood about Bitcoin had shifted and it seemed there was a clear new front runner other than Bitcoin then I would jump ship. But it would have to take more than just the price dropping 50%.
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:29:23
I just wanted to announce that I finally bought into bitcoins!
A little back story:
I first started following bitcoins back in October of 2012, and then decided in November that I would invest $1000, and then follow up with 10% of my paychecks to start a sort of savings account with bitcoins. Well, when I was initially going to buy in, there was a small banking error where I guess I entered one of my bank account or routing numbers in wrong, and then just saw it as a sign that I shouldn't go through with it, so I eventually forgot about the idea for a while. Fast forward a year, I almost cried at how much the value had skyrocketed. 
Just the other day I happened upon the grand opening of Circle.com, and decided to give it a try, and the next day, got my confirmation numbers. I couldn't believe how simple it had become to buy into bitcoins now and with no extra fees! After much extra research on how the community has grown since 2012, I decided to start up my old plan of investing part of my saving into bitcoins. I'm a firm believer that cryptocurrency is the future and will stand strong with it as best I can. I'm already planning on building a computer within the next year, purchasing all my parts using bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:20:35
And an amazing tie! That thing was crazy, haha.
@_date: 2014-12-02 17:55:57
He doesn't see Bitcoin the way I do, and honestly if I didn't know as much about Bitcoin as I do now, I would agree with him 100% so I wouldn't call him a troll, just a skeptic. 
We should all be conservative with who we label trolls and stay open minded ourselves. Instead of calling them out like so, explain your own position, and ask questions as to why they believe what they do.
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:46:16
There's the main reason, you're supporting a movement that will help shape the world for the better, and at the same time, investing in your future. That's what savings are for right? Investing in your future.

Here's my second submission:

I don't like that I need to put in a lot of personal information when donating with Bitcoin. If they could just give me an address, it would be much easier.
Actually, does anyone here have their public address?
@_date: 2014-12-02 17:19:18
I don't see it as a speculative asset. It's just as real as any money I currently have, but to each his own I suppose.
I feel I can afford to be risky with my savings. If I were to cash out my bitcoin right now, I'd have made $150 so I'm not too worried. I won't though unless I have a dire reason to do so. I want to have this bitcoin until I can spend it on everyday life transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:15:49
@_date: 2014-12-02 17:48:34
Well you're looking at the price after quite the large bubble pop. I feel it's to be expected for the price to drop as much as it did after that. 
But when I first decided to invest into Bitcoin, I didn't just look at the price. I looked at all the progress that the world wide Bitcoin community has made in the last two years, and that alone says much more than its speculative price could ever say. After that, I started researching all of the different problems that could actually be solved with Bitcoin which AA has helped with tremendously. Now I'm on the path to learning how to code Bitcoin itself with the eventual goal of developing my own applications with the technology.
At this point, Bitcoin is much more than just a speculative asset. This is a technology that I can have direct influence on, and I find solace in the fact that there are many people much smarter than myself all around the world doing the exact same thing.

Glad to hear there are more like myself. I completely agree with you. Bitcoin is much easier to save than fiat right now I and in the case of an emergency, it's still ready available money. Like you, if I hadn't put this money into Bitcoin, I too would have just spent in on unnecessary things. Now, I'm actually saving money, learning how to budget better, and helping support the next greatest technology to disrupt the world since the internet. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 22:32:39
I know, I just wanted to get as many of these sub $400 bitcoins as possible. I guess I did BUT I WANTED MORE! Honestly didn't expect the price to bounce up this quick.

I'm sad too. I just got into bitcoin, and was hoping the price would stay cheap while I acquire them with every paycheck I get. Didn't last very long :(

I'm assuming you are the owner of the device? Any chance on getting the restaurant to accept bitcoin as payment?
We definitely need more people like you investing in these machines to bring bitcoin to more people in Reno, so thank you for your hard work and dedication! Whenever I can be able to test out your machine for a few weeks and see how it does, I may be interested in deploying some in the future as well. I've still got a few ties at the University which I feel would be a great place to advertise bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:09:15
It was down when I took the picture a couple of days ago, but I will be back to check it out again this Friday. From what I could tell, it accepts cash through the front. The pizza on the other hand is amazing. The restaurant does not yet accept BTC as payment, but I will actively be asking every time I eat there now.
*I should add that the restaurant itself did not set this up. I believe the cashier I talked to said it was a project from an owner's son.

When you have a world wide effort improving and growing a technology, it stops being a speculative asset, and starts becoming a disruptive technology. Price may have gone up and down, but development has increased exponentially, and with that will eventually come the increase in demand for Bitcoin.
I'm much more optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, so I calculate much lower risk than I'm sure you do. Also, the amount of money that I can currently spend right now if I so wish, is much more than I have previously had. Worst case scenario, I'm back to where I started with no savings but a better habit of budgeting my money, best case though is that I invested my money into a comfortable future. In my case, the odds are in my favor.
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:51:25
Haha, we're all very open with our eccentric emotions. 
I feel people just give a couple hundred bits in this sub particularly, as a supplement for gilding an exceptional post which I feel is respectable. I do see more outside tipping amounts getting larger though, so people are definitely catching on, and learning how to properly get others curious in Bitcoin.
Just don't forget to tip your actual friends and family so that you can get excited about the future outside of the internet and away from the hivemind.

Can anyone explain why my transaction took over two hours for confirmation?
@_date: 2014-10-09 13:53:14
I'm trying to understand how bitcoin can be anonymous and transparent at the same time. Andreas A. explained that law enforcement already had sufficent success in capturing criminals using present day techniques and technologies. So say an illegal activity were to occur with bitcoin, how exactly could law enforcement follow the blockchain to make an eventual arrest if the end users are anonymous?
@_date: 2014-10-13 19:55:06
I think he meant consistent growth?
@_date: 2014-10-09 14:36:52
So if you enter the blockchain anonymously and then do some sort of business with an end user that isn't anonymous, that's where the risk lies? 
So theoretically, governments could regulate bitcoin to make business end users sign up with an identity on the block chain so that potential illegal users can be identified. Couldn't this also be used to begin building profiles of all transactions on the block chain to eventually identify everyone who isn't very careful on how they acquire and spend bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-10-09 08:56:18
Or follow good advise when dealing with the police, and don't answer any questions. Practice your 5th amendment right to not say anything. That experience alone is worth more than 1 BTC.

@_date: 2014-10-21 13:12:23
I'm going to take the opposition with you. Honestly, if there wasn't the huge incentive of making a lot of money being an early adopter, I'd probably be one of the many that would wait until it's a viable technology before jumping in. But that isn't the case, there is a risk but a large incentive to see bitcoin through.
95% of bitcoin users that say this isn't true has to be lying unless they're an unbanked citizen in some third world country, where bitcoin actually has a sort of viable use at the moment, but still isn't great due to it's volatility.

@_date: 2015-05-20 19:49:38
You've got the right mind set in that you acknowledge that you're willing to lose it. The biggest obstacle right now that could crash bitcoin is scalability which developers still do not have consensus on. The more mainstream bitcoin becomes, the bigger a problem this is, and that's maybe a year away.
@_date: 2012-11-29 18:43:37
Well if a currency has the very real potential of increasing a relatively easy to commit crime, I'd say it's everyone's problem. I'm still not convinced that Bitcoins will be a viable monetary system due to how much easier it would become to commit crimes and I know many people who would take advantage of this security flaw.
Just think of all of the crimes that were busted due to detectives following some sort of money trail. Corruption, bribery, money laundering, ponzi schemes, and so much more. If Bitcoins became a national currency, we'd all be living in a much more dangerous world where we have made it easier for criminals to commit their crimes and get away with it. And might I emphasize that they would **get away with it.**
I'm not arguing saying that Bitcoins is a horrible medium of exchange, I'm just saying that there are flaws and as of now, I could never see Bitcoins becoming any major form of currency.
@_date: 2012-10-08 21:19:10
I have to agree, this was quite amusing.
@_date: 2012-11-29 20:34:02
Yes, your explanation of how this is being used to stop bitcoin criminals is astounding. Thanks for answering my question. /s
To be clear, if this is how you're trying to influence others in adopting your method of currency, then good luck with convincing others. I was genuinely curious of this matter and would have loved to see Bitcoin become popular but instead I get downvoted and treated like I'm asking retarded questions.

I've just seen it posted around so you can do [a simple search]( to see everything posted about it. 
That's really not the reason I started using Bitcoin. I was just trying to be funny. I started using Bitcoin because I realize the potential it has for bringing billions of people around the world basic banking services that they could not previously afford or even access. Even here in the United States, there are still Millions of un-banked people as my family growing up was one of them for simply not having a steady flow of income to afford the fees and what not, so we just stopped using banks all together which made simple everyday tasks in a first world economy so much more difficult.
