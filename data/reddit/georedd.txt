i dont think so. but im no tax advisor.
but I think you declare capital gains  even if you make NO income in that year.
for example if you made 100,000 on the sale of gold you sold in 2013 that you bought 3 yrs ago but you made no income and were unemployed all of 2013 you would still have to declare the !00,000 in capital gains.
however also remember that if things are commodities and capital gains that if you reinvest in the same type of product or thing with that money right away you usually are not considere to have "sold the asset" and wouldnt have to recognize the capital gain.
so I THINK if you bought bitcoin back in 2000 and traded it for dogecoin in 2013 that - even though you technically had something (bitcoin) that was worth more at the time of the trade , because you put it right into another commidity asset of the same type you wouldn't have to declare that you made a profit - because until you sell out of all your coins and go to cash or another compositely different asset type I don't think they consider you actually KNOW whether you really made a profit yet.
That's a guess though. my memory could be wrong and i'm not a tax expert.
probably best to google "when to recognize a capital gain in like kind exchange"
but this is why it is really important that bitocins etc be treate dlike they ARE - a commodity - NOT A CURRENCY&gt;
Because I think when you trade currencies you have to pay a tax every single time you trade.
And it's a full income tax not a capital gains tax at reduced rates.
Again I am pretty sure that is what I read but I am not a tax guy.
ok I just googled it myself:
"Like-kind exchanges.   A like-kind exchange is the exchange of property for the same kind of property. It is the most common type of nontaxable exchange. To be a like-kind exchange, the property traded and the property received must be both of the following.
    Business or investment property.
    Like property.
  Report the exchange of like-kind property on Form 8824, Like-Kind Exchanges. For more information about like-kind exchanges, see chapter 1 in Publication 544. "
other results
if bitcoin is considered a CURRENCY not a commodity or "property"
compare that to "currency trading " on non regulated markets
The principal intention of IRC � 988 is taxation on foreign currency transactions in a taxpayer's normal course of transacting global business.
For example, if a manufacturer purchases materials in a foreign country in a foreign currency, then the fluctuation in exchange rates gain or loss should be accounting for pursuant to IRC � 988.
IRC � 988 provides that these fluctuations in exchange rate gains and losses should be treated as ordinary income or loss and reported as interest income or interest expense. IRC � 988 considers exchange rate risk in the normal course of business to be like interest.

Well i wasnt going to say it on the bitcoin subreddit but i beleive this is exactly the reason bitcoin is becoming diluted with altcoins.
I have some altcoins but frankly it would be better if bitcoin adapted.
Having bifcoin continue with an archaic proof of work scheme which also concentrates mining and hence client power just introduces real long term uncertainity into the long term value of bitcoins as wealth storage.
I would feel much more comfortable if i saw that bitcoin quickly adopted any improvements in the  bitworld .
Now we have to hedge with dogecoin.
Itz annoying and hurts the value of bitcoin and its adoption if people start to realize that bitcoin is not a certainty.

however whether or not to file a suspicious activity report is open to querstion becuase there isnt a mandatory minimum for bitcoin or wasnt then. (and it is "suspicious" not known illegal activity )
helping a customer circumvent AML restircitons could just be considered cutting red tape - examining their activity and then deciding it wasnt suspicious just large.
Unless they have him KNOWING that is was being used for drugs in an honest law system he shouldnt be charged. of course we have a law system of those who they want prosecuted and those they dont so none of that really applies.
this also points otu the problem when FinCEn just arbitrarily decided without congress making a law (and literally while congress was holding hearings saying they didnt want to make laws  about bitcoin yet) that a single government bureaucrat who heads FinCen decided is was another source of revenue for her agency and she declarred bitcoin was currency and therefore subject to her regulation.
bitcoin is NOT currency.
And it is important that it isn't.

FinCen declarations without congressional approval have already shutdown us bitcoin businesses. 
You are giving that a complete pass and that is wrong.
The fincen declarations requiring bitcoin sefvices to be considered money transmitters os a DISASTER.
The businesses to be formed around bitcoin are gone from The usa and forming overseas from that single stupid unauthorized dxtr legal declaration by Fincen.
Bitcoin extends far beyond money and yet fincen has killed most business startups in the usa.
What else is bitcoin?
 New aspect of bitcoin will now store the 80 byte hash of any document or any data that can be hashed (which is almost everything) in the permanent time stamped block chai  account registry of bitcoin. This provides proof of the date and exact wording or contents of any such data at that point in time. Thus bitcoin is moe officially a contract verification service, a record verification service, a proof of prior use of trademark idea, photos, or anything at a point in time. This can revolutio ize record keeping verification.
While the bitcoin block chain doesnt store the actually complete dsta it does prove that the data or contract etc existed at a point in time in an exact provable form that will match that 80 byte hash.
ght and photos and anything that can be hashed.
This is huge.
Thus any government restriction on bitcoin will destroy this vast huge new industry which will displace and so many record keeping functions with a vastley sjperior and more efficient system.
There are other things no one can conceived of forming around the bitcoin system yet they wont happen i  the usa becuase fincen loked at bitcoin only as a money system.

Well arguably most people were in that state in the early 1800's in america. People owned their land and house, grew their food and there were rarely land taxes. 
the problem is those who seek to concentrate wealth and power finds ways to entice people out of their self sufficiency or add new costs on to them so they can't remain self sufficient. (my biggest argument against The new health insurance law is that by forcing people to pay monthly sums like $400 it makes self sufficiecy impossible for many more. (True universal health care that was paid for by general welfare would not do this which is one reason why it would be better and why libertarians and conservative republicans should NOW support that universal health care as an alternative to Obamacare since Obamacare can only be replaced not revoked now. By the way that is not a conservative or liberal thing. it's now a self sufficiency thing.)
One reason people left the old world for the new was for a chance at true self sufficiency which meant owning the land you were on instead of paying some form of perpetual rent which puts you in slavery. It's getting very hard to do that in america now. Some would say impossible unless you inherit your land free and clear and you have enough to both provide for yourself and sell the excess to pay the tax man and now the health care tax man..
so suddenly you need maybe 50 acres where as before you only needed one of two for self sufficiency

$10,000 by mid yr. Perhaps within 2 months when it becomes absolutely obvious to evenone there is arace by wallstreet to secretly buy as much as possible.
I would not be surprised if $100,000 by years end 2014 .
When the big spigot turns on there simply will be armies of processionals whose jobs it is to put a portion of their entrusted billions into the things people possible think might go up.
 Bitcoon is one of those things. Therefore it will happen.
When that happens there is no reason for a slow climb to the price. It simple becomes buying at any price.
My top is still $833,000 per coin which is roughly the equivelent of total goldvalue in bitcoins.
I dont see it happening in this year but again  there really is no reason it couldnt.
When a new oil well is found it doesnt have to slowly rise in price. Professional money investors simply look at the current price of oil and the estjamtds of the barrels in the ground and the well price doesnt climb to that... It just IS THAT.
bitcoin is the same.
Bitcoin largest use to the super money is as an alternative store of wealth. That makes it equivalent to gold . Once the pro billions managers come to that agreement over many lunches and secret runs to their secret massive bitcoin holders for secret address buys (which dont show up in the blockchsin as transactions keeping the price low) the price will just suddenly arrive at around $800,000 per coin.
It wont... But it could..  happen in a month.

You are softballing the hell out of the huge fincen mistake which is literally stopping all new bitcoin industries from forming in the usa right now.
This cannot be over stated.
If you tell them they are doing great becuase you want to kiss up to the congress insteadof actualy answering their questions they will not take the protective action they need to taketo protect bitcoin from being more over regualted and and henpecked by 50 states.
Congress needs to declare  all federal and state regulations off limits for bitcoin for at least 5 yrears so we see what businesses can create in the usa during this time.
Congress did this with ecommerce and they neex to do it with bitcoin.
Tell them this.
You are blowi g your chance to actually tell them they are letting fincen screw this hife new area up for everyone.

First of all ethereum is ether right now and they say 6 months away which is a lifetime in cryptos.
Second even on and likely before deployment it will have challengers. Nothing they are doing is not something everyone else is working on. Including the bitcoin foundation in considering what new features to include at any time.
Third it is nice to have your money separate from your business execution models.
Fourth  things transition over time not instantly. Even if all those things above went ethereum's way  no one sells all their gold and stocks and bitcoin all at once to jump 100% into something until it has been around awhile and been operating for a good long time.
So no it will not kill bitcoin.

I even named it bitgold day and suggested we celebrste when it happens.
I also forecast a huge wall street invest surge this year and  fully expect to see bitcoin eventually level up to $833,000 per bitcoin in the next few years which is the market cap equivelent of gold.
If it hits $10,000 or $100,000 this year it wouldnt surprise me at all with all the wall street funds anticipated to buy into bitcoin.

People spend  money as they need to, and -when they do need to - they will spend the currency that makes ip the majority  of their net worth. In other words people spend the money they have.
As bitcoon is  NOT inflationary it is destined to become the majoroty of their networth for the majority of people investing now. This os becuase it ensures that bitcoin will dramatically rise in value as others rush to invest over time.
Thus EVENTUALLY people will become most  rich through bitcoin and thus when they  eventually want to spend their riches they will be spending bitcoin.

Exactly my thought.
@_date: 2014-01-28 07:43:47
I am happy to revise my thinking but I 'd like to know your statisitics.
For example what percentage of people actually did own their land?
All the big land races gave people their land free and clear and huge areas of the west were settled that way.
lands in east coast were originally deeded by foreigns kings to settlers  mostly free and clear.
I would love to know the percentage of people who did own land free and clear.
as far as the old "stolen from original inhabitants" argument.
Just remember one "indian" tribe stole land from another all the time.
The idea that land was owned by ANYONE before a system of deed recording was put in was wrong.
It was occupied and that occupation changed hands based on wars all the time.
You know recent archeological expedition to Mexico  found that surprise surprise the Spanish armada had not actually wiped out the large indigenous population. The spanish leader reported to the king in spain they had so the king would send more money. and so history recorded they did.
But they lied to the king.
turns out whenthe battlefield was excavated that it was the OTHER indigenious population that was being HELD SLAVES by the OTHER indigeonous population who WITH THE HELP AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA overthrew their enslavers.
They found this by looking at actual battle damage.
they found the skulls were crushed by the weapon of the slaves with very few spanish bullet marks or sword marks on skeletons.
it was the weopons of the indigeous slaves who killed the cruel indigeous population.
I mention this becuase while I want to always protray the TRUTH I also get a tired of this idea that the white guy who came to america was the only bad thing that was happening in America and that the indigenous peoples were all sweet and in harmony with the land. That's baloney.
they were killing and stealing each others lands and enslaving each other all the time.
And the archeological record clearly shows it.
they also routinely over harvested the land and cut down all the trees and caused ecological devastation which sometimes killed off their WHOLE CIVILIZATIONS when the weather suddenly changed.
And the archeological record clearly shows THAT too.
besides all "indigeous" american indians actually ARENT indigenous at all. They are simply ealrier foreign marauders. they are all decended from japanese/asian invaders. This has been proven by genetic matching. They themselves were just previous occupiers of the land from who lived there before and we know who that was. The white clovis peoples. so the "indigeonous people stole the land from the ealrier white people whop probably themselves stole it from someone else. (see how ridicoulous and meaningless this all is?)
so if you want to think about this - and you should - then stop demonizing. 
dont run around hating the white guy.
we shouldn't hate ANYONE for the horrible things they did to each other way back before any of us were born.
We better stick together.
because there are a few people now of all races and colors and nationalities who are screwing over EVERYONE  and one way they  keep doing it is by keeping those who they keep down fighting amongst themselves.
1% owns the amount of world wealth that the whole bottom 50% does. (and that one percent isn't "white people" the bankers and business men are pretty diversified scoundrels.)
If you think a poor white family is any better off or "less oppressed" than a poor native american family or black family you just aren't paying attention to  what is going on internationally and who is running what.
and if you are fighting with others or carring around anger in your head against one group of people who are mostly poor just like every other group on the planet right now that was put in your head by someone else who wants to get you riled up to serve their purpose - you better think about whether it helps you or not.
remember just becuase you saw it on tv doesn't make it true. the people who make and fund tv have their own propaganda that want to put out there and they do it all the time.
PEople lie about history today just like the old spanish fake conquerer who lied to his king. and they do it for the same reason. to get closer to more power and  more money from the people who REALLY exploit everyone.
right now the grpup everyone should be mad at is this banking financial cabal that is pretty much world wide and doing a good job of putting everyone in perpetual debt and very real slavery by any other name.
Remember if you can't pick up and start walking tomorrow with out someone or anyone including debt collectors chasing you , then you are a slave becuase you don't have your true freedom.

Add the reddit predictions as well.
We want to know who is accurate in the future not who was famous when they predicted.
Mine is and always has been  approx. $833,000 per coin which is the total value of all gold ounces at current gold prices divided by the number of bitcoin coins mined now.  The simple  logic is bitcoin is most comparable NOW to gold's wealth protection and storage and inflation hedge aspects and thus should rise to equivalent market cap. Later the other aspects of bitcoin may add more value such as transactions value and world currency but I think that only happens after reasonable expectations for dramatic price rise have leveled off (so people stop hoarding) and I think that happens around gold marketcap.

Dear mr nothing to do,
Both tiddly winks and bitcoin are not currencies but items of varying value based on their popularity which can be traded for other things including other tiddly winks, other virtual ckins and bought and sold for dollars.
I understand you are going to regulate these things to protect the phblic from themselves and to justify your own job existence.
So where do i apply to get my tiddly winks exchanging license?
And if i start trading off brand tiddly winks or tiddly winks credits will i need a different license?
Also please call my kid and tell her why you made her cry.
Ps where do i get my license to trade my car for cash when i want to sell it..
 And if i ttrade on someones birthday is thirr an exception?
Also since you seem most concerned about using the us dollar would it be ok if i began using the chinese wawon instead?

I don't think you should buy anything they are selling.
I just thought the text was very interesting.
It talks about bitcoin in a very easy to understand way and makes the good case for it.
It's also interesting because if multi level marketing peoiple are now getting involved in pitching bitcoin knowledge then a whole new level of people will be educated about bitcoin.
If you have ever seen what happens to the general populations knowledge about something after multilevel marketing starts to get hold of it - you know the knowledge starts reaching people that would never hear about things via the internet or other methods.

@_date: 2014-01-27 16:26:44
I think this WAS true but more and more as places come online so you csn biy things with bitcoin the real question becomes why would anyone want to switch back to fiat in masse?
Remember the PROFITS in bitcoin are  a measure of the relative value of bitcoin against fiat.
If you cash back into fiat the bitcoin relative value still holds.
Unless you dont truly beleive in bitcoin is here to stay as commerce then you begin to not think of fiat as the cash out and profit taking.
Fiat is the risk taking.
Of course this doesnt mean everyone should go all in in either at this moment unless they just like to gamble.

The car is actually of fiberglass construction with stainless steel panels hung on the outside. The panels are not much heavier than normal steel panels, and the panels themselves only make up a small fraction of the total car weight. Although not as light as some small all-plastic sports cars, it is not overly heavy either.

Well actually it IS paftially to prevent you from taking all your money.
It so happens it also coincides with the fact that they dont have all your money in anyplace and they need to shuffle around the real money they do have to people who actually want it.
However the bigger picture here is it demonstrates in very real terms the fact that the banks and the Fed essentially print and loan out money they dont have. While that sounds hypothetical when you hear it on the internet, this fact has real consequences which are very well demonstrated by this very example that you cant get your money out if you really need it.

The key to all these things is buy and hold for the next 5 yrs.
We dont know how many will survive or the relative value but you will always lose just buying when it seems good and selling when it seems bad.
Look either bitcoin and some others will go to $100,000 or it wont it which case it isnt going to change anyone's life substantially unless they got all in 3 years ago.
There is just no logic to jumping in and out.
Just pick a few and hold for a few years.
After the switchers like yourself stop panic trading dogecoin and others for bitcoin new People will likely buy back into dogecoin again for the same reasons they did before. Bitcoin goes skyhigh and its too expensive and complicated in their eyes so they buy a bunch of dogecoin which is bettter supportted at the entry level and often more public..

you dont get medicaid if you dont take a job working for someone else.

so you cant just buy land and be self sufficient anymore.
this is what most people havent realized yet.
It is another difference betweenthe kind of universal health care we SHOULD have and the forced private insuranc eor your a criminal that we are getting.
you will forever be forced into the "work for others" system by this program unless you form a formal company that hires yourself and pays yourself a regular salary. and to do that - well you are still no longer self sufficient becuase you now depend on lawyers, customers and everyone else.
It will be impossible to simply just quit a job and go travel for six months unless you saved up 6x $400 for your health care payments.
do you realize that?
you knpow people dont understand that this programis the first time where you will be forced to pay something even if you dont choose to benefit.
for example you dont have to pay income taxes if you dont choose to make a lot of money and you live wisely and cheaply.
but this is ifferent.
You can't opt out.
You cant choose a different lifestyle if you are willing to take the bad with the good.
You will HAVE to make at least $400 per month AFTER TAXES to pay for your healthcare bill. That likely means living a city lifestyle or at least near SOME business. thatmeans higher rents - less chance to really own land without debt- etc etc.

A relatively tiny amount of worlds money has been invested in bitcoin. (not talking about mining coins. Talking about buying.)
The equivilent price of bitcoin at the same marketcap as gold is $880 000 / bitcoin.
To get there all that has to happen is the similiar valuation as gold which is quit reasonable giving they have very similiar wealth transportability and storage characterisitcs except bitcoin is easier.
That may take a few years but could happen very quickly.
In the mean time all it takes for bitcoin to make the smaller leap to $10 000 or $50 000 or $100 000 is for one big biy from wal street scale money to start a buying panic as people who have been waiting on the sidelines realize they will miss the greatest assest boom of THIS decade if they dont jump in quick.
I think that will happen soon this year. 
You may also see quite a lot of market manipulation to keep the price low for the new whales to get in. Walls treet doesnt like to play fair. Its quite possible the ddos attacks could come from major trading houses.
Major trading houses CONTINUALLY do ddos attacks on the exchanges inthe former of highspeed trades that self cancel jus tto slow down the buys of other trading houses. So they have the expertise in house to do it to bitcoin too. And if it makes bitcoin look weak and lowers the price for their buys then that helps them too.
Remember rapid fire computerized trading to block competitive bids is just status quo strategy for trading houses. They dont even consider it illegal.  Why wouldnt they do the same to bitcoin?
And the volitility is not really much. Look at gold. It has lost similar value and for longer periods and no one thinks it is the end of gold.
Also dont forget there are now several strong alt coins. Tbey will absorb some of the money bit also will allow wall street to hedge their risk in bitcoin and that in the long run makes it both safer and more profitable (because they can charge trading commissions) on trading multiple crypto currencies for their clients.
For them that is better than just having one cryptocurrency to buy and hold.
One other thing.
It is lookin g more and more like  individuals  and companies will start having to have full regulatory licenses eventually to deal in bitcoin. Thus it will be much harder and more expensiv efor the little guy to get into things later
Just like the little guy isnt allowed to buy the stock of a new compnay when its actually cheap and make a lot of money. 
So if you beleive cryptocurrencies will thrive now is the time to get in becuase the barriers to entry will get harder and harder.

For example a fund could easily buy several addresses rather than go an exchange. They wouldnt even need to transfer coins held in the address to another address.x they could simply gqin assurances from large coin holders who have many addresses  that no other person would gain the rights to the private sending key for the addresses purchased.

The major trading houses essentially do ddos attacks over their high speed direct lines to stock exchanges as routine strategy. For example they send floods of high speed orders with auto cancelations streaming to the stock exchwnges to shutdown and fool competitors.
It is no surprise they would do this to bitcoin exchsnges. Its normal for their practices in other exchsnges.
The exciting thing is if they are doing it then they are trying to take positions in bitcoin as we suspected they would this year.
So this is a good sign.

@_date: 2014-03-24 04:19:43
I'll say it.
We have several major wall street people opening up bitcoin to the general public through funds coming up. Not just the Winkletwins but more. One could open any day becuause it is running through a preapproved SEC structure unlike the winklevoss twins. That preapproved group already works heavily on wall street and have the taps open on wall street money.
That will mean millions invested even if the funds are just a tiny percentage of normal portfolios.
I would say $10,000 by the end of the year but it could go a lot higher.
I still have a long term prediction of bitcoin =$150,000 as it reaches a marketcap equal to gold.  
The flood of altcoins has hurt bitcoin somewhat but now with few exceptions the money is coming back out of altcoins and the wall street money will primarily flow to bitcoin I beleive. (altcoins semed a more profitable excursion for a while but after a track record of falling in price after a short term most dont look good anymore. A few with technical advances  seem like long term good ones and of course dogecoin still has huge polularity and if they gethe nascar sponsored will have even more brand awareness. And then there are the aurora coins and other coi s who will actually be given to citizens of nations which will have a huge widespread base and hence inherent value so those may stick aroind)
Once the bitcoin price is affected by the wall dtreet influx even more money will come back out of altcoins and back to daddy bitcoin.
It still woild not surprise me of bitcoin went to $50,000 to $100,000 or more very quickly once those wall strert fu ds get final approval.
The massive prjce pressure will be huge and it will be a race to get in before it stablalises at a gold marketcap.

If someone spends 1 bitcoin from a 5 bitcoin address ma y wallet programs send the remaini g 4 bitcoins to either a new address calling it "change" or some like mycellium send it back to the original address but still call it cha ge.
My question is.... Is that 4 bitcoin transfer also recorded in the blockchain?

My view is that bitcoin will most likely equal the market cap of gold which would make bitcin worth $600,000 PER BITCOIN.
So IF that is true how much would I need to invest right now to be happy if that happens in a couple of years?
The answer is I DO NOT  have to invest ALL 15,000 AND I SHOULDN'T!
maybe ending up with 50,000 in a couple of years is all that I would need .
Maybe $200,000.
The point is you don't have to risk all $15,000 and you shouldn't.
If bitcoin is going to the marketcap of gold and $600,000 PER bitcoin its at $500 now so you could just put in $1000 for 2 bitcoins and possibly end up with $500,000 in the not too distant future.
And you still save your other $14,000 just in case something goes wrong.
IF bitcoin is truly revolutionary and will be adopted like gold then $1000 would be enough to change your life.
If bitcoin doesn't turn out that way then it doesn't matter whether you put $1,000 or $15,000 in so why put in $15,000 and risk it all.
Don't risk it all.
If something did go wrong (if bitcoin collapsed or yours got stolen by computer hackers or the government outlawed it ) and you lost all $15,000 of your savings you would be in a MUCH WORSE POSITION THAN YOU ARE NOW AND SO --  DON'T DO IT.
One of the nice thing s about bitcoin is that its growth POTENTIAL is so extraordinary that you don't have to risk it all to make make a big difference in your life.
So don't ever risk it all.
Unless you could replace all that 15,000 with savings from your salary in a year (and it doesn't sound like that) then that $15,000 is HUGELY IMPORTANT .
That could mean a roof over your head one day and a small piece of land fully paid for instead of a homeless shelter.
Put in only $1000. Either it will be equal to $100,000 and more in a few years ( and wouldn't that be plenty ) OR we are all just overestimating its acceptance and it really doesn't matter.
The important thing is that everyone put in SOME as EARLY AS POSSIBLE.
AND NOT risk everything.
Risking everything is crazy always.
No matter how bad things look now, losing all of that $15,000 would definitely be worse.
Remember you can  fix a horrible tooth pain for $500 and buy an acre of land for $2,000 and fix a car etc etc. with that 15,000. Those things are important!!! If oyu don't have that $15,000 then you could REALLY get in even WORSE shape! Don't risk it all.
You don't need to put in everything you have to change your life if bitcoin is going to become what some people think. SO DON'T RISK IT ALL.
RISKING EVERYTHING WHEN YOU ARE DOWN IS A HUGE MISTAKE. HAVING NOTHING IS much much WORSE THAN HAVING A LITTLE. You only find that out after you have nothing and there is no way to get it back.
In oklahoma even a few thousand $ still can buy you a little piece of land in the country that you can't get kicked off of and you can park your cars and a camper on if you needed to.
$15,000 is a lot of money in oklamhoma. Don't risk it all.
Having no place to sleep or park without having the police being called sucks.
Invest just a little in bitcoin. If people are right then a little should be enough to change your life.
If people are wrong then you didn't lose much. That is the great thing about bitcoin. A little investment is probably enough.
That's the way I look at it.
Most of all whatever you put in you have to not touch for a couple of years or until you make enough to really change your life.
You can't worry if it goes down for two months or more. Its possible it might. You have to hang on for a few years to see what the final potential of bitcoin really is. And it might be huge. 
I think that anyway. Its logical.

All you need is to put up your QR CODE.
You have a form for customers to fill out for shipping if needed.
You have them enter their public payment address if you want.
You watch the block chain to see when the payment arrives in your account from That address.
You ship.
You don't need anything else  technically.
Now of co urse you can automate things with scripts and things if you want but all you really Need is for the customer to give you a email for digital products or a real address for physical and simply check your payment address whenever an order is placed.
If you don't have a cost product that will lose you money if you aren't paid then you can simply provide immediate access to a download link once they click a button that says they paid you and trust them.
Or you can as I said monitor your Bitcoin address for the proper transfer from their address if you must wait for proof of their payment.

shocked - wellnot really - more heartsickened- at that story about the 401K.
But of course he may be trained to say that becuase the companies typically get paid to keep certain 401k investment possibilities in their plans and those payers can demand 100% participation.
Besides really the 401K reinvestment scan is a remake of the old barowner scam - The bar owner pays his workers thenoffers them a free drink at the end of each night. The workers sit around and start drinking and thus give back a large percentage of their wages back to the bar owner.
The 401K scam is another version. In many cases the company "offers" (often with much internal "believe inthe company" pressure) the possibility for the employees to reinvest their wages right back into company stock directly giving the company back the money ythey just earned.
This of course makes the stock go up in value making the CEO's bonus stay higher every year and if the stockis purchased directly formthe company it gives the company literally their money back.
Thenof course an Enron happens where all the empolyees have the bulk of the money they have been paid in Enron stock from 10 yrs of working and they lose it all when the pryamid schemes collaspe. So they worked for the CEO for 10 years for living expenses becuase all their savings went to the busted stock.

Pay the paltry taxes of 20% or 33% or whatever on it that year.
401K's are just another promise to pay.

Actually the $833 000 thousand if you actually read the post is the $10 trillion in us saving accounts earning no interest  divided by the 12 million bitcoins in circulation which gives $833 000.
Learn to read.
Personally i beleive that bitcoin will more likely equate its capitalization rate with gold's since i beleive bitcoin is a comparable store of wealth.
I do t have the numbers in front of me now but if you divide t he  total current valuation of gold at about $1200 per  ounce  times the number of world ounces and divid that by the same 12 million bitcoin available you get  a valuation of around $600 000 per bitcoin.
The problem dadkwings is you have an agenda .
You also dont have any idea about the amount of wealth in the world so you think bitcoins paltry valuation today is high.
You sinply have no concept pf how much money other people in the world have and how little a percentave of that bitcoin currrntly represents.
Bitcoinhas no where to go but up over the next year unless its cryptography is broken or it is outlawed. And since being outlawed made drugs increase in value it is arguable to say that even if bitcoin was outlawed it might be worth more.

Ok realistically I look for bitcoin to be considered an attractive welath allocation compared to Gold so I think the marketcap of Nitcoin should equal gold or more and so Bitcoin goes to around $600,000/bitcoin assuming about 12 million currently mined bitcoins.
World investors like to sink a certain portion of their assets in a super safe cross border wealth allocation like Gold and now Bitcoin will compete for that money.
so logically bitcoin marketcap should equal gold (or better becuase bitcoin actually has huge advantages over gold - easy to store, carry, keep hidden, you take actual possession easily, etc etc.

I put predict what most early adopters WHO HAVEN'T already bailed out will do is slowly sell off peices of their holdings to ensure their lifestyle gains but will remain beleivers in the eventual huge future increases so also keep in the game as much as they can.
The ones still in now after the last peak of six months ago are different than the ones who bailed out totally back then.
The ones still in made the decision back then when the money was seemingly high that bitcoin is FUNDEMENTALLY going to rise very highh .
The ones who bailed out  6 months ago sort of beleived but  weren't as sure it wasn't a fluke.
Personally i beleive that the ones who got in when it was game currency and a fun geek pastime never understood the FUNDEMENTAL advantages bitcoin has and therefore didn't have that to hold them in.
The ones who got in say at $10 or $50 or $100 or $200 were not thinking it was a fluke at all but had analyzed comparative investment opportunities and saw a FUNDEMENTAL VALUE in bitcoin's future place as a Asset allocation reserve.

actually any huge pump move now would so increase price and volume that it would further legitimize the currency which would raise the intrinsic value betond the dump price.
bitcoin is still in the undiscovered country.
we are the ones  investing in the land containing the little known pile of gold that most investors dont yet know exists.
bitcoin at 21 million coins has a intrinsic value equal to all other world currencies because it is useable by all and it cant be destroyed by one country(the latter often limits value of a nations currency).
when everyone already has a stake in bitcoin THEN we can discuss what price is the right final value.
as long as most people still dont know it and havent yet purchased any it is far from long term speculative potential. 
right now we are still at the stage of buying land containing a relatively unknown gold mine containing as much gold as the sum total of al other currencies.
bitcoin MUST eventually equalize in sum value to the sum exchange value of other currencies because it will be universally exchanged therefore value will be driven to the intrinsic balance  level.

I nother words you can't go to court and say because this person promised me bitcoin I can claim something else as a defacto value  of the bitcoin.. no bitcoin has no set official value. Duh.
none the less :
"Although it is called currency, it is not issued by a monetary authority, it does not have the status of legal tender and obliged payment status of currency, it is not currency in the true sense. Bitcoin is a specified virtual commodity, it does not have equal legal status with currency, and it cannot and should not be circulated as currency on the market."

If it was about a currency I wouldn't have posted it 
The reason I posted it is because namecoin is about domain name registration using a bitcoin type blockchain that like bitcoin isn't centralized.
Yes apparenty you can buy and sell names and they use a thing called namecoin to provide an incentive structure like bitcoin does but  thier coins are only really mining incentives for domains to keep the blockchain supported.
In a way they are a domain name system that takes bitcoins or through exchanges takes bitcoins to you allow you to set up a decentralized domain name site so its little different than any other bitcoin vendor who provides things in exchange for bitcoin. Its a good thing.
As I said it also provides a big margin of safety from censorship for bitcoin and many other things if ever needed.
Those are all good things and other wise I wouldnt mention it.
I don't beleive we should talk about other altcoins either. But this is more domain name registration and not really an altcoin primarily.
It also is an example of why bitcoin type technology is so good and blockchain tech ology is so good and that also supports and reassures new people about the credibility of the blockchain type structure bitcoin uses.
That is also good.
Again, I am just learning about this myself and  have no connection to namecoin and don't own any domains (although I think I will register one to be able to avoid icann censorship if necessary). But it does seem like some good mutually supporting technology that people should be aware of.
Personally i wish they called it bitdomains instead of namecoin because I think that would lessen the confusion and still reference the underlying bitcoin blockchain type technology.

hide it under your house or something.
never cash out.
The pennies won't make a difference in your life now but if bitcoin reaches a market cap of it's main competitor gold it will be worth $600,000 PER BITCOIN.  Not $1,000 but $600,000 per bitcoin. It was PENNIES 3 yrs ago and now it is $800! if it goes up the same amount in three more years it will be around $100,000 per bitcoin!
Why would you throw away a chance at that kind of money for a few beers you will forget? double profit of $400 is NOTHING. It will make NO DIFFERENCE in your life. You can make that in a week or two at minimum wage!
Wait at least one yr and just see where things are. My guess is by then it wil be widely talked about like gold and huge money will have been poouring in and it will be in the thousands and headed for marketcap equivelence of gold.
You will likely never again have a real logical chance at getting that kind of value for what you have. You may NEVER again have that. If you sell out you will be seriously mentally crippled for life knowing what you could have had.

It is indeed parabolic and not only that but increasing parabolic.
And this natural.
Bitcoin is a newly discovered storage tank for wealth.
If you have an empty hole in the ground surrounded by water tanks you get not only an increasingly flow into the hole but an increasing increasing flow as the sluices are turned wider and wider letting more flow from each tank.
We are experiencing both an increasing number of tanks opening to drain to bitcoin and also each is opening its sluice wider. (And weh aven't even experinced the ginat funds who take longer to switch allocations!)
This the increasing increasing parabolic fill rate.
Furthermore the controller of each flow sees that the bitcoin hole is finite at 12 million spaces thus they realize they must actually race the other tank owners to gain a cheap spot in the empty tank.
It could fill in a month to a marketcap of gold or fill in two years .
There literally is no limit other than the rate and willingness of current bitcoin holders to sell.
Its amazing.

price went from $80 to $99 right now on bitfloor as the availble bitcoins below $99 were quickly snapped up.
What you are seeing is the real market. they are clearing trades as you can see while watching it live so whatever ddos if happeneing is not stopping trades.

they can.
 **The NSA's Tor Stinks presentation talks about a subprogram called QUANTUMCOOKIE: "forces clients to divulge stored cookies." My guess is that the NSA uses frame injection to surreptitiously force anonymous users to visit common sites like Google and Facebook and reveal their identifying cookies. Combined with the rest of their cookie surveillance activities, this can de-anonymize Tor users if they use Tor from the same browser they use for other Internet activities.**"

fastest way to buy is through blockchain.info which allows instant purechase using bitinstant through moneygram in usa.
creat your wallet on blockchain.info.
click on buy with cash.
takes you to bitinstant with your wallet number.
that takes you to moneygram to zipzap in sanfrancisco which takes a moneygram order.
you print that order and go to any moneeygram location like say CVS drug store and give them your cash or debit card for the "bill pay".
you instantly get a email in about 10 minutes saying the moneygram worked and zipzap also confurms by email and within 30 minutes the bitcoin were in my wallet at blockchain.info .
print out a paper backup and unless someone steals it somehow its done and its your money!

an advisor on max keiser just said that if everyone just put 2.5 percent of their deposits into bitcoin that the value of 1 bitcoin would go to 700,000 PER BITCOIN.

it is JUST hitting the news radar really. it went from $95 yesterday to 113 before i could buy some today.

Thats what i would do too for such a large amount.
Specifically i would call the one who is already formed  whose name i fprget.
Since they had the best performance last year im sure cash has flooded them and they may have a hafd time getti g enough bitclin.
Someone could probably negotiate a private fixed price at a slightly higher than  market rate just for convenience to them.
Also that may be mpre than you could get if yousold ot quickly on the market which might depress the prices somewhat. (i dont know. What is relative volume these days?)
I personally think after the beginning of the year there would be a lot more hedge fund buyers since 2014 looks to be the big year for wall stredt money to initally flow into bitcoin on a large basis.

You are missing the fat more important news.
All the wall streeters who have told you that hundreds of millions are going to be invested in bitcoin 2014.
People forget.
In the REAL world of investing those with real money have to choose between alternative investments.
Right now there is NO investment on the planet that has the possibilty of producing even 20% return for the passive investor .
Except Bitcoin which has the potential to produce a return that is incomparable by anything else known today.
Tomorrow when people wake up and realize this they will wonder what the hell am I going to do with the money I pullled out of bitcoin?
They will then decide to rebuy bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:46:23
I guess they are forced to buy bitcoin at whatever price exists when they make their order and that needs to be soon after getting fund injections. (Otherwise in a rising price era they undercut their own goal for the fund.)
This will provide much deeper substance and floors to bitcoin pricing.

Doesn't have to replace all to gain a similiar cap rate. Yours is a common fallacy in thinking.
However as Bitcoin gathers acceptance I would not hestitste to think it could displace 50 or more % of bank deposits.
After all what percentage of personal address books are now contsinedin cellphones? What percentage of written corespondance is now  done in email containers?
Those are both EXTREMELY  personal,private and in many cases more valuable assests to many people yet they now routinely trust them to computer conveance.
Money is similar. For most people money in banks accounts is not as personal or important as those other things. Most people are not carrying huge amounts in banks accounts and most would replenish what they carry in a few months if it was lost.
Therefore the transition and risk factor of them putting their money in Bitcoin wallets is less than many assume I beleive.

This is amazing.
[–]Darkwings_08[S] -2 points 7 hours ago*
I actually have Bitcoin from 2010 and 2011 and that I mined on my HD5770 (srs)
I first heard of Bitcoin back in late 2010 through a youtube user by the name of 'davincij15'. I investigated it and discovered its serious flaws which affect it's long-term viability (and impair it's current use), but I mined a few BTC for fun/speculation because I already had one of the best and most efficient cards for the job, and it only cost a few dollars in electricity.
I'll be honest with you: I was interested in selling them given the recent price rises, but upon trying to sign up to the exchanges, I quickly gave up that idea. You can take your chances if you want, but I'm not giving them my personal documents.
Plus, I've got actual investments to worry about, unlike shitcoin."
I knew it. You actually have a bunch of bitcoins your are holding on to becuase you know they will rise invalue.
All your smack talk is simply trying to drive the price down so you can get more cheaply.
That's amazing to finally see you admit.
I just wonder do you not withdraw money from your bank account becuase they ask you for identification !

replying to preserve your info
"Sales manager from First Data here. The short explanation as to why companies like yourself have these problems is because 3rd party processors and specially bank merchant service providers apply restrictions on business types, processing methods, etc... mostly based on risk. I know full well that many legitimate businesses have been unjustly black listed (GTF/CTMF) because they did some minimal amount/method outside their merchant service provider's acceptance limits. (Shameless plug: I can accept accounts without 99% of these restrictions. Some industries by nature still give even us trouble.)
Bitcoin is still not liked among &gt;50% of merchant service providers. Again, because the 3rd party companies add restrictions to their merchants to shield themselves to possible chargebacks in the future. This is a pressing topic in the industry due to the growth and use of bitcoin.
My professional opinion is that bitcoin has an uphill battle to get much bigger than it is now. I know it will grow, but you know those little names on the back of your debit cards? STAR, INTERLINK, MAESTRO, NYCE.... As of Jan. 2013 they are now completely owned by the big banks. That means that with every debit card purchase, the big banks are getting a piece. And they won't be happy losing that piece to anyone.
But I hate to see this happen and 99% of the time I can offer a solution to where you don't have to deal with these surprises or difficulties. I hope this helps a little and I'd be happy to help in any way. Whether it's with my business or my advice.

It's outlawing that would be scary and by coming out and saying it is a legal commodity they have  a harder time ever outlawing Bitcoin.
Some regulation is fine.
If it drives more buying to the Us makrets that would be good too. I doubt the Chinese would be as stupid as the US Congress  and Fincen is being though. I frankly think China views bitcoinas a way to establish financial dominance in the competition for world finace exchange by letting bitcoin market go more in China than in the USA.

You are now totally off track due to bobby lee making a mistake here I  his interpretation of the advisory.
The advisory said anyway and any business except financial institutions can use Bitcoin at their own risk.
The advisory also said that since the RMB is the ONLY OFFICIAL currency that no one can be FORCED to use Bitcoin. Bobby lee misinterpreted that to mean no one can legally use Bitcoin which the advisory clealry states elsewere is wrong.
It says any business or person except for the financial businesses listed can use Bitcoin at their own risk.

The wall street types are  reporting  they will invest  100 million in bitcoin next year.
Just put the coins in a paper wallet in a closet where your dog can't eat them and wait until the end of 2014 and see where things are.
That's my plan unless it hits $100,000 before the end of 2014. Then I might sell a few or wait until it hits gold market cap at $600 000.

@_date: 2013-11-30 09:05:19
edit. I just tipped you 25 cents so you can play with that and try all this out.
Print a 10 address wallet from bitadress.org which actually doesn't ever send the stuff over the internet. The webpage uses javascript on your machine to make the wallets.
Print them out in multiple copies and store those copies separately in several places 
SO if one stash is found they can't get everything, and of one stash is lost you have other copies of all your addresses.
Then when you get a bitcoin address filled with one coin somewhere  use mycellium for android and import that PRIVATE QR address into your phone . Now your phone can SPEND fromthat ONE ADDRESS.
Now import the QR PUBLIC codes from your printed sheets into your mycellium wallet.
Now use it to transfer some of your coin to each wallet. 
That way  even your phone can't spend them if someone steals your phone or hacks your phone becuase your phone doesn't have the PRIVATE SPEND QR CODE for any wallet except theoriginal one and you moved most of your coin outof that one into the other ones.
Your phone can only SEND TO those ten addresses so all you can lose is the remnents in your original address if hacked or stolen.
Now do you know the greatest risk of botcoin loss?
Two things.
1. You forget passphrases or passwords and they are lost forever.
2, someone hacks an one line wallet or the company shuts down.
So 
1. dont use passphrase extra passwords or anyhting like that. store the random password wallets as printed by bitaddress.org. hid them and divid them but make sure you have everything you need on paper you can get to to store and retreive your money.
You will LOSE YOUR MONEY IF you print and use and then forget any passwords that aren't on a peice of paper with your wallets. you will lose them forever. so don't use those memory passwords. you will be putitng these things in drwaers soemwhere and never touching them so you WILL FORGET THE PASSWORDS! Unless you are in a school or prison, theft of your peices of paper is not as great a risk as you forgetting passwords!
2. don't use online wallets to store your coin. when you do that someone else has your passwords and thus your coins not you even if they say its' your wallet. If they get shut down or hacked the coins are permanently gone.
at bitaddress.org select 
paper wallet
hide art check this  -not pretty but easier to input inthings and takes much less space.
NO bit38 encrypt (if you forget your password ...GONE FOREVER)
NO passphrase - leave it empty
addresses to generate 7  or 10 or however many you want on one page. 
Maybe 3 per sheet and print two copies and then do another (hit "genrate" again)  and print of each sheet and hide them around wherever you put important stuff.
the codes on the right are the PRIVATE CODES . DONT LOAD THEM INTO ANY WALLET OR PHONE
Load only the ones on the left.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:10:47
thanks! you rock.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:10:47
This is why it is so important that people not go crazy with over encryption.
Spread coins around to a few paper wallets with normal private keys.
Store those in several different places and not all together if you are paranoid about losing everything .
Mattress ,yard , safe deposit box ... Whatever you feel comfortable with.
Keep a small spending one in your phone.
Don't ever have anything that requires you to remember something or lose it all without a backup.
You will forget... Especially for things you don't use all the time .
Regular paper wallet print outs are good. If large amounts don't keep them all I on e structure that could be destroyed in a catastrophy
Take a photo of some of them.  Good old polaroids. Or hide a digial camera sd card .
Just not everything in one place so if it is lost no one can get everything.
And don't put everything you own into anyone thing ever.

If you use an old computer with no built in WiFi and boot to an 
Old operating system.
Then load a floppy disc with the bitcoinaddress.org website loaded on it .
Then generate your addresses and keys. You print them (several copies)
You then destroy the floppy disc without ever putting it into any other computer (so it can't  possibly copy remnants of a virus grabber if on the floppy)
Then you load only the public addresses into your android phone .
Then you transfer all your coins into all those new addresses.
Its pretty near impossible that anyone is going to get your public keys unless they come inside your house.

Actually the USA has already declared Bitcoin completely legal to own and use. They did that BEEFORE China also declared Bitcoin completely legal to own and use.
Us financial institutions already can only invest in certain classes of invest.ends based on the safety requirements of the money. Banks,  savings and loans, insurance companies and some utilities etc  can only invest in "safe things" ( supposedly) and giant  private fundsthat aren't government guaranteed sided can invest in just about anything.
Of course they all learned to get around these rules by writing derivatives in safe things that had payouts based on risky things but whatever..

I have seen from personal experince that overwhelming public response to congress can delay and  even kill legislation by extremely powerful business interests.
The response however needs to be overwhelming.
Congress still likes their cushy jobs more than their  money benefactors who they kiss only to keep campaign money to keep their jobs.
Issues that appear to possibly cause widespread voter backlash still trump big business forces. they are the ONLY issues that can overcome those forces.
Remember the death and tone down and delay of SOPA FOR YEARS.

looking at this
it seems what I should be asking is how many zeros must the hash have in recent blocks.
lokking at recent blocks here:
Difficulty 	1,180,923,195.2580261
Bits 	419668748
Size 	0.2548828125 KB
Version 	2
Nonce 	3125706805"
the bits and difficulty values are not changing.
the nonce length is jumping all over the place so apparently the nonce length has no reltaionship to the end hash length or difficulty.
what exactly is the "bits" value?
what exactly is the "difficulty" value? I know they increase difficulty to ensure a new block is created on average in a certain time period but what does the actual number mean or express?
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:20:02
Well I am not so sure becuase if you think about the bank issuing fractionalized money (say $100,000 mortgage based on the require reserve amount on deposit for other depositors) to a person to buy a house they actually issue something that is cashed in by the previous owner. that previous owner deposits the $100,000.
bitcoin cannot be cashed in by the previous owner unless it is real bitcoin becuase there is no blockchain support for the bitcoin that is issued fractionally.
therefore banks could only fractionalize bitcoin if the end stuff was going to someone who would not in anyway retransfer it again.

There was a guy here who had gotten his when they were pennies or dollars a piece and he sold when he had $1,000,000 right around the temporary peak of about $200ish.. The million would change his life and he was pretty sensible for doing it. He said he was using it to buy land.
At some point more money doesn't matter for most people.
He locked in his life changing event and will be forever richer for it.
Personally I hope he bought back in a little to stay in but he made a smart move in any case. He choose to start living his dream then and not wait and you can't say it's the worng thing.

i showed one analysis based against price and scarcity of gold ounces which is an equivelent currency. that figured out to over $400,000US per bitcoin.
in any case any fundemental analysis o relative worth and scarcity compared to other means of wealth storage puts bitcoin at 100s of 1000s US$ PER BITCOIN.
arguing about a value of around 100$ is like counting individual raindrops before a hurricane.

I am convinced bitcoins ultimate world value will be seen as an alternative to gold that can be purchased and carried and cashed and actually used if needed but not relative to volume.
I really feel far more international capital will flow to bitcoin as a hedge against bank or currency seizures/collapse/devaluation than for consumer purchases.
However merchants will be even happier to take minute amounts of bitcoin for purchases as the value climbs. They'll be more willing than to do bitcoin which can be automated through checkouts than say breaking a chip off an ounce of gold which is damn hard to squeeze through those internets tubes. LOL.

remember to constantly ground yourself before and while you touch it. Easiest way is to grab and hold a metal faucet. and then work on the piece right there without moving walking - especially no walking on carpets in dry winter weather! Put the drain in the sink and then a towel in the sink so no lost pieces!
first maybe can use without fixing like this
get another cheap usb drive for pieces.
take off the metal box connector from the cheapo and slide it on yours and see if you can just hold it at angle in your usb slot and have it make contact without soldering
tips appreciated!
now if  you do decide to try soldering FIRSt go buy a $20 DEsolderer from radioshack.
with it you can heat and suck up any solder you get all over the place ... and you will.
then get a soldeirng iron and solder form radio shack for about $15 and practice. dont get a very hot or high powered one becuase you dont want to fry your circuits.
also hold any metal peice you touch with the soldering iron with metal tweezer so you don't over heat it and burn out the circuits.
Now if all that scares you go to an RC airplane or car meetup group in your neighborhood and find a guy with a soldering iron to do it for you.

Bitcoin is clearly legal for us in trade and commerce for every person and business except financial company's. The advisory was clear.

Well that's a problem.
If the Chinese banks wanted to tell people they couldn't use Bitcoin for purchases then they should... Context makes its own context.

I guess the real question is "do they mean established payment agencies using currecny can't start using bitcoin too?"
If that is what they mean then it is ok for a new company setup only to be a bitcoin exchange _ which they allow clearly _ to setup so bitpay would be fine.
I read it as meaning established payment agencies with reputations and licensing can't start doing bitcoin. They want those to remain pure just lime the use of the term currency.
But they do t care if another company comes along and does a bitpay thing as long as they don't confuse people who might not u derstand they are transacting in bitcoin which could be more risky.
It seems to be clearly written to keep a well established definition and CLASS of LICENSED regulated companies from confusing by the public by now using bitcoin.
Whereas it clearly allows other companies to use bitcoin as exchange as long as there a re no repesentations that might lead to consumer misunderstanding about what they were getting.

Been around for decades with no harmful effects..only test ever showing a fake cancer link was done when it was blended with something else and force feed by the gallon to rats and the test was funded by true makers of sacharrins only competitor, aspartatame. The company , g d searles' president was lying war fraudster secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld.
Rumsfeld also got Reagan to appoint an extra member to the FDA panel which broke the tie that kept getting aspartame refused for safety reasons. They had to push aspartame becuase gd searle's patent had run out on sacharrin so anyone could soon sell their cash cow and compete with them. So they had to start marketing the much inferior and dangerous wood alciohol producing aspartame.
And so with the fake test on sacharin Rumsfeld got the FDA to label the former top product sacharin a cancer risk so it got switched out of all the diet colas for.... You guessed it aspartame.
Of course after rumfled didn't care anymore people challenged the FDA about sacharrin and they removed the cancer risk warning.. which is why you don't see the cancer warning on sacharrin any more.
So saccharrin is the safest sweetner dispute the fact most people erronously still think it causes cancer.

However by using leverage a standard hedge fund can aslo have its value reduced to zero. It is ultimately not the asset which is valued but the owners position in it.
For example an owner can own a 50 million dollar shopping center with leverage that has debt service causing his position to go negative if the rents drop below debt service. . So being unleversged has its advantages and lowers risk.
And if your underlying assest has exponential growth there is less reward for using leverage especially when it would be at a premium
And the intrinsic value of bitcoin means it will never drop to zero. That's been argued before. Research it.

Let's just remember that even if every single company in China stopped accepting Bitcoin as a purchasing option it would make NO DIFFERENCE because Bitcoin **has not grown based on being currency** dispite the utopian dreams of some associated with it who really want to be able to **buy pizza** with their Bitcoin.
**Bitcoin has grown based on people wanting a digital alternative store of wealth - gold 2.0.**
And as a digital replacement for gold **there is still 600X upside before Bitcoin reaching market parity with Gold.  That's $600,000 per Bitcoin.**
Baidu has not **ever had a gnat's ass worth of their purchases be in Bitcoin** and neither has any other retailer.
Baidu just started accepting Bitcoin a month or two ago.
Remember **China has FIRMLY COME OUT and declared Bitcoin is LEGAL AS A COMMODITY LIKE GOLD.**
I know some people want to be able to buy their internet or pizza or lollipops with their bitcoin but that isn't and **never has been the primary reason people are buying Bitcoin.**
People are buying it because it is a **shelter and safety and transportable and secure and mostly private means to store their wealth** across country borders without banks.
You can still always go buy and sell your Bitcoin from reall people on the street at localbitocins.com and then buy your pizza. And again **China has CLEARLY and DEFINITELY said it is LEGAL for people to buy and sell Bitcoin .**
There is NO dispute about that.
I suspect Baidu is halting bitcoin payment until they get some clarification after the notice precisely because it matters so little to their bottom line . As soon as they get a little more certainty after the recent announcement by China they will probably put it back. Hell Baidu probalby has been reading the wrong stuff posted on r/Bitcoin and got worried they might be doing something wrong they said why risk it and took it down.

Banks weren't banned becuase they feared money laundering.
Banks were banned because China didn't want Banks misrepresenting to people that the Banks could help them buy Bitcoin with a bunch of fees and didn't want them trying to take over Bitcoin and corrupting it with 
leverage and speculation.
The statement about not using Bticoin for laundering money had nothing to do with that.
IT had  to do with China saying once and for all that Bitcoin was completely legal for citizens and businesses to buy and sell and trade and hold as they like except they could not use it to launder money.

A lot of the people in the top billionaires list now were not there 30 ,yrs ago.
This won't change the wealthy in oil or real estate etc.
It will just add another group.
The interesting question is what will happen to the USA who has benefited greatly from having the world's reserve currency that they can print.
That will be a huge change unless somehow they can peg their currency to bitcoin.
It might force policies. That promote true economic growth like high wages and disposable income for more people becuase the finacial manipulators will have less relative power in lawmaking and they have been the ones stopping that.
American democracy reacts slowly but decisively when needed and a collapse of the old financial manipulators ( which won't be complete but partial) may change polciy.
Also remember most current financial millionaires WILL buy into bitcoin before the top so they will benefit as well.
No one else will be able to buy in now at the same SCALE as they can.
So the earliest adopters will have billions and the later ones like now buying in normal amounts will make millions and those who put spare money in at $100 will probably make a milion and the rest might make an extra couple hundred thousand becuase that all regular people can afford to invest reasonably.
Bitcoin has doubled now three times in what ...6... months?
That assumes a end range of $600,000 per bitcoin as the bitcoin market cap equals the current gold market cap which is where I think if will end up.
Interestingly gold may actually be partially abandoned which I hadn't thought of before. Others have pointed out there is less reason to invest in gold as insurance if bitcoin exists and some articles have said that gold is actually going down and maybe its becuase bitcoin competes as a wealth insurance reserve.

@_date: 2013-11-13 04:50:29
I would read this question verbatum
Begin quote
Why are you (the Winklevosses) only saying $40,000 per bitcoin? as in the IBT article today?
A realistic comparative marketcap analysis to gold is approx 6,141,197,000 ounces of mined gold exist ( more everyday) at $1,200 /ounce = $7,369,436,400,000 market cap (that's seven TRILLION dollars) 
Bitcoin is more spendable and transportable and hideable and "backupable" than Gold.
Bitcoin is now nearly as financially entrenched and supported around the world and and by next year certainly will be and certain MORE accesible RIGHT NOW for the small buyer or user. 
Therefore Bitcoin actually has ADVANTAGES over Gold as everything except a conductor of electricity therefore the marketCap of Bitcoin should eventual EXCEED Gold not just equal it.
11 million Bitcoins exist (up to 25 million max) at same MarketCap is $669,948 / bitcoin. (at current 11 million mined )
Therfore the correct, pure fact based, unemotional,quantitative analysis of Bitcoin's reasonable value is $669,948 / per Bitcoin or higher.
We don't you say that instead of $40,000 / Bitcoin?
The emotional reluctance of  the slow human acceptance of fundemental change should not be a reason to underestimate the value of a financial market which clealry on fundemental anaylis should eventually exceed the MarketCap of gold because of it's comparitive holding advantages.
End quote.

My long term target as always is in the neighborhood of total bitcoin being worth total gold which puts bitcoin at about $600,000 per bitcoin.
Same as it ever was. The fundamentals or math or logic hasn't changed by any of the few panic selloffs we have had in 2 years they go down about half and then in three months it's up 2 times its previous high..
Steady exponential adoption curve. just like for the past three years.
It'll be that curve until a significant portion of the value of gold wealth is also invested in Bitcoin. Or until someone permanently breaks it or outlaws it which is unlikely.

There is no such thing as technical analysis.
There is only fundamental analysis.
Fundamentally bitcoin needs to equalize at least at the market cap of gold or $600,000 per bitcoin as a similar portion of world wealth flows into it , and probably much more becuase it is so much better than gold and is a currency and transaction medium all in one.
Therefore the only question is how fast will the money flow into it? How fast will the price rise.
There is no other analysis of any value.

So the panic selling is caused by people not being able to take new deposits to buy more Bitcoin in China.
Bobby lee also said they will find new thrid party payment processors to do that.
So right now we have a situation where in China people can only sell and physically cannot buy.
That what I understand him to say.
He also repeated that ,contrary to what was falsely posted here by others, China  did definitatively declare on Dec 5 that bcitcoin were legal for people to buy and sell.
That means the minute bobby lee finds a new third party payment processor the people in China who want to buy but can't should start buying like crazy at the historic low price and the price should skyrocket.
Meanwhile the rest of the world is planning on putting millions more into bitcoin next year according to those speaking about wall street.
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:15:16
But the Chinese are free to trade anything for bitcoin. They just can't use third  party payment processors.
So they could buy say silver or even copper ingots and trade them immediately for Bitcoin somewhere right?
For a exchange it is no more risky for them to be holding silver In  exchange than it is to hold bitcoin as long there operating costs are low and they take a percentage of each trade. They can allways cash out of silver just like cash each day to lower their holding risk.

Imagine what happens when a tenth of one percent of the trillions in investment funds get into bitcoin then...
1,000,000,000,000 /100 = 10,000,000,000 ten billion
One tenth of one percent is therefore ...
1 BILLION dollars that would flow to bitcoin if ONLY 1 TENTH OF ONE PERCENT WENT INTO BITCOIN
What's normal? ONE PERCENT of the Trillions is in SILVER RIGHT NOW.
So if you think it would hit $1000 if 10 million comes in then 100 TIMES that amount = 1 billion would AT LEAST make it 100 times more valuable or $100,000. (actually the difference in value increase is usually exponential in demand curves like this though so it might go CONSIDERABLY higher)
NOW you see why people are saying it is perfectly REASONABLE for bitcoin to hit  in the $100's of thousands of dollars.

    an increasing number of tanks opening to drain to bitcoin
    But insofar as this is just people following the herd, it will get unwound.
no evidence of that in 3 yrs. and the fundementals are agaisnt you. its adoption worldwide shows it is not herd but steady recognition of its fundemental value.
    A claim of double-exponential growth or increasingly parabolic growth requires a very solid argument. 
which I provided and is actually seen inthe numbers. It's not conjecture. it's in the numbers.
    We usually see an increasingly parabolic pattern only just prior to bubble bursts.
there has never been a innovation like bitcoin inthe financial world. W saw parabolic adoption of email,  the printing press, gas cars, smartphones, etc etc. parabolic adoption is an idication of widespread recognition of purpose .
    However, the recent correction has actually returned the growth to the merely exponential rate of the past few weeks. If we do go over $1000 this week, it will be back in "increasingly parabolic" territory.
We hit $100 again today.
I am thinkign we'll be over the ounce price of gold on Monday when the news hits  the monday papers.
we used to double every 4 months.
we may double in a week  now (it was $600 what two days ago?) as the floodgates open and big money takes a natural allocation position in bitcoin.

Honestly, once I realized that bitcoin would at the least displace gold and at least  coexist with it as one of the world's largest wealth repositories and that meant it would be at least over $600 000 ... Well Zen until the time .
Because it is an analysis that simply can't be faulted on its merits.
Because it makes perfect sense.
Once you see it isn't about GUESSING but it is about practical common sense that bitcoin would occupy that spot in the world the little jumps and turns no longer matter.
The hard part is trying not to spend some because you have to adjust your whole mentality about what your desires and opportunities will be in a few years. You don't want to short circuit those by spending some bitcoin now.

You don't have $50 bucks?
Any college kid can get $50. Eat ramon noodles and no beer for a week.
get $50 and go to localbitcoins.com and meetup with someone at your local cooffee shop with mycellium loaded on your cell phone and buy $50 worth.
Do it now.
It might be a $10,000/ bitocin in two weeks. It went that fast to $1200.

If you were an exchange owner/CEO like NYSE or NASDAQ or a foreign exhacnge and you saw a leader in trading of something your exchange didn't trade and you suddenlly saw worldwide interest in the buying and SELLING of this product and you wanted to not be outside this space - can you honestly tell me you wouldn't be making offers?

Because on NOV 22 when you order  the backlog may be so high that you'll get them at whatever a higher price that exists on Novemebr 25th.
With prices rising so fast they have to do this.

But considering the fact that each decision maker will start with a least one then the number of addresss actually used in the blockchain so far indicates the MAXIMUM number of decision makers who will have concluded bitcoin is worthwhile geting invollved with.

Just a reminder to never make copies of your paper wallet using a commercial copy machine like at Fed ex kinkos.
Those machines store all images scanned on an internal harddisk which can and has been read by people who later buy or have access to that copier by removing the harddisk.

This is excellent.
This means that Bitcoin is no where near its final acceptance level therefore there is tremendous growth left.
I would have been very concerned if 90%  had said it was investment safe or not a fad.
That would have meant it had reached widespread adoptance.
I do not expect the average person to have any ability to understood why Bitcoin is a superior technology any more than I expect them to understand TCP IP protocol.
I expect the majority to accept it only when everyone else does and when  they have used it regularly. 
This proves Bitcoin is still at its infancy in valuation.
The adoption and recognition by the tech community proves that Bitcoin WILL become mainstream.

$800 is not normal.
$800 is incredibly incredibly undervalued.
Bitcoin is an alternative to gold and will seek at least a marketcap level with gold which when divided by 11 million bitcoins is approximately $600,000 per coin.
You are looking at a Ferrari and acting surprised the metal in the car is being valued at $1000 instead of $100.
Its a Ferrari. Its a alternative to friggin gold with many better qualities!

Women know a patsy and usually don't like to stick with one. Women either consciously or unconsciously typically always prefer  a slightly (not extremely) dominant male.
The girls that do stick with a patsy typically are the really bad ones that are almost professional users.
TL,DR. being too defering to women causes them not to want to pair up with you because they know you will defer to everyone else in life also and wind up losing. Sticking up for yourself is attractive to women.

DO talk with a tax consultant before sellin all you intend to liquidate.
I am no tax expert but i beleive if you sell and recognize you gains they will all be taxable. even $500,000 is a TON to be taxed  on.
They may suggest transferring some bitcoin into your roth ira before cashing it out if you can do so at your purchase price.
Mitt romney (according to an analysis of his tax returns I read during the elction period) put his stock into his roth IRA at purchase price (way undervalued) up to his 20,000 limit and then cashed it out at true value which is how he ended up with 20,000,000 or something in his Roth IRA tax free when you are only supposed to be able to deposit $20,000 per year.

It just logic. What other alternative investment has the attributes of bitcoin and is widely accepted and traded around the world in multiple exchanges that you can't make any more of (beyond 21 million).
what other investment can be bought without brokers, used like cash to buy stuff, is easier to transport than gold and easier to keep secretly?
Why do investors buy gold?

 Like in two days from now?
The real thing to start talking about now is how bitcoin probably will stop having the ideas of peaks and valleys that it had when so few were buying and using it.
Now support is around the world and  a few gamers who suddenly can't beleive they have over z thousand dollars can't crash the price by selling.
That doesn't mean ther won't be temporary slowdowns and some retrenchments but until bitcoin market cap reaches gold market cap which is around $600,000 / bitcoin at the current 11 million bitcoins we are likley to see a continued steadily increasing price that is as inevitable as water flowing to an empty pool.
Bitcoin is a barely filled pool capable of holding wealth and all around it are HUGE ENORMOUS tanks of water seeking alternative investment options.

what Os are you using?
you know it gets harder and harder to make the os do a real search for ALL files in later Os's.
You might boot off something like puppy linux and have it mount and do a searhc of your whole hard drive becuase puppy linux defaults to full access root. and can read all formats of hard disks no matte rthe OS I think.
Hell I am even havign a hard time getting my linux search window to find stuff until I remembered to SUDO in terminal first.
But with backups if you just did a manual copy you may not have copied over a copy of the hidden file.
best to look on the original hard disk which if you imaged it should still have it.

Just as a general rule.
Don't store all your private addresses in the same place. If stolen someone has all your money.
Print a few on different sheet s or simply cut bulk printouts in half or quarters.
Always have copies of your private keys in more than one place.
If you have a fire you don't want everything lost.
Don't store all your private keys In your phone. If your phone is lost someone has all your money.
Store one or two private keys and if you want to track all your money you can load the public keys but why let people know you have those other keys?
You don t need to remmeber which private key goes with the public keys.  Importing a private key into any wallet program regenerates the same public key.
Hope that helps..
Also instead of storing your Bitcoin addresses in text files which are easily scanned by virus Trojans why not store screencaptures of your QR codes   in jpg files. Much harder to Trojan scan .   You can even take photos of qr codes with a camera  that never connects to  a computer. Then no Trojan or virus can ever scan that jpg on the camera. Just don't let the wife "throw out that old camera you never use anymore".
Most importantly
The two number one ways people lose their money is by 
storing coins on online wallets with companies that go out of business
by encrypting their private keys with extra passwords and then forgetting the passwords. You have a much higher chance of forgeting your password than having a theif come into your home and find all your hidden addresses if you split them up. So then you have to print copies of your passwords. So then what is the use of passwordsfor your printed addresses?

Let's just remember that even if every single company in china stopped accepting Bitcoin as a purchasing option it would make no difference because Bitcoin has not grown based on being currency dispite the utopian dreams of some associated with it who really want to be able to buy pizza with their Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has grwon based on people wanting a digital alternative store of wealth - gold 2.0.
And as a digital replacement for gold there is still 600X upside before Bitcoin reaching market parity with Gold. tha'ts $600,000 per Bitcoin.
Baidu has not ever had a gnat's ass worth of their purchases be in Bitcoin and neither has any other retailer.
Baidu just started accepting Bitcoin a month or two ago.
Remember China has FIRMLY COME OUT and declared Bitcoin is LEGAL AS A COMMODITY LIKE GOLD.
I know some people want to be able to buy their internet or pizza or lollipops with their bitcoin but that isn't and never has been the primary reason people are buying Bitcoin.
People are buying it because it is a shelter and safety and transportable and secure and mostly private means to store their wealth across country borders without banks.
You can still always go buy and sell your Bitcoin from reall people on the street at localbitocins.com and then buy your pizza.
And again China has CLEARLY and DEFINITELY said it is LEGAL for people to buy and sell Bitcoin .
There is NO dispute about that.
I suspect Baidu is halting bitcoin payment until they get some clarification after the notice precisely because it matters so little to their bottom line . As soon as they get a little more certainty after the recent announcement by China they will probably put it back. Hell Baidu probalby has been reading the wrong stuff posted on r/Bitcoin and got worried they might be doing something wrong they said why risk it and took it down.

you are not quoting from the translation of the notice.
you are quoting from the SUMMARY which is not as accurate and why you are wrong.
THIS is the ACTUAL TRANSLATION OF THE ACTUAL NOTICE:
"Below is the Notice
People's Bank of China
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
China Banking Regulatory Commission
China Securities Regulatory Commission
China Insurance Regulatory Commission
Notice on preventing Bitcoin risk
Recently, a so-called Bitcoin calculated using certain computer programs gained widespread worldwide attention, there are also organizations and persons in China taking this opportunity to promote Bitcoin and related products. In order to protect the public's property rights, to protect RMB's official currency status, to prevent money laundering risk and to protect financial stability, according to the People's Bank Act, the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the Commercial Bank Act, Telecommunications Regulations etc, the following notice is made:
1 Correct knowledge of Bitcoin
Bitcoin has four main characteristics: no central issuer, limited quantity, no geographical limits and anonymity. Although it is called currency, it is not issued by a monetary authority, it does not have the status of legal tender and obliged payment status of currency, it is not currency in the true sense. Bitcoin is a specified virtual commodity, it does not have equal legal status with currency, and it cannot and should not be circulated as currency on the market.
(so 1. It doesnt have LEGAL status as an official currency issued by the state becuase it is not and so it shouldn't be CALLED a currency. you can however trade and exchange thiongs for it without restirction as long as you aren't laundering money. That's like saying you can't call a Bitcoin a USD dollar because it isn't. THe government doesn't back it. None the less it is compleletely legal to buy sell or hold or exchang ethings for it.  You can exchange stuff for it. it is legal to do that and buy and sell it and hold it. just like you can trade a can of beans for an ounce of gold. you just CAN'T SAY ITS OFFICIAL CHINESE CURRENCY BECAUSE IT ISNT. THAT 'S ALL)
2 Financial institutions and payment institutions must not start Bitcoin related business
At this stage, all ****financial institutions and payment institutions****(only emphasis added - othe rbusinesses can do as they like) must not use Bitcoin to set price for product or services, not buy or sell Bitcoins, not act as a market maker for Bitcoins, not underwrite insurance related to Bitcoin or cover Bitcoin in insurance, not directly or indirectly provide other Bitcoin related services, including registering, trading, clearing, settlement; not accept Bitcoin or use Bitcoin as payment tool; not start a Bitcoin and RMB or foreign currency exchange; not start a Bitcoin saving, trust or mortgage service; not issue Bitcoin related financial services; not use Bitcoin as the investment in trusts or funds.
(so in other words banks stay out of bitcoin and don't manipulate it and play any of your corner the market games with it or charge customers fees for it.)
3 Strengthening regulation of Bitcoin websites
According to the Telecommunications Act and the Regulation on Internet Information Service, websites that provide Bitcoin services like registration, trading etc should register with the telecommunications regulation authorities.
The telecommunications regulation authorities, following the determinations and punishment opinions of the relevant management authorities, should close down illegal Bitcoin sites according to law.
(register your websites - about as minimal a requirement as they could have given)
4 Prevent possible Bitcoin money laundering risk
Branches of the People's Bank should closely monitor the trends and activities Bitcoin and other similar virtual commodities with the characteristics of anonymity and easy cross-border access, seriously consider its money laundering risk, research and implement targeted preventative measures. The branches should include lawfully established organizations that provide Bitcoin registration or exchange services in its area into its anti-money laundering monitoring, and supervise them to strengthen their anti-money laundering monitoring.
Bitcoin websites should earnestly carry out their anti-money laundering duty, confirm the identities of their users, have them register using their real names, and register their name and ID card number. If financial institutions, payment institutions or Bitcoin websites discover suspicious transactions involving Bitcoin or other virtual commodities, they should immediately report it to the China Anti-Money Laundering Monitoring and Analysis Center, and cooperate with the People's Bank's investigation; if they find evidence of fraud, gambling, money laundering using Bitcoins, they should report it to the police.
(don't launder money with Bitcoin. track people and report those who look suspiciously like they ARE laundering money with btcoin. everyone else - you are ok to do as you like with Bitcoin- its official- bitcoin is fully legal.)
5 Strengthening public education on money knowledge and investment risk
Departments, financial organizations and payment organizations should in their daily tasks teach the public the correct concept of currency, to emphasize on public education about currency, and to add to public financial knowledge education the contents of correct knowledge of currency, correct views of virtual goods and virtual currency, rational investment, control of investment risk and defending one's financial safety, in order the public have correct views on currency and investing.
(educate people so they aren't deceived. duh)
Financial monitoring authorities can set implementation details according to this notice
Would the People's Bank branches please distribute this Notice to financial organizations and payment organizations in their area. Any new situations or questions arising from this notice please report promptly to the People's Bank."

How is it that if you buy bitoins and keep the private keys pivate that anyone has stolen anything from you?
And if you didn't do that, then you didn' t buy bitcoin. You participated in some other weird scheme that was not bitcoin.
Its like saying you got ruined by owning gold when you never actually owned gold in your house. You just owned a piece of paper that someone told you meant that you owned gold.
If you buy bitcoin regulary in increments and hold the addresses personally and only you know the private keys then you own bitcoin. If you don' t, then you dont own bitcoin.

my thought is buy some of those packs of desiccant at the dollar store. put some in a cloth pouch inside a big freezer bag with the drive for awhile.
put the drive inside a portable drive bay with long usb cable.. leave the cable sticking out of the freezer bag.
after some time for the dessicant to work put the whole thing inside the freezer WITH THE USB CORD STICKING OUT THE DOOR.
let it cool down.
hook up a laptop to the drive still in the freezer.
see if it works.
keeping it in the freezer keeps it from warming up as you fire it up.
so it might stay functioning long enough to backup the whole drive.
what do you think?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:05:47
Private message me where you are if you have some to sell.

First, the nodes don't have hardcoded trusted nodes.  There are DNS seeds that can be used when a new node is bootstrapping and needs a way to find running nodes to connect to.
Each block is composed of a header and a list of transactions.  The transactions are hashed together in a Merkle Tree and the root of that tree is included in the header in such a way that none of the transactions can be changed without changing the hash in the header.  The header also includes the hash of the previous header, proving that it came after the previous block, and also ensuring that the previous block can't be changed without changing the current header.
The nonce field is allowed to be anything at all, provided that it leads to a valid hash.  This means that each miner iterates through all 232 possible nonces for the block candidate they are working on hoping that one of them works out.  If none works, they ask for a new candidate, which means changing the timestamp or Merkle root hash.  Changing the Merkle root means that at least one transaction needs to change (or a new transaction can be added).  The generate transaction is allowed to contain arbitrary data, giving nodes the ability to generate new trees as needed.
The header is then fed into hash=SHA256(SHA256(header)).  SHA256 is expected to have essentially a random distribution, meaning that the output is similar to getting a random number.  The network tracks a target value, and only accepts blocks that are less than the target.  There is no way to design a block header in advance that will have a hash that is below the target value, so miners have to check each one hoping to get lucky.  The current target gives each hash about a 1 in 15 quadrillion chance of being below the target, so miners are checking (in aggregate) about 25 trillion hashes per second.
When a new block is found, every transaction is checked to make sure it is well formed and valid, and that each redeemed output is valid and not previously spent.  The Merkle tree is created and checked to make sure that it matches the root hash in the header.  The timestamp is checked to make sure it is within the allowable range, the difficulty is checked to make sure it agrees with the network, and the header hash is checked to make sure it is below the target value.  If all of the checks are true, and the previous block hash in the header belongs to the block that was the previously highest block, the chain is extended.
When doing the initial download, some checks are abbreviated or skipped on old blocks, but the 2500 most recent blocks always get full verification.

Start with the header.  It is described in that link I posted.  Be careful of endianness issues.  Once you get to the point where you can build a header and get the same hash that the rest of the network sees, you can move on to parsing the block body, which is fairly simple, and hashing the transactions to build the Merkle Tree.
Then you can start building a database of transaction outputs and checking that transaction inputs are valid.  The final step will be checking the signatures in the transactions.  The signatures themselves aren't too bad, but first you need to prepare it in a specific way.
 VI pops up in a lot of places, you'll need to know how to read it to do anything
 this map helps you parse transactions.
 list of opcodes, needed for parsing scripts
 this map is for preparing transactions for signing
 description of the signing process
 format of the block files, essentially a dump of the block messages minus the command string, also the magic and the blocksize aren't part of the block proper.

stuff in orange on the right is how many coins availble to be sold at the price along the bottom line. so more coins are available for sale as the price goes up to the right along the bottom line.
stuff in green on the left is the numbers of coins people are willing to buy based on the price again along the bottom line.
where they meet in the middle is the current trade.
so cleary you see there is almost a wall where very few people are willing to sell bitcoin at less than what appears to be $120 or so.

Uhh why would anyone "freak out"? the Chinese announcement is incredibly good.
Bitcoin is legal and is like gold (Officially from the Chinese governemtn)
and the Chinese governement is going to prevent the banksters from corrupting it and trying to take it over and speculating in it with the people's money when the people can buy it themselves without the bankers charging them fees.
It both legitimizes Bitcoin once and for all in China as legal for people and businesses to do with what they will AND it blockades banks from screwing it all up.

If you read the story they were apparently duped into accepting the NSA's version of some software because RSA's software engineers were told it was better than what they had and was going to be the US government standard so would need to be used on any software sold to the US government.
Because RSA had lost so many of it's original top engineers when they moved from the West coast to The East Coast (lesson for other software companies?) they didn't have the in house expertise (or possibly the fighting spirit? - more lessons on moving from west to east?) to reject the NSA's software.

someone else seems to agree with my interpretation:
"However, the central bank said the **public was free to take part in internet transactions** provided they take on the risk themselves. **Internet companies serving as trading platforms should ask clients to register** with information including their name and identity card number, it said.
(edit me: so obviously both trading AND transactions ARE permitted)
Bitcoin exchanges may be forced to inform authorities about sizeable or suspicious transactions, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources."
"The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said no financial institutions, payment agencies or insurers should price products and services in bitcoin, nor are they allowed to trade or provide bitcoin exchange or settlement services. "

I hope others will join me in requesting to the mods that a new rule be established that posts can't simply claim a crash is coming without supporting such a post with more  than a claim that it is high so it must fall.
We all want all analysis both good and bad but shouting fire in a theater repeatedly can cause a stampede and we need to start requiring evidence of fire and smoke before allowing such posts 
Also those with patterns of posting nothing but  a " crash is coming" and" Bitcoin sucks" really don't belong here.
There was a huge effort for the past several days before yesterday's panic to post negative comments like crash etc to clearly try to scare new adopters. I think it unfortunately worked.
I also think several of those posters used separate accounts  to do it.
A sidebar rule saying no posting of impending crash claims or "bitcoin has no value " without analysis in the same comment that supports this with recent new data and not just claims of "its gone up so must good down"
Some help here?
Not seeking a ban of negative analysis - just  requirement that there BE some analysis .

the interesting thing about this is if you had burned this onto a usb or cd to boot from you would not find old coins by looking for wallet.dat. 
you would have to reboot from the old cdrom
I used to try every distro that i could find.
so now I need to scan and see if I ever downloaded linuxcoin.iso
If I did I might have run it for a while...

Absolutely wrong.
Bitcoin done right means you dont need to trust anyone.
You transfer your bitcoins to several addresses that only you know the private keys to and that are not loaded into wallets (only the receive address is used in wallet trsnsfers, not the private keys.)
You  only load the private key into a wallet program one at  time to spendbsome.
You dont need to trust anyone.
That is what bitcoin is. Anything else is not bitcoin.
Wallets are not bitcoin.
Only the bitcoin addresses and private keys are bitcoin.
Anything els bis layers on the s ystem that can more easily be hacked and stolen and they are not bitcoin.
Its like cash is different than a safe. When you have cash in your hand then youvown it.
when you put it ina safe in your window (like a wallet program)  then if the ssfe is madebof glass someone might steal your cash. Itf it is made of steel there is less chance but still more chance than if you kep your cash location secret (you never load yur private keys into anything)

Be calm.
Do not predict the destruction of the dollar.
Respond that bitcoin is NOT volitile but has sustained steady monthly growth for over  4 years now with less downturns than Gold or the dollar or Facebook stock.
Say more vendors accept bitcoin every day and often give bitcoin buyers discounts.
Bitcoin is not complicated like gold subsurface mining or wall street curency derivatives. Bitcoin can be a free app on your phone.
You can   ow buy lamborghinis and pizza and houses and plane flights and even trips to space on Virgin Galatic with bitcoin. A police chief is now getti g paid I. Bitcoins.
They WILL SAY They are "volitilex or "risky".
Respond above.
They WILL say they are complicated. Say they are less complicated than your bank statement.
They WILL try to paint you as a nut. .
Say "i wish I had a tinfoil hat that could catch bitcoins!". Unfortunately they are too valuable!
They WILL SAY they have "no intrinsic value like gold or money"
Say "i can buy an ounce of gold with one bitcoin but how could I pay for a pizza that was $7.99 with gold and get cha get change?"
Be calm.  Don't be too excited. Wear very conservative clothes. 
They will run the clip where you look goofy or make a mistake so give them as few chances as possible.
They will also HAVE THE CAMERA RUNNING ALL THE TIME before you sit down or whatever. Anything goofy you say or any nervous laughter between you that they capture they will edit in Ronald you look nervous about bitcoin.
Keep answers short.
Smile always.
Remember it is the local news editors dream to edit a price that has some humor or looks forboding.
They will fake and scramble footage to make this happen when it didn't.
Local. News is the worst about this becuase they do t know better.
Demand permission before allowing full netwrok national usage. Pre authorize ONLY LOCAL USE UNTIL YOU CAN SEE THE STORY IN FINAL EDIT. They might edit it right In The news van which is typical so look at it there.
Oh yeah. They WILL SAY "it has risen so fast . It must be a bubble".
 Say well I keep waiting for the fast adopters of email and cellphones to stop using them too becuase their adoption curve was faster but people seem to still find email and cellphones useful and will find bitcoin useful in 10 more years too.
Edit: they wil say "the illegal operation silk road used them for drugs and stuff!!! Have you used the m for drugs?

A temporary price peak is not what the average person thinks of when they hear the term bubble.

Of course not. Only a percentage of total world wealth estimated at about 200 trillion dollars plus a percentage of all transactions which is trillions plus a percentage of the exponential growth in world wealth that will be caused by bitcoin itself just as the internet spawned exponential growth in world wealth.
Whereever that is it is much higher than $600,000 /bitcoin.

The short term reasons for rallies make no difference.
Fundamentally bitcoin is an important international exchange and hold currency and must equalize at a rate that makes sense for a limited supply of 21 million coins compared to trillions in other currencies.
I think of it. As "what if there were 21 million ounces of gold, what would the price be?"

All the capital doesn't have to flow into it.
They just have to bid it up as they put some in.
The value comes from not everyone BEING IN but people or funds WANTING TO BE IN at a LEVEL.
They will continue to buy in as they can at $600,000 bitcoin.
At that point the billions they got in at $10,000 provide them the returns they edited when it becomes valued at $600,000.
Exotic Ferraris aren't $3,000,000 because everyone has one. They are $3,000,000 because the people who have the money want a few.

First I hate my autocorrect. Excuse the word mangling.
Here is the issue.
I beleive there is a legal definition and licensing in chins for what THEY call a payment service.
I Thu k you then use the term payment service to describe something that bitpay does which is not the officially licensed and used payment service term used by chiese authorities.
I may be wrong but that is what I think.
They are trying to keep official definitions and ljcenssees in finacial areas clear to jnknowledgsble consumers who might otherwise be milead. That is what the whole title and I tent of this notice is so that fits.
Its like payday Loan Companies in the USA. They require license and it would be bad if suddenly they started using $signs I. Front of numbers that really represented bitcoins not dollars becuase consumers could be confused about what they are getting.
I beleive what the Chinese are saying to extend the analygy is that if you are a licensed paydayloan co.pant you can't get I cocked in bitcoin. You stuff must be in dollars only to prevent confusion.
If however you want to be a similar thing but operate in bitcoin you can't get s lice se or call yourself a paydayloan company and you must clealry state that you are operating in bitcoins and never make it seem or loom or be called dollars.
That's my tskke. And it fits with the whole I tention of the notice and the eclafed legality of all bitcoin use as long as it isn't confusing or illegal or done by licensed financial operators who they hold to a higher standard.

One thought though. Remember the reason gold is used in jewelry is becuase it is thought of as valuable. It wouldn't be used otherwise. Why don't women paint Aluminum rings with gold paint and wear them? Becuase aluminum isn't valued at 1200 an ounce and and people wear real gold jewelry to show their wealth. So REALLY the gold put in jewelry is also for wealth so that's 90% for wealth and only 10% for industry.

Now of course as soon as wealthy people start to dump money into bitcoin there will be more early adopter Bitcoin millionaires and billionaires made.
The wealthy buying in will cause the exact situation of wealth redistribution that you have mentioned. I think the possibilities are huge. It's also important to note that it might also devalue some other holdings the wealthy are in and if they don't get out they may lose position in that way too.
I don't know of any other thing with no barrier to entry for poor people that has such a possibility of changing their wealth.
Even if lots of people make only 30,000 in savings from bitcoin increases that would be a HUGE shift in wealth for many people. Most people have NO savings.

"Look at my top posts from all time to see these changes.. And even those are now censored. My real top post was a top ten post of all time in Reddit a d exposed how health insurance companies canceled almost everyone once their expenses were greater than possible future revenues.
that post doesn't even show up in my top of all time anymore and it had something like 10,000 net Upvoted. It ranked just below " obame elected president"
and I have been banned from r/politics for about two years even though I consistently had top post s there including the second post listed In my censored top post list linked below.
go figure.
be sure to select "of all time " when visiting the link below.

 Tapping Social Networking Sites To Energize B2B Buyers June 23, 2009 — Laura Ramos
 Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great ways to build their brand image. According to Jody Nimetz, author of Marketing Jive[32], there are five major uses for businesses and social media: to create brand awareness, *as an online reputation management tool *, for recruiting, to learn about new technologies and competitors, and as a lead gen tool to intercept potential prospects.[32]. These companies are able to drive traffic to their own online sites while encouraging their consumers and clients to have discussions on how to improve or change products or services.

"Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) isn't the first politician to use Reddit, but the sweet spot he found on the site on Tuesday provides an interesting case study for other elected officials.
McGovern's staff posted a link to the video below on the social networking site of him introducing legislation to overturn Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that allowed corporations to make unlimited political donations. Within a few hours, the post accumulated more than 3,000 "up-votes," pushing it to the top spot on the site." McGovern's staff has been posting under his direction on Reddit for more than a year.

"The risks of a Reddit PR strategy…
A highly placed news story on Reddit is very valuable to other media companies because it brings a huge pageview payoff. It's also valuable for PR and marketing firms hired to promote client news. But Reddit is unspammable and even a whiff of manipulation can blacklist a publication or organization.
Recently, Quickmeme.com was banned following revelations of vote manipulation. It was reportedly earning as much as $2 million per month from manipulating Reddit traffic. And The Atlantic has been blacklisted for attempts at promoting stories.
Although Reddit can't directly distinguish between sourced stories whose content might have been promoted or corrupted by PR agencies, the community can question those stories and their information. A high rank for a story on Reddit might be because the content of the story is suspect, creating a large discussion group. Which is not always a good thing depending on whose interests are at stake."

By Grant Robertson (Google+) on June 23, 2013 Email
Fernando Alfonso III contributed to this report.
Quickmeme, the image-captioning site used by millions of Reddit users to share photos, has been banned from the social news site.
Reddit moderators and administrators have determined that Quickmeme has engaged in vote manipulation to drive traffic to its site.
The site-wide ban was announced early Sunday morning on Reddit's r/AdviceAnimals, a default forum with more than 2.6 million readers who have helped proliferate, and foster, the Internet's most popular memes—including Grumpy Cat, Overly Attached Girlfriend, and Scumbag Steve. (The people behind these memes have achieved significant financial success thanks to their Reddit popularity and have even landed movies, promotional deals, and commercials.) "

"Reddit is the 800 pound Gorilla in the room and has been for years. No one talks about the powerful and direct influence that this quirky, impenetrable, and oddly still-underground this social sharing site is. While people are writing post-after-post about Pinterest, So.cl, Google+, Facebook, Instamatic, and Twitter, reddit’s eating everyone’s lunch – at least when it comes to authentic bottom-up self-organization.
One reason why I don’t ever discuss it when I am discussing social media marketing and PR is because I just can’t get my foot in the door. I have been submitting links since before it had corporate owners and the only up-votes I have ever garnered have been forced, never organic. None of my pieces have ever resulted in a fire storm. If you look at my submissions, you’ll see ones and twos – I have pretty much given up. And this is part of the reason why I believe we in marketing and PR ignore it."

You are missing the point.
There is very little alternative investment that has the reasonable potetnial to be many multiples of  what it is now and less chance to go lower.
Those opportunities just don't come around that often.
Bitcoin has FUNDAMENTAL ADVANTAGES over alternatives  just like the fax over mail and the internet over the library.
Therefore it is brand new and has fundamental advantages over alternatives and reasonable reasons to go to multiples of its worth because it is not yet widely adopted.
So no matter how many multiples it gains it is far better than alternatives available.
It may or may not make someone 1000x or 100000x but even if it makes 100x that's HUGE.
But there are very reasonable comparisions to the gold capital markets that suggested $600,000 per Bitcoin is reasonable. (Specifically the gold Market is valued at $7,739,496,400,000 at the current $1,200 pper ounce. Bitcoin will be a similar investment alternative sink for money/wealth therefore if the same allocation of the  World's wealth goes to Bitcoin (which is reasonable to assume) one Bitcoin would be equal to $600,000)

I have no problem with people who have contrary opinions.
We all want to learn things quickly and thats why we come here. 
Someone taught me something about technical analysis yesterday that perdicted a price downturn that was good to know even though I don't beleive it can make long range predictions and I don't beleive in daytrading. (I believe in the long term place bitcoin will have in the financial future and from that comes it's probable future value which is why i have some.)
However it is wrong for people to come and intentionally post misleading titles and continue to post them even when they are presented with clear evidence that contradicts their posts (like "bitcoin made illegal in china!") over and over.
They are simply trying to manipulate the price for their own purposes and people should know that.

I feel the same way. bitcoin will not topple the dollar but be used side by side like how gold coins are.
China and Russia are going to stop stockpiling the US dollar. 
Russia wants to be completely rid of the currency by 2017. 
China right now imports more oil than America and is currently setting up to price oil in Yuan. 
Look up BRIC, Brazil Russia, India and China. They plan on taking their ball and not letting us play with it. They will take billions out of our economy. And some say by 2027 they could be doing more business than the G7 countries. 
China has kept the Yuan artificially low for a long time. As soon as they demand to buy oil in Yuan and force oil exporters to sell oil in Yuan, they will hike up the value, the oil exporters will see their Yuan purchasing power increase tremendously and America will look like a joke until we start bombing Arabs for betraying us.
China is already swinging their big dicks around, and we American's are swinging our right back hoping to intimidate the chinese with our large african american dongs. Case in point:
oh yeah bitches??

You transfer your bitcoins to addresses you create and only you know the private keys for.
That and only that is owning your bitcoins.
when you want to spend some you load one of the private keys into your favorite wallet program and spend from one and only one address.

"it will crash by maybe 30% and you can own that many more thousands of dollar bitcoins in the future."
At the rise rate today if you are wrong you lose a lot more future bitcoins than you can gain if you are right.
If you had say waited out the last few days hoping t would fall 30% you would have lost half your future bitcoins for a possible speculation that you might get 1/3 more IF it crashed.
Besides it is much harder to crash now because we have exchanges all over the world. new money is comingin to it from all over the world.
The big boys are just getting in.
The big money spigots are just now turning on.
If you beleive in bitcoin as a currency and/or wealth allocation choice (and I do) that will be recognized more and more by the  world then the thing to do is put any extra non essential money you have into it when ever you get that money. Don't watch the dialy price. Just keep buying when you reasonably can. when the headline say it has reached the market cap of gold then start thinking about some reallocation to conserve risk ($600,000 per bitcoin)
Of course you should cash out small portions along the way as those small portions reachmilesotnes that woudl drastically change your life without losing the majority of your bitcoin investment but that totoally depends on when you got in.
someone who never had anything and who could sell 1/10 of their holdings for $50,000 in cash   to payoff a house or all debts which would be life changing then might be wise to sell that portion only.
When it gets to another milestone  then again may be take out a portion again.
Let's face it if we really beleive in this then we have to beleive it will challenge the marketcap of gold at least.
It has more advantages than gold therefore it should see the same marketcap or better.
but along the way a person needs to lock in those changes that will permanently change his life just in case, and still hang on to whatever he wants to have when it hits $600,000.
That's my philosopy anyway. but I wasn't in early enough so It will be a while before I start hitting those portional value milestones.

Yes, seeing now three days later that the latest retrenchment only went down 20% percent or so ($380 to $310) and completely recovered in less than 24 hrs to $380 ish today already I am actually thinking the depth of international investment and spread of investment exchanges may have permanently stopped the previous 2 month crashes potential like we saw 6 months ago.
With it at $380 for over 3 days and having completely resisted a retrenchment even during a dive of a few hours I am thinking we might be above $1000 in a month.
The new level of "established" interests in the "official" financial world  that exists now that didnt exist 6 months ago may just make the tipping point hit very very soon - like30 or 60 days.
Witht he kind of flood of money and the self reinforcing rises and rush to get in I think it just might really really pop and now it's only one and a half more double to get over $1000!

I think it is easy to casue a panic in bitcoin.
Too many buyers are crazy technical speculators who literally can't hold on for two days.
If this flushes them out and leaves only the sensible long term people who understand what bitcoin is going to be long term ,, swell maybe that is good for the market.
No person who sensibly bought into bitcoin for the right reasons needs to sell in any one of these vibrations.
Just like in may . Hang on and the inevitable push as a repository for wealth that competes favorably with gold will evetually drive the value dramatically high.

the "correction" that is occuring is the vast shift of assets from worthless seizable infltable currencies to a limted scarce uninflatable currency.  the correction has just begun and is likely headed way up.
when you have all your eggs in one basket and then suddenly someone shows you a neew basket that is stronger and only a few people have some eggs in, do you think the level of eggs in the new basket will rise or fall?
it will rise until most people who invest have at least SOME of their eggs in the new basket.
if just 2.5 % off all eggs end up in the new basket one bitcoin equals $700,000 US.

of course. however except for google and amazon and alta vista (which was bought out remember for a handsome sum and didnt "die" or fail)  those other things weren't fundemental shifts - simply implementation of common business models over the internet.
google was a fundamentally different search engine using page rank that fundementally shifted search,
amazon was a internet sales company that built its own nationwide warehousing infrastructure which permanently lowered its costs compared to competitors.
alta vista was a fundamentally different search engine that used text parsing to discover new relevant search results compared to yahoo at the time which relied on humns to link and categorize their favorite pages. It dominanted for years until google.
bitcoin fundamentally changes the characteristic of a currency by basing its production on math , AND changes transference by encoding trascations in an relativeley unassailable transaction verification system.
It is a FUNDEMENTAL shift breakthrough in money and payment.
It is not just a copycat dotcom like so many that failed.

I downloaded a client in 2011.
Probably heard about it on reddit.
Recently looked through all my old computers and it seems I never ran it. (found the old bitcoin windows client from 2011 but no wallet.dat files or unzipped files) 
Trying to remember why but my guess was it was probably requiring more powerful computers by that time.
I am surprised I didn't hear about it sooner . I probably would have run it for a week and forgotten about it if I had heard about it in 2009  when it took no cpu to make coins becuase I always run novel new software just to see how it works.
I actually was expecting to find some old wallet on old backups but nothing. Argh. Really surprised at that.
And someone here said in the early days you could mine 10 coins an hour with a regular pc in 2009.
Double damn . :-)
I am sort of surprised I did not adopt it earlier or hear about it earlier. 
So I bought some in the last few months.
I'll tell you one thing. When I heard about it this year again I absolutely positively understood the magnitude of what bitcoin was and why it would attract capital and come to have a huge place in world finance.
I feel more certain about bitcoin naturally equally the whole gold capitalization ATLEAST and perhaps going further than I have felt since I positively knew the housing market would crash in 2008ish  or Google would dominate world search the first time I tried it when they were still testng their graphicsless  web page online the first month.
 (i first used Google when altavista was the top engine and INSTANTLY I understood Google would take over. told everyone I worked with and no one thought it was possible ALta Vista would be toppled - Yahoo had already been toppled .)
So I have seen things like Bitcoin is shifting the world beofre and know what kind of superiority in function makes those things happen.
Its like that with bitcoin.
EDIT: Actually just did some digging on slashdot.org and saw their first stories and I now bet I first heard about it when Wikileaks got shut out of mastercard and visa and they  made an announcement you could give them money by Bitcoin. Didn't do it though apparently because I don't think I ever even ran the client becuase I can't fidnd old wallet.dat anywhere (DAMN) but the story timing matches my download and I'll bet that's when I download the client.. Here are the first slashdot.org stories
I think now if I had studied Bitcoin more in 2011 and not just thought of it as a way to pay Wikileaks or someone I would have gotten into it in 2011.
Edit2: Sort of fascinated by why I didn't take action sooner and so researched my first post about bitcoin.
It was 1 year ago(wish reddit kept better long term dates) : It related to Max Keiser and I remember watching theshow where he clearly explained what would happen to Fiat and GOld and he is the best and most honest analyst I know. 
10.01.2012 03:00 21 comments Episode 234 ­Every week Max Keiser looks at all the scandal behind the financial news headlines. In this episode, Max Keiser and co-host, Stacy Herbert, discuss copyright and how Hollywood cons Congress by using Wall Street accounting. In the second half of the show, Max talks to Amir Taaki about hackers, piracy, technology and bitcoin.
I remember watching the show mentioned in my text too.
I remember now why I waited so long to actually buy some. ...I had to get free of some other things and people who were well intentioned wonderful distractions from my concentration and make some big life changes now that I think about it. Then I moved on Bitcoin. wish I had in 2011. But still if I had run that bitcoin client I downloaded in 2011 I am sure I would have been hooked. 
I have seen 3 huge world financial moves in my life. 1990 Real Estate boom bust, 1990's internet boom which never busted (no smart person got caught by the stupid stuff that busted like the Sock puppet dog- you had to recognize things that really changed theway people did something by enabling them with more control and convenience like email, amazon, google, email, youtube, bittorrent) ; the 2000-2008 easy money fueled real estate boom and obviously coming bust,
And now bitcoin wil be the fourth world game changer.
Bitcoin won't bust just like gogole didnt bust because Bitcoin allows everyone to universally PERSONALLY control, protect, manage and spend their wealth and money better and less expensively than anything before it.
when ANY product has those things going for it in a field that is universal ( and money is the most universal) you can be SURE it will be widely adopted.
The real estate busts and the few very visible dot com busts came because they were fueled not by the changed value in the properties - their utuility hadnt changed or been made better from what was there before. Buying the same dog food wasn't better over theinternet than at the store. Finding a book you couldn't FIND much less GET anywere else for less money like Amazon WAS better.
 
The boom busts were caused by non accountable speculation caused by buyers being given free money to speculate.
NO one is giving people free money to speculate in bitcoin like banks handed out mortgages.
That's one reason you know Bitocin's success isn't a bubble mentality . It's people's own real moeny they are putting in and they are doing it because they can see bitcoin does something far better that what existed before.
Bitcoin is better money and wealth. There is no doubt about it and there is a universal need for better money and more secure self control of wealth.
That's why it shoudl at least supercede the market cap of gold and payment systems like paypal and visa master card system. AT LEAST.
That's $600,000/bitcoin and MORE.

Really the most important developments are the announcements by wall street that they are going to invest hundreds of millions in bitcoin next year.
Its really the final step in valuation.
The technical advancements by bitcoin have been discussed. Early adopters u derstood them and got in.
Recently the general public has gotten on board although I am not sure how many did for the right reasons and they panic easily.
The big money couldn't move that fast and frankly did t even u derstand it as little as 6 months ago. Now they all know and are lining up their own ways to get in.
The flood of big money is really the final part of valuation in the financial space.

Excuse me by tthis is a (ERRORONEOUS)  CONCLUSION Bobby Lee made which is clearly erroroneous based on the advisory from China.
Specifically China said anyone and any businesses except financial institutions can trade in Bitcoin as they wish.  They can exchange their goods and services for them as the wish. The advisory clearly says that.
The ONLY reference China made about the RMB being the official currency was that it said since the RMB is the ONLY OFFICIAL currency then people can only be forced legally to make debt s etc payable in the officially currency.
In other words no-one can be FORCED to accept or pay in Bitcoins .
It doesnt mean people can't legally use bitcoins.
Bobby Lee needs to apologize and retract this silly blunder.
Its just like in the  USA  if you owe a debt you can only be FORCED to pay it in us dollars. You can't be FORCED to pay in Bitcoin. It doesn't mean you can't pay in Bitcoin if both parties agree.
I can't beleive the audience would let him get away with such an amatuerish blunder.

It doesnt hve to be everyone on the planet.
it only has tro be 2.5 percent of total money under management and with returns like this there is no way money management professionals arent going to start investing in bitcoin.
They vertually have to - ESPECIALLY becuase f the EU money seizures in Cyprus.
remember only 5% or American own stocks and yet the stock values hold.
It only takes a few traDES AT HIGHER NUMBER TO REVALUE THE WHOLE COMMODITY AND WITH MORE PEOPLE GETTING IN THAN OUT IT CANTR GO DOWN EASILY.
rEMEMBER THIS IS A fundemental EVALUATION NOT A SPECULATIVE ONE.
THERE IS A fundemental REASON FOR PEOPLE TO PUT SOME OF THEIR LIQUIDITY IN bITCOIN SINCE THE eu BANK ACCOUNT SEIZURES AND WITHDRAWAL LIMITS.

I said at $200 that bitcoin is going to equal the market cap of gold which makes a bitcoin equal to $600,000 / bitcoin.
I have said it through all recent flucutations.
That is still 1000x the current price.
If you can only buy $50 from someone on localbitcoin do it.
50x 1000 is still 50,000!
You are still ahead of most in your thinking.
Most are still not on board.
There is literally nothing you can POSSIBLE do as small investor that has anywhere NEAR the possibility bitcoin still has.
Even if to only rises 100 x you still will have a hidden 5000 than no one will no about .
It is not over.
I can't advise anyone to borrow to buy becuase you might need to hang on for a yr or two or three but personally I put every scrap I can into bitcoin.
It is a major evolution in the world of finance. As a small person you never get an equal chance to own before the final value. You are locked out of pre ipo's where the real money is made.
With bitcoin you actually still have the chance to buy BEFORE the big funds get in.
But that will only last until the next quarter when they will reallocate like crazy and then the big big 1000x possibilities will shrink to 100x or 10 x and a bitcoin will be 10,000.
Get in at least a little.

Main network genesis block
The block on Bitcoin Block Explorer
Here is a representation of the genesis block as it appeared in a comment in an old version of Bitcoin (line 1613). The first section defines exactly all of the variables necessary to recreate the block. The second section is the block in standard printblock format, which contains shortened versions of the data in the first section.
The coinbase parameter (seen above in hex) contains, along with the normal data, the following text[1]:
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks[2]"
This was probably intended as proof that the block was created on or after January 3rd, 2009, as well as a comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.
The first 50BTC block reward went to address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa, though this reward can't be spent due to a quirk in the way that the genesis block is expressed in the code (this may have been intentional). "

I am sorry but did you seriously expect china or any country to adopt bitcoin as their official currency? becuase they did everything BUT that with that statement yesterday.
Anyone can now  OFFICIALLY LEGALLY buy, sell, hold or trade Bitcoin it as long as they aren't an official China Licensed Currency institution.
anyone else can DO ANYTHING with Bitcoin except launder money.
Websites platforms can trade it.. anything.
They just have to use people's real names.
That's all.
Did you expect China to put a picture of Chairman Mao on an officially stamped Bitcoin?
Because you got the legalization of everything else.

I actually beleive that people will have more confidence to reinvest in bitcoin because time and time again Bitcoin doesn't disappear.
Now it shows that it simply will never go to zero and won't disappear like the scare mongers say so people will feel very comfortable buying more knowing they won't lose all their money.
Back when it was a nerd system and hadn't been tested people were more cautious.
They already know bitcoin isn't a bond that won't move.
They wouldn't like it if it was a bond.
To most people Bitocin is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something that could go very very big. (already has for people who got in sooner)

You are so new to Reddit maybe you honestly don't know.
the PR firms rampagin g through reddit have been documented and broken wide open over and over.
I guess I need to update the old evidence list I made years ago and this is as good a time as any:
here is a post that made it to the top or r/technology and r/ conspiracy before being removed by the mods this week.
you should read some of the coments and analysis from others.
you should also look at this to see the clear censorship that takes place on reddit.
if you are too lazy to click:
"Look at my top posts from all time to see these changes.. And even those are now censored. My real top post was a top ten post of all time in Reddit a d exposed how health insurance companies canceled almost everyone once their expenses were greater than possible future revenues.
that post doesn't even show up in my top of all time anymore and it had something like 10,000 net Upvoted. It ranked just below " obame elected president"
and I have been banned from r/politics for about two years even though I consistently had top post s there including the second post listed In my censored top post list linked below.
go figure.
be sure to select "of all time " when visiting the link below.
Now sees how e ven my top post of all time list has been censored to exclude my REAL top post of all time  this is my top ten link that has been censored from my all time top posts link! Look at the over 6000 vote count! It should be on the top of my all time top posts list!
Notice how even today this post should appear in the top post page of all time for ALL OF REDDIT but it does not.
It should rank with others who have 6000 or so net votes and it doesn't. see here.

 Tapping Social Networking Sites To Energize B2B Buyers June 23, 2009 — Laura Ramos
 Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great ways to build their brand image. According to Jody Nimetz, author of Marketing Jive[32], there are five major uses for businesses and social media: to create brand awareness, *as an online reputation management tool *, for recruiting, to learn about new technologies and competitors, and as a lead gen tool to intercept potential prospects.[32]. These companies are able to drive traffic to their own online sites while encouraging their consumers and clients to have discussions on how to improve or change products or services.

"Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) isn't the first politician to use Reddit, but the sweet spot he found on the site on Tuesday provides an interesting case study for other elected officials.
McGovern's staff posted a link to the video below on the social networking site of him introducing legislation to overturn Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that allowed corporations to make unlimited political donations. Within a few hours, the post accumulated more than 3,000 "up-votes," pushing it to the top spot on the site." McGovern's staff has been posting under his direction on Reddit for more than a year.

"The risks of a Reddit PR strategy…
A highly placed news story on Reddit is very valuable to other media companies because it brings a huge pageview payoff. It's also valuable for PR and marketing firms hired to promote client news. But Reddit is unspammable and even a whiff of manipulation can blacklist a publication or organization.
Recently, Quickmeme.com was banned following revelations of vote manipulation. It was reportedly earning as much as $2 million per month from manipulating Reddit traffic. And The Atlantic has been blacklisted for attempts at promoting stories.
Although Reddit can't directly distinguish between sourced stories whose content might have been promoted or corrupted by PR agencies, the community can question those stories and their information. A high rank for a story on Reddit might be because the content of the story is suspect, creating a large discussion group. Which is not always a good thing depending on whose interests are at stake."

By Grant Robertson (Google+) on June 23, 2013 Email
Fernando Alfonso III contributed to this report.
Quickmeme, the image-captioning site used by millions of Reddit users to share photos, has been banned from the social news site.
Reddit moderators and administrators have determined that Quickmeme has engaged in vote manipulation to drive traffic to its site.
The site-wide ban was announced early Sunday morning on Reddit's r/AdviceAnimals, a default forum with more than 2.6 million readers who have helped proliferate, and foster, the Internet's most popular memes—including Grumpy Cat, Overly Attached Girlfriend, and Scumbag Steve. (The people behind these memes have achieved significant financial success thanks to their Reddit popularity and have even landed movies, promotional deals, and commercials.) "

"Reddit is the 800 pound Gorilla in the room and has been for years. No one talks about the powerful and direct influence that this quirky, impenetrable, and oddly still-underground this social sharing site is. While people are writing post-after-post about Pinterest, So.cl, Google+, Facebook, Instamatic, and Twitter, reddit’s eating everyone’s lunch – at least when it comes to authentic bottom-up self-organization.
One reason why I don’t ever discuss it when I am discussing social media marketing and PR is because I just can’t get my foot in the door. I have been submitting links since before it had corporate owners and the only up-votes I have ever garnered have been forced, never organic. None of my pieces have ever resulted in a fire storm. If you look at my submissions, you’ll see ones and twos – I have pretty much given up. And this is part of the reason why I believe we in marketing and PR ignore it."

 I did a post on that a few days ago with almost exactly the same final price per Bitcoin.
That's what I think is logical to happen.
Remember Bitcoin doesn't have to erode the god market to do that. both Gold and bitcoin can retaint heir total marketcap at gold's market cap. they don't need to and probably won't divide that.
Lots and lots of people would like to put more money into gold but are scared of transport and storage or no real gold backing  gold receipts etc etc.
There is tons more money that CAN go into Bitcoin because there is none of that concern.
It think it will and eventually exceed the market cap of gold for that reason.
but mean time approx ~ $600,000 is my target.
The real question is how long will it take all the other big wealth pools to start draining a little into the big and 99% empty bitcoin reserve tank until bitcoin reaches gold's market cap?
That will be very interesting.
It literally could happen overnight if someone at a bg institution suddenly recognized "This is GOING to happen. We can diversify that portion of OUR holding into bitcoin NOW before that cap price is reached and then basically CAUSE the cap price to be reached after we own as much bitcoin as the  market can sell us.
i meanit literally could happen overnight if the exchanges could process that many transactions.
(this may in fact be what China is trying to do right now.)
Or it could slowly creep up over a a few years.
There has neever been any thign like this.
 It's almost like someone found another form of gold in the ground. People looked and realized that,yes, it is gold and has all the same wealth allocation diversification attritbutes and there are only 12 million out of the ground and only 21 million total. 
How fast would those 12 million on the ground be bought up and rise to gold prices? I think as soon as it is recognized by one big investment house.
Very interesting.

Also yesterday there were several people who repeatedly falsely posted that China had outlawed bitcoin when very clealry China did just the opposite  by declaring it unequivocably legal. No honest reasonable person could have posted it was made illegal. Those who did need to be excluded from this community even if they just were honestly stupid.
I beleive more than anything those false posts led to this recent unnecessary drastic panic selloff.
It got so bad yesterday that every refutation I POSTED yesterday quoting the actual document that China had assured bitcoins legality got voted down by a very concerted group of the same people that I sacrastically said fine, crash it to 800 and il buy some in the morning becuase I knew that would be the effect when I had to go to sleep. Sure enough they did! The top posts were full of nothing but false claims about China banning bitcoin and making it illegal. All well known by the people who posted those that it was factually false.
Major media picked up the false posts about illegality in china too. They read this subreddit as THE GO TO PLACE FOR BITCOIN KNOWLEDGE.
We have to stop factually false postings and ban those who do it. Perhaps some new account posting limits are worthwhile?

I'd be very surprised if it doesn't reach gold market cap by the end of 2014.
That would be $600,000 / bitcoin not merely $70,000.
The big hedge funds now have to get in because the highest performing hedge fund from last year was just announced and was the only one invested in bitcoin. So this year all the others will need to be in and that will be billions flowing into bitcoin for the first time. And they will be investing with other peoples money and people always invest other people's money faster than their own.
Up to now bitcoin has been driven by real people putting in their own real money.
The hedge fund flood will be totally different. Much faster influx and higher. Price pressure.
It COULD reach $600,000 in a month.  The rate of acceleration into bitcoin is getting faster. The exponent is increasing itself exponentially.
It did 10 x in 4 months but it did 4x in onemonth of that.
10 x times 10 x gets you to $100,000 then its only 6 x to gold market cap although things may temporarily slow at gold marketcap. However at that point it is still undervalued becuase the total currencies of the world will also be investing a portion of their holdings in bitcoin becuase bifcoin is both a wealth protector like gold AND a currency.
At that point it may take more time to intergrate as currency and not just have the goldbug type hedge money safety portion driving acceleration.

The notice does not say what the press releases says as you translatedit.
The actual notice is clearly aimed at financial banks for the restricitions with the exception of money laundrering and referring to bitcoinas a legal currency.
It's clear. read it. the press rrelease is broad and undirected. The actual notice is very specific. the press Release summary is not a true summary of the notice. Even if they wrote both in one government department (which I highly doubt becuase that is not how press releases are written) and you translated it perfectly (and you may have) the People who wrote the press release wrote something that differs substantally and importantly from the official notice.
The notice is the document.
The press relase is someones - anyones- perhaps hastily written piss poor summary of what they incorrectly broadly say the notice says.
The notice is the official document.
The press release is just that - a press release.
I am not saying your translation is wrong in fact I and I am sure everyone thanks you for it and assumes you did a great job.

hell we may be riding waves until 1,000,000 per BC  but the tide willc ontinue to rise overall unless there is a technical unfixable flaw or legal stoppage or better alternative.
The more the BIG MONEY and international money gets in (and I think that has already happened too much to have it be stopped) the greater the protection against it being legally stopped.
Also since the FEC is talking about allowing it too be used for campaign contributoins -- once politicians see it as a source of incoming money it will NEVER be stopped!

Gold has no intrinsic value .
That's just a goldbug cover story.
If gold wasn't valued as an  INVESTMENT  because it is SHINY it would be the heaviest, softest, hardest to transport, least convenient and least  wanted metal on earth. Gold is SHINY lead.
Its only valuable because it is scarce and used as a wealth allocation.
There is nothing you can make from gold that isn't better made from another metal or alloy.
Its a falsehood that Gold has intrinsic value.
Swim across a lake with Gold and then tell me about its intrinsic value compared to aluminum or titanium.

Its going to keep doubling every 4.to 6 months or so until it hits gold marketcap around. 600,000 / per coin.
Dec 1200
April 2400
August 4200
Jan 2015..9000
April 18000
Aug 32000
Dec 64000
April 2016 120,000
Aug 240,000
Jan 2017. 420,000
March 600,000
I think somewhere inthere will be another doubling as finally alll finacial investors get on board and stop wondering and jump in so as not to be more left behind. and it is hit with a flush of money that may double or quadruple it in two months or less whenevert that Happens. In fact it may cause the expomenetial rise to be a factor of 4 instead of two until gold market cap.
So that mean 600,000.may happen two to 8 months sooner with one bump or if it changes the exponent then maybe it might happen in 2016.
Once ownig bitcoinb ecomes as commonly accepted as owned some gold then the floods will open and it will be a quick race to get in before cit reaches gold marketcap of 600,000 /coin. We actually are getting there now so this could conceivably happen as early as the end of next gear.
Once resistance falls the money tank fills to level equal to alternatives like gold very quickly.
I also think it will slow as it approaches gold market cap because that poopl going itno gold is finite and as bitcoin approaches it people will slow down becuase bitcoin doesn't pay dividends so you no longer are Investing for gain but simply a safety allocation  like gold.

    It is a big mistake to compare bitcoin to gold regardless of the value. 
No.Its helpful.
    Gold has value because of its intrinsic desirability. 
No. It has no intrinsic value. It's value is as a preception of wealth.. as a metal it is useless, soft and heavy. only alloys work and their blending components are better than gold for everything except slight electrical conductive uses so extreme they are imamterial for comparision. (and it's use in Jewelry are solely based on its wealth perception. its too soft for rings and titatnium or aluminum for example are both tougher for jewelery and can be alloyed with copper for a shiny golden color. gold has no advantage for jewelry - in act it is defficient which is why it MSUT be ALLOYED with other metals to half or nearly 3/4 strength 10K or 14K etc)
    Bitcoin has value because it is useful for transacting quickly over short or long distances.
That's one value. The biggest value is that its total amount is indivisable 
and as a storage of wealth that can be transfereed around theplanet and not subject to single jurisdiction embargo.
    and Gold has a relatively stable and reliable value. 
historical proven wrong.
    Bitcoin has value only so long as it is more useful and more accepted than something else.
no difference from gold or silver
    Gold is a store of wealth. 
    Bitcoin a currency.
More a store of wealth. It is only used LIKE a currency for a small percentage (by value) of it's transfers.  in that it is also similiar to gold which also be used like a currency but rarely is.
    There is an opportunity to profit by investing in the early days of bitcoin, but the risk is always high. 
high is an arbitratrary adjective and logic doesn't support higher risk than other things. right now for example gold is falling fast and Bitcoin is steadily rising dramatically over a period of 3 yrs. Which is "high risk" by the evidence?
    Let's be careful when comparing apples and oranges.
Yes, You be careful.

Let's just remember that even if every single company in China stopped accepting Bitcoin as a purchasing option it would make NO DIFFERENCE because Bitcoin **has not grown based on being currency** dispite the utopian dreams of some associated with it who really want to be able to **buy pizza** with their Bitcoin.
**Bitcoin has grown based on people wanting a digital alternative store of wealth - gold 2.0.**
And as a digital replacement for gold **there is still 600X upside before Bitcoin reaching market parity with Gold.  That's $600,000 per Bitcoin.**
Baidu has not **ever had a gnat's ass worth of their purchases be in Bitcoin** and neither has any other retailer.
Baidu just started accepting Bitcoin a month or two ago.
Remember **China has FIRMLY COME OUT and declared Bitcoin is LEGAL AS A COMMODITY LIKE GOLD.**
I know some people want to be able to buy their internet or pizza or lollipops with their bitcoin but that isn't and **never has been the primary reason people are buying Bitcoin.**
People are buying it because it is a **shelter and safety and transportable and secure and mostly private means to store their wealth** across country borders without banks.
You can still always go buy and sell your Bitcoin from reall people on the street at localbitocins.com and then buy your pizza. And again **China has CLEARLY and DEFINITELY said it is LEGAL for people to buy and sell Bitcoin .**
There is NO dispute about that.
I suspect Baidu is halting bitcoin payment until they get some clarification after the notice precisely because it matters so little to their bottom line . As soon as they get a little more certainty after the recent announcement by China they will probably put it back. Hell Baidu probalby has been reading the wrong stuff posted on r/Bitcoin and got worried they might be doing something wrong they said why risk it and took it down.

I find it interesting that the average person actually is TERRIFIED of making money in the quantities and the way banksters have been doing it forever.
Don't do anything. your life is the same. You still need to eat and breathe. Don't panic. The world isn't really different. If you have never had money it will take you time to realize it doesn't change anything except that you might not have to do things you don't like as much (you'll still have to do tons of things you don't like).
Just frankly don't TELL ANYONE if you have made a pile of money. Your relationships WILL CHANGE WITH EVERYONE IF YOU SUDDENLY TELL THEM YOU HAVE MONEY.
DON"T DO IT. JUST SHUT UP.
And don't make any decisions. 
Don't quit your job. Don't quit your spouse. 
 (well maybe subdivide your wallets and separate a few of them but don't screw up and lose everything trying to "put it in a safe place". that stupid mistake happens all the time.)
Don't make any decisions.
Not until you have had the money sitting for at least a few months.
And be careful when you drive. If you are freaked out and distracted you will have a huge chance of doing something dumb like running a red light and getting killed. That would suck.
Now sit back down and take a breath. life is the same. it is exactly the same.
Oh and remember how life sucked when you had no money because you will forget that feeling and be tempted to buy a ferrari on credit which you will lose when you can't afford the payments and then you will once again have no money if you don't remember that horrible feeling BEFORE buying the damn stupid piece of tin with red paint on it. 
Go buy a peice of sheet metal from Home Depot and a spray can and paint it red if you have visions of a Ferrari. STARE at it. Is it REALLY better that it was? No. It's still a piece of damn sheet metal.
Don't buy it.

If you look at the actual "protections" that exist now for things like PayPal and credit cards they are horrendous for sellers. PayPal is so bad it can actually seize your whole bank account funds and they often do!
Besides quit frankly many of the payment protection services really have more to do with consumer as wanting  to buy and return products as free rentals. While sellers can of course still offer refunds, bitcoin can get us back to a more proper relationship were a customer makes a decision to buy and the seller can count on it.
Don't forget seller reputation still has a huge effect and sellers who cheat buyers won't last long.

absolutely wrong.
see this 
from a native chinese speaker who operates in China.
   3. 3.Bobby's conclusion is wrong, but he could possibly misrepresent his idea. He said bitcoin is NOT ALLOWED to xxx. That's definitely not true. Only financial and payment institute can't provide service that is related to or priced by bitcoin. But if you are someone selling a smartphone on Taobao(Chinese version of Ebay), you can definitely accept bitcoin if you like to. The problem is: normally both sellers and buyers prefer to finish the purchase via "Alipay"( Chinese version of Paypal). Since payment institutes cannot touch bitcoin after the announcement. Any default risk during this process would be taken by sellers and buyers themselves.
   Back in May this years, there had already been many online shops on Taobao accepting bitcoin. They did that mainly because it was cool. But since the general public in China aren't desire to use this fancy way of buying stuff, sellers don't have enough reason to promote bitcoin. As for now, there is almost no one on Taobao accept bitcoin."

Flaw is improbable becuase the software is open source and has been looked at by cryptogeeks for four years. But if thre was it could be fixed and the software updated. Bitcoin has done that before. The transaction records are preserved.
Just like with stocks you look at all the exchanges.  Depends on the time and what part of the world you want to notice most.
There can always be other currencies but adoption takes time and time gives everyone time to adjust.
Furthermore just like anything of value no one should have everything they own in one type of value. Thus if another currency finds a place say in domain registration like namecoin or casinos like casino coin they would all have a stablising effect on each other. Becusse of bitcoins hard established mining scarcity limits it will likely always be the major reserve of crptocurrencies.
There a millions of websites for every little thing but Google still exists.
Bitcoin likely will hold s similair central position if any other alternative currencies do better in small niches.

Looks like chinese once again arrested a couple of crooks who were running a bitcoinscam.
They operated a site that sold bitcoin on 10 x leverage and then ran off with the money when things got bad for them.
Once again bitcoin trading is NOT illegal in china and the authorities there are working hard to keep scammers like these from ripping people off so the bitcoin market can remain honest.
The chinese arrested some other people using bitcoin to steal peoples money back in november. The chinese are doing a good job of protecting the bitcoin traders from scam artists. Further proof bitcoin is there to stay in chia.
On a second note... darkwings do your banker people who pay you to run down bitcoin so they can buy in more cheaply give you some kind of early morning alert so you wake to post this stuff at 6 am or do they pay you to stay up all night posting anti bitcoin popaganda¿

I haven't seen that video for a long time.
That was made way back when it was still possible to get an anti corproate message to the front page on reddit and I was glad to doit.
I think that was a top ten post of all time I made pointing out that health insurance companies drop your coverage the minute they determine you will cost them more than they can suck out of you.. gues that kind of proves I am the OPPOSITE of a shill doesn't it?
And you complained about it getting so many Upvotes.
You were the first kharma jealous person I had ever heard of.
Either that or you are the shill being paid by companies to protect their goals.
So are banks paying you now to help them keep Bitcoin down?
Is that why you are always so negstive:
I saved that old video for posterity.
Actually I have been fighting the shills for years on reddit as the video shows.
I wish I was paid.
P.s. I'll care about kharma only when it can buy bitcoins.

The only thing people really know is where coins are being bought and sold by the exchange.
People also know the obvious pressures that exist to sell which for example are end of the year things in the west like Christmas spending needs.
Its the same for the stock market analysts on the financial netwroks who say  the stock market went down today beciase of xyz. They don't really know why the whole thing went down. Everyone knows its their estiamte.. they do know however probably know primary pressures exiting at the time.

I swear there are people here just waiting to create more denial Bullshit about how they now think bitcoin is crap.
China CLEARLY STATED BITCOIN IS LEGAL TO OWN AND TRADE.
THEY CLEARLY SAID IT CAN BE A COMMMODITY LIKE GOLD which is why 99% of people were buying Bitcoin to begin with. 
This just enlarged the Bitcoin alternative to gold market by 3 BILLION PEOPLE!

I guess a backtrack to the previous high as a base point with two 250% climbs and 50% retrenchments one of which may breifly peak at over $1300. I would guess it would fall back again and then later NEXT year 18 motnhs be at a stable $1300 or so.
however I do think the international and traditional investors now in Bitcoin may prevent the kind of 50 % temporary falls we had even just 6 months ago.
Plus the firehoses of money are really focused on bitcoin now fromt he very big pockets. SO I coud be greatly underestimating the rise potential.
There is really no inherent limit to the speed at which it could rise at this point becuase real big money is now allocating to bitcoin and there just isn't that much bitcoin!

Silver... AHHHH HHAA HAA HAAA
well it probably took them 6 months to get approval from the bosses to even issue this so  that would explain why their analysis is 6 months behind.
We have already almost breeched their "Maximum market capitalization" at $1300 per bitcoin. 
That must have seemed almost unbelievable 6 months ago but now it's just ridiculously low.
We'll be there this week after the Breakthrough Chinese announcement saying Bitcoin is legal and like gold and that the chinese government will defend Bitcoin from unscrupulous Banksters trying to corrupt it and screw it up.
Frankly there is no legitimate remaining reason why any honest and rational analyst could say why Bitcoin can't go to the market cap of gold now (Which China literally said it was like) which means $600,000 PER BITCOIN. Gold market cap is after all a very small portion of the total world wealth of aorund $200-250 Trillion dollars and Bitcoin is better than Gold at it's own game AND is also a transaction system AND a currency.

I upvoted just to show there are many people here like the op  who have no concept of what bitcoin is and just want to try to create downward pressure or hype any sign of trouble.

I frankly don't know why they troll this subreddit.
If they don't believe in bitcoin why are they so determined to hang around.

@_date: 2013-11-18 03:51:34
(now is not a great time to buy)
look, either you beleive bitcoin will have a marketcap at least equal to gold or you don't really understand what bitcoin is.
If you beleive that then you don't want to be sitting on the sidelines waiting for temporary lulls in price becuase there may not be any in it's marketcap realization curve.
Bitcoin isn't something people should be buying for in's and out's of the day or week and it's not playing a stockpoint curve or something.
Bitcoin is a revolutionary fundementally valued currency system with a huge potential in the world.
If you believe that then until it starts approaching the market cap of gold ($600,000 per bitcoin) there is no reason to hesitate.
(Of course never invest more than you can hold for months because there could always be another temporary dip. But frankly anothe rlong dip is a lot less likely because there are so many more buyers all around the world. A few geeks in their basement in the USA can't crash the market anymore whenthey sell their early bitcoins.

the math to buy 1 million bitcoin satochis which are 100,000,000 to one bitcoin is
current $ price of one bitcoin ($256 last i looked) divided by 100,000,000 (the numbe rof bitcoin satochis in one bitcoin) multiplied by 1 million (since you want to be a satochi millionaire)
so $256/100,000,000*1,000,000 = $2.56

I have seen more people trying to crash bitcoin on this subreddit in the last few weeks than I ever remember.
They don't post any analysis at all and just scream it will crash or that others are hyping.
Meanwhile every person who says they think it is going up explains why they think so and provides detailed mathematical analysis about why they think so.
We have also now had multiple mainstream media magazines and professional analysts give targets anywhere from $1300 (by far the lowest) to $1,000,000 in places like Bank Of America to Businessinsider and more.
I am against censorship but I am beginiing to think we need to have a rule that you can't just scream its going to crash unless you provide some analysis . And it can't just be because it went up or because everyone else you beleive is a shill.
In fact the more real possibility is that these screamers trying to crash bitcoin and scare people are doing it to be able to buy at cheaper prices or because they sold their bitcoin and are bitter that it has risen.
There is also the very real possibilty that this is the case: Millions of dollars are at stake for banks and major funds who now want in as cheaply as they can, and we know other parts of Reddit are infested with PR people hired to promote corporate objectives. It has been documented and traced many times in other subreddits and PR companies now actively promote on their website the work they do to influence opinions on social media including nameing reddit by name.
Most people here who beleive in bitcoin are or were small money investors who are not professional and simply honestly beleive they are on to something that makes sense and has a great future. That why they bought some.
The burden is on the other side to present a real case and if they do people would listen becuase as people with mone yin bitcoin i guareentee we would like to know anything we havent thought of that might be a vulnerability. But these screamin ranters should be banned if they simply keep screaming crash with no analysis.
This subreddit is where new people come to learn about bitcoin from all over the world. It is mentioned in multiple publicatios as the place to go to learn about bitcoin. We can't allow screamers with possible bad motives to scare them with unsupported and unjustified rants. The subreddit has a responsibilty to present a more reasoned analysis than that to newcomers.
We can have fun and we should. This shouldn't be a dry place. bitcoin is fun and we let off steam. but major price claims need some analysis. Th eupsiders provide. The downsiders simply scream. 
The FACTS are Bitcoin has steadily grown for 4 yrs. Steadily.
Bitcoin has now been stated to be legal in congressional hearings and Chinese statements and multiple fund managers just inthe last month. that's a HUGE credibility inhancer.
Real hedge finds are invested and they werethe best performing hedge fund of last year of ALL hedge funds. Others are starting to invest. 
The people who conceived facebook, The Winklevii twins whom we all love to chuckle about, but who actually DID conceive and hire Marc Zuckerberg to program Facebook for them, are heavily invested in bitcoin. Those guys have a track record and they say Bitcoin is better than gold gold 2.0 and the gold share of world wealht is 600x Bitcoins ... that's a lot of upside room for Bitcoin.
ALL the momentum and approval and factual pricing history and  future documented demand is in favor of bitcoin longterm growth. ALL OF IT.
There is NO negative data against the growth of bitcoin now. None.
People can have their opinion but they shouldn't be able to scream fire in a theater everyday without showing us some flames.

bitcoin has been aroudn and widely covered inthe media for three years. during that time it has kept getting more and more investors. It has risen in value.
It has been scrutinized to hell and each time it comes out stronger than before.
it isn't a fad becuse hugely wealthy people and institutions NEED a place to spread their money out.
Bitcoin is one such place. It will ALWAYS be one such place.
That's all it has to be and it will rise to the market capitalization rate for gold. That means $600,000 per bitcoin.

I dont know whether the chinese currency has more propensity to crahs than any other fiat currency right now. they do however manufacture more goods and exports so have the economi\y to naturally back their currency.
But they have openly stated that want an alternative to the Dollar as the national reserve currency. They openly stated they were going to stop buying the dollar.
they openly stated that bitcoin may be the thing that is that alternative.
I think they are far more worried about havigna great profitable economy and losing allthose profits in usa dollars that inflate and lose money than they are in worryingabout their currency.
Just my opinion but it makes intellectual sense.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:03:22
What I always say is the same.
Bitcoin is headed for a marketcap equal or exceeding gold which means $600,000 per bitcoin or so.
On the way it will vibrate in levels of variation that make no difference at all in the long haul.
That's the only important thing.
It on't pick daily fluctuations becuase no one can. it's silly. And it doesn't matter.
whatever it is - buy.

Bitcoin has temporary publicity peaks which inevitably die down but over the past 3 yrs it has seen steady increasing adoption and valuation that is so high above alternative investments availble to the average person that it mkaes great sense to put some money into bitcoin.

Any investment you make that is thrid party like Bitcoin or stocks or gold or land or managed 401 k or ANYTHING is speculation.
All anyone does is try to pick the things that they beleive have a fundemental reason for existing and provide a good service which Bitcoin does.

Excuse me by tthis is a (ERRORONEOUS)  CONCLUSION Bobby Lee made which is clearly erroroneous based on the advisory from China.
Specifically China said anyone and any businesses except financial institutions can trade in Bitcoin as they wish.  They can exchange their goods and services for them as the wish. The advisory clearly says that.
The ONLY reference China made about the RMB being the official currency was that it said since the RMB is the ONLY OFFICIAL currency then people can only be forced legally to make debt s etc payable in the officially currency.
In other words no-one can be FORCED to accept or pay in Bitcoins .
It doesnt mean people can't legally use bitcoins.
Bobby Lee needs to apologize and retract this silly blunder.
Its just like in the  USA  if you owe a debt you can only be FORCED to pay it in us dollars. You can't be FORCED to pay in Bitcoin. It doesn't mean you can't pay in Bitcoin if both parties agree.
I can't beleive the audience would let him get away with such an amatuerish blunder.

I think firs time owners buy for one address then as they get Davy split those amounts into more addresses.
There fore you can get an idea from addresses that hold coin for the first time that also transfer to other addresses that hold coin for the first time as they split coin across addresses.
Most people are limited in what they can purchase so I imagine most people buying and holding will only use one to four addresses.
I'd loved to know the number addresses that day trade which ought to be easy to tell as well.

Either you think bitcoin is long term under valued and the price in two days doesn't change that or you don't
You give them whatever you want to spend and they get that amount of bitcoin at whatever price when the order is placed right?

I think bitcoin is way beyond merchant adoption at this point.
bitcoin is a hedge against inflation,currency seizure, etc.
merchant adoption got it taken seriously as a currency.
now anyone would be crazy to spend bitcoin on anything physical at least until it stops jumping up in value so much.
Remember if you bought a product for 1 bitcoin yesterday by today you had just paid 33% more for it.

Well Edison was a theif, patent officer briber, and cheater of his employees (notably Tesla ) so not the best example perhaps.
And j worry that someone who doesn't know that must not have really researched their subject very well.
Its like when I hear about a book that says why Bill Gates was such a great programmer or innovator. I immediately know they don't know a thing about why Microsoft and gates succeeded. He succeded by hijacking and suppressing others innovation and he did it extremely well. (so well the phrase "embrace and extend" was the code for "hijack then exclude" among the tech community for Microsoft's business practices.)( he only programmed one traffic light bit of code on an old IBM minicomputer and bought MSDos lock stock and barrel from a guy without telling him they had presold it to IBM.)

china LOVES bitcoin. they said so last week.
they have been looking for a currency that can't be manipulated and they want out of the US dollars and said they would stop buying it.
They don't want foreign banks taking control of Bitcoin because they beleive it might be the currency solutiion they were looking for.
They basically said that last week or so.

Prepare your meetup maybe post something like this to your meetup response page before the meeting and email all meetup attendents.
.Be calm.
Do not predict the destruction of the dollar.
Respond that bitcoin is NOT volitile but has sustained steady monthly growth for over  4 years now with less downturns than Gold or the dollar or Facebook stock.
Say more vendors accept bitcoin every day and often give bitcoin buyers discounts.
Bitcoin is not complicated like gold subsurface mining or wall street curency derivatives. Bitcoin can be a free app on your phone.
You can   ow buy lamborghinis and pizza and houses and plane flights and even trips to space on Virgin Galatic with bitcoin. A police chief is now getti g paid I. Bitcoins.  
They WILL SAY They are "volitilex or "risky".
Respond above.
They WILL say they are complicated. Say they are less complicated than your bank statement.
They WILL try to paint you as a nut. .
Say "i wish I had a tinfoil hat that could catch bitcoins!". Unfortunately they are too valuable!
They WILL SAY they have "no intrinsic value like gold or money"
Say "i can buy an ounce of gold with one bitcoin but how could I pay for a pizza that was $7.99 with gold and get cha get change?"
Be calm.  Don't be too excited. Wear very conservative clothes. 
They will run the clip where you look goofy or make a mistake so give them as few chances as possible.
They will also HAVE THE CAMERA RUNNING ALL THE TIME before you sit down or whatever. Anything goofy you say or any nervous laughter between you that they capture they will edit in Ronald you look nervous about bitcoin.
Keep answers short.
Smile always.
Remember it is the local news editors dream to edit a price that has some humor or looks forboding.
They will fake and scramble footage to make this happen when it didn't.
Local. News is the worst about this becuase they do t know better.
Demand permission before allowing full netwrok national usage. Pre authorize ONLY LOCAL USE UNTIL YOU CAN SEE THE STORY IN FINAL EDIT. They might edit it right In The news van which is typical so look at it there.
Oh yeah. They WILL SAY "it has risen so fast . It must be a bubble".
 Say well I keep waiting for the fast adopters of email and cellphones to stop using them too becuase their adoption curve was faster but people seem to still find email and cellphones useful and will find bitcoin useful in 10 more years too.
Edit: they wil say "the illegal operation silk road used them for drugs and stuff!!! Have you used the m for drugs?
Be prepared. Don't hesitate. Have your answer ready..say something like the police seize million s of cash dolars every week with drugs but that doesn't mean  the George Washington s in your pocket don't buy more movie tickets and popcorn and gifts for grandkids than bad things.
.also the police chief is getting paid in them in Gucci Kentucky at his request
