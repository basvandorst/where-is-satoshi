@_date: 2017-12-22 08:39:55


No, Trust me.... Just HODL
I bought at ATH so many times and it always go higher.
You can also do AVERAGING. Keep Buying so the buy price will become lower and when the price go back, you will get profit.

Since they are still using previous payment gateway, why does it a 90% drop in sales ?
@_date: 2014-06-28 04:05:52
Just want to point out that Bitcoin is much better.
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:40:00
And widely accepted.
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:56:31

@_date: 2014-01-25 10:38:52
Have you try to contact them ?
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:39:24
Can't wait to see the result. But I believe this time Bitcoin is gonna win.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:34:09
I think acq = acquisition. 
Get ready for another reason from MtGox.
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:40:05
If Gox is dead, there will be another BTC exchanger. Maybe Bigger...
This won't stop Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:12:52
Indonesia will say hi soon...
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:00:51
The problem is your email. If your email were compromised, they can do anything.

Summoning the ToTheMoonGuy....
@_date: 2015-05-25 05:43:38
yeah, I also think that is just typo.
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:26:34
Good decision for 1Hash. 
Ant pool will be forgotten as they choose the wrong path.
@_date: 2016-01-21 05:06:31
you just got yourself a profit of 10%. it is 2/3*(422-376) = $30. 
Scale it by 10, you got $300 
Scale it by 100, you got $3,000 
Scale it by 1000, you got $30,000

What happened in the pruning bitcoin core ?
Let's say I put prune =550. And let the size of blockchain is 1Mb.
Does that mean that my client will only store 550 blocks ?
If I make a spent on my wallet in the same pruned client. After 550 blocks ~3.8 days, the history will not be available and I will not be able to see bitcoin amount on the wallet in the pruned client ?
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:12:48
I stilk don't quite understand the number.
What is the meaning 550?
What happened if I put it lower, like 100 or 50?
What happened if I put higher number such as 1000 ?
I notice that if I put 550, my computer will need around 24 hours to co.plete the initial syncing, but if I put 100, it only need 12 hours.
I didn't try with higher number.
Does anyone have any explanation ? ELI5 maybe ?
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:24:58
I get it now. 
Thanks luke..
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:09:23
sorry, what is FDA ?
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:47:16
Is that new money going to be bitcoin or bcash?
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:10:30
Yeah, I still remember that new user only need email and username. I don't have any idea how they will do kyc.
Anyone can just make a fake ID to do kyc and withdraw out from btce, especially the villains.
@_date: 2017-01-15 02:04:24
I thought it was Finance .. something.
thanks for the suggestion
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:19:55
If I run bitcoin core with pruneblockchain 100,
Does it also count as full node ?
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:51:57
I still have full access to the wallet and all password. I just send money to namecheap at july 2017. I just noticed they are closed and encourage people to move to electrum with seed words.
I completely forget the seed words. I am very nervous that my coins are gone or can't be moved anywhere.
@_date: 2016-11-11 04:16:47
Thanks. I understand now. 
this also help me for context : 
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:20:54

Remember when BTC is 1000 USD and fell to $10? 
For the price to go up, it is necessary to go down. 
Just HODL...
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:29:58
This should be upvoted and be the first post.  
The same is for Indonesia. The legal payment system in Indonesia are Indonesian Rupiah, Not USD, not Gold either.
This is the official press release from Indonesian Central Bank :  [

What is it about multibit ?
What's wrong with them ?
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:47:10
I really hope they manage to delete the whole site first before the US fed.
And in my opinion, I think it is nearly impossible for them to get back online.
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:17:57
Good Day !!!

You should contact their support. I am not their support. And this thread is 3 months old
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:32:57
You should send a ticket again. Complaining here will get you nothing
