@_date: 2017-12-26 20:17:02
It could be easier for me because I am in a city center, but the search function just brings them to me. If you want you can pm me ur location and I can look for large sellers/buyers and their methods, but you should be able to do it on your own. Some offer bank transfers but cash in person is best to be anonymous.

It is because the total size didn't increase at all and didn't effect anything on the graph, just a change in color. If that amount was added at once you would see a spike in the graph total (if all was 1 color)

The guy running that site, and cryptoasylum is awesome! �� to @_date: 2017-12-01 14:44:34
Check this site:
When the dips at the top eat into the purple section (your fee was 11sat/b so in the 10-20 sat/b section).
This might happen tomorrow or in a week. If it doesn't happen within 2 weeks ur transaction is rejected and sent back (rather never sent to begin with).
Edit * there are transaction accelerators you can pay to add higher miner fees to the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:52:34

Your reading the graph wrong. On that day is the day the graph making site split the 0-2 into 0-1 and 1-2. The blue area was there before as a part of the area above it. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:10:44
You paid 	17.841 sat/B, so it's probably not going to confirm for a longgg time

Diamond is a scam
Edit* there is no way to claim your coins as it was not a split or snapshot. Only way to got bitcoin Diamond was to deposit your bitcoin into their website before the snapshot date. And even then no one verified it works and didn't just steal your bitcoin.

Of course you can buy a whole bitcoin or multiple bitcoin. It might just be an exaggerated phrase as if they feel no matter how much they save they will not afford a whole bitcoin, like if they can only save 20$ a month.

I was actually not buying or selling my btc on coinbase, but was using it as my wallet. I had received all my btc as payment for various jobs, and as soon as I tried to send them to a new address outside of coinbase (to a blockchain wallet)  they were forever stuck in "Pending" and I could see they were never added to a block to begin with. Things might be different when selling, so hopefully someone with some experience in that area will chime in for some input. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:48:46
this. You should always make your decisions based on what you've researched and what risks you can take. I learned the hard way, as I would educate someone close to me about bitcoin, he would tell me it's too risky to invest yet would personally go buy hundreds of bitcoin. why? i have no fucking clue. What i learned is you don't know what other people know and even if you did, you don't know their motives. 
Generally though, people would say not to borrow money, or sell all your assets for bitcoin because this brings uneducated speculators who don't even know bitcoin's ideology before putting everything on the line. It also makes them extremely nervous investors.

It depends where you're from but if you log in to your wallet it should say what your options are on the right hand side. 
You could continue buying from coinbase but don't make it your wallet for storage.

Good article, but I'm wishing they didn't focus so much on the price of bitcoins, and how much people could potentially win vs lose, but focused more so on how bitcoin is a promising new system. This type of article is what makes a bubble more likely.

Yes! When you make a paper wallet you get two keys. One is the one you use to send bitcoin to this wallet (you can post it publicly because no one can gain access to your account with this key alone). 
The second key is the more important one because this is the one that you need to be able to spend/manage the btc in the account, and this key is the one you need to protect.
This way, if you made a paper wallet to act like a savings account you can deposit money when ever you like but to withdraw you need to import the private (second) key from the paper wallet.
Hope I explained that well enough, &gt;&lt;

Coinbase has a LOT of problems. First on the list would be terrible customer service, because the problems wouldn't be so bad if they would address things properly. But common issues are incorrect balances (showing -10 BTC for example), transactions forever stuck in pending (never even included in a block), transactions being in limbo (so you get an email every 10 minutes that you transferred X amount of btc, and it wont actually get processed), and when buying many times it will be canceled to to "high risk" w.e. that means. 
You can see the details of my Coinbase problem [here](

In your wallet home, there should be something that says:




Take that address and input it in the appropriate place here:
to spend/send the bitcoin, go to the send money tab in your blockchain wallet, put in the RECEIVING address (that looks similar to yours), put how much and voila!

Everyone involved in Bitcoin has a regret story. Whether it's for not acting sooner, not learning about it earlier, for selling, not buying, or buying items early on for what now is worth butt loads. Personally, I wish I bought at ~$3 when I first looked into it but eventually you let it go as **you made the best decision you could with what you knew at the time.** hindsight is always 20/20.

In your blockchain wallet, after you signed in, go to "Send Money" tab at the top, (it will automatically send you to "Quick Send") input their address, and the amount, and DONE! easy as pie. 
If you want to send the btc from a specific address (if you have btc in more than one address in your wallet) then go to the "Custom Send" tab on the left hand side.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:11:47
Only in this aspect. Not so in the case of storage/transfering large amounts of gold, or divisibility (it's hard to give exact prices in silver, or to get change back), and no one knows how much gold there is in the world. 
Cash, as in fiat money has the problem of corrupt bankers and government soiling the whole system.
Ask yourself, is it more likely that the banks/government will screw you over, or the internet will get shut down?
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:22:47
What you're talking about is day trading, and I would not suggest you do it especially if you haven't done it before.

For a bitcent to be worth tens of thousands it means a bitcoin would be worth 1 million and there is lots of growing until then, but owning a bitcent (0.01 btc) would make you ahead of the majority of the population.

He also said it would be a success when Max Keiser was on. "Predicting" both outcomes means he would have been "right" either way. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:10:06
first, you're assuming everyone is SELLING their bitcoins, and that is not the case. And even if someone buys all the bitcoins in existence except for 1, it will still work just as well, as it can be divided infinitely (though right now it goes to 8 decimal places) so transactions would be for 0.00000001 btc.

This is because bitcoin is new (and thus experiencing growth pains) and the media has been writing articles that don't even cover the advantages to bitcoin over the current system and just advertise it as a get rich quick scheme, saying you could loose 100% but gain much much more.
Like this article:
This stupidity invites greedy speculators that don't have a clue about bitcoin, but once it's been around for a while and stabilizes, no doubt it is a much much MUCH better system. 
I, and many others that actually understand what bitcoin has to offer, are in for the long haul.

@_date: 2013-03-22 14:09:59
And easy to follow how to guide:
1.Create Bitcoin Keypairs with vanitygen or  and unplug your computer from the internet before generating Keypairs. 
2.Write down your Bitcoin addresses somewhere (You don't have to secure them)
3.Add the generated private keys to a file and encrypt the file with gpg (on linux: gpg --symmetric filename). Use a password with more than 10 characters and make absolutely sure you will never forget this password.
4.Delete the original file. Backup the encrypted file on usb sticks, cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, ...), physical sheets of paper, your friend's computer ...
5.Format the hard drive
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:36:46
The wallet backup has in it the addresses and private keys for the addresses you used so if the amount in the addresses changes it is still fine. If you move bitcoins to a new address not included in the backup then you need to update the file.

Interesting, haven't seen this question yet! If you use blockchain, you could enable 2 sets of passwords, where you know one, and someone else knows the other, so you both need to punch in the codes, but there might be better alternatives for this that I'm not aware of.
