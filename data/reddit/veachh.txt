That theft produces shitty roads and shitty public services people would get for much cheaper otherwise. If its so virtuous to help others, you would do it yourself and not wait for someone to steal from you in order to redistribute

if i ask you for money and threaten you if you don't pay, that's stealing. doesn't matter how virtuously i promise i will spend your money. same thing applies to governments
even if it was 100% used properly, that would still not change the definition. it is theft. but it's up to you to see if it is a necessary evil.
if you disagree by how your money is being used, there's always an alternative: pay for it willingly. don't wait for the government to change their ways

you mean, the thing that happens once a corporation corrupts the gov to give itself special advantages?
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:09:28
If i steal 1000 from you and say its for a good cause, it is still theft. (psssst, its rarely even for a good cause)

what up now keynes
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:55:02
very convincing
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:08:05
Thats rough man, what country?
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:13:48
The things private companies do better for much cheaper?
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:09:20
That way you make sure you dont panic sell or trade

the guy is in bed with all govs giving them intel as they ask. politicians hate when you compete with their currencies, except if you agree to share the data
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:33:20
the thing is, i'm afraid the guy hasn't changed inside. he just hides it now. this is old, but there are more recent examples of him not being very trustworthy

Plot twist: inflation is so fucked up you can barely buy a coffee with a million dollars

the good ol' "you gotta vote harder" for them to leave you alone or "try to convince your local thief to spare you"

sure, americans dont get shit back, but even if the service given back was good, i will have a problem with the fact the money was taken by force
@_date: 2019-12-24 23:17:40
Not necessarily. Most banks are private.
@_date: 2019-12-16 11:04:57
a democracy is just as evil as an oligarchy. yes. any system that lets X use force against Y against his will is garbage. i dont care if the decision came from 3 wealthy dudes on a throne or the collective. theft and violence is bad, and there are no better circumstances

I could not possibly get everything that wrong if i tried
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:23:38
human beings that actively try to rob and restrain me are not my "fellow men".
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:18:47
they already have your money, why would they try to be effective? perk of being thieves
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:48:33
i agree with that: if you want public services: pay for them
the issue is that i don't want to. and don't use them. and i still pay 40%. i benefit from the sidewalks and the lampposts, and thats about it really.

Dont buy bitcoin - it facilitates theft evasion
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:19:51
when was the last time a rich that wasnt part of the state did things to you against your consent?
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:25:29
i dont really want to be part of your democratic society utopia either. thats just as evil as when the rich do it
@_date: 2019-12-24 23:20:19
Are they? In america? Highly regulated and centrally planned, yes, but not really public
@_date: 2019-12-24 23:26:08
I guess the fact they are not a monopoly but an oligopole? That i can opt out of them (at least in some countries, i think the us requires you to be in one) 
I dont consider big data to be private when they are that much in bed with gov, but i guess they technically are private?
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:12:34
"sorry, some thief was faster than you!"
@_date: 2019-12-11 23:00:39
not what i asked
@_date: 2019-12-12 00:17:06
Lol this wouldnt be any close to 20 dollzrs yearly, but i mezn they are already on binance and each satoshi counts
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:22:44
i dont recall the bitcoin paper specifying it had to be anonymous and private, but hey, if the competition does better on the part you care about, bitcoin was meant to be replicated and twisted/improved
@_date: 2019-12-24 21:19:32
Banks dont take your money, they just make it easier for the state to take it
@_date: 2019-04-29 09:55:52
that would be "nie shitcoin" then, not niet

the hero we needed
@_date: 2019-09-03 20:10:48
hello semyon
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:38:51
what happened??? anyways thanks for the sale
@_date: 2019-09-03 20:10:13
not the kind of recognition you'd like
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:20:48
HEY je suis vraiment pas loin, merci beaucoup de l'avertissement, j'arrive
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:15:55
the transaction was already half confirmed
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:08:57
it had a couple confirmations iirc, which is why i went ahead and traded (thankfully not all) it
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:18:02
yes, they showed me the block explorer with already a couple confirmations, it was more or less halfway done iirc, but never went past that
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:56:58
i see, so absolutely nothing i can do now then?
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:11:23
we will never be treated seriously until people realize it's more than just a speculative item
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:31:14
i hope you're trolling
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:51:17
no, i'm not the sender
i'm the receiver in that case, the guy promised me it was on the way with a proof and i just assumed it was as if confirmed and traded with him
