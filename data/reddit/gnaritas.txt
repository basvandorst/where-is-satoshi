OP, you're being stupid, educate yourself   There's no such thing as "house money", that's just a stupid rationalization you make up to avoid admitting that you've lost a million dollars of "your" money, and it was your money.  Calling it house money might make it feel better, but you'd be a fool to think you didn't suffer a real loss of real money that was yours. Calling it house money lets you behave irrationally, and while it probably won't cost you your fortune this time, that kind of thinking will eventually cost you it all.

Full faith and credit of the US government means the ability to payback loans through extraction of taxes through its citizens.  Creditors trust the government to pay them back; any government can claim to do that, but countries have credit ratings, creditors aren't stupid, they know which governments can actually do that.  That's why USD has value and Zimbabwe dollars don't.


No, that conclusion simply does not logically follow.  The government does far more than simply act means to give money value.  Your arguments do not logically connect to your conclusion.  You could say the parts of government involved in the monetary system should be counted, but no, not the entire government.

Ignorant; they couldn't function if they weren't stable in the short term.


That doesn't refute anything, I know people who do stupid things too, that doesn't mean those stupid things are how you should do things.


False, fiat is bad at storing value long term which is why the rich don't stay liquid, just as I said.


No, what banks do and corps do is short term, not long term. But now I know you don't know what you're talking about.


Investments with fixed returns at a guaranteed rate are stores of value; again you clearly don't know what you're talking about.  Go back to mommies basement and study some more, I'm not here to waste time educating children who don't understand basic things.

Functioning to a creditor means only able to pay back loans; the point you keep ignoring, and I've seen several people make this point to you, is that the government does far more than what creditors care about.  The value of money comes only from the subset of government operations that ensure they'll pay back creditors.  Creditors don't care about all the other parts of government. You've failed to make a logical case to convince me "all" parts of the government should be included. Governments do more than issue money, that's simply a fact you cannot ignore.

All currencies fail over long enough periods, 100% failure rate, because all civilizations eventually fail, gold failed as well. There's no such thing as money that lasts forever, money is a social agreement, not an asset, it's not supposed to last forever.


Incorrect, we don't want to pay it back, public debt is private savings. Our debt is fine, it's within historical norms as a percentage of GDP. It's been higher in the past during WWII. Fiat is working fine, the markets are vastly more stable under fiat than they ever were under gold; gold is terrible money.

Nope, currencies are meant to be stable stores of value in the short term to be used as a tool of exchange. They are not intended as long term stores of value as that requires properties that make for bad tools of exchange.  A currency can't be both, as Bitcoin will prove once again, and as gold did long ago. Inflation is a feature, it's what makes people willing to spend their money and keeps people investing in things driving progress in the markets. You want long term stores of values, buy some bonds. You want to gamble for a possible gain, buy some stocks or property.

@_date: 2018-09-09 16:51:32
Yea, that sucked, those periods were called booms and severe depressions. The failure of gold to allow a stable market is why fiat was invented and inflation turned those booms and depressions into mild bubbles and mild recessions, i.e. it worked and the markets are much more stable under fiat than they ever were under gold; because gold was shitty money.
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:29:23
No I'm not wrong, and yes I've been there and known about it for years, it doesn't make it any less stupid.  Real currencies don't have market caps, only economically illiterate crypto people do stupid shit like that because the vast majority of them don't understand money.  
The market cap of Apple is 223 billion USD; USD is the thing market cap is denominated in and measured by, market caps don't apply to thing used to measure market caps.  Saying the market cap of USD is X is utterly ignorant. USD is the measuring stick, not the thing being measured.  
Crypto has a market cap because it isn't a currency anything is denominated in, but because it's a commodity that's being measured with a real currency like USD.  You'll know crytpo is a currency when it's used to measure things and is no longer treated like a commodity with a market cap.  Market caps apply to companies and commodities, not currencies, which means crytpo still isn't a currency.  Currencies don't have market caps, currencies are the measure of market caps for things that are priced in them.
And just because some illiterate idiot puts up a website showing the total volume of bitcoin and other crypto measured in USD, doesn't make it a valid measure; it's just an idiot that doesn't understand currencies aren't stocks.

As I said, I have no axe to grind here, I don't debate bitcoin'ers about inflation anymore because in my opinion none of you understand what money is and because of this, you misconstrue government management of the economy's money supply as theft. It's a pointless debate I've had too many times because we won't agree on what money is supposed to be.  I did not deny the negative effects of central planning, nor do I deny the positive ones.  Nor did use any ad hominem justification; pointing out bias is not an ad hominem.
You claim the value of the dollar has dropped considerably over time "as if" that's a bad thing, you presume it bad the same as you presume printing money is theft but those are your biases based on your want for money to be wealth.  The modern world no longer takes that position, money is not wealth, money is a means of exchanging wealth, a tool, and inflating and deflating the supply of it to maintain sufficient liquidity in the market as well as targeted inflation to prevent money hoarding (which we call encouraging investment) is considered acceptable and responsible use by pretty much every government and mainstream economist on the planet.  The purpose of money is trade, it is not meant to be saved, only spent; those who want to save it, misunderstand the tool, and should be buying assets and saving them instead.  The only crowd who objects are the Austrians and frankly imho it's because they disagree on what money should be, they want it to be save-able wealth; but they lost long ago, their views on the nature of money are not in alignment with what money actually is in the real world. Inflation doesn't hurt those who use the tool correctly, for trade; it hurts those who try and stockpile it as if it were wealth.
You aren't going to make a single argument I haven't heard a dozen times, and I'm not going to make any you haven't.  So I'm going to agree to disagree and move on.
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:55:48


No, instability in terms of exchange for products. No one mentioned USD.  Stability in terms of monetary supply is simply irrelevant, when people are discussing inflation, they're not talking about money supply, they're talking about the stability of pricing of goods.  Bitcoin's money supply ensures goods cannot be priced stability and will likely suffer massive inflation over time.  Bitcoin will cause the worst inflation of any currency on the planet.


Not true. Bitcoin can function as a commodity, which it does, that gives it value; commodity values don't need to be stable.  That makes it useful as a means of exchange without any need to be the unit of account.
I don't need to read any books to understand Bitcoin, I've been here for years and more importantly I sell things on the Internet and buy things on the Internet and as a vendor and consumer, as well as a computer programmer, I understand the value of Bitcoin deeply from all angles.  What I'm not is an idealist living in a fantasy that lacks economic reality.  Bitcoin cannot and will not displace fiat and anyone who thinks so doesn't understand the financial system or how the world runs.

Bitcoin is attractive to more than just the "we hate fiat" cult.  Get over yourselves, Bitcoin is a new tool, we don't all think it's going to replace money, but it will have a place all its own for reasons that don't have anything to do with being better money because it enables new things to be built and it's a better payment system for the Internet.  We don't have be part of your little cult to be here.

Wrong, and more importantly, conspiracy theory nonsense.  The gold standard was abandoned for exactly the reason I said, it made poor money and it took the great depression to finally force the world accept that fact and move on.


Irrelevant, because in real life there is no just "supply side", there is simply the aggregate of supply and demand and when taken together, we've very much had deflationary currency before: gold.  Because demand exceeded supply creating... deflation and leading to depressions.


Good money doesn't increase in value when hoarded, that's what makes it good money.  I'm not confusing anything, you're merely not grasping what's being said.

Nothing if you see them as assets; currencies aren't assets and don't behave like assets.

The dollar goes down a very small and very predictable amount and is the most stable currency in the world; you're pretending to sound logical but you're being irrational, Bitcoin isn't just down for 3 quarters straight, it's down by an unpredictable 60% of its value while the dollar is down a very predictable perhaps 2%.  In that time-frame, the dollar has been a far better store of value than Bitcoin.

2 years isn't enough time to even evaluate something's ability to store value.  You've confused a speculative bubble with a store of value, your logic could be applied to all bubbles.  Stores of value MUST be evaluated over long terms or lenders can't lend.  Would you sign a 30 year mortgage denominated in Bitcoin?  When you understand why you wouldn't, you'll better understand what a store of value actually is.  Bitcoin isn't one, Bitcoin is a speculative investment, not a store of value.

Bitcoin does not forbid inflation, it's been inflating for 6 or 7 months now by the standard definition of inflation.  Inflation as the wider world uses it means the prices of goods, not the size of the money supply.

Yes, it will eventually stop money supply inflation, however the common meaning of the term inflation when used in economic discussions is not supply inflation, but price inflation of goods and services.  Inflation, the kind everyone cares about, happens regardless of the limits placed on the money supply due to changes in supply and demand for currency.  Bitcoin cannot prevent that kind of inflation and that's what is normally meant by the word. The word inflation unqualified, does not refer to the size of the money supply.

No not lies, simple logic.  The rich are lenders, inflation hurts lenders the most and helps borrowers by devaluing the currency they have to pay back.  The poor are certainly hurt as well since their paycheck's don't keep up, but you're simply wrong that it's them who are hurt the most, those with the most liquid capital and/or lenders are hurt the most.  Yes, those who keep their wealth in capital assets aren't hurt as much because surprise, they understand money and don't stay liquid.  Money is not for saving, it's for spending and lending, otherwise park wealth in assets which are how saving is done; people who get this aren't hurt by inflation.

Clearly you don't, and I'm a third party observer here.


If someone pays you in Bitcoin, that Bitcoin represents a debt owed to the holder for whatever labor or service he performed or item he sold to get that coin, that debt is collected upon when you spend that coin and receive something now for something you did when you earned the coin.  All money is debt.  He's not talking about the interest bearing borrowed kind of debt, he's talking about the higher level concepts that you expect to be able to spend your money and thus it is a debt you hold that you can collect upon by spending it.  It's a more efficient means of exchange than barter, and each bill represents a debt to be later paid by spending.  It's a perfectly accurate metaphor for what money is; all money.

@_date: 2015-01-25 06:02:48
The only thing you're doing is missing the point; we're talking about debt as a metaphor for all money, not about actual debt from borrowing and lending.  If you can't separate the two conversations, then you're not getting it.  This has zero to do with anything you said, do please reread what's being talked about and understand what's being said.  All money is debt, whether its gold, USD, or Bitcoin, that is the nature of money.  Gold is additionally a commodity, but its price has very little to do with its commodity value and everything to do with its monetary value and thus its value is still fiat.

I'll tell you what monied people do; they store their wealth in assets because they know money is a tool for transferring wealth, not a tool for holding wealth.

That's not what inflation means.

It ain't trouncing shit, the amount of capital in bitcoin is tiny compared to stocks and bonds; it's a small illiquid market with massive volatility in both directions. Whether going up or down, very little money is being lost or gained compared to stocks and bonds; it's an invalid comparison.

Yes it can, via demanding taxes in fiat; thus forcing the market to use its currency.

That's all I'm saying, I'm not talking about a managed economy.


I don't think will ever happen and there's no good reason to think it will.  I've been following bitcoin for many years, I'm not a newb.


No, they follow the most efficient legal business model and that they must pay taxes in fiat ensures that will always be the dominant currency the business operates in regardless of its efficiency. Bitcoin if used, will be little more than a payment system for them. It's far too unstable to hold for a business.

It's not about what one believes, it's simply about what the word refers to in general vs in a specific context like a small Austrian school community like Bitcoin. Regardless of which side you follow, it pays to know the words mean something different to the two schools.

Currencies are deeply related to national sovereignty, as long as there are countries, there will be fiat currencies and nothing like Bitcoin can ever replace them by force of law.

Bwahahahahahaha, that's funny, but not remotely likely. Consumers use credit cards for a reason: they can dispute the charges. Bitcoin isn't a win for them here, it's a risk.

99% of crypto currencies failed in history; both your statement and mine are meaningless.

@_date: 2018-03-07 23:06:58


That's a false dichotomy fallacy and thus invalid reasoning, there's a million reasons you'd sell at the bottom that don't involve panicking or trying to crash the asset not to mention that at the time of selling, you can't possibly know it's the bottom. So your faulty reasoning also suffers from the hindsight fallacy.

@_date: 2018-03-07 23:09:44


Unlikely, as the buy back would suffer major slippage as the price starting rising due to the lack of liquidity. Any order big enough to move the market when selling would also move it when buying; you're assuming no price move on the buy, that's the only way he could double up and that just wouldn't happen if his order size caused the crash.
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:15:13

That the economy exists is a function of law and of thus government; businesses rely on government to have a functioning economy and thus will always follow the rules and use the fiat of the government that manages said economy. Bitcoin cannot displace fiat, it'll merely be another commodity in the market. And should Bitcoin ever become a problem, governments can and will outlaw it and businesses and thus the economy will stop using it. Government can't destroy bitcoin, but they can quite easily make business avoid it entirely effectively making it of little relevance.

Selling low and buying is high is called trend following; it's a valid strategy in trendy markets, it'll kill you in a ranging market. Buying low and selling high will also kill you in a trending market but works great in a ranging market.  No matter what you do, it's bad in some normal market condition and good in others.
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:13:53
You can't buy a shitload at a crashed price without making the price recover while you're doing possibly losing money in the process, certainly not if it was your sales that caused the crash. You need to work slippage into your thinking when talking about orders big enough to crash a market.

You can use a wall to attempt to stop the price from moving and dry up liquidity below or above you wall, but it's risky as it makes you a target for other whales, there's nothing remotely risk free about it and it doesn't enable you to scoop up coins cheap unless you can dry up liquidity enough to both enable the pulling of the wall to drop the price and here's the key point, enough liquidity steps in at the new price that you can then buy without the price jumping back to where it was.  None of this is guaranteed, it only really works well when there's a single whale in the market, otherwise someone else huge is just going to eat your wall as liquidity to ensure a lack of slippage on their huge order in which case you're fucked.

Yea, to the vast majority of the planet, who aren't Austrians, inflation refers to the cost of goods in the currency, not to the supply level of the currency. When you use common terms in uncommon ways, you can expect general confusion to ensue.

Invalid comparison; business networks like Visa process what's necessary, they can increase capacity to any number they like but no business does more than they need.

No, they're avoiding fraud; they couldn't give a shit about LN.


Lol, no, they won't.


No, Visa and other networks will simply lower their fees, they charge as much as they do now because they can, not because they have to.


No, they don't, their value proposition is protecting consumers from fraud, which they do better than anything else and which Bitcoin/LN are not even competition.
You don't understand business very well, you're too enamored with "new" to have a realistic expectation of what's actually going to happen.  I'd guess you're young and overly idealistic, give it time, they're not going to be so easy to disrupt.

Volatility forever, stability isn't natural and doesn't just happen, it takes active supply management to make a currency stable, i.e. inflation.  Gold wasn't ever stable as a currency, it's why it was abandoned. Bitcoin cannot be stable, ever.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:54:30
People have been saying that for nearly a decade; it's not happening.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:48:51


Whoops, correct, I misspoke, but the point stands, price instability.


Firstly, it's not slow, wealth doesn't slowly grow, it fluctuates constantly; yes it grows slowly as a long term trend, but the short term and seasonal fluctuations matter much more.  The money supply needs to be elastic so it can be managed to keep the cost of goods stable.  If you can't manage the supply, the cost of goods would have to swing constantly and that's a huge problem.  Suppliers don't mind raising prices, they hate lowering them, prices are "sticky" and resist downward pressure while going up quite easily.  This is why "inflation" isn't so bad but "deflation" is terrible.
To put it simply, managing the money supply works, letting the market force prices up and down constantly because the money supply is fixed doesn't; we know this from history, it's why we have the system we have now and it's why we abandoned gold as money.  Fixed money supplies lead to wild swings in the markets causing depressions and booms; after moving to fiat where the supply could be managed, we've eliminated depressions, now the markets swing far more gently and we have bubbles and recessions rather than booms and depressions.  Fixed money supplies cause price instability and make markets work poorly.  This isn't theoretical, this is known history.  Bitcoin is attempting to revive a failed system, it won't work; that system failed for good reason, it was replaced for good reason, and the current fiat system is objectively vastly better.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:30:26
If you really want to undestand, stop looking at the supply of the currency and start looking at things priced in the currency.  Wealth...you know, "stuff", isn't fixed in supply, if I double the amount of stuff for sale in the maket and don't double the amount of money along with it, then the only possible response of the market is that all the stuff must double in price so more wealth can be traded using the same fixed amount of currency. 
The amount of wealth (aka stuff) in the world is not fixed in supply and cannot be. Price stability of stuff is achieved by actively managing the supply of money by increasing and decreasing the supply to appropriately match the amount of stuff it's representing, that's something we call the velocity of money.  Since bitcoin's supply cannot be managed, then stuff cannot be kept at the same price over time, it must fluctuate wildly, prices going up drastically anytime more stuff is created and dropping wildly anytime less stuff is created.  Inflation and deflation of the currency supply are how the prices put on stuff are held relatively constant over time.  Bitcoin can't do that and thus can't be a good currency.
If you want stable prices on goods, then you absolutely must be able to manipulate the money supply to keep the value of goods stable.  That's that's the purpose and role of inflation in the fiat system, it's why fiat works, it's why you can sign a 30 year loan on your house.  
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:59:22


Nope, it can't be stable, it's fixed in supply; those two things conflict.  Wealth is not fixed in supply, price stability in goods *requires* the ability to adjust the supply of a currency.  Bitcoin lacks this ability and will thus never achieve price stability.  It may totally reach 100k in value, but it'll never be stable, ever.
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:02:57


No, you need the ability to manipulate the supply, which you can't in bitcon.  You're mostly right, what  you're missing is that mass adoption achieves nothing, stability doesn't come from adoption, it comes from active management of supply.  Gold was never stable, it's why it was abandoned.  Wealth is not fixed in supply, therefore by definition the thing used to represent and trade wealth also cannot be fixed in supply, if it is fixed in supply, then prices must necessarily and unavoidably fluctuate drastically as the wealth it represents fluctuates.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:57:09


Close, stability means predictability, not lack of change. The dollar predictably inflates at a steady rate good enough to price loans out decades in advance.
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:55:35
I'm saying bitcoin can't and won't ever stabilize enough to be useful as a currency, it can't; nothing that's limited in supply makes good money.
