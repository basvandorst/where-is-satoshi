Thanks will def. check it out.

The arguments are strong on both sides of the same coin -- i.e.:
1) Authorities / regulators / "the man" will cite this as an example to throw the hammer down on cyber currencies like Bitcoin
2) If the alleged perpetrator did indeed receive BTC in exchange for leaking these photos and actually never gets caught or his identity remains anonymous, then this hammers home the power of BTC in a way that no other method of financial transacting could ever touch.

For the tech dummies out there like me.
If I am registered on bitcointalk, but haven't logged in over a week or so... am I ok? I'd rather not change the password if I don't have to, but if there is a chance that all of the passes are compromised, I guess I have to?

Woah, did I read correctly that the dude / gal that snaked your buddies bitcoins has a balance of 63,000 BTC?
Secondly, and sorry for the total noob question, but can't they put a freeze on that receivers account until this gets settled?

Isn't this kind of the reason why BTC is a bit of the "Wild West" and hasn't really caught on mainstream?
I mean, I'm no tech savant, but its all is a bit overwhelming to think about Hot Wallets, Cold Wallets, Hybrids, encryption, you almost need a Comp Sci degree to feel competent owning these things... and even then, people get ripped off... 
The real cynic in me feels like this is the hacker's paradise. People spend their hard earned money to buy BTCs and then hackers simply pick them off like digital snipers -- all in a day's work... cha-ching!...it's all very unsettling isn't it?

If you don't mind saying, what method do you use and which online wallet do you recommend?
Thanks!
