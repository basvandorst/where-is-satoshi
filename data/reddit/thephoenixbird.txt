Literally nothing, no value at all, they are a bunch of liars

People in Venezuela has been exchanging their savings into other currencies like Colombian Pesos (COP) or American Dollars (USD) since the laws and policies about currency exchange were changed into [a very strict, corrupt and limited process]( in 2003. So people is familiar with the concept of exchanging into other currency to "save money" as the local fiat Bolívar Fuerte started a rapid decline in value.
Now exchanging your savings into cryptocurrencies in order to escape hyperinflation will help just a few people at a great risk, and I say "a few" it's because Venezuelans are not used to digital currencies, and even digital bank transfers, local are wary of digital transfers because they can't touch it, transfers between different banks takes around 24h to confirm, and trusting in unknown people is hard to do nowadays, people prefer FIAT because it solves problems quickly on a fast changing environment. Also there is the issue with the technological gap, with the current inflation roaring 5650% owning a cheap chinese smartphone is a luxury for a lot of people, take into account that **the minimum wage in Venezuela is about USD$3.5**, people is starving because they can't even buy food with those low wages, neither a smartphone, or a computer, or any device connected to the internet. Thus this makes extremely difficult for someone to learn and get into technology, yet solutions like money transfers using SMS and a simple Android App were recently implemented by all major banks, instant confirmation, cheap fees, yet no ones use it, most common answer is: "I do not own a smartphone", "I ran out of data in my phone", "Only 1 out of 10 use it, why bother?" 
Then there is "the risk" as we all known, investing into crypto may incur in risks, loses, etc. It's a very volatile market, so, imagine people going into panic as they see their savings (which barely hold for buying food) take a 30% dip, or more... The other risks involved are about police corruption, arbitrary laws and a police state that doesn't like when people make money out of cheap electricity, several miners have been arrested just for having some equipment [[1]( [[4]( crazy criminal charges (even terrorism) are put on the heads to those people, in order to force them to make a decision **to give away their wallets or face 40 years of prison** in a heavily corrupted legal system. Then is the criminal risk, it's widely known that Venezuela, particularly it capital city [Caracas is the Most Dangerous City in the World]( on 2017 had 130.35 homicides per 100,000 residents. It's a popular misconception to believe that to hold a crypto-coin you must hold an unit, when in reality you can just trade with fractions of it, but in a country with low technology literacy, talking about Bitcoin may refer to thousands of dollars in the ears of the wrong people, thus making you a target for kidnapping and even worse...
Only a few people, less than 1% of population I might say, will take the risks involved and with the knowledge they can use cryptocorrencies as a way to get through these times .
But mass adoption of cryptocurrencies as a solution of these dire times is most certainly never going to happen.

Venezuelan here, tell your family to be cautious of whom they trade with on localbitcoin, it's been known that sometimes buyers tip the "bad people" and they knock on your door. Localbitcoin breaks your anonymity by exposing your details and we both know what people would do for money in Venezuela. Stay safe bro.

The only way I can see that cryptocurrencies can help the current state of Venezuela if a reform to adopt blockchain into the banking system and then include cryptos into the exchange systemm, just like South Korea is doing right now, regulation and adoption, so people could have an easy way to get their fiat into cryptos and then move it around, yet, the current govt have been blocking exchanges for more than a decade, so it's likely not going to happen, as the effort to educate and regain the people trust into a new digital system could cost millions of dollars in a 30million population country.
**IF** there is a change in the current govt it's more likely the dollarization of the economy, ditch the local fiat and adopt another currency more familiar to the people like the USD, [just like Ecuador did a few decades ago](

PETRO is a govt **SCAM**, those guys have no idea of how cryptocurrencies works and try to make their own, PETRO is more like a debt bond, that is why the [US Treasury Department issued a warning about it]( on the other hand [PETRO can't be mined, it will be sold only on auctions govt controlled]( there is no limit on how many can issued by the govt itself under their arbitrary terms, the only exchange legally allowed to sell/buy PETRO is the Venezuela Central Bank (govt controlled), and their claims that it's [backed by Oil Barrels]( is just ambiguous because it doesn't include the costs of extraction, refining, transport, etc... Venezuela is also producing less and less oil barrels per day due the collapse of the industry, and Chinese/Russian companies own the extraction rights of most of the oil deposits, also non-renewable fuel price is going to keep going down since new eco-alternatives are getting more and more popular and easy to obtain, then, on a long term, PETRO isn't profitable, in fact you could easily lose money if by 2020 big oil buyers start to change to solar/wind/nuclear power.
Idiots are signing in blindly, because they are used to get stuff for free, or almost free (yay socialism!), but they have no idea of what is coming for them. They are probably going to be used, if they ever mine BTC/ETH they will be forced to exchange those into PETRO for "patriotic reasons" because all other cryptos will be illegal. Just in the last year they jailed a lot of Venezuelans mining bitcoin [[1]( [[4]( because if there is no laws allowing it, then its illegal (yeah, that is how law works here...)
