Where not talking about "doing business" here. We're talking about a place where you store currency. Weather or not NiceHash functions exactly like a regular bank does, doesn't really matter either. The point is bitcoin is risky and the "banks" your store it in (assuming you aren't using an offline wallet) are even riskier, because it's not insured.

not a FDIC bank

The overwhelming majority of items sold were illegal. You cannot dispute this.


The website had labeled sections. These were not automatically generated. The website designer specifically created these sections and labels.

Ever wonder why the market on an anonymous darkweb site demanded overwhelmingly the sale of illegal substances? What does libertarian-ism have to do with drugs? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:27:26
You're saying that the marketplace was created for libertarians to buy and sell anything and that it was pure coincidence that 95% of what was sold there was drugs. I'm saying that's BS.

Exactly. That's the extent of the relation between libertarians and drugs. Libertarians think that drugs, among other things, should be legal to use. That's it. Drug use and libertarian-ism aren't directly related beyond their belief on its use. So why was a libertarian market place overwhelmingly used to sell drugs? Why was the silk road known as a drug website? If it was all about just being a libertarian marketplace why did the market solely dictate that drugs would be by far the most popular product if being a libertarian is not inherently related to drug use?

I know exactly how they feel about it. It's clear that they believe it shouldn't be illegal, but is it an integral part of being a libertarian? Are all libertarians drug users? Does libertarian-ism revolve around drug use? Do you have to use drugs to be a libertarian?

It doesn't matter if the things hurt people or not. You said it wasn't designed to do something illegal, which is false. 90% of the things sold there were illegal and the website was specifically designed with labeled sections that catered to those things. You cannot claim that it wasn't designed to do something illegal.

"Your honor, I didn't break the law because I don't believe in it."

You didn't answer my questions at all. You just dodged my point completely.The SilkRoad may have had its roots in libertarian perspectives, but it was 100% designed as a marketplace for drugs and other illicit products.

It doesn't matter what your values are. You can not care about the law, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist, or that you can claim ignorance when you decide to break it.

What does that have to do with saying that the silk road wasn't made to do illegal things.
