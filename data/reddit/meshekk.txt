@_date: 2015-08-20 14:22:42
This Gavin is kind like Jaksoon Palmer
Jaksoon with the braceyourself NeuCoin and dang meme instead of doge.
And Gavin with XT coin friends because both didnt feet to the community,remember what was last words from the Jacksoon Palmer about Dogecoin he was calling the community racist,thats why you got censored on ideas that dont feet in there agenda.
Many have tryed to replicate bitcoin but nobody have came closer to Satoshi protocol only one coin had succes of what bitcoin has and the name is LTC

why sad?Jamie is representing thieves,JPMorgan Chase Mafia with the help of IOR (Institute for the Works of Religion) they are laundering tones of money.
wikipedia source:In September 2010, Italian magistrates seized €23 million from the IOR, on the grounds that the anti-money laundering laws in force had been violated. The money was originally to be transferred from the Italian Credito Artigiano to JPMorgan Chase and another Italian bank, Banca del Fucino.[40][41] Both the origin and destination of the funds were accounts under the control of the IOR.
