ok, calling it day1 is too much IMO since it's more like half a day; but I do see they advertised it as starting on Apr 11

I think you mean their spread is thinner

That makes sense.  Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2014-09-22 04:32:25
Do they already have a/b testing?  It sounds obvious to have, but it does take some work/investment on their side.

seems promising.  Is this from Stripe?
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:51:10
Exactly. I wonder if there will ever be a time when this will be the understanding of most people. Perhaps btc will be completely behind the scenes when it's adopted by the masses.

Cameron, will Wall St just keep buying BTC OTC? If so, how long do you think it will take? Or if they don't, how will they take positions in BTC?
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:27:32
Sidechains might help; plenty of infrastructure still needs to be built and attempts at decentralized DNS will get better.

 Are you talking about the round2 videos of marketing fluff?

maybe it's somehow part of the reason why there's "cheap"er coins right now?

Exactly. This is more accurate than the parent.

@_date: 2014-10-06 04:53:57
So is this how Wall St would get into btc?  I know they've been buying off-chain, but maybe that's too slow?
If this isn't how they would do it, anyone have experience on the street about how they would?

When explaining a DAO, describe a small one first, before larger ones, since that's the way they'll probably happen.  eg clubs-&gt;non-profits-&gt;corporations
eg imagine a club where the code collects member fees and pays the bills.  There would be no need for a treasure that could possibly siphon funds from the club.  Things are open source, so everyone can see that members contributed their fees and bills were paid, etc.  The code contains the rules of the club.  So if there is a proposal to change member fees, it has to receive consensus of the people, by people updating their software.  There is no president or board that can unilaterally change the rules of the club for their own interests, instead of the interests of members.

Agree that's how it should be done.  But they should also have a testnet.  Anyone know if they have?

Thanks for this and the other explanations.


Do you mean that the 2nd tx will return min dust *from* their account (to Coinbase) ?
(The way it's phrased right now, it seems that the user is getting min dust twice, and Coinbase is giving min dust twice.)
