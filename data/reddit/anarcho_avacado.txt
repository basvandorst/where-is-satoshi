Bitcoin just like Bitcoin Cash is not considered a security. So this is not insider trading.

Separate issue. Pathological hodling will ruin industry 
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:56:51
why does the price of bitcoin go up?

Samson and Song are completely wrong in trying to create a Austrian economics analogy. Using this terminology is completely backwards. When using the real definition of "Austrian Economics", the people ascribing to the point of view would want both store of value and medium of exchange. Read Mises.

tell me what a second layer solution is
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:51:54
You were so brave to post that bravo
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:08:08
- why does the price go up?
- why do people want to use it?

Automatic recurring replace buys at Coinbase for ~2% fee. If you somehow rationalize this being as a burdensome cost you've gone too far turn back

Anyone that has pathological hodling syndrome plz see below:

If you're a cruise goer, I highly recommend contra cruise with Bob and Tom
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:01:09
why do they want it?
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:55:37
- You said the cost is so high (cry.jpeg)
- I said the cost really isn't that bad (btfo.jpeg)
- You said this thing is cheaper (simpsonshaha.png)
- I never said it's cheaper than thing, I said it's cheap
- You: (smugrickandmorty.jpeg)
- *under your hodl paradigm the price doesn't go up because there is no activity on it*
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:09:47
you've past the test
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:27:19
Why do you even bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:27:41
would gold have become a store of value if no one accepted it?

- buy bitcoin at price X, number of users Y, and market size Z
- spend bitcoin to get number of users to Y+1, which increases market size to (Y+1)^2 = Z ... Metcalfs law
- bitcoin price X2 &gt; X1
Spending crypto increases the market of crypto increasing the price of crypto.
Imagine a social media service that had a bunch of static accounts that never liked, messaged, and shared any content between them...how valuable would that company be in the long run?

I’m talking about off chain exchanges...bud. Surprised you allowed this much precious time to be wasted
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:48:03
my equation was illustrative not exact. But yes you've proved my point...now imagine if thousands of people did that

your central banking boomerist financial paradigm is wrong...stop complaining just deal with it 
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:58:57
you can do it every week or month. similar to how most people get a paycheck not every time they spend money from the last paycheck
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:25:16
this guy gets it
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:08:18
Fees are taken because they provide a service not because they are capitalist oligarchs stealing from you. You replenish it because people that understand the ramifications of it want to convert the entire system to crypto. This isn’t a beanie baby for you sell at a future time...bud.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:15:30
Yes there is risk and that’s why big return ...

how do you walk around with that big brain of yours?

5 min to set up recurring buys at 2% on Coinbase. Wrong!

- bch argument: only those with the economic incentive to run a full node will run a full node. Auditor businesses would be employed by users to validate, placing a check on miners.
- your distortion of it: jihan is the only person allowed to run node
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:42:56
To all the hodlers out there....you are willing to take the risk getting crypto, holding crypto, and waiting in uncertain regulatory environment....but somehow 5 min of your time and 2% fee is unbearable?

So you are advocating forced centralization of cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:45:38
because you are making 1000s% return on crypto
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:22:28
did you just assume my clade?
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:48:56
no when you replenish your crypto not on every tx 
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:46:38
this might come as a shock but users are part of the crypto economy and your actions effect the price.
