The EU is saying - this whole shit is coming down, we are placing this framework up to facilitate our golden parachutes.

Nash Equilibrium:  "Informally, a set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy."
First of all, it is almost impossible to formally define the context of how this phrase can be used.  See the following short example:
It's a poorly defined, theoretical idea that doesn't really differentiate between a sentient opponent or something derived from random entropy of the universe.
My real world use case scenario of the word is when two nations participate in international trade.  Each nation will participate in currency wars, devaluing to export, etc, to gain advantage.  The side on the losing end of trade would eventually demand a common unit of account to fulfill the use case scenario I suggested of an "economic nash equilibrium".
In math, the term seems to always be used in primitive, closed systems with all externalities removed, making it extremely difficult to use in any real life scenario.

Wow, got to be fucking kidding me.  The post was deleted by overclock.net forum moderators when it's just a post about economics:

There is a minimum transaction fee, it's set to 0.  Litecoin for instance is 0.001

If David Cameron approves of Bitcoin it's definitely a trojan horse to try and trick people into a digital, cashless only society.  We have not passed a SINGLE litmus test for Bitcoin being some kind of force for good.  Even Ben Bernanke likes it.  It seems like there's not a single evil financier or tyrant that doesn't love it.  I'm sure George Soros will come out any day telling us to stock up on some Ethereums and that you're doing god's work by abolishing cash and staying away from those evil previous metals.

So you're saying we don't have a debt based scam monetary system?  FAKE NEWS SAD.

According to my napkin math, Bitcoin needs to get to around 5000 TPS in order to not be a settlement layer, so any talk of on-chain scaling is nonsense if you can't get numbers like that.

So $236,000 and no metals?  You better hope Bitcoin works out or net worth is going to be 0.

Vinny is flat out wrong.  Bitcoin can never compete with silver or gold as an actual store of value:
And why Bitcoin does not have value as a settlement layer:
People don't want to hear it but the only logical move in a theoretical scenario where you believe the market cap of both bitcoin and metals has peaked, is to then dump all your bitcoin for metals since they're more anti-fragile, more fungible, and less counter party risk.  That's just the way it is and bitcoin can't defeat metals on Exter's pyramid.  It's completely impossible.
The saying that "gold (and silver) are money and everything else is credit/debt" is true.  Fiat can default if your sovereign invalidates the bills, prints too many etc.  Bitcoin can default if it stops working for whatever reason.  Metals can't default because they exist as more than a concept.
Yes, you can make money in bitcoin, but let's not flat out lie and claim bitcoin somehow makes metals obsolete when bitcoin is clearly inferior to metals in it's main aspects people seek for wealth preservation.  My second link also shows why Roger Ver is wrong and Bitcoin would likely need something like the LN to have any value proposition.

Hi, r0ach from the internet here.  While attempting to calculate how many atoms are in the door handle of a refrigerator, I think Gmaxwell forgot that Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency.  A currency without widespread distribution is useless, it's called NXT.
Widespread distribution doesn't occur as long as ASIC mining exists for several reasons:
1)  The public views Bitcoin as a zero sum game, where the act of purchasing coins from some guy (ASIC mining pool) is the act of making someone else rich at your own expense.
2)  Bitcoin with ASIC has a high barrier of entry without any real immediate reward.  You're either required to become a high powered industrial miner or an institutional investor.  The hobbyist or general human is excluded entirely.  You have teenage girls with laptops that own Dogecoins.  You won't see many of those, if any, in Bitcoin.
3)  Since there is, in reality, not much if any reason for the public to switch from fiat to Bitcoin, the only possible way a widespread distribution would occur at all is from hobbyists using general purpose hardware.  It's kind of an ominus warning flag when you have Bitcoin devs themselves who can't buy ASICs without being scammed of 100btc.
4)  The one plausible scenario Bitcoin would reach widespread distribution is due to full blown economic meltdown.  This is why I say Bitcoin is backed by the odds of financial collapse occuring at any given time.  Now that's what I call high barrier of entry.  You need to implode the entire world economy for it to become useful.
