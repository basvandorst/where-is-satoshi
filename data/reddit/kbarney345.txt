Ah so it's not technically the btc that's lost but access and use that's lost ?
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:58:22
Is this the case for alt coins as well or only btc? Can this be changed in anyway or is this a part of block Chains themself?

Thanks for explaining so easily, so in that case what prevents us from moving it exactly I know we don't have the seed but there's not a single other way to access them?

So if we do have that information we can recover the btc any where ?  Sorry I don't know a whole lot

So once a bit coin is created and traded that's it if I put it on a hdd then throw it in a river it's just gone to never be seen again ever ??

Isn't that a major flaw then? Or am I thinking to simply. Im.looking at this like a password for an email without any recovery options

That's what happens when you flood a market with loads of crap for a quick cash grab. There was massive general interest in crypto and it was actually gaining very much need attention by corporations and governments. Then the alts started blowing up, people losing money, no ability to cash out, currency swaps not going through and people having thousands of dollars disappear. This turns into massive negative press and bitcoin being the eye of everyone it's performance doubles down the issue. Now people on the outside thing cyrptos dying or a scam or just something stupid that will fade into oblivion. This is obviously far from the truth and blockchains
 potential is still huge but now investors arent confident like they use to be so the markets falling more and more.

See by your comment I realize I know even less than I thought and I guess I'm a still missing some things. Seeing as you favor bit would you mind telling me some of your experience with it ? What you think of its future?

Thanks! You've guys given me some great advice, I didn't know enough to counter his argument properly.

I started over at etherium* after seeing some guys post about mining it and wondering if my laptop could mine since it just sits all day. It really interest me and I'd like to get into more but I'm really not sure where to start. I'm also afraid I don't have the needed capital to start so again here I am.

I was talking to my buddy recently and asked him what he thought of crypto because I was thinking of learning more about it. His argument said it was a bad idea because there is no physical backing to either through government or physical value such as gold. I don't know enough and was wondering what you guys have to say. He thinks this is going to pop and it's no different from stock trading.
