Glad someone else said it. Should be called Toolpool.

They changed their mind quick.

What's up with that guy? He's like a bitcoin bashing machine.

Dear Google,
Please incorporate bitcoin somehow anyhow so it goes to da moon.

Had to be.

This is awesome I need my gas stations to accept bitcoin now.
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:04:30
Cool table thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:25:54
Bunch if you search Google but not sure who I would trust.
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:25:32
My glands thank him as well.

It's a pretty good idea. Lots of people get Starbucks cards as gifts. This service lets you turn that into an investment if you hold the coins. I think this could be the beginning of a large niche turning "cards into coins".

The sky is falling!!!

Thanks for the feedback but I don't think that's the problem. I'm in the U.S, wired USD from a U.S bank. I called my bank last night and she traced the wire, said everything is good and the money has been sitting in their account since 8:59 AM.
I don't think anything shady is happening, I just think something got mixed up along the way. It sucks because I wanted to take advantage of the price swing yesterday.

I've spent almost 6 figures with Coinbase. Did a 15K wire a couple days ago and it's MIA, no response from support. Just tried to make a purchase using my bank account and it says upload photo ID which has already been done....

You're probably correct about the AML checks. I paid to have a same day wire though to snatch up those 1000ish coins... Lesson learned to keep more $ in account on reserve!
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:24:31
Is someone actually going to reply to my email? This isn't a couple hundred dollars.
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:01:16
Thanks for the comments. This was a domestic same day wire ($30 extra ouch!) but I'm sure it's an innocent mix up.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:12:14
Been there since 2013 as well, so just as long as you were. Very disappointing really seems to be going downhill.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:58:02
LMAO you clown
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:00:20
Thanks for the quick reply, just sent you an email.

I spoke to 3 pool owners a couple days ago. They plan on activating just waiting for the man power. I'm all about Bitcoin but had to get on the Litecoin train because it's getting interesting.
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:11:05
Right inside your *GDAX account just like Bitcoin.
Yes GDAX, you guys are correct.
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:00:06
I've never been a fan of litecoin but the last couple weeks has flipped me. Still have my entire bitcoin investment but I bought into litecoin as well. If litecoin gets full segwit integration which it appears will happen, not only will the price take off it will show what potential affect it could have on bitcoin :)
I've personally spoken to pool owners not currently supporting segwit and all three intend to. They are just waiting for enough man power to do so.
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:30:35
Sorry brain-fart, GDAX which is Coinbases trading platform.
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:23:06
Poloniex = Pumpers Paradise
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:03:40
Not so sure I would do that just yet.
