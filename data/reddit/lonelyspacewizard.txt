And the US will call-in its debts and those countries will be boned.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:14:09
Point is if it was called in due to china it would be a global issue.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:32
Starting to wonder if we should ask when CB is UP.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:00:54
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:12:47
It's not, one clearly says cash. Are you 5?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:50:21
Still hanging on mommy's coattails I see.

THey may be trying to stabilize/improve the backend after the outage they have before from a huge spike last week.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:16:41
Because that is what I still have to use to pay my mortgage, car note, and other things. Until I can start phasing more of those over to BTC payments, $$$ is what will in the end matter more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:34
Oh look, the price is normal again for when trades start.. who would have thought... dick.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:35
Afford to loose and want to loose are two different things.
EDIT: I'm leaving the mistake due to the shame of doing it twice!
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:20:37
You're going to end up losing like 30% of that to taxes, and I personally gained 16% on my 401K this year. That's not bad.
Are you comfortable not having any of that money in the event BTC does end up a flop 20yrs from now? That is the risk you are taking.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:36:38
When is go live time? Ive not found it? I assume someplace from 8-10am EST?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:40:00
He probably purchased using a credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:19
Apparently there are like 40 conspiracy's a day there. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:57:44
Are they confusing Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:38
At least use the term correctly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:51
You're assuming the issue also isn't just a technical one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:51:03
ditching mine fast as I can.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:39:04
I hope it stays high so i can sell it for more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:07
I'm not disagreeing with that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:49
This sub has more conspiracy nuts than @_date: 2017-12-12 15:30:59
When I started at my job I was the only one. Now we are up to 6 of us that I know of. It's really catching on.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:13
Bittrex didn't JUST add bch and isn't known for stability issues like CB is. Also btc and bch trading is unrelated. People due their BCH from the split haven't even all gotten it. It's not some weird plan, it's just a fuck-up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:52
because the sites fucked up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:45
I think its due to thousands of coins being added showing as buys. they have sales locked so no ones actually getting these prices.
This sub loves to flip out for no reason and everything is always a conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:42:59
If you watch on Bitcoin wisdom you will see big sells that seem to be keeping the price down when it gets to high.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:10
I'm not shilling for anyone.  I'm just not a fucking idiot like 80% of this sub seems to be tonight. Why are YOU acting like a fucking nut job? GDAX and CB are fucked sites from the added load, and apparently here instability = planned evil plot.
Sometimes being inept is JUST being inept.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:48:32
I agree on both counts, but the amount of paranoia here is at dangerous levels sometimes. It reminds me of 4chan or that Trump sub at times.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:22:57
Nearly every coin he promotes has a large price jump just after. My friends started to make money just by following him, investing soon as he tweets then pulling out after it starts to jump.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:38
CB is gdax
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:54:56
I'm more interested in when we will see 19k again.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:04:50
Mac basicly is Linux (unix) so the linux guide should work in some form.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:58:54
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:50:19
I sold at 6300 and rebought at 5700.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:55:12
When will we get to the Slack, Skype and FaceBook Messenger of cyptocurrenty? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:32:19
holy shit this is asked like 10 times a day in this sub, just search.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:05:13
A name change isnt going to change how many coins you have.
If you got a Mustang and a F-150 and they changed the names you'd still have 1 of each.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:49:39
Every dip under 6220 I've been making a buy.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:04:32
8k? Highest I saw was 7988.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:22:53
Always hold, it always comes back up, maybe return slowly, but it does.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:58:17
GPU is basically pointless now. Even with free power you'll make only pennies.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:57:40
I don't see how these contradict.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:46:52
No GPU is good for mining anymore. You have to get a dedicated mining machine to make any kind of profit even if your power is very cheap
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:55:06
I have a few litecoin
