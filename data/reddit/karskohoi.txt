The question is how do you secure a sidechain? With miners? How do you pay these miners for their service?
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:53:05
See and learn:
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:12:34
People will not have a pegged token on an insecure system. They prefer to hold bitcoin within the security model of Bitcoin and the blockchain. Who will pay to secure these sidechains and who will secure Bitcoin when fees are moved off chain? If Bitcoin can not provide block space for a reasonable price, some altcoin will. The only thing Bitcoin has going for it is the network effect, and when that is gone it will be just another shitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-20 02:47:03
A transaction of actual value. Not a demo. Don't get me wrong. I love OT, but we still need to increase the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:34:27
This is false. Bitcoin must be developed with the focus on keeping the network effect. Without it Bitcoin would just be another shitcoin and it will become that if we keep small blocks.

That's all you 1MB blockers have. No numbers, just "deep assumptions".
@_date: 2015-12-20 02:24:23


This is the key word. Still not operational.
@_date: 2015-12-20 02:30:07
Have you heard about a person actually doing a legitimate transaction via OT?
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:21:23
Bitcoin's "Metcalfe's Law" relationship between market cap and the square of the number of transactions
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:44:08
Indeed. We need to fork Bitcoin into a small blocks and a big blocks chain, and then let the market decide which chain has most value.
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:53:47
Good thing that we wont see 8GB blocks until 2036 then.
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:50:38
This is the problem with many Bitcoin Core devs. They know nothing about game theory and economy.
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:26:08
Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:35:50
The value of bitcoin will not go up much with 1MB blocks. Probably just one more bubble with 1MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:03:03
The money will flow into the coin with the network effect. HODLers of bitcoin will lose their shirts if another coin dethrones bitcoin. This will happen if the blocksize stays at 1MB.
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:32:52
Nothing balanced to see here.
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:42:31
So you think that a currency that can do 3 transactions per second can be a global currency?
@_date: 2015-12-24 22:51:07
This is false and I'm not negative. I think that the market will bypass the central planners in Blockstream. Blocksize should be determined by the decentralized network of miners and not by some special interest.
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:11:03
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:19:19
Enjoy :)
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:15:45
Yes, I'm also confident that the network will adopt BIP101 :)
@_date: 2015-12-20 00:30:39
Will be interesting to see the major drop when we crash and burn hitting 1MB...
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:55:07
The problem with many Bitcoin Core devs is that they know nothing about game theory and economy. Why should we trust people that do not know what a hedge is to enforce economical policies on the Bitcoin network?
@_date: 2015-12-20 02:11:50
Payment channels are settled on the blockchain. Open Transactions is semi-centralized and vaporware. Physical coins are not safe and easy to transact in.
@_date: 2015-12-24 23:06:28
Yes. I covered that here:


@_date: 2015-12-19 23:48:47
A compromise in the blocksize debacle is like all-season tires. You will get both bad summer tires and bad winter tires. It is time to fork and let the market decide which fork has value.
@_date: 2015-12-20 02:20:08


Can you do a OT transaction today? If not it is vaporware.
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:49:04
It can not. You just don't understand the economical principles at play. By the way, I have several commits to Bitcoin Core, so I know a thing or two about technology.
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:34:37
Yes. He is probably referring to this old article:
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:11:09
957 people own 50 % of the bitcoins. So bitcoin is already alot more fair than the current system. According to a report from Oxfam last year, the richest 85 people across the globe now share a combined wealth which is as big as the wealth of the poorest 3.5 billion of the world's population.
@_date: 2015-12-20 02:01:52
Nope. If you want to do it in a decentralized way you are stuck with 3 transactions per second.
@_date: 2015-12-20 02:54:42
So it's not working yet. Sounds like vaporware to me...
@_date: 2015-06-24 03:46:46
Yes. No change to Bitcoin is impossible. I and some people can do a fork of Bitcoin with hyperinflation. Our problem is that people will most likely not migrate to our fork since they would like to keep their purchasing power. I'm pretty sure that the market will prefere BitcoinXT over old Bitcoin. If possible I would try to sell my old bitcoin for more bitcoinXT. The market will choose a winner pretty fast. If you do not want to speculate, just sit still until your coins on one chain are worthless and the coins on the other chain are worth the same as bitcoin pre fork.
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:39:55
I think that the professor misses the point of why Bitcoin is outside the banking system. Most Bitcoiners have no problem with banks getting involved in Bitcoin, because Bitcoin removes the banks power over the money supply. Anyone is also free to use Bitcoin without banks.
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:23:06
I think that we have been lagging behind because the market is pricing in the risk that the blocksize limit will not be raised.
@_date: 2015-12-24 20:53:15
Yes, and there will not be much incentive for the miners to mine a 1MB chain. We need a lot of transaction fees to secure the network by then.
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:51:39
Yes, through a centralized service like Coinbase. Personally I prefer decentralized commerce.
@_date: 2015-12-01 01:16:46
Bitcoin is not governed by Blockstream Core. They will understand this when the BIP101 fork happens.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:11:02
Do you disagree with the fact that the network effect is Bitcoin's most important property?
@_date: 2015-12-07 04:36:14
You can start advocating for BIP101.
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:55:50
I rather crash and burn at 1MB than run a node supporting BIP202.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:57:22
Last time I checked it was open-source, so it should be possible to change some limits with new code.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:47:29
Why do you have your money in bitcoin then? There are other coins that are much more decentralized than bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:25:00
This has been debated for years. Now it is time for the economic majority to implement what they want and that is BIP101.
@_date: 2015-12-20 00:08:32
Yes, looks like it gone up a lot since XT was announced.
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:08:35
The network can just lower the difficulty with a hard fork.
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:06:05
I agree with this:
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:24:47
This is just the start if we don't increase the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-01-01 21:42:18
And then we rinse and repeat next year? No thanks.
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:19:49
If you don't want RBF you must not run Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 when it is released.

So true.

Seems like the ivory tower has an environment of intellectual pursuit disconnected from the practical concerns of everyday life.
@_date: 2016-01-29 14:11:14


Yes, Bitcoin must be developed with the focus on keeping the network effect. Without it Bitcoin would just be another shitcoin and it will become that if we keep small blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:20:30
Andreas is right again and I don't think it is a coincidence he mentioned Classic first :) 
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:02:42
Did you read this in your link?


@_date: 2016-01-20 06:34:21
Is a tiny amount saved in fees enough to get all the ATMs, wallets and so forth to update their software? And don't get me started on if the actual users will implement the updates within two years. Do you know that Andreas Antonopoulos still pays his rent by physically writing a paper check?

@_date: 2016-01-01 20:28:47
@_date: 2016-01-01 21:57:24
...by a miniscule amount.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:38:53
It is a lot more worrying to stay at 1MB.
@_date: 2016-01-22 23:22:10
Seems like the ivory tower has an environment of intellectual pursuit disconnected from the practical concerns of everyday life.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:45:54
Yes, segwit can be rolled out faster than two years. What I meant was that for 1.6MB effective blocksize to be a reality, all transactions happening in the network must be new segwit transactions after the update. You can still send old transactions. Will you be sending segwit transactions from day one?
@_date: 2016-01-01 21:26:17
Since the blockstreamers fight tooth and nail to keep 1MB I'm sure they will do the same with the next crossroad. We need to solve this once and for all, so we can avoid often recurring fights like this. We should adopt BIP101 and spend our efforts on improving Bitcoin instead of fighting.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:31:34
All people that hold bitcoin will profit if full nodes become increasingly expensive to run due to more transactions happening. This is because a currency with more economic activity happening will have a larger market cap. You can run a node on a Raspberry Pi today, so it is not like it cost a fortune to run a node.
@_date: 2016-01-20 06:35:14
There are no evil forks.
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:51:37
No one can afford to not be a part of majority consensus.
@_date: 2016-01-01 20:31:42


Radical indeed.
@_date: 2016-01-20 05:56:24
Yes and a hardfork to 2MB will show people that all the scaremongering from the Core devs is just FUD.
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:49:53
Nodes will relay and mine RBF transactions by default in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0. This will affect all users and wallets. Peter Todd has basically destroyed bitcoin's ability to be used in retail situations like digital and face-to-face sales.
@_date: 2016-01-22 23:51:59
And what was Satoshi's vision for the blocksize?
@_date: 2016-01-01 18:50:13
It's very clear. That's the problem.
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:19:31
If you don't want RBF you must not run Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 when it is released.
@_date: 2016-01-22 23:48:12
Already done that.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:21:28
Yes, at a later stage. 1.6MB assumes that everyone is doing segwit transactions, which is assuming way to much in a shorter time frame than two years.
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:01:12
You will find out that you are not the breadwinner in that relationship.
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:20:57
So why has the hash rate just gone up the latest days? August is soon over...
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:21:07
Illicit markets are not economically significant. This was proven by the market when Silk Road was shut down in 2013. First price action was down, but a short time afterwards the price shot up because the market discovered that it was not a major part of the economy.
@_date: 2015-08-28 11:08:47
Now he just have to remove the 32MB max limit.

@_date: 2015-08-27 00:52:21
Yes, that article is incorrect.

Yes Master. Thank you Master.

XT is not an altcoin.

Regulators giving CPR? I thought they gave the death blow... :D
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:09:10
So if XT has the majority consensus, then Core is an altcoin? I think not.
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:08:06
Yes, if XT reaches 75 % then it is all over for Core. No rational miner will go against majority consensus and they will all switch over to XT before the two weeks grace period. Because of this Core will have a huge discrepancy between difficulty and hashing power after the fork has happened. This makes me pretty sure we will see at most five blocks from Core before it dies after the fork.
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:38:32
If Bitcoin splits 50-50, then the market will soon choose a winner. I think you small blockers fear that, and use the term altcoin to paint XT in a negative light due to the association many bitcoiners get hearing the term.

So miners should fill the block with spam if they do not have enough real transactions to fill the block with?
EDIT: Sorry. Now I see that you meant max size within that range and not block size within that range.

Come on! No one should be cut out of this discussion. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:14:52
When the block reward goes down we need a lot of transactions and fees to reward the miners. It is not a good idea to bypass the fee to the miners with centralized layers on top of the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:07:51
One major argument for BIP101.
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:26:18
Good stuff :)
@_date: 2015-09-12 12:21:54
Very informative debate :)
@_date: 2015-09-01 17:51:29
BIP101 is what we need. Lets merge that into Bitcoin Core.

Video of the talk:
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:09:30
Yes, BIP101 is the way to go :)
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:52:54
I said that we need a lot of fees, not high fees...
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:14:59
Yeah, and how would this not be a nightmare in a retail situation?
@_date: 2015-11-29 01:56:14
0-conf transactions have not always been 100% insecure, just ask any merchant, but with RBF they will.
@_date: 2015-11-29 20:53:54
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:40:08
Well, this is a pull in Blockstream Core. Should be pretty obvious...
@_date: 2015-09-16 19:43:07
A bit more than that:
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:46:59
Brian Armstrong does not have a dictatorial approach to this debate. Every node in the network can do whatever they want. Bitcoin is an open network.
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:45:30
Cutting people out is not a solution. Who is deciding who to cut out? You? There is no point in discussing anything before we agree that censorship is not the way forward. In the meantime I run and mine with XT.
@_date: 2015-11-29 21:45:34
You first.
@_date: 2015-11-29 03:45:29
The pull is for RBF by default.
@_date: 2015-11-08 15:14:51
I think first-mover advantage and the network effect are Bitcoin's most important differentiating properties. Without these properties Bitcoin would just be another shittcoin and it will become that if we keep small blocks.
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:01:07
Default is opt-in!
@_date: 2015-11-29 03:36:49
This is not about wallets. It is about what nodes relay on the network.
@_date: 2015-11-30 11:35:08
They run their policy over there.
@_date: 2015-11-30 11:17:27
Good news. Time to leave Blockstream Core.
@_date: 2015-11-30 11:05:03
How wonderfully secure the blockchain will be with starving miners and small blocks. People should stop running Blockstream Core. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 12:03:58
Sounds like you are in the US with shitty internet. "Fair use policies" sounds like some American corporate bullshit. The rest of the world don't get hassled with that stuff.

...and a lot of people commenting on the pull did support it. Many of them Blockstreamers.

Very nice :)
@_date: 2015-11-29 20:44:34
If Adam Back is such a genius, then why did he decline Satoshi's invitation to participate in the beginning? Should be easy to see the potential with his background. Instead he has come into Bitcoin just lately and is pushing his ideas onto this system which he does not understand.

You are right. My mistake. I run the XT-client myself.
@_date: 2015-11-29 20:22:53
Very good explanation of RBF. Blockstream seems hell-bent on destroying Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:00:57
If bitcoin is going to last long term we need to reward the miners with fees or permanent inflation of the coin supply. Personally I prefer fees, and then we need very large blocks so that the fee is within the bounds of what people are willing to pay.

@_date: 2015-11-30 11:22:47
When the inflation goes down we need a lot of transactions to support the miners. BIP102 and BIP103 will not secure the blockchain because of starving miners and small blocks.

@_date: 2015-11-29 03:06:18
The reason people are enraged is because the 1MB developers are pushing RBF so bitcoin can not be used at point of sale with 0-conf transactions. This will reduce the utility of bitcoin, and less use means less fees for Blockstream's "settlement transactions".
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:33:37
100 000 merchants are relying on 0-conf transactions today. You want to take that away from them.
@_date: 2015-11-06 22:10:32
As I said, Bitcoin is an open network. He is just saying what Coinbase are going to do, and that he hopes the rest of the network will follow.
