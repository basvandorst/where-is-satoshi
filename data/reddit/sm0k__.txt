Should create a bitchcoin fork 
@_date: 2017-09-19 08:55:08
Except that you will need a wallet to use your coins at some point...
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:58:00

The fee you used is way too low. You will have to wait or make a CPFP payement to compensate the fee 
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:43:42
Blockchain.info cant do a single thing for you. They don't control the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:52:12
OP, im pretty sure you'll never see these coins again. Good luck anyway, sorry for ya
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:27:18
Money in chinese I guess 
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:34:23
Just look at the sat per bytes used in recent tx compared to yours. Fees are more and more expensive these days 
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:25:21
Web based wallet are not secure... 
@_date: 2017-05-14 11:39:39
Hi, what is it about ? Congrats anyway

You can buy coins on many websites ( kraken, changelly...). You can use your trezor to send/receive btc eth or dash
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:36:45
No thanks, Im using trezor, a real secure wallet. As an IT security guy, I have 0 trust in Web browsers, and im right.
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:59:20
Shakepay, AdvCash, and many others
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:15:22
Think about compromised browsers 
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:11:40
Yeaaah maybe when we'll be all dead. Fiat will be used again for decades !

I think your wallet is buggy,  try to export your privkey and switch to something else
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:00:10
Im pretty sure its impossible. Cold storage wallet are not different from "classic" connected wallets. They are both not anything more than privkeys.
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:31:21
Yes
