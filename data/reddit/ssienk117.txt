The real MVP right here guys.

Thanks for the response. I’ve been holding back so far, because of a lot of the complications and limitations that you’ve listed.  I just want one hardware wallet that I can store all of my coins on, but it seems all them can hold at most four coins and requires browsers and all kinds of software. Maybe a mobile wallet is still my best option for now.

I mean, anything is possible in Crypto, but in my experience it typically means 1 of two things: either we are right on a resistance line and it’s bouncing off of it, or we had a hard upward run followed by a correction and then a slow retracement back upwards.

This is my favorite one of these hodl gifs I’ve ever seen. Thank you so much for this. I literally laughed out loud at “this is our opportunity..... for sick gains!!”

What fees did you pay if you don't mind me asking? I'm about to move mine as well and I'm curious. For example what could I expect to pay per bitcoin?

Does Coinbases cold storage, where I hold the key(s) count? I'm just trying to understand this as well

What kind of fees are we looking at right now? I'm about to move my coins out of coinbase tomorrow and I'm curious. What could I expect to pay to move 1 BTC, for example?
