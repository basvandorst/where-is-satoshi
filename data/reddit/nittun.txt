Well if you were looking at milions and your reddit account might have given people a vague idea of who you really were, then making a new one seems like a pretty good idea. People get killed for a lot less than milions arround the world.

so many fallacies in the title and describtion, its hard to even comprehend. 
Money dont come from thin air. when you print 60B Euro the remaining euro loses the equivalant value. thats not even a new concept thats how it worked for 100s of years. talking about bitcoin in such a pretentious way considering that bitcoin in reality have no value.

except it is really not, even if bitcoins are what they claim to be (currency) it doesn't really interfer with JP morgans value in any way. There are hundreds of currencies on the market and it doesn't really change anything for them since most values are relatively unvolatile, it doesn't matter much if it's an american or a canadian dollar the value is 1:1 in the end. It doesn't take a genius to see that bitcoin is not what i claims to be. As long as that is the case it is unwise to think of it as a currency, as it is, bitcoins are worth both 1 and 0 of it self. there is no safety in it, it is extremely volatile, in that sense it is as these banks say it is. Im sure all banks have a plan to pivot if it turns into the real deal, but right now it's far from it.
