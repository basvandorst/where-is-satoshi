Cryptocurrency exchange Youbit has reportedly re-emerged after a series of hacks and a bankruptcy filing, amid an insurance claim controversy and civil lawsuits. I'm also shocked about this!

A lot of time will pass before the society seriously looks at bitcoin. Yes, there are progressive countries that seek to make money easier, but there are backward countries that can not be persuaded even by a dispute. There is still a generation that still does not understand what a smartphone is (!!!), there are still people who can see the phone and the Internet in principle ... Of course I also believe in the Future, in which the chicken is heated in the microwave as in the movie " fifth Element"....) But...)

Actually, many people were tempted to buy inexpensive bitcoins in the past, and then they sold or changed for nothing or, worse, lost. So you can only sympathize...
