trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. *The cost of mediation increases transaction costs*, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and **cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-
reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. **Merchants must
be wary of their customers**, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party
You're so right! I can totally see where he was talking about big important transactions as part of a settlement layer and didn't support or intend it to be used by merchants, commerce, or small casual transactions!  It says it right there in the introduction!

So, it *is* possible using grover's algorithm in O(1) qubits to solve it in O(2^n/2).   
@_date: 2016-08-17 02:15:16
I was disagreeing with [this commenter's analysis]( that you need all the gates pre-manufactured for grover's algorithm, making the number of gates scale exponentially with the input size.  That's not the case.  Universal quantum computers like [this one]( *do* have loops in them, and re-use the previous gates. They are based on a [quantum register]( model of a computer which builds the circuit linearly in time using normal computers and quantum registers made up of re-usable qubits.  
Source: I've designed quantum-register-model simulators for my graduate studies.
That commentator's math on the number of qubits required per iteration is also VERY wrong.  All the operations relating to the sha iterations are reversible and require no ancilarry bits.  8 dwords of sha state and 8 dwords of temporary for the iterations make a total of 16 dwords of space.  The message itself for bitcoin mining is constant, and doesn't need to be stored in quantum bits (only the nonce does).  32 bits of nonce is the only thing that needs to be varied for mining...meaning that a quantum implementation of sha256 hashing for mining only needs 17 dwords=544 bits.

Step 1, Buy a raspberry PI, an SD card, and a USB flash drive.
Step 2, download an offline copy of bitaddress.org (or use my python hd paper wallet software at 
Step 3, download it to the USB.
Step 4, boot the raspberry pi
Step 5, copy the wallet software to the USB
Step 6, run the wallet software to generate the key.  Use dice if you can.
Step 7, write down the address
Step 8, shutdown the RPi, burn the SD card and the USB drive.

You can always 'clean up' your garbage bits even if you have them (it's always possible to do this and it's necessary for the universality of quantum turing machines) and leave them not part of the oracle and leaving it perfectly reversible .  
The circuit size being long doesn't *really* matter because real-world universal quantum computers treat the length of the circuit as the *time* dimension, and the number of wires as the 'memory' dimension, just like a long classical program doesn't require you to build more wires into your CPU (replacing the length of the wires with CPU clocks), a long quantum 
program on a QTM doesn't reqire you to actually build a long circuit, you just run it as 'clocks' on the QTM
All the same, I actually *did* implement a toy sha2 (smaller widths) with no ancillary bits at all on my quantum simulator (because all the sha2 operations are reversible).  I don't know if the code is on my github or not, I'll try to find it and post it if its not.
You're right that the business model is dumb though and without quantum hardware this is extra dumb shit.

That's not even supposed to be possible because there is a checksum on the wallet address that prevents you from simply mistyping it.
It's entirely possible that *no-one* owns that wallet, as in, there's nobody alive who knows the private key corresponding to that address.  In this case, you have no chance of getting it back.
@_date: 2016-08-17 14:58:51
Here's that code I was saying.   You don't need any ancillary bits and you can uncompute the result of the garbage that gets stored in F to reset the temporary state back to |0&gt; for A-F.  It's for SHA1 not SHA2, so it might be different, but I don't think it's too different.

All electronic voting systems (even blockchain ones) have the fundamental flaw that a system that is auditable against election fraud is always by definition open to vote-selling and vote-coercing.   
You must always choose which outcome is more valuable: an election that cannot be sold or coerced or audited or an election that can.

Basically yes.   
To clarify: Your wallet is entirely derivable from your 12-word backup key and all the same addresses will be used.  The format of the 12-word key is becoming something of a standard and can be used in a large number of wallet softwares simultaneously

I don't think that btc is bch (the amhardfork and sighash forkid changed that)  but in a philosophical sense, the coin that currently is traded as btc isn't bitcoin either.  Bitcoin used to be (and was advertised as) a way to reliably, privately, universally, and cheaply recieve transactions from anyone without relying on a third party.  The current BTC coin has none of those properties.
It's not reliable (confirmation times are incredibly variable and can result in transactions being dropped from the mempool even assuming you reject rbf transactions).  It's not private (the high costs to create signatures have incentivised both address reuse and made mixers economically unviable).  It's not universal (the blocksize war has made bitcoin dominance drop below 50%, and merchant adoption is not just stagnating, it's decreasing.  People are no longer able to create wallets for their friends and family and don't encourage its use because small amounts are unspendable and medium amounts rot when transferred).  
It's not cheap, transactions with fees less than the daily income of some nations never get confirmed.  Ever.
The only way to use it at all now is off-chain, such as inside coinbase.  I used to *never* make offchain bitcoin transactions and in recent months I've avoided using bitcoin at all because of the $20 fees and when I *had* to use it I used coinbase's insecure wallet more than a few times because it would allow an off-chain centralized transaction.
 Even LN relies on a network of chained 3rd party hubs who are always online.
BCH isn't bitcoin because its an altcoin, but BTC isn't bitcoin because its unrecognizable to oldtimers

If I have a 3 input 2 output transaction (very common in practice) and I need to buy something in person, I need to confirm in less than 30 minutes because I can't sit with a stranger for 6 hours.   
To achieve that, id have to pay $25.52 right now.
Not all transactions for all use cases are $20, but for some use cases (like actually buying things) it is not possible to escape a $20 transaction.


The only way to currently get a $3 fee is to have less than 3 inputs and wait over 2 days to confirm.  Which might work if you control all your transactions and are sending from yourself to yourself, but it doesnt apply to any case where either other entities send you money or you are sending to other entities


The difference is that you don't need to trust the bitcoin node in order to have security that your coins will not be lost.  For a LN node if you are offline and not connected to a node you trust the game theory means you can be scammed.

Batching transactions doesn't decrease the miner fee.  The miner fee increases linearly with the number of outputs (it's paid as a size of the transaction in bytes). 
If a 2 output transaction costs $20 on chain, a 20 output transaction will cost $200.    
It's not quite 1:1, batching does provide you a small savings, but it is a linear increase not a constant increase.

To be fair while this is at least partially true, people don't generally have 100% optional spending.  People need to buy food, gas, shelter.  Since they'll be rich deflationarily, they'll probably want to buy some luxuries.

This is inefficient...you should not use parent-to-child this way.
You should instead simply use elliptic curve point addition.
ECC says that p(a+b)=p(a)+p(b) (where p(x) calculates the public key from the private key of x).    
If your order id is a 256 bit hash h, then that means that you can use it as a bitcoin private key.  if h is the private key, then p(h) is the public key.
On the secure computer, you generate a root private key a.  Then you generate the root public key p(a).   You transfer the root public key p(a) over to the insecure computer.
Then, the private key for a specific orderid h is a+h, which you only compute on the secure server.    The public key (and therefore the address) for a specific order id is p(a)+p(h) which you compute on the insecure server by using the stored value for p(a).
I have tested python code that does this 
	import bitcoin 
	import hashlib
	def get_order_addr(root_pubkey,orderid):
		hash_pubkey=bitcoin.privtopub(hashlib.sha256(orderid).hexdigest())
		order_pubkey=bitcoin.add_pubkeys(root_pubkey,hash_pubkey)
		return bitcoin.pubtoaddr(order_pubkey)
	
	 ONLY
	def get_order_privkey(root_privkey,orderid):
		hash_privkey=hashlib.sha256(orderid).hexdigest()
		return bitcoin.add_privkeys(root_privkey,hash_privkey)
	def get_root_pubkey(root_privkey):
		return bitcoin.privtopub(root_privkey)
	if __name__=="__main__":
		orderid="hello1"  can be any data, including a sha512 hash.
		root_privkey="F239F239F239F239F239F239F239F239F239F239F239F239F239F239F239F239"  DON"T USE THIS
		root_pubkey=get_root_pubkey(root_privkey)   is just a standard pub/priv pair you don't have to use this tool to generate it you can use any system.
	
		order_privkey=get_order_privkey(root_privkey,orderid)
		order_addr_priv=bitcoin.privtoaddr(order_privkey)		 generate priv/addr pair for test orderid
	
		order_addr_pub=get_order_addr(root_pubkey,orderid)		 generate addr for test orderid
	
		print(order_addr_priv)

What something is worth is decided by the market and by faith.  There's no such thing as an objective "price index" currency.   There can't be by definition.   The value of things is only measured in terms of what people are willing to trade for them.
All centralized currencies are basically what you are describing indirectly anyway, except with different commodities.
For example, suppose that I actually wanted to do this.  Suppose I issued "Steve Coins" that were backed (by me).  I promise, in return, that one steve coin is ALWAYS redeemable for 
    1 gallon of gasoline
    4 loaves of bread
    3 apples
    25 12-gauge shotgun shells
    1 stick of butter.
Because these are the things that I assume people need.   I also am willing to issue SteveCoins in trade for these numbers of (unspoiled) goods.
Now, by definition, either I keep up with this obligation consistently, or I do not.  If I do 100% and people believe me 100%, then because of arbitrage SteveCoins will consistently maintain the value of these items to the market....but that doesn't guarantee anything about the dollar conversion rate of those items.  For example, the price of apples or gasoline in USD dollars can swing wildly up and down as people value those items less or more as a portion of their paycheck and as paychecks go up or down on average.  This means that the visible "price" of stevecoins (on the black market USD&lt;-&gt;SteveCoin exchanges will also fluctuate *even though my SteveCoins are backed by a commodity*)  
If I do NOT keep up with this obligation, then the price that it converges on will be the same as the above multiplied times the percentage that represents the faith that people have in me.  Their fluctuating faith also represents price changes.
The thing that you will notice is that the exact same thing will happen if I pick any other 'backing' commodity: like gold, or sugar, or silver, or even bitcoins.  Literally any currency 'backing' will *always* have voilatility equal to the amount that people desire the backed goods, and the amount that people can use the backed goods, times the faith that the market has that the backing will be worth something in the future to other actors.
In fact, that's basically all the USD *is*:  There's a market-based perception of how much all the items in the entire market cost in USD, that represents the 'value' of the commodity basket that 'backs' the USD.   To put it another way, the USD is a commodity basket currency already, where the commodity basket in question is literally every good or service available on the market, multiplied times the faith that the US government won't collapse.
Tl:Dr; there's no such thing as a price index that means anything.

There are dozens of ways to do this the right one is up to you.  Coinbase and Bitpay are very popular, but they honestly sound FAR too complex for your use case.  It sounds like your clients are individually invoiced after talking to you.  You don't need to do much, just attach a valid bitcoin address from your companies wallet to the invoice.


Theres no "official" bitcoin merchant status.  There's no "official" bitcoin company.  Theres nothing you have to do to accept bitcoin.


 Is this even a good idea (to give a discount)? Any tips from anyone that has done this before?
I don't know if it's a good idea as I've never run a retail business, but people do it all the time.

All of the following are TRUE stories of the past year for me.
The other day I was at a yard sale.  I saw an interesting item that I wanted to buy.  I had my cell phone, but I don't carry cash.  Oh well.  Too bad the yard saler could not accept mastercard and didn't have a Verisign terminal.  If only there was a way that people could do cheap peer-to-peer transfers without using cash.
The other day I heard of a cool charity I would like to donate to.   However, they required a complex landing page that required me to submit an incredible amount of personal information along with my credit card on an insecure form.  It took nearly 20 minutes to fill out, but it turns out I didn't have my card.  It's probably just as well, because they probably would have stolen my identity anyway.  It's funny, because their billboard had "&lt;Name&gt; &lt;Phone Number&gt; DONATE NOW"....I wish it was as easy as copying a number off a billboard to send them money anonymously and safely.
My friend told me he and the guests would pay me back if I ordered pizzas for his party.  Unfortunately only 1 in 3 guests had cash.  I ended up paying for pizza, and they all told me they would get me back later when they had cash....but of course none of them did.  Too bad there's no way for a group of people to electronically pool money to a person if they don't happen to carry cash on them.
My friend in seoul, south korea found herself in a little bit of trouble.  It's complicated, but she needed an emergency $200 to take her pet to the vet.  I already owed her the money, so she called me on skype to ask me if I could make good on her debt....I told her sure....as soon as banks open in the morning (8+ hour time delay) and I could get an international wire transfer...she'd have the money in 1-2 weeks.  I wish there was a simple way to instantly transfer funds internationally 24/7, maybe to something like a phone or email address or ATM.
tl:dr; You're delusional if you think bitcoin is useless.

I don't see how there are an infinite number of addresses without patching the protocol to change it.  
Currently, there are only, at most, 2^160 valid bitcoin addresses.  2^160 is a finite number.  It is very large but it's absolutely finite.
You say the number of addresses can be increased by patching the protocol I guess in a backwards incompatible way, but that's like saying there are an infinite number of pronouns because we could, at some point in the future, rewrite the definition of the english language to include more.  That's not how it works.  There *currently* are a finite number of pronouns because we've only defined so many.  There are *currently* a finite number of addresses because that's how we've defined what an address is: an address is a 160-bit integer.
That's a similar claim, honestly, to the idea that there are infinite coins...you say 'the decimal places can be increased'.  Not really, it can't.  Again, without re-designing the protocol, the maximum number of decimal points that you can move in order to subdivide a bitcoin is exactly 8.  
There are a finite number of satoshis in the world unless we re-write all the rules at some unknown part in the future.




Ok, but, I mean, what is an infinite amount of math?  What does that even mean?
@_date: 2015-06-17 05:08:56
The point is that you can make an address which, if you use it to receive coins, will ALWAYS be passively denominated in dollars

Thats not how it works.  They use something called split-key mining...basically you can combine two known public keys in such a way as to get a new public key...that new public key has a private key which can only be gotten by combining two private keys in the same way.
Basically, you generate a secret key, generate the public key, give them the public key, they do the same thing, and use split-key combination during the mining.    Then, when they find the address, they send you the secret key and you do the secret key recombination yourself.

You have the service they are offering wrong.  It's not a trading platform (although you can use it for that if you like).  It's a bitcoin wallet that works just like any other wallet, and is compatible with the blockchain, except certain addresses (real bitcoin addresses) you designate are automatically fiat-denominated.  
The advantage of this clear: for example, suppose you are a charity.  Rather than setting up a merchant account with coinbase and creating a button that expires that your users have to click on along with configuring their 'instant convert button' and treating every transaction as a 'sale' with specific amounts, you can go much much less complicated: You can simply post your bitcoin address on your website. 
 Now, users just send what they want to that address.  Of course, you want it to be in dollars not bitcoin because you don't want to deal with price volatility, but you also don't want to have to remember to go on bitstamp and initiate a trade every single goddamn time somebody deposits something to your address.   With bitreserve, you generate the address in their wallet and post it to your site.  To all your clients you are just a standard bitcoin address.  But on the backend, that address is dollar-denominated, so you don't ever have to think about the voliatility of the transfers you recieve.
As an alternative, think about if you and your buddy owe each-other money for pizza.  He wants to pay you back in bitcoin.  You like how easy bitcoin is to use (you just give him your address and he can send it to you in two seconds) but you don't like holding bitcoins because you don't want to lose your money.  You can have a bitreserve wallet, give him your dollar-denominated address when he asks for it, and boom the pizza money is automatically recieved by you in dollars.
It's the convenience of bitcoin payments and a bitcoin wallet, with the value of dollars.
*EDIT HERE*:  As an example expounding on the pizza example, if HIS wallet is also a dollar-denominated on bitreserve, then there's actually no fees and the transfer is instant.  Neither of you even has to be aware of this fact.  Both of you see it as a bitcoin transaction, sending to a bitcoin address somewhere, but since behind the scenes no conversion is necessary, none takes place.

That's not quite what I said, but I see your point. I said (or meant to say) it can only create transactions from the address that it is hosting on when it is triggered by an input. Subtle difference. However, in response to this, I believe an implementation flag could be put on the compiler for the language to add your restriction without changing the language in any significant way. I did not add this patch yet, however.
I personally do not believe it would matter, however. Again, it falls back to what we talked about before where the only response the script can activate is a send...that said, I'd like to see what kind of attack you are talking about, because I believe that in most cases it won't matter. For example


In this case, the script is triggered, but as far as I understand it, when the 0-conf transactions that are included in the script's outputs and then revised later, the the script's outputs which included those outputs would ALSO fail to confirm, effectively 'rewinding' the script as if it didn't execute. This is what I was referring to when I was saying it's important to only have the possible side-effects be outputs.
I'm also willing to admit ignorance of the finer details of the protocol that you may have studied more. If so please correct me.


Firstly, balance&lt;address&gt; looks up the balance of the argument, not the balance of the host address. To get the balance of the host address, we use $balance.
However, I just patched this issue. You are right that you may want to only check the confirmed 'remote balance' so I added a second optional argument to balance that is a single integer recommending the number of confirmations necessary for the returned remote balance.
I'm also adding a flag for the runtime for the number of confirms to use when computing the host balance with $balance.

Coinapult is their closest competitor.  The difference is that coinapult requires explicitly inititating a trade.  Locking can't keep the address locked, if you ger more funds they are in bitcoin still but have to be re-locked.
It's kind of like bitreserve is coinapult locks but automatic re-locking.

Yep you got it.

Suppose you want to send me $10 in bitcoin to pay me back for pizza, today.
I have a wallet on blockchain.info, so I send you the wallet address (or you look up my address from your contacts book for me) and you initiate a send for 0.027 BTC to my address.
Now, because that address is hosted on blockchain.info (or a paper wallet, or an android wallet, or whatever), the value is stored in BTC.  It will be there as 0.027 bitcoin today, tomorrow, forever.  
However, that $10 you paid me for pizza might now be $8 worth a day later, before I've had time (I'm a busy guy) to log into my blockchain account, log into my bitfinex account, transfer from my blockchain account to my bitfinex account, wait for 3 confirmations, then initiate a market buy.   THAT PROCESS IS A HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS AND MUST BE DONE MANUALLY EVERY TIME BITCOIN HITS MY ADDRESS THAT I GIVE MY FRIENDS.  If I want to not lose money I recieve in my wallet to voilatility, I have to explicitly do that whole process (which takes a couple hours, I've done it) EVERY SINGLE TIME someone just throws me a couple of coints.
Now imagine a website with a donation address on their frontpage like the FSF does.  They face the same problem, but now they have to do it every single day or every single time they get a transaction.
Bitreserve automates this process.  By giving you a static address that you can give out to your friends or family or post online or associate with a comment or whatever, you can have all the convenience of just texting someone your addres when they want to give you pizza.  
However, bitreserve automatically keeps all money you recieve totally safe in dollars, without you having to do ANYTHING.  You can passively recieve funds to an address, and bam, dollars.

Right now the only trigger is on a recieve transaction event.   The current daemon doesn't trigger coinrelay scripts on a schedule like that.  However, you could either 1) modify the daemon to trigger on a schedule with a cron job 2) set up a cron job to trigger a dust payment to coinrelay on the schedule you want 3) Not worry about the schedule but do it every time a transaction is received like coinrelay is designed for.
Regardless of what triggers it, here is the script you want
    
	 your 'target' address is 1tgt88h2G81yoccfUt9QjQVgqCaXY5C3y
	balance&lt;1tgt88h2G81yoccfUt9QjQVgqCaXY5C3y&gt;	  the balance of 1tgt88h2G81yoccfUt9QjQVgqCaXY5C3y on the stack 
	nano&lt;0.1&gt;					 
	greater if					  its more than 0.1 BTC
		$balance 10 div minus_fee		  %10 of this balance (minus the fee)
		send&lt;1tgt88h2G81yoccfUt9QjQVgqCaXY5C3y&gt;	  it to the target
		$default_fee pushtx
	endif

The main difference is the user experience.  Locks require you to actively choose to lock and unlock a specific amount at a specific time.  Bitreserve dollar-denominated addresses require no user intervention to passively protect the value of the money no matter what is added or spent.
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:25:48
I understood that.  I want to make it clear that balance&lt;addr&gt; and $balance are not the same.  One of them is the remote balance instruction that looks up another address, and one of them is the host balance.
Balance&lt;addr&gt; is now balance&lt;addr,confs&gt;...does that fix your concerns for remote balances?  I agree with you thats necessary.
For the local host $balance, I don't see how that could cause a problem.  The worst case scenario is that (like in the case for the script above) it incorporates 0 conf inputs in the relay output, in which case any failed confirmations in the relay input cascade through the relay output, 'undoing' the transaction.
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:56:04
That is correct, but I'd like to point out thats only this hacked-together reference 'standalone' client in crcc.py.
The coinrelay language and compiler (coinrelay.py) does not depend on the blockchain.info API.  An alternate client daemon frontend could easily be written that interfaces with bitcoin-qt's -walletnotify event.
In fact that's something I'm working on!

Why is it bullshit for idiots?
@_date: 2014-11-26 21:04:48
What it does is that it's PASSIVE
That's the big difference.  To do what it does when someone sends you bitcoin manually you'd have to manually generate a deposit address at your exchange, wait for it to go through (or have a script do it) and then wait until its confirmed, then log into your exchange (probably on your phone or with 2FA) then initiate a sell order.
This of course, is a giant pain in the ass.
What I REALLY want is to be able to say "donate now" on my website by just posting my bitcoin address, and when ANY money hits that address it automatically converts it to fiat.  Now I can PASSIVELY recieve bitcoin by posting an address, but keep that bitcoin in dollars.  I don't have to think about it when someone pays me.
If you want to SPEND bitcoin, then you'd normally have to go to the exchange, trade manually from dollars-&gt;bitcoins, then initiate a send to the spend address.  But with bitreserve, that process is automatic.
"Yo man, how much do I owe you for getting the pizza?"
"Oh, it's $10 man"
"Sweet, uh I don't have cash can I give you coins?"
"Yeah, no problem, here's my dollar address: 1Swd2&lt;blah&gt;"
"Cool thanks"
Then he sends to that address, and YOU DON"T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING to make sure that $10 dollars doesn't become $5 later.
It allows you to have the convenience and passivity of a standard wallet that can transparently receive coins without user interaction, except it can hold value in fiat currencies behind the addresses.
Coinapult requires user interaction to activate a lock at a certain price after a reciept.
Exchanges require user interaction to sell the coins.
Bitreserve is the only PASSIVE conversion.
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:06:53
The answer to question 1) depends on the answer to question 2), so I'll answer 2) first


The only possible state-changing side-effects possible with this language are to send or relay coin to other addresses.  This restriction is important for security.
If someone attempts a double-spend attack on the address hosting the relay, then at 0 confirms some computation would be performed, then the coin would be relayed (and possibly split)
to other addresses using the inputs as outputs.  In that sense, it actually doesn't matter if the relay has confirmations, only whatever I do with the outputs at my final destination.
Lets say I want to split...I want to send half to coinbase to be converted to USD
and I want the other half to go to my wallet and when it hits 6conf I'm gonna ship a package or something.
Suppose someone does a 0-conf double-spend attack on the relay, address then the two outputs the relay generates
will not confirm either, and the double-spend attack 'propogates' through the relay.  The transactions at both 'ends' of the output would fail to confirm and I wouldn't 
ship the package and coinbase wouldn't convert my money.  It's not a problem as long as the 'outputs' of the script have the protection I need.  As always, in bitcoin, before
shipping physical goods make sure you have confirms, even if that went through a CoinRelay.
I could probably add a feature to check confirmations, but I don't know if I want to yet.


Three reasons, in order
First, its a lot cleaner and simpler.  I tried making a python library and I ended up worrying about a lot of un-necessary details, like types, quoting, whitespace, control flow, overflows and underflows,
etc.  When I switched to this approach all the code for my use cases looked nice and clean
Second, Sandboxing:  I wanted it to theoretically be possible to set up nodes for other people using scripts that they wrote.  Basically, charge a fee to host a server that listens to the bitcoin network and runs scripts.  Or to allow customers to control their bank accounts.   It's very difficult to correctly sandbox a turing-complete language so that CPU time isn't excessively used.
Thirdly:  The 0-conf answer I gave above only applies because the language itself prohibits any side-effect inducing behavior other than simply cascading the transactions.  What that means is that if it was 
a python library, then you could do literally ANYTHING in response to a transaction, including ship a package, tweet something, release some kind of encryption for DRM, or email stuff.  All or most of those things would be 
side-effect actions that you would NOT want to do without confirms, dramatically changing the security model.

Yes, if you sent it to a Dollar-denominated address


Yes, if you store that in a dollar-denominated address.  


Any bitcoins that get sent to/from a dollar denominated address are automatically converted.


If you send it to a bitcoin-denominated address then yes, it's stored in bitcoin and you are susceptible to fluctuations.  You can send it to a bitcoin-denominated address or a peso-denominated address if youwant and you'll have to face the volatility of the peso or bitcoin.

You can import the xpub output by this tool with any bip32/44 compatible device to make a watch-only account.  
However, I personally do not know how you could sufficiently secure or airgap a mobile device for cold storage when generating your private keys or xpubs.  That seems wildly insecure.   It seems impossible to verify that there is no malware or that the device is truely offline or isn't archiving the keys for the next moment when it is offline.
Generate the private keys and the xpub using this tool on a raspberry pi or linux live CD on a desktop with no internet, write down your 12 words, then copy the xpub back with the same usb drive you used to install this tool (it works out of the box on any python distribution 2.7 with no additional dependencies)
The xpub generated can be used with any gui-based tool like mycelium.  It can be imported easily by visiting blockchain.info/xpub/&lt;xpubtext&gt; which makes a QR code and shows the transactions.  Import it into mycelium as a watch-only account and it will work perfectly with a gui for cold storage.
Your 12 words will work forever on any compatible wallet.  When you want to spend from cold storage you can use them in the phone directly, or you can boot a new live CD install and run this tool to sign the transactions again if you want to be actually airgapped.

I am not a lawyer, and they are, but I thought that as of the copyright act of 1976 what granted you copyrights was NOT registration but was simply the creation of a work, as in, a you can still sue someone for copyright infrinigement even if a work is never registered.
Registration merely helps your case, as it provides substantive proof that you were the first to create the work in question that is undeniable to the court.   This is why people do "poor man's copyright" sometimes of emailing something to themselves....because your work is copyright automatically without registration, you still have all the necessary rights as long as you can prove the work is yours and you created it first.
A blockchain copyright registration (e.g., putting the hash of the work signed by you into the blockchain) would still have legal weight to that end even today, right now, without amending any law.

A wallet monitors the network for incoming transactions, and also signs and creates outgoing transactions, and announces it to the user, like email.
Opt-in RBF says that, if the sender of a transaction adds a flag to the transaction, they can do a chargeback before it confirms.  Transactions with unconfirmed inputs are transactions where the transactions necessary to spend them haven't confirmed yet, meaning the transaction A might be a valid non-reversable transaction, but transaction B and C (which are the sources of A) might not confirm yet or might be designed to have fees low enough to be reversable, indicating a possible chargeback attempt.
In the same way that your email client or email inbox can flag things to likely be spam, It's possible for a wallet recieiving incoming transactions to check the transactions for these conditions and warn the reciever "Hey, this transaction that just came in looks fishy".  The reciever then does not give any goods or services to the sender until it confirms.
@_date: 2016-03-01 00:28:04
Just use mycelium.  Current version of mycelium checks both unconfirmed inputs, and RBF transactions and gives you a warning.  In that case, decide for yourself.

What payment flow do you want?
As in, how do you want your customers to be able to get their bitcoin?  
From a technical perspective, this is pretty easy to set up.
It depends a lot on the kind of user experience you want and how familiar with bitcoin your users are.
I'd do this:   
* Generate a random 'redeem code' called R for every voucher.  It's a 256-bit base58-encoded number.  It being ACTUALLY random is important, use a cryptographically secure source of random numbers

Knowing your customer requires actually knowing that the person who you are dealing with is the person that they are claiming to be.   This requires being able to demonstrate that you had reasonable cause to believe that the person who owned the account matched the documentation they sent you.   The regulations for this are even stricter for money transmitters.   This is why Paypal, for example, requires such strict laws for linking your bank account and your home address, because to get a bank account you have to go in person and present ID which matches your home address.
I guarantee you that whatever money transmitter you are working with that does not have  this requirement has some other method of verification, such as linking directly to a bank with a verified account, or some kind of face-to-face interaction or encounter.

You mean with a single private key?  Not with the current version of this tool.  I might add that functionality later, but no.


The usage example makes two send addresses in the transaction.  The tool automatically generates change addresses for your bip32/44 wallet appropriately and puts that in the transaction along with all the sends.  
That version of the tool does not allow you to specify the change address manually, although I might add that feature.

@_date: 2017-03-17 23:32:54


This is not at all the case.  Addresses are generated according to a format, and that format is the same on both chains and with both clients.  Altcoins only change the version bits in their addresses out of convenience, but for a fork on the bitcoin chain, the address format will have to remain the same in order for there to be backwards compatibility.
An address is just a number.

Your play by play is right, but it depends on there being no usable or sellable BTU for the entire duration of the difficulty adjustment, which could be up to 56 days or even 100 days (if BTU activates at 75%).
Furthermore, BTC will be even *harder* to use during that time because confirmation times will be up to 40 minutes...
If there is a market for BTU and a demand for selling BTU then why would exchanges not appear, almost instantly, making it possible to use?  They already claim they are going to create a market for it.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:43:56


If there is a hardfork at say 75% and the BU chain is no longer recognized, the BC chain will instantly drop to 25% of its previous hashpower.  For the next 2016 blocks, miners on the BC chain will make 1/4th as much BC per day as they used to, and blocks will confirm 4x slower. 
A 4x decrease in BTC income from block rewards (especially considering the uncertainty of the split would be really harsh on the USD price too during that time) could be a powerful incentive to send at least some miners to the other chain, (which would have only experienced a 25% drop in income, so would be 3x more profitable to mine on).  This of course would continue to exacerbate the problem for the miners who stay as difficulty drops even faster than the adjustment.  
With just the initial 75% drop, this problem for BTC miners will last for at *least* (40min/block * 2016 blocks) **56 days**.  If only 10% more miners break ranks to get 3x as many coins during this (rough) period, the period will extend to 96 days and the BU block reward/BTC block reward (in coins) go up to 5.6:1...
A 4x increase in confirmation time (even though it's only temporary) could also potentially drive users to the other chain, especially because the other chain will have larger blocks (because that's what caused the fork).  
It's possible to believe that the economic value of BTC is greater than BTU long term because of decentralization, but even assuming that is true, it's completely possible the BTC chain will effectively die in the short term.

It's fine to make it the default as a political statement about what *should* be, but making it mandatory makes breadwallet totally unusable for people who don't like doing arithmetic in their head to buy coffee or plane tickets or drinks, and it makes it impossible for me to recommend breadwallet when I introduce people to bitcoin.

So, is `sha256(concatenatedbip39seed)` vulnerable or not?  If so, how would you possibly get it?   If not, then the statement "All brainwallets are vulnerable" is false.
Most people use easy-to-guess google passwords like 'pass152', so does that mean that "All gmail accounts are vulnerable" and "anyone promoting gmail is grossly irresponsible if not outright malicious"?  
Of course not.  gmail has reasonable security standards and is a valuable product that can be used correctly if the correct amount of entropy is used for a password.  If you get your gmail account hacked because your favorite bible verse is your password, that doesn't reflect poorly on gmail in the least.
Brainwallets are not susceptible to physical theft like a paper wallet or phone or the core client.  They are not susceptible to power loss or hard drive failure the way the core client is or electrum is.  They are not susceptible to password cracking or malware the way all clients are.  They are not susceptible to RNG attacks or PSRNG attacks.  They are not susceptible to timing attacks or buffer overflows or EM side channels the way a hardware wallet might be.  
A brainwallet with good entropy is more secure than a trezor, as the only way to get it is to torture you.  The only way to lose it is a head injury.
There are good reasons to use them, especially if you know how entropy works, and for people who do, they are the best option. Even if most people without guidance make bad passwords, most people without guidance make bad passwords for *all* services.   
@_date: 2017-01-16 20:09:20


This is not the case.  My brainwallet is a memorized 12-word BIP039/44 HD wallet.  It has only been transacted out of cold storage.
It's not vulnerable at all.  Not all brain wallets are vulnerable.  Bad passwords and weak passwords are vulnerable.

Which I agree, but I never advocated for sha256 brainwallets.  I originally included *all* of these kinds of schemes as 'brainwallet', including a memorize-only hd wallet seed.   
Even so, the statement "are sha256 wallets are vulnerable" is patently untrue.


My point is that you keep giving examples where people used bad passwords and guess what, got screwed.  if someone uses a security product incorrectly, then that is bad,  yes, but it's *fundamentally* different from that security product being intrinsically useless or flawed.


If someone steals my phone or computer, they won't get my bitcoins but then neither will I.  Unless I keep it backed up in a safe place like a safe, but safes are targets for theft as well, and then we're back to the password and therefore the entropy, being the only protection, which takes us back to the first issue.  
A brainwallet has legitimate uses for some people and has the lowest threat surface for some people.  I share a home and a safe with people who 1) know that I have bitcoin 2) know how to crack password hashes 3) know how to look for bitcoin wallets.    For me, a brainwallet means that I am completely secure from those people as long as I have a sufficiently high-entropy password (which is true for most other security systems)


Who said I was generating it with a human brain?  You can (and should) use dice.  Dice are immune to RNG attacks and malware, unlike [other wallets](


It does have passphrase support.  However, if I lose it or someone swipes it or I leave it at home and am forced to run away from my home or it falls into boiling oil or boiling water or there is a fire, I'm fucked unless I wrote down my 12-word seed somewhere else.  
If I wrote down my 12-word seed somewhere else then the security of my system is at least as bad as the security of a paper wallet.  If I memorized my 12-word seed the security of my system is at least as bad as the security of my brainwallet.
In addition, a trezor is not airgapped and potentially susceptible to electromagnetic or timing-based side channel attacks, or exploitable flaws in the USB client protocol, or man-in-the-middle attacks.  Of course they try to mitigate these things but they are potentially *possible* because it's electronic.    A series of words in my mind can't be EM-exploited.


You didn't say "Most brainwallets are vulnerable because people choose low-entropy passwords".  If you had, I would have agreed instantly.  Just like email accounts, or facebook accounts, or cell-phone unlock screens, or SSH keys, or bitcoin wallet PRNG implementations, or credit cards, or basically other consumer-facing-security system, most people adopt practices for brainwallets and passwords that allow them to be hacked.  
However, you said "ALL brainwallets are vulnerable and it's irresponsible to ever use them ever".   If your defense for this claim is that "ALL brainwallets are vulnerable because some people got hacked because they had bad passwords" then the same logic would support a claim that "ALL email accounts are vulnerable and email should not be used." or "ALL SSL certificates are vulnerable and SSL should not be used." or "ALL android wallets are vulnerable and android wallets should not be used". etc etc.
If you want to judge a security system based on whether or not the average person has a crackable password on the system that was exploited, then fine, but at least do it consistently. 
If it's not possible to hack "ALL" brainwallets (it isn't) then you shouldn't claim "All brainwallets are vulnerable" unless you think all ssh keys are vulnerable or all email is vulnerable.




Again, "People with low-entropy passwords got hacked" is not the same as "ALL".  
Seriously, I have a lot of bitcoin in a sha256 brainwallet right now.  Over 30.  Come get it.  Not even kidding.  If you can take it you can have it, and I will have learned an expensive lesson.  If you can't, please admit that the claim "All brainwallets are vulnerable" is a lie.

I really hope that either you are wrong or this is not the system that is being standardized.

@_date: 2017-01-04 18:06:04
Still not hard to memorize, but you can also switch to a 12-word seed.  (Standard)
12 words is 128 bits of entropy.  24 words is 256 bits of entropy, which is overkill because bitcoin addresses are only 160 bits of entropy and secp2k1 only has 128 bits of entropy....meaning that an attacker who could recover your 12 words with brute force could also directly brute force your private key from your public key.
So 24 words provides no additional entropic security over 12 words, but if it makes it harder to memorize then you lose security because you have to store the key.12 words is better

Not all brain wallets ARE vulnerable.  I'll repeat that again.  It is a direct lie to claim "All brainwallets are vulnerable"
What *is* vulnerable are low-entropy bad passwords that most people use to make a brainwallet.
Even if you specifically are referring to the 'standard' brainwallet which is a double-sha of a password, (which is not what mine is, admittedly) then even STILL, a brainwallet is only vulnerable if you use a low-entropy password, otherwise it's more secure than a trezor if used correctly.
If I converted `dbl_sha256('panicextrahenlockglimpsedealclothhammerawesome')` as a private key to an address, that would be a 'brainwallet' with 96 bits of entropy, and you would never get my bitcoin before mankind spread across the galaxy.

@_date: 2016-12-24 03:31:38
No, because using the LN requires locking the coins into a payment channel which requires an on chain transaction to be created and signed (but not broadcast).  Counterparty risk of the transaction being broadcast on chain is what makes the lightning transactions have economic value....so if the $5 transaction would cost $2 to broadcast then it's still going to cost that to get it into a payment channel I'm pretty sure

Yes, but there are some caveats: You have to 1) choose enough words from a wordlist with enough entries to give you safe entropy.  
2) You have to *actually* select randomly.  This means rolling a dice or generating a secure random number some other way (like sampling atmospheric noise).     If you pick 'words you like from the list out of your head' then the entropy will be MUCH lower.   
3)  Use like 8-12 words to give you 100 bits of entropy, not 2 words.

Almost all regulation is bad, and this regulation isn't *good*, but for what it's worth I don't really see how this changes anything.  As far as I can tell it does two things:  firstly, it says that people who cash or redeem or exchange virtual currencies are financial institutions and money transmitters and subject to those regulations (which is effectively the status quo).   Secondly, it instructs the DHS to come up with a plan to detect virtual currencies at the border (which will be either ineffective or unconstitional).

Because 'getting lucky' in the case of entropy on the order of 100 bits means that you'd have to get a random guess on a one out of 2^100 chance.    That's for a decent brainwallet. 
An actual properly generated wallet has entropy on the order 256 bits (for a private key)
For reference, the chance of a given person getting struck by lighting in a given year is 1 in 750000.   The chance that you are struck by lighting in a given second is 1 in 750000*(31536000 (number of seconds in a year) = 1 in 2.365 * 10^13.
Therefore, your chance of getting struck by lighting 5 times in 5 seconds is one in (2.365 * 10^13 )^5 or one in 7.39 * 10^66 , which is still 10000000000 times more likely than your chance of randomly guessing my wallet, which is 1 in 2^256 or 1 in 1.15 * 10^77

So, yeah.  If you accept dollars and then give bitcoin, to someone else, you're a money transmitter.  Money transmitters don't have an activity threshold.  Yes, this means if you sell $2 of bitcoin you are a money launderer.  It's insane and dumb but it's the law.

Again, why is this a problem?  As a sender by default I use multiple addresses in my wallet for transactions and have exactly the same level of security given by the reciever using multiple addresses, but it's a lot more convenient for me (and for the reciever).
I can also use a mixer if I want when sending to that address. 
I can also simply not care...because I know that my address isn't associated to my name I have no fundamental privacy risk that isn't the same as anywhere else with any other internet technology (such as a static reddit username or an email address).
If the sender can simultaneously take responsibility for their OWN privacy AND donate simply and easily (a text-based address is a LOT easier than a javascript page) then I don't see why not.
TL;DR A reddit where everyone used a throwaway for every post would be more 'private', but not as usable considering it would be impossible to actually contact a person.

Yes, it is safe for brainwallets.  A combination of 4 random words, actually random, from a wordlist of 2048 (such as [BIP 39]( Has 44 bits of entropy, meaning you would have to generate 2^44 brainwallets to watch them all (which is an incredibly large, but not intractable, amount if you had a cluster).    If you want a GOOD amount of entropy you can do even more words 11-12, which is what BIP 039 wallets (like mycelium) do.    
Yes, this is WAY WAY WAY more secure than a one-word troubadour password.

Is there a good reason for why, exactly?

Yeah I knew what you meant, and yes, if you have a shitty pRNG you can crack it with multiple addresses just the same way as you can crack it with multiple signatures.   It's a different kind of attack but it still involves using knowledge of the way the state stream is generated.


Are you using a different codebase for every transaction?  You change wallet apps for every transaction you make?  If so, that's hilariously absurd.  If not, then any flaw you have in your pRNG in your wallet software can be exploited regardless of whether or not you reuse addresses.


Ironically, I actually do. I have one using a hardware RNG, that I built from scratch (lcd panels and microcontrollers and some zener diodes for rng) , and a couple that I've written in python to be airgapped and a diceware brainwallet.
However, I agree with you that it's not really relevant because most people can't do that.


The point is that *you're right* you DON'T have any direct control over the code you're using.  There could be any number of vulnerablities in the pRNG of your software.  You just have to HOPE that there aren't (unless you go insane and do diceware, but that's not really reasonable).  
My point is that even though you can't control it, address reuse does literally nothing to hurt or harm the risk of flawed wallet software.   If your wallet is insecure, you're fucked regardless.


So we agree then that my original point that there's nothing wrong with them using a static receiving address to solicit donations for their project, considering it adds significant convenience?  Cool.

If your RNG is compromised you're basically fucked anyway.  If your RNG is compromised and an attacker knows it then they can do other attacks regardless of how many addresses you use.
Generate secure crypto in the first place and this isn't a problem.  
Besides, the question here isn't why to not use a static *sending* address, the question is why to not use a static *recieving* address for something like this, a charity.

I think that much much much less entropy is very reasonable for the casual user.
A 12 word bip39 mnemonic is 128 bits of entropy.  Assuming your attacker has a production quantum computer then it can be cracked in 2^64 iterations.  Then assuming they can do a billion iterations per second on that quantum computer, it will still take 254 years to crack your mnemonic.
Considering that quantum computers on that magnitude of performance and memory simply do not (and likely will not) exist, (and if you don't use a quantum computer then even with the entire hash power of the bitcoin network you will have to wait till the end of the universe to crack it), 128 bits is probably fine
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:33:51
Brainwallets are a great idea as long as you use a good wordlist with randomly selected words and enough words to give you 100-140 bits of entropy: See also BIP 39
@_date: 2015-08-14 18:13:28
Bip 039 provides a standardized wordlist to use to convert securely-generated entropy to a human-readable human-writable human-memorizable form.  That's basically the definition of a brainwallet.
If I generated a random number, converted it to BIP 039 form, I could memorize it.  If i used that same random number as a private key or as the root of an HD wallet (like mycelium does) then that would be a brainwallet.

@_date: 2016-02-15 22:16:21
Yes.  The difference is that a brainwallet is chosen as some user-selected string, and humans are REALLY bad at selecting "random" stuff.   Entropy is a bitch.
A Mnemonic password is a 128-bit random number, selected *by a computer* that happens to be represented in a number system and symbols that are easy for humans to understand.
As a simple example of what I mean, lets pretend you have a wordlist made up of all 8 colors.    
The random binary string 000010110001001000110000011110110
Was chosen at random, by a computer. It has 33 bits of entropy (that is, 2^33 = 8 billion things would have to be searched before a computer could hope to guess it.)  
It's a somewhat good password (at least better than rain123), but it's hard to remember.  Seriously, try to remember it now.
Now, I'm going to take that number, and group it by 3
    000 010 110 001 001 000 110 000 011 110 110 
Now, turn it into base-8 (2^3) by looking at each group of 3
    0 2 6 1 1 0 6 0 3 6 6
One neat thing about randomness, this doesn't *look* random at all, but it is!
So, now, I'm going to do 0='red',1='blue',2='green',3='yellow',4='orange',5='pink',6='black',7='white'
and represent the base 8 again...
    0 2 6 1 1 0 6 0 3 6 6
    red green black blue blue red black red yellow black black
The number (000010110001001000110000011110110) is the same and would still require the same number of tries to guess, but it's represented in a way that's probably much easier to remember than the binary to the average person.
Now, lets do the same thing, but instead of base 8 we're going to do base 2048 (which is splitting the groups into groups of 11).
   00001011000 10010001100 00011110110 
Then, instead of using 8 colors, we need [some set of 2048 words]( 
    00001011000 10010001100 00011110110
    88 1164 246
    arch muscle burst
From a password strength perspective, "00001011000 10010001100 00011110110" and "arch muscle burst" have the same security...but one is simply easier to remember

11 bits * 6 (for a 12-word seed) or 12 ( for a 24 word seed) is 66 bits of entropy or 132 bits of entropy.  132 bits of entropy is approximately as large as the amount of entropy bitcoin itself (256-bit ecdsa has 128-bits of effective security)., so you have nothing to worry about for the 12 word case.
Lets look at the 6 word case:  66 bits is 2^66 possible combinations.   Checking each combination requires executing 2048 rounds of sha512....which we'll assume is being done by some kind of asic.        That's a total of 2^77 hashes at most to guarantee cracking it, and 2^76 hashes on average to crack it.   
At a hashrate of 5TH/s (which is a single modern asic miner), (2^77 hashes)/(5TH/s)=958 years.   That's actually kind of low, because it means you could easily make it feasible to crack by having as few as 400 miners, and also because there might be a significant speedup on the attack (on the order of 400x-800x) if you exploit a checksum attack to only compute the seed for keys that are guaranteed to be valid seeds.
Personally, I wouldn't do this unless you have less than $10k in bitcoin, because in several years it might be feasible.

They are missing the fact that equivalent functionality can be achieved for a fraction of the price on commodity hardware with no effort using open source software.
This device does literally nothing that another system could do.
1) Do simple cryptocurrency integrations into web or internet-of-things systems: Can be done already with literally hundreds of softwares and services.  My favorite former is python-bitcoin and my favorite later is blockcypher.  Both of which are free!
2) Run on an embedded system:  All of the crypto code to do transactions can be run instantaneously on a RPI (which this thing even USES!)  A RPI is $35 (less if you buy it at scale or manufacture your own SoC)
3) Access a centralized off-chain transaction network:
Here are the following off-chain networks that exist currently and have higher marketshare and an API that isn't vapourware:
Here are some that don't use bitcoin that you might have heard of
google wallet
apple pay
4)  Mine.  Actual miner asics are cheaper and more powerful.  This isn't better for mining than literally anything on the market.
5) Mine on an embedded device:  My cell phone gets shit battery life as it is there's literally NO WAY I would want it to mine, even if it was 10x more power efficient.
6) Mine on an embedded device to produce a 'bitcoin as a system resource'   There's no evidence that bitcoin as a system resource is necessary or even useful, but even if there was it can already be done in software to implement 'bitcoin as a system resource' if such uses were found.  
Another argument being made is that the mining provides a stream of bitcoin like a stream of entropy so that users don't have to go through the effort of buying their own bitcoin in order to have the 'system resource' bitcoin.  Supposing this *was* true for a moment, and supposing this *was* actually valuable, then this miner will consume *power* to generate 5c a day as a 'system resource'.     (at current hashrate/difficulty/etc).
If they made the device 10x *cheaper* magically and priced it at $40 then at 0.05/c a day it would take you 800 days (or ~2.2 YEARS) to get enough bitcoin as a 'system resource' to justify that cost....or, to phrase it in terms that will help you understand why this device is useless for that end: if you had NO power costs at ALL and difficulty didn't increase EVER, for 2.2 YEARS, AND you kept your iphone/embedded 'IoT' device for 2.2 YEARS, you'd still be better off simply pre-loading a software wallet in the OS with 'system bitcoin' EVEN IF THEY MADE THEIR DEVICE 10x CHEAPER.
I'll say that again for emphasis: the 'system bitcoin' argument is bullshit because in a world where the consumer version of their device is 10x cheaper than it is, where the difficulty never increases, where people keep their phones for 3+ years, where people want and need 'system bitcoin' on their phones, where power is literally free, THIS DEVICE IS STILL USELESS.  
Since that world is a fantasy (and in that fantasy world where we stack the deck in it's favor it's still useless) then it's totally useless.

If you want to make an altcoin then forking the reference client (which is C++, C/C++ isn't a thing) is the best idea, yes.  However, I would say there's almost no value in making an altcoin in my opinion, and your time would better be spent learning about the protocol.  


There are a LOT of ways to do it, because there are a lot of possible things you can try to do.  What are you trying to do?


Then in my opinion the most straightforward thing to do is to use a web or websocket API such as blockcypher or blockchain.info.  This is because it's difficult/impractical to run a full node capable of verifying transactions securely on a mobile client.  Web is a little easier (as you can run the reference client on aws and have your frontend call it) but I wouldn't recommend it: the security, complexity, and scalability concerns of safely running the client in the cloud are more complex than you need.


I strongly recommend that you *don't* do this, as I don't really know that it will help you and since your altcoin won't be used it won't have network effects that bitcoin does in terms of cool stuff you can do with it.


Yes. 
1) Read about and understand cryptographic hash functions and why they are irreversable.   Understand entropy.
2) Read about and understand public key crypto as a concept (as in familiarize yourself with the idea of private and public keys and signing as a concept)
3) Use this knowledge from 1) and 2) to understand the idea of how addresses and private keys work in bitcoin.  Read [this](   Write code to walk you through this process.
4) Get a wallet and play with it.  Write code to spend some bitcoins, using an API if you want.
6) Write some code to listen to transactions from the blockchain and respond in some way.  You can use the reference client JSON callbacks or websocket or http callbacks.
7) Read [this in its entirety like 4 times](
7.5) Read [this](
5) Write code to fetch the unspent outputs of an address.
6) Use the code you wrote in 5 to create a raw transaction
7) Use the code you wrote in 6 to *sign* a raw transaction
8) Broadcast that transaction.
9) Use your knowledge to create some kind of bitcoin application.
Congratulations you're now a bitcoin development expert.

Ok? How does this device help that application?
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:25:40
Ok, so here's my cost breakdown for how to assemble a competing device that provides a comparable amount of bitcoin to the system/user instantly on an API call without any user effort:
Step 1:  Get an RPI ($35).
Step 2:  Install a wallet on it, probably with some kernel-layer encryption and security so that the wallet isn't directly accessable to the end user.
Step 3: Pre-Load $165 of bitcoin on it. (currently 0.7174 bitcoin)
Step 4: Ship the device.
My device costs $200, and will be able to provide a total of 0.7174 bitcoin over the lifetime of the device accessible to the user.  
The 21 inc device, [operating at peak efficiency, at current difficulty levels]( will produce 0.38670808 bitcoin a year, and cost $400.  
This means that my device will outperform the 21inc device (with respect to bitcoin availability) unless the user runs the 21inc device at peak efficiency for  0.7174/0.38670808=1.85 years AND my device costs half as much and uses much much much less power.  Of course, my device is also slightly better in that all the coin is always available, but of course we could make it dole it out in small amounts over time if we wanted to simulate the 21inc device's poor performance characteristics. 
The above analysis even assumes that the difficulty remains the same.  If the difficulty increases (which it will) then of course my device will outperform the 21inc's device for even longer.
My device costs half as much, but of course we can more than double the length of time that it outperforms 21inc's device by making my device have price parity with theirs.  This is interesting because it makes my device much more flexible for different use cases...with a 'tiered' model designed for longer or shorter lifetimes.

All of this is already developed and is Open Source.  It's already a part of RPI (Which they use).  Nearly 0 development cost.
Besides, if we are incorporating development cost into our analysis then who do you think spent more on development?  Installing some stuff and configging an RPI? Or all that PLUS a custom asic.


None of that applies to their business model so none of that would apply to mine....unless you are talking about *my* business getting verified and paying for the fees, in which case that has effectively no cost.  Half of a percent in bitcoin and I'm *already* verified.

Maybe they won't *willingly* and maybe it would have to go to a court, but that's what they say in all their regs.  Bitcoin isn't currency because it's not legal tender and thus the exemptions for dealers in foreign exchange don't apply.
@_date: 2015-09-22 18:39:17
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:42:47
I completely disagree. Regulation in the US of bitcoin is actually *much* stricter than foreign currency regulation and is done by different agencies.  FinCEN in particular is a great example, they claim the right to regulate bitcoin even though they *don't* have the authority to regulate foreign currencies because they claim that bitcoin isn't the legal tender of any foreign nation.
If bitcoin became the legal tender of any foreign nation there would be a good argument that they would lose that authority and it would also squarely place bitcoin into a much more well-covered regulatory framework in the US and probably globally.

Depending on where you are, the fastest way is going to be an atm/atm transfer.  I've done this before to send cash fast to a friend overseas and it worked really really well.
Where overseas is she?  Outside the US, atms are prevalent and very user friendly.
Inside the US you might want to do LocalBitcoins or an ATM, but that won't matter because it would be you doing the localbitcoins not her.
Basically, summarized:
Step 0: You (not her) need to install mycelium.
Step 1, have her go to an ATM in her country that allows her to "buy" bitcoin.
Step 2, Text her a picture of your wallet's QR code from MyCelium.
Step 3.  Have her "Buy" bitcoin.  When she puts the money in, it will ask her to show a QR code for the address.  Have her show your address as the picture.
Step 4: You get the bitcoin in your wallet.  Find an ATM that lets you "Sell" or do localbitcoins, or load your debit card.

It really sounds like you don't understand that sellers list their prices in terms of the price per full coin.  This is similar to how the price of gold is listed as the price per full troy oz, or how the price of gas is listed per gallon.
If a seller lists his price as $285.40, then that means that the price is $285.40 for 1.0 bitcoin.  If you want $50 worth of bitcoin, then you tell the seller you would like to purchase only 0.17544 bitcoins (because $50/$285.40 = 0.17544)
Then, you give the seller 50 dollars and they give you 0.17544 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:04:17
I'm about as pro-bitcoin as they come, but I'd like to point out a couple things about this list:


Currently the fee is between $0.50 and $2.00 for most transactions, which is not actually that cheap.  It's more expensive than credit cards for any purchase under $50


In *theory*, if you use perfect security.  In reality, people have had their bitcoins confiscated by the state before.  Usually this is because most people don't practice perfect security.  Think the NSA listening in to gmail and the various CIA wikileaks.  Plus most people store their bitcoin on web wallets like coinbase et. al.   
If the government wants your bitcoin they can get it provided you aren't a crypto expert already.


This is not true.  You need to trust in the miners and trust that no single miner collusion party can get to 51%.  This is a pretty good trust model, and I trust it, but it's not trustless.   
Trust will become even *more* complicated with segwit transactions and working on the lightning network which requires opening and closing transaction channels.


In *theory*, yes.  In *practice* the only way to get bitcoin is to go through an exchange or an ATM, and exchanges and ATMs generally practice some form of AML/KYC (in the US at least).  Even if you buy directly from a seller or localbitcoins (which is a criminal grey area in many states), that person knows who you are and what you look like and what your bitcoin address was, and could identify all of those attributes to authorities if questioned.


Again, this is only if you practice *perfect* security, e.g. offline generated cold storage.  In practice most people use web wallets or phone wallets which are vulnerable both to state actors and malware/hackers.


See above regarding security.


[Try 20 minutes](  Sometimes as long as an hour.
This is assuming you have enough fees to get in one block.  If you mess up the fees your wait time goes from 30 minutes to 3 weeks.


While this is true and is the truest one of your points, in practice it's effectively impossible to make *feature changes* and bugfixes unless you are already on the development team.  This is in contrast to something like firefox where anyone can submit patches and expect them to be introduced into the main branch.


This is true, except in places where there is no internet or it's illegal.


See above.


In practice, exchanges, atms, wallet providers, and payment systems like bitpay are all functioning as intermediaries and they all take a cut.  Sometimes a significant one.  If you want to directly transmit bitcoin to a person who accepts and holds bitcoin then sure, there's no cut, but in any other case there's translation layers and fees.


This is arguable.  It's certainly easier to carry if you practice perfect secrecy (e.g. an HD-brainwallet or memorized seed)...but this is true of credit cards as well.  In terms of movement, it's very difficult to safely get bitcoin out of a paper hd-wallet and spent to a person, considering most people dont' accept it.


This is true, but it doesn't actually help in practice with much.  If it's a feature then you want it to be able to be used to track crime, but since bitcoin addresses can be made anonymous, that's very hard.  If you don't want to be tracked, then it's very bad because it means that someone who wants to mug you can figure out your address by stalking you and watching the blockchain, then they can figure out exactly how much money you have to know how much to demand as they beat you with a pipe.


Bitcoin is *divisible* but I think right now nobody would argue that it's *scalable* with a maximum global TPS of 3.5


Except for the fact that it's controlled by [A group of 8 people](


This is probably a bad thing according to most economists.  Deflation encourages hoarding which encourages stagnation and discourages investment in capital.


Except those 9 people from before, and anyone who hacks your wallet or phone, sure ;)


Yes, you can't chargeback they guy who scams you and doesn't send you the goods after you pay him.   No fraud there whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:39:52
The best way in my opinion is to use bitcoin ATMs.  Depending on the ATM fee it can be VERY cheap and super fast.  I did it with a friend from the US (orlando fl) to South Korea (Seoul).
She needs to find an ATM in Canada (there's a bunch, if she lives in a big city there's probably one near her, use google) and have her partner in australia do the same.
Then her partner hits 'sell bitcoin' and texts her a photo of the QR code that pops up.   
She hits 'buy bitcoin' and when the machine asks for a QR code, she shows the photo of the destination machine.   
She puts the money in the machine, and 1-2 minutes later the machine in AUS spits out cash in local currency.

The pre-signed transaction locks in the destination address, so that the money cannot be spent or redirected, but only sent or not sent to the pre-selected location.

What percentage of 'normal users' do you think generate a mnemonic recovery seed from a copy of a website or script using an offline-only computer copy of a website or script from diceware entropy and destroy the drive after?  0? 0.00001%?  The people who know how to do that are not *Normal* users.  
Most people create a wallet on coinbase to try the bitcoin thingy, or if they have a tech-savvy friend they use something like mycelium on their *phones*.


Again, "possible" is not the same as "normal use".   I don't know *anyone* who didn't get their bitcoin from an AML source or from an in-person transaction. 


I'll give you this one.  I was being a little bit hyperbolic.


Please explain to me how you would use bitcoin to send me money if you have no internet in the congo?


From your link, miners can: 
     Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
    Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
    Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
How is this in practice totally different from government control of the banking system?  90% of the miners can, say, prevent you from sending coins to edward snowden.  There have even been discussions on this forum long ago of ways to use mining software to enforce coin blacklists.


Uh, neither coinbase nor bitpay use escrow by default.  I can't even think of one off the top of my head that *does* use escrow by default.  
Even if that was the case, I think it's pretty obvious that the claim "there is no bitcoin fraud" is absurd on it's face.

In theory, it would have been possible to manufacture the coins with split-key address generation.  basically, make a private key A, send casicus pA=P(A), casicus makes a private key B, then computes p(C)=pA+P(B), puts addr(pA+P(B)) on the coin and puts B under the sticker, funds the address on the coin.
Now nobody but someone who has A can ever access the funds on the coin, because the address corresponds P(A)+P(B), and the corresponding private key would be A+B, which is impossible to generate unless you know both.
Doing this would be sort of nefarious, however, as the 'coin' would be basically impossible to redeem unless you held A

Everyone is naysaying this, but I completely agree with him on all fronts.
People who don't know how bitcoin works, by definition don't have any knowledge of why it is useful.  If they don't have any knowledge of why it is useful, then for them, any knowledge of why it is valuable to others is beyond their grasp.
If you don't have any knowledge of why it's valuable, then for you, investing is just literally the same as a craps roll.  Even if someone else claims to have reasons, even if those reasons are right, your ability to make decisions about bitcoin in those cases is incredibly constrained.

You should use a 12 word seed anyway, not a 24-word one.  The 12 word seed provides the same amount of security as the 24-word one (12 words is 128 bits, 24 words is 256 bits, but bitcoin sec256k1 is only 128 bits of security, so if someone can crack your 12 word seed but not a 24 word seed,they could just bruteforce your private keys instead), and 12 words is possible to remember.

And since no government is currently mandated to do that, the obligation does not exist, and obviously fiat is worthless because it's backed by nothing /s.
In practical usage, when people say "What is it backed by" they are meaning "What service, principle, or good guarantees it's value?" In the case of literally everything, and all currencies, the answer is 'nothing' in a strict sense.  However, obviously, the USD has value and no rational person is worried about it collapsing to 0 purchasing power tomorrow afternoon, so the USD *does* have value because of the faith that it will continue to have value in the near future.

I'm currently trying to set up a crypto consulting business that will work with cryptography and clients (and potentially their estate attorney) to help people do things like this.  Contact me privately and I can help you do this securely.
The easiest way by far is to (in an offline only-machine) encrypt the text of your seed words to your family member's public rsa or EdDSA keys. (  (You can make this for them if you like as long as they keep the private keys safe).   Call this the 'cyphertext'.
 Then, set up a dead-man switch email on google for your gmail account where if it's not active for X amount of days, the ciphertext for that family member gets emailed to them automatically.  Or, put the ciphertext into your will (assuming it can only be accessed anyway by the family member upon your death).
You can even set up a cascade of dead-mans switches to different family members, (like, after 1 month the ciphertext for family member 1 goes through, after 2 month the cipher for family member 2, etc).  This allows a hierarchy of people to get it in order in case the first successor is dead as well (say you and your wife both die in the same car accident). 
You can also do other things like set up N of M RSA or EdDSA keys so that some subset of people (like your attorney AND your wife, or 2 of your 5 kids) have to work together and one person can't violate the will.

Currently, technically, the supply is increasing and will continue to increase until approximately 2140 ad.  Since the supply is increasing, (Money is being printed), you could call this period inflationary.
Of course, demand increase has vastly outpaced the supply increase, so the price has gone up significantly, so you could call this period deflationary.
In 2140, there will be no more produced, so the supply will always go down as people lose their keys, etc.  If demand at this time does not increase, the price will go up, so you could call that period deflationary.
However, according to Krugman and other keynsians, if that happens, then it will never be worth spending your bitcoins because you will be able to count on their value increasing, encouraging you to hodl.  If everyone hodls and refuses to spend, it will be worthless because nobody will spend it on any goods and services. If it becomes worthless, the price will collapse, and you can call this period inflationary.
Hope this helps!

"If the attacker tries to broadcast an old state to cheat the users, then the user is able to broadcast the valid state and sweep all of the coins from the channel."
Doesn't this require all users to continuously monitor the blockchain in order to accomplish this?  Won't this require either all private keys to be online all the time, either with your own node (meaning that you can't keep your coins in a wallet on your smartphone anymore, or in the custody of a custodial service to do the monitoring for you?
Doesn't this also require the ability to make on-chain transactions to close the channel, which (as is admitted here) may not be economically possible? (If it was economically possible to make the on-chain transaction to close the channel to prevent theft, why would you be using LN in the first place?)

Yes but then the only thing that can happen is the intended recipient recieves the funds (and you know exactly who did it and who recieved the funds so they would be caught immediately).  In the wallet password case the funds can go anywhere.


Thats what he said yes.


Again, the big attack vector here is that the executor and the relative can split the funds between themselves or a third party instead of involving the intended recipient.  This is a *much* bigger risk than the risk of sending the funds to the intended recipient at the wrong time.

Wrong.  Money Transmittance is subject to regulation [REGARDLESS of the activity threshold.](


The MSB regulations currently “apply to persons engaged in specified activities that exceed $1,000 for any 
person in any day,” with the **exception of money transmitters, which do not have an activity threshold.** (emphasis mine)
Here is another reference, [Straight from the horses mouth](


Please please please talk to a lawyer.


You'd be [wrong again](


The primary argument they seem to be making is that they are admitting that bitcoin *is* a real currency, which differentiates it compared to your example.  Its not magic cards or goods or services.  Its currency, and buying/selling it is subject to the rules of currency.


Did you even *watch* the Occupy Wall-Street coverage?


They aren't doing nothing.  The feds tell the press it was an underground money-laundering ring operating out of a park, and legally that's exactly what it is.  The press would fucking LOVE that story.

I should warn you that you might get busted by the Feds.  I STRONGLY encourage you not to do this without contacting a lawyer first.  IANAL, but I'm fairly certain this could be considered felony money laundering and operation of an illegal monetary transmission organization according to federal law according to Title 31 and FinCEN guideline FIN-2013-G001 as I currently understand it.  It may also violate article 13-B of the NY banking law.
These charges include hefty fines and possibly jailtime for anyone who buys or sells bitcoin in cash on US soil.  You'd think this would be absurd, but its exactly what happened to Douglas Jackson, founder of E-Gold.
So far there hasn't been much enforcement of this law for local sellers/buyers, but that might just be because individual transactions are usually made quietly between two people who agree to meet over email, and the tracking difficulty isn't worth it.    
Since you are making this so public, with a large group, and/or doing it in a public park, you are at increased risk along with anyone who attends, especially if the feds are waiting to make an example of someone in the bitcoin community.
Not to go all but I'm sure FinCEN representatives are watching this subreddit.  After all, its an important wing of a community of people dedicated to the advocacy of anonymous untracable unlicenced money transfers...they'd be a fool not to pay it a LITTLE attention. 
 However, even if they are not, then having an unlicensed commerce event with cash and fancy electronics in a public park without a permit will certainly attract the attention of the LOCAL police, who will certainly ask you about what you are doing, whether you have a permit, etc, and they will probably follow-up with their superiors to find out.
I STRONGLY urge you not to do this.  The regulatory environment is totally absurd, of course, but until it changes or the legal/financial wing of the bitcoin community finds a way to work around it, you are putting yourself, any compatriots, and even any customers, at significant risk of legal action.  
If you do not think of the risk to yourselves, think of the risk to the community: News coverage this might generate would be highly damaging to the bitcoin community overall.  ("Breaking news: Several arrests were made today during a federal raid of a large illegal money-laundering operation that was operating out of a public park near a playground.  The money laundering was being conducted using transfers to and from the underground hacker currency known as "Bit-Coin", which is often used to purchase drugs and fund terrorism.  Federal authorities say that at least one of those arrested had a cache of firearms in his home in new-jersey.")
Everyone wants local bitcoin exchange to be easy, safe, and legal, and I really hope people are working on the problem...but I think most people in this community want to do what we can to make sure that it happens in a legal way if possible and not send anyone to prison in the process.  PLEASE contact a good finance lawyer in NYC before you go, and if you decide to do it anyway then consider make sure that you have him on retainer.

In contrast, saying "Fuck lawyers man, fight the system" is like going to war without tanks or planes or guns...your effort is admirable, but you aren't even fighting at the same level as your enemy, and you are going to be steamrolled.

Actually, I think a more efficient system would work a lot better:
I agree with you that the problem is fiat-&gt;bitcoin and back.  COMPLETELY agree with you, actually.
However, the problem isn't trading.  Bitcoin shouldn't be traded on giant exchanges.  Bitcoin should be bought like wii points or xbox points at my local CVS or wal-mart.  
It should be fast, legal, and simple to walk into any major retailer, hand them cash, and recieve bitcoin delivered to  my public account, supplied to the cashier as a public key or QR code.
As a bitcoin user, the main advantage is that I *DON'T* need an account at a bank.  I DONT need to maintain a balance, and I DONT need to have any daily bank statements recieved in the mail if I don't want them.
This should be possible and still comply with FinCEN regulations wrt KYC/AML laws.  Such a transaction is not regulated as an exchange, but as a *money transmission*.  As long as you supply a photo ID at the time of transaction, and look it up in a database of known offenders, this is the same as a KYC complience.  I know this is possible: after all, this is *exactly* what moneygram, moneypak, western union, et. al do.
As a bank, you are already licences as an MSB, which is the major hurdle to this kind of business (the point-of-sale device is rather cheap and simple to design...it doesn't have to manage money like an ATM, just accept and dole out funds through the cashier like moneypak and western union...it just has to have a drivers-licence card reader and a secure bitcoin client and a QR code camera).
Major retailers, acting as agents of your MSB,  (by buying and manning one of the POS machines) would maintain all of the transactions, and would be a huge profit potential (as you could take a cut and they could take a cut on both ends of the transaction).   You would never need to maintain accounts on your customer balances, because it would be in their hands the entire time.  Cash in, bitcoin out.
I'm a software engineer with a lot of hardware engineering experience who has studied bitcoin extensively...and I have some ideas on how to design said device.  However, you could contract this device with an engineering firm, or contract it out to the community for open-source (for auditing).
Of course, you could also manage this service from your branch offices.
Either way, the profit to bitcoin doesn't come from yet another exhange, even one backed by a real bank.  Most people don't want or need bitcoin to be a day-trading account or even a paypal alternative.  Most people (myself included) absolutely DO NOT want to give out their bank information to a 3rd party, or even keep a balance in BTC in a real bank account accessable to 3rd parties.
What *I* want, is for bitcoin to be more like a *currency* not stock.  I want to be able to go to banks and currency exchanges and airports and convenience stores and convert $200 USD in bitcoin, like I would do with western union or wii points or Euro.   I want to go to a coffee shop and ask for my change in bitcoin.  I want to be able to pay in bitcoin. 
I want to be able to do this because I want to be able to see something on the internet that I would like to buy, see that the seller accepts "btc-points", and pick some up on the way home from work or while I am getting my groceries.
Bitcoin is iTunes bucks and xBox points, but global and provider-independant.  Its vendor-neutral wii-points with better security than most financial institutions.  Its open-source, standardized, and anyone can accept it,send it, and deal in it for fewer than no fees.
As a non-power user, the REASON I want to use bitcoin is not currency speculation tied to my bank account.  The reason I want to use it is that it allows totally safe, instantaneous purchases online without giving the person I'm sending my full credit-card details or allowing third parties access to my bank account.
Its ideal for buying music, movies, camwhores, clothing, commissioned art, and even just sending  cash for presents and internet tips.
I want to send my niece a birthday present.  I could get her a gift card to iTunes, but what if she doesn't like apple?  I could get her a gift card to amazon, or steam points, or xbox points but what if she doesn't like gaming, or doesn't want anything on amazon?   
I could just send her cash, or write a check, but cashing checks is inconvenient (her mother would have to do it for her) and I'd have to send it snail mail, and cash isn't safe to send in the mail.  Moneygram works, but do you expect a 15 year old girl to pick up that nerdy phone?
You know what would be awesome?  In a hypothetical world where bitcoin can be cashed at any corner CVS, I could go to wal-mart, go to the customer service desk with $60 cash, hold up my phone with a QR code for my public address, and say "Hi, I'd like to buy some bitcoin.".  They pull out the bitcoin point of sale, swipe my ID (to comply with KYC/AML regulations).  My id and QR code for the send code get sent to your (YOUR bank) servers, my id is checked against the KYC database, and a green light turns on on the tells the cashier to accept the funds, and prints out a reciept.   (Your bank's server) recieves the message, takes a cut of the btc, then sends out the bitcoin to the private address.  I walk away happy, you bill the walmart for the accepted funds every month, and I have bitcoin.
I send the bitcoin to my niece, and she gets a nice email for happy birthday with a cool design letting her know I sent the btc to her public account.  She runs to the nearest mall, where she can either 1) pay with btc or 2) if not, go to the nearest CVS/wal-mart where the same process is run in reverse, or she can spend her btc online buying music.  Whatever.
At no point during this transaction did anyone need to connect to a bank account, create a bank account, or hold funds long term in a bank account.
According to fincen regulations, if your bank were to provide this service it would makes you a "money transmitter" but you don't actually need to hold customer funds at any point during the process.  Customers wouldn't NEED to maintain accounts with you, because you are acting as a transmitter and exchanger simultaneously through your MSB agents (using your POS machine).  
Everyone wins: 
Customers win because they can buy/sell bitcoin whenever and wherever they need it, securely, without needing to sign up with a bank.    
Agent locations as retailers (like walm-art and CVS) win because they get to have customers walk in and hand them cash that they (that they keep a profit percentage of) for no seemingly no reason, and all they have to do is keep this funny machine at the customer service counter.
You get to deal in bitcoin, securely, to a massive market, without needing to keep financial accounts and ACH transactions and KYC tracking on each customer.  
FinCEN wins because they gets a drivers-licence scan of everyone who buys bitcoin legally with fiat and how much and when, but they also win because they get camera footage and location data as well for all fiat-bitcoin transactions.
The big thing preventing start-ups from doing this is 1) the MSB transmitter holdings requirements, which, if you were already a bank, is not a problem for you.  2) the design of the POS machine to make it secure and user-friendly.  Talk to the community about this or PM me.

He's basically setting up a table or booth or tent or area or something where people are meeting up to exchange bitcoins for cash.  Anyone who exchanges bitcoin for cash is a money transmitter.

If you are in a position make bitcoin the actual *state* currency of cyprus, this could be an amazing thing.  The main reason is that it would dramatically change the legal position of bitcoin with respect to the united states.  FinCEN guidelines say that because bitcoin is not the accepted currency of any government, then bitcoin exchanges do not count as exchanges per-se and are regulated as money transmitters under the law.  
If bitcoin was officially recognized as the official currency of a nation-state, then under fincen guidelines BTC exchanges would have to be regulated as a currency *exchanges* not as currency transmitters, and regulations for foreign currency exchanges are a LOT less strict from what I can tell.

Maybe, but I'm not sure how thats relevant.   
You are saying, basically.
Take machine A.  On machine A, run an O(n) algorithm with a constant-factor slowdown of 1e9.
Take machine B.  On machine B, run an O(2^n) algorithm with no slowdown.
Wow!  For Large n, B is much much slower!
Thats simply obvious, but when comparing the performance of machines based on something like Hash/sec, the SAME algorithm is used in BOTH cases.  That is because it doesn't tell us anything about the performance characteristics of the machine if we run different software on it.   When comparing algorithms, the big-O complexity matters and can be different, but when comparing hardware, we are interested in saying "Assuming we ran the same program binary on both machines, which one can finish the task faster and why?"  We are trying to measure the relevant constant-factor speedup, which we cannot do if we run different algorithms.
Besides, there's no such thing as a machine which would be able to implement EC point-add but unable to implement EC point-double for some reason.  On any turing-machine, all arithmetic operations can be done in polynomial-time reductions of each-other, and in any real-world computer ever made, it can do both adding and doubling in constant or linear time.

No, its *currently* deflationary because demand exploded, outstripping supply faster than the built-in inflation system could keep up.  You think that the euro NEVER increases in value EVER? 
Over the long term, bitcoin's mining mechanism causes a continuous supply of money to be created out of thin air, at rates proportional to market values and technology.   As a matter of fact, the system is sort-of brilliant and auto-stabilizing because deflation increases the reward for successfully mining, so market forces automatically speed up the inflation rate as deflation increases.
You could see that happening when the hashrate of the network went up significantly when the bubble was going up recently...as the price went up, the profitability of mining went through the roof and miners scrambled to get the infrastructure in place to take advantage of it by increasing inflation.
The only reason it didn't happen here was because there is an inherent delay in getting computing infrastructure on-line, and the bubble just went up so fast that it outpaced market forces.   Now, however, mining is still profitable, so bitcoins are still being created every day.

Why indeed?  [Because *never* in the history of the world have people made businesses and invested money in startups without fully considering the legal ramifications](


From the [Dwolla TOS](


Credit Unions and other bank-like financial institutions have exemption from MSB requirements usually, and have other regulations to cover the same laws...or they take the time to get the appropriate licence.  Dwolla and Paypal and Western Union, etc, seem to be legit.
In contrast, Coinbase seems to simply believe the laws don't apply to them for some reason.


We'll see if the judge agrees that accepting USD from a bank and storing and initiating bitcoin transactions over the internet doesn't count as money transmission.  In the meantime, I'm not going to keep any significant funds there.

I certainly didn't say that.  I'm going to continue to use bitcoin.  I was saying "Don't hold significant funds in 3rd-party systems that are willfully opening themselves up to seizure by the U.S. Government"

How much change came from OWS?  And they were arrested for something identifiable that most people agree with.
If your grandma saw "An illegal money-laundering ring based on the hacker currency Bitcoin was busted today in union square park" on the news, do you REALLY think her first thought would be "Wow, those draconian FinCEN money-laundering regulations are really harming the ability of the free-market to innovate new financial technologies"

Youd have to be 100% certain that the verification data you embedded in the stream was completely and totally indistinguishable statistically from the actual data, which would be pretty hard.
In other words, you'd have to 'verify' the computation for some part of the data at random

In general, I agree with you, but in this case the rules are actually relatively clear:  If you want to run a bitcoin exchange, then you will have to follow the same rules as every other business that handles money.

Go ahead and get arrested for don-quixote-ing up your revolution.  
Meanwhile, the adults will be lawyering up and figuring out how to create legal businesses that work within the system to compete with existing players and to radically change it with new paradigms until they become powerful enough to buy the government and change the rules to be reasonable.
You don't win a chess game by bitching and attacking, you win by analyzing your opponent's moves, minimizing his options while maximizing your opportunities, and using his own rules against him until you come out victorious.  You painstakingly plan all of your battles.
Open-Source became successful because it *used* the law rather than ignoring it.  Historically revolutions are more successful when they pervert the systems of oppression slowly and subtly against the oppressors.  In contrast, revolutions of small groups blindly challenging authorities on their terms while ignoring the risks have been smacked down hard.

Which works great unless a large group of miners are a botnet that is controlled behind the scenes by a small group of people and are either not actually independant agents or are agents forming a cartel.  Then they can collude against you with fairly high probability and there is little you can do about it.
That said, I do like the idea, but at some point paying 5-10x the amount for the computation is prohibitively expensive and even then not perfectly reliable.

This attitude is, unfortunately, why bitcoin will not succeed.  In order for it to be a currency people have to actually want to spend them not hoard them in speculative plenty.   I don't want krugman to be right, but krugman will be

I agree with you that it is not all-or-nothing.  I think my point is that I see an opportunity here where you could, if you were a pre-existing MSB transmitter/exchanger and therefore had less regulatory compliance cost, and you were INTERESTED in bitcoin as a possible venture, break into the bitcoin forex exchange market with retail-based agents for relatively low investment.  My point was that, as a potential user of bitcoin, being able to open a day-trading account in bitcoin interests me very little, but being able to easily purchase them and sell them securely at every store that accepts western union with just cash and a photo ID interests me a GREAT DEAL.   As an MSB, you could easily enter that market with minimal technology investment and a medium amount of marketing.
This would be in *addition* to your current strategy to allow bitcoin banking, if you wanted.
If you don't mind my asking, geographically speaking, where are you located, approximately? 
Im a software and hardware developer who has thought about this a great deal, if you were physically proximal to me I would consider buying you a coffee to chat about it.

Everyone send them email asking them to add a feature to their site......why not just send them bitcoin directly using something like blockchain.info's "send to email" feature?  If they don't accept it then you get it back.  If they DO accept it then boom, mission accomplished.

One big problem is that all scripts are disabled by default except for "standard" ones.  It's like having a cool lua-scripting engine in your video game that ignores all code that isn't exactly the scripts for the game...in theory, it would allow extendability and plug-ins, but in reality it does not.

Yes.  Zeros of sha256 don't 'mean' anything.  A bitcoin block-proof-of work is based on finding Zeros of sha256.  


block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.  (Satoshi 09)


I said 'more or less'.  Blocks are defined by the solutions x to sha256(x) &amp; MASK=0, and new bitcoins can only be created when new blocks enter the blockchain..so bitcoins are minted as 'new solutions' and they exist as repeated hashing on the chain and passed along.  


next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner
and adding these to the end of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of

I think you are misunderstanding some of the theoretical computer science here.  Bitcoin works because it is fundamentally a proof-of-work scheme that is difficult to compute but easy to verify.
However, with research computations they are usually symmetric.  If you knew what the output of the computation was supposed to look like exactly you wouldn't need to do it at all.
Suppose I send you some problem encoded in binary.   You need to read the problem in order to try to solve it, so regardless of what encryption is used at the end of the day you have to be able to execute the code and return the result.  This means you can look at the code.
Suppose you don't actually have time to run the code, so you look at what you think it might be supposed to output, and generate some random numbers that *look* plausible, but are actually wrong and took no computation to actually generate.
I receive these falsified reports from you.  How do I know whether or not they are falsified?  I have nothing to compare them to.  Therefore I am forced to either run the exact same computation you did in order to verify them, or I am forced to simply take your word on faith and pay you anyway.  In both cases I am getting screwed over.
The only possible hope to this is fully homomorphic computing, but so far that is a purely-theoretical pipe dream.

Not as far as I know.  Blockchain.info doesn't have access to your private keys.   However, keyloggers would be just as capable of watching your login information to blockchain, so that doesn't really solve your problem.

"Mining" is a market-based mechanism to increase the money supply.  Anyone can successfully create and keep bitcoins out of "Thin air" if they have computing power to use.  As a matter of fact, the more deflation that occurs, the more incentive there is to mine, meaning that more money gets created, meaning that there's a negative-feedback loop on deflation (at least until all the bitcoins are found).
Basically, miners tell their computers to try to brute-force solve an hard computational problem that is mostly meaningless.  The bitcoins are 'solutions' to this problem (more or less).  If your computer manages to solve the problem, you get to keep the bitcoins you've found.  
In this way, bitcoins are sort-of tied to the cost of computing technology and electricity.  As long as bitcoins have more value than the equivalent electricity cost of running a computer to solve the bitcoin problem, more bitcoins will continue to be created out of thin air and the total money supply would go up.  If all other prices were stable, then this would result in inflation for bitcoin.   
However, bitcoin also can go through deflationary periods as well, because if demand for bitcoin outpaces supply, then of course the price will go up.  However, the higher the price of a bitcoin goes up, the more inherent reward there is to mine, and more and more people will try to mine faster and harder.  
EDIT: Typo, I said the money supply would go down...the money supply would increase.

It could be, but if the site operators are small potatoes or not newsworthy enough or the transactions are small enough then its not a tempting enough target.  The sellers on localbitcoin are *certainly* committing a crime imho, but since they are small transactions and are mostly anonymous they aren't worth pursuing.
However, if FinCEN wants to make an example out of bitcoin and flex their muscle, a public organization of people who are basically posting confessions online and who are all agreeing to meet in a public place to commit a crime together would make a mighty newsworthy target.

Actually, I talked to them, and they specifically say that "Certain Scripts will be enabled on a case-by-case basis"
Going with the analogy, its as if you have a lua-scripting engine in your game, but plugins will only be allowed to run after a careful consideration of each plugin, and only after that plugin has been asked for by the users.
That kind of restrictive "You'll only run what we say you run" is extremely prohibitive to any kind of open-platform development.  That's not to say its a bad idea...I agree that when real money is involved its not necessarily a good thing to encourage random scripts on the network...but its certainly not going to facilitate the type of development that OP is talking about.

In contrast, a kickstarter to found a legal foundation to register as an msb and supply anyone who wants with a machine to allow them to exchange bitcoin legally as a registered agent of the msb would be awesome.
