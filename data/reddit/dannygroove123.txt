Im using bitcoin qt 
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:50:56
I also have a very strong encryption password for my wallet. My address is this one: 1A7N9qMeWehtihydMgLsJmxhymTs3AeAFL
Im sure it hasnt been infected or compromised.

I did not know that we had 100 addresses as default. I did the rescan, took 4 hours to do it, and now im 9 days behind, but what confuses me is that my wallet says something and block explorers say something different.

Ok, so my 12 BTC are back, thankyou very much! however, I have 5.4 BTC sitting as unconfirmed, what might that be? 
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:19:18
Well, in that case I'd prefer to have further assistance, noob here. :)
@_date: 2014-08-21 17:57:37
Ok I will wait then, maybe half an hour left, how much does a block weight?
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:57:06
Thanks for this information, we all learn new things everyday
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:05:36
Almost done, 6.06 BTC appeared
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:21:32
Ok, then enlighten me please. Any link that might help?
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:03:58
Thank you very much, still shows as unconfirmed tho, 800 blocks to go.
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:52:16
It spited a key for each change address of those.

This is the only computer where I use my wallet, and have never turned off my computer before shutting down the QT first. Im still 8 days away (Yes, I have a shitty internet connection) and my bitcoins are sitting as unconfirmed. If the bitcoins changed addresses or something shouldn't that be reflected in the transaction history tab? The -6.1 and -6.3 doesnt show up.
@_date: 2014-08-21 17:21:37
Yes, I made those payments with my wallet: 0.16 and 0.286. But the change went to those addresses whom I not control. I only have 4 addresses on my wallet. I use the qt ver 0.9... 
I first noticed this problem while I was sending 0.5 BTC to an exchange and the transaction appeared to be conflicted, note that I used the wallet without syncing cause there shouldnt be a problem with that.
