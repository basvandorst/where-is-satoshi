What should the value do then, when more people want to play and the resource is limited, you can not just print a few more billions like with fiat?
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:20:09
Yep, it doesn't.  
This is why you should invest in Bitcoin ONLY if you understand where its value comes from and you actually want the product.  
  
My gf's bank accounts were frozen because of unpaid debt. She had the money to pay it off, in her bank account, but they froze her bank accounts. So what do we do now? She can't access her own money.  
She had to borrow money from friends to pay her debt so she can get her account unfrozen to pay off to her friends..  
It just sounds redicolous to me that she didn't have access to her own money.  
  
So, yeah, I want Bitcoin. I want other crypto as well.  
I do want my bank account as well, but I just don't want my life's savings there as I don't trust entities with much bigger influence and lawyer's budget.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:40:34
Yes and no.  
I look at my money as time.   
How much time would I need to save the amount X.  
I think I would need 6 months to save the money I have in BTC.  
6 months is considerable time but it isn’t either 20 years.

I am from Eastern Europe - we have fees for every transfer between accounts, we also have fees for withdrawals from ATM and at the branch.  
Max you can withdraw from an ATM is 200 euros and they charge you 0.5 flat fee.  
Have in mind minimum wage here is 200 euros.
So if you want to withdraw your salary on one go you pay 0.25% withdrawal fee.  
Doesn't sound too bad.  
However most people I know, especially older people, withdraw multiple times a month - 10-50 euros per withdrawal, without realising these fees stack up.

Great advice.  
The whole not pushy way is really good, to let it sink over time and it will speak to you differently over time.  
I’ve been already subscribed to it and read a lot of content from it.  
It’s a good subreddit, but not for me, at least not for this part of my life.  
I am still at phase where every year I double my income.  
I prefer to keep myself as happy as I can be and work on my self (study new tech) so I can double my income again next year. Once I hit a brick wall and I feel like I can not increase my income substanceously it would make sense to me to start saving more. As even if I go hard on saving today - what’s the point of doing so if I can save double that next year? And I can do that only if I don’t go full on savings as I have lots to study yet which can be costly / time consuming.  
Anyway, went too much into my persona story.  
  
Resubscribing to it though :)

She had in her account multiple times the money she owed.
She could've paid them ages ago, but was abroad for years and forgot about the loan.
No letters ever received, as she doesn't have a property.
I am fine with freezing the account, taking the money diretly, etc, but being forbiden from using the money in the account to pay off the loan? What?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:36:51
I think that Bitcoin is still undervalued. So I don't think that $10k, neither $20k is a fair price.  
Just as a store of value.  
  
When we add Lightning network and the usability it brings the value of BTC is even higher. Much higher than the current 10-20k.  
So I expect much higher price because of these two personal opinions.  
If I am wrong or right - time will tell.  
RemindMe! 3 months "I think Bitcoin has a lot more to grow, was I right? Remind as well."
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:56:55
The restriction was because of the loan, nothing else.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:02:13
So you are saying is that no one should have bought at 19k? Then how would the price had hit 19k? It can't unless someone buys.  
If one did he just have to wait it out, thing "long term" and wait end of 2018 where price should be at least where it was at the end of 2017.

That's the thing you are missing. They didn't take the money off of her bank account. They didn't let her use the money to pay to loan as well.  
Why? Why can't she use her money to pay the loan?
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:51:35
Because US$ is being printed out by the billions every week? And the trend is that they are printed faster and faster are times goesby?  
If someone buys Bitcoin as an investment, not for utility (as there's none right now), you look a little bit further ahead than today.

If our friend is poor since 2011 - for 7 years in a row now, then he is doing something wrong.  
And yes, sometimes sacrifices got to be made so you can improve your financial situation.  
My mother went to sleep hungry many times so her two boys have something to eat. And she always told us that she just isn’t hungry.  
Looking back now, as an adult, I just realise that she was just a good parent and was ready to sacrifice her own comfort for her kids. Also knew how important it is to lie to them so they don’t feel bad.

I will remind us both what happens in 3 months - is it closer to 20k or 5k.  
RemindMe! 3 months
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:20:22
We are financially fine. Both have good jobs and make over average income.  
The freezing didn't cause that much discomfort as frustration.  
It's not fair freezing $10k in bank accounts, because she owes $1k (example numbers).  
Freezing $1k until things gets settled sounds fine - either she signs the paper that the $1k gets transferred or she pays otherwise.  
But freezing everything she owes - for a fraction of what she has... that's just plain stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:42:06


Yes you are.  
However you are trusting them with X amount of money - the one that you send them to buy with.  
Let's say I want to buy 100k worth of BTC.  
I wouldn't send all 100k at once.  
I would make a bank transfer for 10k, buy BTC for 1k, withdraw to my wallet and only AFTER deposit again - maybe 20k on the next round.  
  
I don't mind trusting third party. As long as it's temporary.  
I can leverage risk and just split my transactions in multiple batches so I can't lose everything if I trust the wrong people.

I doubt it anyone bought at any price without considering the risk of the price going down.  
Now on the bear run people bought at 12k, 11k, 10k and 9k.  
All of them knew that it might go even lower - 8k, 7k, etc.

Escalate your ticket on the form I've linked. It helped me when I had a problem with funds not appearing.  
Also have in mind that Kraken's faily volume is 30k+ bitcoins, you can get the idea how much is that in $$. They don't want to close down their website after they get your $12k.

Motivated her? Sue her and make the court deal with it.  
Having to take loans when you have the money sounds wrong to me.  
As you don't have access t oyour own money, what?
  
EDIT:  
What if she didn't have friends to give her loan?   
I would accept not able to use the funds for anything else than paying off the loan, but not even for that?

Perfect!  
She had x10 the money she owe. They didn't take them. And she couldn't use her money to pay off the loan, had to find external source of money to pay off.  
That's what I disagree with.  
Automatically take the money - fine.  
Freeze the account - fine.  
Not able to sign a paper and make a bank transfer to the person she owes money and she has the money? Not fine.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:17:56


Segwit is optional. Not everyone has a stimul to generate a Segwit address and transfer his funds there - which costs time to do and money in fees to transfer.  
Now if you tell me that my wallet can easily get hacked unless I transfer my funds I am sure people would do it ASAP.

hahah :)  
  
joke a side, seriously though, I don't think Bitcoin is dead, it's just having "rough" time by tracing back it's price 2 months back. Like big deal. A lot of work is being done on the tech, it's evolving, improving, it will go higher than before in price. I see no reason not to do so.  
I mean, for all the people who don't see the value in crypto / bitcoin - ofc there will be no reason to go ever higher than 20k, but that's irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:17:48


Yes. Because the amount in the bank account is multiple times the amount she owes.  
If she owes $1k, it sounds fair to me that the bank freezes $1k until this gets settled - either she agrees that the $1k goes to the person she owes or she pays otherwise. Or sue each other until this gets figured out, does anyone owes anyone anything.  
But freezing, for instance, $10k as she owes $1k? No, that doesn't sound right to me.

Yes and now.  
If he invested a year ago, as he said, and buy 1 Bitcoin at $700 price he had pleeenty of time to cash out at least his initial investment.  
I mean, if you sell 0.1 Bitcoin when the price was $14k, not at the peak of nearly 20k, you would double your money in a year and still have 0.9 Bitcoin as leftover.   
So happy? Nah.
Hell, he can even now at 11k price sell 0.1 btc and get his initial investment + some profit and still have 0.9 left LOL 
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:46:56


Absolutely correct. That's why I haven't put most of my money in Bitcoin.  
However I've put enough that in the next 12 months even if it goes to 25k and I sell at that price it would net me more "interest" than all the deposits I have currently in my bank accounts.  
As the interest rate of banks is so low and I don't have enough to purchase a property, I just prefer to put 10% or so in Bitcoin.
Worse case scenario - I lose 10% of my savings. I am young, don't have that much savings anyway, and losing 10% would be like if I took an expensive trip somewhere.  
However, if Bitoin bounces up - as it always has so far, it would literally make me more profit than all my other savings are accumulating for me right now.

I remember the comment from Satoshi, that was explaining exactly how the more people get in, the more the price goes higher, which gets more people in, therefore creating possitive loop.

I am IT professional - employment is really not a possibl problem for me.  
I still have an emergency fund though - me getting into a hospital wont get me in trouble, got month's worth of rent + food in the bank account.  
If I really wanted to I could save the money I got in Bitcoin in let's say 4 months, but I don't feel like saving on food/clothing/etc.

As I said - the US$ is being printed faster, in bigger quanitites, every year. Bitcoin is being mined slower with every 4 years.  


  
What is that? What is the reason?  
I see Bitcoin as digital gold + digital cash.  
I can spend it, but also it's an investment that gains value over time, as it's scare.  
I prefer to owe some of something with limited supply than to owe only something that every single day gets devaluated.

Alright, so how did the price of btc ever hit $1? How did it hit $100? $1k? How if it doesn't have any inherent value?  
There's a reason why it will go back up - because $10k is cheap for this asset.  
Because the network is growing, the tech is evolving and maturing and Bitcoin is going to hit 100k sooner or later.

I am in Crypto only since 6 months ago.  
At the beginning all I cared was what is the price of Bitcoin in USD.

I buy alts with BTC, I sell alts for BTC - with one simple target - increase my BTC holdings.  
I sell btc for USD as well and then I buy again - with the only idea to get more BTC.  
I stopped careing how much it is in USD, I just want to increase my percentage of a BTC.

@_date: 2018-01-02 09:44:26


  
That is half true.  
Let's say you have 10 coins and 10 people.  
If you have 10 new people price will go up as there's no only half a coin per person - it all makes sense.  
However, let's say there are no more than 10 people on the planet.  
The coins will be redestributed among those 10 people, one might have 5 and the other ones to have half each, or a few people to have 2 each and the other to have less than a half coin, etc.  
How much it's valued in FIAT (and why in Fiat? What about in cars or houses directly?) could go up or down depending on how much is the utility and the desire to hold exactly bitcoin.  
It's about how secure it is, easy to use, how high the fees are, how many merchants accept it - etc.  
All of the above is still work in progress and at the very beginning - fees are high, can not do many transactions per day, not many merchants accept it, etc.  
IMO when ^ that is fixed the price will go up even if no new people join the "ponzi", just because I would prefer my money to be in Bitcoin instead of my bank. Why? As now I am paying $10 for international transfer with my bank. If it's $0.01 with Bitcoin - gimme gimme!

Yes.  
As it has limited supply and US$ is constantly being printed at faster phase.  
It's just like the price of everything - it doesn't go down, it only goes up - because of inflation and the more money being printed every single minute.  
However Bitcoin is limited in supply, not like candy, so it's speed of going up in price is faster.

Why is that gambling? Because you can not affect in anyway the outcome of the roulette neither can you know what would be for certainty the next number.  
With Bitcoin I research who is invested into it, what is the opinion of much smarter than me people about it.   
Who works on it, what is in current development? As this is an ongoing, under active development software product.

I am far away from retirement.  
I am convinced that Bitoin is going to go to 100k. Why wouldn't it? Is 20k really THE HIGHEST it will ever go to? You think so?  
Every time I have doubts I watch the [And then it crashed all the way down to..]( video. As that's the reason I bought in Bitcoin in the recent months in the first time - I've knew about Bitcoin since it was $2. I never bought because I always heard about it after a recent price spike and I always thought I missed my train. But it proved me wrong again and again as it always goes higher, until now, the 20k. Statistically speaking, chances that it will never pass 20k are quite low. I like those odds. Prefer to throw my money at Bitcoin than at lottery tickets.

I've started with 2%. Added another 2%. Then 5%. Then another 5%.  
I've total put about 30%.  
That 30% grew up to be 60% on its own now.  
So I can cash out and get easy doubling 30% of my savings.  
However I do believe this is much bigger and the doubling of 30% is nothing compared to what's coming.  
I do believe in btc 50k by end of 2018, a million withing a few years (possibly 2020).  
I am not selling until I have enough to buy a house and once I do I will be rebuying as fast as I can to what I was before.  
And if I see it growing too fast I might even decide against putting my money in a house, by 100% cashing out of btc, as it might be much better to continue paying rent.  
However I guess if 10-20% of my crypto becomes as much as enough to put a downpayment for a house I will do that - double win - I still have plenty in crypto and have secured profit in terms of house downpayment / deposit!

I completely agree with you.  
I want to created a Segwit address for my Ledger hardware wallet, howevr the exchange I use do not allow sending money to a Segwit address :/ so I would have to pay two times fees when withdrawing - ones to my normal address and then transferring to my hardware wallet Segwit address :/  
  
Business should really put some effort into this and improve.  
  
I was thinking about the batching recently. Didn't know if it's possible.  
I was thinking how when an exchange is sending away coins to people who withdraw they should do it with one transaction if possible.  
Are you sure they are not doing it currently?  
I guess it varies from exchagne to exchange.  
The last withdraw I've done I noticed that a lot of coins were send to a lot of different addresses, mine was just one of them.

I don't get it.  
So what exactly did you do?  
Seeing the price spiking from 12k onwards to 13+ you transferred your money from your wallet to the exchange, waited for a big spike of the price - 19k, sold, now sending back to your wallet, and ones when the price goes down to 15k you are going to rebuy?  
Isn't that a lot of transaction fees to pay?  
  
I've done only one sell high rebuy low, but it was with quite the fees and the mempool was much more empty than it is now.  
Now you literally got to pay $200 in transaction fees in order to get your transaction done ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:20:15
What you are saying makes sense if you are 5 years old.  
I am sorry for "coming at you" but what you are saying is so incorrect to me that I am just not sure if you are serious or trolling.  
  
Here's why:  
You said that "Bitcoin is highly overpriced due to manipulation by whales". Ok. Very interesting.  
Then you say: " whales to drive the price up. As more and more people see the price go up they hop on board and funnel their real $ for bitcoin"  
How the fuck did the Whales higher the price if not exactly in the same way buying Bitcoin from ME, and the other who had it before them, at HIGH price?  
Let's say the price is $10k. A whale wants to higher it. What he has to do is to BUY (with REAL MONEY, not fake monopoly  money lol) all the SELL order up to let's say $12k - so by investing a few millions he successfully increased the price from $10k to $12k.  
Now you say that "the regular Joe" starts buying as well, "withe real money", and drives the price to $14k.  
But then there's this DIP to $13k (like the one we had to $18k today) and you said THE WHALES put a buy wall so the price doesn't go down - well they freaking used real money for it, didn't they???  
Then you say: "Now that more $ is in the ecosystem, whales can use that $ to cash out at the price they’ve inflated and once they no longer are able to manipulate the market as their stake in it is gone, then nothing will be there to stop when it goes down (like the buy walls they’ve been putting.)"  
Are you for fucking real here? If they inflated the price from $10k to $20k and they decide to cash out - the price will collapse to $1k REAL FAST that they wont be able to sell even 10% of what they bought earlier at $15k or more, as the price will be falling so fast there wont be buyers and they will sell most of what they bought at $10k and above - with the support buy walls at 13k, 18k, etc, they now will sell at $1k a peace - loosing money.  
You said it yourself - the buy walls don't let the price fall. If it's these whales that keep it from falling - some people who want to pump and dump, the moment they start trying to dump the price will be in free fall so fast that they wont be able to get any money back as THE BUY WALLS that they used to put are not there anymore.  
Do you see now how you contradict yourself?

Sadly, yes.  
But we are all participating.  
If we say NO to the high fees and refuse to pay them there will be no transactions and fees will be back to 0.  
We are just wasiting space on the blochain for no good reason IMO.    
As well as someone spamming it so he clogs it.  
But this attack would be dealt with if he actually starts paying for the spam transactions instead of them being returned back.

It's gonna go back to 16k soon. Don't worry.  
I just started another bank transfer, so I can buy sub 15k hopefully. 
 
And the other thing is - BTC will go over 20k in January.  
So if you buy on 14k, 15k, 16k - it's all irelevant. If you want to sell - wait for the big spike in January.  
However I am a believer in BTC = 1mln in a few years. So I wouldn't sell more than what I just need to pay my rent / food / bills / etc.

Are you telling them that they should stay away from crypto if they don't have a few grand laying around?  
  
Maybe to you $2-5k is pocket money. To some people that's more than they ever had in their bank account.  
Just yesterday there was the story of that guy who never had any savings, but crypto made him start saving so he buys it and now he has about $13k in crypto or whatever it was + he cashed out some and paid off an old $5k credit card debt.  
Again - he never had $2k in his bank acc prior to getting involved with crypto.  
Don't be judgemental on how much people have or tell them not to invest if they don't have at least X amount.

I've bought at ATH (All Time High) multiple times.  
Bought at 5k, at 6k, at 7k, at 9k and lastly at 11k.  
Do you think I regret not waiting for the dip?  
  
If you think the price has go down to 9k euro before you you buy in it means you don't expect the price to go to higher than it is now.  
Which means you shouldn't be buying Bitcoin, as you think it's a gamble that MIGHT go back to where it is now, but definitelly wont go much higher.  
If that's ^ what is your thinking never put money into Bitcoin.  
  
I think it's going to 1mln $ in a few years and more after that and that's why I don't have issues buying at all time high every 2 weeks when I have the money.  
  
Also you say it needs to go down to 9k euro for "you to get interested".

Bitcoin is the most secure database in the world today.  
What a better place to put your money than in it?  
Bitcoin is censor free - no goverment can freeze your account, stop you from transacting or steal your money. It's yours and ONLY YOU can control it. Period.  
I've seen goverments taking money off of bank accounts, stealing property from people and what not. This is impossible with Bitcoin.  
This is the best ELI5 I can do as to WHY Bitcoin has so high value TO ME.  
If you want more info, ELI10 - youtube videos, there's plenty with good explonation.  
WHY it will go over $1mln? Because more people will realise it's value and will want in. However the supply is very limited, so the only way for people to get in would be to pay more. At the moment 1 out of 1000 people have any crypto.  
When this number is 1 out of 10 people BTC will be worth a million dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:17:18
Thanks a bunch for clarifying!  
Why an ok fee would be 80 to 100 though.  
There's a really small amount of uncomfirmed transactions at 90-100 bracket.  
And 81-90 is already in 0 blocks in.  
  
Is the difference between paying 20 sat per and 40 sat per exactly double?  
Meaning, if I am paying $2 for a fee of 20 sat per, if I jump my fee to 40 sat per it would be exactly x2 = $4?  
So if I put 10 sat per, the difference between that and 80 sat per is exactly 8 times, so if I am about to pay $0.50 for a slow transaction I can otherwise pay $4 for a fast one, correct?

Just the other day I've posted this [Guide: How to make the FEES on Bitcoin extremely high for everyone on the network](  
The network can be spammed because sooner or later the spammer's transactions are clogged and people start overpaying.  
The only way to hurt whoever is spamming it to stop transacting so his transactions actually go through and he actually pays the fees.  
Anyone with lots of BTC can do this.  
Coordinated Media FUD (Bitcoin is wrothles BTrash is the REAL BITCOIN, I am the CEO of Bitcoin (.com) - trust me, I am abandoning ship, better follow me) + spam on the network to higher the fees + some paid for complaining on and you are in business with spreading bad mouth about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:07:01
No, no, I searched for it on the app store, I didn't download it from bitcoin.org.  
Also by trust I mean that I haven't lost my funds so far, so hopefully...  
While with a new app - it literally takes a few lines of code to just log my 12 words and / or send them + my private keys to certain API endpoint that records them.  
So this is what I mean by trust, I just haven't been scammed by Electrum so far, while I don't know this app = not trusting it.  
It's not about Desktop VS Mobile.  
I get it that there's less chance of a virus on Mobile, however it's about the app itself and what it does.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:21:01
About same.  
The more it rises the more I put in.  
Which makes my next and next investment less of a bitcoin and less of a bitcoin, BUT if it doubles it doubles.  
I am thinking once I get to x5 profit, HOPEFULLY, to cash out 20% so there's no pressure about lost money, just lost potential / imaginary earnings.

You didn't answer my question though - did you send to exchange, sell, once the price dropped  rebuy, move back to your wallet?

But I do like the cashing posts.  
But mainly of people who bought 2-3 years ago, hit their moon - but a real moon, like paying off the mortgage, and cashed out 20-50-100% of their coins.  
Like that guy who cashed out 30% out of his 1.5mln worth of btc.  
I would do that as well if I was there.  
I am so happy for these people who cashed out, all or some, and got their lives improved.  
Hope to be there one day, so want to read about other people's success stories.  
Bitcoin is really like a pyramide scheme - you put some money in and you get insane returns.  
Difference is, there's no central point on it, someone who moves the money, and that can run away with your money at some point.  
It's just a bunch of people who want a peace of the pie called decentralized, unseizable money.  
I just hope one day when I moon I can just buy a house with BTC instead of cash out to Fiat first.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:30:05
I honestly didn't see it coming.  
I knew the mempool is full. I take a look at it every single day. I knew why it's full. I knew it could get worse. However it just doesn't bother me much. Why? Because I know that it's worked on.  
I know that I might need to wait for a solution and I am fine with it.  
I bought Bitcoin because it's the money of the FUTURE not today's money.  
It just doesn't have the network technology behind it to make it possible today.  
But very smart people, much smarter than I am, are working very hard on it.  
So, I didn't see a dip all the way down to 12k.  
I thought about selling some of my satoshis when the price was nearly 20k so I can realise some profit, so I can secure at least a little bit my initial investment.  
As I was buying over time, every week or two, I've put my money gradually.  
So I though, maybe I should be taking them out gradually as well.  
Something like take 10% ones I've doubled my money according to BTC current price.  
Then ones the price of the owned BTC is 250% of the value of the money put in cash out another 10% of the initial investment's worth of BTC so now I am risking only 80%, while having about 90% of the initially bought BTC, etc, etc.  
However I didn't cash out any at near 20k.  
Now I've changed my opinion as we already had our "correction". I am not cashing out any until 30k, as I don't see another big dip until another big number like that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:06:13
I bought lastly at 16k. A lot. I am confident we will be back at 20k soon.   
The tech is there, it’s going to happen, just some weak hands, a lot of FUD, some whales playing, possibly shorting.   
This is going to be history soon.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:51:12
Thing is that if you cash out today at 15k and lets say you bought at 3k (which was Bitcoin's price mare 3 months ago) and putting in 50% of your savings, that 50% is now worth as much as  90% of your savings.  
If you cash out 40% not only you got your investment back, but also you made some decent profit.  
Issue is, if Bitcoin goes to 30k by the end of the year and again you cashed out 40% however when the price is 30k you would've get your investment back, made much bigger profit and still have the same amount of BTC.  
I do believe in Bitcoin in the very long term.  
So to me I don't want to cash out more than 20% at any time.  
And I would do so only once the price is x5+ my investment, so I get my initial investment, however without messing up my BTC holdings which I believe will be Mooning again and again for long time.  
I am 80% of my savings in.  
It's a big preasure to cash out and be safe.  
I am at about x2 if I sell out today.  
However if I cash out 50% so I get my investment back and it goes to 30k by end of the year I could've cashed out only 25% of my btc instead of 50% to get my investment back :/

I think that the higher the fees are getting - the more profitable it is to mine.  
The more profitable it is to mine the more new players want in on the game.  
The more players get into the game the less likely for the attackers it is to create the new blocks and get the rewards, so eventully they will be waisting money on nothing, as they are not getting the new blocks.  
However an attack from BCash would be cheap to do 0 spam transactions with price up to 10-20 satoshi per byte which would most probably be never run and falsely keep the fees high in Bitcoin.  
If you don't mine but want to keep the fees high you kind of can do that, no?  
As there's always enough transactions and enough people that want theirs done SOON.  
I guess this would be solved with off chain scaling.  
  
Let's say we increase the block size to X mb so the mempool gets cleared out, right?  
What happens next is even bigger spam that sooner or later again will generate high enough fees that even with full blocks the normal users would need to pay the currently high fees.

I've read this advice a few times, maybe it was your comments, however I've already transfered all to it...

When Bitcoin is $1mln you will be regretting not buying at sub $20k.  
And if you think that Bitcoin isn't going to $1mln - then don't buy.  
You apparently don't believe in the tech, don't understand what it is and WHY it's going to go over $1mln.  
If you think that buying at $15k might be late, as it MIGHT but might not go back to $20k so you can flippity dippity and sell back at $20k for some profit - you are missing the bigger picture here.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:50:04

I think so as well.  
I think a lot more money is coming with features in 2018 so I don't think BTC is going down to 5k, 2k or less.  
I think BTC is going to shoot to 30-40k and then crash to 15k.  
Unless Tether turns out to be bigger than I expect and 2 major exchanges get hacked, I don't think anything can stop BTC from going up now.

I am so greatful to people who actually contribute to the world of Crypto and help make it real.  
I feel like some people are not greatful enough, or maybe just the ungreatful half of us are more vocal.  
Anyway, what I am saying is - A BIG THANK YOU! From all of us, the unvocal people who actually every day think about how much we are being given for free and how much we have to do good in the world to repay this goodness done to us.  
Thanks, wish you best of luck in your personal life and obviously work related endeavours :P  
Please if possible do some more Media exposure - we need it. Ver and company are really striking on the Bitcoin name, they want it bad, and LN are one of the pillars that keeps Bitcoin up.  
Without LN we are worse than BCash. Literally. Because LN is the scaling solution we expect. I truly believe in it, however many people don't get it at all why is it better to "over complicate" with second layer isntead of on chain 100gb blocks.

This doesn't is not what I said.  
What you are saying is about provider quiting his business.  
Bitcoin isn't giving up on Fees. Bitcoin community is developing scaling soltuion - Lightning Network.  
  
What I am saying is that you can't complain if you have to wait for your transaction or you have to pay high tax for it if you are already rich thanks to Bitcoin.  
  
You can now either just wait out for the developers to finish the work they are doing FOR FREE or you can help them out with either testing or development.

@_date: 2017-12-18 01:00:52


Why? Because they can.
I think so as well.  
It cost them nothing to spam the 0 fee transactions.  
And it will cost them close to nothing to spam the 5s per.  
Ones you do that people start bidding on 10, 20 and more.  
Hell - people are paying 500+ lately!! WTF.  
Even if you spam 50 transactions at 10sat per, eventually if the mempool drops and you actually pay for them (which might never happen as the transaction gets dropped) while you succesfully pushed the price of the fees up.  
And if you check - usually 300-500 sat/b the transactions that are always in the next block.  
Which means that even if just 5% of all currentlty waiting transactions are at those fees at the current moment, actually as they are being replaced with new ones in the next 10 minutes it would mean that MOST of the transactions completed/signed are the ones with the extremely high fees.  
This is really messed up.  
  
Look at the mempool right now:   
Even though A LOT of transactions are in the 20 to 70 satoshi per byte brackets, the ones that are actually included in the next block are the ones with 400+.  
And by the time the block is created - new ones replace their place!  
If they weren't the price was going to be back to normal.  
  
It's either miners doing it, either BCash atack.  
  
The argument for more people buying Bitcoin is invalid - as most are noobs that keep them on the exchange, they don't do transactions on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:19:08
... as Bitcoin will be 1 trillion and you have only 0.000000001 btc.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:55:24
Isn't higher demand driving the price up?  
You have a degree in finance and you don't get that?  
Every single day the amount of NEW PEOPLE who want to buy Bitcoin is more than the new people from yesterday.  
So demand goes up and up while production goes down and down.  
This is what drives the price up, nothing else.  
Now, WHY more and more people want some Bitcoin - that's a completely different topic and is not the same question as to "why something worth penny some day is now worth 19k".
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:38
I did that.  
When it hit 11k.  
I knew a dip is coming, as it went from 8k to 9k in a week, 9k to 10k in 2 days and then 10k to 11k in 12 hours.  
I was sure this trend can NOT continue, so I sold at 11k, the dip was down to 9k, rebought at that and made 15ish % profit.  
However... as I don't keep my money on an exchange I had to pay x2 fees for transactions, take the risk of messing up the addresses and taking the risk of deciding wrongly when is the dip.  
I didn't mess up anything.  
However now I am not sure. I don't have that gut feeling that a dip is coming RIGHT NOW, as I had it at 11k.  
Also, look at this shit:   
Even if I want to I can't transfer my BTC back to an exchange unless I pay $100 for the transaction and lose how my profit from 
"selling high buying low"  
So I will wait out this one.  
  
I don't get it how people can even sell/buy constantly. So they keep their money on exchanges? Not afraid of loosing all their money when something gets hacked?  
Not your keys not your bitcoins people say, still many people use Exchanges as a wallet. Hmz...

Damn, I can relate.  
I am invested about 6 months of savings. Not that big, but definitelly could've spend it on a lot of fun.  
However I am not afraid of loosing it all - I can live without it.  
But I am already proud - Bitcoin made me save and HODL.  
This is the true test I guess, haha. I have no intentions to sell until I can buy something big, like a property, with my satoshis.  
Until then - if it goes to 0, well, it was a fun ride.  
I've seen the crash in 2013, the dip from 1200 to 100, lol, what's happening now is irrelevant to me.  
I've "missed the train" so many times with Bitcoin - all the jumps to $100, $1200, $2000 - at $3k I said I am going in.  
My last purchase was at $16k.  
I don't care. I am not selling until I either make big money, if not - I lose it all, I can live with that.

My argument is that while Z is uncertain, Y is very real. Today.  
You might have put X yesterday, but if the price went up and that X is equal to a cash out today of Y - you are gambling certain Y, not just the X.  
  
And, yes, of course, reason I am not cashing out Y today is because of my believe in much higher Z tomorrow.

When do you need more space for your transaction?  
All addresses are with same length.   
So it depends if your btcs are spread on 10 addresses from which you take the funds to send to 1 or?   
   
The impression I am left with from your comment is that it doesn’t matter much if I send 0.1 btc, 1 or 100. Total fee will be about the same.   
  
I don’t completely understand how this multiadress thingy works but I do notice that not all my btc are on same address and if I send they come from 5-6 different ones. Which are all controlled with the same private key / seed?   
Can I have i finite addresses under same seed?  
  
Anyway, back to fees - so how can I calculate how much am I going to pay total, let’s say if I am paying 21 satoshi per byte - so... how much total saroshis is this for the transaction?

However regardless how small the amount is, I don't want her to get her money stolen - they will completely destroy any confidence in BTC.

Why are you paying those high fees?  
I am not doing that. I am refusing to pay those fees.  
Until Lightning network comes I am not moving my BTC from my hardware wallet and not moving my newly bought Bitcoin from the exchange.  
Once the fees and on chain transactions are lower - then I will start moving.  
Don't be silly and pay the current fees. There's just too much competition because of new people influx, no proper use of the transactions space optimisation - Segwit and people not setting fees manually, while relying on their software to decide the fee for them.

If people are not selling their coins the price can not go down, can it?  
Demand has to go lower than supply for the price to go down.  
If someone's playing the market and has the capital to make the volatile BTC even more volatile it will be all irrelevant in the long term.  
I expect BTC to be 30k in 6 months or less. Do you agree on that prediction or you expect it to be $5k or less?  
!RemindMe 6 months "BTC will be $30k or more, Futures drove the price up beyond expectations!"

We started this discussion from:  


  
That to me sounded like you are saying that if you have bitcoin - sell now, don't buy now if you don't have any as it wont ho any higher.  
However now you say that whales wont allow the price to go down.  
These two sentances are in conflict.  
What is it at the end - is Bitcoin the future and going to go up in price or is the end near?

Kraken charges me 0.001 bitcoin for withdrawal.  
Flat fee.  
Even if I have 0.01 bitcoin to withdraw, they still cahrge 0.001  
So this would be 10%.  
When an Exchange shows up that charges me much less - I am switching to it.  
Also I am talking about EU, so Coinbase / GDax is not an option.

What do you not agree on from what I've said?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:14:31
Yeah but check the mempool.   
There are thousands of transactions at 200 per, at circa 500 per and so on.   
If I am really rich and I want to make the transactions situation worse I will spam transactions at the current highest fees - 10% until none of my transactions goes through as people who need their transactions start overpaying.   
My old transactions will get stuck and never go through and eventually get returned back to me with new paid fee.
Then I start a new spam with new higher fees until I push them up again and people start overpaying even more.   
In order for this to get fixed everyone needs to stop transacting for a few days so all transactions get through and the spammers loose money.

The price of BTC can NOT go DOWN from Futures before it goes UP.  
They can not force the price of BTC to go down if they don't have any to SELL.  
Therefore I expect a BIG JUMP and after that volatility we haven't seen before.  
  
So either HODL and just wait until end of 2018 when your BTC is $100k-500k or Sell half after each big JUMP so you REBUY when it goes DOWN right after.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:16:12

It’s just wallet to exchange and exchange to wallet transactions (or local bitcoins).

Dude! Thanks a bunch! I've absorbed the knowledge ;)  
  


key2 = f(key1)  
key3 = f(key2)  
etc  
  
I didn't know that but it completely makes sense.  
  
I thought that sweeping is like moving an address from one wallet to another wallet - like you just take ownership of it instead of the old wallet.  
Didn't know it's transferrign the funds.  
Ok, in the app I used - Coinomi, all it asked me to sweep my old wallet was my private key. How does it know my public key?  
Is the private key enough so you can generate the public key out of it?  
  
Now that I've swiped the old address maybe I shouldn't use that wallet/address anymore, so in case Coinomi is milicious they can not steal my funds sometime in the future?  
  


  
Please do, give me some juicy details :)  
  


  
^ Also this. Why is that? I've seen in PHP there's this true_rand or something function that is supposed to be more random than just the rand(), which doesn't make sense to me - why isn't rand random in the first place and if there's a better random algorithm why didn't it just replace the old function's functionality?

And why it's 0 blocks only until 180, when there's just a few transactions at &gt;180, literally almost empty.

Thanks for all the answers :)  
It's still very unclear to me, but in the future with some more random knowledge from here and there and some more reaing I will get it.  
Like... how can 12 words generate multiple keys - I thought that's the whole point, that these 12 words, and only these!, and only in this paraticular order!, generate ony these private + public key pair.  
Now you say "check the first few since they are used in sequence."  first few? So it creates 20? Used in sequence? What sequence?  
Anyway, will get to the bottom of it eventually :)

On Electrum I send a transaction yesterday with 11 sat/b.  
It's about 18 hours later and the transaction still haven't gotten through.  
I get that I've put a low fee, so I might wait awhile or the transaction might evne drop out and the funds to get back to me.  
However I have these two transactions now that I made - as the first one was with 0.00000001 btc - just to make sure that I got the right address, and then a second one.  
Now the first one says Low Fee while the second one says Unconfirmed Parent.  
So... can I make a transaction now? Another one I mean.  
As if I have one with unconfirmed parent will every next one be like that as well so until the first one goes through or gets back to me I can not make new ones?  
  
Also what is that dinamic fees thingy, would I've been able to amend on the go my fee from 11 sat to something like 60 to speed it up if checked the checkbox?

I don't mind volatility. It's irrelevant for the HODLers and I am no trader.  
Important part for me is if in 2 months I will be able to sell my BTC at the same price or better if I wait for the right moment and not sell during a temporary, short, dip.  
And I expect higher than ever price with Future and not a big, long and tedious dip.

I am not sure if you are sarcastic or for real, so just in case you are not joking: you can not voluntarily mine with your dual core the 0 fee transactions.  
Only one block per 10 minutes gets created and it includes the highest fee transaction, that's it.  
You can not put extra effort and add more transactions, the 0 fee ones for instance, it doesn't work like that.

I don't get the process.  
Firstly - I didn't know that the 12 words seed gives infinite amount of addresses, I thought they are like 10-15 or so.  
Secondly I don't get how the sweeping works.  
I thought that it just lets' you import private/public key pair - which is all you need in order to access the funds at address X.  
So I didn't think that sweeping an address does anything to neither seeds. The old kne you had is just the same with the same addresses as well as the new one you created and sweeped the additional address on. I don't even exactly know what the word sweep means in this situation. Anyway, so can you realy on demand create a new seed that gives you the old addresses + the new one you've sweeped? I don't think that this is how it works, as the addresses you get from the 12 words are completely random, you can not generate 12 words by 12 addresses for instance.

So I think it's a smart, even though risky, investment.  
Again - I don't need Bitcoin for my day to day purchases. But that's just me I guess, everyone else who complains about fees TODAY are people who REALLY need to buy that coffee with Bitcoin today.

I absolutely agree with this.  
However let's not be short sighted.  
What happens next after the mass sell off from the people with weak hands? The price dips to low unseen since when? 12 months ago?  As just 12 short months ago the price was 700 US dollars.  
And then what happens? It stays there? Forever? Really? Is this what you think would happen?  
I think that if big player sells 500k bitcoins the price indeed will dip do $1000, however than it will quickly recover back to the current ~20k.

If you mean you can "fake" a $500 Shitcoin - this will work only if other people start buying it, not when you are buying and selling back to yourself.  
And if people are dump and easy to lie to and make them believe a shitcoin's value is X - it's their money, they are free to do whatever they want with them.

At the same time I've read this theory that someone with 1bln can buy btc for 500mln and at the same time put CFD for going up with 10x leverage for oging up - and he double caches in.  
Then he sells for 500mln and shorts at x10 leverege and again caches out doble. I am afraid of it and this makes sense to me.

There's nothing bad in changing your opinion, as long as you don't do it eery 10 mintues. If you do - maybe admit that apparently you just don't know enough on the subject, wait it out, gather more information and then only if you truly believe you have some proper valid opinion on the subject - lay it down.

Will I put more money if it continues to go lower? Not sure.  
I don't have much money left to invest so I can not buy much more.  
The thing is it matters how quick it goes down I guess and if it recovers quickly or not.  
The current dips don't seem to me like the doom of Bitcoin.  
Just holidays and banks not working.  
People don't have much mone yelft after the holidays to invest, it just makes sense to me.  
The tech is there, the word is there, I think at 2018 we will be at &gt;$20k.  
Will see I guess.

What the fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:08:52
Can you please go in more details how does the two work?  
I mean sweeping - it makes a transaction from the old address to one in the current wallet's addresses, ok I get that, but doesn't it need my private key in order to make the transaction?   
Also how does the important works?  
As explained above:  


key2 = f(key1)  
key3 = f(key2)  
etc  
  
So if my old address mey seed goes through f(seed) and gets me key1, then the new wallet will have:  
new_wallet_address_key_1 = f(seed_of_new_address)  
And then new_wallet_address_key_2 = f(new_wallet_address_key_1)  
But then you can not just somehow force it into using the old addressses.  
So is it just going to start managing both of the wallets?  
  


  
This ^ doesn't make sense to me. Aren't the 12 words seed equal to everything?  
As they generate the private/public key for the 1st address and from there on you get access every next one as well.  
  


  
back to my question - how does importing works, as you can not just add this address to the wallet, as the function explained above doesn't work like that.  
Maybe the app just starts using two seeds so it can manage both.  
  
Also, correct me if I am wrong, but if you give private/public pair for address_3 to someone, he now has access to all your addresses from  to infinity, no?  
You have now secure only address  and  as they can not be generated from   
  
Also does it loop? I mean, if seed of 12 words generates address_1 and then I do f(address_1) if I continue this to address_1249081249214812 - isn't there a chance that that one will generate address address_1 and then it will start looping?  
What are these numbers that the 12 words represent? Prime numbers? Why are they important again?

That's why they wont be doing ON CHAIN transactions, but through Coinbase - as a bank.  
So you deposit 1 Bitcoin on Coinbase / or buy it with USD / and then you spend it on Amazon over time without paying a penny for fees.

So when is it going to burst? When it's HALF A FUCKING MILLION DOLLARS?  
Burst to what? To 0? To 200k?  
Why would it take it SO LONG to burst?  
It's already going strong for 10 years, why does it need another 3 for people to finally realise it has no value, it's thin air?  
Why don't you get it that Bitcoin is the most secure database in the world. In the fucking world mate.  
If how much money has this guy and that guy is one of the most important things to secure I don't know what is and why you don't think money need to be secure.  
Or if you think that BITCOIN IS NOT THE MOST SECURE DATABASE IN THE WORLD it just means that you are a pleb without any  technical understanding of how Bitcoin work and how it can not be hacked.

Or keep some of your BTC on an exchange.

Yeah, yeah, futures will be swinging the price A LOT.  
However I expect it to be more volatile than anything we've seen so far, so I do not intend to trade, unless there's like 150%+ up swing in 1 day, I would sell as I would expect a 150%, or so, swing down.  
What is it now in Euros? 13k? Sure, 9k is absolutely possible.  
However I expect by the time CME is on board the price to be at 20k+, so 9k would have to stretch a big swing - like the ones of 150% I mentioned.  
But I think the daily ones would be +/- 30-50% in each direction, rarely more.

Bitcoin will either go to a million dollars or go to 0. No middle ground.
If it goes to 0 - it was hacked, quantum PCs, people diteched it, whatever.
If people keep building the infrastructure, keep buying, keep the addoption going it will go up and up in price just because of it's limited supply and bigger demand duo to more people involved.
I am betting that people wont ditch it and it wont be hacked. One of the best engineers are working on this project and a lot of really rich entrepreneurs are building business on top of it.

Every single day FIAT money devaluates. More and more is being printed at a faster phase than ever before.  
Bitcoin goes up in value because of all the infrastructure that is build around it that is being improved every single day. More and more adoption, businesses around it.  
It’s dangerous not to have ANY Btc because if inflation worldwide starts hitting Turkey’s value whoever holds Bitcoin will be in a good spot and a lot other people jot so much.

8 years ago. When Bitcoin was 100 times more risky investment than today. Saying you bought 8 years ago to me doesn’t mean you were smart 8 years ago. You would be smarter if you are buying now. Yes, obviously, in hindsight it’s better if you bought 8 years ago, but now it’s much more of a calculated risk and speculation on something that is actually wild known, has tons of infrastructure build around it and has some fundamentals to base price predictions on.

It is beyond me how people don't get it.  
If something's worth $10 per and you buy $100 worth, you get 10 of those thigns, right?  
If the price goes up 10 times all of a sudden you have 10 things that are worth $100 each, so you got $1000, all sounds good so far?  
  
Here's the second scenario:  
You "missed the train" and bought only one $100 thing, as you have just $100.  
The price however went up 10 times and now it's worth $1000.  
You turned your $100 into $1000, no? What's the difference then?  
  
Ohhh... now I get it... you can not even buy a whole Bitcoin with $100, yeah? Now I get it... yeah... makes sense.. Anyway, stupid me, let's do the math.  
Bitcoin is worth $7k today.  
With $100 you are going to buy 0.014 bitcoins.  
Fucking hell, that's like nothing! Zero point ZERO fourteen? Fuck me, that's not worth it, you pay $100 for that shit!!!  
Anyway, let's finish the math: so if Bitcoin goes up 10 times you will still have 0.014 Bitcoin, but the price per will be $70k, therefore your 0.014 Bitcoin will be worth... hmmm... how much?... FUCKING A THOUSAND DOLLARS, MAN, NOW DO YOU GET IT?  
It's irrelevant at what price you are buying Bitcoin if it's going to go up.  
Question is... do you think Bitcoin is NOT going to go up anymore?  
If you think so ... yeah... you are right... [Don't buy Bitcoin, 'cus you know it's gonna crash again.](

Correct.  
Think about it.  
How many trillions of dollars was there?  
Now imaging if another currency replaces that and it's limited at 21 million, how much each one of these new ones will be worth in the value of the old one?  
  
Chances of FIAT / cash to completely dissapear in enxt 5 years is 0.  
However I believe Bitcoin is not done growing, not at all.  
And IF it stays limited to 21 million it's value in today's money will be 1 billion.  
^ that is math, not what I am sure will happen or what I bet with all my savings will happen.  
It's just what will happen IF Bitcoin becomes widely spread and is successfull.  
Lightning network nad Layer 3 will make that possible or something in between will happen to stop it's progress. A much better coin maybe? Developers might stop working on Bitcoin and move to something else? A lot of possibilities for stuff to go south. 
I hope they don't.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:01:17
A lot of people advice for people not to share how much they have.  
Not just because of how much it's worth now, but also because of the fact that in the future, IF Bitcoin succeeds and goes to 1mln+, everyone who has now 10k, all of a sudden would have 1mln in Bitcoin.  
And hackers, truly knowledgeable ones, not fake ones, will start digging into this subreddit, and elsewhere, looking for accounts who claimed to have X and Y.  
Once they have targets, nicknames, they can start getting real names, emails, other website accounts. Sooner or later one account gets compromised, than another and sooner or later they might get onto your exchange account.  
I do believe that no one should be sharing how much he has.  
  
That being said - I am not going to say if I have even half a Bitcoin, 1, 10 or 100.  
It's all irrelevant.  
Important part for me is that I Believe in this tech, I believe it has a bright future and mass addoption is coming, I believe really rich people winn invest into Bitcon in 2018 which will Skyrocket the price and regardless of how much is the number, it's worth about 30% of my savings. I have put that much because I believe in it enough to put that many eggs in one basket. That's the important part. This should be the question.  
Not how many Bitcoins you have or how much money you put in, but what % of the available to you money / savings.

Once Bitcoin has proper 2nd layer where you can transfer microtransaction with almost no fees then the adoption will explode.

As many people said there's too much responsibility in bitcoin. If you fuck up an address, you loose money. If you lose your keys - you loose your money.  
I don't mean for Bitcoin to replace FIAT completely, but to give the world a better alternative, that will be a complementary one.  
When I say replace I don't mean to buy coffee with it.  
I mean to have a resource, limited one, just like gold, however that is digital.  
Like... actually - this is what paper money were supposed to be - they had their value in gold. Not anymore...  
Well, bitcoin doesn't need that in order to be proper store of value.

In a month time, if the price hits a new ATH, after the fork I will buy during the correction. If there is a 30% dip after the form I will buy as well. But for lees than I already put in.   
Pretty much my plan is that I put more money in only  if the price drops 30% and if I withdraw all I would get at least what I put in.  
So if I’ve put in 1k dollars when the price was 1k and then the price is 2k, I can put in extra $500 as then if the price drops 30% I can get 70% of 2.5k which is more than the 1.5k I put in. Makes sense?   
But I can not just put in everything I want to put in as I am afraid of losses. Even though I really don’t see BTC dropping under $5k ever again
p.s My first purchase was of 10% of my current total, then I did another 10%, then put 40 and a week or two later another 40% of my total 100% investment. What I am saying is that I didn’t go on one go but slowly. Over a month. Haven’t put more in for more than a month now.

She was a beast.
Issue is I feel some of the things she said - you need to know them in order to understand what she means.
Like the question for the scaling and she mentioned segwit, schnorr, LN - if you don’t know what these are.. you wont get it what has changed.
I personally heard something like blockstream liquid? No idea what’s that and should I be excited.

And if the price goes to a million (in 5 years) he will get 1000 profit. Much better than a bank would give him for his $100.    
I think it’s better to put in $100 today, another $200 in 3 months and then another $500 in 6 months then not put any money OR put a lot, more than you feel comfortable losing and then panic sell during the coming dip.

^ This makes as much sense as:  
If I go to work today I will make $100.  
Bil Gates makes $100 000 today without even going to work.  
Conclusion: It's not worth it going to work.  
  
Why are you looking into what other people have and comparing it with what you have?  
If you buy today you will have $1000 when the price goes up 10 times and then the people who could buy if they follow your advice they will miss another train.  
What about the earlier-than-the-early-adopters? They already had the $1000 when the early adopters had to put their $100 in to make the $1000, while the early-early ones would've made $10 000. Following your advice the early adopters should've not done it. And today they wouldn't had the $100k   
  
tl;dr your arguemnt is as invalid as it can be.

I didn’t do the math, as I was too lazy, and knew I would be off, but it should still show my point, however your math is off?   
1mln / 7k is 141 and that multiplied by $200 is 28.571 - so $28.471 profit. No?

One thing is predictable and 100% guaranteed.
Block reward will be halved.
Instead of 12.5 per block, 6.25 bitcoin will be mined.
Price of btc? How much it will cost to mine 1 new btc? No one knows.
IF the price stays the same it will turn unprofitable for miners to mine. So a lot of then will close down their doors. Hash rate will drop. It’s a self correcting system.
BTC can never be too profitable to mine. For instance if price to mine 1 btc is $5k and price of btc is $10k more miners will jump in to get that 100% investment return.
The moment they do in up to 2 weeks the hash rate correct itself and hash power required to mine 1 btc goes up and that’s the end of the “free money”.
I hope I made it clear that: Even though we EXPECT price of btc to go up after halving it is NOT guaranteed.
BTC is a supply to demand ratio price wise.
If demand stays the same price will indeed go up.
If it goes lower price will stay same after the halving unless demand drops more. Simple as that.
Mining is 100% correlated with the price. The higher the price of btc the more miners will join the higher the hashrate will get the harder it will be to mine, eating away profits of miners.

Even if something goes up in price, constantly, I would still sell it out if I have no other free money.  
I see it as savings account.

I would do that only if I need money in emergency or big ticket stuff - house, new car, wedding, hospital bill. Here and there if I feel weak - Oculus.

I really think he’s a very smart guy.
Watched his “I am the top 1% come speak with me” Wallstreet stunt - was actually quite good (link  )
He’a visit at Joe Rogan’s podcast is actually one of the beat podcasts I’ve watched: 
Him talking about minimum wage and whom it serves, how he predicted the 2008 crash and how we are still in the same bubble that got the 2008 crash, now just even more inflated, how the US economy is NOT profitable, how the dollar’s collapse will follow the negative interest rates, insane printing of money (this already happened) and then the government bonds being sold out by oversees investors.
He either... like a lot of smart people has a blind spot or he is just still accumulating and doesnt want the price to go up.
I just recently saw Joe Rogan’s blind spot on the Simulation theory - this guy was explaining it like to a 5 years old and Joe Rogan continued to say “But this table DOES feel real! Why arent you sure it IS real?!”
It made me humble and leas judgemental.
I’ve watched a lot of Joe Rogan podcasts, I think as he’ve spoken to so many smart people he got smarter and smarter, but Got Damn if I was judging him based on that podcast episode... Holy shit what a tool.

I think YOU are full of shit, but that aside, I think market will stabilise because of the hard work being put on the technology.  
Check the LN stats increasing every day.  
If you think BTC is not worth $4k or $20k, how much is it worth then? Why?  
It’s sound money that a lot of people appreciate for what it is.  
The 20k will be dwarfed in the future. I am confident and this is why I am not in panic mode as a lot of people who’ve put too much in.  
Just today I deposited X on kraken and bought with 35% of the deposit.
Will buy more in the next few days.  
Already placed buy orders at lower prices.  
I see the use of this tech and I want to use it.  
I am not a good enough developer to contribute, but I do have money to vote with. Bitcoin to me has higher value than $4 k and I see it going much higher than it is now.  
  
If you think last December was the peak, ever, for Bitcoin - people thought the same when it first hit $100 and $1000.  
  
This dip is caused by whales. Not the natural market sentiment.

Got no kids, not married, no mortgage, no sick old parents to take care of, not even a pet.  
Let's say I've put x3 of my salary in BTC.  
If I loose it all because tomorrow BTC goes to 0 - will I be sorry? Hell yeah I will! x3 salaries I can go party all night all day for like a month, or go on a budget vacation for 2-3 months.  
However.... if I've put x3 salaries 1, 2, 3 or 5 years ago I would be really, really happy that I did so now.  
That's my thinking.  
Worse case scenarios - I loose x3 salaries. Best case scenario - it repeats what happened past 5 years and I am extremely happy in a year or two.  
  
Afford to lose. That's an interesting term. I think I can afford to loose all my posessions, all my money in the bank, etc. All I need is money for x1 month of rent until next salary - I got a secure job.  
So this question "Have you invested more than you can afford to loose" is a little bit odd to me.  
Unless someone actually has taken a loan from the bank, that is equal to x10 of his salaries or more, I don't see how someone can put into BTC more than one can afford to loose.

Reminder: different countries, different banking systems.  
In my country there was no online banking until 5 years ago or so.  
No contactless cards until 2 years ago.  
  
How you forget about debt you have?  
I had a bank account that I had to close 3 times.  
How can I close an account 3 times?  
3 times the paper got lost. As from the twon I am from it has to travel to the Capital and someone doesn't do his job correctly and the paper work gets lost.  
So I had about $30 in the bank account and I said I want to close it.  
So I withdraw all the funds and pay the $5 or so closing fee.  
Then a few months later they tell me that I owe them $X.  
I ask why? They say because you have a bank account with us that has no funds in it, but has monthly fee.  
I am like I closed that account, they tell me I didn't.  
I pay off what they tell me I owe and I this time I want them to give me a copy of all the paper work that I am submitting a "request" to close my bank account.  
They give me the copy.  
A year later I receive a call that I owe money. Again.  
This time I had the copy of the paper work.  
After 2 more months I've been asked to go down to the bank again to sign some paper work so they can finally close it for me.  
So, yeah... not everyone has first world banking.  
  
Oh, also reminds me of how when I openned the same bank account I had to wait for 4 months to get my debit card because I lived at a different town than where my ID card is.  
So by default they send the debit card to the main branch of the twon you are from.  
I told them that's inconvinient for me, please get it here.  
They said they will.  
After waiting a month and the card not arriving I called them asking where it is. They said in my home town.  
I explained that I wanted it here. They were oh ok, we will send it than. Kk, thanks, talk to you later.  
Fast forward 2 weeks later - same situation, card never left my home town.  
At the end I gave up and I said I will go pick it up from my home town when I get there.  
I get there close to 4 months after I initially got my account with them. The card was at the other town now. Told them not to do anything and after my vacation eneded I got my card.....

If you spend today $1000 for a new phone and if you've spend today 0.1 BTC to buy that same new phone - where's the difference? I see none.  
If you want more crypto you will turn that $1k in crypto today.  
If you want a new phone you will either buy new phone with the $1k you have lying around or you will buy it with the crypto.  
Literally no difference.  
  
Also the same way you think about Bitcoin, that it's not worth spending as you hope it's gonna go only up, because of limited supply, you can say the same thing about any other good investment.  
Let's say Google or Facebook stock. I don't think either of those companies is gonna die out any time soon so I wouldn't sell any shares. Unless... I need the cash ;) Same with crypto.

More useful - no.  
Inherent value - scarcity/store of value, censorship free, decentralised.  
Scarcity / Store of value - I know that if Bitcoin is $1 now it will be $3 in 10 years because of inflation - as the $3 in 10 years have the same purchasing power as $1 today.  
Censorship free - only I can move my funds. I don't need the permission of anyone to send ALL my coins to anyone. I wont receive a call from the bank asking me where does this money come from, etc.  
Decentralised - a bank can be hacked. You can purchase for $10 or less a list of 5k credid cards, with their owner's names, cc number and security number, etc. Bitcoin has never been hacked so far. Doubt it it will anytime soon.

What would be the benefits of that?  
We talked about the downside, but I don't see any benefits of this.  
Except that you can in some way fitler out the data - so the app receives from your hosted back-end different/modified data than the one the exchange gives. Let's say  you remove a few things because they are not needed, or maybe you add a few more that you've calculated.  
But the trade off to do that on some back-end serve rinstead of just in the front-end is not worth it.

You mean like additional money, not the ones that go towards pension.  
Ok.  


  
They are, but they can't :D  
Check the cost of living of [Varna, Bulgaria compared to Manchester, UK](  
  
The salaries are 78% lower, while plenty of things are just 1-5% cheaper (instead of 78%), a bunch are 60% cheaper and some are even more expensive.  
What this means is that if you want to have the same lifestyle you will be able to save smaller % of your salary, and regardless of the % that you will be saving, still the salary is 3 times smaller, whcih completely kills any savings you would make anyway.  
Like, even if you save 50% (which is unreasonable %, having in mind just rent is 200 euros, then you have another 100 for bills), that's 50% of 400 euros.

But... that's what the extra fee at the end is for - for all those expenses. The owning party pays for these anyways. IF you owe $1k you pay $1k 50 for it or something.

Everything that happened is absolute natural and fair.  
I only disagree with freezing 100% of her funds (in all bank accounts across all banks) because she owes a fraction  of what she has to someone else.   
Imagine having $100k in your bank account and it gets frozen because you owe $1k.  
Is this fair?  
Now imagine that you owe $1k and you got your $1mln frozen. 
Still fair?  
Where's the line?  
IMO the amount frozen should be equal to the owed one. Not more.

Hi there,
I've started visiting this subreddit about a month and a half and shortly after bought my first fractions of a bitcoin.  
Discovered about a week later.  
I instantly noticed the big difference.  
Firstly - they are all about bitcoin cash, not bitcoin.  
They claim that they got the stuff right - in terms of how to scale it, that fees are much lower, it's faster, core devs are the evil guys, etc.  
I was really wondering who's right and who's wrong and it was important for me to get the bottom of it.  
  
Let me state that I am definitelly a supporter and now. I've made my mind.  
A few of the thinks that made my mind were:  
On btc they place a lot of ads, some with titles "if you are not on you are getting only half of the story". I get that ads could be important, I was just surprised that the thing doesn't sell o nitself but needs money spend to attract people.  
Then I started getting more about the debate about increasing the block size. Another user here said it best:  


  
The whole idea of bitcoin is to be decentralized. What they are doing with bcash is to make it harder for the regular Joe to participate in the network.  
Bcash was forked because of a few groups of Miners. As many people mentioned here already - these miners had ASCIBOOST, which is unfair advantage over whoever doens't have them, which again centralizes the network and excludes users who want in. This is not what bitcoin is supposed to be, or what I want it to be.  
  
So to me it's not about what has higher price, who's price goes up faster, or whatever. What is the better tech, what has more future - to be truely cut off banks and international money with no limits where everyone is equal. This is what I want and this is what I believe is Bitcoin, but not Bcash.

Thing is, as hard as it is to determine the top, when is the best time to sell, it's equally hard to determine where is the bottom.  
Tomorrow BTC might  plummet to 5k. Might go to 2k in a week.  
Also might go back to 10k+.  
You can not tell. There are no signs.

It's interesting to see how people thing that getting with unpaid debt that you didn't think about is so uncommon.  
Or that it shows a lot about character of the person.  
There's plenty of good people with large debt. A lot of them, with their families, get bankrupt and thrown on the streets for unpaid mortgage. This doesn't make them bad people.

Fun fact is that during the Bitcoin dip to 6k Stock market also went down with record numbers. Something to think about.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:14:29
Which sounds insane, right?  
Now think how insane it sounded 5 years ago that Bitcoin will be $5k in 5 years.  
No. Fucking. Way. This is what people thought.  
You buy bitcoins for $1k and then you are a millionare in 5 years. Who would've believed that.  
Well, thing is that Bitcoin has much more prepared for it now - more stores accept it, development went a long way, many people know about it and many more people have some, many more people are waiting for that dip now, so they can buy in - all of this adds up. Potential of Bitcoin to go higher in the next 6 months is much heigher than it was to go up in 6 months 5 years ago. No? If you agree with me what's the difference with next 5 years forecast?

1. Register at Kraken.com  
2. Verify your account at the 2nd level so you can deposit up to $2k.  
3. Deposit and buy Bitcoins.  
4. Google Electrum wallet, download the app, install it, next next, create a wallet, record somewhere the 12 words seed.  
5. Transfer small portion (0.01) Bitcoins to your Electrum wallet to make sure you got the address right. If you did ‘t you will lose just the 0.01, not all you got.  
6. Transfer all from Kraken to the Electrum wallet.

@_date: 2017-10-26 10:06:39
This doesn’t make ANY sense.  
What MORE bitcoins in the market? This is not Fiat money, you can not make them from thin air.  
If someone buys stuff directly with bitcoin or he sells them for fiat and then buys the product - it’s the same thing. Bitcoin in circulation doesn’t change.  
If amazon starts accepting Bitcoin tomorrow I would not spend my bitcoins. Not at all. As I know this only means that the price is going to even higher as more retailers will follow Amazon and because of that adoption will sky rocket and with it price (more people will want to buy in, not every one needs fiat today so not many will be selling). So I would buy that mouse for $50 instead of 0.01 bitcoin, thank you very much.   
   
TL:DR The more retailers accept bitcoin, the higher the price will be. Amazon accepting it will skyrocket the price.

Thing is, I have money. I mean, I am by no means rich, but I have more than what I've put into bitcoin about 1 month ago. But I am just not too sure in it.  
I see it's potential, I really hope it goes big and sure, I care about getting some nice returns, but I am actually excited about this technology replacing fiat in the future!  
However, I am not knowledgeable enough to be sure enough in bitcoin in order to invest more. I've invested 10% of my savings. I think if I've invested more and it crashes/dies I will be mad at myself. At the same time I think if I invested less and it goes big I will regret it.  
My current "criteria" to invest some more is to hit 5.5k or not go downhill in the next 2 months. If either happens I will put more.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:52:26

Me, as a specialist in one thing, can not win the clients that pay the big bucks. I am part of a really big machine and can not do anything without everyone else. I don’t mind the guy who started 30years ago, took all the risks and the stress getting more than what he pays me. Why should I? Everyone gets what he deserves. I have the capital to start my own business. Do I want to? Not really. Too much work, too little sleep, no time for friends or family. Important part for me is not to need to lick someone’s ass in order to feel “secure”.  
I feel secure because of the countless job offers that I cover the requirements for, at the same daily rate I am being paid now. If I ever get a job I feel like I don’t deserve or they pay me too much, the. again I wont stress out, as I would just be with the mindset that this is temporary, cash in as much as I can and then get a nice vacation.

Hey dude,  
I've downloaded Electrum, made a wallet and send myself the coins from my choice of exchange - Kraken.  
K, so now I have the coins there.  
I tried to send them to somewhere else - just to make sure I can take them out, it worked.  
However... it asked me for my password when I did. Never for my private key.  
And a private key is supposed to be 32 letters and numbers, no?  
I even recreated my wallet with the 12 words seed, again no private key was shown to me.  
Is this how it's supposed to work?  
Just remember the temporary password I have atm and the permanent 12 words seed?

What I think is extremely unfair is that we have to pay taxes on investments.  
So let’s say Bitcoin is risky, volatile and might completely die in next 12 months.  
So even though I know that —&gt; I &lt;— take the risk and put my 10k savings in it. Turns out a good investment and a year later I can cash out at 20k. Now I own the government half of the profit? What? Why? I took the risk! It paid out! I earned this fair and square.  What if the price dropped to $1, would the government give me back half of what I lost?? No?? Why do they deserve half of what I took a risk for the , it doesn’t make any sense to me.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:39:55
The part that is different here is that the media coverage goes exponentially.  
So actually what happens is new ATH of 5k, dip to 3’.2k, back to 5k, new ATH of 5.8k, dip to 5.2k, new ATH of 6k.  
ATHs and dips are more dense and if you ask me this train has no breaks and will not have breaks for some time, forks, attacks, all is irrelevant when you zoom out. Next 12 months I expect x5-10 returns.

1btc is indeed a big deal. Doesn’t seem like that today? Let’s talk again in 10 years.

What do you expect the correction to be?  
Let's say we are at 5.8k at the time of the fork. What's next?

This is why I never buy at one position.  
Firstl - I already have some satoshis.  
So as I am working my way up to the full btc if I have $500 laying around I dont just buy NOW, I buy for $100.  
Then I put another b uy order, limit, with price $200 lower than it is now, and another 3 to follow with $200 lower than the previous.  
This way - if I buy with just 1/5th of my money I still make some profit and if it drops after my initial purchase I am happy it did as I am buying more with the same money! It's a WIN-WIN situation.

I love BTC and I bought some satoshis neither to store my value of my money, neither to purchase stuff with it on the internet.  
I believe the banking industry is the least innovative one and we need something like BTC to break that cartel and make progression sparkle again.  
I want censorless, borderless, decentralised currency. Sounds like the future of money to me. It just makes sense. I understand the downsides - no phone call to complain on, etc, but I love the tech. This is literally the first real internet money that can not be faked and is protected by massive miner’s hash power. I just love it. Bought some again last week, will buy again on next pay check.

I just understood from you how all that ^ works. Thanks for that.

I haven’t taken a look at the study/article, just saw the title and your comment.   
Thing is, a lot of studies are a pile of crap because of the settings in which the study is done - the result is the expected.  
However, I just agree with the title.   
Crypto brought a looot of stress to me when I was day trading alts, a lot of stress when it was going up and I was debating if I should sell to realise profits or if I do I will regret it ones Bitcoin gets to a million.  
And even more stress ones it went 20k&gt;6k.  
So now I am a hodler. I stopped looking at the price, stopped caring too much. I believe in the tech, I want this thing to succeed, so I am buying a little bit every pay check. Simple, stress free. But wasn’t always like this.

Almost same story. Waiting for another deposit of fiat to an exchange as we speak.  
  
I believe in the future of the tech, regardless of the current price.

My first thought was “OMG, it’s happening again, a Bitcoin Bull-run is coming, just like last time - right after a guy holding a sign “Buy Bitcoin” on TV.”
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:30:43
If / when it hits 19k again dont sell more than half.
Keep the other half for at 30k.
I am on the ted right. ow as well. Having in mind I HODL hard right now I don’t intend months later to sell just at break even. I want at least 50% profit.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:18:59
You win. It's closer to 5k.
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:54:22
Good job mate.  
Unless you are ... rich and $9k isn't a lot of money for you I wouldn't advice into buying all at ones.  
What I mean is, to me personally $9k is quite a lot of money. I understand it isn't to everyone.  
However let's say you have the number X you want to put into crypto - put it gradually, over the course of 2 to 4 weeks.  
If it goes up - it goes up with % of the money you thought to invest so you don't loose much. If it goes down during these 2-4 weeks if you feel good as you are now buying cheaper coins.  
So 1 coin, eh? Where's your second I ask?

I do tell my friends how much I earn so I try to stimulate them to study and be more career oriented. However I never disclose Crypto, as if I have 10k dollars in fiat right now in my bank account, 1 year from now I will have same 10k, maybe with interet 10.01k, however with crypto you never know if that 10k wont turn into 100k-500k.

As safe as your pain tolerance.  
All you need is a $5 scredriver between your nails to give away your pin to the Nano S.  
I don't tell ANYONE how much crypto I have. I do tell them that I do have some so they can feel free to ask me questions about it and I can to the best of my knowledge point them in the right direction, however I never disclose how much I have.
