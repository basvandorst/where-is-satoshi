I couldn't get verified by Circle. When I tried to link my bank account, they requested more information. I preferred Coinbase's simple verification instead.

Also the first to gain the infamous "green dick" with bitcoin XD

Just saying, if you consider Doge to be "fake internet points", I don't think it's a big stretch to consider Bitcoin to be "fake internet points". Important global communities already think of BTC in this manner because of the likes of you :)

Is Circle instant? I.e if I buy some BTC with USD, how long will it take to receive it?

If various financial institutions around the world, including those in China, do not fit in your definition of "important global communities", then you must believe you have a great amount of support :)

You can also get a (fairly) cheap DigitalOcean VPS. For $5 a month, you can set up a pretty decent node. You'd have to install swap and whatnot (unless you limit connections), but it's not bad.

Why so mean? :/

I didn't say China likes Doge. At this rate, China doesn't like much because of disconcert among cryptocurrencies, due to users like you :). Good job!

I didn't run the bitcoin daemon, but I ran dogecoind on my VPS. I had to install swap because it crashed every ~75k blocks. Once it fully synced, however, I limited the max_connections to 8, which fixed the crashing issue. I ended up upgrading the VPS to 1 GB of RAM because it was more stable that way.

We shibes often are :)

Just curious, what makes you think anyone from the Dogecoin community did this? If he has a BTC wallet, odds are he could have been from either community, or a member of both.
So please don't point fingers at any specific community. We're all cryptocurrency users, whether you prefer BTC or any altcoin. Bashing each other will never help any cryptocurrency become widely accepted.

Your drawing skill seriously degraded on the right side (even though it was awful to begin with).
