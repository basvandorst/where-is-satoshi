Guys, it's not over yet. I expect the Lunar eclipse in February but now we will probably go sideways.

I've been analysing my trading fees. Fucking exchanges are even more greedy than bankers. We seriously need some decentralization in this area.

Let me explain to you simple minded people. If you are a Wall Street guy you probably already have some bitcoin so do your friends. So when the whole world is expecting price growth you and your friends sell like crazy. The price goes down you buy back in and make twice the profit. Got it.

Not a conspiracy theory here but I think the Wall street bastards like to buy cheap.

Maybe we have to go back to 8k before going to the moon.
