Hey buddy. I’m pretty sure your comment is being made fun of on a front page post on r/wsb. You got chewed out by reddit lmfao. Get lost.

I wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin became worthless in the future. The way bitcoin works reminds me of the 2008 housing crisis and how the housing market went to shit because homes didn't actually have any value since no one was living in them.

WHY THE FUCK DID YOU BET ALL YOUR LIFE SAVINGS WITHOUT SETTING UP A STOP LOSS FOR THE UNDERLYING STOCK PRICE?  And why in fucking hell would you ever bet your life savings on AMD let alone anything in tech? Like could you have picked any worse of a ticker to bet on? AMD? Are you autistic?  They make shit tier hardware for shit tier products. At least choose something like Apple if you have dementia and you decide to bet your life savings you fucking neanderthal.

Throw in some more buzzwords while you're at it. And lay off the alcohol you are already too dumb because of the trisomy 21.

Buddy. You don’t understand bitcoin as well as you would like to think. Not nearly as well. Hell even people on Wall Street don’t understand stock market as well as they would like to think. So why should I believe a puny rat like you on reddit? 
I’ll say it again. People like you who get suckered into this idea of bitcoin are schmucks. Hell even all the people buying and selling options are schmucks too. Just look at r/wallstreet bets as an example. Buying options to protect your underlying shares as insurance is also stupid because that implies that your stock that you bought is iffy. Also friendly reminder that you compete with hedge funds and if you knew anything about them you would know that they will squash you like the insufferable autistic programmer cockroach that you are.

Options are more predictable than bitcoin. Something tells me you have a tenuous grasp on bitcoin and more so for options.

You are delusional. You should focus your effort in getting good grades. Listen to your mommy and daddy. ��

I don’t need to learn about it. Because there is no need to. Bitcoin is beyond retarded and its actual use is even less important than trading it. But I do wish you good luck. That you make some money so you don’t starve for the rest of your life. Shmuck.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:25:16
Yah. I’ll stick to a normal bank. And if I wanted to potentially make real money, I’ll just play poker, or trade options. A lot better than buying digital currency where its only value comes from other buyers.

Lol blowhard let’s see pictures of your big house. If you don’t, then I’m going to assume you are just lying.

Bitcoin is literally the most autistic commodity. Bitcoin has nothing to do with investing and its behavior is erratic, irrational and fraught with risk. This subreddit is full of redditards thinking bitcoin is something to behold.

Alright. Hit me up when you can afford a brand new civic.
