Even though MtGox is a private company I'd like to see how their fees are spent just to make sure losermcfail is right.

The idea is to let Mt Gox accounts deposit into a shared savings account and earn interest.  At the same time, the coins are available for short sale only to other people by paying a borrow fee.  BTC may be going higher in the long term, but people may want to profit off short term liquidity crashes. People with long term investments may want to earn extra interest on their deposits.

Most countries run a monetary system based on a central bank issuing money.  Perhaps the use of "the Fed" biases this discussion toward the US but I believe the title of the post is generic.  What changes do you propose?
I believe governments will be pressured to tax miners' revenue. In most cases the classification of revenue into income, gains, or gambling earnings would affect the tax rate only.

I hope this is not the risk officer commenting. Coinbase does have USD risk and if they believe they don't they may discover this at the worst time. Also they are capable of making much more than 1% fee from trading by internalizing order flow, and again, if they are not they are giving up lots of money on the table.

Would anyone be interested in being an early user in a service to sell short bitcoins?
