i meant btcjam.com had no involvement in the trial, and i haven't looked up the details of the court case (which should be public info) to see why the damage reward is what it is, or to see what type of judgment it was.  Curious as I am, I just don't have the time to invest right now.

Yeah, and I think it's temporary... just a way to "accommodate" the legacy system as we move forward.  I can't see a need for these cards too far into the future.


Would be great to post a list of the URLs here... then maybe as I get some time I will post reviews as I create accounts.  
I made an account at XAPO, but I can't remember if they pay interest which was my primary motifaction.

I also buy bitcoin every paycheck... but I also use and HODL.  I shop almost every week on Amazon and buy with PURSE.io so I end up saving more money than I would at walmart (most times... sometimes it's a break even).  So this allows me to support the network as well as grow my HODLings.  Possible making sure HODLings are valuable someday.

Mainly because I didn't do my research LOL.  My brother was a HARD CORE conspiracy guy so I generally dismissed anything he brought up, but the main thing was that he explained it very poorly and incorrectly - He didn't understand it at all.  
So Bitcion was at a disadvantage from the get-go.   Then about two years later I saw it somewhere... read the white paper, read the code, started mining, started to study monetary science a little, study the FED RES, etc. etc. and then I was like "FUCK, I'm retarded!!!!" almost 6 months of studying before I jumped on board... even though during that 6 month time period I was like "Hey, shit man, this is going to be HUGE!!!!"

I actually started giving Bitcoin Talks at my local libraries and this was my first issue in writing my talks.  I had to create a talk that was simple enough that anyone (especially non-technical people) could understand.
The deal closer of my talk is that I only talk for about 10 minutes, then I do a full Bitcoin Wallet demonstration where I actually give out a little bitcoin.
if you like, you can see my full talk here on reddit along with slides and graphics.  Feel free to use as you like.

Yes, the coinbase approval process takes a bit of time...  I personally ended up switching over to [coinRnR.com]( because I can usually have my BTC withing minutes of my order.  They are a little bit higher on their buy price, but the speed and reliability have been beating coinbase.
I often have my coinbase order rejected also (after they have had my money for about a week or two) stating that my transactions look fraudulent so...  
I have also been using [ with great success and in addition to getting my coins in person... I have been able to find out about meetups and other BTC events in my area as a result of the newly created connections.

I personally like to distribute my BTC into several paper wallets (usually just regular wallets, sometimes BIP38)... some with only 1 BTC, some with 2 BTC, some with 10 etc.  
I spread the BTC out so that if anything ever happens to one wallet, then I didn't lose everything.
Problem with the BIP38 is the pass-phrase.  When I do a pass-phrase, then I also write that down somewhere so... it gets a bit much for me, and I could likely forget the pass-phrase should I lose the hard copy.
But, maybe what you are asking is "if someone finds my BIP38 wallet... can they hack it?"  My answer would be yes, with enough time they should be able to hack it, but that could take days, weeks or longer depending on your pass-phrase.
Just my 2 cents.
EDIT:  Ooops, I also forgot to mention... there are sites now that insure your deposited bitcoin like circle.com

Actually I like the idea of Transparency for merchants, here's why.  Let's say I buy gasoline from Mavericks (variety store) and they say they only buy US Oil Produced Gasoline.  If I can know their wallet address and trace the BTC to a US refinery (who's wallet address is public) that is when transparency is awesome because I can validate my support. (this is very simplified of course, and not occurring YET... but you get the idea)
So for some businesses, transparency can be an amazing thing if their biz model has some morality or mission statement that can be proven with it, and it matters to customers... Whole Foods grocers is another store that comes to mind that could benefit from transparency.

I believe it depends on which state you live in. the company I work for specifically tells customers there is an additional fee for user credit cards when they purchase our services... and it's very clear.

Ok... purchase BTC from [ and only meet in person.  This will allow you to connect to people in your area that are **heavy** into BTC.  This will give you an edge into BTC accumulation as they can help you out.
Second, to accumulate more BTC (which I believe is a great idea) sell anything you can (I use craigslist and ksl.com), and every time you get even a few bucks, convert to BTC or ask for BTC during the sale.
Third, start posting **GREAT** articles (eXpecially within the BTC - cryptocurrency communities)... very insightful stuff, helpful stuff and leave a wallet address for tipping when you can.  I actually have tipped quite a bit when I find an article informative and helpful.
I have been selling everything I own over the last year and converting into BTC.  I don't know if it will make me rich (and I don't care), but by using BTC for commerce and actively promoting BTC and educating everyone around, and giving BTC to "BTC NOOBs/NEWBs" I hope to have a hand in mass integration and survival.  
BTC/CryptoCurrencies is(are) really going to help lift Billions of the worlds impoverished out of poverty... and that's the **Real Benefit**, and why everyone should be pushing for it's success.

@_date: 2014-10-13 17:15:37
let's take it one step further... how bout all you want to save,  but also liquidate things you have laying around and convert to BTC.  I sold a trashed laptop for $10 bucks.... converted to BTC.

Yeah, I know it (price offered) can be all over the place... I have developed relationships with several sellers by using localbitcoins and I always get a lower price than coinbase. 
So I guess the key is to develop the relationship with the seller that you meet from localbitcoins.  Hell, I have even gotten free BTC from localbitcoins.

I use the Blockchain.info android wallet, and you can set the fee to zero if you choose.  I think fee settings are down on the web, but apply to phone automatically.  So I have a web account and my phone synched to the web with their app.
Let me say this though... fees are a good thing and are minimal, so choose to pay some fees when you can afford it.

buy a little each paycheck... don't worry about the price.  Try and change your buying habits to incorporate companies that accept bitcoin.  Eventually you will be able to convert your whole paycheck into bitcoin, spend only bitcoin, and save what you don't spend.

I give local talks at all of the local libraries about once per month and educate people in a very simple non technical matter about bitcoin. Anytime I go out to eat, take a taxi or any other mom and pop business I always ask if I can pay with Bitcoin and if they are curious but don't know about bitcoin then I provide them more information... if they don't care then I just pay with a credit card. by the way my local libraries - all of them - love me doing the bitcoin talk. The local libraries love anything new and cutting edge and they totally promote with the local news agencies for free.

yeah, coinbase has proven very difficult for me as well, and I just listened to [Andreas Antonopolus on Coinsider This]( and one of the first callers states that 13 out of his 15 transactions were declined because of "suspicion".
These are just the issues we are going to have to deal with as this is all still very new.  coinbase does do some good for the community, but it's a great idea to have a backup!!!!  I love using [ because it also allows me to network with other coiners... and is usually cheaper.

By posting your experience, you make it possible for a person to search "the google" before using papypal, and then they can make a deduction based on information searched.  Your loss may have saved thousands of people.

I continue to try at coinbase about each month.  Just small amounts these days so they don't tie up too much of my money (as they do take the money out of my bank account for about 1 week or so).  I just am trying to be fair, but I have had plenty of success with circle.com (my new favorite) and coinRnR.com. 
Last time I failed on coinbase was about 1 month ago.  I have been using circle about twice per month.
I try and convert most of my paycheck into BTC, then spend BTC with companies that accept it.  Anything leftover at the end of the month goes into cold storage.

In theory the Blockchain could be rolled back, but I don't think you would ever in a million years get the consensus necessary to do it.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:36:15
Interesting.  Basically I feel like you really just want to keep out BofA, JP Morgan, Koke brothers (AKA the fucking trolls) etc.  I believe this is the consensus of all true Bitcoiners.
That being said, couldn't you just have a "private" forum, or even "public" but vet all users.  In other words, there is a qualification period for new members, with a mechanism in place for quickly terminating apparent trolls by existing users or appointed moderators.  Kinda a 3 strikes policy or similar.  The qualification period could be an opportunity to scrutinize new applicants by viewing their current reddit, facebook, twitter history etc.
The Datbtrue forum uses this type of process and seems to keep trolls at 0% quite effectively.
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:10:56

Nice 2.5!!!  It's funny how a few years ago your 2.5 would be 2500 or maybe 25000...  It's ok, you are still an early adopter and we have a long ways to go.
You plan seem great and will likely benefit yourself as well as the community/world.
I have a friend who sells BTC everyday on the [localbitcoins.com]( site and he gets a little pinch for himself every time.  He is doing very well actually and over the last couple years has accumulated a lot of BTC... but each sale is a not even .1 BTC into his wallet... he is patient and tenacious so he's getting to the top (it's the turtle wins the race story).
I like your residual income idea... a few ways I have found to go about it that are fairly safe.
First: Try dropping in Blogs/Posts/Articles that are very helpful and insightful and leave your wallet address.  I recently watched [Andreas and Joe Rogan]( (a podcast-although the first one was better LOL) and during the show, both were receiving tons of BTC donations.  So anything you can leave out there that can generate hits for you will be a plus.
Second: you could try and join a Mining Club like [BitcoinMeNow.com/]( - I know they pay out BTC daily and you end up with more than you would with an outright purchase... not much more, but more non-the-less.
Third: Sell all your shit!!!  If you have anything you can do without... TV, Computer, Books, Bikes, Cars, etc... Sell on [craigslist.org/about/sites]( [ksl.com]( ebay, amazon, etc... and ask for BTC or convert over to BTC using again the [localbitcoins.com]( or even [coinRnR.com](

It depends on what else you are doing as a business, Can these be used to promote your other "doings". 
I don't think the ROI is fast if at all, but if you spread these babies everywhere then maybe your cold storage will be the ROI???

@_date: 2014-06-03 20:34:25
My two cents:  Bitcoin has taught me to save and be frugal in a way I would have never learned otherwise.  I convert as much of my fiat paycheck that I can into BTC and when I need to purchase things I try to only buy from vendors who accept BTC.  
This allows me to always build a slow stock pile of BTC.  I am gradually increasing my stock pile.  I have found that I treat the BTC as such a precious commodity that I really... REALLY qualify my purchases before I sell my BTC.
This method allows me to help propagate/support/nourish the Bitcoin Ecosystem while accruing more BTC... rather than just buy some and hold.
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:46:26


Agreed... it's really really tough to "not" introduce a couple new terms.  
It's funny, in my talks when I start the Q &amp; A session the first thing young people ask is "Can you help me get a wallet", and the first thing old people ask is "Now... where is the bitcoin?" LOL.
We are still several years (or less) away from general public integration, but with "coiners" like you and I going into the public and educating and help the populous for free we will get there.  
Bitcoin is very complex right now, and that's where there is tons of opportunity to be the guys to make it easy for mainstream use!!!!
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:57:08
so are you wanting the card to use Bitcoin through the banking payment gateway system? to integrate your concept into the existing system there would still need to be an intermediary to convert Bitcoin to Fiat. but in the future when more and more retailers are using Bitcoin I would not be surprised to be some sort of NFC operation 4 transmitting bitcoin from consumer to retailer.

He started jumping around dancing and shouting "oh yeah, Bitcoin, that's gonna be huge... probably going to be worth a million dollars each one day"
I was thinking "oh cool, this guy gets it".  I asked "so you have some bitcoin, you are a Bitcoiner" and he said "no"... I was like "What, you think it's going to be worth a million dollars each and you don't have any????? How come"
He said "Well..., well, uh, I don't know.  that's a good question.  I guess I will have to talk to my wife about it and get some.  I never thought about it like that."

Very nice Logical007.  In the last year I have changed my spending habbits as well.  I convert as much of my fiat paycheck as possible into BTC, then shop as much as possible from BTC stores only.  
I use overstock.com, newegg.com tigerdirect.com etc.  When I need something I can't find online (which happens daily) I try to use craigslist or other local interface and ask the sellers if they would accept BTC.
Also, because I convert my fiat to BTC... I end up qualifying my purchases a little more carefully.
It might be helpful to others to post a "how to use bitcoin exclusively" post... because most/all bitcoiners could do more to promote the movement, but common sense things sometimes need to be pointed out.

Interesting point...  I suppose we could talk about/include the deflationary nature of BTC (all CryptoCurrencies really) as the main attribute to drive valuation.  
This would insure a meteoric growth rate over a decade or more even with mediocre implementation/demand.    Kinda like family land handed down generation to generation... eventually the progenies (sp) are filthy rich land barons (I know this isn't the best example but I think you see what I mean).
We also must be aware that there are a lot of **haters** of these new technologies, and they seem to get a lot of airplay.  They have been wrong several times about BTC and so likely as BTC becomes more main stream and accepted the demand will also go up as has been the case with so many other new technologies.
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:34:16
 this is a very nice talk... short, concise and covers the key points.  I have been doing local Bitcoin talks in my area for a while now and I actually give an even simpler talk than this.  I have found that the majority of people who show up for these talks need the information as simple as possible.
My talk takes literally 10 to 15 minutes, then I do a full, live Bitcoin wallet demonstration and then give listeners a little bitcoin for the wallets they make/download (I also print paper wallets live) at the talk. After the demo I take questions which can go 30 minutes easy depending on the size of the crowd.
My talks are done at local libraries and the libraries help me with promotion and marketing.  Libraries love things that help drive in the public!!
I posted my talk on reddit a while ago... feel free to use any components you like.  
FYI, I am in the process of updating the security slide with logos of all the recently hacked corporations.
Thanks for doing talks... we will achieve mass adoption sooner if more of us 'coiners' start politely educating the public.

These are some good questions.
1 - There are many "side chain" technologies in works right now that will allow for "off chain" movement that will be instantaneous as well as CC options.  This is great because it allows for other areas of growth and opportunity.
2 - In the future when no coins are rewarded for solving blocks, the amount of transaction fees in a validated block will likely be HUGE especially in terms of value.  As Bitcoin evolves, the amount of transactions that can happen per second will increase.  Imagine conducting 1 million transactions per second at 1 mBTC each...  That's a lot of Bitcoin.  
3 - Change, Adapt, Anti-fragile, open source
4 - It can be scary depending on how the media disseminates the story.  &gt;50% was much much much easier 4 years ago...  &gt;50% will likely become more and more difficult.   Think about it like this; When BTC is 10,000 USD per coin... you will have every corporation in the world mining BTC (Banks, Walmart, Costco, Mattel etc.) and when that happens there will be hash power coming from everywhere and will secure the network even more.
Just my 2 cents, but up-vote for a great questions(s)

The best way to show your relative the Bitcoin Potential is to let them view some of the Talks... I have seen 3 TED Talks about Bitcoin, and on youtube you can find dozens of videos of Andreas Antonopolis.

well, if you were at peak purchase tier with circle.com, coinbase.com and coinrnr.com you could buy a million usd in btc within a week.  then you could add other sites like cryptsy, coin.mx,  etc to speed things up

~~Fuck~~ skip the cloud mining... You could try a site that does micro loans... in Fiat I hear  or  are pretty good, and I saw this one for Bitcoin  ... I am sure there are more for Bitcoin, but I haven't researched any of them yet... so make sure you investigate a little before you dive in.

mass adoption will fix a lot of this.  I have begun giving talks about Bitcoin anywhere they will let me.  My talks are so introductory that it takes me about 10 minutes, then I open the floor to Q&amp;A.  I explain bitcoin in a way the general public can understand and there is nothing technical AT ALL!!!!
if you want to get rid of misinformation you should do the same.

TL;DR BITCOIN!
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:13:29
just buy to use, and always stash a little extra to the side.  example, if you need to buy something that cost half a Bitcoin... buy three quarters of a bitcoin and keep the extra quarter long-term.  it will be the turtle that wins this race

Agreed... I posted before I watched it and then was shaking my head.  I mean, I give the guy props... he is spreading the word and his heart is in the right spot, and he is doing more than most "bitcoiners" but presentation and delivery are everything.

don't beat yourself up too much, you were just extremely passionate about a really great innovation... your timing probably could have been better and this would be a completely different post but that's a moot point now.  
if you have been involved in that many levels of Bitcoin, you are a Bitcoin expert. Try and use this new talent as a way to generate real income!and real Bitcoin that's where the wealth will be in your future.  
as Bitcoin moves forward over the next five years or so the one thing that is going to be in very short supply is Bitcoin experts, and the ones that are available will probably come at a very high price.

educational purposes? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:44:04
Yeah, it can be scary.  If you think Cryptos are here to stay, and you can stomach the long game... then just sit tight.
For years I have watched people (myself included) buy redeemable securities and the price goes the wrong way and they sell... run scared.  You have to remember always buy low, sell high if your in it to make money.  This means if you bought at $900 you MUST sell higher than $900 or you can dollar cost average of course.
I have bought higher than it is now but I can wait it out.  I bought with "savings" money so it's not money I need to live on, and I am willing to wait for ever.  I believe in the success of bitcoin and every day I try and get a local retailer to start using bitcoin.  I do this, because the more vendors accepting bitcoin the more likely it is to succeed and skyrocket in value.
Don't stress about the price volatility, try and focus on helping push for mass acceptance and use.  These are the biggest factors governing long term price.  Try to get as many people involved as you can and every where you go and spend FIAT ask if they accept bitcoin.  I ask every day, and have actually helped quite a few business accept BTC.

If you are a coder, jump into github and start experimenting... if not, then use the participation page 
and outside of that... just help with mass adoption.  I give talks (almost monthly) at our local libraries... the talks are very rudimentary and have been gaining in popularity.  The libraries love it too.  I do the talks because it allows the "lay" person to come and learn without getting blasted by geek talk.
The block size is important, but so is spreading Bitcoin.

Yeah, sure... it's always tough to convey exactly what you mean in these short text burst.
Basically Bill Gates was articulating a very short term, "in the Now" type of description of Bitcoin.  You would think a person in his position would understand, very well, initial volatility as you can look in detail at microsoft's stock in the first several years and it was quite truculent.  I personally watched people loose millions while others made millions investing in his company.  Granted, MSFT is not the best example to use to support both sides of the argument but I think you will understand my point.
So for someone of his background to inflexibly promulgate an embryonic technology was somewhat shocking to me.  Although, we know media is horrible when it comes to proper representation... so there is that as well.


This can be phrased both positively or negatively.  e.g. when you make 2$ a day, would you want taking the risk to have on day or work's pay be worth DOUBLE of it the following day (forgive the grammar... I was trying to quote verbatim)
Not pejoratively of course, but just to express there are a lot of poor people (speaking personally) that will take the risk if there is a potential upside... just look at the bad odds associated with gambling and lotteries etc.  Poor people flock to these vices.


There are already mechanisms and businesses in place that solve the reversibility (custodial accounts etc).  But even more so, this is the beauty of this new technology (and should be lauded)... the door is wide open for innovations that will solve any issues that come up.  If you need the currency to be reversible, then I assure you there will be dozens of options being developed or have been developed, and will create all sorts of new jobs and fortunes.
So I hope I conveyed my consternation with Bill's statements in a way that is understandable.  You may still disagree with what I have stated, and if that's the case try and research the things you disagree.

My initial limit was $2500 per week (in and out), but this rate goes up as you develop history with them.  On all the other sites I've used I have been able to get to a $10K+ daily pretty quick (usually within a month or 3) so I will test the waters with Circle.com and see how high I can go.
So far their customer service has been very good.  Sometimes takes two days for response, but considering the circumstances I would say this is very good.

I understand your point very well, and am glad to see people thinking about these things.  But this has been done time and time again, and not for pennies.  The documentary I watch was rewarding intercity kids upwards of $100 for grade improvements.  The parents were getting involved and there was a lot of excitement.  However, results were sadly abysmal.  The status quo stayed in place.
But please don't take this to mean "don't introduce crypto to schools".  We absolutely should and it can be a reward system or an economic lesson or both or neither.  It will definitely benefit most if not all students and faculty. 
What I am saying is the incentive system you are proposing based on historical evidence (that you can google and see both in articles and documentaries) has failed every time.  
Now, the khan academy program (and similar) has been shown to work pretty well as can be seen in TEACH and there were no incentives other than the fundamentals in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

Thanks 1000 bits for a great discussion.
I will close by saying **all of us** need to act more professionally in this new P2P environment (bad behavior/trolling might just as likely be a motivator for defaults when we are harassing the shit out of late pays), and we also shouldn't look to the past to solve these new tech problems. 
I think ultimate Blockchain Proof of Existence (thanks Chris Ellis (SP)) might wipe out defaults completely (or close to it) or maybe something. I hate the idea of using existing old bank mechanisms (collateral) when we should be escaping these things and creating bad ass mechanisms to thwart scams and defaults that work instantly and at little or no cost.  Tying collateral is a nightmare!!!! Sounds good on paper, but it's very very difficult to make work in this type of scenario.  Trust me on this one, I have been loaning for a few decades now in the old legacy system.

Good thinking, but unfortunately incentives and the homosapien don't quite work that way.  Or you are looking at it in the wrong direction.
There are already schools that have tried to use monetary rewards (fiat currencies) to incentivize their students to improve grades.  I believe the "TEACH" Documentary shows this and the monetary rewards were actually quite nice IMO.  Much better (even corrected for inflation) than I ever got from my parents or school.  
That being said, students can be driven and incentivized, but not by the method you are prescribing or suggesting.  That doesn't mean we can introduce cryptocurrencies into school.  We should do exactly that, but under a different guise.  Under the premise of learning economics and still allow for monetary reward.  
FYI the schools I volunteer at are already doing similar, but instead of cryptocurrencies they make up their own paper money.  I will get them using CryptoCurrencies before too long.
Here are some articles I found with schools who have offered cash for grades already.  These are all old BTW

@_date: 2015-07-29 21:58:57
First let me say I empathize with you OP.  I got my start in Bitcoin around 2012 and I have been recently investing in BTCJam and other P2P sites as well and on-boarded about a dozen friends.  I had to because I wanted to use the data for some of my Bitcoin Talks locally.
Initially I was quite capricious and whimsical in my first investments, just clicking anything that said "loan request please".  Well you can guess the results.  I had a few delinquencies (not defaults).  After the first few delinquencies (fortunately I only invested about 1 to 5 BTC initially) I decided to treat this system with the respect I give to my investment portfolio and focused primarily on BTCJam (as I saw they had recently been funded by some of the bigger Silicon Valley VC firms) as my vehicle of choice.
I began to thoroughly vet the new investments/borrowers and not just jump into something because the numbers were good.  I would interact with the user in their comments section to gauge how active they were.  Active users got more credit from me.  I would also see who (other users) would vouch for them, or if they were more easily verifiable than other loan request.  I also began to really rely on the credit score created by BTCJam.
Now to date... I have about 150 borrowers that I am becoming exclusive with.  That means, I only make an investment about once per week (sometimes more) when one of my previous relationships post a new loan request.  I have put in more BTC since I have developed this game plan and things are looking much better and my losses (potential losses in reality, as I haven't had any true defaults yet) are evaporating.
I still have those late pays.  Some I hear from and some will likely go to arbitration, but it seems the ones that will go to arbitration will be offset by the gains made with my new protocol.  I will also keep you updated if you request.
I know this is long winded, but I wanted to let you know I share some of your frustration... but I believe there is light at the end of this tunnel.  Here are some of my thoughts moving forward.
P2P lending with Bitcoin is brand new.  There are going to be some bugs to work out.  I believe BTCJam is getting them worked out and their Customer service is amazing!!!  I mean, they are here on reddit posting as I am typing.  Try and be patient as I have seen several of my “late pays” pay late but especially be patient in waiting for the right borrower.  Don't just invest because you feel like you will miss an opportunity.  Be respectful and absolutely professional when commenting to borrowers.  I know for myself if I was late on a loan and was getting trolled to the ends of the earth I might be too embarrassed or too truculent to show back up and make a payment.  Just some food for thought.
Thanks for the post and sharing your situation and thoughts.  It's actions like these that will help get this Brave New Bitcoin World dialed in!!

This is the question of the day that all the P2P bitcoin sites are trying to solve.  It's not as easy as just attaching a title or UCC cert and to be honest that might be the wrong way to solve it.  We are thinking in traditional legacy methods when there might be a new and innovative way to fix this.  Majority of defaults, at least I think, are caused by scammers... so that's where the fix might need to occur.  With honest Bitcoiners there doesn't seemed to be a need for collateral protection.  At least this has been my experience so far.

Thanks for asking. I do need to update this post, but I never stopped investing... I just kept re-investing.  So to date I do have plenty of late pays which will likely go into "arbitration" but overall I am up.  I probably could have avoided the "arbitration makers" but I mostly picked highest risk loans/borrowers after my initial "testing period".  My initial testing period was even worse.  Full of non-discrimination and just clicking any loan so I ate it on a couple there.  Today I believe I have created a list of great borrowers (all the stellar paybacks that I previously have loaned to), and whenever I see one of these "great" borrowers on my list requesting a loan I dump in some BTC. 
So overall I am up, but not as much as I could have been if I hadn't made the "poor choice" investments, but it may have been worth it because now I have a list of really good investments/borrowers.  Some of these borrowers on my list I have already done several loans with.
I will try and update this post with some stats here maybe next month.  I am in my peak busy month right now so as soon as I slow down I will update.   I will leave you with this... initially invest small enough to test (possibly to rate also) and find out who is solid and who is not.  Being late doesn't mean they won't pay back, and if they payback let you get extra fees... so late pay is not too bad, but default is and that takes a while to find out!!!

I believe you are contemptuously implying that I will lose 100% of my invested BTC.  A total loss of 1 BTC.
Well, sounds like a challenge has been offered.  In the interest of high stakes... Let's make it interesting.  I am willing to bet 10 BTC you are wrong.  All of my loans are 90 days or less, so we could see the results of this bet before the end of July.  
If you are willing to put your Bitcoin where your mouth is and continue with your challenge, I believe we can find an appropriate mediator to hold your 10 BTC and my 10 BTC and then see how this pans out.
You have stated I threw away 1 BTC.  I deny the validity your statement and am willing to put my BTC where my mouth is.


I think you are attempting to insult me with this syllogism, although I am not sure why you are so offended I use BTCJam... either way 10 BTC could be yours if you can step up.
I hope you take on my offer... Just think about it, if you are right what great publicity stunt for your promulgations and your career as a prognosticator is launced.  If I am right then BTCJam wins, and I get 10 more BTC out of it.
Let's go for it.  What say you???

@_date: 2015-04-19 23:54:41
Actually there are a ton of business opportunities.  I will cover them as I can, and as my talks allow.
To be honest, I invested in loans all the way down to D- scores (would have gone lower too except I had planned on 100 loans.  I didn't discriminate on score).  When I looked at the scoring system I realized (especially based on my personal score) that the scoring mechanism will only allow for very very fortunate and social peeps to get graded the highest.  For example my score was a D+ because I have no social networks to plug in, and my bank does not allow third party logins (which I don't think any bank should).  
So instead to build my credit I will both loan and borrow and build more slowly over time.  This is actually a lot of fun too, so that helps.  I am very excited to chart the progress over time and demo all the stats in my talks.

Great write up!  The thing that blows me away about this P2P lending phenomenon is the fact that you could literally lend $1.00 (USD) to 1000 peers.  You can literally lend someone a fraction of a penny allow you to really go into a level of diversification we have never seen.
I personally made loans to peers with all sorts of scores.  I wasn't scared off by someone have a low score because you can view the "whys" that give them the low score.  Not too many people have bank accounts or banks that allows them to link to BTC Jam and this is a HUGE penalty on scores, but that same individual may have great social accounts and ID verification etc.
This is truly the way of the future for lending.  It's fast, efficient, supports individuals instead of corporations/banks.  It's about time!

TL;DR - jamie Dimon letter to share holders "There are hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking," Dimon wrote in the letter. "The ones you read about most are in the lending business, whereby the firms can lend to individuals and small businesses very quickly and — these entities believe — effectively by using Big Data to enhance credit underwriting."  
States dimon is annoyed at the frictionless advantage all this new technology has.  And encourages his peeps to start studying big time!

when you submit your bitcoin transactions to the network, they are immediately inserted into the memory pool.  they are then inserted into candidate blocks and  once solved becomes a confirmed block and then you have your transaction with it's first confirmation.   you can conduct transactions in the mem-pool with zero confirmations... its the software you are using that forces you to have 1 or more confirmations.

Man, I just don't know... The financial landscape is changing very, very rapidly though.  Banks are going to have to adopt and change their templates or they will be Blockbuster Video.  Is that in 1 year, 10 years... I don't know.  Can u imagine the banks that embrace this new revolution... they will own the market.


Man, sorry... I'm full of I don't knows.  These are tough questions.  I believe that if we see a few P2P lending/investor leaders (the craiglist so to speak) then the trust will be huge... but if a user is able to default and just jump on to the next 400 platforms... then no, that will be a problem.  But I don't see any reason that one or two P2P lenders won't dominate... No one seems to be challenging them.


I think this will be the case, but it will be corporate insurance.  Not us (or the govs).  Just like we are seeing right now with circle.com xapo etc.


I think we could see a decentralized type of reputation system tied to your Proof of Self... Maybe???


Not yet, that will be next!!  This one took a lot of work, but they give me plenty of fuel for my talks!!

Thanks for continuing the conversation.  Yeah, I was just going with the claim you had stated of "You basically threw away 1 BTC" which now I realize you were being somewhat hyperbolic.
That being the case... you may be right, and even BTCJam has a loss percentage stated which is talked about in some of my original posts.  So what loss exactly are you stating by requesting odds?  10%?


Agreed, 1 or more years is a much better sample.  I can't guarantee where I'll be in a year, and I do these things for my talks to explain how to navigate the Bitcoin Realm.  But, who knows, if the 90 days goes well... I may continue to P2P lend but I have a lot of irons in the fire.

The listing process for the purpose of getting a BTC loan is a little arduous... I think I did it over 3 days, but I linked my Identity, Paypal Account, Payroll, and utility bills... (and sadly that only gave me a D+ rating LOL... it will improve after my first payback).  FYI, if I had accounts like twitter and facebook I would have received a much higher rating, but the only social account I have is this reddit account.  I don't even have a linkedin.
But overall I am very excited about peer to peer funding.  I am also going to load BTC, but I also want to build amazing credit and reputation with these types of funding sites because I believe this is the future.

Very good question.  The "Government" can make Bitcoin less useful than it currently is.  We have examples on both sides of this coin.  e.g. War on Drugs has promoted the drug trade 
That being said, It's likely the Governments will embrace bitcoin (not adopt) and accept just like they accept credit cards in some situations, or cash etc.  Bitcoin is really one of very few things right now that is starting to stimulate jobs, technological innovation and economic growth.  There aren't too many other things right now doing that.  All the representatives of the "state" that I meet and know are very excited about Bitcoin.  They don't understand it at all, but want to.  
TL;DR - yes, sometimes governments fuck up.  I believe this time the evidence is already showing governments will accept bitcoin.

One more questions for you... I am not sure what this means?  I tried to borrow just BTC, but are you saying I am actually borrowing USD through BTC?  So I pay back USD through BTC.  e.g.  Borrowed 100 USD while BTC = 100 USD.  So, borrowed 1 BTC.  BTC climbs to 200, so I payback .5 BTC??? Is this what you are implying and if so, where can I see those settings to change?

It's my understanding that the Wallet (currently forked multi-bit (sp) ) software pares to your multi-touch device (smart phone) via internet... So the current issue is a prototype and not really suitable for offline use, unless I suppose you go set up on a local network that was offline???
But great question... Cold Storage Threshold Keys, interesting.  The premise behind threshold signatures is that you can have a compromised computer or multi-touch device and still be fine because in no one place is there a full key creating a much more effective form of 2FA that is more resilient to attack.  
Now, could an adversary compromise both devices in unison and steal... I'm not sure.  But if they can't, this eliminates the need for cold storage in some cases.

If someone defaults there are no collections, its honor and reputation system, just like in the fiat world (collections exist, but I'm not sure how much money is spent trying to collect vs how much is uncollected).  However, if someone defaults they can pay late.
Here is the strategy that I deployed.  I look at the loss potential against the ROI in aggregate and diversify based on this.  e.g. let's say loss potential is 2% and ROI is 18%.  So in theory if you were to loan to 100 people a total of 100 units, then two of those units should fail to pay... The remaining 98 units should pay 18% putting you at about 116% of original investment when notes are satisfied.  
So key is, diversify and don't dump everything into one loan unless you have other assurances.
If you need more help, I would gladly walk you through the process on hangouts.

I think what they're saying is when you open a blockchain.Info account/wallet you can sweep funds from any other Bitcoin address you currently have the private keys for. This is similar to importing, however when you import there is no transaction fee and the original address still holds the coins (until spent), when you sweep the coins leave the original Bitcoin address and there's typically a transaction fee unless you code the transaction yourself and eliminate the transaction fee

But to your point, it is a certainty at this point Bitcoin is here for the long haul.  don't worry about price, it will come.  You, me, and all of the true "Bitcoiners" are pushing every day for more and more adoption... and adoption is exploding, but we are still at the beginning and 5 to 20 years away from amazing!!!!

Actually what you are waiting for is confirmations... an ossification into the blockchain that confirms the payment is forever solidified and is not reversible.  In all actuality the transaction is virtually instant... it's in the "mem-pool" the second you hit send, but merchants right now (being that this is new uncharted territory) like to see a few confirmations before treating it (transaction) like they own it.
I often times spend transactions with 0 confirmations if I now the source and don't have to worry about the transaction being double spent.  
In the future there will be less "wait" time as people become more comfortable and as double spends opportunities are eliminated through BIP.  There will also be escrow and third party options that will remove this "wait" with out all the cost involved in CC transactions. (cost like 160 billion in friendly fraud each year, bank fees to merchants, late payment to merchants, increased consumer cost to pay all the associated fees etc).
Remember, this technology is brand new... you are saying all the same things that were said about cars when they first came out... or airplanes or the internet.  Relax, don't be in such a hurry... and tomorrow will be amazing.

This is a great post... I think a lot of "Bitcoiners" are pitching everyone they run into every chance they get.  
I sat next to a business owner on a plane last year and we talked about bitcoin.  He was an aggressive Bitcoin hater.  Right off the bat when the word bitcoin came up he started belittling everything about it.  So I responded to his immediate criticisms and within less than a minute I explained to him (very very simply) that "yes, money is one small part of Bitcoin that is being speculated on... but there is so much more to bitcoin".  
Then I gave him examples and when I said merchants can accept bitcoin for free instead of paying Credit Card Fees... every thing change... flipped a complete 180.  Then he actually gave me cash on the plane and asked for bitcoin.  He has been emailing everything he gets on bitcoin every since.  It was a bizarre experience, but I realized he completely changed his whole philosophy once I touched a point that mattered to him.

You have a great point.  I think that if one or two of these sites gains first mover advantage (which it looks like BTCJam might have based on their series A and series B financing rounds and likely IPO this year.) and massive network effect/externality then you have a negative incentive for success of the member... but without that (or even in addition to), a collection concept might be a new business to pursue.  I mean... there's another business opportunity right there!!!
Do you have any code writing skills?  Marketing Skills...  BTCollections.now!!!  Theres an opportunity.  Think about all these resistant corporations that would need some type of CryptoCollector.com as they move into uncharted waters that they know nothing about!!!!!!
If you like, PM me... I have carried dozens of vehicle and property notes over the years and have never resorted to any type of collections.  I have loaned to the scariest credit reports you can imagine... and have always, ALWAYS gotten 100% of my money with other tactics.

I actually have only heard reviews on these P2P lending sites from watching youtubes where people mention them... including Andreas Antonopoulos. He mentions LendingClub and BTCJam as well as Keva.org (implying he is using them or at least that's what I picked up).  But I think only the two I listed above use BTC although keva does have a "team" listed with BTC.
I am currently trying to get a loan on [BTCJam]( (my loan request) and I am loaning/investing as well (just started as I need to talk about BTC P2P lending in my next talk).  So far process is what you would expect... the interface is somewhat "clunky" and not the greatest "UX" but it's definitely good enough.
I will try bitlendingclub next.  After I did the math on BTCJam (loss vs ROI) it seems reasonable to increase your HODLings if you diversify appropriately.  For my first investment attempt I will spread 1 BTC over about 90 to 100 loans indiscriminately.


I am sure it has to be lendingclub.  In my travels over the last few years as a commercial pilot I have heard "regular joes" discuss both Keva and LendingClub (in use applications) but still have not heard anyone speak of BTC Jam.  Even my closest Bitcoining friends didn't know about BTC Jam until I told them about it last week LOL.

No problem, thanks for the post and time... I agree, it's new territory and can be scary.  I don't have the social accounts like facebook and twitter so my D+ rating is as high as it's going to be until after I payback my first loan.
I do plan on borrowing and investing, but my main goal this month is to get to know the system very well so I can give a talk about it and it's potential.
FYI, in the future if you do loans again try and spread them out a little.  e.g. give 10 millibits to 100 people instead of 1 BTC to one person.  This should give you proper diversification. 
I noticed one of my first investors gave me 1/10th of a millibit LOL... and I thought, cool... he's being cautious.  That's great, and that's how it should work.  Will be great for my talk.

The vetting system has really improved, so this will reduce loans to some degree.  But Autoinvest is actually filling loans at lightening speed.  I have been sitting at my PC and received a loan request (automated from a followed borrower) and by the time I get to the link the loan is filled already.  
I don't think they are losing steam (I think they just did a series B funding round), it's always been a small liquidity pool... it's just easier to see how small it is with Autoinvest filling loans almost instantly.

I buy on Amazon via Purse.io almost weekly now.  I buy books for my kids, health and beauty products, computer stuff, lawn and garden... everything I can buy at walmart that's on amazon... I buy amazon first and with the Purse discounts I'm saving bitcoin.  
e.g.  I need $100 USD worth of stuff on Amazon this week, so I buy about $125 USD worth of bitcoin on circle.com, then spend about $90 on purse.io to get the $100 USD worth of stuff on Amazon (cause I usually take about 10% discount... I'm not too greedy).  So I am saving bitcoin twice!!!  then HODL the rest/leftover bitcoin and next week start the cycle all over again.
I also pay for my lawn care in BTC, my haircuts in BTC... anything else I can.  I have been shopping on newegg.com, overstock.com, fiverr.com etc.
Basically I have modified my shopping habits weekly to accommodate using bitcoin and supporting the network (trying to convert my entire paycheck into bitcoin ergo my savings are in bitcoin instead of fiat).  And I changetip like a mother fucker... Not large amounts, but what I can afford.  250 bits @_date: 2015-04-12 14:34:45

Short answer... We don't!  And this can probably be said about 100% of all corporations.  Just look back at the mortgage crises with some of the most regulated and documented corporations in the world (banks) total fraudulent house of cards!!!!  We won't know how legitimate any businesses numbers are unless it's your business and you measured the numbers yourself.
Now that we have that out of the way.  I do trust BTCJam to be trying to be as on the mark as they can.  They are funded by some of the best guys in the industry... specifically BenchMark Capital (indirectly) and Pantera Capital.
And also the fact that some of the best names in bitcoin have acknowledged them and they recently hired Thomas Mann of the World Crypto Network and Bitcoin Group.  He's a total Bitcoin Soldier!!  Fucking HERO!
But good job on you for doing your homework... fielding these questions makes me want to team up with you on a venture as you are obviously attuned to details and have a tenacity for researching!!!

Incorrect.  A transaction is a transaction, and if it's valid (confirmed or not) and meets the established bitcoin criteria it is immediately propagated throughout the network.

I like to use block chain on my PC synced to my Android as my hot wallet, then circle.com as my purchasing wallet  (on pc synced to phone) and anything over a bitcoin goes into cold storage paper wallets until I need it. when I need it, I sweep BTC into my block chain wallet from my paper cold storage.

Yes, the arbitrage angle is very interesting.  Had you taken out a USD tied loan when Bitcoin was about $250 USD for, let's say $4000 USD or 16 BTC, and all you did was HODL, and then paid it all back when BTC was $500 you would have given back 8 BTC and you would be sitting on another 8 BTC.  
It's interesting to think about, and it's also a great reason for BTCJam and other P2P sites to develop FIAT wallets along side the BTC wallets.

it depends on the node you run.  if you run an SPV then size of blockchain doesn't matter, but if you rand a full node like bitcoinQT it would get a little combersome if your computer's not up to the task.
but before we can even do that many transactions we have to increase block size.

I haven't heard of a "bitcoin bond", but it sounds like you want to earn more bitcoin through investment...
check out [BTCJam.com]( It's a peer to peer lending or borrowing pool that runs on bitcoin.  You can earn a pretty nice return and their rating system is based on reputation both ways.  Here is a youtube showing a BTCjam example 
@_date: 2015-03-22 19:31:51
ok.. so assign the most current block header to all transactions.  now I understand what you mean.  this would increase transaction size and not stop double spending.   
UTXOs have their input IDs already.  maybe this is the place to focus? ??
@_date: 2015-10-17 19:02:26
I have been using purse.io for a while now, and sometimes it's insanely fast and other times I've had to cancel the order because it took so long. And it doesn't seem to be the discount is the driver... there are times where I take a 50% discount and it happens instantly and other times where I take a 10% discount and it takes forever. I think the speed with which transactions occur through purse has more to do with the volume of users.

I don't know what wallet you are using, but if you were using Bitcoin-QT then you can go into the console and type 
    importprivkey &lt;your private key here&gt;
If you are using other software then look through your account and settings for an option like sweep or import.  Import is the one you want, but sweep will work but it's treated like a transaction.
Tell me your wallet and I'll see if I can find out the process.

What you are talking about are refereed to as *vanity address*... the more letters you try to include the more difficult they are to generate.

There are server farms who will generate the address for you if you don't have the computing power or know how.

Don't forget I said I buy and spend regularly, so technically it's not an exit.  Just the benefit of a new lifestyle.  Even once BTC is higher in price, I will continue my behavior, but since there is leftover after my monthly purchases I will always have some BTC in "savings" just like if I were using FIAT currency except BTC deflates eventually and FIAT... well, you know.  I've seen you posting here. 
It's just an added benefit of being a Bitcoiner, not an exit.

I have been doing this for a few years now, and it does work. It does get bitcoin on the minds of people and over the years I have seen people that were absolutely resistant now embrace bitcoin I've also seen people that were absolutely resistant to bitcoin accept Bitcoin but not get into bitcoin.
 So you are on the right track and I think most bitcoiners do exactly this....  we promote on a regular basis.
one thing to be aware of, as we bring the newbies into bitcoin please give them good guidance. I hate seeing people lose bitcoin or losing the wallet etc. you are a bitcoin guide. 250 @_date: 2015-03-23 22:50:51

Here is a very nice tutorial on how to set up a instance of TAILS (The Amnesiac Incognito Live System) with Armory Wallet.  You can set up a HD wallet with a mnemonic seed and then should anything happen in the future, as long as you have that mnemonic you should be able to access your BTC some day in the future!!

I haven't looked into the code at Brainwallet.org, but at first guess I would say not necessarily.  Sites can use different methods to convert your string (brain phrase) into a 256 bit number then convert that number into a private key -&gt; public key -&gt; public address.  The later half should always produce the same results regardless of what site or software you use, but the way that the Brain Phrase is converted into a 256 bit number might be different.
EDIT: 
Normally the phrase is a SHA256 hash, but I don't know for sure if all sites and software would stick to this protocol.
So sites could create different Bitcoin Addresses from a Brain Phrase.

Here is how I do it.  I have two (very old) laptops that are completely disconnected from the Internet.  Wifi completely disabled.
On both I have ubuntu and on both I have the website you referenced saved on the desktop (  I also have a printer I bought last year from staples for $29 usd.  It is plug and play only.  No Wifi and I have never bought ink for it (not yet anyway).  I print (usually in triplicate) lots of wallets with it (both encrypted and standard) for friends and family and myself then I laminate them.
Now I also have a persistent TAILS &amp; Amory setup as well, on multiple flash drives.  Here are two great tutorials you can follow for both setups.  Obviously one is easier to initiate, but the Armory setup is better because you can set up a Master Seed for and then you can always recover all of your address EVER!!
first is by James D'Angelo.  GENIUS!!
* [Bitcoin 101 - Intro to Paper Wallets &amp; Cold Storage - Bitcoin Security &amp; Fun with Sloppy Wallets](
* [Ultimate Bitcoin Security: Tails + Armory](
Also you may think about asking in to avoid trolling.
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:59:01
I like where your heads at, this is interesting but a bit confusing to me so I want to ask you some questions.
mem pool -》block template/candidate block -》confirmed block.
I wasn't sure how exactly you would sign a transaction to anything other than a confirmed block? Meaning you would have to have at least one confirmation. On another note I produced transactions to and from wallets with 0 confirmations all the time, so I will often times send a transaction that's in the mem pool, Or spend a UTXO  in the mem pool.

I thought I read in [Adreas' book]( he said all the computers ever created would take 100's of years to brute force a single bitcoin wallet...  but don't hold me to this, I'm looking through the book right now and can't seem to find it.
Either way, the collision factor is considered impossible.  So hacking a wallet is not possible nor practical to attempt.

This can be an issue with brain wallets...  you can go to [bitaddress.org]( and create a brainwallet with the phrase "Satoshi Nakamoto" and then take the generated wallet address over to [blockchain.info]( and you will see several other people have done this as well. 
When you are talking about generating large random numbers.... the odds are just too great for collision.  Collision will occur on a long enough time scale, but not while we still use currency (of any sort).  
More at risk are the generation of these "random" numbers... that seems to be more of an issue.

@_date: 2015-02-04 12:44:24
So one thing I have been seeing that is become popular and necessary is running a full node and then offer API services... like JSON RPC... like blockchain.info does and so many others.
So you offer this service, and then have two packages.  One for free that has limitations e.g. 1 call per second or whatever, then offer a premium package with all sorts of freedom and tech support.
There are going to be so many companies that need these 3rd party APIs because they won't know how to do it themselves.

Man this is great news for more than one reason.  It stands to reason that if the Bitcoin Community is pushing for SENS to accept bitcoin, the Bitcoin Community is highly educated and very well read.

Rather than take it down I wonder if there is a way to throw it in their face daily...  A giant digital way of say "Oh yeah, like the time you fucked up the Cryptsy story".  Any time they publish new news this giant "retard" flag would pop up.

TL;DR - Bitcoin as a travel tool: Lost my wallet while traveling international to Germany.  No CC, no cash... nada.  Was able to been up with a localbitcoiner in Munich and exchange BTC for fiat.  Waitress in the states found my wallet at the Charlotte Airport.

So, finally got done watching this whole video.  There were some great concepts covered...  Morality, Politics, Regulation, Legal Consent etc.  The last 20 minutes I found myself getting pumped up like I do when I watch Andreas Antonopoulos.
The Nigerian fellow loves regulation, but regulation is already Bitcoin's strong suit (mathematical regulation).  Government regulation does nothing to stop crime, in fact, it might foster crime.  Instead, why can people just agree to enforce the laws that already exist (and get rid of laws that violate rights).  
If someone were to buy a nuclear warhead with bitcoin...  Then focus on the criminal act and prosecute the suspect for possession of a warhead.  If a criminal orders a hit on his ex-business partner and pays with bitcoin... arrest him for solicited a hit.  It seems so simple to me.  There already is an abundance of regulation and laws... start enforcing them and quit worrying about making new ones.
@_date: 2015-02-14 22:58:25
Sure, at some point someone (i.e. government, criminals etc) will try and seize your coins by force (deadly).  Multiple wallets, Multi Sig wallets, cold storage wallets, and wallet custodians and machines we haven't even dreamed up yet,  etc are going to be ways to prevent complete robbery.
One of my clients had a judgement forced upon him in which the state showed up at his bank and took all the money out of his checking and savings account and since that didn't satisfy the judgement they then took money out of the accounts he had set up for his children (and months later they were actually proven in court to be in the wrong and the money was returned... but not until my client had spent about double the judgement in legal fees :( ... ). 
Point being, they can't take it if they don't know it exists... multiple wallets with "lay around" wallets for theft (from James D'angelo).

if you really want to get a grip on how much a Bitcoin could be worth in the future you should check out James D'Angelo's videos as he is a PhD from MIT and probably second only to Andreas Antonopoulos 
then he also has a live modeling interface here

Great idea! There are a few solutions to reversibilty, one being off-chain custodial accounts (can of worms, but an example non the less) etc.... the important thing is that with Bitcoin we are able to innovate and fix any problems that can arise!

There are full nodes which carry a copy of the full blockchain, there are Simplified Payment Verification nodes (SPV) which carry a smaller version (1000 times smaller so in the MB size instead of GB) of the block chain (just headers) great for phones etc, there are mining nodes (can be full nodes also), stratum wallet... there are other options.

One thing nations and people have taught us is that they will jump onto whatever the next better thing is.
Currently about 18 countries (not solid on this number but it's close) use the US Dollar as their own currency.  Ecuador is one country that uses the US Dollar and has declared they are going ot make their own CryptoCurrency.  
I think there are about 16 countries that are in the EU and use the Euro.
Now with that being said, when I am along the Canadian borders I can use US Dollars or Canadian Dollars... So the point I am trying to make is that a countries dollars are often not the domain of just the issuing country.  Hell I can even buy Zimbabwe dollars on amazon, and I can tip with them here in the USA.
So with a historical look at money I think it's safe to say that before long most every governance will be accepting bitcoin and therefor using and spending bitcoin (even if it's an instant exchange situation at first).  This is simply based on how foreign currencies in all countries are being treated now.
So then we get to your question.  Who will be first... Initially I thought the USA might be last, but then I saw this [NH plan for the state to accept bitcoin]( and I was like... "oh, I guess the USA might not be too far out from integrating bitcoin"... here is the reddit discussion 
So I don't fucking know who's going to be first, but if a few of these local govs jump on... everyone will follow and I am very excited.
I have said it before and I'll say it again.  The toughest thing about being in Bitcoin is waiting.

@_date: 2013-11-29 01:32:36
It could be transaction fees, It could be sense of purpose.  It could also be companies that benefit from BTC would focus some resources on mining to ensure it's long-term survival.  
Just like people entertain us on the web and video for free all day long, there will always be some category of miners that do it for the sake of doing it.  There will also be greedy bastards.

That's fine... just use [coinbase]( to get your BTC, then transfer the coin to another wallet or your phone and then you should be good.

hmmm.  That's interesting idea.  Might be worth creating a site to focus exclusively on philanthropy in this realm.

@_date: 2013-11-29 04:27:07
IMO, yes... but it depends on what your overall goal is and how you tolerate stress LOL.  I currently don't mine because I felt like upgrading my computer would cost me more than just buying some coin at the time, and I was correct.  Mining is a fun learning experience, but you need a dedicated system.
