You'll need your wallet.dat backup file and or your public/private keys tin addition to your password. Knowing the public/private and password woudl let you 'spend' the bitcoins or transfer them to a new wallet that you could then do w/e you want with them.

It was a withdrawal from the savings account. I don't see the issue. Its no different than any other transfer. 
I think the bank representative was just being a dick.

Because urs an unregulated, and largely unrecognized currency. Big governments want to see button fail.

Yeah, not sure if that one will ever be beat...

While powerful I don't think they match up to Tiananmen Square.  
Raising the flag? Powerful, but those men were there to fight and were taking that hill.
Moon landing, impressive and inspiring but not powerful.
Atomic bomb, another impressive and scary device created by men in a lab.
The tank man is much more powerful. He wasn't there because of science, because someone told him to do it, he did it because he felt it was right. That's a lot more powerful statement, at least in my eyes.

I think he meant the problem being solved was not giving away his cc info.. But anonymity is basically a huge main feature of bitcoin so its a bit redundant.

k. What's that have to do with the differences between planes and trains.
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:34:35
What the fuck are you talking about? How is it any different than the millions of users who already have their computers on all day?
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:58:49
But.... its more than one cpu.
12 satoshi an hour X 1 million computers = .12 BTC per hour over 24 hours is 2.88 BTC
@_date: 2014-08-12 14:09:45
How does it make no sense? Trains are ground vehicles, planes fly at ~35k feet. So thats a difference between planes and trains.

True. But less profitable for the website owner.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:53:23
Very true. That sounds like an even better solution. Websites could join program with asics makers, 1 asics per person and then if the correct website is detected it starts mining.

Pretty sure he's saying that the Tiananmen square picture is more powerful.
Just a wild guess.

I'd cancel my account if I was you. Just out of principal.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:32:10
Yes. I know how a computer works. But how would it not be a good idea? There are millions of computers out there constantly running and drawing watts.

Ummmmm.... Bitcoin and "Coin" two completely different types of products... How and why would someone compare them if not just for webpage hits?

I'm guessing yes. He would have intercepted your gvoice number.
@_date: 2014-10-01 03:25:57
They would just have to turn off the power grid, that should protect a lot of the gov's networks in the area.
Plus if power was off most people would flock to their mobile/battery powered devices. Increasing the number of devices being affected.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:44:26
Don't forget that any bitcoins you turn into USD will have to be claimed as income. So really unless you get paid in and buy only through transferring bitcoins there isn't much the IRS can do. If you fail to claim income from the sale of bitcoin though, then they can.

This just in! 
President Obama just farted! Didn't affect Bitcoin!

So what exchange did you go buy? An avg?

Look at NY's common core, they're not trying to eradicate creativity but encourage it! Just the opposite of what you said. What the state is doing for the students here is great. I wish we had had the common core back when I was in school, I probably would have been much much smarter and more successful than I am today.

Why don't you just buy $30 of bitcoins...?

@_date: 2013-11-08 19:46:41
That would be what he probably wants. Then he can buy gain at a lower number and make more profit later on...

woah woah woah... internet is a currency now?
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:55:03
AHH. See it now. ( I saw the QR code) missed the BTC text! I feel like an idiot now.

Looks like a fine address to me.. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:57:12
I meant, real bitcoin address. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:08:28
When I first heard of Bitcoin I was a freshman sitting in my dorm going 'that's neat', then saying, damn I should really get a job instead of wasting time on the internet. Got a job scooping ice cream at Ben &amp; Jerry's on campus. All i got was fatter and lazier, with a little bit of money. If I had spent $20 on bitcoin I'd be in a completely different place right now.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:50:32
I dont' get it
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:16:36
Now I must go on a search for someone deserving of a tip!
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:06:42
Sign up for [bitcointip]( and start sharing bitcoin(s) with others to increase the knowledge and expand the currency.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:39:27


That's the address I got :) I'd send you something to test, but I don't have any money in my phones wallet right now :/
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:53:27
A I was hoping that'd be a real address...
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:16:50
If i were a business owner of a small brick and mortar/mom-pop store I would take the chance on bitcoin for three reason.
1) chances of someone in the small town knowing or using bitcoin is slim.  
2) The limited use would give me time time to learn and grow with the system.  
3) If i didn't convert right away I could potentially make a lot in the long run.
Of course if it started to pick up (usage) i would probably start converting 75% of it right away and only leaving a small amount in bitcoins.
