Was your spouse in on the business or did you keep that to yourself as well? How did you get started on the darknet and what made you want to do it?

What about in terms of physical security? If you don't mind sharing that information. Did you ship internationally or domestic only?

He says that he stopped being a vendor before the LE got to him. His old Bitcoin tumbler ratted him out when they got busted.

How did your wife react when you got arrested? 
What steps did you take when first starting out as a vendor in terms of opsec

It's a bummer. He might be legally obligated or watched by LE so he doesn't want to. If his claims are legitimate, his opsec was incredible.

I'm not OP bro, but also something I would like to know

Until next August. A good year, and I might sign a new lease at the place if this becomes profitable-ish.  just need to know how long until I break even on the initial investment and if it's a worthwhile venture in the end.

Thank you for the link. Is there anything I need to know, like setting it up-wise?  I've looked around and some of them have warnings about the voltage inputs, saying that they should be powered with two PSUs because normal outlets in the US don't output that much? Should I avoid those? 
Also, is the coinminer one a good buy? I could probably buy 2 of them with my budget.

What's the ICO
@_date: 2019-10-30 00:16:31
Don't forget about the wife.
@_date: 2019-10-10 07:53:51
Ok. Thank you for everything you've sent. Will do more research and calculations :)
@_date: 2019-10-10 02:26:26
Not paying for power/utilities, just my rent, which is a flat rate monthly. Going to take advantage of this, but I know nothing about mining. Been into Bitcoin for a couple years though.

Yea, i definitely know they're loud. I'm going to read all the fine print in my lease and see if there are any potential problems with it, but I do want to try it. The concept of getting money for free is tantalizing.

In terms of calculating how long it will be until I break even on the investment, how do I do that? Look up the hash rate and divide that by however much my miner will hash?
@_date: 2019-10-10 02:32:25
I'm living in an apartment complex for students. Not a dorm exactly, but basically that. I'm only paying rent, and as per the lease it's not my problem they'll be wasting a bunch of power....

My theory: the prophecy was made by a Bitcoin whale. Easily able to manipulate the price of Bitcoin and therefore knew the outcome in certain times. Prove me wrong.
@_date: 2019-10-10 02:26:52
Even with the fact that I'm not paying for electricity?

Good
