you are right about the Ethereum

yes, I think soon the big companies are going to use cryptocurrencies for transactions in future. This move by the Belarus government will definitely benefit the IT companies &amp; startups.

yes, indeed you can use Bisq as well to buy BTC as it is decentralized ;)

I think, this time price might go below $5,600 if SEC completely deny the decision of ETFs getting listed. Most of the big investors are still waiting for their decisions. But as of now, the market is getting healthy if we don’t consider the external factors such as regulatory issues, frauds, scams etc. 
The market is still new and way more to improve in the long run ;) 
Also if we talk about the market cap of Bitcoin (~$115B) which is nothing, if we compare it with Forex and capital market. 
And I don’t expect Bitcoin to touch the ATHs till 2020. But we will see a MAJOR BULL RUN in 2021 when the BTC/block get half. 
From 2017- 2020 its is 12.5 BTC/block whilst in 2021 it will be 6.25.
SO investing now in BTC might give fruitful results in 2021 and I expect Bitcoin to reach $50,000-$60,000 or maybe more.... ;)

Yes, the bottom is still awaited before the rally towards $8000. Hopefully, we could see a small correction in upcoming days.
I think there might be less possibility for Bitcoin to hit $4,500 now. It might approach towards $5800-$5,500 not less than that. ;) 
My opinion!! ;) can’t say much about the market as it is highly volatile now ;)

My target for Bitcoin price is $2000- $2200 and it might strike in Jan-Feb 19. But let's see when &amp; how the "big whales" interrupt in between.
