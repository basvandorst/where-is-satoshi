If it drops below 9k I think I'm going all in.

Reminds me of that "bitcoin millionaire" kid who dropped out of high school.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:54:36
Or he's just too lazy/stupid to learn about new technologies.

I wish I had a friend who told me about this shit years ago. Imo you should keep talking about it with people who might be open to it. I saw it mentioned a little bit somewhere in the internetz of course but was too lazy to find out more about it myself and completely forgot about it for years. I used to be so fucking lazy as a kid, literally just played wow or something 24/7. Propably the biggest regret of my life.
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:13:21
Yeah, he likes simple because he's not as smart as people think he is. He just made some lucky bets and had the patience to see them through. The world was a much simpler place back when he made his money.

And you're one of those people that believes Trump must be a genius just because he's rich. He's just really confident in himself and feeble minds(like you) fold over in the presence of a confident mind. That's all there is to Trump really. All show no go. He's got retards like you thinking he's playing 5 dimensional chess with the world when in reality he's exactly as stupid as he seems.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:15:26
Yep, there's a difference between being right and just being lucky.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:54:36
Yeah, and it's going down all the time as people are losing their coins every now and then. In theory, given infinite amount of time, wouldn't all coins be lost eventually? Kinda strange if you think about it.
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:33:59
One of the stupidest things I've seen in my entire life. It's literally as stupid as the "blockchain not cryptocurrency" meme the institution and governments are still stuck at.
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:21:58
Learn how to drop my IQ so low that I couldn't understand new tech? No thanks bro, I'm good.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:53:27
Yeah but like, why not trade AND hodl though. If you believe it will go up eventually like hodlers do then you literally can't lose. Just HODL as long as is needed to sell at a profit. You fuck up a trade -&gt; turn it into a HODL position Instead of selling low etc.

Damn, 8% is way higher than I expected. What this says to me is that most people who are going to get in are propably in it already. 100k bitcoin is starting to look VERY unlikely. If this is true I see it as one of the most bearish news in a long while.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:41:12
He's a pretty good salesman lol. That's exactly what he wants you to do.

@_date: 2018-03-07 19:38:27
Yeah but like...you still need to buy food so.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:24:24
Somehow I don't think 2018 will be anything close to what 2017 was and I fucking missed it :(. Been kinda depressed about it for months and it's not going away. Now I'm still in it for the tech ofc but it would've been nice to get rich too lol.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:06:44
It's the retarded libertarian bullshit that is preventing mass adoption tbh.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:02:59
Your title is misleading clickbait brah.
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:16:13
Spoken like a true bitcoin shill!
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:32:26
"When's the last time you heard someone regret buying Bitcoin?"
Plenty of people who bought around 20k regret buying.
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:11:49
Puamp it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:38:46
Haha "Putin's word" hahah...hah....ha...haa.
@_date: 2018-03-24 02:31:36
It's too late to get in now.(kinda agree with this)
It's a scam.
Governments will ban it.
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:45:08
Get ready for a big dump lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:07:47
Or he'll just be dead by then :D, he's kinda old so.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:38:53
Of course, the bubble has popped. SELL NOW!
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:28:05
Bigger than internet? Lol. He's just excited because it made him really fucking rich lol.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:37:22
Most of the alt coins are literally just people hoping to get in on "the next bitcoin" early this time around. It fucking sucks to come in late to this game and realize you missed the "get rich just by HODLing train". Easiest money in the whole fucking world and you missed it. You fucking missed it. Just gotta let it go man....just let it go.
(BRB killing myself)
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:44:46
Yep, they've all heard about it now but I literally don't know anyone who's actually bought any. It's in their minds now so the next time it goes up the FOMO will be something we've never seen before. Your hairdresser will actually be BUYING bitcoin next time around, not just talking about it.
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:05:42
"Buy when others are fearful."
In this case the "others" were the TA guys talking about it dropping to 3-5k. They were afraid. Everyone was afraid around 6k. That's when you should've bought. You didn't.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:06:37
BULL TRAP ALERT!

"Can't tell you how many people avoided buying at $200 when I was telling them to buy one coin and sit on it for years."
I wish someone told me earlier :(. I heard about it in some podcast last year. Some guy talked about the very basics of how it works and it sounded interesting so I looked more into it (also the fact that GPU prices were suddenly going up got me interested aswell).   Before that I think I only heard about bitcoin very briefly when the silk road thing happened but nothing after that so I just assumed it kinda died and forgot about the whole thing and was too busy/lazy to do a google search about it :(. One fucking google search. FUCK.
My point is keep telling (open-minded) people about it, but not just "buy buy buy" that only puts most people off in my opinion, but more like the basics of how it works and such(makes sense since if you just blindly buy buy buy what other people tell you to you're going to get very poor very fast).
@_date: 2018-04-12 04:28:36
1 in 5 ? No way.
@_date: 2018-04-08 05:21:28
Heh, if bitcoin is 1 million in 2020 I will travel to america and suck McAfee's dick off lol.
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:31:39
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:51:36
Yeah...that doesn't make any sense whatsoever lol.
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:21:48
He looks like he's dead or something when he's listening wtf?
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:22:42
The dude has so much money he could've easily helped pump the price himself to that 10k prediction.
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:48:32
I want you to imagine who you sold to at 6700. It was propably some richfag who's now laughing at you. He's literally pointing and laughing at you with his richfag friends. Let that sink in for awhile. 
Now go ahead and buy those exact SAME COINS back from that SAME RICHFAG at a higher price so he can have a good laugh again.
You dun fucked up son but it's ok, you need to sell low at least once to really learn the lesson. Keep that in mind the next time you feel the urge to suck that richfag's dick again.
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:44:24
They don't give a shit about any of that. They literally just want to buy because other people are buying. That's it.
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:38:30
I think a very big percentage of people have heard about bitcoin but still a very small percentage of people actually own any.
