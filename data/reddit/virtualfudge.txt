How can you have internet without an ISP? Internet still requires infrastructure i.e. cables, routers, servers. And the institution of a blockchain doesn't remove this need. Perhaps it removes the need for a domain registry (enter Namecoin) but not ISP's. Your other points are well made.

Definitely. It would we horrible if the world switched to bitcoin but built a fractional reserve system on top of it. It would defeat the purpose of bitcoin and it wouldn't even be that different from what we have today.

I wonder if Satishi would ever weigh in on a bitcoin hardfork in thus fashion. He could easily dump his hundreds of thousands of "deadcoin" and then the rest of the community and network would follow suit, no doubt.

I'm envisioning bitcoin startups going public on a decentralized stock exchange....
I want on that train.
