I know nothing about coinswitch, but it sounds like you're talking about an exchange website.
Exchanges don't 'convert' the crypto you send them instantly.  You would send BTC from your original wallet/exchange into your Coinswitch BTC wallet.  
From there, if it's like other exchanges, you can either convert your BTC into ADA for a small fee, or trade it manually on their exchange.
Currency conversions *never* happen by sending one type of currency (BTC) to a wallet intended for another type of currency (ADA).

The number of HODLed coins is miniscule compared to the number of coins forever locked into the blockchain on forever-inaccessible wallets.

You just debated yourself, but I can't tell if you won or lost.

Just a few more car-crash metaphors, and I might finally realize that you're addressing correlation/causation.
Sometimes, things correlate *because* one actually does cause the other.  
Like when a government cuts taxes, fails to cut costs and increase revenue, increases the deficit instead, and has to borrow more to keep from shutting down.
It isn't mysterious.  It's Kansas on a national level.

Which makes your original statement more like:


Which is still an odd and silly statement.  Of course it does.  
Especially if statistical evidence suggests that doing 95 with no seatbelt is a very good way to die in a crash.
These particular tax cuts are doing 95 with no seatbelt.

Market manipulation can do that.

Woah, your grammar deteriorated hella fast.
Did you plagiarize your original comment?
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:21:29
You got so lost projecting your insecurities that you failed to notice that *two different* people think you might be kinda dumb.
Maybe you're funnier in 'your language', but in English you look lazy and uninformed.
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:21:43


Pretty accurate?

I'm sure he'd be flattered that you think about him while talking to strangers.
Kinda creepy, tho.

I'm not interested in pretending you have useful information.  None of this is useful, so I'm not particularly disappointed.
You're just temporarily amusing.  I push this button and you say something dumb.  
You're basically an app for nonsense phrases.  And I expect nothing more from you.
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:29:21
But you're kinda boring.
Like, do you always try to set up interactions so that, if a person leaves you out of disinterest, you win?  
That seems kinda sad.
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:47:43
I was never interested in 'arguing' with you.  Nothing about the way you've expressed yourself has implied that you have an opinion worth unearthing.  
I'd honestly rather debate a hamster.

It isn't a 'promotion' if he's a moron.
If no one accepts that Famous = Guy You Should Listen to About Investing, it only looks bad.

If he's paying attention today and bought back in, he made decent money.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:37
After everyone bought up that 9200-9300 dip, yeah.
That's what I mean:  if he was paying attention.
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:18:16


Aww, and there you go becoming a cliche.
Oh well, was nice while it lasted.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:53:57
Sir, are you lost
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:52:08
Sounds like a No.

I wager you're astonishingly wrong, about that.  If for no other reason than most people *hate* paying bills.  
I don't currently pay a "roadway maintenance bill".  I pay direct taxes on the fuel and tires I buy, which directly relate to how much I impact those roads.  
I don't pay a "military upkeep bill", and the idea hardly makes sense.  How do I, or anyone, quantify my personal benefit in order to bill me directly for my benefit?  What if I don't pay?  How do you remove my benefit?
It's a convoluted logistical nightmare that, thankfully, doesn't exist.  Because we just tax shit, I don't have to manage, pay, and track hundreds of tiny bills from hundreds of tiny services from thousands of potential providers.  
Perhaps we end up with *massive* Public Services Umbrella Corporations that monopolize communities and, assuming they can track the data, send households one bill for their monthly usage of provided benefits.  
And which point one has to ask, why?  You've essentially created a profit-motivated bastardization of city government, because taxation didn't feel fair.

I think you're getting hung up by this.  All purchases are willful contributions.  If contributions are mandatory, it's taxation.
I don't think most people have an interest in paying other people for the ~~right~~ privilege(?) to step off their property.  Publicly owned and maintained spaces aren't an evil upon the world.  They're just sensible.

In a quest to find a reliable resource for crypto-related information, I accidentally stumbled upon this sub.
One greasy, insufferable circle-jerk later, and my quest continues.
Godspeed, HODLerzz

Except it isn't.  The "free market" has no innate intelligence.  It's just people, buying products and services.  
Stupid people buy stupid products for stupid reasons.  I'd rather not have infrastructure depend on that.
Anything less 'free' is regulation, which is apparently a bad thing.


Or I can just look at the clusterfuck known as Oklahoma.
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:14:27
The libertarian free-market approach only works if a populace is educated and *cares*.  Americans, generally, are idiots too distracted by lizard-brain pleasures to give two shits about meaningful societal progress.
Do *you* want the quality of your roads determined by the willful contribution of your neighbors?  I sure as hell don't.
