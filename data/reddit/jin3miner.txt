Yes, I can send you both fans with grids and screws. One was running for approx 50 days, second 5 days. 
My price is 0.007 BTC ($3) + shipping cost in BTC
Let me know which country you are from and I will check the price of shipping.

I live in very small apartment, the noise from original fan was big problem for me. Now it is 19dB, very quiet.

Yes, but the noise is only 19dB. It is basicaly silent.

I don't know, it depends on difficulty increase. First antminer is mining since march and mined enough to buy second one. But I don't care about ROI too much, mining is my hobby anyway.
I live in very small apartment, so I did not like how noisy default antminers are.

I allready sent you PM.

Yes, two 120mm fans instead of one 200mm would work too, but my goal was to make it as quiet as possible. Big 200mm fan needs only 700 RPM to reach the same CFM as original 120mm fan with 2600 RPM.

My 2 antminers s1 takes 745W from wall. So yes, it produces quite a lot of heat. It is important to keep them under 50°C. It hashes 360 - 370 GHs/s (no overclock). I run them 24/7. If the air is too hot in the hall, I simply open window. 
Boot time is approx 1 minute, I would suggest much longer cycle for switching on and off.
Unfortunately we have spring now so the extra heat is no more needed :(
S1 Antminers are quite cheap now, it is 0.55 BTC ~ 250$. I paid 0.89 BTC and even more for the first one + two PSU, 4 fans...
Do your own calculations if it is profitable for you.

Sorry, I could not. I published all photos I made during the process. You can click the photos on imgur to make them bigger.

What info do you want?

All of them paid with bitcoin. It was not a bitcoin, but a babywearing meeting.
