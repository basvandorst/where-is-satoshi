@_date: 2017-12-31 00:46:00
I didn't see that option, I'll look again.

Why? Hire an accountant to do it right.

Aha, so they pick which TXs basedo n which have the most fee?
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:28:35
So how does the transaction fee come into play? The miner selects which TXs to include in a new block?

None taken.
There's also  which uses D6 to generate digits for a large number in Base 6 - the issue raised is a "slight bias in conversion" since the conversion doesn't map evenly: "This means that some of the possible outputs are twice as likely as the others."


I wanted to write it myself to directly map the least significant bit of dice / coin &gt; private key text, without any intermediary steps or requiring you to keep a copy of a wordlist.

So he picks which TXs go into the block, choosing the most TX fee?

Hi I just made this and wanted to share. If you see something wrong with the code please let me know =)
Inspired by  but instead of their hexadecimal dice, this code uses 6 sided dice or coins.

Where are you seeing these things (LN) announced? I didn't see on bitcoin.org or  ?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:31:06
Is this with regular BTC, not cash?
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:06:00
Can you explain further?

My problem isn't that they are using tech, but the *patent* on it. A lot of this wording like "data stream" is pretty vague.
Let's say I build a bitcoin business selling 3d printed trinkets for BTC.
I develop a tool to analyze blockchain transactios and correlate transactions with my user's cart. Then I display this information.. does this cover the patent?
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:05:52
That.. is beautiful.

Thanks, it was longer and much drier than that. Talked a lot about the uses of cryptography. Good find though, thank you!

What's up with Coingeek?
"Importantly, Wright notes that “bitcoin was designed to be a monetary system that works within existing legal frameworks”. This differs from the path other developer groups are trying to follow where they are creating an anonymous system along the lines of E-gold and Liberty Reserve"
Literally read the Introduction to the whitepaper.
