Letting helpless people suffer in a country so wealthy. THAT is violence.
Demanding that someone pay their fair share back to society in order to enjoy the benefits of that society, I don't know how you make the leap to calling that violence.
As Benjamin Franklin said, "All the Property that is necessary to a Man, for the Conservation of the Individual and the Propagation of the Species, is his natural Right, which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition. He that does not like civil Society on these Terms, let him retire and live among Savages. He can have no right to the benefits of Society, who will not pay his Club towards the Support of it."

Isn't United Way relatively bad charity that spends way too much on "administration" and coerces people to donate at the workplace? They won't be having any of my bitcoins.

You're right. It looks like they have cleaned up their act in the last decade or so after a series of [scandals]( in the late 90s and early 2000's

This can't be right. If there are only $100 in circulation, where will that extra dollar come from unless it is itself created (printed) somehow?

You are free to leave civil society if you wish, then you have no responsibility to it but trying to enjoy all of the benefits of society without paying your fair share towards it doesn't make you more free. It just makes you an asshole and a leech.

Well, since banks can lend 20 times as much money as they actually have, they essentially create money out of thin air when they make a loan. It is possible and even probable that the sum of those loans exceeds the total dollar supply.

I'm sure this is a dumb question but I have about 1 coin. Is it safe to keep it at Coinbase?

But isn't that reserve only 10% of the loans?
