Yes, it was me doing a poor job. Either way sorry for wasting your time again. Being hungover isn’t a great excuse for being horrible at English.
Have a good one man, sorry if I annoyed you.

You have missed my entire point, which is fine. Was hungover anyway, have a good day

This is not Forbes. This is a Forbes contributor, you can go post an article too if you want.

This is a Forbes contributor.  This is not Forbes itself saying it. Anyone can be a Forbes contributor. I mean cool this one guy says this, but he does not speak on behalf of Forbes.
Like I could go make a Forbes post too. So. I mean cool, I love bitcoin. But what.

To be fair these were probably posted by Forbes contributors and not their actual employees. Aka two random people on the internet with different opinions.

Anyone can be a Forbes contributor. You or I can post an article on there was my point.

It’s saying don’t risk more than $20 on technology that isn’t finished yet. This could be $5 if you don’t wanna lose $5. 
The amount is meaningless. The point is the software isn’t finished so bugs can happen.

It says lightning network isn’t for $20 payments, it isn’t right now. But as a whole it isn’t either, as Large payments scale fine on bitcoin it’s the micro transactions that need the minuscule fees when everyone is using the network constantly in a future scenario. It’s not saying it can’t be used for it.
Not sure what you are getting from it, seems very clear.

No the lightning network isn’t for $20+ transactions. This does not mean it can’t be, but right now especially with a chance to lose it.
The network wasn’t created to process $20+ purchases. It was designed for the every day quick swipe transactions that make up the bulk and need to be fast and free. It’s extremely clear. The intention of lightning network isn’t for $20+ transactions.
I’ll say it again. The lightning network was designed with the idea for quick and easy solution to fast and small payments.
I’ll say it again. The lightning network was designed with the idea for quick and easy solution to fast and small payments.
There is however no artificial barrier making it impossible to do a $9000 transaction. That’s just not the main problem it’s trying to solve.
