Diversification is for retail investors. I’m a strong hand around here and I have a wide knowledge base. Separating me from my coins is going to be hard.

My magi is still under, next year I’ll probably be over the limit and I’ll make use of the Backdoor Roth loophole.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:23:39
What’s your shitcoin of choice then?
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:53:32
Lol me too friend 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:52:45
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:06:08
They should have been more. I just don’t have the courage to hold GBTC in the Roth with the ridiculous premium, but obviously by day trading it instead of hodling it, I ended up with way less then I should have. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:13:48
Wait. You’re serious? I can’t tell. Seems like you’re a serious lol
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:51:58
Lol stay skeptical chief. The jews did 9/11 amirite??!?!
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:19:50
I think we will see alts staking into bitcoin in the future via atomic swaps. So not really a proper side chain. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:02:45
For me never. think about anyone who got rich, they got rich on one thing usually. Even warren buffet is a filthy liar, there were plenty of times in his early career where he went close to all in on various trades. Geico essentially “made” him. As long as I continue to feel great about the project and it’s development and as long as we aren’t compromised in any specific way I will be hodling. Do you really want to sell coins now and have to get back in around a million a coin, because you need them to do business with? The future is bright and the next two years look bright as fuck. Watch out for a pre halving crash though in 2020.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:53:32
I plan to hodl forever. I have enough coins that my decision is meaningful. There are many others like me. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:09:04
We’re not there yet.
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:31:39
I would except i have 350k left on the loan. At 5 million net worth I will pay it off and be entirely debt free. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:46:20
I only hodl, I don’t dump on noobs. Of course im in it for myself, but I’m also in it for the world.

Deflation is the whole point of the system you idiot. It was set up this way on purpose. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:10:39
Ethereum is not sound money. Totally different use case. It’s also a centralized scam, but hey I’m a bitcoiner ;)
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:04:19
First of all why would I want to cash out back to fiat? I’m not in bitcoin to get more USD. Secondly I can sell this in one fell swoop on gdax or Gemini and then apply for a withdrawal order increase. The only flag it would set off is if I didn’t pay my taxes and suddenly the government was wondering where this money came from. Which I would not do. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:32:02
That is what drives the price up. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:53:05

All he had to do was open his mouth. Peters moves are closely guarded and he’s extremely well respected. A lot of people want to ride his coat tails. Interestingly enough he laid out his thinking for this investment on the Tim Ferris podcast back in 2016. Basically he said he thought the other VC firms would not do as well by investing in companies surrounding bitcoin, and would do better investing in the coin itself. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:42:07
I make around 150k a year 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:27:34
Just don’t put money in lol there was no way to keep the ponzi going 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:10:55
Right?! Lol trust me though peoples time horizons in bitcoin are days or weeks. Nobody is thinking in years around here. 2 years in crypto is like 20 years in traditional markets.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:49:15
Lol this is how all these shitty Instagram stars do it. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:56:56
That would suck balls, but honestly I’d be more sad about the failure of the project. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:00:15
It’s a wrap for bitconnect. They shut down their Ponzi scheme, closed shop on their subreddit and left the noobs to pick up the pieces. People lost everything. Total shitshow. Funny because it was heavily avoidable. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:13:34
Hal finney very possibly could be satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:08:01
Same. Since this alt mania / fud campaign by roger ver started I’ve been fighting with people all day and night on twitter and Facebook. I’m over it now, the truth will come out. Noobs will get rekt and I will continue to hodl. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:05:25
It’s definitely worth the risk. Imagine my portfolio goes down to 40x returns. I don’t give a fuck, I’ve been here since people were laughing at me for buying at $200. 40x seemed like a dream then. I told myself I would hodl for 20 years when I got into this game, and that’s exactly what I plan to do. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:24:48
That’s considered very cheap historically in the US
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:46:33
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:29:45
Lol now that I’m richer I can allow a larger cash allocation 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:28:20
Short answer: kinda. Long answer: it’s going to be a bumpy ride before we arrive at that future and it will not go how any of us expect it to. My current vision is that bitcoin will be the peg to which all fiat currencies are tied. Governments will always want to print currencies, but with bitcoin we now have a tool to keep them in check and stop them from debasing so frequently. That said we may have political movements that equal “separation of cash and state” in the future. People may come to see bitcoin as a human right in time and they will demand governments stop printing money with dead presidents on it. Whatever happens it will be exciting as hell and I’m on the ride for wherever we end up. So I will not be cashing out, even in a crash. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:50:26
Sold them and took the profits in cash to spread across my stock portfolio 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:34:16

@_date: 2018-01-01 14:31:55
Good advice, but I like to mitigate majority risk as I enter positions. My initial bitcoin investment came from 5k in gambling profits, I invested 4K more of my own money. So total investment of 9k, but really more like 4K. I took 65k in profits off bcash and 14k off bgold. And I’m done trading bitcoin in the Roth where I made 150k on GBTC over the years. Initial investment maybe 17k. So even if BTC went to zero overnight I have a roughly 1000% gain locked in. So my worst case scenario is I end up 28 years old with a 400k net worth, which is far above most people my age. That money invested in the markets will become 25million by retirement. Or... I have the option to continue hodling bitcoin and be worth 40million by the time I’m 35. Believe me, I’ve been in since late 2014 and there’s never been a better time to be in bitcoin. We’re going to see some serious fireworks in 2018 all the way til mid 2019. Then we will probably blow off quite a bit of steam before the halving in 2020. The other years of hodling felt scary and insecure, this feels like destiny. Do what you want, but I won’t be giving up any of these coins until people are willing to trade me massive amounts of productive land for them. And even then... 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:31:36
She was trying to say the price will double or be roughly 30k. Why she said it in the most convoluted way possible is a mystery to me.

“Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated” -bitcoin
I have the same plan/goal friend. My portfolio lost 300k in the last month, but even after that hit, I’m still up 750k for the year. It’s important to maintain long time horizons. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:34:36
Exactly. I’ve heard it all. There would have to be a protocol level hack or a 51% attack for me to question the project at this point.

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:45:21
Disagree. The parameters and the variables matter. The way in which we build the future matters greatly. Bcash? It’s not the future. Just the past centralization of control we’ve had for so long. The details matter here. The revolution is coming, but like the founding of America. There will be many years of fighting, we can not concede. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:15:19
Let me ask you a question since you are a fan of inflation and QE for some strange reason. What backs fiat currency?
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:00:03
Alts should be used for profit seeking motives only. Do not hodl alts for too long.

Gemini is superior to Coinbase anyway. And surprisingly the winkelvoss twins are good guys who hodl and who get the vision. Weird that they’re heroes in our story. Who would have known lol

My dad used to work for an old billionaire. Old school guy, southern money. In 1999 they were at Augusta, playing a round of golf with some clients. After the round they overheard some young dotcom millionaire bragging about his net worth. My dads boss grabbed a stack of cards, tapped him on the shoulder and said “I’ll cut you for it”... “cut me for what?”... “your net worth, high card wins”. *crickets* The point he was making? Act like you’ve been here before.
