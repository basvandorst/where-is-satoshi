Got it backwards. People can only take your money if you buy. When you sell something you get paid at the cost of bitcoins, stock, carrots, even time. Money is perhaps the only thing which can't be "sold".

Only with the exception that those things are rather valuable compared to a shirt with bitcoin logo, drawing entirely different type of attention when shown off.

Why not take a contrarian stance and do it the other way around? Sell when it hits 50k buy back at 150k and when we're at 300k you are twice as rich, with 400k, 500k and so on in the horizon! I mean who cares when you sell if buying = $$$ regardless, right?

Those 100 people probably aren't holding any significant amounts of bitcoin though, which other clever people have already figured out too. They go for your wallet yes, but not in a "your wallet or your life, now!" manner lol.

Hedging with alt(s) and tether is likely to be at least one of them. Even if I just wanted to hodl I would put some percentage of the BTC up for active trading for the purpose, because the saying cash is kind applies here too. There would always be the risk of theft but it would only affect a portion of total profit, assuming the percentage of BTC in hold and BTC being used is right, the risk:reward ratio favors doing so. Also gives you a chance to dump a portion fast if for some reason sudden need to do so arises without having to wait for confirmations.
Then again god knows what is happening behind the scenes OTC where the biggest players operate anyway. Anybody who actually has sizeable portion isn't stupid enough to announce their strategy keeping safe nor their buying patterns on Reddit for christ sake.

Well fair enough I suppose, though through this assumption could also be said that he had already given the money away when he bought just as well. Which I view as a matter of getting back a different amount (either more or less) when he eventually decides to sell instead of someone taking any money which I'd argue to be already given :P

It puzzles me how the ATMs are allowed to operate under such circumstances without shutting down their operators.

Now this is perhaps the most radical approach on how to use them bitcoins I have seen since the inception, mainstream approach being selling for profit. I'm not so sure about the peace of mind there though, I'd rather go for ability to liquidate as desired along with the risk of making decisions I may or may not regret in the future. Removing ability to make decisions for xxx amount of time in the future doesn't guarantee you won't regret having put the time lock eventually though.
Awesome seeing all these things people are coming up with.
EDIT: I mean, no third-party required, you still arguably own them despite not being able to use them, since you possess the script to redeem them. In theory protecting you from theft due to some unforeseen bug exploited with bitcoin itself, assuming the lock is secure?
