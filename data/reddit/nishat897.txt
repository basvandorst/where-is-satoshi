One more thing, does one report how much they have invested in?
Such as $200 in LTC, ETH, and also in BTC
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:55:56
Would I️ need to put on my taxes if I️ only gained $167?
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:42:28
So does coinbase? Changelly is too much fees
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:53:19
How do they know about me 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:49:29
I heard coinbase is releasing info if you do more than $20k in purchases. I really appreciate this information it helped tremendously, but I have one question   
Would this impact anything? For example, reviewing free healthcare in New York and income tax refunds? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:03:19
Well, It goes off my tax return and how much I made from that year. 
My main issue is my income tax refund. I really don’t wanna see a drop for my family

Get this to Number one
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:51:03
Please let me know once you find the answer!
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:44:29
I heard it’s bad to store it on the platform
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:43:09
Thank you, everyone for your help! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:35:19
How would one go about this if they earn $18k a year with $10k refund? Is it really required on a small amount?
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:16:50
why changelly?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:22:05
