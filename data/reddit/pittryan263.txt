What frequency is your recurring buy?  In the meantime, you should just double that frequency (say from 1 week to 2 weeks) and put in $50 instead of $25 (or 2x as much as before).  It certainly isn't optimal and won't cost average as well, but it's better than not putting any money in at all.

It will probably work for the time being, but the higher BTC goes, the less frequent your buys will be and your cost averaging resolution will become less and less.  
Maybe I'll email Coinbase when they're not soo busy and see if they can add a custom time frame field for recurring buys so I can buy every 11 days or every 13 days etc..  In the meantime, I'll be waiting for them to respond to me over my "high risk" buy and hopefully honor my payment.

I got the same exact email.  I emailed Rees again, asking if there is anyway I can prove my trustworthiness through other forms of identification and expressed my dissatisfaction with the system and how hesitant I am to recommend anyone to use their services.  I haven't badmouthed them in any way, and hope to see my issue resolved, but I am extremely dissatisfied more and more each day.  
And you're right, the (seemingly) selectivity of others getting their purchases reinstated definitely adds insult to injury. 
I also messaged earlier and had no response.  Please Olaf or Rees, help us out so that we can continue to trust and use your companies services.
EDIT: I suck at links

I'm going to visit my friend in Philly for a few days.  I'm coming from Cleveland and thinking of making a 40 mile detour just to get some bitsubs.  It will save me ~$9 in tolls but 40 extra miles and 40 extra minutes of driving.  I'll probably do it anyways!
