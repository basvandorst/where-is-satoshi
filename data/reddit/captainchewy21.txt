Futures aren't just for shorting while it may seem that way. Wall Street is in control of the price of bitcoin right now, it's being heavily suppressed until everything is ready and put in place. CBOE/CME futures gave them the opportunity to short BTC and crash it making a fortune. There is nowhere left for them to make money besides running it up from here. They won't let that happen until everything is online though. Bakkt, ICE &amp; Nasdaq are all launching Q1 2019, not to mention the ETF deadline in Feb. From then I believe we will see a massive bull run as Wall Street takes a long position. It's the classic crash &amp; slingshot, just rinse and repeat. Banksters get rich and the public pays the price. 
But to answer the main question, Bakkt will settle futures with physical delivery of BTC. This is a huge deal.

Wall Street is about to fully embrace BTC, pretty obvious from just the futures side. Not to mention all the institutional custodians and trading services being launched behind the scenes. But Jamie Dimon said bitcoin is a fraud! Meanwhile, J.P Morgan buys as much as it can... give me a break.

Wall street manipulating the price. ICE &amp; NASDAQ are preparing for a full-scale launch 2019 Q1 and not to mention the ETF deadline in Feb. Once the bankers are in they will run it up to the moon... but not yet my son.

For sure. However, the SEC hasn't denied it yet and has only pushed it back. This shows that it hasn't lined up with wall streets timeline. The February date is right around when Wall Street is coming online to embrace Bitcoin, so if there was a time to be approved it would be then. Higher chances than the previous times is all.
