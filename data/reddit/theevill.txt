first of all. Bitcoin is not dot com. that only should warn people away from installing this wallet.

From what I see now, we just passed 5th test of 5800-6000 usd support level. This is not what reversal pattern usually looks like. Especially on something that precious and scarce like Bitcoin. In fact we never seen something like it. 
I am expecting one more dip below above mentioned support, or better-say panic-dip, maybe it will be 4k or even 3k, and be sure, you will get the moment: every mainstream media outlet will spitting doom on all crypto ("...is dead", ".... is forbidden completely in ....", and so on). That will be true bottom. After it, the moon(I like to think that moon is 385000 usd) will seem like next door.

the title is heavily misleading. it's not Russian Money, in fact, it is money stolen from people of Russia by corrupt officials.  
However it might be an opportunity to educate those fat stinky scumbags about Bitcoin, than not only Moon, but Mars or even Jupiter will be possible.

" A year later, on December 6, 2017, Slovenian\-based mining company \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* got robbed out of 4700 bitcoins worth $80 million, and a year after that, on January 26, 2018,  "
made me giggle. if the year is from 6 december to 28 january I would be err.... over 100 y old! yay!

Well, you have access to the netz, maybe abundant drinking water, hot water in your apartment, you got at least middle education, speak 2 languages at least, have something to eat tommorow? you already make it in 5%. 
If you're in Bitcoin for being in x.x% of something you really missing the point....

the very word "banksters" exists for a reason, and it's just one of many
@_date: 2018-06-05 16:52:29
Okay, high fives for that!
now lets get real, we, as merchants need to make prices in bitcoin regardless of fiat prices. How many are ready for that? ofc, we have to give some discount now to encourage usage of bitcoin, and we have to keep those prices for a prolonged period of time, say half a year. During that time we need sufficient funds to maintain business running, since we have to pay our expenses in fiat. 
And when the initial pricing period is over, we need to keep that cycle of fixed pricing until every incumbent in every niche starts accepting bitcoin. Until we finally hit the point of no return \- when vast majority will prefer bitcoin over fiat, but that is a very long road, which makes all institutions like central banks useless and obsolete until they transforms themselves to be of a real use to people, instead of robbing them of value.

it's called common sence: keep your information safe. Imagine building a fcking palace somewhere in jersey, likelihood of some local thugs give you a visit is like 100&amp; if no security or whatsoever, but imagine a 3 room flat somewhere in so called elite apartments in Moscow used solely for stockpiling cash: I mean it, cash euro, dollars, some jewelry, total worth of over 1 Trillion Rur.  No one knew about it for quiet a while, except for the owners. Just who gives a flying fck about yet another apartment with some surveillance and security outside. 
And just imagine, all those crazy corrupt russian, chineese or w\\e politicians will sooner or later enter Bitcoin, or Monero, or w/e... Moon will be place on Earth.

Maybe I've missed something, but bitcoin here is to replace all inflationary reserve currencies. Lets flip this chart of global supply nominated in bitcoins. like selling apple stocks for bitcoin in 2010)

Bitcoin is not "currency", i.e. measure of debt. 
Bitcoin is money, i.e. measure of time and energy.

1. that pic is without recent dip. 
2. if we look at it in different timeframes we will see from 3 to 5 tests to the 5800-6000 usd zone.
3. usually multiple support(in this case, can be resistance) tests are followed by breakout, and only after breakout, and some stop-gathering, price starts slowly moving to broken level and eventually trend reverses. And yep, dumping 10k btc on the market can crush it. 
4. stop looking for some magic button, like etf, which will pump Bitcoin to the moon. besides who the hell needs etf, thats not what Bitcoin is about. Adoption and development is what matters. Educate people, contribute to codebase, do w/e suits you. for now I'm amazed how people jumped onto apple/samsung w/e pay, which let's them swipe their NFC-enabled phone to the terminal to pay for 10$ groceries (hello George, you must be spinning in your grave every time they do it). After all, phone is a bit heavier than ordinary rfid card and just an introduction of another middleman in payment chain. We need to make Bitcoin usable for every stupid teenager, or demented elderly people, for now we are light years away from it, or maybe just to-the-moon distance, depends on how fast we will be moving)

I recently was approached by numerous people with one question "how to buy bitcoin", it's not some random people, but those who have many years of real (not internet) business behind them. What I say to them is that they do not need to buy bitcoin right here right now, but invest some time in getting along with the tech behind it, invest some time in self-education,
At least they got the idea, that before they know what pgp is, and how currency differs from money, diving into bitcoin is bit too early.

for the long time, since Nathan R acknowledged words, the power of issuing some entity called  is given to the people, in the very end of all this just tell me, who gonna call the shots: millions and billions of people, or some extremely, unbelievable arrogant, rich ignorants. 
Just keep in mind one thing: without us, i.e. the 99.999% of the world they cannot exist. Time has come. They will try to regulate Bitcoin, as they did long before it, but it's the people who choose to take the risk, to accept, to spread the very idea of it.

I did it AAntop way: to bring new user to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:14:17
after this I must say I just stick to AAntop, this is THE Man, fuck the price predictions. just fuck it. I want to pay with btc not only for my phone/hosting or alike, I want fuck the gov, fuck the banksters, fuck whoever willing to put his dirty hand on funds I transfer without doing anything, just because theres some arbitrary rule or settlement, saying they authorized to: I need wider adoption everywhere. They all try to shrink cash use now, cuz the cash provides some degree of anonymity, and they can't tax it. and those etoro - just keep in mind - another man in the middle, so you guessed it right - screw them.

oh, ye, another clueless kid, who never even knew who the hell Erwin Schrödinger was. The thing is you not only need to generate err, 2\^256 tries, but in fact you need to compare it to something. Now guess what? 1 try / second. 10 consecutive fails - you get cut off  forever. and oh well, you really think it's that simple, just to turn backwards sha256 once? plx plox, get, fcking, real.
