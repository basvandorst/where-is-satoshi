I would say go for it if you will be ok if bitcoin goes to $0 and it's not going to ruin you emotionally or financially.
Bitcoin is, among other things,  a new investment asset that has the potential to go up as well as go down in value.
Let's do a what-if scenario. You have a loan for $35K, can you pay the amount due every month until it's paid off? If you answered anything but yes, then you need to rethink this and what I'm hinting at is if you answered along the lines of "I'm planning to pay it off when bitcoin goes to $20,000 by selling some"...
It's an asymmetric investment, like an investment in a small biotech company that has the potential to succeed and you could double, triple or more the value of your investment, or the biotech company may run out of money and close shop before getting a drug to the market. Either way, you can only lose what you put in, but the rewards may be many times your investment. I say it's a good risk/reward scenario. 
yolo, my friend.

I've used [hotels.com](  gift cards bought from [gyft.com](  gyft is only for US, I believe.  I would recommend  [cheapair.com](   which I've used for hotels and  flights and you don't need gift cards.

If you never hold any bitcoin (or any cryptocurrencies) valued at over $10,000 on any foreign exchange, does it mean there are no FBAR requirements?
[I hold 99.99% of my coins on the blockchain through private keys/local wallets]

I got in 2013, the blockchain was about 15GB, I stored on a USB flashdrive. It wasn't that early for me when I got in was $100 and me not being rich (and was broke), I could only buy (afford to speculate) a couple of thousand $. It went down to $85 and started a bull run to over $1,200 until the bear market kicked in for 2 years. Glad I'm still here, but wish I was not so scared to go all-in at $100, i could have borrowed enough to buy 100 to 200 bitcoins.

Bro, my friend, whatever you do, stop posting here and go somewhere safe, somewhere far. Read 's post above as that should be a wake up call. If you don't think you have resources coz they're in bitcoins, you were a software dev, so the following should be easy for you.
pick the wallet that has the smallest amount of btc. Open an online BTC wallet on counterwallet.io and create an account and create some addresses.  Look for JPJA's xcp sweep paper wallet on github and sweep the private key destination to your counterwallet address(es). now you have an online btc wallet you can use anywhere.
create a new anonymous gmail address on incognito. use that new gmail wallet as login to gyft.com.  There, you can have resources for groceries (WholeFoods, target, walmart) hotels.com (don't stay at motels, stay at hotels, no need for 5 stars but you need a good hotel has good security for you), airlines, uber for transportation. One bitcoin is all you need for a lot of these things. You may need a new phone to use as your gyft wallet app, pick a Nexus or something that has no bloatware, don't pick a cheap Chinese android phone. Heck, buy a new laptop and wipe out windows and install lubuntu. 
I wish you the best, but stay away from here, many eyes are focused on you. Again, read 's post above to see what kind of spot light is on you now. Call your loved ones from far away. Try to get a prepaid phone so no one will hack your account not registered to your name.
