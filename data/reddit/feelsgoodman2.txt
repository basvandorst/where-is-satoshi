I think you actually mistyped that, but thank you anyway for the good sentiment sir!

When I first heard about bitcoin, it was really daunting since I didn't understand the whole crypto currency thing. But then I figured I'd read up more about it here and in other places and it really helped me. People can be really helpful as long as you're willing to learn.

I dunno, but it's pretty cool.

Yeah, this thing really does hop around quite a bit (pun not intended). But it's kind of fun to have to keep tabs on it.

Sorry for being out of the loop, but what does this mean in the long run?
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:25:42
Wow that's amazing, thanks for showing me this.

I could totally imagine a system like this being used for prostitution. I don't know why, I just pictured nefarious uses despite how many good things it could do.

How do you charge people? Does the rate fluctuate with the value of bitcoin?

As someone who's studied Economics, the thing I love about bitcoin is that it truly proves the idea that anything is worth what people are willing to pay for it. I'm interested to see where bitcoin goes from here, I know it's kind of on a downtrend right now.

Damn, I must be getting old. You kids and your nex-gen text books.

Thanks dude. As a general note to anyone reading this, if something seems too good to be true, it almost ALWAYS is.

That tinfoil hat is on strong there. Ultimately, everyone should make educated decisions on how to invest their money, and I doubt these little tip bots are at the forefront of a mass movement of money to scam new people.

You're free to express your opinions, but the fact of the world is that some people will get money for things that you, or I, or people in general see as unfair. I'm much the same way in that I don't typically have much to say on Reddit, but I do think it's cool that some people are generous enough to tip others for commenting.

Well, I'm pretty new so I can't really give you too much solid advice. But, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:02:45
Sorry if that was a dumb question on my part, I still have yet to actually see a place where you can pay with it.

Careful though, sometimes you just buy into something that truly is just crashing. There's survivorship bias in a lot of this stuff.

Woo! Thanks for this.
