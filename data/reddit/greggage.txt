The other guy didn’t answer your very easy question. If you believe the price will go down and want to bet against bitcoin that is your business and I wish you the best. Be very careful with leverage. Good luck.
I like using kraken to short as they are US based. Other exchanges such as bitfinex and bitmex allow this but I would be careful. Bitfinex has stolen funds from users before to cover their ass from stolen funds. This is highly illegal for any US based company to do and funds from US exchanges have never been stolen. 
You sell for more than you have and therefore have a negative position. Only exchanges with margin allow for shorting.

Coinbase and coinbase pro do not have leverage trading. I hope they introduce it at some point in the future.Personally I ACH transfer fiat to coinbase and use low leverage on Kraken.  
I definitely think US based exchanges are the way to go if you are going to keep your coins on an exchange.

Anywhere around \~6k give or take a few hundred has been a good dip. First \~6k dip was in February. Multiple exit and entry points since then.Not saying it won't go down further but if you bought at that range there were multiple entry points and profit taking opportunities.  
There were a lot of signs early 2018 that the 6k level would be strong support. So I don't think it's just a hindsight game.
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:03:35
Is this a thing? People invest based off sports emotions?
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:52:23
My case for either:  
Bull: This is near the end of the fulcrum bottom and we will be attempting to break 10k and see a confirmed bull run at \~12k. Going back to 6k would not invalidate this theory as long as we don't make a 5th wave down.  
Bear: Bitcoin is making higher lows, 15% each time. Hence why it fought so hard at 7120-7140 levels being 15 percent off of the 8400 levels.
If it can't breach and hold above 7250 I'm bearish we will see 6k again. 5.5k-6k support is very strong but who knows there could hypothetically be a 5th wave down. Which means another opportunity to buy cheap discount. 2014 had 5 ways down.
I'm long term bullish, and believe in bitcoin.I'd keep an eye out in the next few days for CME futures expiration.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:55:12
It's hard to find an argument saying that Bitmex is good for the market. Leverage and margin trading is part of any market, but such high leverage gives way to easy market manipulation.
@_date: 2018-08-07 16:26:00
The people behind both ETFs are wildly different, which experts say there is no difference?  
The winklevoss ETF was never going to be passed, they *just didn’t have the safeguards in place. As well, they didn’t have the connections or the background that the Securities and Exchange Commission could trust.*  
The CBOE ETF on the other hand is the largest U.S. options exchange and has a golden reputation in the industry.   
CBOE can be trusted with custody, since that IS what they do. Regulators are not going to risk their jobs letting the winklevoss twins take custody of multi billion dollars worth of assets. The winklevoss guys don't have the connections or trust of the regulators. CBOE does.   
Sorry for the rant. Very likely the CBOE ETF will be pushed back, but I am hopeful it passes.

We are certainly in uncharted territory. 
But bitcoin is not a trillion dollar industry. Institutional custodial products, ETF, physical future delivery, etc are not in place yet so until that happens we will stay Wild West. 
The only big difference now regulators are starting to go after ICOs.   
Bitcoin is deemed a commodity so it'll be handled by the CFTC not the SEC. Unless you are money laundering, shouldn't be any changes with Bitcoin as far as regulation (Maybe offshore/sketchy exchanges/DEXs).

Wasn't talking about you specifically. I'm talking about when steve jobs was mass selling his shares and everyone got scared out.
People got scared out of Amazon along with most tech stocks in the dot com crisis and it was a wealth transfer to institutional money as they bought it up in crisis. Retail sold because percent change of their positions.

So you don't like to buy when the prices are low?
Don't be the guy who shorts the low and longs the top. 
There is a price in which we think things are well priced at. 
For BTC in 2018, 6k was a good buying level. 5k was more of a dream we all talked about wanting to get in on. 
I did. Leveraged 4.5x at 4900.

@_date: 2018-11-14 20:58:53
Percentage of salary is not a good way to go IMO. Think about your take home pay and your burn.
Out of your disposable income, after all costs, find an acceptable level of exposure to put aside for stores of value.
Best thing I ever did was have dollars saved up on hand for opportunities where everyone is panicking in any sector I watch and get some more exposure. 
If we are using Bitcoin as a long term store of value, layer in and don't use dollars that are going to be used for living costs.
Hopefully you aren't too overexposed. Consider a building a war chest to buy when there is blood in the streets.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:42:40
I'm at risk at getting closed out around 3.8k, and I have some cash on the side. Because I'm not trading on bitmex, I don't have to worry about losing the whole stash and am free to re enter with the \~60% remaining plus whatever else I scrounge together.
If we do get down to the 2k levels, yeah I won't have anything to trade with. I don't see a retracement that far.
There were some $1,000 green candles that were around 15% or so this year. 
I wouldn't consider it unreasonable to see at large move up ($600+).

Bakkt allows an on and off ramp for those who want to buy and sell cryptocurrency through a custodian. If Goldman, Fidelity, Northern Trust (all stating they will be crypto custodians for their clients), they can buy it from Bakkt and take the daily futures delivery to one of the custodians without physically touching the hands of the client.
One of the issue with large money is they either don't want to or can't take custody of their assets.
Precious metals are a good example of this.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:19:04
I'm not saying next, as there may/probably will be moves before then.
But yeah we should see something Dec 19th.
Another thing to note for futures is Bakkt is announced to start on December 12th.
Bakkt is daily futures delivery with physical bitcoin not paper like we have right now with CME/CBOE.
So that could be a game changer in either direction. Not sure how or if daily futures changes volatility on CME/CBOE futures expiration days.   
Personally I think it could create an interesting bitcoin supply dynamic.
We should be in for an interesting ride the next couple months.
Personally I'm staying on the long side of things and bought this dip.

Trade volume for the past 24 hours is extremely high. Highest we've seen in the past 6 months. 
Coinbase is pushing 60,000 BTC volume. I'm sure other exchanges are seeing more volume than usual.

@_date: 2018-11-20 21:31:49
The whole thing about the low is you won't know what it is until retrospect. 4040 could be that low, but we won't know until later. 
Because I can't time the market, I can wait or DCA and layer in. My preferred method is DCA and layering. 
Otherwise I can wait for the dust to settle and likely miss the opportunity to capture the low. We've seen enough huge large buys, a few green $1000 moves this year.

I'd make the statement that it's no different than in 2014-2015 bear market. If you look at the top 10 list back then, most are not around today. 
Not sure what the future holds for people have been playing with alts for years and it hasn't led to the demise of bitcoin. 
I wouldn't say it's good for bitcoin but BTC dominance has been &gt;50% for a few months now.

Much like many of you, we have been watching BTC for most of this year. 
Always funny business on CME and CBOE futures expirations. 
CBOE futures expire today. Either manipulation, wealth transfer, call it whatever you want.
I think now is a good time to buy based off price levels.
Looks like the selling is done. If I'm wrong feel free to shame me after this all shakes out.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:59:46
BCH fork not BTC fork. As for the crash it looks like three things.
1: I can't say I'm a strong believer in charting, but BCH had a big H&amp;S pattern. from the start of November. Easier to see in retrospect of course.
2: CBOE futures expiration happened today. CME and CBOE futures in 2018 has always had high volatility on expiration days. Speculative on how long that will continue after daily physical delivery of futures with BAKKT as the cryptocurrency space changes.
3: A lot of extremely wealthy coin holders are fighting amongst each other, and the average joe gets stopped out or scared out.
The contrarian in me would say it's a good buy around these price levels especially with an imminent hard fork, but I can't speak to the validity of the underlying asset.
If you believe in it dollar cost average in to catch the low range, if not it'll be fun to see what happens in the next couple weeks.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:38:21
A lot of the big Bcash people have a lot of Bitcoin as well.
There's a lot of funny business going on with people who have a whole lot of coins.
For good or bad on price, that should continue in the next few months.
Possibly some new big money entering in the next couple months with new custodians and Bakkt as an on and off ramp to USD.
Good luck to all.

Sure but bitcoin is deemed a commodity by regulators. 
No commodities pay dividends, and that's okay. Many people and institutions invest in commodities and shouldn't be dismissed. If you do, it shows heavy bias. 
It's never smart to dismiss an entire asset class.

I have that opinion about a good chunk of ICOs. I don't like the lack of investor protection and accountability.
I know BTC will be around for a very long time.
I own a couple coins that aren't bitcoin but I treat them as something that has a decent probability of going to 0.
I finally had the stones to buy some ETH around 210 after watching it all of 2018.
I bought a little BCH at $430 as a short term gamble. I'll probably take out 50% of both BCH and the fork when I find the price to be overbought and put it into ETH and ride the rest to parabolic levels or to 0.
I find BCH to be one of the most speculative projects based on the team. I can't say I'm a believer.
Always thought it was trash as well, but I'll buy garbage for the right price and small position size.

We are all in this for the long term store of wealth. The guys that have been here long enough have the proof.

Late 2020 is quite a ways out for an emerging market. I think that may just be momentum opinion. Being absolutely bearish on an incredibly beaten up asset class that moves.   
Saying BTC will only hit 5k in two years is a very wild statement for a volatile market.
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:22:22
I think you're being overly bearish after a large stretch down no different to those overly bullish at 15k. Maybe it has more room, but price level is low.   
We've seen these 70-85% downside moves before don't pretend like we haven't done it and recovered every single time. 
I've been personally saying buy up to price is 6.8k. 
If you don't have any interest in the asset class, you can find your way to the door. Bitcoin is currently beaten up plenty, if you think we are going back to triple digits you are smoking the opposite of hopium. 
Don't be the guy who longs the tops and shorts the bottoms. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:11:35
Except bitcoin is divisible and the whole 1 bitcoin situation isn't like buying a share of a company. You're right, it's harder to convince someone to invest 20k to buy a whole bitcoin. But that's almost never the situation. People are going to invest let's say $1,000 if the price is $1,000 or 3,200 or 5,500 or 11,000. 
At this point hypothetically if we recovered to $10k we'd see more people coming in than if it went lower.
I think the vast majority of people buy and sell into momentum regardless of price. 
I'm a value investor so price levels are important to me so I like to buy things that are beaten to shit that I think will be around in a few years but very few people like DCA and seeing red for a while

Well we know we've seen similar &gt;80% drops after making new ATHs. This is what, the 3rd or 4th time BTC has done these similar movements. 
So I'd say no, it would not be difficult/impossible to repeat, as it has done it before. Right?
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:52:56
80% in a calendar year for a specific stock is Great recession I understand that. 
However, if you look at most companies, we've seen a 30-60% drop since October 3rd of this year. 
Both the great recession and this dip don't really take out big companies and are generally a buying opportunity as opposed to the end of the world. However, yes it does take out a lot of people in the process. 
A 2.5% dividend is a nice little present, but not to be confused as nearly as valuable as the underlying asset. It's mostly to give investors some cash flow and the dividend usually comes out of the value of the company in a lot of cases.   
Shit, cryptocurrencies like NEO pay out a dividend in GAS but that doesn't make it game-changing.   
The problem with Venezuelan bolivar is I don't believe in the underlying asset. A change of control would likely lead to a new currency. Cryptocurrency I do believe in the speculative asset. To give you another example, If the Singapore dollar crashed tomorrow by 90% I would buy into it, yes. 
You're saying the asset class will never be anything more than a very very small retail speculative commodity. I understand but disagree
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:46:45
Precious metals are a speculative asset that is primarily used as a store of value. Only in recent years have things like gold had industrial uses (and even then it's still low 10%s that are actually used). You have people at the top of every gold cycle trying to get rich quick.
You get people at the top of every stock cycle trying to get rich quick.
These things aren't new. Nothing in this market is new. That doesn't detract from the asset, much like gold. There's no good reason one small ounce of gold should cost $1200 but it does. And people buy it just as much as they did when it was trading for 270 bucks 18 years ago. Gold bubbled at $1900 in 2011, and I'm sure it'll eventually go back above it's ATH.
Precious metals like gold and silver have made similar huge retracements  just like cryptocurrency. Shit, just look at silver it's almost more volatile than bitcoin. They are still fine stores of values, just depends when you get in and out.
Or take a loot at the S&amp;P crashes, shit that's not a stable store of value either and has also made crazy 60% retracements in the past.
I know this is the internet and I'm not likely to change your opinion.Pump-n-dump is not some new design, and it doesn't mean the underlying asset is shit.Crypto has some revolutionary use cases and technology, but man this is no different than any other market, especially emerging markets.
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:07:10
Gold use in electronic devices has been a NEW event and still represents a small percentage of use cases. 
It has been used as money throughout human existence and only recently has been used for industrial uses, so I don't like the gold industrial argument as it was a store of value in the 20th century without it.
Bitcoin is more rare than gold and the most fungible so the reasons people like gold transfer very well for bitcoin.

Depends when you bought in and what your DCA is. Some could say the same for the equities market, but unless you are predicting a financial crisis soon we all know that equities/commodities are the way to play things now, and BTC is a commodity.

Pace of adoption and pace of innovation are the two big ones. If you are bearish on both, you're bearish on the asset. 
I'd be with you except people have been losing their ass in stocks for decades and they continue to buy back into it not at the lows, but once the water is "warm again" a few years later.   
With that logic, we'd need to see some smart money coming in the next couple months to warm the water back up for retail to come back in. 
People buy silver at $40, not at $14. It's the nature of markets. Doesn't matter which asset. Buy high sell low that's the retail way.

I think we see bitcoin different. I see it as a speculative commodity that is primarily a store of value. Digital gold, if you will. That is how the US regulators see it and categorize it, as a commodity.   
Being a competitor as a payment method against Paypal/Venmo/Visa is secondary. 
It has most if not all of the functions of precious metals with some obvious advantages. Or else we'd be buying into a stablecoin, which is not what we are here for. We are here for an asset that is not correlated with the rest of the markets, something that governments can't easily control. Which is all more store of value than payments. Yes I want to be able to spend it, as we all do, but the core is really the store of value. Or else I should just charge up my venmo account. 
Hypothetically, having some sort of bitcoin debit card that is accepted like Visa would solve the issue so we wouldn't need individual businesses to start agreeing to accept it it and merchants can on their end immediately receive it as local currency. Again, pace of innovation is part of what I'm buying into to supplement the speculative store of value.
I don't think bitcoin being 300 or 50,000 is really a large deterrent, it's a psychological barrier. Like I said earlier, the price going up at this point should increase adoption more than it going down. It doesn't change anything, nor does it change the potential upside depending on where we are with innovation. 
When bitcoin went from $1200 down to the low $200s I'm sure there were people in the same situation as you saying we need to see a return down to the two figure range to get more adoption and the risk/reward ratio yada yada. 
I don't mean to be condescending I see where you are getting at I just don't buy it.
We can't get significantly more adoption in the future and have prices go down to 3 figures. That's just not going to happen.

Not in this space my friend, 10 years of history has shown us that. 
To say things will flatline is quite a statement.
