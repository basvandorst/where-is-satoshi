Lol you actually took the time to write this out? Wow I feel bad for you dude, you must not have any free bitcoin money.

The way I see it we are in for a win-win. Either (1) BITCOIN TO THE MOON, or (2) we get mother fucking quantum processors.
Sign me up.

But IF quantum processors were ever created, blockchain technology would become obsolete? 
If so, that's a discouraging proposition. 
Nonetheless, HODL!!!

The oil/farm contracts you two reference are mostly also cash settled. The oil purchaser/farmer then purchase the oil/wheat at market price regardless of the outcome of their future contract. 
If the option price was 1k and market price is now 800. You will obviously not use your option, so you just lose your premium and buy the wheat at the cheaper market price.
Alternatively, if you made a good bet, and the market price is 1.5k, then you'd still buy the wheat at market, but in this case you'd also get the difference bet went he market price and the option price in cash (minus the premium paid for the option).

You know how long people have been saying "sell soon."
House money is free money. I'd rather lose every cent of profit I've ever made in crypto than to "sell soon." If it's going to crash then so be it, I'm going down with the ship and I'll be none the worse for it. HODL!
