some of altcoins are better than bitcoin in many ways tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:31:47
wallet for btc

Hey, i think about 4 or 5 different coins, and theres no limit of coin amount u store :D i suggest electrum with ledger tho for bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:41:11
holy fucking shit , you used 2$ fees on 15k payment? if you are using electrum you can right click the payment and increase fees which i highly suggest . this can take weeks if not months to confirm since of the low payment fees you sent :D
(did i misread or something , it says 2$ fees but 50 sat / b ? my bad if i did)

not trying to be a dick but shapeshift.io's reddit is full of controversy ,it looks suspicios alot of ppl are unable to get their money 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:39:42
no worries, i just tell people about the reddit thing cause i checked it before buying, im not trying to ruin business or anything just telling people to be careful based on what i seen :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:43:36
i meant are you using ledgerwallet or electrum?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:35:22
its just the beginning :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:22:08
reporting someones steam doesnt do jackshit, sorry to say that but its truth. also you never should go first online unless the person is proved trusted
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:44:58
damn ,i have no experience with that wallet , i been using electrum with ledger i find it  better sorry
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:37:43
hey, i suggest as wallet electrum, and even better is to use ledger nano s with electrum (hardware wallet makes it alot safer)
