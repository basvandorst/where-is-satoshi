I have never had any issue. Has it happened before? No. 
Pack your theories together. Bcore is unreliable. I have just shown you the proof and it's a fact. You are just presenting theories.

They have a help page here. 
Choose Bitpay Payment. Describe the issue. Shouldn't take that long time.
@_date: 2019-09-09 10:58:43
They do offer support. Right here:

It's not cherry picking. 
166KB is the general block size. There are blocks over and below that size but if you take the sizes of the blocks in the last 24 hours and divide it by number, then you get that size.
Bitcoin Cash is accepted in a lot of the places where crypto is accepted so I'm totally fine with it.
And smaller blocks is a good thing, right? You flighted with tooth and nail to keep the 1MB limit so you seem to prefer smaller blocks. Or no?

It was two miners. Some miner tried to take coins sent to Segwit addresses but these two miners protected the chain and gave it back to the original owners. They protected the chain - they didn't attack it.

I received funds and then the app stopped working. And yes it does.
Do you have a txid as an example because to be honest I really don't believe you. When the mempool fills you can easily pay more than a dollar.
Hm okay. Do you have any proof that they are funding a spam attack or is it just a conspiracy theory?
Personally I'm more positive about other projects but I'm open to LN too so definitely I'll try it again.

It doesn't make sense that just because bitcoin is used then it's a spam attack by an organization you don't like. I could also say that Donald Trump is spamming the network but that doesn't make it true just because I say it. I think you should take a break from your thinking, so you don't make up weird theories. 
I have done so many times. If the fee has to be one dollar and I set it to a few cents it hangs in the mempool like forever.

There are users buying the native currency of all the forks. Otherwise they wouldn't exist
@_date: 2019-09-14 09:51:48
As I said it was two miners. Not one person.
Bitcoin is secure as long as the majority hash is controlled by honest miners. That applies to BTC, BCH, BSV - whatever fork you pick.
@_date: 2019-09-09 10:53:42
What did their support say?
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:25:08
I'm talking about the way Bitcoin was designed and this counts for forks two. The BCH community doesn't have one person in charge. As you say all participate in consensus. If a miner produces a block "the customer" (the user) needs to accept it. If the miners want to change the rules, but the user doesn't value it more than the original rules, they will become a minority fork. That's how BTC split into BTC and BCH and the same reason BCH later split into BCH and BSV. These same principles still apply, no matter which chain. We have seen that play out multiple times now, so there shouldn't really be any doubt that this is how it works.
@_date: 2019-09-18 09:32:47
I see.
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:41:03
Currently generally 166.54 KB blocks for BCH and 604.92 KB for BSV.

Have a look at the cheapest transaction in block 594513: 
The fee is 15 cents, not 2 cents. Stop lying Mr.
Ah I see, now you change the topic to avoid the truth. Fun. As a reminder we were talking about the reliability of the payment network - not trading.
@_date: 2019-09-09 10:51:27
Because of the on chain high fees, I guess.
@_date: 2019-09-12 08:50:33
There is no false narrative about high fees. The fees are high. Not 2 cents as you say - only if you're lucky and times with very low demand. If you say otherwise, you are simply lying - simple as that. 
I would rather say that the banksters won by infiltrating the community and reversing adoption. The so-called users are hired trolls. The people who are left in the BTC community is trolls and ignorant moon bois. 
This is true because I say it. If you can't see it it's because you can't but 2 and 2 together.
@_date: 2019-09-13 09:55:43
It's not about the transaction - it's about reliability. This is the same for all transactions. You said that it's two cents all the time so I found one to prove to you that what you are saying is false. It's NOT all the time. 
Bitcoin cash is good for transactions. And maybe good for IQ test too. Well I have a higher IQ than you then.
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:56:30
No. There are user nodes too my dear friend - you also just said that yourself so don't change your mind that quickly. This is no different from BTC. In the end the customer decides. If he/she doesn't want to buy the product, there's no business. This is very simple to understand.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:20:05
It must also be fees sometimes. For me it is. The fees are not 3 cents all the time. Sometimes they are 1 dollar or above which can be a lot for small value transactions. And yeah instant transactions are awesome. Personally I don't feel very comfortable with LN at the moment because I already lost some funds with it so I'm a bit careful.
