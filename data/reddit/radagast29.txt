Somebody posted a spreadsheet containing results from a Bitcoin questionnaire recently - it had 1,000 responses.  That's probably a relatively good guide of how much BTC the early adopters hold.
Find out where you rank on that list, and then if you're in the top 1,000, you're definitely part of the elite.

Yeah, he's working at Ripple isn't he?  I already did a bit of research on him.
Amagi does sound good.  I don't know why I didn't properly research Coinabul before I ordered.  I remember doing a few Google searches and not finding anything bad.  That's going to change! :P

Damn it, I actually checked the periodic table to see if you were correct.

I'm sure if they saw my hacky attempts at PHP code they'd take all those Ripples back.

Another ego-fuelled, narrow-minded brogrammer.  Thank god there are some nice approachable developers out there who don't get their knickers in a twist as easily.

Same for me.  Apparently I did the same thing in May and Bitstamp sent it right back then too.
What's up with ripple.com anyway?  It logs you out when you refresh, pages don't load properly, and when you try and convert to another currency it hangs.

Oh no, it was a google docs spreadsheet.  Amounts ranged from like .5 to 30k.
Sorry, it was on reddit about two weeks ago, can't find it.  I'm a web developer which means I don't have a browser cache.

I don't think CompanyCheck reveals much information about potential Slovenian bank bail-ins, which is the biggest worry regarding Bitstamp right now.
You may be able to get some interesting information, but I doubt everything is done through their UK subsidiary.

Needs more volume.
