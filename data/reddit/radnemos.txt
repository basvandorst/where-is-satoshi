Yeah I was looking into that. I just found that you can export an address' history to spreadsheet. That was easy.

Here is a video showing it:

Why an arbitrary amount of bitcoin could soon be worth more than an arbitrary amount of gold.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:58:22
This has some amount of truth to it. The miners could accept a change that forever destroys bitcoin's value. This could not happen for gold.

Cells are programmed from birth to do nothing but serve a larger body that doesn't care about them individually, with no choice about what their role will be. They are incapable of surviving on their own and if they try to do their own thing they will be destroyed as a cancer. The cell's role in a body is the most direct form of fascism I could think of. It seems our definitions of freedom are completely opposite, and your "freedom" will inevitably attempt to enslave me.
Money is absolutely necessary for the efficient allocation of scarce resources. Efficient use of resources will be the only concern to a colony on a dangerous planet. The amount of penny-pinching and concern for money on a colony would make you cry.
I'm not opposed to a bunch of your ilk going out and trying to create this self-less society, but I think it is unsustainable and will inevitably require sucking resources out of more productive societies to survive.

The primary implication I'm aware of is that could become a global currency that can't be inflated or controlled by institutions.
I don't know any specific reads, but I'm sure you could google to find something.

If you say things that are false, and I try to correct you, am I battling with you? Not everything is a two-sided coin. Sometimes someone's perspective is just layers and layers of misconceptions and wishful thinking.

Yeah, this is pure, delusional, communism. A peaceful, prosperous society is not built by people "doing what they love". It's built by people working extremely hard to produce something that others want and being rewarded for that hard work. You are assuming that all people will someday learn to totally trust each other, and that there won't be people who take advantage of other's generosity. If we don't "keep score", producers will be scammed and cheated and left with nothing.
Dollar values are not arbitrary, they reflect the relative scarcity and demand of resources. There will never be such a thing as post-scarcity.
Humans are both cooperative and competitive in nature. The competition is what makes us strive for greater things. Your fantasy society will never exist without an authoritarian regime to enforce it, which will result in the death and suffering of millions.

What happens in some alternate universe that you will never interact with is irrelevant. According to this theory, there is a certainty that an intergalactic spaceship will materialize in my back yard today in some alternate universe. The probability of this happening to me, personally, is practically zero. I'm not going to plan my future based on this happening.
You really are just saying, "Everyone should believe whatever they want, because anything is possible." This is not being a realist. A realist would recognize that our universe is based on cause and effect, and limited resources. And they would recognize that humans have a tribal and competitive nature that can only be extinguished by totalitarian oppression.
Evolution increases fitness because the unfit are unable to survive. Society's that refuse to use a money system will always die off, and will certainly never develop advanced space travel.

Yeah, I figured it was futile. I try to get a look at their perspective on my arguments at least, but they just ignore what I say and spew platitudes.

How am I supposed to trade my computer programming labor for a car without a medium of exchange?

Money is not gunk. It is the grease that allows resources to move globally from body to body. Free people produce a free monetary system. State-controlled money is gunked up to serve the state's purpose. Technology "costs money" because it requires effort to produce, and is scarce. Your ideology sounds like communism masked in social justice language. You should read some free-market economics:

I'm expecting them to socially engineer a "network upgrade" that introduces quantitative easing into the bitcoin minting schedule.

Here's the reasoning put forth by a major BCH player:
This is something that should at least be able to be discussed rationally without knee-jerk reactions to demonize.

Doubling the number of bits doesn't make it twice as hard. Going from 128 to 256 bits make it 3.4 x 10^38 times harder.
