Hah. You mean because this sounds like the plot of a Dan Brown book? I've always liked his stories.

I'm coming from a lot of ignorance here but isn't the coin the chain of transactions that are stored in a block? wouldn't you need to count the average size of a block in the bitcoin blockchain and then multiply that by number of bitcoin full nodes in the world?

what do you mean by that?

That's a good point. Security and Trust are not the same thing. However, Bitcoin has a good bit of security too. :)

eloquent and well said. I hope OP caught it.

I don't know. If I was going to create some kind of name for a new currency, I might have used "bitgold" or "digicoin" over Bitcoin. I don't know if there was some lengthy consideration given to the name or not. I still think there is a small possibility that it was a double entendre.

As far as I understand, quantum computing will affect other cryptographic applications so if the concern is that bitcoin security is weak then my question is: weak compared to what?

"Bitcoin security is weak" ok. Bank ledgers need to be locked up in a vault and relies on physical walls for security. Bitcoin can be totally exposed to the entire world and is far more impenetrable.

fuck conspicuous consumption.
