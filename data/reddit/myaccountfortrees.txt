You’re a brave soul relying on $5000US. I think I would spend $3-4000 on learning a trade/education/certification relevant to where I was headed and go from there. That’s just me though. I don’t have much faith in printed paper or shiny rocks. Skills...I do have faith in skills. Skills pays the bills.

Or, around 180 games of golf.

I was about to offer you 60M in BTC, but I felt like that might not be a sufficient overall BTC percentage for you based on your post, and I would hate to disappoint someone by giving them only 60M/small percentage. I’m sorry 60M couldn’t be of more help.

Yes. You mathed.

Can't you just simply remove the drive and it erases all processes and powers down the PC? No holding the power button needed. I've not used it in months though, so things could have changed...(?)

At $10,000 US you have to fill out a tax form (CTR) for deposits or withdraws. If you withdraw cash or purchase with cash, a money order $3000+ (maybe $3000-$5000) you have to fill out another form. If you try to avoid this by doing $9900 US multiple times, it’s is the responsibility of the teller to file a report of suspicion for your obviously trying to avoid the $10,000 US form. 
Edit: CTR for $10K, the MIS is for Money Orders. SAR is the suspicious activity report although I remember it having a different acronym.

Perhaps it was a bank/state (OR) specific thing, but for Money Orders that were $3-5000 in cash, a report was required...pretty sure it was called a MIS report. And as for the reporting for frequent cash handlings close to, but under $10K for the same person, I think it was called a TCMS report if you suspected someone of violating the terms of having an account with that bank (such as avoiding CTRs). It wasn’t required, but encouraged to avoid terrorism activity.
