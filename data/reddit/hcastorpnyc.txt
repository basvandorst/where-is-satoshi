A very skeptical article from Doug Henwood.  Henwood's radio show, Behind The News, is one of the best around on economic and political topics.  The article itself is relatively shallow, unfortunately.  It touches on many of the arguments against Bitcoin without going into much depth about any of them.  
In my personal opinion the biggest question mark for the future of Bitcoin is not regulation or anything internal to the currency but simply what other means of payment it has to compete against. As I see it, bitcoin's value as an asset is ultimately tied to its desirability for making and receiving payments.  There is a lot of innovation in this space recently and I find myself skeptical that bitcoin can really reign supreme for long.

I'd say it depends on what you want to do with it, not your views on economics.

Agreed.  I would project being able to mine between 1.5 and 2 BTC in the next year with one of these.  Considering how easy they are to set up, how cool they are, etc, they would be a steal at $150.

When the people of Cyprus argue for leaving the Euro, they are arguing for control of their own currency. Bitcoin doesn't give local governments control over their own currency.  If Cyprus could control their own currency, they probably would have printed tons of money in response to this crisis, essentially defaulting by way of inflation. Compared to what actually happened, this probably would have been better for natives of Cyprus, but a very, very harsh blow to foreign depositors.  At an individual level, theses people would have been better off holding some of their funds in Bitcoin.  But I don't see how it would have helped the country as a whole.

Their sell price was lagging by quite a bit earlier.  I think they only reacted to this volatility a few minutes ago, they had a tiny spread all the way down to 110 or so and it only opened up after that.

I was thinking along different lines - for example, I'd like to do my earning in deflationary money, and my spending in inflationary money.

What does 'use' mean in your third paragraph?
@_date: 2013-08-22 02:44:46
Why is that desirable?  Isn't ease of use (lower fees and faster transactions) more important than profitability of mining? 
@_date: 2013-05-24 17:39:42
Yeah, I'd put the odds of these actually paying for themselves by mining at maybe 20%.  I think the best chance of making a profit with them would be reselling.

I'm confused.  That site seems to be reporting that the total network hashrate is around 200 Th/s, but bitcoincharts has it at around 140.  
What am I missing?
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:21:12
This is the right way to go about it - by far the most important variable is the rate of growth of the total network hashing power.  I don't think the curent 1% growth rate is really sustainable for a whole year, but it could easily last for the next couple of months in which case the damage will mostly have been done in terms of reducing your return.
According to the rather crude script I wrote, if one assumes growth of 0.5% per day indefinitely, you could make a small profit with this device - but if the growth is even slightly higher, especially in the first few months, you'll never break even.  At 1.5 BTC I might be tempted even though there would still be substantial risk, but 2 BTC (let alone the resale price these things are fetching) is just too high.

There is tremendous irony in the way that in 1900, populist movements sprang up to attack the gold standard, which was at that time the darling of banks and Finance generally, while 100 years later, populists rally around gold.  Whatever the current money paradigm is, elites are going to bend it to their advantage.
@_date: 2013-06-02 01:15:46
Well done.  But there are some odd things.
For instance, in "expert" mode, adjusting the time to delivery of the miner does not affect the "time to break even", which can lead to odd results like a break-even time of 30 days and a negative expected return for 12 months . . .

I don't think that alone would kill Bitcoin. And certainly not directly. My completely uneducated guess is that it would reduce its value by 90-99% instantly which would be a huge blow but not necessarily the end.

Hmm, I almost joined steamboat's group buy (batch 6) but opted not to in the end.  I still think it would likely have been slightly profitable but just not worth the risk/hassle.  What are you planning on doing with your chips?
