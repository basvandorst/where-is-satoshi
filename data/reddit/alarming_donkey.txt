If you start believing in complete nonsense like that you can see "benefits" in anything.

That's what catastrophic climate change sounds like.

You're a strange person.

Idgi, buying bitcoins only furthers the pyramid scheme that enriches a few early adopters and drives all the rest into poverty. To create a fairer and more equal society you need democratic socialism, comrade.

It's a religious technology like Scientology.

Unless they happen to be running a mining cartel of course.

AKA a student. What about the rest of the club members?
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:43:12
Lol owned
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:38:11


By engineers and scientists you of course mean "a handful of clueless students"

In the socialist utopia of the future healthcare is free.

They are not running on renewables. There's one common factor with all the currently hyped bitcoin mining installations, cheap coal.
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:59:36


No but the bitcoin club you linked to does.

There's always hope, our ability to treat mental disorders improves each year.

Oh look, you found another fake "experiment" with no scientific references backing it, and you chose to believe in it anyway.
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:33:09
Have you considered not screaming?
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:26:10
Bitcoin and sovereign citizens, a match made in heaven.

Actually it's up infinity million percent since Satoshi Mined Alone

If you meant "the best guess of those who know history", that would be "SELL SELL SELL"

Ross is a multiple attempted murderer and drug baron, he deserves to be in prison.

If you haven't bought more since you don't believe in bitcoin

That's a link to his own company's website. It's not informative because there's no real analysis or information behind the price claims, he's just another pumper. He's successful because his customers are also clueless.
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:25:25
Tom Lee posted that headline on his own website so he probably agrees with it, but go ahead and keep defending a clueless liar who hoodwinked you.
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:43:45
Sounds like you hate capitalism and the free market OP
@_date: 2018-12-11 08:57:41
Definitely not most.
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:07:26
I guess this is why it took years before they finally sort-of-fixed transaction malleability, a critical security bug.
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:41:09
Redditor at all, not so lol.
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:13:23


Maybe not the best example considering this is not relevant to anyone outside America anymore.
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:03:32
You've bought more since though. What's your DCA now
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:37:49
I guess he shouldn't have linked to that supposedly false headline then, lol
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:25:33
Have you even read the White Paper? Satoshi clearly predicted this, check out the Fibonacci inversions of the letters 'b' and 'c' in paragraph 3 on page 7.
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:24:52


Tom Lee in July 2018: "I want to be clear, bitcoin is going to $25,000 by year end."
He's a clueless liar.

There we go, bitcoin crashing is actually good for bitcoin because the other bitcoin crashed more!!
