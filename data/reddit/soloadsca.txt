It's not manipulation, it's short selling. Making money when it goes up and making money when it goes down...

The humain nature is insane, the Bitcoin price is now under the mining price. It will not stay below 7K for long after testing the February low. My only 2 cents.

I sold my position, waiting for the next drop to buy back. Good luck all.

Bitcoin is very easy to handle for big whales because there is no regulation. So they sell high, then buy low but ... we did not know how low is low for them. For one thing, they will buy back and the price will go up again because it's human nature to try to make easy money. My only 2 cents.
