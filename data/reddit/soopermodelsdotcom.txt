Son, I was using email before you were even swimming in your father's ball sack. 
I won't bother to school you on how fundamentally flawed btc is, seeing that you're a wet-behind-the-ears kid without any real life experiences whatsoever.
Have you even traveled outside of your own state, let alone to a foreign country?  
The Magic 8-Ball says *"Highly Doubtful "* on both counts.
So instead of giving you the schooling you are so lacking, I'll just sit back and laugh at you while I watch the world of btc crumble around you.

*1. a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.*
*"the cult of St. Olaf"*

*"a network of Satan-worshiping cults"*
***3. A misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing.***

I think I can answer that question for you...
It has been reported that the founder of ChangeTip, Nick Sullivan, has been shadowbanned by Reddit for vote brigading.  The founder of a fricking company of all people caught vote brigading.  
How pathetic.
But that's not nearly as pathetic as ***Sullivan caught outright lying*** in a recent NY Times article.  In the article Sullivan lies about how people have tipped "***Over $250,000***", when in actuality that number was ***less than $91,000.***
So now Sullivan has resorted to hiring flunkies like to create Reddit user accounts so they can spam on a daily basis with idiotic threads about the dying company known as ChangeTip.
It goes without saying you can count on a daily spam thread about ChangeTip by someone with little to no other posts other than ones connected to ChangeTip.
These Sullivan flunkies also come out en force as downvote brigaters to downvote any and all comments that don't support ChangeTip's mantra.

Now bring on the downvotes, all of you ChangeTip hired flunkies!

You are absolutely correct.
ChangeTip, for whatever idiotic reason that I can't begin to fathom, has linked the amount of btc's tipped to the value of USD.
To do that is so mind numbingly stupid.
Nick Sullivan is an idiot and the sooner changetip dies its natural death the better.  He has to be low on VC funding by now and his idiotic company has zero means of making any money at all.  
Die, changetip; die!
