pooo yep I made a typo. Well spotted its QT. I am totally confused, to think I used to be quite computer minded and am so out of touch with tech now its unreal. 
I am happy to pay you to help me find these coins. I am worried I am going to lose them for good if I do something wrong.

Hello, thank you for your reply. Yes I fired up the existing version. It is Bitcoin-QC v0.8.6-beta does that help? 
I mined a few bitcoins that were worth nothing back in 2010 or whenever I did it. I just forgot they were there and stopped using the software. I believe my balance was like 3.5BTC as I remember getting a bit excited about it at the time and talking to everyone about it. Yet all I had was negativity and people saying it will never be worth anything. It then just got lost in time.

Hello, where to start here???
When Bitcoin first became a thing I decided to start mining and used Bitcoin QC, downloaded it, set up account, created wallet etc.. I then began mining. Ended up getting about 3 Bitcoins and then got bored. Never thought it would amount to anything and carried on with life.
These were left in my wallet for years. Since all the hype and rise in value of crypto currencies I decided to fire up the old Bitcoin QC software and get my coins out. However I have a message that says my balance is 0.00 BTC and my Wallet is out of Sync.
Do I have to wait for the entire blockchain to download again to re sync my wallet and get the balance back? It is saying that the last block I received was 300weeks ago?? It will take forever to download all that data. I don't understand why my balance of 3BTC is now saying 0.00BTC.
I am worried... Someone please inform me what I can do and how I get my Bitcoins back. Thank You all in advance.

How do I import them please?

how do I find out if my old wallet.dat is the same as the one now? I never created another one. Just the one I have now, its always been the same wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:05:01
OK I will copy my wallet address and download a wallet. I will try and use my current wallet address with the new one and see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:09:32
why electrum though? I have never heard of it
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:10:27
OK I will try that. What is the best online wallet guys? Thanks

Hello, thank you for your reply. I am a total newbie. I can see the transaction tab, I click it but it says no transactions. My balance was around 3.5BTC back in 2010. 
What are my public addresses? Aside from mining a few for a laugh back in the first days of BTC I have never traded, owned or done anything with them so I don't know too much. If you can help me find them I am happy to give you half a bitcoin for your help. Thank You.
