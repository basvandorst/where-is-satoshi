Yea we all know a rise from $.01 to $1 is totally bigger than a rise from $150 to $1000.  Lets ignore that it takes exponentially more money to pump the latter and just call the former a bigger rise because percentages (and to suit agendas) but mostly percentages!

When bitcoin fails to take off, look no further than a community of people like yourself.  Who genuinely believe bitcoin is completely perfect as is, and it's really just the ignorant masses who need to be fixed.  How dense and unaware of your surroundings can you possibly be to believe something like that? 
 "GUYS ARE TECHNOLOGY IS TOTALLY FUCKING PERFECT, I CANT FIND A SINGLE FLAW.  EEEEURREEEKA!  ITS NOT BITCOIN, ITS THE USERS.  IF WE CAN REPROGRAM THOSE IGNORANT STOOGES, SURELY BITCOIN WILL TAKE OFF!!!!!"
Totally NOT a cult though.

Not enough to keep bitcoin out of double digits.  You can down vote me all you want but what I am saying is fact.  If bitcoin doesn't find a a "killer app" the price isn't going to rise, it's going to fall.  That's common sense.  People won't just buy bitcoins as a store of value because magical reasons.

A better indicator of a healthy economy would be retail sales rather than overall transactions per day.  Tony Gallipi from Bitpay said this Dec 2013:


Unfortunately 2014 saw a [stagnation of sales]( for both Bitpay and Coinbase.  And while we don't know exact bitcoin black friday numbers, we can imply from Bitpays lack of transparency that they are lower than last years.  Overstock undershot their estimate of bitcoin sales [by millions of dollars](  And Wordpress had [less than two sales per week with bitcoin](  All in all, it does not look very good as far as retail sales are concerned.

It's some sort of psychological coping mechanism.  If thousands of people call your investment a joke, a fad, or a ponzi scheme you need to justify the money you sunk in it to yourself.  They do this by saying everyone in is a paid shill to cope with the fact that they might be invested in a fad.  If you don't like bitcoin you: don't understand it, are a paid shill, or fear change.  They can't grasp that nobody cares about bitcoin enough to fear it and nobody cares enough to hire shills.  This sub feels the need to find enemies when there simply aren't any.  Mastercard, Paypal, Western Union are all examples of made up enemies that this sub created to make it look like their plight is somehow revolutionary.  It's sad, funny,  and desperate all at once.

You'd think with all this new found demand that the price would stop crashing.  But nope, people just keep adopting to bitcoin and the demand keeps getting higher for bitcoins, and yet the most fundamental aspect of economics - supply and demand - is broken!  Someone should alert every economist in the world and have them re-write all their models.  Bitcoin is the first asset in which demand continues to rise while the price continues to decrease.  Wow, so futuristic!  Future of money indeed!

So they use an internal ledger and skip bitcoin alltogether.  Bitcoin adds nothing new if the block chain is not used.  Deposit funds with Paypal/Credit Card, keep track of funds internally, and withdraw funds the same way.  Bitcoin would be a useless and unnecessary step.  Just like changetip, just like everything else.  Anything off chain is not bitcoin and can be done perfectly fine without it.

In the last two months we've seen well over a dozen exchanges and mining companies go belly up.  For the last 14+ months we've seen the price slide 80%.  Almost every single major bitcoin website has shown a clear decline in traffic in the last year.  Google trends is completely stagnant.  Bitpay + Coinbase retail sales are fully stagnant.  This subreddit has lost traffic from the previous month nearly every month for the last year.  Juniper research report said bitcoin use was on the decline.  Transaction volume USD shows that the network hasn't had any new money injected in to it for a full year.
In fact, the only metric that doesn't show bitcoin is on the decline is transactions per day which is increasing (and also expected to double by 2017 according to Juniper in the same report that noted its usebase is declining) and number of wallets created.  However, as noted by Reuters and many other studies, the amount of wallets that contain bitcoin is well, well under 1 million so even though it's increasing it's not relevant because they contain no bitcoin.  And as far as transactions per day, yes they are increasing, but they aren't an accurate measure of true economic activity.  Most of it is gambling related and not in any way a measure of bitcoin's success.  
My question for you is, can you show me a single metric in which bitcoin is actually gaining adoption?

That's completely untrue.  Transaction fees make a total of 0.5% of their income, the subsidy is the other 99.5%.  Right now miners are specifically ignoring transactions because it's a waste of time to include them in their blocks.  They rather have a better shot at a block reward than to include all transactions in a block.
As I type this there are [4,000 unconfirmed transactions]( specifically because the bitcoin transactional fees are nearly 0.  Of those 4,000 transactions waiting to be processed there is a grand total of $42 in fees, which is actually way more than it usually is. 
Bitcoin elephant in the room  is that a miner has 0 incentive to include any transactions in a block.  Miners are demonstrably ignoring transactions in favor of faster block propagation times.

All crypto communities from litecoin to bitcoin to paycoin exhibit the same delusions.  I can go on copy and paste a comment, replace litecoin with bitcoin and get a  upvoted comment in a post here.  The same arguments for why litecoin can succeed apply to any crypto.  The communities are equally as delusional and both use the same arguments and logical fallacies for why their currency is the one true crypto.  The parallels to crypto cults and religion is fascinating.  Paycoin is the worst with a 10 out of 10 on the delusion scale, but bitcoin isn't that far behind.

Fast - 10 minute average confirmation times, sometimes as long as 2 hours
Cheap - Talk to me about cheap when your mining subsidy dries up.  Hello $10 per transaction
No reversals - Ok we're talking about advantages here, not crippling flaws
Spare me your buzz word soup, there's no advantages of bitcoin over a credit card.  In fact there are far LESS advantages for using bitcoin.
Even with Bit Reserve, you still need to buy extra coins to guard against the volatility that might occur in the minutes between purchases.  On top of that bitcoin does not give me cash back, it does not offer consumer protections, and it is easily hacked with the only thing I will receive after my funds are stolen is a "Sorry for your loss" in this subreddit.

6 years is old?  Six years in technology is ANCIENT.  In 6 years after HTTP (71 million users later) we had Amazon, eBay, and Hotmail - all killer apps, all still around today.  Bitcoin is by no means "infantile", that's really getting to be an old excuse.  6 years of bitcoin and you can count the number of solid bitcoin businesses on one hand.  There's no clear killer app, and the amount of worldwide users is less than 1% of where HTTP was in 6 years.  Clearly bitcoin has a ways to go, but it's by no means "infantile".

5%?  The annual inflation rate of 2014 was 1.6%.  The inflation rate for 2013 was 1.5%.  5% is a nice libertarian talking point though, but the last time we saw inflation that high was over 30 years ago.

The problem is an inherent protocol flaw with bitcoin.  Miners don't include all transactions in a block because they have no incentive to do so.  They don't want to risk an orphaned block by including all transactions.  It makes more economical sense for them to put less transactions per block.  The blocks are by no means full, the miners are just greedy.  Increasing the block size will not fix this, you would need to change how the protocol works completely - and we all know that'll never happened.  So alas, bitcoin is not suitable for mass adoption yet.
Also you can't criticize bitcoin in this place is strictly for things that are good for bitcoin.  For shame for pointing out the obvious, OP, for shame.

The problem isn't block size.  The problem is not block limit.  The problem is miners are deliberately ignoring most transactions because they have 0 financial incentive to include them.  The miners are purposely delaying your transaction because to include them risks him losing the block reward.

So Dell accepts USD from Coinbase, not bitcoin.  You paid Coinbase USD for your bitcoins.
So....you sent USD to Coinbase who sent USD to Dell.  Can anyone help me figure out how this purchase involved bitcoin in any way shape or form?  No bitcoin changed hands in any way.  Coinbase just edited their internal ledger to show that you now own less bitcoin, and then sent the USD you sent them right to dell.  
Not a single step in that process involved bitcoin.

Yes that's what happens when the top exchange at the time has bots which sole purpose is to buy bitcoins with fake USD and not sell any bitcoins.  Guess what that does?  Drives up the price!  But I guess we should ignore the fact that November 2013 price was completely faked all the way to $1,000 and that April 2013 had another trading bot dubbed Markus which also likely caused that bubble.

Most people admit they are wrong when they are wrong.  Not you, you continue to make stuff up despite being obviously wrong.  Let's recap:
* Bitcoin can not handle the traffic of WoW
* "Off chain" is a fancy word for "not in any way involving bitcoin"(see: changetip)
* Bitcoin adds nothing to WoW that fiat doesn't
* Paypal and Credit Cards were widely used enough to make WoW the most popular game in the world
* And lastly:  In a mere 24 hours, more people purchased a WoW expansion pack upon release than the number of people who used bitcoin in the last 6 years.  In fact, you can take 30% of the people who bought the WoW expansion pack in the first 24 hours of its release, and it would STILL be larger than the number of world wide bitcoin users.

Find me a board outside penny stock forums where the user base claims their asset will be worth 100x the initial value that it is today in just a few short months.  Find me a forum (again, outside of penny stock forums) that the user base proclaims an 85% drop is actually good news and just means the next big bubble is on its way and anyone who doesn't invest all their money now will not be an early adopter.  Find me another technology where its users go door to door preaching to businesses pushing it on people despite the fact that nobody will even use it.  Find me another asset/technology whose leaders (ie Roger Ver and the twins) make exorbitant claims about the future of said asset that are blatantly untrue, misleading, and just manipulating people into purchasing said asset.  Find me a tech where the community escalates their leaders to god status.
I mean seriously, you guys are not at all innocent.  Your community blatantly misrepresents what bitcoin is, blatantly exaggerates its potential 100x over, and then creates companies like Changetip which clearly serve one purpose and one purpose only: further adoption via spam.

Find me a single industry where every single company that starts up collapses within 4 years.  It's not normal, and it doesn't happen.  Bitcoin businesses are just fly by night operations for the most part.  They set themselves up, establish a userbase, and then "get hacked" and disappear.  Seen it 1000 times.  There's a few legit ones like Coinbase, Circle, etc, but for the most part all are just chop shops setup to steal your money.


I'm certain it was the oldest exchange, and it's one of the oldest companies, I don't know of any older but there may be some that exist. 


Sorry talking points, buzz words, whatever.  Whenever confronted a typical response from a bitcoiner is to inject VC into the situation.  You guys know damn well almost all of what venture capitalists invest in is a complete flop.  Just take a look @ Segwey with over 100 million in VC that was a complete flop.  For every 1 successful VC funded operation there's 9 failures.  VC means nothing.  And bitcoin VC is all going towards: exchanges, payment processors, mining operations, and other financial services. ~90% of it is.  AKA it's going towards things that already exist, nothing innovative.  If bitcoin is so revolutionary, why isn't the VC going towards new ideas, stuff that doesn't exist, and stuff that can't be done with fiat?  Right now all that money is being put towards cloning fiat infrastructure, except now it's with bitcoin.  Cool, that's necessary in order for bitcoin to succeed, but guess what?  That's not going to help with adoption.  You can put all the VC in the world towards payment processors, but that doesn't change the fact that bitcoin does nothing new for the average consumer.
We obviously have polar opposite views, there's no point in continuing.  That's why debate is pointless, both sides have debated till we're blue in the face.  What it comes down to is reality, so we'll just have to wait and see what happens.  Right now though, if 2014 is any predictor of the future - it's not looking good.

You can show all of the increases in hardware and bandwidth you want, but that doesn't change the fact that **bitcoin is currently centralized**.  You think people are going to max out their 100mbit lines and broadcast 20 mb blocks every 10 minutes while having massive amounts of hard drive space laying around for the block chain?  For now we'll ignore the fact that 20mb isn't even that many transactions compared to large companies or states/countries.
Let me ask you this....currently bitcoin is centralized, a few pools own the majority of hash rate on the network.  Why would that change?  The only way that happens is if bandwidth and disk space greatly outpace adoption numbers.  It's already centralized and if bitcoin grows it's going to get worse, unless some drastic change occurs in the protocol.

No it isn't.  If bitcoin doesn't find a good use case within the next few years, it's going to continually decline.  You think people will buy bitcoin as a store of value when it has no underlying use?  That doesn't make any sense at all.  If that was the case then beanie babies would still be a good store of value.

There's no reason to suspect the trend is over.  When we hit $275 in October the market looked like it was rebounding for a couple months, just like now.  Also, nothing in the ecosystem has changed in the last year to make your average person want to buy bitcoin.  There's still no legitimate use case for an every day person.  And if you take a look at the [transactional volume USD]( you can see it's been flat for the last year.  From this we can infer that bitcoin user adoption is stagnating, which means there will be less demand for coins at this price level.  I see no reason why this pump from $166 is different from any of the last medium sized pumps we've seen in 2014.

That's exactly why your community is in the state that it's in.  Bitcoiners have genuinely convinced themselves that bitcoin is the correct position to take, and that anything that opposes bitcoin is wrong.  You aren't interested in opposing views, and you aren't interested in facts.  You're only interested in anything that puts bitcoin in a good light.  And despite the fact that you will say this is not true, it's absolutely true.  There's not a community of 5,000 people actively mocking bitcoin because you guys are a sane rational tech loving community.  There's a community of 5,000 people mocking you because you deny reality, facts, and reason while purporting to do the exact opposite. 
You don't care that Juniper Research just came out with a report saying bitcoin adoption is on the decline.  You don't care that Peter Todd can list off a half dozen ways you can bring down the entire bitcoin network for free.  You don't care about the Federal Reserve saying bitcoin retail sales are negligible.  You don't care about 99.5% of miners revenue being from a subsidy that is quickly evaporating.   You don't care that 70% of your transactions per day are chain transactions.  You don't care that over 50% of your daily transactions are simply gambling related.  You just don't care.  
Bitcoin is quickly approaching a halving which the reward will be cut in half.  Overnight miners will make 50% less money.  The fees earned from transactions are .5% of a miners total income.  Since the inception of bitcoin, coins earned from transactional fees has actually decreased!  How can you possibly sit here and tell me that bitcoin is sustainable when literally 99.5% of a miners revenue comes from a subsidy which is scheduled to disappear over time!  Transactional fees are demonstrably NOT going up what so ever, and have in fact gone down - even as transactions per day is increasing.

@_date: 2015-03-06 14:50:09


Sorry, but the number of transactions per day has went from 1,000 to 100,000 in the last 4 years.  The amount miners get from transactional fees actually went down in the last 4 years, not up.  The exact opposite of what you said would happen is happening.  99.5% of a miners income is subsidy.  While not all of that will need to be replaced with transaction fees, a large portion of it will be.  Transactions being cheap is a myth and completely unsustainable.
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:37:04
In theory that sounds good, but in reality that's not what we have seen.  I see daily losses from users of this subreddit - supposed techies.  Multi-sig sounds good on paper, but in practice it is not used much.  Even large exchanges like Bitstamp JUST started using multi-sig.  You can not expect average joes to learn about it and apply it correctly either.  Many users can't even remember a password let alone deal with multi sig.  
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:36:00


So basically "yes a 51% attack is a serious issue, but it won't happen because it's against their best interests".
Let me ask you this, are you willing to establish a financial system that resides on the fact that people "probably" won't attack it because it is against their best interest?
How about this scenario: I kidnap the family of 2-3 mining pools, force them to relinquish control to me and do a 51% attack.  Not only does that cost nothing, but it would be fairly simple to execute for organized crime or terrorists.
The fact is these large pools are central points of failure and are a huge problem with bitcoin.  Just because it's not in their best interests (although that is speculation and remains to be seen) doesn't mean it's not a problem.  Another scenario would be government putting legal pressure on pool operators and forcing the operator to relinquish control or face prison time.
Fact is it doesn't matter if it's in their best interest.  Huge mining pools and asic farms are centralized points of failure within the bitcoin network.
Also there's more than 51% attacks.  It only takes 33% of the hash power to consistently steal block rewards from other miners. Look up selfish mining.
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:18:01
Its the elephant in the room, the network is completely unsustainable.  The devs nor the community have a plan of action to solve this obvious problem.  The general consensus according to both community and devs are that the free market will magically sort this problem out.  Gavin wants to raise the block limit so more transactions replaces the subsidy, but as you point out more transactions demonstrably does not increase transaction fees.

Yup, a maximum of 3 transactions per second, a dwindling subsidy with no fees to make up for it, excessive use of power, impossible to secure, no use cases, exponentially increasing block chain, impossibility of remaining decentralized while also scaling to meet real demands, centralization via asic farms and mining pools, excessive centralization in one country, China, excessive use in scams and fraud...none of those are problems.

Uhm the author of this article gave no reasons to support his argument.  He says hoarding is somehow good for bitcoin, but gives no evidence, examples, or reasons for this.  Not surprising, because it's blatantly not true.  If you think bitcoin will magically become valuable because you just hold it and not use it, you are SORELY mistaking.  A healthy economy has a constant recirculation of money, how can you tell me buying entries on a ledger and forgetting about them is a good thing?
Do you guys really believe bitcoin will become a store of value if that's its only use?  Unless bitcoin acquires a use case, bitcoin is useless.  My mom won't go out and buy bitcoin if it has no uses, and neither will anyone else.  People purchase gold because 1.) it's used in jewelry 2.) electronics and 3.) because of speculation.  However you can't have 3.) without at least 1 or 2 coming first.  If bitcoin finds no uses, a store of value isn't going to be its killer app.  Hoarding bitcoin will only prove to be a worth while cause if bitcoin has other use cases on top of just speculation.  An asset can not solely thrive on speculation, because eventually as years pass, what exactly are you speculating on?  Surely if a few more years go by without a killer app, you aren't speculating on bitcoin's success anymore.
As much as you would all like to get rich from doing nothing but holding bitcoin, that absolutely will not happen unless bitcoin becomes useful for the average joe and the average joe starts buying it.  "Bitcoin bugs" aren't going to increase the value at all. 
The author of this article seems to have a libertarian gold bug mentality and incorrectly assumes the rest of the world has his same mind set.  Well they don't, and nobody will be using bitcoin as a store of value unless it has other uses.

Gold is used for jewelry and electronics and the market for those is huge.  That + speculation gives gold value.  Without any underlying utility (ie a currency) nothing would keep bitcoin alive except speculation.  Bitcoin can not solely exist on speculation, it has to have some underlying use (ie as a payment utility).

Because instead of an organization pumping bitcoin, the community pumps it.  This community is full of pumpers pushing bitcoin talking about getting rich.  Theres even door to door missionaries pushing it to businesses.  And with each sign up they get a small piece of profit in the form of a higher bitcoin price.  Each person they sign up increases the price of bitcoin slightly more.  Its a community driven pyramid, although you can make an argument the btc foundation is the organizer.  Id explain more in detail but Im on mobile.  The similarities are too much to ignore.

You quite literally made that up.  For every one failed bitcoin businesses, I can find you 10 successful dot com startups that survived the bubble.  Fact is, CaVirtex was the oldest bitcoin business to exist @ 3.5 years old.  And now they are gone.  You can down play it all you want, Bter, CaVirtex, Vault of Satoshi, and probably a few more I'm missing were definitely medium sized exchanges and all of them very established.  Fine, exchanges like Excoin are small and irrelevant, you have a point there.  But the number of medium sized businesses to fail within the last 2 months is still over a dozen.  When the oldest bitcoin exchange fails, you have to think why it's happening.  I mean seriously, not one bitcoin company has been around since the early days, the failure rate of bitcoin companies is 100%.  100% of bitcoin businesses fail.  Think about that.


Ok so we're getting somewhere...now find me ANY metric that supports that bitcoin is growing.


That's an awful lot of meaningless buzzwords.  I see little improvement.  I see multiple people losing money daily in I see monthly if not weekly exchange hacks from major companies.  Bitcoin security is quite frankly abysmal and even with multi-sig and trezor it's not improving at all.  Losses are astounding with numbers fast approaching 1 billion dollars of stolen coins stolen in the history of bitcoin.  That's 33% of the entire market cap!

That chart shows the true cost per transaction.  That is the corresponding USD value to how much bitcoin a miner receives per transaction.  Currently a miner receives roughly $10 USD per transaction.  


You are right, it will not work.  Every 4 years as the reward halves, that will become more and more clear.  Currently 95.5% of the miners revenue at the moment is from the subsidy.  Only .5% is from transaction fees.  In 2016 when the miner reward halves, either a huge drop in hash rate will happen or a huge increase in transactional fees.
