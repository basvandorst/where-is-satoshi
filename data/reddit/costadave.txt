I just tried it with a modest investment of $50 just to see how it all worked.  I was able to immediately open and account and fund it with Paypal, although my limit is $78 every 24 hours.  I'm sure after trading with them a while, this limit would be raised.  It was very quick and easy to get to the point where I could actually buy bitcoins.
They charged a $2 fee for accepting Paypal, so I was left with $48 to trade.  First I had to buy SLL, so I just did a market buy and ended up with 11,746.48.  The volume is pretty low so I didn't want to wait for a limit order.  For this I was able to get .33 BTC with another market buy and was left with a negligible amount of SLL left over (117.14).  
So, I paid $50 for .33 BTC, which is pretty pricey considering at the time Mt.Gox was showing $117.
When I tried to withdraw my BTC, I was informed that as a new account there is a manual confirmation that must occur and my bitcoins could be delayed as long as 48 hours.  Not a big deal as long as I really get it within 48 hours.  My simple test today was not designed to include having to interact with their customer service, so I'm really hoping this goes off without a hitch.
I probably wouldn't buy more using this method.  I do think, however, that for somebody who needed to quickly liquidate some bitcoins and get the funds into their Paypal account, this could be a very good option.  It says there are no withdraw limits, but I'm guessing they still have the 48-hour manual confirmation required.  This seems to me to be the safest way to sell bitcoins for Paypal.  Plus, they are selling above Mt.Gox, so you might get a little bonus.
