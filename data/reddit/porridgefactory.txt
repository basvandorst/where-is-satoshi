We've been living in a paradise holiday the last 2 months and now we are back to regular life.

There's a reason their offices are generally in the fanciest buildings in town.

I had this problem too.  One of my miners, this 'recipe' worked to adjust both fans.  On another miner, it only adjusted one fan.  Perhaps it depends on how they are set up.  Or, this just came to me now, perhaps it depends on which fan plug the fans are plugged into.  Can you move the fan plugs around?

agreed.  It's not a crash in my opinion until it goes down to at least $2000
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:15:46
congrats.  It's not easy to save but you are well on your way.

good point.  Blockchain tech is extremely valuable and useful.  So far, Bitcoin has been a pretty good weather gauge of the industry on a whole.  If Bitcoing goes to $1000 and everything else increase 2x then we can be worried.  If everything goes down to 1/10 of the value, it's a chance for a lucrative investment.  Like the .com (internet) bubble, There's a good chance it's all going to crash, but then slowly work it's way up again to some of the worlds most important industries.

lol- nice :)

agreed - most learn pretty early to spend all that they have as soon as they can... plus a little more.

who thinks the price rise is a result of people buying before the segwit2x split.  Perhaps hoping to get double the coins.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:26:00
Where are the segwit wallets??

Many parts of the world are heated by electricity.  North American (Canada at least) is heated by gas but Northern Europe is heated by electricity.  Having that electric heat contributing to the blockchain at the same time is a no brainer.

not sure there will ever be a big crash.  it might dip a bit and the price will get 'corrected' but with a finite supply and demand, the price isn't going to completely crash

once bitcoin gets to a crazy value... 10.000 or 100.000 USD people will be more comfortable using miniBits or microBits  A candy bar can cost 1 miniBit

checking it out...

Nice - hopefully other countries follow suite.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:09:21
Yes, hopefully more usage friendly laws are on their way.  People can't use Bitcoin in their daily life when they have to report every little capital gain - like you say.  Once Bitcoin becomes more widely used (if).. I'm sure the legislation will be updated.

Yes there are many very positive built in traits as well. Put that doesn't negate the simple fact that people, on a whole, will always be greedy.

The one thing that will **never** change.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:08:06
spend and replace.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:33:58
What exactly are you trying to argue about. I havent disagreed with anything you've said.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:11:40
Yep - it always holds true.  Be **Fearful** when **others** are **greedy** and **greedy when others are fearful**  \-  **Warren Buffett**
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:58:41
Yep.  I'm using bluewallet.  Works like a charm :)  There are also stores that have started to accept LN
