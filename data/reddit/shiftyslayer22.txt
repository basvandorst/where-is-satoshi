Look into dollar-cost averaging your investment if you are not positive with your analysis of the BTC market, just Google it and see if it's something you'd find beneficial, imo it's on a strong push rn as I type, look to see what happens when it gets near it's ATH and see how the market reacts, use GDAX and see where the liquidity in the market is sitting

Network congestion, youre paying to get your transaction on the next block ( fast transaction time) rather than waiting behind all those who paid to get in before your free transaction can. ( hours of waiting)

Just a guess that such a milestone, whole, nice number to cash out at has a lot of sell orders at it, if also assume that a few people have undercut those sell or see orders a little, hence why the price is slightly stagnating. Buyers are waiting for sellers to come down and vice versa. Much like a skating rink dance when a boy goes to get a girl or vice versa ... just waiting for the moment, but sometimes you have to be the one who goes in first!
