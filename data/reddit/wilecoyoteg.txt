Keep up the good work guys

Most people who wanted to sell have already sold, the strong hands remain.
People looking to buy back in are waiting for positive signs (the "next alt season", bakkt etc).
We are going sideways on low volume for a while until something big tips the balance either way! Let's hope on the positive side.

Their support has always been solid but at times very slow. They get there in the end.

I'm no expert on OTC markets but there's a few big, trusted ones out there that will take your order of that size. [ (e.g. Circle, Gensis etc.). It would be a good idea to check a few of them out and go with the one with the best terms. Good luck!

10 minutes is still too long!

TLDR; OP is accusing the exchange of trying to steal his tiny bag of delisted shit coins.

Sorry but this is really nothing to get excited about. Delete all of the bot, shill, fake accounts and that number is halved.
Active users is a much better metric...

What are you fucking 12 years old?
The guy has more money than you. Get over it &amp; welcome to the real world.

I just looked at the modified image, the customer is correct, it is completely trivial and doesn't change the meaning of anything. 
Are you at least going to tell him who is "investigating" his account? Is it Binance or is it law enforcement? 
This does not inspire confidence.

You will get your money. Just be patient. Bank delays are a thing in this space. Bitstamp are legit and have been around since forever. They're not trying to steal your chump change.
And when you get the funds be sure to update this thread (spoiler: you won't).

Nice, starting to see some real momentum here
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:38:15
Agreed. If these coins are shitcoins, then this hitpiece is a shitpiece. It's all negative and toxic.

This. It doubled and they could have taken their original capital off the table.

Are my POWR and NEBLIO bags ever going to have that sooner or later moment?
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:44:39
I agree that the explanation is odd.
Skilledguy, if indeed you have some kind of weird browser that automatically translates or might have in some way corrupted the original message, can you tell us what browser that is? Even better, perhaps simply make a recording of your screen as you open the message and we can see the browser changing the text in real time. This would put the matter to rest.

Not sure that Snowden's crypto thoughts carry much weight... Still interesting to read, thanks for posting.

Why did you doctor a screenshot, what's the explanation? I guess this may be a sticking point for Binance. It makes you look dodgy when perhaps it was a harmless moment of poor judgement on your behalf to speed up the process! Heck who here hasn't e.g. changed October to November at least once in their life because they lost a gas bill and couldn't KYC.
Good luck in any case. So many sad fucks on this thread wishing you bad.

This time last year everyone was begging me to help them buy Bitcoin. I didn't need to "convince" them of anything. Still feel a bit bad though for helping.
