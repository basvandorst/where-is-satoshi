I been using them since before gox collapsed. Have never had any serious problems. Withdrawals always timely. 
No shenanigans, stable prices, all combinations BTC/LTC/BCH &lt;~&gt; USD/EUR pairs. Some of the eur pairs used to be low volume but much better now.
For Europeans it’s a no brainier SEPA withdrawals very low fees, very quick.

This is a bitcoin sub. A guy made a post explaining why he thought BCH more closely resembled bitcoins original value proposition.
Instead of discussing why he was wrong he was simply called a “bcash shill”.
Now you are here doubling down on it.
The same thing happens on rbtc, if anyone tries to discuss the merits of a BTC+LN solution. People start yelling “core shill”. 
That’s crappy “discussion” too. I downvote it.
So yes, the problem exists on both subs and that comment was a perfect example. 
If just one person reads this post and thinks, “actually yeah, just auto dismissing people who disagree with me as ‘shills’ is kinda close minded” then it was worth posting.
I represent BCH supporters who think critically and understand the pros and cons of both scaling solutions and have made their mind up based on understanding. We’ll talk about facts and we’ll call out bad discussion, and keep doing so because we are passionate about bitcoin and how it can change the world. 
If people are interested cool, if people just calls is bcash shills, well honey badger DGAF.

The costs associated with increased blocksize are trivial compared to the costs associated with operating mining hardware.

Insightful and I think people dont quite get this. The block reward (coinbase) is just initial distribution of the coin.
 
The people investing the cash in the hardware to mine are the people who are buying the ICO so to speak.

Srsly though, you are spot on - its not about the client its about what the community agrees is bitcoin through leveraging their financial vote.
ie Right now BTC is Bitcoin (whether I like it or not!) but should the price flip and concomitantly the longest POW chain. It would be hard to argue that Bitcoin hadn't moved on.

A false promise is where you say something that isn’t true to trick people.
BCH delivers on its promises. They said they would fork, they said they would go to 8mb max block-size. They said they would test massive scale. They said they would innovate. They said there were huge partnerships coming.
All these things have happened.
Congrats to yeah we pinky promise to do 2x so long as y’all do segwit first.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:15:25


I'm well aware thats a possibility. I've spent a long time thinking about exactly how that could be what the various motives of each player is, what will happen if I am wrong.
I have BTC exposure as a slight hedge (first loves eh!). Its the lowest $ amount I've held in years (2%) and that represents my total loss of faith in it. I still have some Bitcoin ETF in a SIPP but I've sold 90% of my original position in that too. Diversified back into equities.
I never had any doubt that bitcoin could scale as described in the white paper. Thats why I think Bitcoin Cash has no problem scaling either. Bitcoin Core going in a different direction wasn't for me. Same reason why I don't think lite coin is the answer - segwit &amp; LN instead of simple on chain scaling. (still have some LTC though).
My advice to anyone new entering the space is that they should hedge and go 50/50 Core/Cash. Maybe even a few percent in other alts they like.
That's not scamming thats rational diversification based on the presumption that no-one knows what the future holds.
My Core/Cash split is not entirely irrational (not the herp derp I sold all my BTX for BTY that you hear), but its heavily weighted according to what I see as fundamentals. It's only the market speculation that is keeping me in BTC right now.

Ask yourself why I believe I am right. I’ve been into BItcoin for  6years now I know the whitepaper inside out. I’ve read so much that i can’t remember a time when I didn’t know what bitcoin was or how it worked. I’ve seen everything unfold in the blocksize debate. I’ve watched people’s changing behaviour. Ive seen scam after scam unfold. I’ve been burned by a few! I’ve read the LN whitepaper, debated it, imagined it at scale. I’ve taken the time to understand segwit. I’ve watched it’s real world performance. I’ve become despondent that the bitcoin I loved seems to be changing to something else. 
I’ve had to reconsider what feels like lifetime if HODL to come to the decision to switch to BCH (people seriously have no idea how difficult a decision it is to let go). I push the “bcash agenda” because that’s what it was always about. It was never about settlement.
Yes it’s for the new users, because the ones that are true core believers probably won’t change their mind but those coming in for the first time deserve to see bits sides and choose on merit.
If you don’t think so then I think it is you who is trying to prop up the price of BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-12 20:14:56


Assume you meant centralised? If so, I understand why you think that, as the original bitocin MO was everyone is a miner. Over time though, what happens is that mining is done by companies (its in the white paper). A lot of people think this is "centralisation of bitcoin", but there's another view that actually its still not 'centralised' because provided there is more than one miner, then no one central authority is in control. It only needs enough players that if one of them tries to mess, the others can go NO, and orphan them.
Its natural to think that the centralisation trend will end at a single player, but thats not the case, because a large player is economically rational, and they understand that undermining the 'decentralised' part (ie going over 51%) threatens the value of their investment.
For me it's a behavioural problem, miners are compelled to behave (unless they are irrational/dishonest in which case all bets are off anyway!), I think it's often overlooked because a lot of people into bitcoin/crypto are very technical and only care about the 1's and 0's of it all.
But thats just my take, who knows if I'm right. You should DWTFYWTD :)

@_date: 2017-12-12 08:09:17
By increasing block size more and more users come on board the network gets bigger and more valuable and more profit is to be made from mining encouraging more miners to enter the space.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:23:27
Mining continues indefinitely, in time fees replace the block reward as the incentive for miners.
Realistically this happens quite a bit before 2140 see 
Block reward is only the incentive at the beginning because its not yet widely adopted. Over time that problem goes away, and there are so many transactions happening that the cost of mining and running the network becomes socialised over all the end users. The more end users their are, the cheaper it is per user!
So the way BCH folk see it is that this will be millions of tiny fees, which add up to a significant amount for the miners. This comes as a result of on-chain usage. The argument against it is that this is 'centralised' because someone needs to make the miners honest. Cashers will point out that miners are honest because why would you kill the goose that is laying you golden eggs. In many systems you can make more money being dishonest, however in bitocin it is turned on its head. You make more money being honest, and the bigger the system the bigger the mining incentive, the more likely they are to be honest!
However core don't beleive this is sufficient and feel like there is some need for everyone to run full nodes in order to keep check on the miners. Furthermore that people need to use LN as a second layer to transact, because that keeps things off chain, in order to achieve the goal of having everyone run full nodes.
On the face of it this seems like a smart idea, in fact I even came up with 'second layer' myself in 2013, 2 years before LN was published: 
However when i eventually read LN white paper and though about it was clear that the natural tendency in LN is towards massive hubs that have channels with everyone (the white paper describes the expected topology of the network at scale as being like the internet with Tier 1 providers etc), and for end users to just have a one or two channels, everything goes through the major hubs. When you think about this its essentially recreating banking on top of bitcoin.
It seems counter intuitive, and the arguments for mining centralisation are very compelling, but what people fail to see is the incentive mechanism relies on miners being honest. If the aren't the market will turn against them. 
The price volatility you see is the speculative mania, where people that don't understand the underlying fundamentals periodically rotate in because price is going up causing a bubble, and then rotate out when the selling starts. All the while though there is a 'base price' which will follow an s-curve of adoption.
This is what the HODLers recognise, and so don't get caught up in the mania (well, at least dont make rash decisions! everyone loves a run up to boost morale!) they just HODL based on fundamentals.
The speculators will probably chase BTC for while, but the HODLers that understand Bitcoins fundamental value proposition as "P2P Electronic Cash" are slowly moving over to BCH as that is a better fit with what was described in the white paper.
But people will do whatever they want to do, they will beleive what they beleive first and rationalise the belief second.
Changing your mind is hard. I know, I had to do it and it was agonising. The blocksize debate was so stressful.
When BCH forked all of a sudden it all become so clear again. Now I am confident (not sure of course, one should never be sure about anything!) and I sleep easier at night.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:56:40
The difference is that every single time it happened before everyone was able to hold because they could see that in the future it would replace cash. The “crashes” were the speculators speculating. The holders were looking at the s-curve of adoption. Now there is no s-curve of adoption because the shepherds of Bitcoin have explicitly redefined it as something other than electronic cash.

One man's scrupulousness is another mans pedanticism.
The nature of things is that they are complex, journalists that dumb things down, and attempt to maintain group think are guilty of trying to hide the richness and beauty in things. Maybe BTC will amount to nothing, maybe it won't. Maybe this seedling will grow in to a beautiful flower... NOT IF I STAMP ON IT HAHAHA. Yeah, real nice attitude that.
There are myriad ways in which the author reveals either an inability to be open minded and think critically, or more likely his intentional use of inflammatory references and tone. What exactly are his motives. To get more clicks to drive revenue. To protect all the innocent people out their from the evils of bitcoin? To keep the money machine at VISA safely oiled? I'm not in a position to say. Perhaps you are.
This article is no better than some troll on bitcointalk posting tired rehashed cliche arguments (For whichever side they are claiming to represent).
What bothers me (and probably shouldn't because it will never change) is the lack of journalistic credibility, and the "I think, so you should think..." mentality. Maybe we should give this thing a shot. Maybe, if he tries it, he might actually like it after all.

The article title states its a bad payment option.
The article goes on to say (in the summary and the body) the reason is because it costs money to convert dollars to bitcoin.
It may not be a good payment method for him, because he doesn't have bitcoin. USD is crap payment method for me because I don't have any.
If I wrote an article explaining how bad USD is as a payment method because I don't have any, and because i get charged commission to convert my GBP. I think the consensus response would be 'herp'.
Thats what's happening here. If he wrote the real article "bitcoin is a bad payment option for me" there wouldn't be an issue (or likely an article at all).

Yes, but who was it that charged those fees? The point is that any charges you incur buying bitcoin are nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with the fiat banking system.
So bitch about fees all you like, understand who it is that is charging you though.
Specifically, it isn't even a property of fiat currency, but the banks themselves. To get money into bitstamp cost me well over 30eur to transfer from bitstamp back to the same account, bistamp charged me in the region of 0.30eur.
There is nothing wrong with bitcoin fees, and everything wrong with bank charges.

you misunderstand. I am talking solely about the blockchain, the blocks contained therein and how the longest chain represents what bitcoin is and what the consensus is. The sum of which is "the consensus mechanism"
Why the miners choose rules, accept/reject blocks is due to the "incentive mecahanism" which is what keeps miners in check. 
The miners don't have all the influence, they won't have more or less power by being able to determine block size. They will still be incentivised to provide to the market what it wants (which I think are fast, cheap, secure &amp; transactions on an open distributed trustless ledger/network)
You are suffering from the fear of majority dishonest miners. The only cure is to look at the whole history of bitcoin, and how during that entire time it has always been more beneficial to miners to be 'honest'.

Don't ever explain bitcoin like that, unless you want people to think its the rapture.
First tell them its cash OTI, you buy it from &lt;insert your favourite site&gt;, or in some places you can get it from an ATM by paying in paper money
Then tell them once you got some bitcoin you can put it on your phone like this (show them your phone wallet).
Then tell them you can pay for stuff or send them to other people without giving anyone credit card details, (then get them to download breadwallet or some other app) and send them 1000bits.
When people see how fast and easy it is they either get it, or they were never going to get it.
If they want to tell you its worth nothing then just nod agree and leave them to it. You planted the seed, give it time to grow, arguing about it just makes people think you are crazy.

Its my understanding that BU's philosophy is to let the free market decide the acceptable maximum block size, and has developed a mechanism by which participants can signal a preference.
Whereas the core strategy appears to be for a cabal of developers to decided what the capacity of the network should be.

Non-mining nodes have no power.
If they did, then you might have explained the mechanism by which they prevent miners continuing to build the strongest POW chain.
What you described instead was the market taking action to devalue a chain that it does not favour. This has very little to do with non-mining nodes.

Until you go to the faculty and have a look then they neither exist nor do not exist!
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:57:31
There are two mechanisms at play:
The consensus mechanism is concerned with the physical(digital?) manifestation of consensus through extension of the block chain. Whichever block the majority is ming on top if is (notwithstanding luck) the tip of the chain.
The incentive mechanism is concerned with rewarding miners for mining on top of the block that follows rules that the market deems most desirable (hence most valuable). The market can thus convince miners not mine on top of blocks that follow certain rules.
This is the yin and yang of bitcoin. Neither can exist without the other.


Bitcoin is always the strongest chain (as backed by the majority hash). During a window wherein the market values a minority chain higher, there arises the possibility that the market will take actions to devalue the majority chain and add value to the minority chain.
This window would only exist if the market truly feels that the majority miners are doing something very wrong (if its a minority it doeasn't matter because they can't build a stronger chain). If this scenario was actually realised then the market can take the necessary steps to "punish" the majority miners by not buying their coins.


The reason a transaction is on one chain and not the other is likely to be because the person that made the transaction has gone to certain lengths to ensure it. Likely for reasons of 'voting' for/against chains. In this case the user is speculating. Which may or may not pay off in the long run.
Anyone else should broadcast to both chains, then no matter which chain prevails, your transaction is on it. (with caveats about mempool congestions, fees, reduced hashrate of minority chain etc etc).
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:05:04


Don't forget the part that "Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them."
Nodes, at the time, means miners. The way they reject a block is by not mining on top of it, as per the post you replied to.
@_date: 2017-02-18 20:08:51
You are describing a scenario where you *want* coins to split.
Normal use of bitcoin is that when you broadcast a transaction you want that transaction recorded regardless of whether a HF will/has happened, regardless of orphans, re-orgs etc
The default operation of bitcoin should always be this.
If you want to do something funky with only 1 chain then you need to "split" your coins, by making transactions that *cannot* be broadcast on the other chain. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:10:19
You're conflating incentive &amp; power.
The speculator cannot mine a block. The speculator can only buy or sell coins.
Only miners can extend the blockchain. This is the power. The incentive mechanism ensures they wield that power "responsibly"; That they extend the blockchain in such a fashion that the market (users, speculators) finds bitcoin to still be valuable.

The premise of bitcoin is that the majority of miners are honest, without that bitcoin (core or unlimited) doeasn't work.
Equally there is a the implicit assumption that those honest miners are economically rational.
Your split chain example relies on a malicious miner that is economically irrational, choosing to continue mining a weaker chain. 
Your arguments about BU being fundamentally flawed are based on fantastic hypothetical scenarios. If I apply that same level of imagination to, say, SWSF. I can tell you all about how thousands of blocks down the line the miners can reorg and spend everyone's coins! It's absurd.
Signalling is like having a conversation in public about what might be acceptable. It can be gamed, sure, but rational and honest miners know that doing so is probably bad for business in the long term. It's no more consensus than miners saying they are ready for SWSF. 
Actually mining blocks is effecting change that has been tentatively agreed on. Only once those blocks become the tip of the strongest chain is actual consensus established. It's then up to each and every BU miner to decide whether they think there is a future in some other chain or whether they change their settings to being themselves in line with the strongest chain.
Its Nakamoto consensus in action. It's beautifully simple, that's how you can tell it's right.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:01:59




I'm challenging your claim that non-mining nodes *create* consensus. They can't extend the chain, so what exactly is the mechanism by which they *create* consensus?
Furthermore non-mining nodes cannot prevent miners from extending the chain (i.e. the process of creating consensus), if a miner publishes a block your node doesn't like your node can ignore it. You can't prevent the block from propagating around you though. If other miners choose to build on that block your non-mining node cannot stop them. The only way to make an economically rational miner switch chains is to create a stronger one. Or a more valuable one. Your node cannot do either of those things. Only Miners can do the former, only users can do the latter.
Your node can continue to think that the tip of the chain is a block that the majority has power has long since orphaned. There may even be some hash that speculates that it can make more money by extending your chain, if some people are running nodes then it must have some value to those node operators.
You might even create a nascent market in Original Bitcoin, and that's cool. Live and let live. I'd have a few satoshis on your chain too :) I don't think that is the threat to bitcoin that some would have others believe.

The "nobody is forcing you" argument is disingenuous. In the very next sentence you yourself explain why people are "forced" to run with the status quo, because in actual fact there is no viable alternative.
BU allows for people to signal they are OK with something different, but without having to actually publish block and risk loss of revenue.
Antagonists are desperate to point out the potential abuse. Every time they do so, it is on the premise that the majority of miners are not honest. 
But what they fail acknowledge is that if a majority of miners isn't honest, then Bitcoin *right now* could be attacked in many different ways. 
If majority miners are honest it work just fine, because actually they will work together to ensure they don't screw up. Same as bitcoin right now. 
The rogue miner argument blithely ignores the reality that it is in the miners own self interest to play ball.


Miners make coins and are wholly dependant on the market buying them. 
The accountability of politicians to their electorate, and the accountability of legacy financial services to their customer base are not the same thing (open ledger, transparency - things not typically associated with private business, and governmental functions). Its a distraction by using bad analogy. Followed by a patronising question, designed to appeal to small minds that prefer drama over actual logic and reason.
Whether they work or not has no bearing on the incentive mechanism behind bitcoin, which has worked for the last 9 years to keep miners from doing any of the terrible things that people are suggesting they will suddenly start doing "because BU".

Imagine 75% of miners starts rejecting blocks bigger than 300kb.
You can accept and relay 1MB blocks all you like, you can accept and relay transactions on that chain all you like. The 75% hash rate is going to build a stronger chain.
If I'm with those 300kb guys I can send a transaction to them, and they will mine it.
Your node can't do anything about that: I don't care what your node thinks, the miners don't care what your node thinks. We'll just ignore you. (see:  )
So you can disagree all you like. Your non-mining node can't *do* anything about it.

Which nodes? How many of them? and how do they actually *demonstrate* they accepted it?
The only nodes that can show they accept a block are miners, because they demonstrate their acceptance by mining on top of it. It's not nit picking that miners are nodes, its the original meaning of "nodes" as in full-nodes (before that term became conflated with non-mining nodes), as in the ones that control the network. Understandably people have become confused and don't realise that a non-mining node is not the same as a mining node, because the former cannot *express* acceptance, therefore plays no part in forming consensus.


Like I said, you can't actually stop it from happening. Your reply seems it be an implicit acceptance of that.
You can't *actually* slow it down all that much either. Misbehaving nodes stop talking to each other. The network will re-organise itself. Business will be very much as usual.
As for miners? It's mutually beneficial for them to relay blocks directly. Things like Fast Relay, Falcon, FIBRE etc


Like I said, you can't actually stop them. Again your reply seems it be an implicit acceptance of that, because you are saying the "won't". 
Your reason makes no sense thought, If they believe theirs is the one true chain, and they are getting coins on that chain, how is the block reward getting "lost" to them. In actually fact, its any miner pointing their has at the other chain that is losing the block reward, because they are getting coins on a chain that has been orphaned.
 
But, we've moved from "non-mining nodes being able to dictate consensus" to "miner incentives". 
This is a totally different subject, and one that actually can have a meaningful effect on consensus, because those incentives are what keep the miners in check. 
Your non-mining node's refusal to accept a block doesn't incentivise miners. The miners serve the market, because only the market can strongly incentivise miners to mine one chain or another by assigning value to that chain by buying its coins.
@_date: 2017-02-20 11:12:56
The funnest!
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:37:11
A candidate block that does not fit the current consensus mined correctly gets orphaned, and thats your example of how a majority hash-rate fork will fail. I don't even think *you* believe that's the same thing. 
The orphaning process happens because miners did not accept the oversize block and continued working on the current block tip. They then produced a different candidate block. The other miners accepted this candidate block and started to build on that. Once a second block was found this chain was longer.
Thus the oversize block was orphaned and Ver's pool switched to mining on the (now longest/strongest) chain.
Setting aside the fact that's entirely different from how things would unfold if a majority of miners thought that block was fine. Your non-mining node had zero say in that process. Much like it will have zero say if that larger block had been accepted by the other miners, and they had decided to build on top of that one.
Miners running BU aren't going to just start mining bigger blocks in earnest whilst they have a minority hashrate.
So describing a scenario where they do shows incredibly frail understanding of whats going on. I don't think you want to understand, because I think you are already convinced that anything that challenges what you believe is propaganda, or shilling or whatever else it takes to rationalise it away.
If you just want to kid yourself that your non-mining node is all powerful and slag off BU because you don't like it, then go ahead and have the last word.

I'm not even sure I see what you are getting at. Lets take hard forks and consensus rules out of the equation.
If chain A is at block height 100 (A and two miners publish a block, you have chain A and B
Which is bitcoin? Neither? both?
If during a net split miners on A mined 1 block and miners on B mined 2 Blocks. We have A and B
Clearly right now Bitcoin is chain B. People on one side of the netsplit would agree. People on the other side though would think Bitcoin is chain A.
The net split is over everyone on A suddenly realises that B is longer. Then everyone agrees that actually B is Bitcoin.
What happens if the netsplit is pretty bad, lasts for a few hours. On one side of it there is 25% of the hashrate, and during the netsplit there is huge rally. Chain B has a whole bunch of transactions, that are economically very significant.
Chain A has tootled along blissfully unaware. Then B rejoins and must re-org, because A mined 3 times as many blocks whilst they were gone, miners on B see this and must re-org to A. However the cost of doing so is huge?
Which is bitcoin? Technically. It's the longest chain. What are the users that though it was 'B' going to do though?
I don't have answers to that. My take though, from a purist point of view though, is that Bitcoin is the longest chain. Caveat emptor.


That wouldn't be very nice. It's hardly something I should be afraid of though. Like I posted somewhere else, if in the unlikely event there is 2 chains on the go, I better see that transaction on both of them, or no dice.
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:01:19
I think that is a good thing, because by doing so you are contributing to the concrete valuation of one chain or another. The net result of which is that the chain that prevails has categorically demonstrated its value in the market place, over the other chain. 
That is the kind of confidence that bull markets love!
FWIW: I will just HODL, because I think whatever happens the above paragraph is likely to be much more important to me than trying to guess which side might win.

Choose between doing exactly what I say, or getting nothing. Is not choice it is "force" note the quotes, intended to display that whilst you are not literally being forced you are in fact being given no real choice in the matter.


So yes, it is disingenuous to say "nobody is forcing you" becuase, you are actually under threat of being ignored, causing direct financial loss.


The block was mined because of a bug, the network orphaned it. News at 11.


What I said was bitcoin works because miners are honest. I didn't say you have to trust them. I didn't say miners should have any more power. Understand that what BU provides is a transparent way for miners to signal intent. The same thing can be achieved by miners all agreeing behind closed doors that they are going to switch at a particular block height. That's not transparent, and doesn't seem philosophically aligned with the notion of a public ledger.
Has it crossed your mind though, that if miners don't have something like BU then eventually there may be overwhelming pressure for them to do exactly this. Then we have a much higher risk of economic / mining disparity.

In a HF scenario both miners and users can influence the outcome. If the chain forks users vote by assigning value to the most desirable chain. If a HF reverts. The chain re-orgs the integrity of the blockchain is maintained. Speculators might lose some money. 
In a SF scenario. Only the miners decide. The market has no voice other than categorically rejecting bitcoin. The 5% minority fork is hardly viable. Should miners revert SW for whatever reason the blockchain is left with cruft. Suggestion is a HF would be necessary to clean up the mess.

You assert there is a mining cartel. This is not proven. Through your whole post you vilify miners repeating this assertion that they are a cartel.
You apply mutually assured destruction selectively. You suggest that big holders will automatically sell down a chain where miners go rogue. MAD equally ensures that any leftover POW fork is sold down if the majority actually supports the miners. Free market at work!
In your last point you say that everything can be done by SF but don't seem to acknowledge that the very same MAD you said keeps miners in check also keeps devs in check. Indeed if they "fool around" then their code will be forked off.

I agree, nothing is set in stone and its always the miners. So creating alternative implementations does nothing. Only if miners choose a different implementation does something happen.
The only thing we have is faith that the economic majority will act in its own best interest. With classic those participants can now decide whether it is in their best interest to increase the blocksize.

So in a hypothetical BU fork the market has a choice between buying:
**1. Core coins**
75% of miners have rejected them. The remaining miners are producing a 1MB block every 40 mins. Congestions is through the roof, fees? I dare not hazard a guess.
**2. BU Coins**
75% of miners support them. Blocks are being produced every 13-14 mins, but are now 2MB (who knows maybe more). 
Thats if the mining ratio stays the same. In just over 2 weeks, the 75% of BU miners get an income bump of around 30% more BU coin as difficulty readjusts and blocks go back to ~10mins.
Meanwhile on core coin miners are still receiving core coins at the same rate and have another 4-5 weeks to wait before their retarget.
There is no choice! 
Most users don't give a damn about this argument and will judge by the utility of each chain. 
As for order books. Speculators will trade *anything* you can be sure that both coins trade wildly whilst they have their 'fun'. Thinking either one will crash and burn whilst ever there is hash seems incredibly naive. 
You seem blinded to the pragmatic outlook that is most likely to be held by the majority of users that bitcoin needs to "just work" to be valuable. You seem to think that everyone shares your crusade to villify Ver. That anyone who supports BU is some follower of the cult of Ver. That there is no real demand for BU in the market. I think you ought to open your eyes, for your own sakes!

As I recall there is a study that was done on children to ascertain cognitive development. The study found there is strong correlation between age and ability to choose deferred gratification.
In a simple situation such as $50 now vs $100 tomorrow then in the absence of external factors the rational choice is easy. So I am surprised that you said "most people take the $50" because I don see haw that can be explained by impulsivity alone. I would question whether in fact it was more to do with the belief that they would actually get the $100 tomorrow.
As the complexity of the scenario increases the number of unknown variables ensures that it is almost impossible to objectively dictate the most rational course of action.
In the face of unknown variables the most rational course of action is actually to base a decision on known facts. Unknown information can be considered but has to be weighed differently.
A 2MB increase would allow for a 100% increase in throughput from the current situation, and as you point out thats 300k more than segwit. I think thats a red herring though. 1.7 or 2MB doesn't matter ( the 300k difference is incidental). What is important is that the network was not designed to be constrained by an artificial limit. Any such limit was in fact itself the *unnecessary kludge*. A temporary fix put in place to work around a situation. I refuse to say that it is being used as a political spear because that cannot be factually established.
The transaction throughput problem only exists if you think that the limit was intended to limit transactions. There is wide discussion on this topic which I am sure you are aware of some parts of the discussion can be considered factual. Though I apprecaite you might disgree.
The 1MB limit was a temporary fix to limit DOS attacks. It was never intended to limit traffic and so the current *transaction throughput* problem has arisen because the limit has not been removed in time for growth to continue uninterrupted. The solution is to remove the limit. 
Before doing this we have to be sure that the reasons why the limit existed have been addressed. The stated reasons have been studied, and mitigated. The system should be allowed to continue growing as it has, unencumbered until such time as there is strong evidence that it cannot. That was how it was designed to operate. Without central control, with absolute reliance on natural  market forces to keep all players in check.
Segwit as a solution to the *transaction throughput* problem relies on the premise that transaction throughput is artificially limited. More specifically that this is the intentional operating mode of the system. Something that is in no way reflected in the whitepaper or the majority of the historical discussion. 
It is true now that there are some members of the core team that do believe this should be the case. Whilst they are entitled to their opinion I respectfully disagree with them. Circumstance are such that these people do have significant power over bitcoin as a whole. This power is a weak point in bitcoin right now imho. Spontaneous "reorg" of development to me would be a massive breakthrough in terms of the ecosystem demonstrating resilience to centralisation in any form. I am not "anti-core" ("core" is huge how could you be anti all of them?). I am pro choice and I think right now the gears of consensus are stuck, I think once they are unstuck the bitcoin machine will be unstoppable.
So, to me it looks like Segwit is being sold as a solution to a transaction throughput problem that is actively being curated, through the out-and-out refusal to simply remove the 1MB temporary fix. (Replace it with 2MB if it makes people feel safe, but remember thats just as awkward a kludge!)
Remove the limit the problem goes away. When such a simple solution exists to a problem, it is natural to question why the problem is not being addressed.
Selling segwit as an upgrade to transaction throughput seems disingenuous. What segwit appears to do is seperate signature data from transaction data and then price the two things differently. This does not appear to be directly connected to the issue of transaction throughput. If segwit split transaction data and signature data and did nothing else then you could say it did so for the reason of fitting more transactions in a block, but it doesn't do that - why? Why does it price these two things differently? 
I have heard "Cheaper Fees!" Who doeasnt want cheaper fees right? It sounds like a sales pitch though because its not cheaper fees its differently calculated fees. In any case Cheaper Fees contradicts the notion of a fee market, which is one of the justifications not to raise the block limit!? This doeasnt make sense to me so again I question why?
Surely the protocol should be agnostic in these matters and leave fee discovery to miners. How doeas pricing transaction data/witness data *automatically* lead to cheaper fees. The cost per byte of the in block data will just rise to the new equilibrium.
Then there is the amorphous "lays the groundwork for even greater improvements". I assume this is eextending the scripting language. The "benefit" here is that you can softfork everything. Why would you want that? Hardorks and consensus are central to the incentive mechanism that keeps participants honest?
Then there is malleability. Who can argue with that! We all remeber big bad scary MtGox right?
So what we have is an (IP?)Bill being pushed through parliament to feed the starving children of Africa (transaction throughput) because terrorists (malleability). Attached to it is a there is this subclause that the food crates can also carry other stuff that isnt food and we wont charge for that so its a cheaper way to send stuff to africa(actual segwit purpose). Then in the small print on the back page in a footnote it says we have the right to retrospectively use this legislation to automatucally bring in any other legislation we choose without having to go through parliamentary process (other improvements!).
OK the above paragraph is a satrical commentary and not to be taken seriously. It illustrates how the peons on the ground feel though. We want or $50 because it feels like the $100 that is being offered tomorrow isnt tomorrow its some unspecified date in the future, and actually between now and then its unclear what $100 will actually buy you, and also you need to sign this other agreement here....
In that situation taking the $50 now is not impulsive, its the most rational decision given the currently available information.
I am not arguing that segwit has no merit. I'm saying lets cross that bridge next, and fix the glaringly obvious issue that right now there is a barrier to natural growth in place that *will* be hit. 
Remove the limit.

your fee calc is wrong. you can't just multiply satoshis per byte by transaction size, fee is 1000*floor(1+size)
You say 10sat/byte is the attack threshold implying transactions with a fee above that are legitimate. The link you provide shows there is currently a 20k+ backlog of transactions with a fee higher than this.
What you should look at is what adding capacity does to mitigate the attack:
Based on a quick eyeball of recently mined blocks, lets say 1MB is about 2k transactions.
144 blocks/day
288k transactions a day
10 sats/byte is 10k sats per transaction. 0.0001BTC * 288k = 28.8BTC day
With 2MB blocks its $11k a day to fill that extra meg.
Even if you factor in say a 20% discount to the attack to account for the fact some blocks are empty, you still end up with an attacker having to pay significantly more to keep up the attack.

In a SF with 95% activation the 95% refers to miner support. Once the miners decide that its activated its activated. Users can choose not to use it but don't confuse this with users collectively having any choice over whether "this is bitcoin". There is no user recourse to the decision that miners made. Your node will relay the SWSF transactions it just doesn't understand them.
Whereas with a HF there is an opportunity for users to devalue a chain which they consider undesirable. A rational miner will mine the most valuable chain. Value is assigned by users buying/selling coins on any given chain.
SF removes this opportunity by ensuring an alternative chain is not viable because it has no hash left to mine it. 
People think SF is better because they still believe non mining nodes are important to the network. 
Non mining nodes are only important to their owners.

Whilst BU might to be the best solution, I don't think it is clear what is. I think the market is paralysed because like you say, without a means to do so in code, a rational miner will prefer the status quo over mining a bigger block. 
Where SegWit fails is it doesn't fix this paralysis, which is why offering it up as a solution to blocksize is doomed to fail. The very fact that "SW is a blocksize increase" nodes justifying should be a an indicator that the market doeasnt really think it is. If it did, it would have jumped at it.
The BU client directly address the paralysis in the marketplace. It does so visibly and simply. People tend to prefer simple solutions over complex ones. As a result BU is appealing (not to all, granted) and the market - in spite of the huge network effect to the contrary - seems to be moving in that direction. Again another huge sign that the market perceives that something is wrong with SegWit (not that something *is* necessarily wrong.)
The problem with software dev is that sometimes you have to give users what they want just to shut them up so you can get on with making what is best ;) you'll probably disagree but a 2MB hardfork before any of this kicked off would have bought you i) time and ii) huge amounts of trust. 


I'm thinking you are referring to the work that organofcorti did on supermajority? 
If so then considering 69% is 50:50 in *worst case scenario*
Then in a worst case scenario 75% is still &gt;50%. As this is a majority rational actors are likely to converge.
I think its important to consider worst case, but I think its also important not to confuse this with what is likely to happen. Especially as the behaviour of the bitcoin network is largely probabilistic.
So yes, in a worst case scenario the split is closer to 50/50 (but still a majority). However the most likely scenario is that its closer to 75% which presents an extremely compelling proposition to rational actors to converge.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:38:00
So first 75% of hashrate needs to signal BU. Then there needs to be a bigger block, then this chain needs to stay the longest chain long enough that the rest of the miners accept it. Then at least a third of the hashrate supporting bigger blocks needs to flip back to the 1MB chain. Then that chain needs to catch back up and overtake the &gt;1MB block chain.
You are asking us to believe that those flip-flopping miners think that this is the most economically rational course of action? Not only that but that *they can get away with doing it more than once*.
Its a fantasy constructed to try and convince those that don't know better that there is some terrible risk.

I totally get where you are coming from. However what is being confused is the intent of the attacker, and the intent of the rest of the system.
The attacker can use the median block attack to trigger the fork, but because the majority of miners have it in their best interests to shut down the attack they will.
If they don't its because the majority aren't acting rationally, and in that scenario "Median EB attack" is just one of many ways in which bitcoin (BU or Core) could be taken down. 
Its worth knowing about so miners are prepared to mitigate it, but its not an attack that *requires* a technical solution, because it doesn't compromise the fundamental aspect that "more money can be made by being honest" part of bitcoin.

It's reasonable to assume that sure. But exploring it leads to so many questions...

Is that enough to keep the chain viable until a re-org?

@_date: 2016-01-29 23:33:54
more speculation about me and why I might think certain things, I'm really not worth all that effort! ;)
I think block stream probably does not have any nefarious agenda. I think (on the whole) people who wants small block believe that is what is best for bitcoin, I think (on the whole) that people who want an increase in the blocksize limit believe that is what is best for bitcoin.
I can read the LN paper I can accept at face value everything it says, but its so complicated that I can't know for sure, I just have to trust it will. So I tie up my bitcoins and pray. Like I do in bank. You are right it is not literally a financial institution.
What I do know is that the LN paper describes a counterparty trustless solution for LN transactions. You and I can set up a payment channel and do multiple LN transactions. None of which requires third party trust.
Resolved LN *transactions* are trustless
The LN paper states early on that everyone setting up channels to each other does nothing for scalability.
The paper goes on to describe the evolution of the lighting *network* which is to say that they explicitly describe a network of nodes that get paid fees. They draw comparisons to the T1 network.
This is the business case for LN imho. I am not entirely against that (if it does happen to be Blockstream's agenda then it is not nefarious it is simply investor driven. who doesn't act in their own best interests?), I think current model is unsustainable(unscalable?). The bitcoin white paper implied all nodes were miners, which of course is no longer a reality. Miners had a financial incentive to build and relay blocks. Nodes can't build blocks so get no reward, and therefore have no real financial incentive to relay them. This becomes worse over time as the cost of running full node goes up. So I get Back et al's concern over centralisation of nodes.
With this new found revenue stream I'd be one of the first to switch off my nodes and fire up a LN node! I'm probably not the only one. So maybe we'd end up with thousands of LN nodes instead of bitcoin 'non mining' nodes. All getting paid. The network lives, BTC scales, LN nodes get paid everyone is happy. (Miners might feel a bit put out that LN is skimming fees, but of course by then on chain transaction fees are sky high because of imposed scarcity. It probably balances though so...)
Except now there are all these off-chain transactions. Everything is happening on the lightning network, the only people that really know whats up are the individual nodes involved in a particular payment channel from Person A to B.
Transactions require the trust of all participants, through the threat of penalty.
Whereas simply sending bitcoin from A to B is truly trustless.
So I'm not ignorant, I'm just thinking about different things than you are.
If you rewind a bit and instead of forcing high on chain fees by restricting supply, you open up on chain and LN to free market forces then I think that is better all around. It might be a slightly different fee distribution amongst miners and LN nodes though.

A transaction is seen by all miners (unless you are doing something funky) and so the chances are it is in the next block on either chain.
For the majority, everything behaves as normal, the main risk of a re-org is to miners who may end up losing block rewards if their block are orphaned off.

There is no proof that Segwit is objectively better for *increasing transaction throughput*
In this regard Segwit is inferior because it is more complicated, is a dangerous soft fork that silently breaks full nodes that do not upgrade.
In the case where there is an obvious and simple solution to a problem, and someone argues strongly against doing that thing, I have to conclude that person is not interested in solving the problem at hand.

Let's say that you convince enough of the economy that BU is the enemy. You are able to convince the markets to force the miners to stick with core. You are able force SegWit with UASF, and then you can finally have done with the bitcoin consensus mechanism altogether. Replaced with the all new Core "Suggested" Consensus. Much more democratic - "the majority want it" you can tell them to think.
Do you honestly think that through that entire process you will be able to maintain the illusion that nothing untoward is going on?
You have mobilised support by creating an enemy in BU. This enemy has become too viable though (why? Ask yourself? It's not for want of being vilified!). Now you have a difficult problem.
You have to both kill BU and at the same time invent a new "enemy" against which you can continue to wage your "war on terror". Without one, your angry mob has no vent for their ire. They might turn their rage towards you at which point any facade you were maintaining will be easily breached. In that regard, I think this go around things aren't working so well for you. SegWit stalled, you are running out of time.
The world has changed Jonny. The old ways don't work. Too much information is freely available, and people are waking up. You can keep spinning and tweaking "the message" and some will be convinced. Others will seek the truth. The truth is usually simple and doesn't need much narrating, and is very powerful. You can try papering over it, but you can't kill the truth.
Wrt to this "rebellion" against core. You cut off one head, seven more spring up in its place. You killed XT. Classic rose up. You kill BU, and something else will take its place. There's no shady entity behind this, there are just people who ask questions and don't like the answers (or lack of them) and so strive for something newer, better, truer.
Bitcoin is emergent. As the current stewards you are just shepherding it through its inevitable evolutionary path. You can dress it up however you like but ultimately bitcoin will grow up and leave home and you'll be sat wondering why it never calls. 
Nakamoto consensus solved the big puzzle, how to guarantee trust. He did it by flipping our genitically encoded behaviour on its head. He mad bitcoin strongest when every individual was at their most selfish. Pure genius and you do not even recognise it. Instead you and your ilk keep trying to "fix" it. Cat's out of the bag. You can't put it back in however much you try. The fact that so much has been said to try and change this shows how much of a problem it is for some. It's beautifully elegant, it empowers the whole ecosystem, and that thought is terrifying to anyone who cannot comprehend true decentralisation.
To say bitcoin is "centralised" because Chinese miners is, as well as being xenophobic, to deny the importance of users. It reveals a fundamentally flawed understanding of bitcoin. An understanding that bitcoin can be "controlled" by miners, and if that is the case then maybe "if we can control the miners, we can control bitcoin".
No Jonny, you can't, no*one* can, because everyone controls bitcoin by doing exactly what is best for themselves. So when they do, and that doesn't match what *you* want, don't cry "altcoin" because it will just confirm everything that I said. That you don't "get" bitcoin.

This will be caused by a massive influx of new users unaware of, or uninterested in the likelihood of bubble burst. They will come once the current run-up goes exponential.

Non mining businesses have a zero risk strategy, namely to support any and all chains. They are not exposed to potential loss of earnings this way.
Whereas choosing a side immediately exposes them to HF risks, without any concomitant reward.
Anyone that thinks business are going to expose themselves to additional risk for no good reason, don't really understand why businesses exist in the first place. In many cases fiduciary duty creates a legal obligation that would compel them to choose the former.
Economic majority is a distraction. Business are fickle, any "commitment" from them is good only until they decide otherwise.

The example you give is sound. Something provable such as that is definitely errata. That example does not automatically legitimise other points.
The white paper uses the term node. There is no such distinction between mining-node and non-mining node that your link asserts. The term 'miner' is never used in the paper (save in the context of gold miner), because there is no distinction. If a node chooses not to mine, then it chooses not to take part in the consensus mechanism (c12):


If a node does not mine it explicitly gives up its ability to express acceptance of valid blocks. 
This is critical because the cost of running a node that mines is orders of magnitude higher than the cost of running a node that does not mine. It is these substantial costs, and the potential rewards that combine to create the incentives (c6):








Non-mining nodes are no longer subject to the incentives (cost/reward) that drive miners. Without incentive there is no reasonable expectation of nodes acting 'honestly' (i.e. as compelled by rational self interest of a miner subject to those incentives).
The machinery of bitcoin is operated by miners. The miner-incentives are provided but the value of the good the provide to the market.
This has been the case since the beginning, and provided the incentive mechanism works correctly, any attempt to change this should be rejected by the network.

If a pending re-org back to the 1MB chain was due to shenanigans, I think there would be a concerted effort to provide users with an easy way to protect themselves.
To try and manipulate a re-org in such a fashion though, would cast huge doubt over the credibility of those attempting such a thing. Further devaluing that chain in the eyes of any rational actor.
Howver, the outlandish sequence of events described by gavin above happened as a result of free market economics.  People should be very careful to explore *why* it happened. There would probably have to be a very good reason. If there was a very good reason it happened then why wouldn't people go with the re-org? Why would they cling to a relic, against there own best financial interests?
It's exact same reasoning that applies if BU activates at 75%. A rational actor should always follow the longer chain.

Those millions of dollars of worth of bitcoin opposed sound very grand but they don't seem very statistically significant if you scratch the surface:
Take for instance these 4 votes 
I thought it was strange that the numbers were exactly identical, so I looked deeper...
They are the net result of:
- 1 person for: 12q4Ysn7RaxMUsa8gzyvPxyCV9bJpiftuQ	156.09465421 Ƀ
- 1 person against: 1LtrEDMGKV81vf8eGYYz4c7u6A8936YgDM	4600.09923500 Ƀ
A sample size of 2 addresses out of ~400,000 (per blockchain) or 0.00075%
A sample size of ~4756 bitcoin out of 15,141,000 or 0.03% 
Investigating some of the other issues on there we see clusters of votes from addresses that are all related (some to the addresses above), most of them can be tracked back to a single address that once had 20k in it.
I agree that it is likely there are many people that are against hard forks, i think its also likely that some of that fear comes from the drama (internets will internet) 
So what you said is factually correct, there are millions of dollars of bitcoin against the hard fork, but you seem to conflate that with the many people who are opposed.
It wasn't clear to me whether you thought the people were opposed to blocksize hardforks (BSHFs) because of the controversy, or whether people were opposed because really aggressive BSHFs radically change the character of the system.
I think it has to be the former (which I would agree with) because if it is the latter then you would have to assume that everyone agreed on what the 'character of the system' was and that a really aggressive BSFH changes this.
Do you think that segwit changes the character of the system? On the face of it, it seems that it silently changes nodes to 'psuedo-SPV' wrt to segwit transactions. As it is the job of nodes to validate transactions wouldn't you consider this to be a failure? When we must fail, we must do so as soon as possible and loudly (as I am sure you are very aware!)
I don't think its a bad idea to have lite nodes that don't necessarily validate sig data, but shouldn't that be a conscious decision?

EB stands for excessive block - this parameter defines what size block you consider excessive.
The other parameter that works with this is AD (acceptance depth) - this parameter defines how many blocks need to have been mined on top of a block bigger than your EB value, for you to accept it.
e.g lets say your EB is 1 and your AD is 6
This means that if someone mines a block that is larger than 1MB you will not work on it immediately and will continue to work on the previous block.
However if other miners build on top of that block such that it is the longest chain and there are "AD" blocks on top of the larger block. Then you will accept that this chain is now valid because the larger block is deep enough in the chain.
@_date: 2016-03-09 00:19:59


I asserted that 2MB blocks increase throughput, you asserted Segwit was better.
I refuted that in terms of *transaction throughput* there is no proof it is objectively better.
Telling me it is better at some other thing because of something unrelated to transaction throughput is diversion from your original claim that it's about transaction throughput.
On that count Segwit is inferior, based on the very reasonable view that it is an over engineered solution to a simple problem.
The fact that Segwit solves other problems may mean it is a good solution to those other problems. It remains a worse solution to the stated goal of increasing transaction throughput. Which can trivially be solved right now with a simple increase.

The point is that your subsequent assertion is pure fantasy, the steaming irony being that in itself it is propaganda.
Bitcoin is not capitalistic, or democratic. Read the white paper. Bitcoin is defined by nodes. Nodes means miners, in the white paper there is no distinction between nodes that mine and nodes that don't. Those non-mining miners are a phenomenon that has arisen due astronomical difficulty. The nodes help latency, but its the miners that build the blockchain.

They aren't even doing that (stopping anonymity) in any real meaningful way. They get one shot at the conversion point, once the value of the exchanged fiat is in the bitcoin ecosystem it becomes unniatributable. The only way to find out who owns it is if they transfer back out. The goal should be to never have to leave BTC. That way you have your anonymity (technically: pseudonymity).

If miners all have different EB's then it might be possible for someone to publish a block that half the miners accept and work on. The other half don't accept it and keep working on the previous block.
When the chains re-converge the block rewards that miners claimed on the 'losing side' would be nullified.
The solution:
As this primarily affects miners they would look to make sure that EB settings could not be exploited this way by synchronising their changes.
The attack has been described as


The actual implications (as opposed to hyperbole) are:
Miners that do not act quickly to rejoin the majority may lose mining revenue. 
Transactions that are broadcast to the network during this time will be seen by all miners and put into blocks both sides of the chain, such that any re-org will have little to no effect on most users.

As I recall there is a study that was done on children to ascertain cognitive development. The study found there is strong correlation between age and ability to choose deferred gratification.
In a simple situation such as $50 now vs $100 tomorrow then in the absence of external factors the rational choice is easy. So I am surprised that you said "most people take the $50" because I don see haw that can be explained by impulsivity alone. I would question whether in fact it was more to do with the belief that they would actually get the $100 tomorrow.
As the complexity of the scenario increases the number of unknown variables ensures that it is almost impossible to objectively dictate the most rational course of action.
In the face of unknown variables the most rational course of action is actually to base a decision on known facts. Unknown information can be considered but has to be weighed differently.
A 2MB increase would allow for a 100% increase in throughput from the current situation, and as you point out thats 300k more than segwit. I think thats a red herring though. 1.7 or 2MB doesn't matter ( the 300k difference is incidental). What is important is that the network was not designed to be constrained by an artificial limit. Any such limit was in fact itself the *unnecessary kludge*. A temporary fix put in place to work around a situation. I refuse to say that it is being used as a political spear because that cannot be factually established.
The transaction throughput problem only exists if you think that the limit was intended to limit transactions. There is wide discussion on this topic which I am sure you are aware of some parts of the discussion can be considered factual. Though I apprecaite you might disgree.
The 1MB limit was a temporary fix to limit DOS attacks. It was never intended to limit traffic and so the current *transaction throughput* problem has arisen because the limit has not been removed in time for growth to continue uninterrupted. The solution is to remove the limit. 
Before doing this we have to be sure that the reasons why the limit existed have been addressed. The stated reasons have been studied, and mitigated. The system should be allowed to continue growing as it has, unencumbered until such time as there is strong evidence that it cannot. That was how it was designed to operate. Without central control, with absolute reliance on natural  market forces to keep all players in check.
Segwit as a solution to the *transaction throughput* problem relies on the premise that transaction throughput is artificially limited. More specifically that this is the intentional operating mode of the system. Something that is in no way reflected in the whitepaper or the majority of the historical discussion. 
It is true now that there are some members of the core team that do believe this should be the case. Whilst they are entitled to their opinion I respectfully disagree with them. Circumstance are such that these people do have significant power over bitcoin as a whole. This power is a weak point in bitcoin right now imho. Spontaneous "reorg" of development to me would be a massive breakthrough in terms of the ecosystem demonstrating resilience to centralisation in any form. I am not "anti-core" ("core" is huge how could you be anti all of them?). I am pro choice and I think right now the gears of consensus are stuck, I think once they are unstuck the bitcoin machine will be unstoppable.
So, to me it looks like Segwit is being sold as a solution to a transaction throughput problem that is actively being curated, through the out-and-out refusal to simply remove the 1MB temporary fix. (Replace it with 2MB if it makes people feel safe, but remember thats just as awkward a kludge!)
Remove the limit the problem goes away. When such a simple solution exists to a problem, it is natural to question why the problem is not being addressed.
Selling segwit as an upgrade to transaction throughput seems disingenuous. What segwit appears to do is seperate signature data from transaction data and then price the two things differently. This does not appear to be directly connected to the issue of transaction throughput. If segwit split transaction data and signature data and did nothing else then you could say it did so for the reason of fitting more transactions in a block, but it doesn't do that - why? Why does it price these two things differently? 
I have heard "Cheaper Fees!" Who doeasnt want cheaper fees right? It sounds like a sales pitch though because its not cheaper fees its differently calculated fees. In any case Cheaper Fees contradicts the notion of a fee market, which is one of the justifications not to raise the block limit!? This doeasnt make sense to me so again I question why?
Surely the protocol should be agnostic in these matters and leave fee discovery to miners. How doeas pricing transaction data/witness data *automatically* lead to cheaper fees. The cost per byte of the in block data will just rise to the new equilibrium.
Then there is the amorphous "lays the groundwork for even greater improvements". I assume this is eextending the scripting language. The "benefit" here is that you can softfork everything. Why would you want that? Hardorks and consensus are central to the incentive mechanism that keeps participants honest?
Then there is malleability. Who can argue with that! We all remeber big bad scary MtGox right?
So what we have is an (IP?)Bill being pushed through parliament to feed the starving children of Africa (transaction throughput) because terrorists (malleability). Attached to it is a there is this subclause that the food crates can also carry other stuff that isnt food and we wont charge for that so its a cheaper way to send stuff to africa(actual segwit purpose). Then in the small print on the back page in a footnote it says we have the right to retrospectively use this legislation to automatucally bring in any other legislation we choose without having to go through parliamentary process (other improvements!).
OK the above paragraph is a satrical commentary and not to be taken seriously. It illustrates how the peons on the ground feel though. We want or $50 because it feels like the $100 that is being offered tomorrow isnt tomorrow its some unspecified date in the future, and actually between now and then its unclear what $100 will actually buy you, and also you need to sign this other agreement here....
In that situation taking the $50 now is not impulsive, its the most rational decision given the currently available information.
I am not arguing that segwit has no merit. I'm saying lets cross that bridge next, and fix the glaringly obvious issue that right now there is a barrier to natural growth in place that *will* be hit. 
Remove the limit.

It boils down to whether you believe A or B. There are a raft of attacks that are possible if most people don't act in their own self interest. Whilst it may be possible to provide a technical solution to every one of them, I think having to do so will be the proof that the bitcoin based on emergent consensus as a result of rational selfishness doesn't work.

The flip side is it can't be guaranteed to be 'anonymous' either.
Nothing stops you telling all your buddies you are publishing a BIP ahead of time, such that once its up they all know it's yours and vote for it.
Could work if the subsequent "support" for a proposal was also anonymised. Then obvs that needs protection from gaming. You'd have to have either proof of coin, or proof of work!

Lets say due to constant growth in transaction rates we are pushing the limit of 32mb blocks on 2021 at the next but one halving when the block reward drops to 6.25BTC.
Lets say each transaction is paying ~10k satoshi in fees. 
That would be 6.4BTC in fees per block.
Double it from segwit, factor in the bandwidth reduction due to Extreme Thinblocks. Even if *nothing* else is implemented in the next 5 years this is a very feasible scenario imho.
The incentive to mine empty blocks just keeps dropping.

Imagine if you will, that at block 500,000 - 75% of blocks are being mined by BU and they are all signalling EB1/AD16
At block 504,032 miners (understanding the Median EB attack risk) all set EB=2mb and blockmaxsize=2mb
A 2mb block appears, 75% are all working on it. Bitcoin now has 2MB blocks.
I think in that scenario there is no attack vector, and that EB was used to raise the block size?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:14:37
I'm not sure what you are getting it. You publish a transaction, all miners see it whichever chain they are on. It doesn't matter if the chain re-orgs, your transaction was seen by miners on both sides and is already in the re-org blocks (unless you are doing something funky)

The idea that a HF is irresponsible, needs planning etc is conjecture IMHO. It seems to be based around the idea that people won't move quickly enough, and therefore could end up negatively impacted by such an event.
This seems entirely backwards to me. The ecosystem participants are hugely incentives by these potential negative effects. So much so that they are incredibly unlikely *not* to be prepared.
A HF cannot happen (math) unless enough people &gt;51% are ready. This isn't going to happen overnight. Instead what you are likely to see is steady growth, with the odd jump as pool's move. When miners and the market see that a HF might be on the cards then they will prepare for the eventuality, because a rational miner will not want to lose money. A rational exchange will not want to lose money. A rational user will not want to lose money. The more money they have (e.g. power within the ecosystem) the less likely they are to be left lagging.
"Honeybadger don't give a shit" as they say!
My second point is that I sense a repeated theme that Bitcoin as a whole needs planning, and managing. I find this absolutely at odds with the underlying design put forth in the white paper. That is that the system is self governing, self managing. It is more like living organism than it is like an engineered machine. The consensus mechanism itself is emergent (i.e. it doeasnt need a &lt;insert perecntage&gt; pre-consensus) it either forks and the market back it, or it forks the market kills the fork and it goes back. It's almost darwinian. Survival of the fittest. The more I think about what Satoshi invented the more I am absolutely amazed at its beautiful simplicity.
So I would ask you to consider that perhaps the truth is that Hard Forks are not the threat that many think they are. That in fact Soft Forks are more dangerous because they allow miners to decide, without recourse from the market (users).
I have said nothing of BU, I have said nothing of SegWit, because I don't think they are the issue. I think the most important thing right now is that people understand the consensus model of bitcoin. I wish BU had the benefit of Core involvement to peer review and refine its code. I wish SegWit had been released as a Hard Fork, so that the miners could choose it safe in the knowledge that the Market had the power to back them (if the node count *is* anything to go by they would).
Unfortunately I think miners are afraid of soft forks and also of spinoff development teams.

Thats true, he never *said* it (AFAIK), just wrote it down and published it.


If segwit was a HF then miners would either choose to or not choose to run it. If the SWHF chain was stronger, then thats the new consensus.

You assume that the miners are selling Bitcoin Cash as they mine it.
Perhaps they see a future where in fact Bitcoin Cash becomes the main chain, because the BTC chain failed due to escalating fees, backlogs and loss of user confidence.
Perhaps then they are just accumulating Bitcoin Cash tokens, knowing full well that if such an exodus occurs, a chunk value will inevitably go to Bitcoin Cash.
They are getting pretty good odds right now. If I was a miner, I'd do it. Think about your own best interests. Act accordingly.

You can do that, but you'll probably need to convince the market to come with you if you want your version to have any value.

What does the non-mining node network do without miners?
@_date: 2017-01-20 14:27:32
Yes I agree the term "full node" has been somewhat hijacked, which confuses the argument. (I try and use the term non-mining node thesedays)
Non-mining nodes exist only to serve the person whom owns it, so that they can be sure they have a  trusted entry point into the bitcoin network. So whilst a non mining node can refuse to propagate transactions/blocks because it deems them invalid it cannot enforce anything on anyone else.
Miners on the other hand can. The fear is that because of this miners are running the show. However the incentive for them to do the right thing is strong with Nakamoto consensus, because there is a financial reward associated with being on the strongest/most valuable chain. 
Its self fulfilling in that respect. So the idealogical few can continue on the weaker chain, but they have to go against their own best interest financially to do so.
I don't think its dangerous, I think its more dangerous to have a Soft Fork, that is decided by miners alone. There is no way for end users tp 'punish' them if they do something undesirable, other then bailing out of XBT altogether into the next best alt. I don't want to see that happen, my money is all on this horse (or rollercoaster if you prefer!)

You can't know which fork to reward or punish, you can only choose based on your own preference. If part of your decision is to be based on the state of each fork then you ought look at the state of each fork.


AFAIK if you ask a node for an old block it will send it. Whether it be a mining node or a non-mining node.

You said miners were acting irrationally. I gave you a potential explanation for their behaviour. An explanation that suggests they are being perfectly rational.
To clarify: mining empty blocks on BTC actively affects the success_modifier. If that's what they are doing.
Of course they have always mined empty blocks so maybe it's just business as usual.

In a 5% mining the weak chain scenario its all but guaranteed that chain is virtually worthless compared to the strongest chain.

It is opt-in, but I think all that does is give the illusion of choice. In the fullness of time that option dies as everyone starts using SW addresses. A HF just removes the warm fuzzy preamble :)
I think the argument that BU code is objectively worse than Core code is shaky. BU is mostly Core. Core devs themselves have said that the bitcoin code is "bad" and needs a lot of work. I'm not working on wither fork so couldn't comment, but I think its fairer to assume that both teams have great minds. 
Whats tricky with SW is that it does so many things that it is a hard to make a binary decision about it being good or not. There are things it does that are unquestionably good. There are things it does that are probably good. There are things that it does that might not be good.
Unfortunately because its all or nothing the decision is much more difficult.
I think the reason the miners are taking so long is because they are the ones who have most at stake. I can spin up a node for whatever version I like with virtually zero consequences. As a company I can state one thing or another with no immediate material consequence.
Miners don't have that luxury. Miner's don't *act* as if they are making decisions, they do in fact have to decide what to run. It's not as simple as looking at the node count and deciding whats best for a bunch of non-profits (i.e. non mining nodes) is the same as what is best for us.
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:14:58


OP: ..Small minds discuss people...
My primary reason for not supporting SegWit is that it is being done by soft fork. I believe that soft forks undermine Nakamoto consensus because soft for activation is controlled entirely by miners, and the market/users have no recourse.
In a HF, then as soon as the chain splits, the market has a say in which chain prevails by arbitrage. Thus there is an incentive for miners to do the Right Thing(TM).
That is why I support alternative implementations that use Nakamoto consensus as a means to decide future development of the protocol. It is self balancing, and in fact is working exactly as intended, as it has for the entire history of bitcoin.

To this day I am still waiting for someone to explain to me how non-mining nodes have any non-nogligable bearing on the network.
Miners extend the chain they wish. If this creates a fork then the market (users) reward/punish.
Non-mining nodes are no part of Bitcoin's incentive mechanism.
@_date: 2017-01-28 00:07:41


When the reasons you give amount to negligible effects on the network, then dismissing those effects as negligible is just confirmation of fact.
If I can give a solid reason why non-mining nodes are of benefit *to the user that owns them* then that just shows that I understand what their purpose is.
They can relay transactions, or can refuse them. They can relay blocks, or refuse to. They can enforce whatever rules they like in the owners backyard.
None of this can materially affect the functioning of the wider network. Its painfully obvious.
WRT miners sharing old blocks? The answer is "the incentive mechanism".

If a miner is incentivised to do something because it is in their own best interests to do so. That is not an attack, that is the bitcoin incentive mechanism working exactly how it was explained back in 2009.
That you feel it is an attack is because you have already decided that bitcoin should be what you want it to be. It doesn't owe anybody anything, it does what it will. It is evolving right now, what you are seeing is the painful transition as it casts of the shackles that have been holding it back for nearly two years now.

That is like saying the idea that the world is round is seriously flawed because some people say it is flat.

@_date: 2017-01-19 16:00:27
Everything is possible but where is the incentive? It's not really a viable attack because if you've got enough hashrate to publish a block then the most profitable thing to do is publish blocks that won't be orphaned. (Which is exactly the point why people won't publish massive blocks, because even if it's valid to do so, the chance of it being orphaned increases with the amount of time it takes to propagate.) 
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:38:39
I remember key people using the "adversarial mindset" line of reasoning for justifying all manner of things, that should or should not be done.
A lot of these were very esoteric and hypothetical, complex attacks by dishonest miners... (it was always the miners strangely!)
I think there was some implicit assumption of control over the codebase. If you think nothing better will ever come along, then you are blinded to the adversarial conditions that might arise if it did.
I think that shows a deep lack of understanding of how bitcoin works in a socio-economic context. This aspect of bitcoin has often been overlooked, and now the price of that will be paid by those that did not consider, or understand it.
If the market (in particular hash rate) moves significantly, it is horrible for bitcoin.
Yet this simple, adversarial scenario, was never considered by any of the core dev team. Or at least, was never acted on?
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:08:56
Bitcoin cash is a defensive fork. It gives those who do not want segwit and opportunity to continue a on chain unencumbered by said.

I'm asserting your node has no effect on the network. I'm not asserting your node isn't useful *to you* in establishing the state of the network. 
I'm saying the "incentive mechanism" because I think you know what that means, without me having to explain it, because I assumed you knew how bitcoin worked.
In summary, the miners do the mining. The market values what they do because bitcoin can be exchanged for goods, services and/or other currency.
Bitcoin is valuable because miners do the right thing. If miners do the wrong thing then the market will no longer value bitcoin.
Given that miners are paid *in bitcoin* it is in their best interest to ensure that they don't do things that devalue bitcoin.

"[miners] vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
They are the mechanics. The non mining nodes can't work on "extending them" because they have no "CPU power" [hashrate]. 
What's clear is I haven't "taken the liberty..." because i understand that what constitutes a valid block is defined by the process above. Whereas you are attempting to shoehorn the opinion of non mining nodes into that mechanism. In doing so you don't actually explain how that would work you just assert that it always has been like that with some hand waving about "observing the current network topography" 
Yes non mining nodes relay blocks and transactions so they are part of the topography. If they see blocks/ transactions they don't like they won't relay them. The mining nodes don't actually *need* them (e.g. FIBRE).
What stops miners is their profit motive. Miners create coins. The protestations of non mining nodes is nothing compared to their mined coins having less market value.
@_date: 2017-01-27 10:21:30
I can't argue with anything you have said about software upgrades. I want to know why I am wrong about a HF not needing planning (I accept miners upgrading needs planning - this applies equally to HF/SF).
A hard fork is not a software upgrade.
The software upgrade is applied by individual miners. A hard fork is something that happens as a result of a super majority of hashpower implementing a different set of rules.
So in a scenario where a HF has occurred and the software upgrade is  subsequently found to be faulty in some way, then the miners may decide that it is better rollback. In which case they would start mining on the old chain again (because they would see the new as invalid) and eventually the old chain would become longer. (A reorg)
Thats a really bad place to be in I agree.
What is not clear is why a SF is preferable? In a 95% scenario, then activation would occur when the hashrate was sufficient. There is - all things being equal - just as much likelihood for this upgrade to be faulty.
Rolling back SWSF avoids a reorg. However the SW transactions are now seen as anyone can spend.
If SW as a HF was rolled back, its still a mess but I think its cleaner. If I sent a SW transaction to someone in return for good/services. Then there is a clear remedy, and potential recourse.
If I sent a SW transaction to someone that becomes anyone can spend, and someone else does spend it. Its incredibly hard to remedy.
Also nodes (assuming you mean the non-mining kind) don't need to upgrade. The network works fine just slightly less efficiently without them. The primary purpose of a node is to benefit the owner in having a trusted gateway to the network.
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:25:10
They lost bitcoins, because they mined a block that was orphaned.
At the point you have mined a block you have more bitcoin (coinbase + fees)
If your block gets orphaned then those bitcoin you though you had, they are no longer yours.
This is not 'fake news' is just what happened. (DISCLAIMER: I haven't actually fired up a node and checked the state of the blockchain myself, I am trusting the various sources of blockchain information. The financial motivation is minimal. I don't need my own node to argue on reddit.)

@_date: 2017-01-19 08:23:40
It matters incredibly because: 




Requires a high activation threshold, to mitigate the risk of a reorg to an "anyone can spend" scenario.
The most important point though is that there is no way for the market (users) to reject a "soft fork" because there is no other chain to arbitrage. Using node count as a proxy for what users want is not accurate, it can be gamed with resources that represent a tiny fraction of the value of the whole market. 
Whereas in the allegedly "dangerous" HF situation the miners are incentivised by the full weight of the market into converging. This cannot be gamed by spinning up a few VPS.
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:14:57
Play it out a little, imagine there is &gt;51% of hash accepting this block.
Now, all the lets call them "goodnodes" that don't like it banned the other nodes lets call them "badnodes"?
All the "badnodes" that do like that block banned all the "goodnodes"?
Is it true that a network split would thus be quite clean, because nodes drop peers that don't agree and instead go looking for peers that do?

@_date: 2017-01-21 16:21:02
If it needs to be rolled back then all SW transactions become anyone can spend. Therefore you want to be very sure before activating.
A HF doeasnt require pre-consensus. Consensus is established by the HF (or lack thereof). Wherever the the market goes, the miners go.
So there is an incentive mechanism in place that ensures miners are kept in check by users. Namely that a HF that is undesirable would be sold off and miners on it would lose money. The other chain would increase in value rewarding the miners that were acting in the interests of the userbase.
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:17:25
Au contraire, Blackadder...
Why was it orphaned? Because other miners decided to ignore it and mine upon the prior block. Thus establishing its validity - until that point the block was neither valid nor invalid. It was merely a block that one miner was broadcasting.
Are you saying the block was 'invalid' before consensus establishes it to be so?
Consensus is an emergent property, why else was the block orphaned?

dollars/hash * success_modifier = profit
on BTC chain the succes_modifier has always been ~1 as there has never been any viable alternative to put your hashrate
now success_modifier is &lt; 1 b/c there is a viable alternative, its exact value depends on whether you think there is a chance that the market will lose faith in BTC
the same formula exists for BCC until this resolves one way or another you will see hash move back and forth depending on what that particular miners values for "success_modifier" are for the respective chains, and how that affects the profitability calc

You are correct that it is a risk calculation. You figure out a risk multiplier for each coin. 0 if you think it will definitely fail, and 1 if you think it will definitely succeed.
Then its simply:
Value of BTC * risk multiplier for BTC
Value of Bitcoin Cash * risk multiplier for BCC
That tells you what do with your hashrate to maximise EV.
For a long time the risk multiplier for BTC was ~1 and for anything else was ~0.

You can choose not to believe people when they tell you why they think segwit is not a good solution to the blocksize issue.
That isn't them *demonstrating* they aren't interested in on chain scaling. Its simply that you think they aren't. Which is bizarre because have to do some very convoluted thinking to reason that people wanting bigger blocks don't want on chain scaling. 
Bigger blocks means more transactions on chain. It's axiomatic!

Miners are nodes. So the statement "no miners = no bitcoin" is true.

@_date: 2016-11-29 09:42:01
Miners (nodes) have all the power in their hand with regards deciding which is the longest chain. Check the white paper.
Choosing not to mine, means choosing to have no say on which block is mined on next.
These 'full-nodes' you speak of are not 'nodes' as referenced in the white paper, but are wallets. You can vote with your wallet in that you can choose to ignore the longest chain, but you can't directly affect anything. Only nodes as defined in the white paper (i.e. miners) have a say.

@_date: 2017-01-25 18:09:19
agreed the longer it goes on the more attractive off chain products look, which is great for business if your model is to try and sell people off chain products...
@_date: 2016-11-29 12:52:51
I understand very clearly. Assuming I don't is a mistake.
To extend the analogy lets introduce Carol who is a mining node. Lets also say there are 4000 of Eve.
Carol also decided she did not like block  so produces her own block  She tells Alice, Bob and all the Eves. Alice and Bob are already on block  so ignore Carol. All the Eves like Carol's block and so accept it.
Alice and Bob carry on mining blocks     and telling each other about them, Carol and all the Eves keep ignoring them, statistically speaking Carol is probably up to about 
So now you have two chains, one at block height  and one at block height 
The minority chain will continue not accepting block from the main chain, the main chain will continue to operate ignoring Carol and Eve's shorter chain.
So yes I know exactly how a minority chain can survive.
I also know that if Derek sets up a new mining operation with a huge amount of hashrate (lets say 40%) and decides to mine on Carol's chain that if Carol's chain overtakes Bob and Alices then both bob and alice will reorg.
You can't define terms as you see fit. You can't say the longer (most POW) chain is the orphan chain just because you don't like it.
You can't say non mining nodes are *needed* or can enforce anything.
The only argument you have is that node counts may be representative of the market, and as such it may be in indicator that the market will sell off Alice and Bob's coin, and buy up Carol and Dereks'.
So in reality the Miners have the power to decide the longest chain, but do not do anything that the users would not like because that would be financially irrational.
Money has power. Miners have power. Non-mining nodes are irrelevant.
Alice and Bob arent going to mine larger blocks, unless they are confident that the userbase won't sell them out.
If the userbase isn't going to sell them out that means both the money and the miners are behind larger blocks. Non miners can stick on the minority chain if they wish, but financial motivation is likely to get the better of them in the end.

My node operates under the same premise
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:11:31
Indeed, given AntPool have a history of mining Empty Blocks I'd say it was business as usual.
@_date: 2017-01-29 22:52:38
The liberty I am taking is observing that miners extend the blockchain by deciding which blocks to extend, and that validity is a derived product.
You are saying that's not how bitcoin operates. Yet here we are some half a million blocks deep and to date that is exactly how it has operated for the last 7 years
Your attempts at bamboozlement with "enforce, not decide" lacks clarity - what exactly is the difference there? By enforcing or not enforcing they are actually deciding.
Next you'll be telling me that the only people that buy coins are non-mining nodes...


Hang on, that's exactly what they do. They can express their own acceptance by choosing not to relay, but as we've already covered the consensus mechanism relies on that vote being materially cast through extending the chain.
Implicitly you agree that nodes relay things, your quarrel was with my assertion that that's *all* they did. Your justification being that in addition to what I described you state that nodes are the ones buying coins.
How do these non-mining nodes buy coins? do they work a regular 9-5 and take home a pay-check in dollars, have these nodes completed the KYC/AML regs on Coinbase to be able to do so? Have they achieved sentience and decided that Bitcoin is the best thing since sliced bread? Excuse my attempts at humour but I'm not sure how else to respond.
You are joking right? Its like claiming that credit cards buy cars. 
Nodes don't buy coins, people buy coins. If you need to buy coins in a manner that requires you to manually submit the transaction to the network then at *that* point it may or may not be useful to have a node running on the chain you are interested in. This is not the same as *nodes buying coins*.
There just isn't any mechanism by which nodes can have a material effect on the network. Painful though it may be, on this particul notion, you seem to be off the mark.
I remember this one time on BCT where we had a long discussion about the consensus mechanism and the part non-mining nodes played (or rather, didn't). At the time I was saying much the same thing as I am now, but you swore blind I was wrong. Then finally you posted something which did just enough to make me doubt myself. I believed you and thought that maybe I was wrong. This left me in a quandary, because if non-mining nodes can hold the network to ransom, then bitcoin is fatally flawed, because anyone can run a node at trivial cost.
So I went away perturbed by this and re-examined things, and it turned out the deeper I looked the more I came to understand that in fact I wasn't wrong at all. I'd been arguing about blocks, and what you'd done was trick me into thinking that nodes would prevent transactions from propagating. Turns out you were wrong about that too. I can submit a transaction directly to a miner from my node. I don't need your node or any of the other hypothetical X-thousand nodes that don't agree with me and the majority hashrate. 
Non-mining nodes that don't agree effectively drop off the strongest chain network. If there are some miners on that particular chain, then they can all carry on doing there thing. They can even call themselves Bitcoin if they like. Really if the name is whats important to you, I say you should keep it! The new chain could call itself "Bitcoin 2.0" or something.
A non-mining node is good for one thing, and that is acting as your own trusted entry point to the (a) network. The fact it may or may not relay blocks and/or transactions is a secondary and non-essential component to it. 
The only line you could take here, is that a large enough number of nodes rejecting blocks/transactions on the strongest chain could potentially hamper things. They may do this to try and devalue the stronger chain to force a reorg. Or they might just do it for the lulz. Either way its a valid concern. Of course any such attempt would be short lived because the network will just route round it. Miners already communicate directly, so the 'orphan risk' attack vector is already mitigated.
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:58:59
*HOW* does Eve enforce these things? Shout and complain? Send an angry letter to Alice telling her to stop it because its making her very cross? Tell Bob that Alice is a meanie and hope he stops talking to her?
I already explained. Alice and Bob don't need Eve. They can communicate directly with each other and anyone else that isn't listening exclusively to Eve and Carol.
If I want to transact, I can just tell Alice or Bob directly what my transaction is. 
In fact nobody needs Eve. If you want to transact you could just tell Carol.
Eve is only valuable to the person running her. You said it yourself. running a full node is for *you* to protect *yourself*.
Your node adds to the chatter, maybe even helps take the load off of mining nodes, but in the end has no real bearing on what is going on with the bitcoin network. That isn't agenda speaking. That is just how it is.
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:09:33
ELI5 how does Eve *stop* Alice and Bob.
Eve's rejection of a block has no bearing on Alice and Bob.
I can send my transaction to Alice or Bob. I can send it via my non mining node. All of this can happen whether Eve likes it or not. 
Eve cannot *enforce* anything on Alice and Bob, however much you believe it to be so.
If she could, then you would be able to tell me how.

You are quite correct I was "mentally sloppy".


The cohort that "believes" in Fiat currency is massive, hence its success and despite the historical evidence to show it is doomed to fail. Is that the groupthink you describe? because it fits.
I don't have a crystal ball, but I do try to pay attention to what is happening. The world is always changing, and with the creation of the internet the rate of change seems to be increasing. I don't know what it means with regards to 'money', maybe its nothing. If it is nothing then nothing changes. If it is something then at least I am not stuck worshipping at the alter of fiat scared and confused that my god has forsaken me.
There are cultists on both sides of the fence. Like I said before though, the point is that the one's who consider themselves on the 'right' side of the fence are vast in number. So its very easy for them to dismiss the notion that anything else out there is viable. You could say that they:


@_date: 2016-12-06 00:27:25
It boils down to whether you think it's more sustainable to keep doubling the fee or doubling the block size.
Personally I think the latter is likely to increase *economic* throughout more than the former.
It's easier to sell a 100 $0.01 widgets, than it is to sell one $1 widget. Given that the penny widget does the same thing as the dollar widget.
So in terms of miner incentive I think it's pretty clear what is best. Miners aren't daft... watch this space

If it was HF it wouldn't need an activation threshold. It lives or dies by nakamoto consensus.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:06:37
A hardfork allows the market (users) to keep miners in check using BTC built in incentive mechanism. i.e. if miners fork is undesirable that fork gets sold off, miners on the wrong side lose money.
A soft fork with 95% activation ensures that once 95% of miners decide to implement something, there is not enough hashpower left to provide a financially viable alternative, and thus no way for the market to stop miners implementing whatever they want. (Other than selling off BTC entirely).

As Gregory likes to say. "Welcome to Reddit"
Your choice of words is quite literally "choice"
Blocks aren't offered to users, they are broadcast to the network. Full nodes (aka miners) choose which block to build on, extending the longest PoW chain.
Any and all blocks in the longest PoW chain are valid. 
Your example about miners who create too many coins when broadcasting a block is factually true but critically omits the fact that it is other miners not mining on top of said block that will ensure it is orphaned and does not become part of the longest PoW chain.
Your non mining nodes can stamp there feet and refuse to relay blocks or transactions they don't like but unless that is *everybody,* longest PoW chain is always going to win because you will be routed around. Given that 10% of nodes are already off piste, your "users are in charge" hypothesis is flaky

I'm having difficulty understanding how, when jratcliff63367 explains that "Instead, people will open and close channels, not on the bitcoin network, but on sidechains (shards) of the bitcoin network." a few posts up, that you think LN is still bitcoin.
LN might be a great payment network, but it is not Bitcoin.
The logical conclusion is that if everyone wants to transact using LN without using a third party there are more transactions on the bitcoin network than if they had just transacted directly on chain. The only way LN works is if someone else is doing the channels i.e. a third party.

I'm replying to the post where you accuse an alleged cultist of not being able to challenge their belief system. As you so cleverly pointed out not every large cult is a religion. You still failed to make the connection that fiat currency bears all the hallmarks of a religion, a central object of worship, absolute faith in the god(s), a clergy above the laws of the cult. "Right" in this context means that the cultists are, by virtue of being so many in number, assured that what they believe is the absolute truth. 
Quite contrary to what you stated, the person who takes the less trodden path is by definition more able to consider alternative viewpoints, and it is the person who is entrenched in a comfortable majority that will be quicker to anger when their philosophy is challenged. 
Anecdotally, your ad-hom rant would support that view. An ad-hom rant in response to simply being told you were wrong about some facet of bitcoin that demonstrated how in some small way it was better than credit cards. Your response seems to be due to discomfort at having your beliefs called into question, further reinforced by your subsequent projection.
With regards to your call for rationality, it takes 2 to tango. A refutation has to be, in the first instance, rational. We ought to start there, and then once we have a rational refutation, we can see whether or not anyone else is rational enough to acknowledge it.
If there is no rational acknowledgement then it should be easy enough for you to discredit them and uphold your assertion.

Since day 0 full nodes have had control over which block(s) they decide to mine on top of. Thereby establishing consensus.
One of the properties of consensus is that it is established. The PoW mechanism beautifully allows it in a decentralised fashion.
Full nodes are economically incentivised to do the most profitable thing.
That means reducing orphan risk whilst maximising profits.
Money is one of the strongest motivators. Why would miners kill the goose that is laying he golden eggs?

Looking at your chart "Probability of BIP101 activation" with the dual log scale, it can be seen that 69% means it would likely trigger in a couple years, but what the chart doesnt show is that 68% would take about 10 times longer!
Similarly Probabilty of premature BIP101 activation needs 19% fake miners for activation inside a year. 1% less and again that goes up by a factor of 10.
I see what you are saying 75% isn't necessarily 75%, but to recommend the fix is to go to 95% seems somewhat out of line with what your charts show. I'm not sure if you can simply extrapolate the math but if we are ballparking at 6-7% below the 'target figure being a likely to trigger early within a year' then 95% becomes around 89% in the context of a couple years 'voting'.
Flip that around, and you are effectively saying 5-11% of miners have veto power of a switch to BIP101.
FWIW I just wnt a blocksize increase. I'm backing XT now because it's the only one in the wild at the moment. Times can change though, and I hope they do. I think competetion in this space is desirable.

BitcoinXT is just a different node implementation. It still mines/transacts bitcoin, but advertises a new protocol. Once 75% of the network supports the new protocol (+other caveats), then max block size increases. Once a larger block has been mined the implementations that don't support the larger block size will no longer be able mine/transact on the main chain.

Abstracting away the numbers isn't helping your argument. Neither is nitpicking semantics.
In 75/25 split the majority hashrate finds blocks 3 times faster. The numbers above clearly demonstrate how low the chance is that the minority hashrate can disrupt the majority (at most ~6.3% after 1 block and how after only a short space of time (a matter of hours) that chance has diminished to virtually zero.
The longer chain is the valid chain, and is bitcoin. The shorter chain is not bitcoin, its some miners mining on blocks which have all been orphaned by the majority. By any reasonable definition this constitutes "lost".
Your talk of minority interests highlights a glaring assumption that miner's faced with a rational choice of almost guaranteed loss, are for some as yet unspecified reason, going to refuse to mitigate that loss by just going with the majority.
The argument that there needs to be some other consensus before we actually have consensus as defined by the blockchain is a red herring. The consensus mechanism is built into bitcoin, complete with an automatic feedback loop that ensures that nodes (miners) that are economically rational will ensure consensus either remains the same, or rapidly moves to a new model.
Unless there is some actual proof that the existing consensus mechanism does not work (multi-billion dollar valuation and 6 years without failure are evidence that it does) then any attempt to add some other consensus layer seems redundant.
75% is not a requirement, it does not supersede nakamoto consensus. The associated risk with 75% is demonstrated clearly above in the numbers. It is up to those running pools to decide whether those numbers constitute it being "Unsafe".

miners decide. people lobby miners. etc
miners choose the rules, ergo bitcoin chooses its own destiny
@_date: 2015-08-27 18:22:56
I see. So 75% is possibly 68% over the course of a couple years whereas 95% is actually more like 94-95%. Obviously better in a 'true to advertised form' sense!
What this means though is that your 5-6% of non-XT miners can effectively block what the other 94% of miners actually want (or claim to want in the case of the Non-XT guys). 
IMHO I think its unfair to argue that XT needs such a large majority, without considering how small the minority is that gets to block it.
So to summarise - with the current "75%" implementation then BIP101/XT is likely to activate with around &gt;68% support.
This means that only 32%+ of miners need to not mine  BIP101 blocks to ensure the status quo. It's a 2:1 advantage in their favour - I'd say its not entirely unfair? Though there is that whole argument about 'its not a democracy' though!

100% correct. Anyone that tries to tell you anything else needs to:

@_date: 2016-02-10 21:20:56
Many is such a vague word, since you have written a program that tells you quite accurately what the number is you could use the actual numbers...
Instead you appear to be arguing about how bad you *think* it is for miners based on your own personal interpretation, I am just posting the actual numbers.
In the example I ran for N=2 there were 6270 occasions where the minority chain managed to orphan a block. It looks like many, but only if you ignore the fact that it is 6270 out of 100,000.
So ~6.3% chance that a block is orphaned. If we ballpark that 75% of hash power is made up of about 5 miners theres about a 1% chance that a miner loses a single block, before reversion to the mean.
For N=3  its ~2.3%
For N=4 its ~1.1% 
Lets not forget for this hypothetical loss to occur you have to have 25% of hashrate "sticking it to the man" with the inverse probability of being on the losing chain for each value of N.
I don't see how you can argue the that majority of the miners should be scared of being orphaned, whereas the minority should ignore all reason to the contrary and continue mining with overwhelming odds they are working against their own financial best interest.
Its a bit of a stretch to be honest.

There is a chunk of speculation in there, and I'm just your average illiterate human so there will be times when I don't quite articulate exactly what I mean but hopefully the gist gets across ok! The more paranoiac rantings are due to my fear of the misuse of tech (grew up in 80's under the niggling threat of nuclear war :/ ). 
I don't think its an unreasonable fear, given the history of mankind to date! I try not to let that emotion drive my entire thought process, but I can't rule it out either :)
I think its great that this technology (LN) is being developed, I think there are totally great uses for it. Your description of peaceful co-existance of LN and on-chain is very reasonable, and I think it will (hopefully) be the natural outcome. I would love that outcome.
Bitcoin has grown. It now represents real money/power, with a potential for much more on both counts. Something like that is going to be awfully attractive to people who crave money/power. I wonder how long it will be before the kind of people that crave money/power try to claim bitcoin as there own? I'd say it was almost inevitable.

Yes bitcoin is capitalistic.
I didn't understand your post because I didn't realise that you were responding specifically to me saying it isn't.
I made a mistake saying "Bitcoin is not capitalistic", I think I was still focused on the idea that the bitcoin holdings of a few people on bitcoinocracy were a way of measuring opposition to a hard fork. Given that that was factually demonstrable thing I had assumed that was what you were talking about when you said "there is opposed to a contentious hard fork a lot of real capital"
I then foolishly assumed that by "capitalistic" that's what you meant. 
So when you said a node is capital I could not discern how a node was connected the holdings of these people that had voted on bitcoinocracy. So that's why it made no sense to me. I see now that in your earlier post the capital in opposition to a hard fork was in fact  the miners. 
Sorry for accusing you of posting a non-sequitur when I can see now that it was a perfectly valid point. 
A node (mining) does indeed represent capital.

Let us inspect those "Old Wins:" further...
(I have never written a line of python before today so forgive any kludginess)
    import random
    
    original_fork_hashpower = .25
    original_fork_length = 0
    new_fork_length = 1
    
    old_win_lengths = [0] * 100
    
    old_wins = 0
    new_wins = 0
    
    def get_next_block_winner():
      global original_fork_hashpower
      global new_fork_length
      global original_fork_length
      if random.random() &gt; original_fork_hashpower:
        new_fork_length+= 1
      else:
        original_fork_length+= 1
    
    while old_wins + new_wins &lt; 100000:
      while new_fork_length &gt;= original_fork_length and new_fork_length - original_fork_length &lt; 100 and new_fork_length &lt; 1000000:
        get_next_block_winner()
    
      if new_fork_length - original_fork_length &gt;= 100:
        new_wins+= 1
      elif original_fork_length &gt; new_fork_length:
        old_win_lengths[original_fork_length] += 1
        old_wins += 1
      else:
        print "Tie"
      original_fork_length = 0
      new_fork_length = 1
    
    print "N,F"
    for i in range(len(old_win_lengths)):
      print str(i) + "," + str(old_win_lengths[i])
We're now taking a look at just exactly when the old chain manages to orphan the new chain, in a 25/75 split
I think it demonstrates that simply counting the chance of it happening in 100,000 runs misses the important detail of *when* it would happen, which is right at the heart of the often cited '6 confirmations'.
The chance of the small chain orphaning after those 6 confirmations is approx 0.5%

Thank you Meni for highlighting the most important part of the whole debate.
Whilst I may be pro "big block" I absolutely accept that what I or others might want has no bearing on what bitcoin is. Only bitcoin itself can choose its destiny.
@_date: 2016-02-12 18:07:57
I quite agree every version of bitcoin that has ever existed imposes the blockchain rules. Core, btcd, bitcoinj, classic, unlimited and even XT bless its little cotton socks (other clients are available).
The corollary is that the "blockchain rules" are what the prevailing version of bitcoin defines. 
Sometimes the blockchain rules in one version of bitcoin are different to the blockchain rules in another version. Whilst ever blocks are mined that are not considered invalid by other clients then everyone mines on the same chain. If one client mines a block that another version considers to be invalid then at this point there are two versions of the bitcoin blockchain that differ only in respect to this one block.
At this point one cannot say what *is* bitcoin. Strictly speaking its the longer chain, but it really depends on which version has the most hashing power as to how things play out. 
You don't need me to tell you (I'll remind everyone else though ;) ) that for short while in 2013 v0.8 redefined bitcoin. An without intervention this chain would have continued to grow and would *be* bitcoin. However the community agreed that it was undesirable, there was sufficient incentive for the miners to agree that reverting was the correct course of action. So in short order 0.7 became the version with the most hashrate such that it could create a longer chain. This would appear to be the autonomous enforcement of network rules in action. Firstly with regard to the majority hashrate creating a longer chain and being bitcoin, secondly with a previously orphaned chain catching up and subsequently overtaking and triggering a re-org.
In a way this inadvertent hardfork could be seen as a great demonstration that nakomoto consensus works as intended.
So the consensus mechanism built into bitcoin works. The blockchain rules are whatever the majority says they are. Nakamoto consensus takes care of what is *bitcoin* and the humans take care of trying to convince miners to choose one client over another.
So whilst humans in the system may consider themselves to be judge and jury, it is hashrate that is the executioner. 
He who controls hashrate controls bitcoin. It is an inconvenient truth for those who try to claim otherwise.
Others can influence bitcoin by proxy. Sometimes through reason and coercion sometimes with threats and bullying. I would agree with you that these incentives are an important part of the system.
Core controls the incentives for miners to stick with core. Classic controls the incentive for miners to switch to classic.
The miners control the hashrate.
Your though experiment is an odd one! Is it because a Raven is not a Writing desk?
Here is a though experiment for you. What if the top 10 pools (90% of hashrate) all decided that core/classic squabble meant neither dev team could be trusted and came to an agreement amongst themselves on a blocksize hard fork schedule of their own choosing?

bitcoin doesn't because you can see the blockchain, the mempool. 
In a simple A-&gt;B LN transaction that opens channel sends &amp; closes. You can see on the the blockchain what has happened.
LN literature evolves this though. There is no benefit in an A&gt;B transaction via LN. Instead LN is sold as providing many *off-chain* transactions that are then settled on chain later. 
Extrapolating this, at scale, LN becomes the primary processor of transactions, and bitcoin becomes settlement. Its no secret that this is the preferred model for some.
What is the optimal end-game for LN? A hub spoke system of channels that rarely if ever close. All transactions go through LN with very occasional (if ever?) on chain settlement. Why do the LN channel operators want this - because fees. If stuff is rarely settled of chain, and everyone uses LN all the time then really why bother with the on chain stuff at all. Why not just use LN itself. Why not issue some kind of executive order making it illegal to own bitcoin itself. Why not let LN issue its own set of tokens that represent bitcoin, and give some central authority the ability to issue these tokens in order to make sure the economy functions correctly.
Most importantly, why not accuse anyone that is against them of "promoting centralisation" or "being out to destroy bitcoin".
But thats just crazy talk :)
*If* Blockstream are building a private payment network on top of bitcoin, and *if* they want to force people to use LN for all transactions, then that kills bitcoin as an open payment network.
If I am wrong, that makes me a conspiracy theory nut job, and everyone can carry on about their business and we all get to use bitcoin &amp; LN and I'll get my coat.
If I am right then this is directly opposed to the idea that bitcoin can succeed in becoming a worldwide currency that is not controlled by anyone.
But going back to the OP. I like LN, it looks really cool. I like it as a payment network that exists on top of a bitcoin that has not been artificially constraint to *enforce* its use.

I'm not sure how you can accuse me of being vague (I don't claim to have the answer). Then state you *do* have the answer but hand wave over the detail.
A surefire indicator that you are one of the 'extremists' in the debate is throwing about absolutes like "bigger blocks don't help in any way". The only way that is true is if you define what "help" is for every other person in the ecosystem. Which is not very bitcoin. A bigger block would have helped me on several occasions.
Segwit might help other people, but it doeasn't help me. That doesn't give me license to claim it doeasn't help "in any way".
What you present as "simple incontrovertible facts" are your opinions. 
With the video without preconceived notions about what is right and you will see its actually a very balanced explanation about how every possible scaling solution could help, but could also prove to problematic if taken too far.
Moderation is what is needed. The middle ground kind, not the 検閲 kind ;)
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:08:55
The point I got was that it’s not about whether scaling is done on or off chain, but more about whether the methods (and there are likely to be many complimentary techniques) compromise the important properties of bitcoin. Decentralisation through being able to self validate on consumer level hardware is important.
Perhaps that means being able to fully validate every transaction in every block. Clearly “huge” blocks are an issue in this regard. Or perhaps that means being able that validate just those transactions that are financially important to you in some way that has not yet been figured out. Not “full (non-mining) node” and not fully trust less SPV, but something in the middle? Maybe that’s done via L2 at some point or maybe it’s done by some other wizardry with L1 (eg like how zeroconf worked with probability / risk). Now “huge” blocks aren’t such a problem...
I think that the message was about minimising both transaction costs required to use bitcoin *and* minimising the cost of resources necessary to self validate.
Both are important and neither outright trumps the other as justifying an extreme position on either side of the big block/small block debate.
Moderate action would have been infinitely preferable to what is unfolding now, imho.
Get the world on board, let the world afford it. Bitcoin was never supposed to be about just “making money”. It was supposed to be about making *a new kind of* money.

Neither solves the problem. We need both. Unlimited block size and sidechains. Without one the other cannot succeed.
@_date: 2015-11-21 15:15:29
unlimited blocks doesn't mean blocks will be infinitely big, it means they will be capped by economic feasibility and not arbitrary limits imposed by humans. Those same market economies are also what will make sidechains a compelling solution. The way I see it is imposing arbitrary limits is analogous to a central authority controlling the system whereas leaving the market to figure it out is more like the contrary. I am not saying that larger blocks doesn't have its challenges, especially with regards the hardware, but I think its better to facilitate natural evolution over what appears to be attempting to engineer the economy. I think there is enough evidence that human planning is doomed to fail, maybe we should let 'nature' have a go. Its got us this far. Its not even that those that believe in a block size limit are malicious either; “Most of the evil in this world is done by people with good intentions.”

The only way? One of the selling points of BTC is you can send money 'almost for free'. How is making it more expensive going to drive adoption?
Consider the mining reward the formula is simple:
sum(transaction_fees) = block reward
if you know the number of transactions in a block then you could figure out the mean average fee per transaction, then you could write:
average_fee * number_of_transactions = block reward
its clear that increasing *either* of these values gives a bigger block reward, but everyone is focusing on increasing average_fee and overlooking number_of_transactions
Right now you can have ~4000 transactions in a block, lets say fees are on average whatever the reference client says i.e. 0.0001 BTC so 0.4BTC in fees. Not very compelling. 
What if you have ~80000 transactions in your 20MB block, now you have 8BTC in fees and everyone is still paying small fees.
What if over time you don't limit the block size to 20MB but instead scale it over time to support more transactions. 
I get that people can no longer run a full node on a raspberry pi with a 32GB SD card, but is keeping 1MB blocks going to change this? 
Want to run a node? hook yourself up with a VPS and get cracking. I run a couple an AWS. Its super easy and relatively cheap.

I have my own opinion thanks, for example this whole thread is stupid. It's embarrassing for anyone that genuinely thinks block size increase is a good thing to be associated with this kind of logic.
A long time ago it became clear to me that the fundamental difference is that small blockers and big blockers just have a different view on the long term goals of bitcoin. 
I always thought it was digital cash, others think its this settlement, store of value thing. I happen to think they aren't mutually exclusive, but the whole debate is now characterised by people taking there idea of what they believe Bitcoin should be and using anything and everything to justify there position exclusively. It's a battle of ego and personality and the victim is bitcoin.
I am trying to not care and go back to irreverent commentary, but its very painful watching what is happening, so yeah sometimes I have the odd outburst. It's therapy.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:37:17
Lets say SW is the best thing in the world and will solve all the scaling issues. Lets say we are all on board with segwit. Lets say everyone signals for it right now.
First we have to wait for activation to lock in: 2 weeks (oh the irony!)
Then people have to move coin from a non-SW address to a SW one. To be able to segregate their witness data and start to use "non-core" block space for part of their transaction, to simulate the blocksize increase.
All the while the mempool is growing faster than it can be emptied, meaning fee market is snowballing.
The last thing *anyone* wants is "stalling", a lot of people have been abjectly against "stalling" for the longest of time. Read around, you'll see.
The whole point of a quick bump to MBS is to buy a bit more time, keep bitcoin top of the pile, and figure out exactly how to move forward, without seriously compromising decentralisation. 
UASF isn't special, it can throw its hat in the ring with everything else, and if its the best/most desired/whatever solution. It will just win. Thats the point of bitcoin, it just works.

Fee per transaction doesn't need to go up. That's the whole point!
If the number of transactions doesn't increase then you don't need &gt;1mb blocks, so you don't have competition anyway. 
If you have 1mb blocks and transactions increase, then people use side chains and the block reward from fees stays small and everyone stops mining. Why not keep those transactions (and the fees) on the Bitcoin blockchain to incentivise miners. Just like the original plan!
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:03:50
You're whole line of reasoning so far has been attempting to discredit me. Bitcoin is not just science, its economics, its human behaviour. Its like trying to predict the weather. I'm sure Nick Szabo is well aware of the difference between what he knows, and what he thinks. Like I said before his guess might be very much more educated than mine, and indeed yours. Perhaps you need to read more of his writing. He's also said blocksize does need to be increased.
Anyway, I've explained my line of reasoning as to why I think bitcoin will become more valuable if it is more useful. You can't just say "there is no founded argument" and expect anyone reading to think thats some kind of sound rebuttal. 
Bitcoin won't magically increase in value if people don't use it. Why would high value individuals use it if nobody else is.
Again what is *your* incentive to want smaller blocks?

To clarify miners are full nodes. A mining node expresses its acceptance of a block by building on top of it, extending the chain.
Whereas a non-mining node simply chooses which chain it wishes to follow for its owner by deciding which blocks it thinks are valid.
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:51:52
Two things matter: hashrate for extending a blockchain and users in their ability to exert economic incentives over the miners.
The idea that users have any direct say in the blockchain comes from a lack of understanding of how the incentive mechanism works.
It's incredibly simple, and doesn't require an army of "explainers" it is self evident.
Miners express acceptance if blocks by building on top of them. In the event there are two competing chains users sell off the one they don't want. Hashrate follows the money.
So simple anyone can understand it, and yet people still don't. Why is that?

Core,Blockstream etc wants to scale bitcoin with SegWit and off chain.  Block signalling is about 45% for this.
Jihan,Ver,BU etc  thinks bitcoin can scale on chain with blocksize increases. Block signalling is about 40% for this.
A third option has appeared asa  result of the deadlock: SegWit2x
This is Segwit with assurances of a blocksize increase as well. Many of the larger companies, and miners support this as a compromise. Block signalling about 80% for this.
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:41:53
You neglected the part where before losing 75% it tops out much *much* higher than anyone really thought it would.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:48:27
You aren't very good at this ;)
"Small blocks are essential to preserve the decentralised nature of the bitcoin network by allowing as many participants as possible to run nodes. Increasing block size creates centralisation pressure by increasing the resources necessary to run a node. Small blocks are essential for developing a robust fee market to ensure that miners are rewarded for their part in securing the network. Bitcoin is not intended for use for high volume small value transactions these are best served by L2 solutions such as LN, Side Chains etc"
I don't agree with any of it. I do understand the argument though.

@_date: 2017-07-10 11:29:20
I think you might have me at cross purposes. What I meant was that to send a SW transaction both send/receive address must be segwit. I did not mean to imply that you could not send SW coins back to a non-SW address.
For the avoidance of doubt:
Are you saying that if I send BTC from a non-segwit address to a segwit address then that transaction is treated as a segwit transaction.
i.e. the witness discount is applied to that transaction?
i.e. the witness data in that transaction is not counted towards base block size?
I understand that it only has to happen once. And from that point forward those coins can continue to benefit from the capacity increase and the witness discount.
There are 50m UTXOs, whilst I expect there is probably some decay curve of new to old addresses and most churn happens in new addresses, there are still a lot of UTXO's to move before a significant chunk of people are switched over to SW addresses.
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:01:49
So that means it won't work!? 
@_date: 2017-07-10 12:04:06
Yes, I understand that a transaction is made up of inputs and outputs. I'm simplifying when I say SW transaction. Dancing around that isn't doing you any favours. It just looks like your pedantically avoiding the fact that you can't segregate the witness unless the UTXO you are using is segwit (p2sh). Which means there must have been prior transaction which took a non SW 'compatible' UTXO and created a SW 'compatible' UTXO.
Twice you've argued against a proposition that I have not made.


I have not said that, and I am not saying that. I have elsewhere argued that SW / MBS increase are different in that: 
1. For MBS increase, capacity is instantly available for every UTXO at the point of activation.
2. For SW, the witness discount, and additional capacity through segregating witness data are not available to any UTXO at the point of activation. They only become available once a UTXO has been created that *can* be redeemed by segregating the witness. Which requires a transaction, that does not benefit from SW in terms of weight or discount.
So what I was saying in this thread, in simple terms (pedantics aside) you gotta move your coins to a SW address to be  be able to send a SW transaction.

I believe that increasing utility adds value, I don't agree that it compromises security. It's the age old argument about mining vs non mining nodes. A non mining node only helps you. A mining node helps the network. 
That said I agree that measures that did compromise security could reduce value. There's no need for it to be effectively like inflation. It's what it is, reduced utility is reduced value. 
We just disagree about the role of non mining nodes in securing the network. It usually boils down to that, and until Aug 1st when we get empirical evidence either way I don't think anyone is going to change their mind. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:50:06
Non mining nodes don't do anything for the network, they benefit the owner in that they allow the owner to be sure they have an accurate picture of the blockchain. That's the incentive to run one.

No, when I say believe, what I mean is I am not so arrogant as to assume that the prevailing view of something is necessarily correct. Just that I agree with it at this point in time. 
It invites the other person to put forward a counter argument.
My belief is based on the theory of utility, and whilst I accept that for the individual this may not always hold true, in the sense of crowd behaviour it is the most probably outcome that something more useful will be on the whole more valuable in a broad and open market.
By all means disagree. 
I wouldn't say *completely* ignorant. 6 years reading on the subject you can't help but learn a thing or two. Most important though, I am not so ignorant to understand a much deeper truth that *everyone is guessing*. Some people's guesses are just more educated than others.

You're argument implicitly dismisses any other person who develops bitcoin, researches it, understands it, invests in it, mines it and holds a different opinion about the path forward. The core dev team didn't build it, they maintain it, and that team has changed over time. They have demonstrated quite spectacularly they don't understand it as a whole. Back's solution centres in trying to govern bitcoin, whilst proclaiming very loudly that he isn't (you want to see back flips look there). It's becoming very clear that his plan won't work, and on August 1st he will once again be left scratching his head, wondering...
Suggesting I am paid to write is weaksauce. I'm a longtime user with a good understanding of bitcoin in the grand scheme sense. There are plenty others like me, and plenty with far more invested that have a much bigger direct say in what is going to happen. Hashrate is king, the market is queen. Bitcoin is both PoS and PoW.

If you do nothing you have 1BCC for every 1BTC
I just decided that it was worth swapping my BTC now for 5 times as many BCC because I think there is a possible disparity in price/value. I think the true split is closer to 50:50 and my hope is that actually BCC becomes strongest chain. So much so I was prepared to take that risk. That's how bitcoin works, everyone acts in their own self interest.
Markets often act irrationally in the short term. I bought goxcoins at 0.05 on the btc back in the day too, b/c I thought they were oversold and I figured the true value would be more like 0.1-0.2 btc. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 09:55:06
Sure increased nouber of nodes, more connections, more redundancy etc this is incidental benefit though. In a bitcoin "max-success" scenario there will be plenty of diversity from nodes run by retailers etc (and they have some incentive to run one to verify incoming transactions).
Your typical user, paid in bitcoin spending bitcoin on goods and services doesn't need to run a full node to see they have been paid, or to subsequently spend that coin. (Though of course they can if they wish!).
I appreciate these arguments assume plenty of on-chain activity, I don't think off chain would be much different though. Channel to employer, employer has channels to suppliers, who have channels to other suppliers etc facilitating P2B... still not much benefit to running a node as a regular joe. Certainly the rest of the network sees little benefit from Joe's crusty old Raspberry pi node ;)

You said (paraphrasing, correct me if my interpretation is out):

To which I replied that: I understood it wasn't a long term solution.
I said nothing against SW, I'm not arguing against any of the points you made (nor am I necessarily agreeing with every one of them).
What SW doesn't do is immediately address full blocks/mempool/fee issues, because of the friction involved during the transition. (only sw-&gt;sw transactions get a "blocksize discount")
Whereas a bump immediately makes available (n) times capacity to all transactions.

One of the central tenets of the big block argument is that blockstream want small blocks because their business model is selling off chain solutions.

I genuinely believe what I am posting I stand by what I say, my actions are consistent with my beliefs and have been for the last six years. My understating has matured but the basic philosophy has never changed. I read the white paper I saw how bitcoin would change the world and the only thing that can stop that is if somebody tries to fuck with it. Long overdue removal of a growth constraint is not fucking with it. Hacking it to pieces and siphoning off incentives is, trying to engineer around Nakamoto consensus by creating miner driven soft forks that attempt to circumvent economic incentives is. Those that think they know better are attempting to do these things, but there are those that are smart enough to know they don't and they will not let it happen. That goes for NYA just as much as SWSF. First bitmain, now nchain. A simple big block hard fork with at least 20% hash rate. It's more than enough to keep bitcoin running and growing. 
I have no fear of what is coming. I believe that Nakamoto consensus is unstoppable. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:52:28
Why are you so keen to stop *everyone* being able to use bitcoin. 
This is the "some people are more equal than others" mantra.
Bigger block size means individual transactions keep lower fees. More transactions mean miners get more total fees per block, which offsets the cost of propagating those blocks.
Restricting block size won't make people pay more. They will route around it (sidechains, alt coins) and the theoretical endgame of the miners being supported by transaction fees will not happen, because the fees are begin limited by an artificial cap in the number of transactions.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:26:56


There has never ever been anything like bitcoin ever. To say you *know* how it works is to fail to understand your own limitations.
The article is good, but it is based on the assumption that the value of bitcoin will grow. As I've already put forward, I believe bitcoin cannot grow in value without utility. I don't believe it can act as a store of value, unless it *is* valuable. I believe it is valuable because of speculation on future utility. At some point that utility must be delivered.
It's essentially a disagreement over whether bitcoin should be high volume, low fee vs low volume, high fee.
I understand from your post that you believe in the latter. I don't know why, because I don't understand what your personal economic incentive is in that scenario (your BTC are worth more?). 
I believe the former, not only because I believe it makes BTC worth more, but because it also means bitcoin can be used by many more people with many more use cases and that this makes the network security model stronger. I think this also means it can be used for settlement *as well*.

Sure. Sending for no reason doesn't mean anything. There's no incentive to do that as it costs money to send transactions. People only send transactions if they want to transfer value, and the cost of doing so is acceptable. Any increase in the amount of bitcoin being transacted must be down to an increase in the amount of value being transacted.

Before I go I will just recap on where this debate ended up, because your arguments refute themselves.
I called you out because you have repeatedly called me stupid and ignorant. You say this shows my argument to have no grounds? I have nothing to say to that.
I suggested that bitcoin was more akin to a complex system with numerous inputs such as the weather. You think this is twisted reasoning? I have nothing to say to that.
I made a point about the difference between concrete knowledge and deductive reasoning. I suggested Nick knew the difference. I also referenced that Nick had said specifically that bigger blocks will be needed. You ignored everything I said and tell me I am ignorant? I have nothing to say to that.
I've told you why I think bitcoin will become more valuable if it is more useful and that allowing more people to transact makes it more useful. Your argument was "You didn't give reasoning and there is no reasoning" and that everything will go on like it always has, even though full blocks is a condition that is new to the network? I have nothing to say to that.
I explained why I think bitcoin will not go up in value if it is no longer useful. Your reasoning is "it has in the past, so it will in the future"? I have nothing to say to that.
I ask what your incentive is to introduce an artificial fee market. You tell me you want X because you dont think Y is a good idea, and tell me I don't understand? I have nothing to say to that.

In what way is it dishonest to believe something that to be true that is actually happening. What *is* dishonest is to take your subjective opinion that "a currency can only be built because &lt;something you beleive&gt;" and present *that* as truth.

I don't know which chain will come out on top. I think its important to finally put this question to bed though.

They believe the same thing, of course they are co-operating. Like Adam, Peter, Gregg, Matt, Samson, and that pr guy all co-operate, because they believe the same thing.
Wu/Ver et al think theres more money to be made with digital cash. Adam/Greg et al think there is more money to be made with bitcoin as settlement.
It's exactly how bitcoin works, everyone acts in their own best interest, consensus emerges.

It's interesting that you have to caricature my position, then attack that.
I understand that I am not here to save bitcoin, I understood way before CSW spelled it out in the most simple terms yesterday, that bitcoin revolves around economic incentive. I know that you can't control it, I can't, Adam and Greg can't. What you are seeing play out is embarrassing naïveté on their part. They seem to truly not get the incentive part of bitcoin. (Or do but think they are smarter). They think it's all about code and crypto. In fact it's much bigger. You don't think it works because you clearly still don't get it.

A long time. Which means I didn't turn up as a result of some speculative bubble. It means I understood what bitcoin is and why it is great.
My opinion hasn't changed. Bitcoin hasn't changed. The number of schmucks who think they are smarter than satoshi has increased though.
Doesn't matter if you think Jihan is trying to control all the hashrate, if he does, everyone who doesn't want that will leave.
Doesn't matter if people think Adam is trying to create settlement coin. If he succeeds everyone who doesn't want that will leave.
I think you've forgotten how bitcoin works. Everyone acts in their own best interests. That's probably why millions of dollars that should be in bitcoin have gone into alts like ETH. *ETH* of all things, a total clusterfuck. Such Core, so mismanagement. Wow.
The only obvious thing is, that if it continues *everyone will leave*. Thats how bitcoin works.

There should not have to be an argument. All that does is reveal how SWSF did not activate on its own merit. The ecosystem rejected it.
We'll see what the ecosystem wants come August. When, i hope, we finally get the HF necessary for consensus to be established.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:37:19
If you presuppose the success criteria is forcing everyone to remain on one chain of your choosing, then yes its impossible and inherently dangerous *to you*.
My criteria for success is that nakamoto consensus is allowed to work unencumbered. That in a HF scenario, rational selfishness *ensures* success because the majority hashrate will follow the chain that the majority of users are buying in to.
I suspect this fear of some minority hash continuing on a different chain is borne out of suspicion that their chain will not be the one the market backs.
Rational actors understand they have coins on both chains, so it does not matter which chain *wins* it only matters that one of them does.
It only matters that something is done, because the paralysis is the problem. August 1st can't come soon enough. Whichever 'side' anyone is on.

I don't watch videos of Jihan, I make a basic assumption that he is out to make money and extrapolate from there. Same as ver, back, maxwell etc

Codeclimate GPA of bitcoin went from 1.46 on the 0.12 branch, down to 1.16 on the 0.13 branch.

I don't think node count is very good proxy for the sentiment of the entire community, not least for the reasons you yourself gave.
I'd look to things such as hashrate, or public support from keys with large balances. That kind of support cannot be faked.

You can make a subjective judgement, but that isn't really the same as knowing. Which was my point.
For example "disdain for core developers" may very well be because he sees their inaction around solving capacity as a threat to his business. Because he sees their actions wrt HKA as slippery. This is the opinion a rational man would come to.
If the majority wanted segwit, then they would have signalled, and it would be active. So your opinion does not seem to be reflected in reality.


@_date: 2017-06-21 02:26:03


Everything was made perfectly clear [here]( when you said


@_date: 2017-06-21 00:18:40
That's called modesty (in which ones judgement is a factor). I did say there is luck involved, but I also said that judgement is involved - you said it had nothing to do with it.
Jihan doesn't just "have a lot of money", he is the co-founder of BITMAIN which appears to be quite a successful company. That speaks about his judgement in general.
Whether or not he shares your view on bitcoin as "P2P digital gold" is of no concern to me. Whether you equate you're views on bitcoin as "P2P digital gold" as bitcoins underlying principals, is not objective fact.
You are involved in a witch hunt.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:41:58
Yes majority hash-rate defines consensus. BIP signalling shows intention and helps miners come to a decision whether consensus is to change. It's hard and messy to change consensus, and that's a feature!
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:36:52
Saying I should be able to transact on chain cheaply/easily isn't the same as saying that's the only way to do it. 
DDOS has other solutions out there, and I think a guy that can post what you did knows that. Your rhetorical question is designed to further the notion that everyone must run a non mining node which is absolutely not the case. You have displayed exactly the "we know best" attitude of so called bitcoin experts. So yes, you can't help me here, because you don't understand what bitcoin is, or how it works. You want it to be something other than what it already is. You will not succeed.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:49:27
Stop you are embarrassing yourself.
The argument seems to be that a straight up 2x throughput increase at the cost of 2x storage/bandwidth is bad because it "centralises miners" (it doesn't).
Whereas a 2x(ish) throughput increase at the cost of up to 4x storage/bandwidth is better and a compromise.

Word games. A sure sign what I said was substantially correct. I can make a transaction right now with another party and whilst everyone in the world can verify the transaction occurred they cannot say for sure who was involved. That's private and untraceable in any practical sense. 
Easy to transfer isn't necessarily a property of cash. It's a property of digital cash. Amongst other things.
Digital cash as opposed to bank settlement. That's what I want. Adam has already confirmed he wants bitcoin as settlement, which makes sense because he is CEO of a company building L2 solutions.

I understand enough about bitcoin. I'm not interested in discussing it with you. I will continue to correct any misinformation you post though.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:40:22
Bitcoin cannot store/transfer wealth if it is not valuable. It has to be usable for people to think it is valuable (or to speculate on its future value). It is useful right now as digital cash, businesses have sprung up based around this use case. Once blocks got full its utility was reduced because it became to expensive to use. Transaction value has now dropped off. Money went into alts.
Back is pushing bitcoin as a settlement layer, but what he seems to be ignoring, is that forcing it to be settlement *only*, you force all the users that gave it value to date off-chain. It doesn't make any sense that have fought so strongly against any kind of MBS increase.


Segwit also increases the blocksize. Those aren't even arguments anymore. You should know better.
MBS gives instant capacity. Segwit, not so much.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:08:31
thinking node count is a good measure. lol.
@_date: 2017-07-05 12:48:12


If that was the case segwit would have activated, it hasn't. It may yet do so, but making blanket statements like that just fans the flames.

Innocent until proven guilty. What bitcoins? I don't have any bitcoins? Oh those ones I got from bitstamp yeah I sold them a while back, never made a profit. Etc 
The only thing KYC/AML at the exchanges  does is prove who bought coins the first time around. Once they move, all the chain analysis in the world can't prove that I have the keys to a different address. The end game is all the money stays in bitcoin and never ever goes through the fiat/btc gateway again. Imagine that.
Adam's view of bitcoin is easily understood from what he writes. He wants settlement *to the exclusion* of bitcoin as digital cash. I want fast, low cost, fungible, deflationary, decentralized (no authority controls *anything* - I don't like NYA SW2x it's a trap, but the market does what the market does). My view does not preclude bitcoin from being "settlement" capable. It can do both, and fears of it being too big to handle show either remarkable lack of vision and insight into how things work, or another agenda is at play. Things adapt, the network would adapt, bitcoin models nature. It will adapt.
Denotation isn't defining something as a subset of its properties such that it suits your argument. 
If you are being accurate about definitions then it's not increasing the blocksize, it's removing the temporary ddos cap. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:40:07
asicboost was discovered *after* segwit was developed therefore "stopping asicboost" cannot be the reason segwit was developed.
before segwit was developed, nobody was calling for it. if the community wanted segwit it would have activated. it didn't.
segwit2x will have the same mountain to climb, more likely UASF will cause the UAHF to come into play, and we finally get some market based resolution instead of all this speculation.
wrt to "reasonable" blockchain size, if 4mb is ok for segwit, then 4mb is ok for MBS increase, not that it has any significant bearing on "decentralisation". Decentralisation is about no single entity being in control. 


the current reasoning from segwit proponents centres around incentives to reduce the UTXO set &amp; fixing transaction malleability

If the premise was false you would have a point, but what we have established so far is that you think that adoption is not hamstrung because the price per bitcoin has gone up, and because the cost of transacting has gone up.
In turn I pointed out other measures would support my argument. For example the reduction in the number of transactions being submitted, the (not insignificant) flow of wealth away from bitcoin into alts.
Your argument is weak sauce. The premise is not false. You just don't like it.

So segwit uses up to 400% more bandwidth/storage to provide a 200%+/-100% increase in throughput. That relies on the UTXO set having been moved to segwit addresses, which must be done via non segwit transactions.
The only compromise here is that miners and users have let this go on for so long.

Second layer is inevitable, but it makes no sense to me to hamstring adoption right now by not just simply letting it grow. (Ostensibly to create more demand for a second layer, so maybe it's someone else that doesn't think L2 is feasible? or dare I say profitable?)
Yes we might have to double it a few times before other tech comes along that obviates the need, but there is only so much wizardry you can do. In a worldwide adoption scenario, the blockchain is just going to be massive, however magical the code. If the technology isn't up to it, then *that* will be the limiting factor.
You mention the need to be trustless. I agree that you must have the option for it to be absolutely trustless, but I recognise there are degrees of trust. If I'm buying/selling a house for bitcoin, I'm going to want a full node of my own to be sure. If I'm buying a coffee then an SPV wallet is just fine for me (bring back zeroconf! ;) ). In between, I think there will be layers. I think the same things can be said about privacy. I might want the option to be able to transact from a to b without traversing LN. Who knows what 
So calling MBS "not a scaling solution" or "kicking the can down the road" is fine, but (imho) it is the simplest way to get the job done and should have been done in good time to avoid the absolute dogs dinner of a situation we are in now. 
The arguments about why we shouldn't do a MBS have never added up for me. The way the whole thing has unfolded, something seems off. Perhaps I am the one being bamboozled, but I feel strangely calm about the whole situation. I don't think bitcoin can be stopped, because it plays so well off the human condition. It taps into the 'selfish gene' and channels it to control the whole system. I think any attempts to co-opt bitcoin (be that the miners, the entrepreneurs, or the VC startup(s)) will fail because the rest of the system will reject it, and route around it. Just like the internet. Bitcoin is so much more than the sum of its parts.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:21:25
"Incentives" How very vague and non-specific.
Decentralisation (mining) is about no one specific entity controlling the majority hashrate. 
A concrete incentive as a result of this is that users will not value a coin that is centralised. Miners know this, and so the most rational course of action is to ensure they do not allow this to happen.

It's probably nothing more than the boomerang effect. Cost of transacting went through the roof so people just stopped "buying". Takes a little while for the effect of that to be seen. As fees revert, I'd guess transaction rate will increase again. Basic supply/demand...
