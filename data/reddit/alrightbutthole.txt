Can you explain more what those hostile forces would be? In my novice understanding of Bitcoin, one of the foundations of my knowledge is that it's naturally resistant to threats BECAUSE it's decentralized. 
Do you mean a threat like a mining group becoming so prominent that they control the majority of all mining involved?
The consensus you're talking about comes directly from something decentralized, from individuals making individual decisions that affect the whole. 
I still don't see why anyone would WANT a centralized group advocating for, or controlling BTC. My non-programmer gut instinct tells me that it's best to let things evolve naturally rather than trying to force consensus from a centralized governing body. 
What am I missing?
Edit: "saboteurs from the inside" requires there to be an "inside" which there currently is not. Although there certainly will be the moment a governing body is established.

I agree that this is true, but isn’t that what we’re trying to resist with this whole crypto thing?  Seems like the commenter I responded to is actually in favor of centralization. It was just just a simple statement of fact.

This guy gets it.

Jesus. In the same post you're shitting on libertarians who appreciate the individualistic nature of crypto (as if that's not one of the very founding principles from the BTC whitepaper), while advocating for centralization and a BTC governing body. 
Everything you just said is horrifying. You don't understand this one bit.

Not if I sell high. Think about it.

Sometimes I keep coins and tokens on binance because I’m lazy and they handle forks pretty well. 
How stupid am I?
