Good for you. Now let everybody else decide for themselves.
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:30:05
Nifty idea, you know, I never even TOUGHT of clicking on it.. Bravo!
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:10:23
All I can say is, Nice try :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:37:39
the question is : how low will it go?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:58:45
Nice :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:35:07
My thought exactly. We'll see in a few days/weeks..
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:34:55
Good for you :) I did the exact same thing, got verified in 4 hours, money deposited in another 4 hours. I like VoS
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:51:12
Yep, 705/3133/2948. This does not look good.

You sir/madam, are on your way to become filthy rich. Just a couple of hundred years more and who knows? you might be able to buy a bag of chips.

Hi, I read the letter earlier and was really impressed with the honesty, straightforwardness you showed.
I am currently looking into a poker-funded-in-btc option and I immediately said to myself : This is it. I am trying this tonight. 
But, I am from canada (heh). And based on your AMA, we are not allowed to play on your tables, is this still true?
So, if that is still the case, I will continue to look for other options, leaving my shattered hope behind.
Thank you,

Enfin un peu de couverture Bitcoin en francais, ici a montréal. Bravo Métro!
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:31:07
Dont worry. my deposit took just over 4 hours to arrive. My guess it that they are dealing with a lot of incoming volume. It`ll come, in time.

From the sidebar : Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:33:32
Nice :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:27:10
Oh dont worry, I looked, recovered the old wallet file, and it was completely empty :( I wished.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:23:21
Ok, you had me really puzzled there :) 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:39:58
We used to be able to deposit cash into a BMO directly into their account, and within a few hours, you could buy bitcoins on their exchange. But this option is gone now, we are still waiting for another solution to come up. Apparently they were supposed to add Bill Payment, but this is not yet implemented.
Also, they were supposed to add CAD transactions a few weeks ago (more than 1 month?), still nothing there as well.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:36:18
Wow, 50$ worth? Did you deposit it there or did you get tipped for this amount?
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:49:54
I ran into the same question myself, living close to montreal. After many days of research, I can say that the best and most affordable way to get bitcoin is to open an account with [Vaultofsatoshi.com]( It will require that you send some information (picture ID + proof or residence) to get your account verified, but it will generaly take less than 1 day to get approved. After that, you can deposit money into a BMO account (at the counter).
Quickbt.com does have interac, but it does not support all the banks in canada.
Localbitcoins.com is praised here on reddit, but the prices in canada are mostly much higher than actual value.
cavirtex.com offers many payment options, but I hear their transaction fees are too high compared to others, plus yout account can take a few days to get approved if not longer.
Hope this helps :)

My best advice : Dont. Waste of money/time/electricity. Unless you can compete with mega-data centers mining at the moment, you would only get fractions or cents a day, at best, if you are lucky.
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:46:04
Haha, right. Give you my user and pass.. right..
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:07:57
Hold on, i`ll give you my great great grandson`s future e-mail address so you can contact them.. :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:29:15
Right, I`ll keep that in mind after my first bitcoin is purchased :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:35:50
Stop posting this over and over, I have seen it appear  and get deleted 4 times, just today.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:22:57
I bought originally at 1040$, panic sold at 925$ ( I know I know ). But I bought back at 750$. I believe in bitcoin and I know it will come out of this stronger than before..
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:58:23
I was solo mining , did not research it at all bedore jumping in, should've looked into it a little more back then :(
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:09:02
Ok, thanx.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:40:25
Calm down, if you dont like the post, downvote and ignore. You dont need to reply to everything everybody writes screaming profanity at everyone.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:35:14
Well, here goes :) Back in 2011, when I first heard about bitcoins, I was immediately interested and installed the mining software, created a wallet, etc. I let it run for a few hours, but seeing that it was taxing my computer so much, and I wanted to play a game at the moment, I stopped the miner, and never started it again, forgetting about it. 
This was the most "expensive" Mass Effect 2 game ever. :(
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:56:53
Nah I just uninstalled the miner after a few hours , seeing that i made 0$.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:47:05
Hmm maybe but my guess is 725$ there seems to be strong support for 800$ at the moment, so it seems like a good opportunity to invest
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:31:11
Woot free bitcoins! Upvote
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:15:11
1 BTC in only a week? what kind of rig are you running it on??
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:07:15
Well, the current orders on VoS are at anywhere from 100$ to 3000$, but there are a lot at 1000$, so if you add them up, you would be able to reach your desired total. But it may require some patience. It is known that VoS is still new-ish and is growing. 
But overall, the quality of the customer service, the ease of account verification and simple deposit process makes it MY current best choice.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:09:58
Oh wow :) nice little tool, had no idea that existed. Thanx alot!
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:05:37
I am using VoS, but I did not give them my bank account information, I deposited in cash at a BMO, back when it was possible to do so.
