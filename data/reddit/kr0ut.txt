I transferred 31 Litecoin from Poloniex to GDAX 4.5 days ago and it still hasn't arrived. Idk wtf is going on with Coinbase and GDAX but it feels fishy AF.
Edit: just received my coins! Ironically enough I got them just 30 minutes after emailing them again stating that I believed they were holding my coins against my consent, along with many others, in order to restrict the supply and manipulate the price. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:14:33
This is a really great reply! Thank you for the perspective, I appreciate it a lot. 
I'm definitely more of an active, and not passive, "investor." I'm not really attracted to IRA stuff, but the restaurant franchise bit seems really cool.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:11:39
What people are failing to understand in this classic "us against them" (republican/democrat, BTC/BCH) is that early Bitcoin holders already won, even if price continues to fall (likely because of those early holders selling). 
Everyone who owned BTC got free BCH... in fact,  a shit ton of free hardfork coins... so, despite how cunty Ver is, he won, because he owned a shit ton of Bitcoin, made millions, and then doubled those many  millions in the BCH split, and then made even more millions passing BCH off as real BTC and watching the price climb on Coinbase. 
Everyone is busy fighting over BTC vs. BCH and you're all fucking idiots. He fucking won. They all won.
But nobody won as hard as Satoshi. He owns a million Bitcoin, a million Bitcoin Cash, a million Bitcoin Gold, Unlimited, god, Segwit, Segwit2x, Silver, Uranium, Diamond, Lightning, Super, Cash Plus, Atom, Platinum, etc. etc. etc. 
BTC could literally keep going down in value and the early holders can still make money by creating a thousand forks...

That's great! I'm glad you're in to the crypto club in general. It's an awesome place where unimaginable things happen.
I hope you're "up" there in 6 months too! But if you are, I'll likely be up to the 500k level.
Which is why I'm looking for some similar perspective. It's really tough making these big decisions. I made two times my yearly salary last month. It all hurts my head

Interesting. I'll believe you. Just fascinating you believed enough in the cause to adopt it before practically anyone else, and then just tossed it to the side. I'm sure you made profit, but in the months and years following you never turned the miner back on or reinvested? That's interesting. Better coins don't mean much when Bitcoin has the marketing. The word Bitcoin is all that most people know about crypto. It's the grandfather of them all. Despite "better," people are dumb, and you're a little dumb to not understand that and capitalize on it.

Haha, I'm sure ya would. It's not too much, it's just more than I've ever handled before. I don't know how to treat it... so I withdraw it all and invest in something less volatile? Do I just leave it sit blindly and hope things continue to go well? Do I split it up amongst many coins? Do I make a down payment on a house and just walk away happy to have made fast money? Idk

Idk man, it's really hard to wrap my mind around. I never thought making a lot of money was bad, but what do you do with it once you have it? How do wealthy people stay that way? 
I'm not a rich person. I'm a regular person who has never made more than 40k in an entire year. And now I make 60k this month? What do I do with it? How do I invest now? I don't want to squander it, lose it? But I also don't want to be afraid and not continue to invest. 
I might have offended people in my post, but I'm honestly a nice guy just looking for others with similar experiences who I can learn from.

Haha. Well, I've ridden the coaster up far enough to have only profits. It's all free money I'm using to make more free money. So I'm not too attached to it. I mean, I definitely want to keep it, what I mean to say is that the reward is worth the risk. Worst that could happen is I don't time it right, and I break even or pay a small premium. 
One time I tried to time the dip and thought Bitcoin would go to $1500. So I didn't buy it at $1800... and then I lost service (because I was camping). The next day BTC was over $3000. Essentially, I'd be $100,000 richer if I hadn't timed the market wrong. My balls still hurt

@_date: 2017-12-02 18:57:45
There is very little luck involved. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Enos, and Ripple are limited supply coins and they are going to continue rising in price for at least the next few years. It's as simple as that. Buy them or don't buy them, I don't care. But I'm buying and hodling. I've made more money in the last 3 months with crypto than I've made at my full-time job making $22 per hour in the last 7 months. It's a no brainer. Buy, HODL. And if you get really comfortable with Hodling then try timing the market and selling at a peak to buy back in lower. I've done that 5 times now when I knew a correction was looming over head, and I've increased my value position 4 of those times (lost $200 bucks one time, but up $3700 because of it). 
Bitcoin and Litecoin can't lose, for at least the foreseeable future.

Think harder next time. Only a completely naive and FOMO stricken noob would have bought in at any price above 15k. I mean, one glance at that chart in November 2017 and any half intelligent person would have said, “naw, shits about to happen.” And after that first huge dip post 19k, anyone with sense should said, “time to get out.”
I bought BTC at 1k, 2k, and even 4k, and sold it all at 17k, because I’m not daft.
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:03:07

@_date: 2018-08-09 03:12:59
If just 4 or 5 millionaires decided to buy the f*ck out of Bitcoin, it would EASILY be worth 20k again! Are you kidding me? How many millions of us are watching every day, waiting for the slightest sign that it’s time to buy in again... dude, if BTC hits 10k ever again I’m dropping $75,000 into it to catch the ride up again. If it ever goes as low as $2500, I’m dropping that same $75,000 into it. You’re brain waves are weak, go to the doctor.

I made off with like $50,000 last year, but still have one year left of college. You don't owe anyone anything, but I would be eternally grateful if you would help me out. Even the cost of books would change my life sir. 
I have done everything myself, working full-time, 18 credit hours each semester, 20 hours a week internships. I get 4-5 hours of sleep each night, and every Tuesday-Wednesday I don't sleep for 32 hours because of my school/intern/work/school/intern schedule... 
It's a long shot, and I understand if you just say piss off. But if you do decide to help me out, I promise to keep working as hard as I can to make a positive impact in the world, and will one day pay your kindness forward.

I’ll just leave this here, in case you don’t fully realize what you just said.
If you invest $1 and it becomes $10 that’s a 1000% return on investment. Now if that $10 loses 80% of its value, you have $2. You’re still up 100% so yay.
But if you invest $10 at the peak, and it loses 80% of its value, then you’re effectively REKT.

@_date: 2017-11-26 10:01:20
32,000 dollars isn't a lot of money? Interesting. It's a hell of a lot more money than $500. And by the way, 71% of humans on this planet make less than $10 per day, which adds up to $300 per month, and $3600 per year. $32,000 is roughly 9 years of labor for someone who makes $10 a day. 
2.5 billion people make $5 per day. That's $150 per month, and $1800 per year. $32,000 is about 18 years of labor for those 2.5 billion people.
Roughly 1.25 billion people make less than $2 per day. That's $60 per month, and $720 per year. $32,000 would be 45 years of labor for them.
With all due respect, you're a spoiled piece of shit, living like a king and having no clue how fortunate you are. $32,000 is a shit ton of money to probably 85% of humanity. Especially if it grew from a meager $500. 
Hold up. If $32,000 isn't a lot of money, then buy $32,000 of Bitcoin today, asshat. 
If $32,000 is not much to you then buy 4 Bitcoin and make a few million, shithead.

But I honestly don't believe in BCH, I think it's all bullcrap hype and manipulation. Still though, there's money to be made.

Dumbass, this is normal. I've been waiting for this pullback, and will use it to increase my value of holdings by selling mid dip and buying back at a lower price. Free money. Check back with me next year buddy ;)

Good job. I'm with ya.

I understand how you feel, as my first weeks investing were filled with anxiety. Now my daily swings are thousands of dollars and it doesn't phase me at all. Once you are convinced in your soul about where this is going, then you'll have no worry. Buy, hodl, repeat.

Miners are incentivized by money. If the 51% guy leaves BTC then the fee price will increase and make the 49% miners more money. 
It will all work out. I don't understand how people don't see the future of Bitcoin as a certainty. Even if it dropped to 3k tonight, I know it'd be 10k by Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:24:16
$500 worth of Bitcoin today would be worth roughly $32,000 if/when Bitcoin is worth $500,000
I'll excuse your low IQ and limited foresight this time around :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:24:06
Never wait OP! I had 10k in my USD account, ready to buy at $1800 per BTC... but I was an idiot, and thought it'd drop a little lower. Long story short, I own 1 Bitcoin and 100 Litecoin. I could have owned 6-7 Bitcoins, but if we wait we'll never own any. 
Buy Bitcoin. HODL. Enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:05:42
I'm not a moron. And I don't think it's fair to call all the people in here morons either.
Is it moronic to gain $5,000 in value this month, and $14,000 this year? I've recouped my initial investment. I have no risk left, only profit. That must be extremely stupid of me.
You said I'm assuming it will keep growing to 500k, but my original comment said "IF/when" Bitcoin is worth $500,000. Can you read? Do you know what the word IF suggests? If means it might, or it might not, just in case you're not aware of that.
Maybe you're just jealous, or upset. Maybe you're just having a bad day. I don't judge you. I hope you buy some Bitcoin and enjoy some growth that you may never see again in your lifetime.

Actually, 2 million Bitcoins have been lost forever. And Satoshi holds 1 million. Assuming Satoshi never sells, there are only 18 million possible bitcoins to circulate.

Cool cool. I used to stack silver, bought several thousand worth at $14 and sold it all at $37. Haven't looked back yet. Although, I think another gold and silver rush is coming in the next few years, and certainly by 2020. This is an excellent time to buy anything of traditional wealth, as everything is moving away from it, and as you likely know, pendulums swing.

Serious question: I bought a Trezor last week, and planned on buying BTC July 28th and cold storing it long term. 
Would I be covered if it splits? When I eventually take it off Trezor, would the other split coin show up?

I believe bitcoin has a determined future, and that very powerful people cause all things great and small to occur with bitcoin for the sake of their own success. That being said, this "fork" is an opportunity for whales to buy thousands of bitcoins at extremely low prices. When bitcoin has been hoarded by the whales and the amount in circulation is reduced, the price will increase beyond its former ATH, and a new floor price will be established. The whales will then use that positive gain for further perpetuation of the bitcoin movement, where another 5-10% of the population will get in on the action. The end game is a predetermined outcome. The trick is to see the forest, rather than the tree. No matter what the potential price is for bitcoin, I've determined a number that I'm getting out at, no matter what. There are very few "ifs" in this arena, but rather "when's." When you see the plan, the steps to get there are obvious.

@_date: 2017-07-23 20:11:52
Ok. Thank you. So owning Bitcoin before August 1st is a no brainer, right? After it splits, it's automatic added value in form of another coin. 
I own 245 LTC currently, but BTC has my mind boggled. Thanks for your thoughts
@_date: 2017-07-14 01:58:12
If BTC continues to rise in price, Gold will eventually rise too. Because the higher BTC goes, the less faith will be in the dollar.

How does setting the network fee work? No more big purchase/sell fees?

It's spreading through the millennial generation like wildfire. I'm betting half of them are just watching right now, maybe playing with a couple hundred bucks worth of coin. But after Aug. 1 when BTC starts climbing like a mountain goat, I bet we'll reach about $4000 and find a new $3500 floor.

In order for him to see that people were interested in sending him money, he'd have to assume people would want to first. So, who was the original poster of these links and photos and whatnot? I bet someone he knows. I mean, it's still great what he did, but he had to have planned on making some BTC off of the stunt.

Thank you for being willing to help! 
Well, at first it wouldn't let me select a state when trying to link a bank account, but it just worked. Now I have everything verified but it won't let me link a bank account. It says complete the other steps first, and I have. I bet I just need to wait a few hours for the verification greens to "sink in," lol. 
I honestly just get kind of lost in the AirBitz app. There's so much going on, like topping up prepaid phones, buying gift cards, etcetera. And the send/request feature seems more difficult than it needs to be (worried I won't copy and paste something right). Also, it's only for Bitcoin correct? No ETH or LTC?
I guess my "problems" are preferences. But I won't complain! I just want to find a Safe place to buy/sell bitcoin in the days just before August 1st, because Coinbase consistently crashes, and I don't think they will have both coins (BC and BU)??? 
Rather than ask for help, I guess I should ask you how you're preparing to get through August 1st. Which wallet will you count of to honor both coin splits? You think the spilt alternative will just suddenly show up in the account alongside the BTC original?
Sorry to write so much and pick your brain to death. Lol
