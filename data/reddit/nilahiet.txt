It sounds more like a common bank problem. 
this article explains that you can't really blame a bitcoin exchange for banks wire problems, it might just be so that your bank is really hard to find or someone at some of the involved banks had a sucky day and it has nothing to do with kraken at all.
There might be four banks involved in sending the wire from their bank account to yours and investigating it will probably take a long time because the banks doesn't really prioritise your specific withdrawal unless it's for a ridiculous huge amount and then if you are unlucky every single bank involved have to investigate it. 
I'm not saying this is the case and that exchanges never are to blame, but most likely one of the banks involved sucks, or all of them.
My advise: deposit money &gt; buy virtual currency &gt; don't sell it and withdraw the funds &gt; use virtual currencies.

buttercoin.con: "Buttercoin's trading engine is the fastest, ever. We built Buttercoin from the ground up for speed and reliability."
I'm the fastest man in the world, ever. 
Honestly, stating that you are the fastest trade engine ever is kinda obnoxious and the way you are responding to me confronting you about it doesn't really help. 
Humility will take you far in this community and I see none from you guys.
I think it's hilarious that you made tests comparing your engine in to mtgox and taking that in to account.

You mean the price of real Bitcoin or GoxCoin?

ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING AN APPLICATION FOR COMMENCEMENT OF A PROCEDURE OF CIVIL REHABILITATION
MtGox Co., Ltd. made today an application for commencement of a procedure of civil rehabilitation (minji saisei) at the Tokyo District Court. This application was accepted on the same day. Further, MtGox Co., Ltd is under several orders issued by the Court : a preservative order prohibiting it from paying its debts, transferring its assets or establishing security over its assets, an order establishing a comprehensive prohibition of forced attachment of its assets by its creditors and a supervisory order ordering supervision by a supervisory committee. In consequence, MtGox hereby informs you as follows.
We first express our most sincere regrets and apologies for this situation and for causing so much inconvenience to all our users and other interested parties. We will fully respect the above orders and maintain our assets with all the necessary care.
Financial situation, reasons and timeline leading to this application
(1) As of now, the liabilities of MtGox Co., Ltd exceed its assets and its financial situation is as follows:
Total amount of assets	 3,841,866,163
Total amount of current liabilities	 6,501,119,371
(2)	The increase of current liabilities may be linked to a loss of bitcoins and customer funds. These are now investigated by an expert and all efforts are made to discover the truth. This application was prompted by the following troubles:
At the start of February 2014, illegal access through the abuse of a bug in the bitcoin system resulted in an increase in incomplete bitcoin transfer transactions and we discovered that there was a possibility that bitcoins had been illicitly moved through the abuse of this bug.
As a result of our internal investigation, we found that a large amount of bitcoins had disappeared. Although the complete extent is not yet known, we found that approximately 750,000 bitcoins deposited by users and approximately 100,000 bitcoins belonging to us had disappeared.
We believe that there is a high probability that these bitcoins were stolen as a result of an abuse of this bug and we have asked an expert to look at the possibility of a criminal complaint and undertake proper procedures.
On the same day (24th), we found out large discrepancies between the amount of cash held in financial institutions and the amount deposited from our users. The amounts are still under investigation and may vary but they approximate JPY 2.8 billion.
We are investigating the causes of these problems. Since there are probably a variety of causes including hacking by third parties, we need to investigate a huge amount of transaction reports in order to establish the truth. As of this date, we cannot confirm the exact amount of missing deposit funds and the total amount of bitcoins which disappeared.
Once we discovered that bitcoins had disappeared and the discrepancies between cash funds and deposit balances, we judged that it would be difficult to continue our activities normally and we therefore closed our site at noon on the 25th (Japan time).
(3)	Regarding the filing of a complaint or damages report, an expert has been mandated and investigations have started. We will make all efforts to ensure that crimes are punished and damages recovered.
Further we will fully cooperate with inquiries from authorities and investigations related to this matter, in Japan or overseas.
In order to increase repayments to our creditors, it is necessary to explore the possibility of having MtGox Co., Ltd. continue its business. This is why the civil rehabilitation procedure has been chosen, Rebuilding MtGox Co., Ltd under the supervision of the court in a legally organized procedure while giving proper explanations will not be for the sole benefit of the company but for that of the whole bitcoin community.
All efforts will now be made to restore the business and recover damages to repay debts to creditors. We hope for the understanding and cooperation of all.

How can you prove that your trade engine is thousands of times faster than existing popular crypto exchanges, how do you know it's thousands of time faster than Bitstamp, Kraken or BTC-E?
