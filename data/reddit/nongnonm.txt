You think we'll see &lt;5k in the next year?
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:38:03
I'd be ok with 4-5k btc.
Finally have my bank acct where I want it to finally buy back in. I was in need of cash during the 3k days.
Of course the times when I do have cash is generally when shit goes south and suddenly I need to spend money again...
@_date: 2019-07-28 04:32:43
And if you love it at 7k boy wait until you see how you feel at 5k!
(Just adding to the joke in case people get butthurt)

But muh free market.
He only thinks about how he'd gain from being a billionaire with no regulation. Never thinks about the consequences of how nightmarish a purely libertarian society would be.
All roads would be toll roads.
@_date: 2019-07-28 07:25:42
...I mean it sounds like you perfectly timed the tops and bottoms. Buying low and selling high is one thing, buying and selling the exact tops and bottoms is luck or some pro level of analysis i've never seen/heard of.
@_date: 2019-07-09 03:36:35
The key is to sell all of it.
It's the only way to please the bull.
@_date: 2019-07-10 09:47:16
In my experience they also never see themselves as becoming the victims of a society run by the rich without any regulations.
I have a very passionately "libertarian" friend who believes the rich and powerful are always going to fight for the good bc its "good for profits."
He also hates toll roads and thinks Amazon needs government intervention. ¯\(º_o)/¯
Also remembered: proudly shouts taxation is theft while on Medicare and going to state funded clinics.
Also kudos to you for seeing the lapses in your judgement.

You got lucky but most people lose more money doing it your way.
@_date: 2019-07-28 04:31:35
Yeah but at 3/4k I didnt have money to spare :(

"Easy come easy go" is how I've come to terms with things.
@_date: 2019-07-23 00:40:15
I dont think any experienced crypto trader relies on news to affect price anymore.
At least I dont.  Seen too many good/bad news come and go and have no affect on price that makes sense at all.
Only thing I can remember on recent months is during the BSV debacle we fell, and when binance got hacked we skyrocketed for some reason.  Most other news just tend to come and go w/o moving the market.  I think we all need to accept that most news based on institutions and such is already priced in like stocks.
@_date: 2019-07-09 03:35:58
Yup. If we can clear 13k we have potential for liftoff.
@_date: 2019-07-23 00:40:50
I've heard this for the last 3 years tho.
@_date: 2018-09-08 05:37:04
HOLY SHIT SELL
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:08:48
This is the opposite of me.
I'm in crypto bc it's better than having money sit in my savings but bc I dont have a need for the profits I just let it sit instead of doing stuff with it.
Would've made it out like gangbusters if I sold at the peak. No regrets just a lesson in learning to take profits.
@_date: 2019-07-23 00:41:24
Generally when it stays this stable it breaks down or up really hard in a few days so sit tight.
@_date: 2018-09-08 05:32:56
HOLY SHIT SELL
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:08:09
I got in earlier than the hype so I'm way past what my bank could offer me.
I'm down from January but I'm not at a loss.

Tfw you want this bear market smashed but you also want to see another dip to buy a bit more...
I'm used to the bear market at this point, I'm ok with a few more months of sideways.

How are you down from two years ago? It was like 4k back then.
Also weren't you the one that called for btc down to like 7k a few weeks back?

...I use wf. I dont pay fees at all and its trivial for me to use my phone to check my balance.  OP is just making problems for himself.
Even if he cant afford to keep enough money in his acct to waive the fees theres still credit unions.

Has to break 7 then 5 first. 
Its unlikely.
If it does, it'll happen so fast nobody will see it coming or it'll bleed out so slow everyone will see it coming.
@_date: 2019-08-23 02:06:23
Look for a small digital device around the house. It might be in a safe or something. 
You're looking for something a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger wallet (google them).
If you find them you'll need a PIN to access them. If you have no idea on the PIN, look for a list of 12 or 24 words. Dont attempt to guess the pin without knowing bc it'll reset the device (not an issue if you have the words)
I know you mentioned a microsd card but the above might also be available.
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:59:52
For fun? OP owns that key.
@_date: 2019-08-29 20:52:04
It is very nonsensical. There's no limit to how long it can stay there. There weren't many posts asking for *even lower* bitcoin during the year long bear market.
@_date: 2019-08-25 03:21:48
That's an expensive challenge.
@_date: 2019-08-23 01:27:42
If you dig around on those online wallets you should be able to find a history of transactions on where he sent them. Should give you an idea on how many he has.
@_date: 2019-08-29 20:48:26
Yeah but this is what people also thought with 6/7k back last summer through November lol. Granted it was a shitshow bc thats when SV came out but still.
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:32:15
It would be a good way to flag people for an audit if they cash out later.
"You cashed out 5k on crypto? When was the purchase date? 2019? You said you didnt buy any. We'll see you in two weeks."
@_date: 2019-08-22 09:30:37
Or people could just as easily panic sell  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
I'd like btc to go up like any other person but I think the growth from 3k to 13k was too fast and was probably done by whales than retail buyers. We might've picked up some organic buyers along the way but could just as easily be floating on whale buys who can dump the price.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:27:31
10x in 2 months seems extreme, even for bitcoin.
what a fucking ride it would be though.

takes bitcoin to make money, takes money to make money, the system won't let us in, not even bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:10:42
you don't actually own the coins.  they're just reflecting the price.  if you're not interested in actually using bitcoin or just planning on trading for the money value then rh is okay if you're fine with risking robinhood shutting down cryptotrading.
if you actually own the coins via a crypto exchange and in a hardware wallet, then you truly 'own' the coins.

if doge hits $1 then the dollar would be in big trouble.
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:12:53
can you nag me
@_date: 2019-02-13 04:53:07
One code plz
@_date: 2019-06-02 02:45:44
Why couldnt it?
They have a place that accepts crypto off-exchange from other people and in cold storage. No need for them to reg with exchanges to actually buy in a way that would affect the price. 
If one bought 10% of all the bitcoins from someone irl, it wouldn't affect the price at all bc exchanges cant keep track of that.
Only reason I dont believe it is bc I dont think billionaires want that much crypto.
If anything doing this would later serve to lower the price bc they're buying privately and selling publically on to exchanges.

This. Anyone who thinks they're delisting bsv because of some moral value over Craig is deluding themselves. 
It's a coin with very little popularity with low potential and a shit "team."
One fewer shitcoin for exchanges to manage and a source for great publicity like they're "listening to the public."  
Exchanges are probably just happy to have an excuse to get rid of it.
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:24:48
agree with most of this.
Few years ago I would've cared.
@_date: 2019-04-15 22:13:05
While 500k is probably unlikely keep in mind that theres a lot of people that dont believe in bitcoin and hundreds of thousands to millions and millions of bitcoins that are forever lost or is no longer claimable.
So while not 500k, still a high number.
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:34:58
Too early to call. Imo it's looking sideways/down more than a leg up but I think we're gonna flag out for a bit until this BSV business settles.
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:56:33
You're gonna hear a lot of replies here talking about taxation being theft and to shuffle around on your taxes bc "screw the govt."
Ask yourself this though: when the tax man comes knocking on your door, are these people going to help you?
File the best you can under good faith. Bc these people advocating for you to lie on your taxes aren't gonna help you at all if you get audited.

Tf? I used deluxe last year and it was fine.
I just got deluxe today too, didnt check on it. Crypto should be reportable like stocks (that's what I did last year) - did you check on if it accepts stocks reports? I remember importing in my info that way last year.

A lot of their net worth could be tied up in property and they're usually too high profile to target. They also invest highly in security and insured like crazy.
Thing with having money is it doesnt come with automatic protection. A lot of the times for people that earn their money are usually protected by those invested in them.  High profile stars or CEOs might have their companies/agencies guide them on how to protect themselves, where to invest money, high end insurance, etc. But lottery winners, bitcoin millionaires, etc are all just normal folk with a lot of money and little knowledge for protection.

Yea I normally discount these random predictions but I would be both be surprised and not surprised if we hit/dont hit 16k sometime between now and end of October. Crypto is a crazy market and a 60% pump isnt unheard of.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:31:43
Lol no. We're still in anxiety.
Look how far up we are from the pump at 1k. If we were following that graph we'd be below 1k.
I'm not calling btc to 1k, just saying that relative to the chart depression would be below 1k.

Then you should.  Both ledger and trezor have been successfully hacked before.
