I figured a bunch of people ask it. I'm not really in it for profit. It's too late for that so it seems. The business is so lucrative now. However, I love the science and the experience. I might see this through.

Right. Bitcoins are absolutely volatile and scary but hey that's life.

Lol I have no idea. I thought it was funny though. I've been down voted twice on this thread I think. People have their reasons for hatin' I guess.

That's what I figured. If I could just break even on the hardware I'd be willing to sacrifice the power. Our rates here are pretty good we have TVA. I was looking at a 14th/s antminer system.

I love the idea of supporting the network and that is the main reason I'd be willing to invest in an asic device I'm just scared of not breaking even which is really all I care about. If I can have the device pay for itself then I'm ok with the whole idea. I am a network tech by trade so the sound of servers humming is music to my ears. The volatility of bitcoins are what scare me. I can't afford to lose $3000 on an asic device that only sucks down energy and costs me money. I really appreciate the advice you've given me. What it really boils down to is should I shell out the cash and make a gamble.

Well I meant new comer to this thread. I should've been more specific. I've never mined before but I do have experience with crypto currency. Yes ideally I would be doing this for experimentation and decentralization.

Oh they will. If it looks like money and smells like money it's probably a computer.

This is what I was wondering. I've been looking into an antminer s9. With the 14 TH/s rate the calculator I used calculated I COULD pull a profit but people keep discouraging me with the "no just buy them" answers. I'm not looking to be a millionaire I know it's too late for that as mining is so lucrative now. But, if I could just make a grand a year I'd be happy.

I'm trying to decide on that myself. The asic device I was looking at was a 14th/s with +-10% variance. I can eat the electrical costs if I can recoup my hardware investment.

I don't think they'd like me sucking down their already massive electricity bill :)

I've been told this so many times now it's starting to make me wish I would've bought some this week.
