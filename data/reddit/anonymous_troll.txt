Just to throw it out there, Kuchter has struck me as intelligent and realistic when he speaks.  He knows he's a star who is famous for doing goofy things, but he gives heartfelt advice that is level-headed on occasion.

TIL conspiracy theorists on reddit still link to globalresearch.ca.

It may not be brilliant, but it's better than the other stuff that celebrities are spouting off at kids.

I feel for people who want gender reassignment, but you should probably reserve this kind of drama for when it's a medical necessity.  If I had to pick between donating to someone dying of cancer and someone who wants different gear between their legs, I'd choose the cancer victim.

The fair price of bitcoin is $700, maybe $600 due to people losing confidence in the currency.  If the panic sell drops to $500, I'm trading my DOGE to buy back in to BTC, though I'll probably see if I can feel out where the bottom is first.  I'm hoping that its $450 and that I'll take out a nice little payday, but, honestly, the price seems rock solid even with all of to recent bad press.

I've heard MOM is a little dodgy.  Canada is pretty different from the US on the marijuana front, and it's almost entirely based on enforcement.  You can go to well-known and publicised establishments to smoke, and can easily make purchases nearby.  The police simply don't enforce in these safe spaces.

This is literally stolen from the dogecoin sub, with the doge head removed.

They spend more than that on you per week, and you're not going to outstrip what they spend on you in speculation on bitcoin on a $100 investment.  This past month of growth was amazing.  You would have made $500.  They spent more on you than that.

Your parents give you an allowance to spend on things that you need.  It's not money that you earned, and they can say what you can and can't do with it.  I work for a living.  I make money.  I do what I want with that money.  Holding your parents hostage because you want to gamble on internet money isn't cool.  If they don't want to give you money for that, then you don't get to use their money that way.  Again, the amount of money that they are spending on you far outstrips whatever earnings you could make off of your allowance unless your allowance is completely excessive.  I spend thousands of dollars a month keeping MYSELF alive.  If your parents are giving you that kind of money in your allowance, and you bitch that you can't use it in certain ways, then you're completely spoiled (and probably come from the kind of wealth that means that earning some on bitcoin doesn't mean that much).

My parents would tell me to be glad that there's fucking food on the table and that they gave me money at all.  It's not their responsibility to pay out on your speculation.  Take your fucking allowance and be grateful.  Your parents pay for much more than you're likely to make by investing the money that they *also* gave you.  This isn't a lack of logic.  If you want money that's actually your own money, then go out and earn it like an adult, and not in some bullshit, "the neighbor gave me $40/hour because we go to the same church," way.  Go do hard work like your parents do.  Don't, however, tell them how they're going to pay you for the privilege of you being their crotch fruit.  If you have food on the table and an education, they're already doing their jobs.

Not to mention that $1200 was a predictable bubble and it's already rebounding.  The skilled traders are laughing themselves to sleep with visions of Ferraris and gold pills filling their heads.

That's the kind of big government investment that shoots the value up about $40 on announcement.

This.  I was just finishing up grad school and had no moneys.  I own *very* little BTC.  I've been able to watch it grow, but the amount that I hold would barely cover an expensive date.
