@_date: 2018-01-08 08:09:36
Any deeper insight? :D (I know very little on exchanges)
I assume exchanges just want to earn fiat. Some people saw a oppertunity in the crypto market.
Now I am writing this I do quickly see how a exchange would benefit from a healthy cryptospace: more money to be made.

People getting back into btc for the fork is my guess. People tent to switch back and forth between btc and alts since that is the trading pair.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:21:30
1. Install a wallet supporting the forked coin  
2. Move all your Electrum funds to a new Electrum wallet to protect them. This will move only your BTC, and not your forked coins. Wait until the transaction is confirmed. 
3. Enter the seed of your (!now empty!) old wallet or private keys in the wallet supporting the forked coins. "Sweep the old wallet" 
The gold and bcash are both on your current seed/private key

The upcoming forks aren't deemed to be as interresting by the community then the bcash and 2x forks. I know minimal about it too. Unlike bcash and 2x however they arent going to try and take over the bitcoin name though. They are just trying to ride it success this far.

See my reply to original comment
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:05:32
Then you will have to move them to a wallet of which you own the private key before the snapshot of the fork.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:57:49
People seem to report insane fees, just did a transaction...wasn't as astronomical as is being claimed.

@_date: 2017-12-27 11:03:49
I am confused,do or do you not own the private key of where your btc ia currently stored?
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:06:08
1) As far as i know they dont support it, so you dont get them
2) In your current situation yes, if the fork happens whole the transaction is pending, the coins are deemed to be on the sending side of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:05:05
It could be, but it should also work cross wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:49:59

Electrum seems to be fine. 2fa, fee density slider, segwit. I'd recommend a hardware wallet though if you own more then you are comfortable to carry around on your real life wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:47:37
You need to own that fraction of  a BTC in a wallet of which you own the private key during the snapshot of the blockchain at which the fork happens. 
Then ro claim your forked coins, move your btc to a diffeent wallet and sweep (scan private key) the wallet with a wallet that supports the forked coin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:55:09
1) ask yourself the question: does the cost justify the security to the amount of btc i own, or do i expect it to do that in the future
(I take the risk of keeping 100 bucks in my irl wallet, but 1000 bucks i keep in the bank.

I used to use exodus before i got a nano ledger s, in developer mode you can extract your private key from it. It doesnt have 2fa however, so i consider it unsafe. On this sub people seem to be moving to electrum.

I feel like with this new energy concern about BTC they are pulling the  shit in us like reddit did to EA for SWBF2.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:15:43
BCP and B2X are next. Move your coins from coinbase to GDAX for free. (Same company) then transfer them from GDAX to wallet of which you own the private key (i used to use exodus untill i got a hard wallet, but it doesnt have 2fa, do your research and choose). 
You then own the private key of the adress the btc is stored on during the forks on the 2nd and 28th of Januari and are thus credited your forkes coin. 
To claim: move btc to a diffrent wallet, sweep the private key with a wallet that supports the forkes coin and done.

Since you have jaxx you have a 12 word masterseed. In electrum choose the option restore wallet in the startup and enter that masterseed, done.

I did the same at your age, but with 2k safety net, it has done well since then.
See it as not having that money anymore and start looking at it again when you leave school, seriously, forget about it in the meanwhile. 
The money is probably nothing compared to the savings you will make when you start working.
If this thing explodes that's awesome, if it doesn't, meh I consider it lost.
