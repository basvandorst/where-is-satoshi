How useful would money be if it was accepted in less than 1% of instances of possible transactions? The answer is not very. Good money needs to have a general acceptance of its value within an economy, but your point is true and the qualifier "terrible" would have been more appropriate.


Bitcoin is a terrible Store of value because it is highly volatile and that was the point I was referring to. Now, I am not saying I do not speculate that the value of Bitcoin will rise astronomically, but that is speculation that the asset will grow into the future of money.
If one truly thought Bitcoin was currently good money then would not take a second thought to all of their net worth in it; a true hodler of last resort.

Money's value should not fluctuate. Bitcoin is also not a [Standard  of Deferred Payment](

Critically read my other comments in the thread. I think you will find we don't completely disagree.


I never stated that; you are pulling that assumption out of thin air.

﴾͡๏̯͡๏﴿ O'RLY? I would think that it can't be a straw man argument if it was never an argument in the first place. I was only pointing out technicalities; you even noticed that. I think you are seeing red.

I was never knighted, but I will take it as a compliment that you thought I was. Thanks!

Then you are simply not a true hodler of last resort.

That is gambling and unhealthy unless you have the appropriate cash flows. If you just gambling your future then you mine-as-well leverage trade too.

Correct me if I am wrong, for this software, isn't all he would have to do is disconnect his pc from the internet and change the time on his system? If true this guy is verifiably less computer capable than a 12 year-old who hacked his Xbox achievements. Is he really even a doctor or did he fake that too?
I think I am wrong, but, nevertheless, he is still dumb though.

First of all, it is called hard money not ""real" money".
Secondly, Bitcoin is not currently money because to be money it needs to be stable and widely accepted. Bitcoin is currently a speculative asset.

Very big of you.

What I said had nothing to do with the nature of reality.
There is no such term as "real money"; the technical term for what you were describing is hard money. Here is the breakdown:  [

Bitcoin is a poor store of value because it is highly volatile, which means not stable; this term "not stable" is the opposite of stable if you are unfamiliar with the convention. This makes it not money.

Philosophy is not psychology.

I hope the first thing you did, when in the past, was try to buy more Bitcoin. The qualifier "terrible" would have been an appropriate addition.

I am aware; one assumption at a time, it is not like "meds world" exists either.

Seems like it, but it is fun to reply to these comments.
People on this subreddit love to be pretend economists and then they post definitions that prove themselves wrong; this is digital gold!
