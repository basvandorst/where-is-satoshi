This story is too close to being a PR disaster for Bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:58:26
Good! The foundation needs to stop being secretive about what their goals are! The people want decentralization, not blacklists and regulation! Keep the bitcoin tech free!

Hey, Bitcoin is a democracy, so If you want to blacklist addresses on your node and mining pool knock yourself out.
What is scary is Mike also wants Bitcoin to go in a direction where you *won't* be able to run your own node. You *won't* be able to be part of the democracy.
It's one thing to say you can vote however you want. Thats fine! It's another thing to say 'Oh, BTW, lets also implement poll taxes to keep the riff-raff out!'

NO! With Bitcoin, if two different nodes differ, even slightly, all hell breaks loose. You want exactly one branch of mining software. It's totally unlike normal software.
This is what makes Gavin and especially Mike Hearns crazy obsession with forcing Bitcoin to scale by just jacking up the blocksize so dangerous. We've all seen software fail at high loads, when it worked fine at low loads, yet in Bitcoin even a tiny *difference* in behavior is devastating, let alone a failure. Letting the blocksize just grow like they want means every time transaction volume goes up, there are a whole new class of potential chain forking vulnerabilities.
Why can't they just leave it alone? I don't need to make every stupid penny bet and other crap go right on the blockchain itself, just keep my savings secure.

Do those bankers know about Bitcoin? This may be a simple case of "money is there, lets grab it" without considering the long term affects. I think actions like this just push people to storing money in alt-assets, but maybe the assumption is those alt-assets can be confiscated next time around too? Hard to know with the opaque banking system.

I'm not a crypto-ninja, but I read his leaked info and figured it out and could crash it locally with bloom requests. People are trying to fix this Peter says and have responsibly done it in secret. WTF Gavin?! Why risk Bitcoin with disclosure before a fix?
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:37:04
And this is the guy who wants to make Bitcoin scale to huge transaction volumes by just removing the blocksize limit! The fact is if that happens there will only be a tiny number of people running bitcoin nodes. It will be too expensive to keep up unless you are a big business!
Do blacklists happen when anyone can participate fully in Bitcoin by running their own node? Heck no. But if just big business and government can participate? Heck yes!
I totally agree, Mike is either a myopic man, or someone with very evil intentions. He works at Google, who pays him to work on Bitcoin on company time, so I suspect the latter myself.

So right now the game plan of the developers is to just make the blocksize bigger when Bitcoin usage explodes. So to run a Bitcoin node or mining pool or anything you will need tens of thousands or even million of dollars worth of equipment handling the huge numbers of transactions. This won't be something you can run on your own, it'll be big banks doing this and they'll be able to pick and choose who can do a Bitcoin transaction.

Yes!! When you push Bitcoin hard, telling people to buy Bitcoins, it makes it a scam in their minds. But when you ask people for Bitcoins, it shows that you feel they are worth real value.

REALLY worries me to see one of the core developers trying to get support for making blacklists a part of Bitcoin! If Mike wants a currency with blacklists he should go back to working on Google Wallet! I support censorship free currency, not one with authorities trying to freeze my funds!
@_date: 2013-03-10 06:59:38
If you look at the core developers, like the lead Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, they all have this vision of Bitcoin in the future where only a very small number of validating nodes have any hope of holding the blockchain and acting as mining pools. Mike Hearn works for Google, and he's the one pushing most for this stuff... just ask yourself why.
@_date: 2013-03-14 05:30:42
I understand that there are "chaum tokens" where the bank can not know who you are paying money to with crypto math stuff. A chaum token bank would be truly anonymous.
The issue is that if the core is centralized, governments can take over that core, and censor the transactions of anyone who operates a layer above. Like a genuinely anon chaum token bank.
I think the pseudo-anonymity of blockchains is something government wants. All that data to do analysis on. All those people who think they can be anonymous but do not realize how the links can be connected.

Attackers follow github.
But people need to know if Gavin is irresponsible. His salary is our donations &amp; bitcoin foundation dues.
If I had found that bug would I have informed him now? No! I would have told other core dev members, not him, because he has shown himself to leak info.

In private on the  list with cleared trustworthy people. Core coders and big vendors.
Not public where everyone sees even with bad motivations.

VISA volumes do not have to be done with the transactions all on the blockchain. I am happy to use EasyWallet and Mt. Gox and other centralized providers to the funds i use day to day because the risk is low. An ecosystem of transactions done with those providers can support any scaling the community wants without forcing the risk of the core of Bitcoin breaking and becoming itself centralized.

Why would those governments allow for mixing on the blockchain? Yes it is technically possible now, but that is my whole point. If miners are government regulated the government will ban mixing on the blockchain, and they can.
If the core of Bitcoin remains decentralized and free there is nothing government can do to stop chaum token banks from operating. Nor can they stop mixing on the blockchain from happening.

We need more people like you working on REAL ways to make Bitcoin scale AND keep bitcoin free!
Thank you!!
