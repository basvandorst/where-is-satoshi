So basically, each decision would come with a set of coins. The coins would be tied up so that they are deliveder only at the end of the work and upon presentation of the results, and would be given after an m on n vote (I actually have a better model for this, but never mind... Later). This can work for convincing people to write some code that is then used by people in the DAO.
I am not sure it would be able to prevent actions against the DAO from people who are not interested in being paid. If someone does something illegal, you might need to have the police intervene, and might need to pay a lawyer, as described above.
Still we need to have a decision system... Something tied with bitcoins. 
Starting with the discussion system. Maybe each person need to send some satoshi to speak. And people vote up a coment with tips, which are then sent back to the writer of the comment. Something like this would also make spamming a costly activity.
Decisions would have to be divided into their basic types. Each basic type would use a different strategy... I need to think about this one and maybe open a thread just for this. Thanks.

Thank you very much. No, right now I was not interested in building a server, as I have already a project i am working on. So my curiosity was purely academic.
I like your idea of two people betting on the game of others. Also that can be done half way through the game, i suspect. With people accepting very different bets as the odds changes. In fact I can see how such system could be added to many other games. I'm thinking at chess, checkers, and quoridor. But you need to make it impossible, encryption level impossible for the two players to know who the other player is and so agree on the less probable result and then split what they made.

This is something I am painfully aware. We like bitcoin, and we use them, and expect them to take over the world (or so we hope). But the side effect of this would be to take away the power of governments to print money. Many people like this. Printing money has always been used (also) to fund wars. You take this away, and wars will be harder and smaller. More like the middle ages wars, were a war was not a global nation effort. Although of course technology is also responsible for the global nature of war. So if bitcoin takes away some power from the us or russia or china... Well that's ok.
But printing money is generally a tax, and it is a tax that hits especially the people who hoard the money, and do not put it to any use. If your money is invested, and there is inflation, you will likely get your money back. But keep it under the mattrass and it will lower its value. And where has this value gone? In a sense it has gone to the government that printed the money.
It is easy to say that the money printed has not been put at good use, but if you just look at the difference between countries with double digit inflation and failed states. You will notice that failed states do not have a working government. There are warlords. Rape and violence are rampant, double digit inflation are terrible places to be, but are better than failed states, as somehow are still working.
So, as I am worried for Italy that with the Euro has lost the power to print money to get out of debt, so I think that bitcoin are great.... But also a great danger. They will force governments to be good administrators of their digital gold. And politicians (elected or otherwise) statistically are NOT good administrators.
So I am worried, and I understand Bangladesh.

Seizing bitcoins, means moving them from an address you control to an address they control. Instead what they did, as I understood, was taking the phyisical object that had the private key on. He could have had the private key somwhere else, and just moved them as soon as he was back in cntrol

Unless the ideology is so oppressive that innovators chose to live elswhere (assuming they can leave). Which is what drove Fermi and Einstein in the US. And what made sure US developed the bomb before Germany.
Take away message is: innovation can happen under nearly all ideologies. The relation between the ideology and the innovation is a complex one. For example right now are really working on gene therapies. Could it be (just making a wild guess, as i am an European) that Christian ideology is slowing that innovation trend over there.

Yes, it is cyber bullying. And like all bully cases, the "we were just joking, and he deserved it anyway, and he is a crybaby, spoiled rich kid for protesting" claim is just floating in the air. I actually do not know who this guy is. I am not american, do not see television from a long time, and never saw south park except a couple of episodes. So I can have a pretty neutral pov.
This is raising serious ethical issues in fact. Not this instance in particular, which is quite bland and benign, but the fact in general. if you agree that info wants to be free, and central banks should not control the currency, then you (like me) might never have thought about it.
But can this technology be used to do "uncool" things? And I am afraid the answer is yes. And I do not think it can be stopped in general (they might have stopped it in this case, but this is a one of). We WILL live with the consequences. Both the good (which looks really good and promising) and the bad (which we are just now starting to consider).

What abot teaching our brothers social skills?
If their dad didn't do it. Maybe because they were divorced and wouldn't grow up with them.
If their mother cannot do it, because no mother can teach to their son when, and how to approach a woman they are interested in. (They can say what not to do, but not what to do,mwhich is what those guys need to learn)
Then it falls on our shoulders (of men) to do this.
It was obvious that this guy was interested in this girl. And he had absolutely no social skill. Kickink him raises hte probability of him becoming an outcast. Gives him even less option to learn and then refine his social skill. And will make him even more a problem for society in future. Maybe not for this community, but for the next one.
For me, when I was at a meeting, and a guy approached me in a way that i did not appreciate (he simply put his hand over mine), I slightly slapped his hand with mine other hand. It was simply a tap, but done in public, and full visibility to all. He surely must have felt very self conscious and he never approached me again.

I am a great supporter of non anonymous voting. Mostly because I see it as inevitable once you move to more complex forms of voting where people don't indicate only a single candidate, but a set (approval voting), an ordered list (condorcet pr borda) or an evaluation for each candidate (range or majority judgment -check that out, it's better than range-). In such complex systems if you can check if in the ballot there is a particular configuration you can prove that a person has voted. Plurality is a shitty form of voting but it is anonymous. I would be willing to give up anonymity to have a good form of voting. But we know that when we ask people to vote and we record the results. And then we ask them to vote again, but this time it is anonymous, we find a big difference in the results. Thus a lot of people are in some ways coerced to vote in a certain way. I don't think we can have both, but we must be aware of what we are losing when we chose.

I think what you say is very plausible and even nearly inevitable. I wonder how much will this spread through the world. Let's remember that this is a world currency. First of all not all nations will agree to this. Does this mean you cannot sell to people in countries that do not recognise it? What about all the people in thrid world countries which probably will not adopt all this. This will provide a serious white to black route. An immigrant lives in the US, registers an address, from that address sends bitcoin to his wife/parents/kids in developing countries. Those people will either have an unregistered address, or will have a registered address but all the people downhill from them will be unregistered.

Well, it is not mapping the whole blockchain. Only the address used. Even if it was 100 address for each person registered in mygox, it would still be a number of address easily computable by today standards. In any case co sder that their "mysql"(!) db was able to hold a list of all the address, and private keys. Amazon holds a table of all people,vs all books,
Honestly we are used to handle much more big data.
This does not mean that we have the capacity to calculate a private key. But to compute the graph, hell yeah!

No, I think you are spot on. Germany only sccepted the Euro if it was inndependent from political manuvers, and the head of the ECB would just print to keep a fixed low but higher than 0 inflation rate. This worked well in Germany after WW2. But now the times has changed. We do not have so much energy anymore. The real economy is not growing as it used to. So debt of the country keep growing while GDP cannot.

I cannot believe that Ulbricht does not have a separate backup for the passwords to his bitcoins. I mean NO ONE holds holds all his passwords into a single HD, which can burst in flames, be stolen, ...
So we shall assume he has. (Plot twist)
Now what stops him from moving all the coins to another wallet before the Police do it? 
Now it is the police that must prove that it was him moving those coins and not someone else that had (found) the password. He can claim it was stolen by one of the technicians in the forensic department of the police.

If he says to the police no one has access, no one has access. If someone else has access, or he has keys around, he was laying. And thus would go to jail.

I think building solar road is a wonderful aim, that we surely can achieve. After all already a parking lot has been built, so we just start small and in very sunny places like texas or italy. 
I mention italy, not just because i am italian, because bitcoin should send a very clear message of being international. We should make many small projects all around the globe. Starting with the nations where the laws are more favorable, the climate is hotter. In fact we should start with the nations that are in favour of bitcoin, like singapore. Like saying, you open up to us, and we give back to you so much more.
Also it makes sense. Mining bitcoin is a very energy intensive process. It would be good it bitcoiners would produce more energy than we are using up.

Although I hold, There is something that is going around my mind. Yes, we hold, and more and more people accept bitcoin. But although bitcoin number never expands you will have other currencies. Now it is true that bitcoin can get smaller and smaller. But it is also true that every time you buy some bitcoin you raise the galue for all others. At some point if two currencies are both used, and i need tp buy one, I might chose to buy the "other" one just because I do not want the rich to get richer.

I have been following Chris Martenson for some years now, and have seen his full Crash Course (about 3 hours) at least 3 times. It was worth.

Buy only things you would buy in any case. And transform new €$ in bitcoins for this. But anything you CAN buy with bitcoin, and you were going to buy anyway, buy it using them. It takes a long time for other people to open a transaction channel to change dollars or euro in btc. But once you have it open it usually takes less. I know it took me ages to get all the permissions to use kraken, but now i can send money in 24h and some is just parked there waiting to be transformed.

All in all if I were to live in the US I would not feel that secure about it all. I think this law will change because the US will succumb on the fact that other countries has better tax laws, and technological innovation will move there.

I am still positive. If I were to sell now I still would get more than I put in in the first place. But yes, I am ignorant of day to day trading, which is why I am of the opinion that this investment will be worth some life changing values in 5 years time. So I put in a non life changing value now, and I am not going out before time, i did get out once, when the price plummet, and it bounced immediately up again, so at the end I risked losing money on that. Eventually the price went back down to the point where I sold, so I could buy back at no loss. But that was my lesson. If you do day trading you do day trading, if you do long term trading, do that. I should probably have sold a small portion when it was at 1000 just to get back the money I invested in the first place. And I actually did, that was the money I lost inside mtgox.

Instead of playing in defence we should attack. We should make a page in the bitcoin wiki with a list of banks that are bitcoin friendly and a list if banks that are bitcoin enemies. And simply use the bitcoin friend ones. If we organise and advertise it, eventually the banks will compete not to lose the clients. Of course unless they are really worried that bitcoin might take their whole business away. But I think most bank are really not that worried, they just don't want to risk being connected to something that might be declared illegal tomorrow.

Absolutely perceived even from now. Every day the market has to absorb 25 x 6 x 24 bitcoins. If the bitcoin community hasn't grown by that much the price goes slightly down. Honestly I wish the production of bitcoin was somehow tied tp the amount of transactions in a period, while still having a limit (this can be done by multiplying the number of bitcoin produced by a constant that slowly goes to 0)

This sense makes no. If i hoard bitcoin, I will only let them go if the price in bitcoin is much lower than the price in onther currencies.
Also I do not undertsand why people should use bitcoin from their stash. You keep the stash in cold storage, and change bitcoin when you need to buy something, keeping some cash in fiat cureency parket at the exchange. Only when all the money they have is in bitcoin then it makes sense to use their stash, or when they get only paid in bitcoin. Not really the case for now

Great analysis. I'll be brief. Personally I hope for non-linear reaction. Although now the price is stable, more and more people are using it.
Once the price is sta le enough and merchant use it enough and there is an external big crises, like banks failing, government giving a haircut, one or two currency failing and going in hyperinflation...  
That's where I will expect mass adoption to start.
On the other side, bitcoin has paid some big prices to get where it is: a lot of people in the early days bought a lot and hodled. Those people are now millionair on paper. If a person has right now 10 millions in bitcoin, that is enough to live a good life for him and his family for all your life anywhere in the world. So they might not look for more money, and might just be aiming to slowly get out. If you have enough of those people, you have a cap over how much bitcoin can raise, until that person has been paid off of his 10 million bitcoin will not raise.
Imagine if Satoshi himself wanted to slowly change even half of his bitcoin in fiat because he would realise that his life is too short compared to the adoption time of bitcoin? This would cap bitcoin price for a longlong time.
Sorry to see you go.

You can throw away all those parenthesis because you are always using the same operation inside so
B ^ [[-A ^ B ] ^ A]=
B ^ -A ^ B ^ A
Then you apply commutativity, move things around, and the fact that 
 B ^ B = B
and you have B ^ [A ^ -A] = B ^ false= false
now about your article...
what would be the consequences of it?
A) I always understood that the fact that money was created slowly prevented it from decreasing in value too fast. But if that is not where the limit is, why doesn't inflation spiral out of control? And why did it do in Germany between the two wars?
B) Second question, bringing all this back to bitcoin. We use bitcoin which is a limited resource with the understanding that it would go up. But this would be true if bitcoin was the only currency. Having many currencies in theory would still make bitcoin go up as they other are inflationary, but bitcoin is deflactionary. But the problem is that there is nothing to force people to keep using bitcoins if they don't want to. So bitcoin can rise, people can decide it has risen enough. Another crypto can be there (we don't create money, we directly create whole currencies!) and the money can expand without the bitcoin needing to raise in price. Right?
So if A is true and inflation is not generated by money priniting but by [?]
And if B is true and bitcoin does not need to raise.
Will it raise to the moon, or go to the ground, or remain hanging in midair?
LATE EDIT: Note that "needing to raise" is not the same as raising.

It would be interesting if the person guest would pay in bitcoin, and the landlord could chose to be paid in bitcoin as well. But we have the old problem of volatility. I register for a plat, and pay my money (0.5 btc) for a vacation that will happen 1 month from now, one month passes, and i am ready to go and stay in the house. In theory i enter the flat and after the first day the landlord would get my payment. But how much should that be? In theory 0.497 btc circa. But the volatility problem is around the corner.
The problem is that airbnb holds the money between the time in which a reservation is made and the time the person sleeps the first night.
Will airbnb hold the money as dollars or as btc?
If it holds as dollar:
Case 1, the value pf btc has not changed. All is fine. 
Case 2 the value is much higher. But the person cannot get back his 0.5 btc. Is this legal? The landlors also will either be paid in dollars or in btc. If in dollar is not a problem but it does not help the btc economy, if in btc, he will expect to receive 0.498 btc, and instead it would take much less.  
Case 3 the value of btc drops. Of course the guest does not eliminate the transaction. But how will the landlord be paid?   
If it holds bitcoin it is even more risky.
Case 2: the value is much higher. Now there is a very big risk that the person will change his reservation, get back his 0,5 btc and reserve again. 
Case 3 the value drops. Now the landlord is unhappy and can pull back at the last minute.
So there are risks. Because the more people pull back at the last moment, the less people will want to use the site. So probably the only way btc could be used is if it gets transformed into dollars immediately. Held as dollars. And the landlord paid in dollars. Or paid in btc as the valuation of the day of the rent. But is it legal?

Hello Olivier,
my name is Pietro Speroni and I am a researcher and consultant in eDemocracy. I have helped develop at least 4 projects run by the Italian government, consulted for several others, and I am in touch with the wide community of people developing eDemocracy systems.
I would say you need to approach this problem in stages. First of all there is the need to decide on what should be designed. And that in itself is a goal. Bettermeans is a good starting point, but speaking as an expert in the topic it can be improved in many many ways (for one use the median and not the average when assigning how much have each person contributed. The mediane is the Condorcet winner in a 1D poll. The average can be manipulated with strategic voting).
Once the design is decided, and this will take at least 1 month straight. And it should NOT be a simple proposal vote system. But a recurrent system: 
proposals, votes, filtering out some proposals.  
New proposals, votes, filtering out some proposals. 
New proposals, votes, filtering out some proposals.  
New proposals, votes, filtering out some proposals. 
Until the system reaches either one winner, or a set of winner and we can see that it does not go further than that. Then you would chose among those proposals which one satisfies you the best. This is basically using a (human based) genetic algorithm to find the best fit solution. 
This can be done in several ways. Depending on how many people participate in the process. This community is very interesting, but it is also quite big. The more people participate, the more the system must be rough in evaluating each participant point of view. Let me clarify, people participate in different ways. Some people propose, some comment, and some evaluate. The problem with the proposing is that is can be redundant (many people proposing the same thing). And then there is a big risk that proposals that arrive later on are not evaluated as well as the first ones. For example this is a weakness in reddit. My comment arriving now will probably not be read by as many people as the first comments. And might remain quite unknown. Still I hope *you* will will read it. In a distributed decision making system this is a very serious flaw. And something against which I have worked for some serious amount of time. For example see [my talk on Fair Participation]( in 2011. But this is only one of the problem, and we can solve this simply by making the system recurrent (like a genetic algorithm), and maybe putting a little cost in presenting a proposal.
But then there is something else. And that is, how do you evaluate the point of view of different people? That is, how do you evaluate the people voting? 
In democracies we make people vote. And there is a 300 years discipline (called voting theory) that studies what are the best ways to do it. Started around the time of the French Revolution with Borda and Condorcet. I would say that whoever programs this application, must know voting theory inside out. And basically the central idea is that who gets more votes wins. You can vote in different ways, depending on the various methods. In Condorcet system, you compare each proposal against each other and find if there is one that wins against all the other in a pairwise comparison, but basically the idea is one: who gets more supports wins.
I would like to suggest a different option to decide how should the next decision system for the bitcoin community be programmed. Something on which I have worked for the last 5 years, and thought about for much longer. It's based on the idea that a proposal A dominates another proposal B iff (if and only if) for every person that supports B, that person supports also A. Plus there is at least a person that supports A but does not support B. So we are not saying that A is better than B if more people vote for A than for B. That has to be true, but it is not enough. We are saying that there must be no one who likes B and does not like A. This is a much stronger requirement. And will force a democratic decisione to a halt if too many people participate (or if people that have a stake in the proposal participate). But it is much much much more powerful and fear. You are basically considering each persone point of view as a separate dimension. 
And then once we have found which proposal dominate which other, we filter out the dominated proposals and remain with the undominated one. Technically called the Pareto Front (from the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto). Notice that each person that voted, will find at least one of the proposal he has voted for in the Pareto Front. So you can say that the Pareto Front is really the expression of this group of people.
With a colleague, I have developed a system to do this, it is called Vilfredo (short for Vilfredo goes to Athens). People can ask a question, propose, vote. The system filters the dominated proposals, and presents to the community the undominated ones. Which are then taken as a base to inspire the writing of the new proposals. 
As we said this more powerful form of voting only works for small groups of people. Up to 20 people. After which too many proposals are not dominated, and the filter stops working. But more people can propose. The limit here is that the number of proposals must be such that every voting person must be able to read all the proposals.
Let's be clear I am NOT suggesting this system to substitute the bitcoin foundation. I wish we could make this work, but the 20 people limit is a strong mathematical limit. 
But I am suggesting this system to decide the system that should substitute the bitcoin foundation.
Everybody can present their design. You chose 20 people who will vote, you being one of them. Those people will also agree not to suggest any proposal. It is important that those people are as diverse as possible. As each will have veto power over every proposal, and the Pareto Front will be their expression. BTW, it is also possible to set up a common account where a person represents several people. And they commonly vote to decide what to support. Like an account for the Reddit community.
* People present their proposal. The commission votes. The Pareto Front is extracted.
* People present their proposals integrating the proposals in the Pareto Front and making them better. The commission votes. The Pareto Front is extracted.  
* People present their proposals integrating the proposals in the Pareto Front and making them better. The commission votes. The Pareto Front is extracted.  
* People present their proposals integrating the proposals in the Pareto Front and making them better. The commission votes. The Pareto Front is extracted.
...until the system stabilises. At which point you chose the winner (unless there is a consensus in which case it is chosen by the commission).
Note that this system has several extra feature that are quite unique.
1) because we know how everybody votes, the system can mathematically find out who are the outliers. In particular who are the people who have not voted for a proposal A, but if only they voted for that proposal, the Pareto Front would have been different (because A would have dominated a proposal B). Then:
1.1) Usually we ask those people to rewrite this proposal, and often the result is something A' that wins both A and B, thus simplifying the system in the next generation
1.2) we also find out who should speak with whom. Maybe trying to convince them. Or asking them why they vote against a particular proposal. All this makes it easier for the system to each a smaller Pareto Front (remember we are aiming for a Pareto Front of 1).
As I tried to explain this system does not work for every type of question. It works for some kind of questions, for groups of a certain size (5-20). But for this kind of situation it works very very well. Which is why I am suggesting it.
Once we have decided the design, then an open source project can be opened to run it, and another bounty could be done for the various stages of it.
Late edit: 
1) grammar.
2) clarification on how people proposals can be redundant

I don't understand. I don't use coinbase, i'm in europe and I will not use it. But still I would like to understand. How can coinbase prevent people from sending coins to someone. Can the coinbase user just send all the coins to an account they control and then from there do what they want with them?  
If they cannot send coins to their own private account they don't own the coins.  
If they can, coinbase has no power.
