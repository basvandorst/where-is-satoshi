Dang it I attempted to sign up for BitStamp to buy some XRP, but it said that since I am in WA state, I cannot compete the sign up process. Anyone have any advice?

It’s a good video, but honestly I would have trouble getting anyone who does not understand bitcoin to watch it because it’s 22 minutes long.
Usually people want to 30’second elevator pitch. I think I could get them a 3 minute video that explains it, but that’s about it.
Kurzgesagt does a good job of explaining complex things like this in under 7 minutes.

So your art is saying Bitcoin is worthless? But only has value to suckers who will pay exorbitant amounts for it? Then Shouldn’t it be a $100 bill taped to a wall?
Is this bitcoin art for the sake of bitcoin art around a currently popular topic?
This is getting outta hand.

What makes a man turn friendly ? lust for bitcoin, women or were you just born with a heart full of friendliness?

Since the ledger is public, is it possible to see just how many people actually paid for reddit gold (estimate) if we knew Reddit’s wallet address?
Sorry, I’m new to this.

 It is there not an inherent issue if the price did drop from $275k to $75k? That would mean the currency is subject to large inflation and deflation swings (I know bitcoin is inherently deflationary). If you get excited about this as an initial investment, if you got in at $5k, then yes, the $275k price would be amazing. However, the point of bitcoin is not to make money on a just speculative nature, it’s to have a secure currency that can not be tracked, a currency that is not tied to gold or anything else, correct? 
So why would you celebrate such wild swings unless you were A: shorting it, or B: speculating on it. This cannot be good for adoption to make such statements as the author made, as anyone just learning about bitcoin may see this tweet and say, “Wow, that swings possible? Unless I want to invest, this isn’t a currency, it’s a gamble.”

But that’s not yet point of bitcoin, if you want it to become mainstream, it can’t just be a cash grab. This is similar mentality to short sellers- they don’t care if the company succeeds (quite the opposite); they just want to make money. It’s the “I got mine” mentality.
If your goal is to purely make money and treat this as if you were speculating on the price of gold or something that’s fine. But with this investment strategy, it will never move bit coin beyond speculation investments.
You might as well treat bitcoin like abandon storage units. If your goal is purely to make money which for many it is, then you just buy up it is many as you can at the lowest possible price and then when it comes time to sell you see what you get. No emotional attachments no rally for success other than for personal gain.

Not the conversation I though I’d have with a man that has 30+ years bartending experience.

Sadly, not yet. Ireland seems a bit slow to change in this aspect, but he hopes to soon!
