I don't understand when people say bitcoins can't have a physical representation. Simple mode is just print the private keys on a piece of paper and uninstall your bitcoin program -- boom! you now have a physical representation of your bitcoins...
If you want to get fancy you can make 5mbitcoin or 10's or 20's or whatever and use them as money too. Sure, importing a private key could be a nuisance for the people you meet; but hopefully newer wallet software would be able to import private keys by scanning a QR-code so it would go faster. Im not sure wallets support this functionality att. Electrum doesn't seem to atleast. This point is nevertheless moot as we can use cellphones when we do a bitcoin transaction and im not so sure gold is faster to exchange &amp; appraise than writing in a string of characters anyway...
Nevertheless you can now have physical bitcoins... Youd be hard pressed to claim physical bitcoins doesn't exist anymore... All these arguments about "i need something to hold" can now be shot down. Halleluja!

How old are you?

You should go tell coinbase the same then as they also use the word chart:

When it is seen as better, more stable &amp; preferrable to nations currencies; when it starts to chip away at the notion of a nation state itself! That would be the day!!

I suppose i am a bit misinformed. Seems there are some coin-stealing malware out there. Oh well i still prefer the safety of bitcoin vs creditcard. Atleast with bitcoin i am the one that has to mess up in order to loose my money, not random company x(latest in this saga UPS if you look at the top post in this subreddit). Also im not sure how easily one is able to get these trojans &amp; keyloggers, but i suppose it is possible.

Yes, but this would lend credibility to bitcoin. If a big site have this as part of their default options more people would "trust in bitcoin". There is a chance more sellers would start to accept bitcoin too if they see others having success accepting bitcoin. And ofcourse there is the promotional value such a thing would give to bitcoin.
I thought this was obvious but i guess not. Is it rude to ask how old you are?
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:30:44
Hm. So i guess we have both been rude then, i thinking youre young or atleast wondering and you stating that i am. I'm 30 years old actually, how old are you?

Why would you leave your CC info at a gazillion different places! Stay safe! Use Bitcoin!
(;) a bit tongue in cheek here, but serious too..)
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:22:36
So? Does it make it any better? Atleast online stores get hacked all the time and peoples CC info gets stolen.
Huge retailer names that youd think got their security down get hacked. So bottom line, CC is not safe.
Not that i'm that paranoid, but it feels "cleaner" to just use bitcoin i suppose.
@_date: 2014-08-19 00:47:18
I think you're confusing things here. We were comparing buying with bitcoin vs buying with cc. I was simply stating that bitcoin were safer in that regard. I think this is indisputable. 
If you want to broaden the discussion and discuss bitcoin security vs creditcards im not so sure im that interested in that discussion to spend a lot of time on it but i guess you can say pros with bitcoin: no identity theft. cons: **if** you have it on your pc *and* is crap with computers you *could* get them stolen by malware(not sure such malware even exists at this point though). And also, **if** you are stupid/ignorant enough to leave them at an exchange/online wallet you could lose them due to hackers/theft.

If have to store 1 TB in a year that's £90 extra a month for me. Assuming i can use a normal sata. If i have to use a SSD it's £369 extra a month...
For services this is not so cool.

"Wallet functions currently run on the server, but they will be pulled into the respective SDKs." what does this mean? That you basically give your private key to a razrbit server if you want to use the send transaction option?

Since when has news been straight-up honest reporting &amp; discussion? In case you didn't know all news agencies from AP, Reuters, WP, NYT, CNN, BBC what have you have all failed the litmus test. They've consistently shown themselves to be downright fraudulent when it comes to manipulating the minds of the masses. Because of the centralization of newsagencies only a few larger actors have the capacity to be on the spot and report from where it's hot too so everyone else just follow their lead.. their bad lead. Sorry i went off on a tangent.
I'd say one of the chief functions of the media nowadays is marshal in support of wars so people won't cause too much of a ruckus when another nation gets bombed and maimed.

I just don't get your kind of mentality. Why would anyone just think of themselves? Seems like a sad and myopic way to view the world.
Maybe it's a bit rude, but i guess since you are a pleb an advantage to bitcoin for you would be to not require you to leave your contact details and CC info everywhere for hackers to get a hold of, making your tiny world a bit more secure.

This. Can confirm by trying to implement this myself. Maybe some of the higher ups can predict what the fee is going to be before they send, but i was unable to. A bit strange that something so necessary for a service is so hard to implement, but then again a lot is weird with bitcoind(bitcoin core).
edit:to be clear if i remember correctly: its hard to programmatically know what the fee will be before you send a transaction, so you set a default fee and take the always changing fee bitcoind comes up with out of that.

So you don't think it is a bit disconcerting to see the journo mentioning some fabled blog about bitcoin "which hasn't been "verified"" (and where is the link goddammit??! This is the internet, not some village in in the dark ages talking about some fabled city "out there in the mountains somewhere") where some perfectly english speaking Arab terrorists perfectly westernized ending their blog with "we ask Allah to hasten its usage for us". Bah! journalists lie. End of story.
