Wrong, you just have to accept it for debts. A Merchant can refuse to use USD because they do not have to sell to you. There is no debt involved.

I asked about the reverse bitpay a while ago myself. Its not just the regulations, charge back issues is the main problem I encountered. Bitcoin doesn't have that problem, but the dollar does. If received dollars get immediately turned into bitcoin, then what happens when there is a charge back dollar side? The reverse bit pay would eat the losses, not you. Needless to say, that's a little too risky for most.

I will accept bitcoin and litecoin, and will offer a discount for people who pay me in one of those. But I dont want to limit my audience farther by only accepting bitcoin or altcoins.

No, he is saying that bitcoin is stable because it ISN'T like that, there is no one pumping it more and more until it can no longer handle its own weight, unlike what happened in 2008. The us economy, and the economy of most governments around the world are instable because they try to artificially create stability, this creates broken system after broken system untill it all falls apart under a massive shitstorm. The difference being that, because bitcoin is allowed to succeed or fail respectively, there is a lot of small crashes and a lot of booms,  but overall economic growth. This is due to broken systems (mt.gox looking at you) being allowed to fail freely in a open market. It stings but is less damaging than what happens when artificial stability is forced over a long period of time (too big to fail banks are a example)

No, thats the definition of a successful investment. A pyramid scheme pays off earlier investors with new investors payments directly. Making money off a investment is natural, not  a scheme of any kind, where as with a ponzi scheme the only money made is by taking the investments of later investors, effectively stealing their money.

The idea i had was sort of something like paypal for accepting fiat, then my account there converts that into bitcoin and sends it to my wallet. Kind of like bitpay in reverse. That way my customers can still pay fiat if they want.

Great job! I really hope your business continues to succeed in this,way to go.

Prove me wrong then, saying I am provably wrong is not a argument, you have to actually say the argument in order to be valid.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:06:14
No, most An-caps don't believe in large scale democracy like you suggest, direct or not. They believe free market forces and normal social pressures should dictate things in society, not governments.
I suggest you read up on An-cap arguments, or for that matter, arguments from any anarchistic group. If you dont agree, than you have just solidified your position.

I understand that risk, I am fully prepared to pay out of pocket for this. One way to mitigate that risk is to automatically deduct the amount I owe from future buys, that way I shoulder the risk. Of course I would be plenty willing to pay for any damages that service has due to charge back issues myself.

The only problem with this, is that as a game designer my income from this wouldn't be a fixed amount. In addition, I am a seller of goods, so my income would come from many different sources

I completely forgot about google wallet, maybe I could use their service in stead of a bank, I'll have to look into it, as I am not experienced with google wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-19 07:51:33
I looked at that. But it doesn't seem to fulfill my needs. For one, it doesn't accept credit cards, which many of my customers will want to use.

This is correct in the US at least, it might be different for different countries.

I disagree. Altcoins are in no way affecting the supply of bitcoin, so saying one can inflate the other is wrong. Its like saying that another currency in the world will inflate the dollar (beyond whats already being done). I believe alts are necessary to the health of cryptos as a whole, as if everyone uses two or three cryptocurrencies, then if one were to fall do to some reason or another (say a 51% attack by a malicious entity) it would mean that we wouldn't be affected nearly as bad as if we had all our eggs in the one basket, so to speak. In addition to that, i use both litecoin and feathercoin as a way to keep my value from fluctuating rapidly, moving value from one currency to another when things start looking unstable.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:01:37
Thank you for specifics,  and I do see your points. I agree on most of what you said, but I dont agree with putting all the resources into one crypto, even thought it would make the crypto stronger. Its kind of like investing in a single thing and hoping things work out and be lucky. I believe in that old saying of not putting all your eggs in one basket. In addition, if no one uses alts at all, then where is that competition, what happens when a alt does have significant improvements, but no one wants to use it because only bitcoin is used? It means problems, as with all systems where there is no competition, stagnates, rather than get better or finding a better system. Sorta like how the majority of people don't want to get into bitcoin, especially early on. I think bitcoin would of caught on a lot faster if many competing currencies were allowed to compete in the open market, rather than stagnating with the normal USD. 
If you have a counter argument to that I'd love to hear it, unlike creationists I'm perfectly happy to be proven wrong.

This or coinbase repeating buys are what I plan on should I have to resort to banks, but I would like to not deal with banks for a number of reasons. See my edit for my big issue with banks.

@_date: 2014-01-19 08:04:39
I'm looking for a payment processor that will handle that part for me, that's the point of the question. The idea is that i never hold the fiat, it goes directly to the service and converts it to bitcoin for me.

As someone who is severely colorblind, could you tell me which is larger dogecoin or litecoin? They look the same to me.

If I remember right, marijuana is actually a form of Mexico-native tobacco, that got turned to mean cannabis thanks to ignorant propaganda in the early 1800's. I might be wrong as I am too lazy to look it up right now, if i am feel free to correct me with citations.

Hell, for anywhere with a major economic crisis. I bet people would be flocking to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-19 18:21:26
Currently it is possible to buy pretty well anything using bitcoins, either directly or indirectly. I understand what's behind bitcoin too, but not what is behind the US dollar, besides massive debt. Moreover, most of my purchases besides taxes, bills, groceries, and gas, is done online. That makes bitcoin a far superior option than credit card.

I am not currently accepting anything right now. That's why I posted this here.
I want some options for this, I will keep this in mind for when I do start, but I would prefer some sort of system where I can completely cut out the bank as a middleman for getting bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:07:57
They make a basic fallacy in their first point, about it not being legal tender. Being legal tender has nothing to do with accepting goods and services, legal tender just concerns public debts (and in most cases private as well) Which is to say, if you owe for a debt, the creditor must accept legal tender as payment, most goods you buy are not debts and can refuse "legal tender" as they are merely offers for a transaction. In addition, there is no law saying you cannot pay off debts with something other than legal tender, its just that they can choose to not accept it as payment for your debt, where as legal tender must be accepted.
In his second point he refers to bitcoin as simply a investment opportunity. I would argue that bitcoin is much more than just a investment opportunity. In addition, if you look at the volatility of some smaller governments currency, you can see that many are even more volatile than bitcoin. Besides the more people that get into using bitcoin, the more stable it will becomes.

I have not used coinbase as of yet, and am fairly unfamiliar with it. But, like i said in my previous comment, I would like to cut out the hassle of the bank from getting bitcoin, while still accepting normal fiat.
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:44:37
There is significant risk with charge backs by banks. But with my particular situation, I am fully willing for them to shift the risk onto me. That being said I'm tempted to try and contact coinbase about this.

I dont agree with DRM personally. Just look to GOG.com (good old games). None of the games there have DRM, and yet they still make a profit. So i call BS on the concept of DRM. In addition, ill provide a free version on pirate bay for any games i make, although with a little guilt trip animation at the start. To me its free advertising, and i don't want potential costumers to get a virus on a fake :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 04:21:21
Yes, but they are not accepting money from many sources into your one account. You don't control your customers, but if you do it yourself they can simply close your account. It is significantly more risky.
I wonder though, maybe you could convince someone to do it if you pay insurance on it, to mitigate the risks...
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:55:22
Yes you can, a customer isn't paying off a debt so to speak, this is more of an offer of exchange, which either person can withdraw from the transaction at any point prior to transaction, regardless of reason. A debt literally means debt, the costumer doesnt owe anything to the merchant. You would be right if they were billing for a months service (a cell phone bill, taxes, etc.) But since this is just a offer of transaction, there is no debt. Hince it is completely legal to refuse a dollar for goods.

Only for debts. If you are buying goods upfront there is no debt and they can choose what to accept or not. So you can legally pay off a loan with pennies and they can't say no without abolishing your debt. However for point-of-sell that doesn't matter, as you never accrue debt, merely an exchange.
