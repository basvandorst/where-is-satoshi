Exactly why I'm not dumping all my money into bitcoin. I keep maybe $100 worth at any time for the few things that are easier with bitcoin.

I believe bitcoin is a revolutionary idea. However, it is easily replaceable and I could easily see something similar taking over ie something government regulated

Gold isn't worthless....
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:48:15
Holy fucking shit. "Nobody uses gold, for anything"
What good is a bitcoin? The programming behind it and the people using it. It can easily be replaced by another cryptocurrency. In the end, a bitcoin has no actual use value. At least gold has properties that make it desirable in industry.
Now, I believe Bitcoin has it's place with the internet age we are in today, but if the internet ceased to exist, Bitcoin would be useless.

I can see how bitcoin has value the same way as gold, usd, euro, etc have value. 
What do you think about the massive value increase over the past year? I've just been getting into bitcoin, but the little time I've spent researching I have seen people and businesses practicing poor financial fundamentals, to put it nicely. I have also seen a good bit of intelligence too, but it seems like the user base is maybe half and half.

No, not at all. I was pointing out that when the dude said that gold was useless, it was one of the worst statements I've ever heard.
Bitcoin is useful today and I think we are better off with it. However, we'd be ok without it. If bitcoin tanked tomorrow it really wouldn't be a big deal. If someone destroyed all the gold tomorrow, it'd be a huge fucking deal.
I'm for bitcoins. I am not for saying gold is useless, that is entirely retarded.

Storing your bitcoins on google drive would obviously make them vulnerable to whatever shortcomings google drive has. How do you feel about google drive and storing bitcoins on google drive?
