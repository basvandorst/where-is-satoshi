Really interesting stuff. Also great job on taking Bitcoin. I hope it's a success.
(sorry, this is all I have left in my tip account)

Yep. Just use cash and deposit at CVS or Walmart

[coinius.com]( will have guides pretty soon. (and Bitcoin POS systems!)
I'll be the first to admit though, bitpay is the way to go right now, especially if you want to be paid in USD.

Being attractive is pretty easy with bootstrap.

This guy must be super rich. Regular people don't throw away $13,000 just to test something.

I couldn't agree more. I'm 18 now, but when I was 11 or 12 I wanted to learn as much as I could about tech stuff. Honestly, learn as much as you can right now. Pick something like graphic design or programming and run with it. All your friends will be making minimum wage at their jobs at 16/17, and if you really know your stuff you will be making a ton more. Anyways, I never wanted anything dumbed down, I just wanted to learn how to use it.

This is great! And thanks for providing the source, so people can have confidence in using it.

This is huge. I can't wait to start tipping more.

Dude that's great. Best of luck to you.

All those sites are probably using the Bootstrap framework. It makes stuff so much easier.

Oh absolutely. They wouldn't let me spend my own money on Bitcoins. I knew the risk, and I've always accepted that losing everything is a very real possibility.

I asked my parents to buy bitcoins when I was 15. Well, I'm 18 now, and I'm sure you can figure out how much I regret not pushing them more.

I totally see where you are coming from, and it was probably the right thing for them to do. They were kinda blown away when I told them the thing I wanted to buy for $5 a few years ago is now $130.
