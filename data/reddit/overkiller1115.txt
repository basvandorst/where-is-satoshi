It most likely will because its a platform for other projects like BAT and power ledger. Im sure some eth tokens will be around. Don't really see why people see ethereum as a competitior. They are not there to replace bitcoin, not even to be a mainstream currency.

Litecoin, bch, IOTA (one of my favorite scalability coin) and private stuff like Zcash. Just because bitcoin isnt a good micro transaction coin doesnt mean we wont be able to use crypto. Bitcoin is for storing money, other coins are for using them.

Agree, and we have altcoins that can provide privacy, like Monero and Zcash. The problem is that a lot of people wont use it of it is illegal, even if it is compleatly private. I would be sad if that happens because Im for more open borders and more trade because I feel like we humans live on this planet toghether and we should work as humans and not as countries. Thats just my opinion but crypto opens up for boarderless transactions without banks setting stop for it. Something I like ;)

I think the idea is that people who are able to use LN will use it and unload the network. But as you said not a solution because as the network grows, the amount of people who dont use LN will also rise. And as we know, Bitcoin can still only handle 3 transactions per second.

They are meant to have the value they require to run the network. Oil doesng have a value because people buy stuf with it, it has a value brcause we need it to drive our cars. Its the same thing with eth tokens. 
Eth tokens is worth as much as the ethereum ecosystem is worth. If noone use ut, the tokens is worth nothing. If people use it, it has a value. Again, the day no one needs the oil and can use renewable recorces instead, the oil will be worthless. 
Cant say i the eth tokens has the "right" value now but as long as the system is used, eth yokens have a value

1 Download a BITCOIN wallet. 
"A Bitcoin wallet is an app or program that allows you send and receive BCH." 
2 Add bitcoin CASH to you wallet...........

And I know the Chinese government isn't really that easy to work with and isn't really trustworthy imo.

Hope you understand that we WANT inflation and that's why  the úsd and other fiat has lost a lot of "value". It benefits the economy. They don't want us to just hold them, they want to get it as tax (so the state can buy stuff for it), that we buy something for it or that we invest in companies. It does not benefit the economy to just hold usd, its much better to invest in a company so they can buy a new machine.

I TOTALLY agree that we shall not blame crypto, we shall blame the coal.and I gre, we are moving forward even if we have taken a step back now because of a certain president eho deasn't give a fuck about our planet. Anyways, read that there have been build solar farm in the United Arab Emiretes because it is more profitable. My only point was really that we may not only need to consume less energy until we have great renewable sources and bitcoin mining consumes a lot of energy. Still think bitcoin i s something that is eorth spending energy on but it is worth to keep in mind. I also think bitcoin will switch from pow at some point but we shall wait until we have a BETTER alternative. Pos can be domething for bitcoin too but we dont know exactly if it works yet. Hopefully we dont get a centralized bitcoin that rund on like 7 big nodes (neo).

Agree and disagree. The situation in zcash is eorse when it comes to per cent but feel like the community holds togheter more that in bitcoin where different people wants to go in different directions even if no one wants to kill it.

Must be a hell of a job to declare all transactions after a year and compare it with the current fiat value. Tvat is at least how it works here in Sweden.

@_date: 2018-03-01 22:36:33
Thab tell me why we wouldnt want to have it. If it is because you have held a lot of fiat for s long time is not that a valid argument. Fiat currency is a something we pay with, not a store of value. Period.
If you use your money correctly, inflation should not be a problem. Save in good stocks, gold and real estate. And maybe crypto if you want to be exposed to this market (which you should imo). Just use your fiat how it is meant to be used, a liquid asset that you buy syuff with. You should spend it, that is what inflation tells you to do.
Maybe I have missed something so feel free to tell me. Just saying that If someone has lost money because he or she held fiat for 20 years, that person has done something wrong. Again, hold is a stabile asset if that is what you seek.
 
Also, make sure to invest in something that beats the inflation

I think this article is very missleading, at least the part about that your money is at risk snd that banks could go bankrupt at any time. Dont know about other contries but here in Sweden, banks have extreamly tough regulations they need to follow. They have to prove they their economy works, ALWAYS have enough liquidity for you to take out huge ammounts of cash at any time. You just have to wait a day for the banks to prepare the cash. While it may be possible to loose money in a bank, its basicly zero compired to storing cash or private keys on you own

Inflation is something that have been beneficial for the economy, otherwise we would not have it.

because giving Nasa actually benefits the economy while hodling your money does not. If giving Nasa all the money is the best priority if an other question.

1. Im not american and in my country its PRIMARLY up to you to prove where your money comes from. This is ONLY when it comes to money laundering because it can be almost impossible for someone to prove where cash comes from. Right or wrong is an opinion.
And do not say people have forgotten their rights. If you are following the lay, that you need to do anyways, that should not be a problem. If you want to change this, use your rights to maybe seek support in an election or spread your word and why. But because a majority directly or indirectly supports the current laws, you need to follow it. 
I do not tkow the laws in other countries but i would guess its similar because the anti mobey launderinglaws are often international. And again its easy for you to prove thay your money is legal. Just look back at the blockchain anz ypu can proove it was a mining reward. Dobt know how the laws ate in the us, that is up to you guys to know.

Going back and reading whitepapers helps me. Read rhe zcash one a while ago and it made me feel better.
I think better infrastructure if far more wortv than the current price. A bitcoin atm in every town like fiat atms is a wet dream for me.
Just think about this: its you turn to buy some crypto.
What do you want to buy?  Btc, eth, ltc or zcash?
Choosing btc...
Thank you, do you want something more?
Choosing eth and putting it $15.
Do you want to convert them into any erc20 token?

I said bitcoin has no support for smart contracts, not that some sidechain wont have it.
RSK has really not that much to do with bitcoin. Its pegged and uses btc as currency but thesmart contracts is not executed by the miners but by bussiness nodes. Im neutral on it, just saying that its definstly not the same as bitcoin. 
Please correct me if im wrong but rsk isnt even really decentralized as far as I have understood. Your bitcoins are helf bu stakeholders and you cant become one. For me, it seemd like keeping tokens on an exange and the network is ran on centralized nodes

Just annoyed about when people says that the current system is horreble and says crypto will take over the eorld snd you should hate the government.

That is a truth with modification. While bitcoin still have the most computing power (I think), the hashrate are not a good measurement because if different hash algorithms and bitcoin for example not being ASIC resistant. 
Yes bitcoin has the most computing power but it is much more centralized than for example ethereum. Not saying bitcoin is bad, look at Bcash! My biggest problem with bitcoin is that we have mining farms in China. One farm is not that many percents but like 70% of the hash power is in china. Ethereum on the other hand is ASIC resistant and everyone can mine with a gaming computer and turn a profit. that makes the hash power much more distributed. 
Hate to compare bitcoin and ethereum because they are different projects and are not trying to accomplish the same thing. They are also likely the two best ones when it comes to decentralization. Again look at bcash, almost no one runs an node nowdays because the blocksize. Of course its the miners that confirm transactions but still

Exactly, someone can just print a bunch of usd or euro or sek any fiat and cause hyper inflation. Good luck with printing more bitcoins just like that....

Cant predict the future but eth and ltc have held the price betger in the near past (monts) 
Its also imo likely the bitcoin at some piont loses the  and than some alt will get the bitcoin role. If that happena and what that means for the price is anyones guess. What I know is that eth held much better than btc in the last big crash compared to ath. Ltc has also been strong.
What I know is that in the last crash,eth had its lowest point between 55 to 60%below ath while bitcoin had it between 65 to 70.
Also ltc is now like 30% below ath.
Can say if thrmet is because "weak hands" mainy bought bitcoin or if people believe more in the technology. Its anyone guess but thats just some data.
My point is that this could be a new trend and what has happened i  the pask can happen again. Or something else happens. We could have gone in to a new era of crypto where other cryptos too have become most of a leader and bitcoins role as the only one is gone. My guess but my guess is as good as yours

Hope you understandbwhy we have inflation and why they are printing more fiat. Its not because they are evil, its because that creates economical growth. We want people to spend money and buy stuff. That leads to new jobs for example.

Unfortunatly its a second layer solution that doesn't really work that want many people think it do. And everyone will defiantly dont use it even if it may unload the network. You need to make a transaction an advance to use the LN. The receiver needs to use the LN... As long as bitcoin can only handle 3 transactions per second it will not work as a payment system. 
Also remember that bitcoin (and the rest of the cryptos too) it to "advanced" for a lot of people even if you and I know how to use it. Defiantly to hard if we want people to not use centralized online wallets. The public key is a pain in the ass to handle without a qr scanner...
And dont be so toxic. We dont only want bitcoin to be big, we want crypto to be big. And like or dont like eth but it helps blockchain to be bigger and are not there to take over bitcoin. Eth is a platform while bitcoin is a polayment system and a store of value.

Im 17 and are not an expert but I understand that what he is saying is bullshit. I do not find it weird at all that we have inflation. The governments does not want the money as cash under our pillow. 
1. They want it as investment that means companies get more money and can employ more people. 
2. That want us to buy products or services that also gives the companies and the investments worth something. 
3. They want it as tax so they can build up infrastructure (means jobs and a better society) or schools so we can educate people to take future jobs. 
What will not be beneficial is for example, bad relationships with other people/countries, mistrust and high inequality (making the poor less poor and not killing wealth) and of course not using as deflationary asset as the main currency in a country that tells people to keep the money under their pillow. 
It's a shame that people lack so much knowledge and throwing shit on the system without knowing what they are talking about (or rather something they read on reddit/twitter). This makes me so mad :/

Ethereum is a working product, yes. Is it a finished product no. Thats not bitcoin either. Bitcoin can still only handle 3 transactions per second.. NO cryptos are a finished product at this time. Stores like Steam leave bitcoin because its not working as it is meant to do. End of bitcoin, no.

Google isnt selling information as people think. The information is much more valuble if they keep it for them selves. The same goes for other internet giants.
If you think apple isnt collecting information in a world where mass information has become morw and more valuble, good for you and you can stop here. 
We dont know ecacrly what anyone collects and what im most worried about is security breaches and thet my information insyead end up in the hands of criminals. This can happen with any company.

Nah, its bitcoin who is 6 years BEHIND altcoins. And yes most altcoins are much much much better that bitcoin. Bitcoin is and will be successful for other reasons. 
And yes bitcoin and cryptocurrency can be banned. they can just shut down and ban exanges and shops who use it and almost no one will be interested in crypto. While its is possible to own bitcoin and that want stop the network, people will still not use it because that dont want to do something criminal.

You have a very good point. If you can "mine" every coin at the same time, what makes one special. That's something to think about and I dont have an complete answer but I don't think that it will be a huge problem tho. We need to think about what gives a coin value. Its not really what the miners mine but what we support. With pos, you can mine every coin (after a hardfork) at the same but the coins will likely be worthless because mining those doesn't mean anything and the coin people will use the "real one". Its exactly how it works today really with bitcoin cash. Miners can switch back and forth as much as they want and that hasn't stopped bitcoin from having like a 7 times as big market cap. And bch is an VERY successful hardfork. Get what you mean with different algorithms but thats pretty hard to setup. People can still make a sha256 coin. And asic miners are in my opinion a big loss against decentralization because it require people to buy a specific hardware and have the money to do so. Something that supports hugh mining farms. My dream when it comes to POW is that everyone mines with their laptop for a non profit reason. What will likely not happen but the probability is likely bigger in a POS system (if we have POS mining pools). Than people can hopefully put ther money in it with almost no effort. We shall also remember Ethereum is meant to be a platform so the value is less important for the system. 
Cant really say if pos is better than pow. None of them is really tested enough yet. We know that pow works for not but we haven't reached a critical point yes when the power consumption is to big, something that may be a serious problem in a world that need to be more energy efficient. That a lot of the mining energy comes from coal doesn't help either. We should also not forget that creating a ton of computers is not environment friendly. Not only talking about energy consumption nut also rare metals that we need for them. Creating a ton of new ASICs every year isn't really a good idea.  
POS system could be a energy efficient system that can beat tradition systems. But but but, we dont know yet. Its always good to have a healthy discussion about this kind of stuff, we are still only in the beginning of this new era. Maybe is non of the systems we have today good enough, someone may post a super smart system tomorrow and beat all of the current systems. Such a exciting time to be alive :)

Would say crypto is still a extremly niche bordering experiment. Most prople doesnt care about crypto. Paypal works fine for them. They dont care if a bank handels the money. If they forget their password, they can just get a new one. Today, we have tax regulations that makes it hard to use crypto legally. You need to save the transactions and and pay tax for profits. For most people, ising crypto is not worth it. And who wants to put their money in an asset with this much volatility if it is not an investment. Im very bullish on bitcoin and some good altcoins but lets face it, we are almost where we where back than. 
Unfortunatly after this crash, a lot of people has lost their money and will probably never toutch crypto again.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:19:31


I really hate that bitcoin and bitcoin cash is using the same pow algorithm. Than only makes some greedy miners switch back and forth, something that is not good for neither bitcoin or bcash. 
It would be much better if bitcoin miners mined bitcoin and bch miners mined bch. 
You can argue that this is a problem for all asic resisten coins too (switch algorithm on your gpus fast) but gpu mining is done is smaller scale so it doesn't really matter. Its like moving 3 antminers. The problem with bitcoin is that we have HUGH mining farms that have a hugh hashrate and can fuck up block confirmation times.  
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:16:12
Okay, centralization is not something we need more off..... not being asic resistant is bad enough. And so there are really no problemd with 2mb or maybe 4 but I agree that it is not a sustaiable solution. Really dont know what to do if blockcain size in not a solution. LN will likely cut away many transaction from big players but people still neeed to open upp the channels.

Vitalik is a developer and the face of Ethereum but that does not mean centralization. Everything if community driven and people like what he and his team does most of the time, but if the community disagrees (its we who choose if the coin has any value) with him, there is nothing he can do. And that how it should be and was what happened with the Ethereum classic fork. Bitcoin has the same "problem" in the end of the day. If everyone hated the implementation of segwit for example, the developers could try ti get it out as much as they want but they need the support of the community. The same with bcash. Some people wanted bigger blocksize (bad solution imo) so they forked the chain and found some support. What the core developers of bitcoin thought didn't matter. 
With that said, Vitalik may have a too big influence but its likely necessary because etherum is still under development and is far from finished. 
Wounder what would happen if nakamoto came out of the shadow and said exactly where he wanted bitcoin to go. Would he find support, would people just ignore it, would someone kill him. would bitcoin become worthless because he may still have the private keys to insanely big amounts of btc. Not comparing him to Vitalik, just interesting to think about.

My point was that mist people was interested because the rise in price. That was probably the reason KFC joined, they did it for marketing and not because of bitcoin. Payments in bitcoins is pretty much pointless when they just turn it in to fiat the moment theh get it. 
We need to wait until the point when people pay eachother in bitcoins and we have prices based on bitcoin, not the currennt fiat value of bitcoin.
We are not there yet but im sure that time will come then people wake up doesn't tolerate the stupidly high power of banks and the lack of privacy in a cashless world.
I think platform coins like Ethereum will be used on a big scale before bitcoin. We can almost already make dapps and they can be really powerful. We ca  have a world where we trust code on a decentralized blockchain onstead of giving away all the power to internet  giants. The same will happen with bitcoin and and money but it make take some time.
I think we need to wait until people wake up and get the problems we have and then find the power of crypto by themselves.

Its right with an "and". The fees will be high to get a transaction going though the network AT ALL. During peak time, using a transaction fee low enough is with other words not possible. And because just going with the race for the highes transaction fee is not possible for a lot of use cases (and not sustainable) it at absolutly fair to say that bitcoin is slow AND expensive during peak time.

Let me correct one thing. Eth is not a bitcoin killer, will never be a bitcoin killer and are not even meant to be a bitcoin killer. They are meant to work together to make blockchain technology great. 
Bitcoin benefit from a strong Eth (not only talking about value) ETh benefits from a strong btc. They are building up a decentralized system that is transparent and open for everyone on this planet. That much more valuble that bitcoin itselves. or ethereum or litecoin or IOTA or ANY other coin.
