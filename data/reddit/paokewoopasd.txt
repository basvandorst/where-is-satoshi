Have I understood this correctly? 
Say the blockchain forks because some full node clients are operating on a new set of rules. 
Before that happened, there was one historical blockchain. 
After it happens, the blockchain is split, with those clients operating to the new rules building one chain, the clients still using the old rules building another chain, but both sets of clients have a shared history of the blockchain from before the fork happened.  
So coins in the blockchain from before the fork are potentially spendable twice? - in the new chain with those using that one, and in the old chain with those using that, because these two chains would not be recognising each other, but both would recognise coins from before the split happened? 
That sounds like a major problem if I've understood correctly.  
Going forward I guess it could create two Bitcoins - Bitcoin A and Bitcoin B - but what about all the coins in the old chain from before the fork happened which would seem to be spendable in both systems?
Can anyone advise on this?

On the subject of being grateful to the Core Devs I'd like to post the link below.  I think it's a great idea to have the opportunity for us to show our gratitude by donating to them.

Don't worry, there's plenty of nutter images of fiat currency devotees as well:
