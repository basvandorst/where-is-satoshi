@_date: 2019-07-20 14:46:01
as I said, just curious how long you'll keep this up and how important the last word is to you
@_date: 2019-07-09 10:36:47
tbh, I was more like you when I was closer to being a teenager. the pedantry, the need to argue the fine details with people who mostly agree.
I grew up when I stopped wasting my time writing essays on reddit and learning things instead. You'll reply to this though, you need the last word. These kind of sites are an unhealthy addiction for the bugman-inclined.
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:23:30
But I didn't, that's the point
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:55:26
I wonder how long you'll keep responding if I automate the process of replying to you.
@_date: 2019-07-29 10:43:47
Prove me wrong then, prove that the last word is more important to me than you. That's the only way you can win, by not replying. I think it would be too painful for you though.
@_date: 2019-07-09 10:14:29
You can't help yourself, can you? Even though I've stated I'm not even reading your replies.
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:26:15
you couldn't resist, even though you knew by replying you were proving me right. it was too painful to let me have the last word. still haven't read more than the first sentence.

I stopped reading more than the first sentence a few essays ago.

You don't understand, not reading your screeds is actually the act of self control. It takes self control not to. Reading and responding line by line and getting into endless pendantic reddit-discussions instead of doing something interesting, that's the lazy path.
I'm more interested to see how long you'll keep responding even though that anything you write beyond the first line, I don't read... and no-one else is too cos this is an old thread.

\&gt; Right. US-based and owned by an American company. I didn’t mean to suggest otherwise
So what? This subreddit is an international community where Americans are in the minority, it's reasonable for people to adapt to each other. In fact it's actually just really, really weird just how much some Americans kick and scream and get deeply offended when you suggest any kind of "hey here's a reasonable compromise that doesn't involve everyone else in the world bending over backwards to maintain the illusion that there are only americans on the internet". It bellies a kind of deep insecurity, which is kind of weird given your nation's total domination of most of the cultural and geopolitical spheres of influence on the planet.
\&gt;You need to stop editing your posts after I respond to them. That’s one standard I think we can all agree on.
I actually haven't, it's likely that you've responded while I've made my edit.


You can't accuse me of this without also being guilty of it. I actually also think it's slightly pathetic how personally you've taken this. YYYY-MM-DD... you even still get to write MM before DD, if that's so important.
Ask yourself why this upsets you so much?

Now, the question is, do you know why I keep replying?

shhhhh. there's no need to get upset
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:04:13
It doesn't. People believe that price follows hashrate. Hashrate actually follows price. That's why the hashrate actually reduced in early 2014. This incrase in hashrate is just still catching up in the massive increase of value over the past 18 months.
That said, we might currently be bottoming out. It's always v hard to know except in retrospect.
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:52:46
This is actually another good argument for YYYY-MM-DD, because if you put HH:MM:SS after it then it has the pleasing property of increasing in order of magnitude from right to left like regular numbers.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:30:54


We need standards. If you see 04/05/2018, what date is that? The correct answer is: you don't know. It's either a non-american using the internationally recognised format, or it is an American assuming that all English speakers on the net are American. Both are sources of ambiguity.
The "when in Rome" argument fails too, since there are more non-US native English speakers than there are US native English speakers.
If this were then yeah, by all means, use the weird US date format. Otherwise, it's much safer to use YYYY-MM-DD.
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:26:20


Because you were just being pedantic and not really offering anything worth debating. Believe me I could have spent many essays debating whatever nitpicky bullshit you wanted to throw out, but I've learnt not to do that. I've wasted enough hours of my life on this site debating people like you.
Your argument: "muh interpretation of the constitution means the laws the are actually enforced and which the supreme court has not challenged aren't the real laws, the real laws are the ones that conform to my interpretation of what the laws should be, and in that universe, I'm right".
That argument is literally too dumb to argue with. Someone who makes that argument is arguing in bad faith and not worth talking to. And like a lot of redditors, you're just going to waffle and engage in pedantry to try to disguise that.


Oh no, what an offence against decorum.
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:15:44


Again, you're tacitly admitting my time is more valuable than yours.
The conversation was over here. Writing a load of waffle in response is just outstaying your welcome and was just about trying to bully me into keeping debating you. (You'll deny this now cos you'll take issue with the wording, but you've repeatedly stated this is your goal).
I chose not to play your game and informed you that I was no longer reading your responses. You've now spent a month throwing a tantrum about that fact, sealioning me, and petulantly refusing to allow the conversation to end, projecting your own negative traits onto me (namely that I'm a bully).
And here I am, still here, laughing at you for your astonishing lack of self-awareness.
That's why I'm still here, because it's hillarious. You're the living embodiment of a redditor stereotype: A loser in his 40s who spends every day shouting "AKHCHUALLY" at people.

\&gt; In America it is April 5. In Europe it is May 4.
So, if I say that something happened on 04/05/2018, then that means that the timeline split in two, and for american readers, it actually did happen in april, and for everyone else, it happened in may?
That clearly isn't the case. It means we have an \*\*ambiguity\*\* caused by you country's ridiculous date format. So, I recommend, as a compromise, using YYYY-MM-DD (which, amusingly it's only americans going "THAT'S UNREASONABLE" even though the rest of the world have a stronger case for saying "it's unreasonable, that you guys with the minority, weird, illogical date format are insisting we use it online, in international communities").

No, I said I do that in that window, the actual replying takes 10 seconds max and is a moment of amusement in time where I'm blocked from further productive work.
Your disjointed attempts to ~~avoid~~ force conversation is really a waste and vapid in their nature. I enjoy that, causing you to shout to the wind.
FYI if I wanted to "avoid conversation" I'd just stop replying. Wouldn't bother me to let you have the last word, I've just been enjoying how much it bothers you.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:01:33


Here is the root of the problem. It isn't an "American" forum. It's a "US-based" forum. This subreddit in particular is an international online community. You're in the minority. Sorry, but it's true.
The internet doesn't care about your borders. You go on the internet and enter an international discussion forum, then it's reasonable to expect the people within it to meet in the middle. Not just "murica, fuck you, adopt everything of ours and I'll accuse you of having a napoleonic complex otherwise".

I check reddit a couple of times a week. Each time I have a reply full of projection and butthurt sent like 30m to a few hours after the last message, this is just amusing to me. You're in your 40s and wasting your time on reddit. Get married and have kids man, there's more to life. Trust me.
Someone is upset and frustrated by these exchanges, it's not me. This is a source of consistent amusement for me. I respond, it takes me a second or two, I forget for a few days to a week... and you reply, seething, every time.
Why on earth would I take the time to write a bot? (Unless the project was a learning exercise cos I wanted to learn the reddit API anyway). I'd just use a pre-made one.
The hillarious thing is that you said you'd also automate your responses to my bot (even though you know I'd never see it).
Damn, you made me write a full response, I bet you'll take this as some sort of victory and totally miss the fact that I'm giving you some good advice: obsessively refreshing reddit to reply to petty disagreements on reddit is a waste of the precious little time you have here.
@_date: 2019-08-04 12:03:30
btw the best response if you wanted to  "troll the troll" would have been "I only read the first sentence, stop writing essays to me".
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:26:05
My point is, since you don't seem to understand nuance.
If I deploy a bot to just mark your message as read and comment some pithy remark, then what does it matter whether you write a bot to reply to my bot... I'll never know whether you did or not.
The only purpose it would serve would be to soothe the horrible itchy feeling you'd get from not having the last word.  It would allow you to feel like "you've won" without doing anything that affects me in any way. It's kind of pathetic.
I don't actually intend to do it, it's more of a thought experiment to see how important the last word is to you: i.e. that you would still take the time to set up a bot to shout into the void even though I'd never see it.
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:14:53
Should also be YYYY-MM-DD since that's the only non-internationally-ambiguous format, the US is the only country to use that weird date format, and is an international community.

Also, the hilarious thing about your "it's worth my time to waste yours" stance is that that's a tacit admission that your time is less valuable than mine.

Not most of Africa no, but the majority of people in Nigeria and Kenya and several others speak it. A very large number of people in south Africa too.
I guess the definition of "native" vs "second" might be stricter than I'm using.
Certainly, in terms of people who use English daily within their own country, and have spoken it since childhood (even if not primary home language), there are enormously more than native US English speakers.
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:48:41
I don't believe that that is true. There are many many native English speakers in Africa and India.
But it is a superficial disagreement and we seem to be in agreement on the main point.

Because those aren't international forums. And you don't catch me complaining about the use of dollars. Dollars \*are\* an international standard. They're a fixed point that we largely guage other currencies by. In the same way as I'm not complaining about the use of the English language: it is an international standard. I am complaining about the US date format though, because it isn't. It has nothing to do with ownership of the website, and everything to do with population of the community. Websites like this are \*designed\* to be international.
It's like the one thing where the international standard isn't "what the US uses anyway". Stop being such a baby about it.
If you can find a single mention anywhere in the wiki etc that r/Bitcoin is actually the "US Bitcoin Reddit Community" then I'll concede your point. It isn't there though, because this sub is the general, international Bitcoin reddit community. The people talking in Spanish on Twitter? Should they be switching to English because it's a US company? If not why not? It's the same argument.

As long as there is a route (via open channels\*) between A and B then A can pay B (that's the "network" aspect).
This kind of routing is a "hard" problem though, and we'll have to see how things scale, but it's all very exciting stuff.
\* the channels must have enough funds to route your payment. The payment can be split across many routes though.

This isn't even true. There are plenty of countries with stronger property rights than the US.
As I said, eminent domain laws exist. There are countries that don't have this. Just the absence of eminent domain laws means that that country has stronger property rights tbh. That's how egregious a violation of property rights those laws are.
This is mainly "muh land of the free" memeing by Americans. There are (not lots, but some) countries that are freer than the US nowadays in most categories you care to define it by. There was a time where the US led the world in freedom and respect for property rights. Those days are (sadly) gone.
You're a heavily taxed, heavily regulated, social democracy like the west of the West in most regards.
I should probably admit (to show this isn't a my team vs your team thing) that both the country I'm from and the one I live in are less free than the US.

This is a total meme, this US isn't close to being the country with the strongest property rights. There are plenty of countries without things like eminent domain laws or property taxes (which essentially mean all land is rented from the state, and if you don't pay your rent, it goes back to the state).
