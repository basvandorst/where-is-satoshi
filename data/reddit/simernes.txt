Unfortunately no. What you guys are saying makes a lot of sense so I might have misunderstood something I read. I wanted to ask to see if anyone knew what I was talking about, but it might just be that I somehow got the wrong idea.

That's good. If those arab kings or whatever flying their 100 gold lambos to London every other weekend for a laugh start putting their money into bitcoin, I'd say the fight is over.

What? I'm just saying OP can at least salvage the bcash
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:39:20
That's fair. But you can't really do anything about people wanting to push their own brand, and I think this goes to show that using bitcoin in its raw form is not really ready for widespread end users. Furthermore if the way to combat misinformation campaigns like this is to demand that bitcoin cash proponents stops tricking people, I don't think it will get very far. It's such a painfully stereotypical thing to say, but maybe the best way to avoid problems like that is to develop systems that make that sort of thing obsolete, where users who don't know what they're doing aren't as easily susceptible to losing funds. In the end I think those who understand and care about what gives the in my opinion "real" bitcoin is the decentralization and new tech that takes time to develop to keep it light weight. To expect normal people to even give enough of a fuck to take a stand on that, and not just do whatever is the easiest and what everyone else is doing is a little bit ignorant.
What we should hope for in the future is that people who care and are educated in the matter, and (might be the same people) people who provide payment services to end users see that Bitcoin is the better technology, for many things but mostly relevant to this case as a backbone to provide safe, secure, and easy to use ways of paying to the end users.
It's so obvious for anyone who cares to take a look that Bitcoin is so much more valuable than Bitcoin Cash, so the ones worried about it must be partly so because they're invested and care about short term gains. Bitcoin Cash is just a shitty hack to solve scaling problems right at the moment and postpone a real solution at the cost of significant technical debt.
Ok sorry I may have gotten a little bit off topic there, but I think it's important to realize that bitcoin is so far from production ready as a payment system for average Joes that it's irresponsible to advise unknowing people like that user of yours to use it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:29:17
I'm a little confused though.. While I definitely think there is a misinformation campaign that seems to say the least malicious, don't both use the same address scheme, so you could just import the private key of your bitcoin wallet into a bitcoin cash client and have control of the coins, right?
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:24:21
I think I read some criticism on schnorr signatures that would make it harder for simple transactions to go through because it would make transactions without aggregated signatures cost a lot of money as big actors batch huge transactions together in a new way, or something like that. Sorry for my ignorance and stupid way of explaining it, if it even makes sense at all, but is there any valid reason to be concerned that schnorr signatures might contribute to centralization by making on chain transactions for normal people unaffordable?

Well, making spamming expensive is a way to control spam I guess, but it also makes legitimate transactions expensive too. While it would make it harder for people to do stuff on chain, at least it would encourage users to use the blockchain as efficiently as possible.
What do you mean by trying to redesign the highway like that exactly?
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:51:11
Would it be possible to link the two chains somehow though? Like make a transaction with an id in it that references something in ethereum?
edit: Andreas Antonopoulos talks about it here near the end:
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:54:40
I was thinking maybe ethereum would work as a side chain for storing data, maybe working with pegs

As a means of scaring people to stay away from scam ICOs etc I guess it is a good thing, honestly I think most people aren't ready for crypto after spending time with my regular-tech-ignorant family members this christmas. Although I think it would be better to educate people properly and rather warn about the real dangers, and the real potential. But doing this is way easier, this being that polish propaganda

I just read on their website and it says it's Max cap is 100 billion, and every transaction there is some fee paid, but rather than paying to miners, the tokens are actually destroyed. That's interesting when it comes to scarcity, but since the whole system is wholly controlled by the company I don't see how that couldn't be changed in the future 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:10:13
Can you please remind me of the last attack? I was trying to think of it, but I wasn't really paying that much attention before and merely saw traffic on the sub like on this one now but didn't give it much thought at the time.

@_date: 2017-12-24 12:45:19
I think it's all "premined" allthough you don't really mine. And it's more centralized and doesn't have an incentive to run a full node - which I think is a bit of a whole in the system. But some big tech companies who want to use it for internet of things things are apparently partnering with them to use it for machine to machine nano-transactions. Interestingly, Layer 2 might also enable this.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:32:02
It's bank backed so they have that going for them, which is nice. But it's not really crypto in the way we are used to. It's more like a new fiat currency, and there already exist other fiat currencies that have higher market caps than Bitcoin. IMO euro and usd should be on coinmarketcap too if ripple is there, and I think it would be a good thing for bitcoin long term. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:35:15
A wallet app that let's you manage several wallets, and make them look like regular bank accounts that you can easily transfer funds between. The app should also be LN enabled, so for example one of the said accounts is one that is LN bound, and used for small day to day transactions. 
The app could also hold other currencies, and be able to perform atomic swaps, and even have some kind of underlying automated exchange api it connects to, letting the user simply trade. 
Also, I thought it would be a good idea to make some sort of plugin platform on bitcoin core qt that developers could build upon, and  users could install selectively, but it might be a gold mine for scam plugins down the line

If I want to close the channel, what will determine the fee for that? Is it possible I wouldn't have enough to pay for the closing of the channel after I've spent all my channel bitcoin? Could this also be a way to commit an old lightning channel state for a malicious user to get his money back?

As far as I know gold is still kind of scarce in space because the fusion energy needed to create it is something that doesn't happen very often, so with increased space scale human populations it would probably still be expensive. But I don't know, I just read that thing about gold fusion briefly so I can't really back it up for sure.
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:17:50
Perhaps I'm not that good at formulating my thoughts, but basically - what is the reason why the value seems to be going down? What I was trying to say was that perhaps there are many people out there like myself who are sitting on their Bitcoin, hoping that they will go up in value, and therefore Bitcoin is failing - because nobody is spending it.
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:49:02
Ok thanks a lot. From what you're saying I guess I might be wrong about people not spending it increasingly. If you don't mind me asking, what do you think is the reason for the steady decline in value though?
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:12:48
I think you misunderstand. The point is that in theory it would go up because of deflation, but in practice it's going down because everybody is waiting for it to go up, creating sort of a spiral.
@_date: 2014-11-03 14:06:45
I agree, and I think one problem is that you still really can't use Bitcoin for anything except mostly for internet services. At least for me where I'm at (Norway). I couldn't for example spend the Bitcoin I got paid with if I was an internet merchant to buy groceries and pay rent. To do that I would have to exchange my Bitcoin for my local currency using a Bitcoin trader, where I probably would lose more than would be saved in transfer fees. And now the biggest (and pretty much only) local Bitcoin trader where I could buy and sell Bitcoin (Justcoin) directly using my local currency is closing down.

@_date: 2018-03-17 11:58:52
I think you're right, but you won't have to worry. Bitcoin will indeed evolve to become sentient, and will eventually be the saviour which has been fortold as the second coming of Christ in some mystical religions, and as something else in others - although as humanity has misunderstood historical events during primitive civilizations, its form will not be anything that we could have imagined.
