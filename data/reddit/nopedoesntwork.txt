No, it's looking good =&gt; 1st August
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:38:35
Could be. No one knows if the big whales are planning to cash out one day.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:33:19
Did someone mention their source?
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:09:31
Wasn't aware of the bearwhale incident, scary stuff. I'd imagine an incident like that will be far more devastating today, now that the price has gone up 10 fold.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:59:41
And SegWit enables off-chain transactions, which would make larger block sizes unnecessary, right?
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:06:05
Since it would be the second incident after mt.gox, I think it would destroy confidence so severely, that the price will be very low for many years to come. Your capital will be locked in and won't generate any profit for years. That's why bitcoin should be seen as gambling, not investing.

I've been contemplating this too, but I don't worry about current miners, the big whales are those that where there at the dawn of Bitcoin. Those have wallets with a few 10000 coins. If one of them decides to cash out, Bitcoin could crash so hard it might never recover.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:23:37
Afaik, they just added a [vote]( for their miner collective. We don't know how it will turn out.
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:21:34
I see, that's a good point.
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:21:55
Exactly my thinking too
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:58:19
With no users miners will go bankrupt, so the assumption is that they will quickly jump ship. That's the point of the UASF - empowering the users.

Your source is a domain registered two months ago.
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:33:57
It's a UASF (user activated soft fork), so miner percentage is much less important as nodes (users &amp; miners, user &gt;&gt; miners).
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:40:15
My magic 8 ball says: Wait till end of July - Bitcoin will crash to 1300€  before the start of UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:53:10
Most popular wallets have announced their support for UASF. Some have just recently implemented it, while others still have to. It's still two months till it matters.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:17:40
Don't panic. The BIP148 option hasn't even been added to core and we still have two months to go. People only really just started talking about UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:17:54
Atm we are already at 10% UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:06:42
Ok. Not sure how you arrived at 0.5% though (the Slush pool mentioned in your link has 4.4% of the total according to [blockchain.info]( However, looking at their site, they just enabled UASF but are waiting for users to [vote]( which indicates that we are still early in the game.
Regarding the 51% attack: Percent is percent, no matter the total. Seems unlikely that we'll have so few miners that they would be able to collaborate an attack.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:26:35
As I see it, that's just a few percent and might be normal fluctuations. It is still two months till UASF.

So if most wallets / exchanges run BIP148 after 1st August, miners will quickly follow suit.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:29:29
Can you guys please stop posting walls of nonsense? The downloads on bitcoin.org are exactly the same as on the bitcoin core github repository.
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:24:07
Oops, you're right. Seems they are still working on it: 
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:27:55
Looking at the charts on [uasfguide.com]( it's 10%.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:55:52
No, afaik UASF *will* enforce SegWit, no matter what.
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:02:06
It has been merged already: 
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:31:36
And what is your source? We are still 2 months away from UASF.
