That's the thing though. They'll find a work around. If you think they won't/can't you underestimate US govt. They would have a workforce searching for any form of exploit in cryptocurrency. The US will aggressive beat down any currency that devalues their own - especially one with no political backing behind it.

Easy to avoid taxes when you don't make any money. Le basement warrior.

Maybe not now. But if you honestly think the fed will not develop systems to catch tax evasion through bit coin you are naive.

You sound euphoric. 
The US govt have complete control over the infrastructure needed to use bitcoin. If everyone started using bitcoin instead of USD for whatever reason they could cripple it with ease. 
Quantum computing will trivialize currently impossible prime calculation so there is that as well.
You may be right in saying it is secure for now. We'll wait and see for the future. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

You underestimate what lengths they would go to if their currency base was being devalued. I can assure you right now somewhere in the fed they have a huge workforce looking for any sort of exploit or loophole in bitcoin. You are naive if you don't think the fed and GMS have a huge vested interest in cryptocurrency and that they are not going to take measures to protect their income source.

They control internet traffic in almost all the world. If its costing them enough they will find a solution. Do not think you are better than the US govt. They can afford to pay the best people to work for them.
