IRS does this for PayPal. If you have over a certain amount in those accounts (usually 20k) PayPal will report it to the IRS. 
Didn't know it was legally enforceable.

Pyramid schemes say you can get lots of money
Bitcoin (through its proponents) say you can get lots of money
Therefore Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme
^^ this is a common logical fallacy that is wrong the same way this is wrong:
A giraffe is tall.
Michael Jordan is tall.
So Michael Jordan is a giraffe. 
See how ridiculous that sounds? I'd ask your friend explain what exactly makes something a pyramid scheme, and then apply how Bitcoin fits those elements. If they're unwilling to do that, don't worry snot what they think because there isn't much thinking going on at all with their argument.
