@_date: 2017-12-22 09:53:16
It’s a long game you are playing. What is happening now is emotional. Bitcoin is tech that can’t keep up with demand just yet. Invest money you are willing to lose, relax, live life, don’t obsess over it. Unless you are an active trader, just buy, store, and “forget” we are talking years
Even if it drops 90% it’s still higher than the beginning of the year

or, you chose a shitload of bad ones, and a couple good ones
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:50:23
It's just a number, a satoshi, currently the smallest fraction of a bitcoin is 1 100th of a bitcoin, 1 cent is worth far more than that. If even more tiny numbers are needed we can just divide even more. The point is a limited total supply, but the number does not really matter.
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:20:03
Yes it is
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:07:04
I really don't think there is some kind of visual pattern at play here, it's simply a generated word list, nothing to do with connecting lines etc. All these numbers and formula thingies is just data grabbed from the whitelist. Something else is at play here.  I want to know what that notdef glyph is there for, it's very suspicious.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:37:30
this whole  "follow the whitepaper" is such a load of garbage, did you even read it?

@_date: 2018-05-28 09:57:25
What are you on about, did I ever say I believed any of that anywhere in my replies?   
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:30:39
Yeh it actually is summation icon, again used in the whitelist. So only that nodef remains. Hate that we don’t even know what we are looking for. We are just assuming a bip code. But have no idea how many words even 
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:29:44
but what does it meeeaaan?
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:27:13
Ah yes I missed Internet.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:18:58
It's just a matter of the definition, don't really see how that would be weird. We would automatically start using the definition that makes the most sense to our future selves. 
We use 1 dollar, which is just a word, with a definition of value.
Maybe people will still use 1 dollar because nationalists etc, but behind the scenes 1 dollar will be given a value defined by a fraction of a bitcoin.
Either way, bitcoin first has to still 100x before this even becomes an issue/thing

Same here, I actually had money and a ton of btc way back when, mining wildly, lost it all after formatting my HDD, then forgot about it. Then it hit 1k, I was like oh right, yes this thing will go big one day, wish I had the money to invest, I did a little, but nothing much.
It's still early days though, this thing will likely grow far far bigger, just you know, could have been on a beach doing shit all by now.

This, fiat system is not sustainable.
People say Bitcoin is fake money etc.
The real fake money is fiat, most of it is air, and if they run out, they just make more etc.
Anyways, it will be a while before bitcoin, or any other crypto will dominate.
But they will, eventually, it's completely inevitable. The question is will they do so before I die.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:30:49

@_date: 2017-11-12 02:38:46
Bitcoin is basically a very long ledger that everybody can read and edit. The system works in such a way that you are forced to always use the same ledger, so nobody can cheat.   
Currently, bitcoin is seen as a currency primarily, but it is far more than just that.
It's a kind of global agreement, which could mean really anything, projects like Ethereum have build on top of this agreement to add the ability to lock and unlock doors for example, or signing contracts. 
All these "handshakes" are stored in the same gigantic ledger of agreements, which is referred to as the blockchain, a chain of blocks, where the blocks are lists of agreements.
Miners are the system that makes sure the agreements are written down and checked etc, in return for this effort, they are rewarded with more bitcoin, but supply is limited, eventually, all bitcoins will have been released to the world.
The question if Bitcoin is a good investment is questioning if you believe a system like this is useful and remain useful.
Many like myself have strong faith in it, I personally see the "will it happen" as inevitable, the only question remaining is "when will it happen", to which the answer likely is slow at first, very bumpy, but eventually faster and faster.
It is basically digital gold, there is only so much of it, and it can keep track of itself, who owns/has-control-of what part. It is impossible to steal, unless someone has access to your key, so you have to make sure to secure it, keeping this key on a hardware wallet, disconnected from any hackable computer etc is advisable for large amounts, I suggest you do some research.  
If you plan on storing coins on an exchange for example, you are storing coins on their wallets, many of which are often connected to a network, making them hackable, most of them have very advanced security, but a thread remains, obviously people will want to access these massive piles of bitcoin. 
That said a hardware wallet can get lost in a fire, so make backups of your key.
All in all, the network will be very very hard to destroy, it would mean that every single computer that has a copy of said ledger would have to break, all at the same time, or the internet would have to get destroyed, and never get replaced by another form of communication. Already there are satellites in the sky which allows communication with the network without any internet access. Anyways, enough ranting, I'm off to bed

What they are saying is that block size increase is not the solution, they are working on layer 2 solutions, and that these solutions would likely work on most block chains, also bcash, but bcash is corrupted by the block size increases

The "make money with bitcoin" idea is only valid because it's early days in the middle of adoption. It won't be valid once people actively use it everywhere, then it will just become money, right now it's mostly still tech and investment.
To really be for bitcoin is not to invest to make money, it's to invest to help it grow and spread. Thing is, bitcoin is setup just so that greedy people wanting to make money are actually helping it grow/spread automatically.
The greed is also what is making it so volatile ofc, but if you look in between the trees you will see that slowly but surely bitcoin/crypto is spreading, growing like a fungus finding it's place in narrow cracks.
It really is very similar to the internet in that respect.
I have always said, bitcoin/crypto will succeed, either in it's current state or a variation, it's basically inevitable, the only real question I have is when, will it be before I die, I am pretty confident that it will happen, but who knows.

First of all they can't, you can't just buy a protocol, that is like buying the internet, or buying speaking, or buying driving/walking. There are ways to slow it down, or try and ban it etc. But it will be a hard-fought battle, and virtually impossible. (The only real way to kill bitcoin is by killing the internet, very unlikely to happen, it would be like destroying all the roads in the attempt to kill driving, and even that is unlikely to stop it, as of right now there are satellites above your head that allow you to use the bitcoin network even without 'the internet' for example)  
Second, the way bitcoin is set up is that the coins trickle in slowly, the idea is to make them spread around, so not one central actor can own the majority and thus, take control etc.  
Meaning that right now all bitcoins in existence are spread out all over the world, the only way to spawn these new coins is by mining, the more people/systems mine, the harder the system will make it to generate the coins, so you can't just put up a giant farm and make all the coins either, (quantum computers etc). 
This generation of coins also will eventually end once the cap is reached, 1 or 2 maybe 3 generations from now years from now I believe, not a solid date.
So, all the coins in existence are now owned by many actors all over the world, those of us who have participated in the network(mined) and got rewarded with coins, or those of us who have bought coins, directly or indirectly, from said miners. The only way a bank could "just buy all bitcoins", would be to buy them from all those actors, not an easy task, virtually impossible.
Also if they somehow magically manage that, many of the previous bitcoin owners will just set up another chain and go again, having gained a ton of fiat, guess what would happen.
In other words, it just makes no sense for banks to do that.

Nothing is free, freedom is a concept only really useful in the context of communication.
And no, it is extremely hard and unlikely the UN has control over bitcoin or any other crypto. If they want to kill crypto, they have to kill internet. Now that the concept exists though, even if they manage to kill the current version of the internet, new networks will rise quickly (already satellites are currently active so you can access bitcoin even without regular internet)   
It would be like telling people that learned to speak to stop talking english, anyways, I just want more coins. That is all

She is not wrong
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:46:38
All I want is more bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:44:23
Bubbly like carbonized water, aka volatile or rollercoaster, but not a bubble
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:15:55
point was that you can kill the language, but it will be very hard to stop people from talking or finding a way to communicate in another, and as more and more people are born this will become harder and harder
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:35:15
ha, 5650 now suckaaa

Funny, bitcoin seems to follow the Dow to a T
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:03:47
Really high, or really low, or somewhere in between
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:03:54
It may or may not, obviously Hodlers believe in bitcoin and that it will rise again, as it has done every single time so far. But more than that they believe in the tech want to support it.
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:34:23
I have 1 MILLION bitcoins! 
no, no...  
I have 1 BILLION bitcoins!
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:13:59
Well, I don't have any more money to invest right now so it's going to rocket
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:04:41
I guess it works better than saying it's a typo :)
I have lived long enough for a typo to turn into an acronym, this is language evolving right before our very eyes.

do use bitcoin, do trade fiat to bitcoin, don't trade bitcoin for fiat
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:15:04
Last dollars?  Did you even read the post?
He simply says instead of wasting money on random stuff that is not needed instead he invests it in BTC. 
PS, gambling is pure risk, bitcoin is investment, very different

Oh for sure, bitcoin is bubbly as hell, big masses jump on board and then get hurt, it comes in waves. It being connected to the internet and it's lightning fast roads/communication simply has that effect on humans. If you look at trends around the internet you see that everywhere. 
Memes are a great example, they explode going viral, then slowly die out, but meanwhile meme's have found a solid footing and are now part of the way we talk. Similar thing with emoticons, once a fad, now a way of life.
I think with bitcoin, because we are talking money, which is basically synonymous with life/happiness for many people, volatility will be extra, say, emotional. But as long as there is an upward trend, no matter how minute, Bitcoin is on the right track of becoming a household tool.
Once it reached that point where it's in the 'cracks' so to say, you should see things coming together very quickly, and before you know it bitcoin will be everywhere.
So far everything is pointing to success, the waves are growing ever bigger.

last year was 2011?
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:41:36
will drop lower
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:21:17
Bubbly yes, bubble no.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:18:42
simply hype making it grow faster than it should, but grow it will
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:11:31
you will lose money, and then later get more
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:54:56
I think you mean 'here'   
And what is your point? Are you telling me this diagram is the essence of Bitcoin now? My god man, get your head together.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:12:43
The DOW is crashing, bitcoin is crashing, I have no beer,  HAAAAALP!!!!!
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:47:48
What kind of weird logic is that? I think the diagram is dumb, the diagram is not Bitcoin, it’s a diagram. Adding to that, if you think this diagram is worth anything, you do not understand Bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:23:14
That's it, bitcoin is doomed to fail
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:21:08
But, then I would just tell you to buy more
@_date: 2018-07-15 10:39:40
By the time millennials are old and supposed to benefit from their pensions the system will have collapsed and will all be in deep shit.
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:08:53
They are both pension funds, though yes, they work a little different that is true, however, both will fail when the markets collapse again.
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:49:39
The difference is either a DB or a DC fund.
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:32:58
a 401k is literally a pension fund.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:13:05
Strange, it has made me very rich
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:30:20
They are both pension funds, but what people call a pension fund usually refers to a different system like the one you describe. 401k is a pension fund, but we call it a 401k because calling both of them pension fund leads to confusion as you see here.  
Maybe calling them both retirement funds instead will calm you down?  
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:23:04
Do you? Try it
@_date: 2018-07-29 10:37:03
A stupid and broken diagram
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:40:44
Also there is a VERY serious financial collapse on the horizon
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:19:31
Probably everywhere, like remember that thing that happened not too long ago, but with real potential for the dam breaking this time around.
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:26:12
This guy is completely insane
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:02:11
This, yes, Bitcoin will very likely rise if you like me believe in the product.Right now, there is no real reason for it to skyrocket so quickly though, nice to see, but this is mostly just FOMO and will only crash again at some point.
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:14:56
yes, donkeys + 5 = Lambo
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:15:10
So, what you are saying is the only use for fiat is for use as an insufflation tube?
