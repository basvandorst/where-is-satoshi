Yes, if you’re smart about it.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:11:12
I do both, and will continue to do so. There are key times when either action has much potential~
@_date: 2018-09-04 23:03:52
Nice, hopefully something does happen. I’m sure they’re many more sites just like this! Just wish more people were more cautious and skeptical about that stuff.
Perhaps I can try that out. Seems he’s more interested in”buying” my BTC which makes me think he has none himself. Probably has no money to buy mine either. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 07:08:14
Oh shit! Looking at it like that~ could easily but one of each for the whole family!? Not that I need or what to...
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:56:35
Great! Another looser scammer wasting his time with me then. I have no regrets with pulling these assholes along for a few days/weeks. But what I really need to learn is how to flip the scam on them...
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:07:44
Thanks for the info. Yes, staying far away. Got 2 scammers from there a few days apart 2 weeks ago...
@_date: 2018-09-02 07:46:17
Sad thing is that someone will lose their money with this asshole...

Also haven’t had any trouble with lbc but have heard quite a few horror stories. Not sure that they will ever stop. It’s the same game anywhere with almost anything. Just too bad that things have to come down to lawyers when this kind of money is involved...

Japan represents!
@_date: 2018-08-24 07:03:57
Ah, poor Bcash...
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:15:21
Hmm... leave it up to a BCASHer to not address the simply stated facts. So children under the age of (X) have no valid points due to that fact? Time for some re-evaluation I think.  
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:04:48
Wonder how expensive those will be?

Blockchain iPhone app
@_date: 2018-10-02 04:47:39
This all the way. Bitcoin&gt;PayPal
@_date: 2018-10-02 04:21:24
Never heard of BTC-A trade. Looks and sounds like a scam. A bottomless pit to through away your bitcoin... I’m happy to be proven wrong and will more than happily take it back. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 04:29:55
@_date: 2018-06-21 05:47:59
Ouch! Gotta feel sorry for those that lost everything they had there...
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:31:59
Oh! They might finally have found my weakness. Getting payed to play their shitty games~ should give it a try I guess!
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:50:20
Unless it’s to me, I’ll gladly buy your bitcoins!
@_date: 2019-04-28 09:14:57
Paxful is the safest place to do it but the rates all depend on the seller you use...
@_date: 2019-04-29 05:49:59
It truly is a shame that so many coins are 100% lost in recoverable... if only there were a way to get them back into circulation.
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:04:27
Get all the forks you can! That’s money you can spend freely on anything you like.  Wow, I can’t imagine how happy you must be right now! Enjoy it!!
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:39:03
Got it! Thanks for verifying my suspension. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 00:10:25
Wow, that’s tough! I’d hate to be attacked like that. Too bad bitmain probably not going to do anything about it either they way their hurting now...
@_date: 2019-01-19 08:20:38
I’m very interested. But a phone number only? No email address? No SNS presence?
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:56:45
Not sure how you jump to that but I assure you there are no manhole issues. Nothing I’m afraid of. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 07:06:21
Peter, ha. So overrated...
@_date: 2019-09-20 09:53:00
Ouch! That stings! 7 BTC is so painful... I sure hope that you get it back and the interest owed.
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:45:56
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:04:49
I see there being a lot of offers. Are the prices flexible? Also how do you accept payment?
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:27:06
Estimates while satisfying aren’t the best measure by any means. As stated before in just general discussion with Japanese I rarely speak to someone with knowledge of bitcoin. Those that know about it do not own or want any. When I tell them that I use it weekly they always tell me to be careful with it and about it.
Of those that know not all are familiar with or remember mtgox. It made the news obviously but was soon forgotten... perhaps if I’ve ever got a day to kill I might do a random sample/data collection downtown to get you that estimate. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:01:07
Umma hafta get me some!
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:04:25
That it is but many average people still don’t know or are suspicious of it...
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:11:04
Having lived here for the last 15 years and speaking to them daily about such things I have personal experience on the matter. Hence what I said. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:34:54
Drove me away. Then again it was only a matter of time before they caught on to my dirty deeds using PayPal. Will never look back! Don’t need me now...
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:09:19
So how does this work?
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:06:46
Yea, there are literally dozens of shops, restaurants &amp; such in my immediate vicinity that won’t take credit cards. In the immortal words of the WuTang Clan, CREAM! Fiat is still king in Japan. Don’t let all of the bitcoin hype fool you guys. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:23:33
Here are a few places to start! Once you get the hang of it and your clients trust your work and the quality of it they'll come back for more and even spread the word. I'm always impressed at the power of recommendations~
Best of luck with your endeavors!
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:18:53
There are quite a few ways to "earn" bitcoin. I've come across a few articles here n there about it. I personally have been doing "work" for bitcoin for the past 3 years. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:19:07
Well then you misread or misunderstood my reply. I know that it’s a leader. What I said was that the average person still doesn’t know about it. I understand that not every reddit user is a native English speaker but..
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:03:57
Added my 2 cents. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:51:42
Looks like our coins aren’t safe no matter where we store them now!
