I don't see a reason why a node operator should relay 0 fee transactions and even less incentive for a miner to include it in a block. It's not logically sound. And we know that a fee maket existed even before blocks where full. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 05:51:51
If you love core and big blocks the natural choice should be BitcoinEC.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:34:53
Nothing to see here. They are signaling for BitcoinEC.

A bit anecdotal maybe, but I hade a BU node that didn't crash. Not every node did go down if you look at the chart. I think a more diversely in clients is good not only for stability of the network but also for competition. I think it's really bullish for Bitcoin and I'm looking forward to a future Bitcoin that evolves mush faster then the Bitcoin that we have today.

Jeff Garzik don't understand that a 1 or 21,000,000 Bitcoin wouldn't make any difference because a number is infinitely divisible. A 1 mb spam filter has not room for infinit transactions. Not changing the 1mb limit when needed is as stupid as not adding more decimals when we need more units in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:07:17
I don't understand the concept of miners fighting over fees if they are small as in a non full block future where subsidy is there main income? For a miner is seems like it makes all the differences in the world if it's $0.10 or $10,000,000 apiece because 12,5 by itself is just a number that don't tell anything about how much goods and services you could buy. 
And could you please answer my questions even if it doesn't matter for you thesis as i think they does.

I worry too much as well and I agree with you about the shitstorm. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 08:49:00
I think you worry to much. I don't think there is a reason to believe that miners will take future blocksize changes lightly with EC. There are stong economic incentives working against fiddling around with the limit.
Why downvotes?

So you are trying to apply farmer logic to a computer sciences project. I feel sorry for you that your team are a such a amateurish bunch of imbeciles. Look if you have no scientific proof of the full block theory then you should be ashamed. Use the tools of science and stop whining. You guys really need to step up your game and stop making excuses. From now on Bitcoin is going to be about science and competition so get used to it!
@_date: 2017-03-31 05:59:11
Bicoin isn't anyones property so the word attack is not viable. It's natural for bitcoin to become a more competitive space. Survival in the harsh bitcoin future should be reserved for the fittest.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:21:13


This is bitcoin and there will be no split if a fork happens with ~75-80% hashpower. A split is so unlikely that it shouldn't be discussed as a serious problem. Bitcoin has difficulty retarget ever  2016 block. The only split that people can relate to is Ethereum and it have a difficulty retarget every block. There has been hundreds of hardforks in other cryptos and only one good example of a split. And that split was really controversial with rewriting of the history and selling out the mutability aspect of Ethereum. Upgrading bitcoin to bigger blocks is that so controversial? Really?


This is mitigated really well thanks to Xthin and Compatct blocks(i think) and should not be regarded a big problem any more.

Lightning doesn't need Segwit
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:28:57
I did just read the headline but why did you call it attacks? Are core a victim of anything else then there own lack of fitness? It seem like the dress of victimization is not suitable if core is going to survive in the new harsh landscape competition.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:44:17
There is no need to add more bitcoins because the number is not important. Satoshi could have made it  21, 21 million or 21 billion when he created Bitcoin. There is no need to add more Bitcoins because it's not a limit because a number is infinitely divisible. Not the same holds true for the 1 mb limit. There is a huge need to fit more transactions in a block. Comparing the 21 million cap with the 1 mb limit is just an distraction.
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:17:09


No client ~~rules~~ owns the network so consensus rules can change with clients. I think that core would adopt the new rules as in BitcoinEC while continuing there path to segwith. The option is to kill the client if this would be the case and that is a valid option as well. But it would lead to less diversity but i think it's unlikely because core has a market share and a brand name that has value. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:28:39
I can be a 10 day redditor and be right? It's not mutually exclusive, kind of reminds me of EC and Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:51:59
Ok sorry to hear that. I really thought that would be the best option to get segwit implemented.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:39:30
No they are signaling for BitcoinEC I'm sure.

@_date: 2017-03-31 08:18:18
Bigger blocks could very well be EC as a malleability fix very well could be segwit. Sure there are othere options that haven't gained much popular support yet. The objection against bitcoin infinity blocks is that it has a greater risk of leading to centralization I think. Personally I think that the risks are exaggerated both regarding EC and infinity.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:11:09
We don't need to raise the cap because we have evidence that block reward is enough to fuel the network in at least 123 years. Do you really believe that we are going to raise the 21 million cap? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:54:35
 It seem totally contradictory to fee statistics that we have from the past and it contradicts peter r finding that fees will exist without full blocks. I find it a little bit hard to believe that fees are going to go to 0 and that full blocks are the solution to the problem. But I will look into it so thanks! 
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:50:44
So no scientific research then? You mean you make a big claim like that without any backing? Seriously!!!!!! We have scientifically peer reviewed study to back up our claim and we got statistics and you come empty handed. Shame on you!
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:51:24
I just trying to make seems of how the system is getting unstable and how fees falls to 0. Seems to me that the price of a Bitcoin has a lot to do with the inflation. When block rewards is halved there has been a equilibrium adjustment in the market value of Bitcoin way before the event every time. I mean I understand that we eventually will have sub Satoshi fees but that would be a great success because that would indicate that Bitcoin would have a tremendous market value. I have not have time to read the paper yet but hopefully it will make it clear.
@_date: 2017-03-20 05:57:25
It's a start. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:21:45
Roger say what? He has nothing against LN what i have heard? Bigger blocks and LN is not mutually exclusive.   
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:40:00


Do you have any scientific study that backs this up? Because we know really well (a posteriori) that Bitcoin has been secure, *low fee* , censorship resisted and a store of value by looking at the statistical data when blocks weren't full. And we know (a priori) thanks to Peter Rizuns research that Bitcoin is going to stay secure, *low fee*, censorship resistant and a store of value in the non full block future. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:18:57
Ok I have started to read your paper but I'm having problems to grasp some aspects of it. I can understand that from the perspective of an bypasser it would look like the block subsidy is going down towards 0. I mean it's obvious right, 50, 25, 12,5 and so on until 123 years down the road possibly? And then someone comes along and make the obvious case - we need much more fees to make up for the loss in subsidy. But from an economic perspective it's totally backwards. Actually it's on the brink of insanity. The value of the rewards is actually increasing over time in tandem with the network effect. I mean from the 50 btc reward Satoshi got back in the days he could have bought a small fraction of a pizza. If Satoshi mined a block today and got, by the looks of it, a much smaller 12,5 btc reward he could probably eat pizza to the point he exploded. It turns out that the goods and services that you can get in return from a block reward today is way more then it was in Satoshis days. And from a economic perspective that would mean, contrary to the bypasser would assume, that you will get more mining subsidy over time. And without an artificial block limit we could also expect fees to decrease over time because one Satoshi could be much more valuable then it is today for the same reason.
In some way the full block theory is working against the network effect because it limits the use cases of Bitcoin severely and that would give Bitcoin a lower value proposition. And a Bitcoin with a lower value in terms of goods and services it could buy would actually mean less mining rewards for miners. 
One thing that I can understand is that there is unlimited demand for on-chain transactions but somehow I think the market is more then capable of handling what goes into the Blockchain based on miners and nodes operators working together on minimum fees then an ad hoc limit of some sort. Could you agree on this?
Do you recognize that the block subsidys are actually increasing over time in terms of the goods and services they can buy? And if they are increasing; is there a reason and a need for transaction fees to rise and replace mining subsidy?
@_date: 2017-03-31 05:39:58
How is consensus by poll based on uneducated opinions important? The biggest forums on the topic of bitcoin are not leveled playing fields. Voices are silenced and company names are dragged through the dirt if "wrong" opinion is expressed. 
And segwit and changing the ad hoc limit is not mutally exclusive so there is no need for a user to pick a side.
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:02:07
Segwit ain't the only fix in town.

It's a Sybil attack because node operators are kept uneducated by reading the unleveled playing feilds of the biggest outlets for bitcoin news. There is a total lack of open discussion and that's the one entity that makes it a sybil attack. Just look at the front page of r/bitcoin. Where are the critical voices against UASF?

No most miners are not running core. Miners are the only "users" that gets to vote. If you don't like the bitcoin they are voting for, you as an non-voting user, is free to leave Bitcoin or buy your own bitcoin voting equipment...

I have paid more in transaction fees this year then my node have cost me. In my book that balance is broken. I think you have solved the wrong problem if you think ridiculously high fees are the answer to decentralization. What you should be looking for is an incentive structure for running a node.

You are spinning history here. NO UASF didn't achieve shit! Developers and miners reached a Hong Kong consensus which clearly stated that segwit and a 2MB hardfork will both be deployed before the retarded creation of UASF. Segwit2x is the same agreement done right -- without core!

From the whitepaper:
The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.
They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.
You are welcome!

Segwit2x is the New York agreement again. Done right this time - without core. UASF will be remembered as a joke. It has nothing to do with segwit2x or the first agreement core failed to deliver on.
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:16:34
Yes. Absolutely. My only hope is that my node will help others do transaction and that my contribution adds value to bitcoin(it's a mutual gain). 
Who asked for the ridiculous fees? Miners that earn more money then ever in terms of what the block reward can by them in goods and services, node operators that has to pay ridicoulus fees + cost of node, users who can't do transactions because most of addresses holds less bitcoin then would pay for the transaction fee? WHO? And where is the white paper that explains the 1 mb fee market??
