Western Union is *not* in the market of transferring huge amounts of money. It's in the market of sending relatively small amounts for personal reasons. Still not in the everyday purchase category, but rarely going above the security deposit/rent range. 
Also, Western Union charges no fees for online bank transfers, for the transfers that *do* have fees, most of them are in the $3-8 dollar range, which is less than the cost of bitcoin fees. Beyond that, when you send or receive a WU transfer you are transferring *spendable* currency that can immediately be used to purchase goods and services without having to pay additional conversion fees. 
Bitcoin does separate itself in that you are unable to send huge amounts of currency with WU (in the 5k+ usd range) but you are with bitcoin. The question is, does that difference in operation justify a market cap of nearly $300 billion?

In the very early days it was apparent that was true. When Bitcoin was like $1,000 per coin I would still always prefer to send Doge instead and pay a fee of 1 Doge. The idea of many websites (which are the most prevalent use of btc right now) charging a default of .0005 as a fee is insane. In what universe is paying nearly $10 to transfer money reasonable? It goes against the entire idea of adoption that sold bitcoin as a currency alternative in the first place. It only makes sense for huge transfers, which are only good for money transfer, not purchases.
