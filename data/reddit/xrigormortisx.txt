I don't believe that rich-seeking was the driving motive behind the creation of bitcoin. Fiat is easy enough to use to control the masses and is the comfortable system. Greedy people and 'rich-seekers' give themselves way more credit than is do, and like to pat themselves on the back as if they did any hard work at all, while giving zero fucks about who could have created this technology and what would their motive be?

You are correct, kind of makes me uncertain about what the future holds... it's probably best to try and live in the moment as much as possible.

Really? I would totally use that, I just switched back over to Mozilla broswer because I never realized it was open source. To me, having any remnants of corporate fingerprints on my stuff is like an insidious cancer just slowly building up in the back ground.

And some nerds will do dirty work that ONLY they could do, just for a larger paycheck...

All of which, the larger consumer base has not only allowed, but encouraged to encroach upon what was intended to be a free space. This is what happens when all power and authority is handed over to corporations who seek to enslave us all. We can't have freedom as a larger group, because not enough people truly value freedom, and instead just give it up freely.

That's true, the massive efforts to increase freedom seem to be largely negated by those who make it their absolute life purpose to dominate others and spread further chaos.

I think does have a bit of a point since this is Bitcoin we are talking about. Remember that Bitcoin is not a stock, and should not be thought of, or treated in the same way as a stock. It's ultimate goal is to entirely replace fiat currencies around the world. I really don't like the thought of federal regulators getting involved because I think they will try to manipulate things to their exclusive advantage, exactly the opposite of what Satoshi Nakamoto would have wanted.
