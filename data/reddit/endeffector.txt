@_date: 2017-12-19 13:21:57
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:54:13
its a pyramid scheme man you can always enter.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:36:57
they don't let people sell?
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:04:54
everybody here has regrets on some trade thats normal.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:37:08
exchanges already have all the data.
at least in Kraken you have to give your name, address, my account number, picture of id citizen card...
there is not escaping.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:13:34
I use kraken, site is laggy and you need to refresh a lot but works fine with sepa  transfers.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:08:05
You should use kraken!
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:09:05
Just let them talk, bitcoin is a currency buying is okay and selling is also okay
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:30:03
I really want Bitcoin to fall like 20%, I miss the rollercoaster memme.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:44:40
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:36:17


who the fuck drives with that kind of money?
Just do a transfer from bank to bank with your cellphone, wtf its 2017.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:57:34
in crypto 5 months is like 5 years(50years?)
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:34:09


what does this even mean?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:30:16
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:40:17
Its called the CASHENING!
bCash going up 10%! while Bitcoin goes down.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:22:09
I do not like BCash.
I'm just joking with you.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:10:23
I use kraken, it lags and crashes but it works.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:06:03
Do not tell them.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:17:49
LUL yeah, so funny.
He forgot to zoom out.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:31:00
If we all sell we can buy it cheaper at the bottom!
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:38:13


takes a few days, because it takes Kraken time and then the SEPA normal time(Working days only).
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:20:43
in Kraken is holding at Vegeta line.
Vegeta too strong.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:26:38


why are you stressed out bro?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:00:07
no, people are hedging.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:49:54
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:31:05
Takes your bank 1-2 days to do the SEPA plus some time for kraken to credit the money to your account. So its fine.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:12:51
400€ drop wow
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:00:59
why are you reading a thread from 5 months ago?
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:26:17
In kraken when you do a sell order it shows how much you will get.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:46:23
Same thing in Kraken. 
Can't access, they are trying to avoid a BTC crash
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:44:11
He shorted.
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:23:45
Rip the banks
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:49:10
Some like lambos
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:09:42
Kraken stop loss was deactivated last year.
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:29:08
lol Missed that  email then.
@_date: 2018-08-21 10:39:23
Trading bolivars/lira for btx might be a good decision.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:58:08
humm I think I'm going to watch Game of Thrones instead lol.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:18:29


are you confused?
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:03:37
moon? ahah no.
its sell time now.
you buy low sell high. (Its high -&gt; so sell.)
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:58:20
I'm testing Kraken site this week.


I'm only using 50€....
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:19:22
tired why? I love him.
fluctuations is what gives us the moneys.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:51:44
you buy low and you sell high.
It was high so I sold.
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:06:45
is it connected to the moon phases too?
this needs to be researched.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:33:50
Buy it in Kraken.
You don't have to buy 1 bitcoin you can buy less like 0.001bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:33:33


in their email it said almost no users used them.
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:28:22
day trading is hard work.
and in the crypto world is 24/7 trading not only "day". 
Trading never stops.
I hated getting up at night to buy/sell, I stopped doing that.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:51:51
estuda sobre [MADC]( [RSI]( e [moving averages simple and exponential](
são indicadores que te podem ser muito uteis.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:31:09
I'm here just for the moon pictures.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:55:03
Ripple was up yesterday evening before the BTC drop.
It was very nice.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:55:49
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:08:44
Kraken is so nice. I'm enjoying the service.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:59:44
No, its a new security step.
"For certain cryptocurrency withdrawals, we use a security feature that requires you to click a link in an email we sent you to release your withdrawal hold. If the link isn't clicked for 1 hour, the withdrawal will be canceled. "
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:08:46
People sold bitcoin cash and bought bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:51:39
I'm waiting for the price correction too lol
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:48:15
Kraken is what I use.
You can buy btc and other cryptos.
I use SEPA bank transfers.
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:35:10
You need to be looking at the prices for opportunities of sell/buy.
Constantly searching news.
For example saturday afternoon, at 21:00 GMT in Kraken bitcoin got a big sale went from 3660€ -&gt; 3268€ -&gt; back to 3664€. If you day trade you need to react instantly to events like this.
I saw this I was like WTF!
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:49:42
litecoin didn't moon.
there was only a crazy pump last night.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:11:21
you can buy bitcoin on Kraken without proof of residence, BUT you get limited to 2k € a day and 10k € a month.
I use SEPA transfers instead of credit card, don't know about credit card.
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:44:16


Stop looking at the price.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:04:50




fake, you should be banned.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:57:29
MACD shows it going down still, and in the RSI its still not oversold.
Its going down.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:21:42
thx facking god!
(I bought high... lol)
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:16:51
not enough indications that it will go up.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:59:05
no mistake man. thats the big drop.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:04:58
slowly going up, its fine.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:08:16
I'm using Kraken, did a SEPA transfer and in some hours got the deposit and bought.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:32:40
don't worry tomorrow its friday aka "Dip Day"
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:57:15
I prefer my strategy.
I will buy when it finishes drooping.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:43:09
I never tried to withdraw yet.
Its the part of the service I haven't tested yet.
I'm interested too. Depositing took 12h.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:55:12
Don't agree. 
Bitcoin and other cryptos aren't "soaring".
momentum dropped around 5am gmt in bitcoin.
same momentum slow down is visible in etherum around 7am gmt it started dropping a little.
crypto and fiat markets aren't that disconnected.
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:38:02
if you made profit you need to pay taxes.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:53:47
fees are like 0.10€ in Kraken.
the more orders you do the least you pay in fees, the first ones were higher (like 0.24€)
I bought BTC yesterday
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:03:39
money that you don't use is really useful.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:58:38
my bank fees are 1€ per SEPA transaction....
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:00:14
good day to sell.
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:30:03
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:31:50
humm cryptowatch?
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:29:05
I use Kraken, I just keep stuff there I don't care about wallets.
you bought at all time high so just don't look at it during the next 2-3 weaks.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:25:54
btc is going UP strong now.
Also Ripple WTF is going on?
edit: okay about Ripple, they have an event where they are going to show something they are doing in Korea. (rumors!)
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:48:35
ohh I already sold.
I'm just watching now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:53:28
BOOM, BOYS THat RED STICK!
dropping starts
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:45:10
But you can buy other cryptos with euros on kraken you dont need to have btc.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:39:36
ya, compraste muito alto isso, vais sofrer agora com o preço a subir e descer. Mas pronto tem calma e como disse n olhes para isso muito.
se comprares mais vê o Bitcoin Cash que caiu bastante esta semana e está agora a subir. [Com este podes vir a ter mais ganhos.](
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:49:57
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:14:39
everybody else is.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:50:05
why would Bitfinex get shutdown?
(sorry too much work this week....)
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:40:44
oh yes there was some hack thing
But what is the connection to the exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:58:39
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:55:53
2.6% wot?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:34:19
not a Lambo omg...
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:16:19
Pump is here!!! 22%!
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:55:02
This needs to happen. This level of debt os just ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:46:24
not buying at all
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:56:12
why is this happening?
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:55:27


wait for the weekend.
Saturday afternoon.
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:33:28


well no.
its crashing today.
just let it fall a bit more.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:21:58
All Time High
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:03:38
I asked for the opinion of the prophets not yours
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:29:59
needs to fall more, not good enough to buy. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:10:08
in an exchange.
I do it in Kraken, you also can try in localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:30:10
yes I did that and obviously she said that she couldn't see my picture on my ID card.
Like You don't need tier 3 anyways.
tier 2 is just fine.
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:43:11
each trades costs like 0.1€ so you don't want to be always doing trades.
buy when it crashes, when people oversell.
yesterday was a good day to buy for example.
be patient.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:16:37
I'm waiting too.
but I'm fine. It's fine.
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:28:38
I can do everything with tier 2
I'm not American.
I'm limited to 2k € a day and 20k € a month.


@_date: 2017-09-01 13:51:03
ahaha I have btc in Euros too.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:40:16
I took created my account and took care of registrations on a saturday so no.
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:42:57


are you saying that China is going to ban bitcoin again?
@_date: 2017-09-09 11:45:53
I use kraken.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:19:50
you should wait for the next dip
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:25:38
but its okay, its fine.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:34:39


its still fine. I'm still fine.
trading 24/7 It will do down eventually
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:37:51
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:48:37
Its at ATH, wait for the Dip.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:50:31


late why?
price crashed yesterday so you aren't late.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:15:04
some exchanges in China will stop Bitcoin trading and some people sold a little.
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:33:26
but the crash was yesterday...
you bought in the wrong moment.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:04:38
thx you
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:11:17
sorry, everything I like is too green to buy.
So I'm bored.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:05:10
thx you
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:43:20
Ahahha amazing
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:23:34
Christmas was early that's what happened.
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:01:49
At least you did not buy ethereum at 330€ LUL
Ethereum suicide selling right now. 
Hilarious to watch.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:03:31
ohh man I wanted to buy a shittone of xrp and now I can't...
Same problem Kraken down.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:59:28
Ask them when the Dip is! u/srod19 and u/101111
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:43:29
the dip was yesteday.
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:15:54
Wtf is a etf?
@_date: 2018-07-27 07:48:47
The key date I got is 10 august.
@_date: 2018-07-26 07:35:37
You want to kill Maduro?
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:17:10
We are still on a bear market.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:19:20
This is science!
@_date: 2018-07-27 07:29:58
But wasn't the ETF going to be review on 10 of August?
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:29:57
Very nice, love the wheels.
I am also looking at this car.
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:52:02
Thx you
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:46:51
Thx you
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:39:39
Youre post is really confusing.
Post youre link to the bitcoin futures, I would like to see the dates.
@_date: 2018-07-26 07:58:01
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:18:25


its falling, you are buying high....
so I disagree.
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:48:23


balls of steel!
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:09:02


if it gets to 1500 and is still falling you should not buy. You have to wait for the price to start going up, wait for GREEN to buy.
If you want to buy you should buy ChainCoins they are going up 60%.
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:06:12
yes, it started to go up but I'm curious if drops by friday like it as been happening.
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:53:09
but its still falling.
if you buy when its falling you are buying high... and we all know that is wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:21:02


first it needs to stop falling.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:59:51
well you are losing money at this moment.


you should only buy when is going UP not when going DOWN.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:37:51
well 1 august is near .... (aka apocalypse)
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:16:20
rude person
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:44:08
I will wait three weaks
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:34:28
if its falling you let it fall, when it starts going up again is when you buy.
You buy low and you sell high.
If you buy now you will be buying high...
