The only value Bitcoin has is speculation, it's not going to be a real currency at any point, too many issues with the tech as is for what do you see it being used for? Mass Adoption? Businesses already dipped their toes in and ran away because of the volatility brought by speculation.
Maybe another crypto will one day, but not Bitcoin as it is.

There's still a lot of regulatory uncertainty.

I'll buy when 1 BTC = 1 dollar just for fun.

There's still plenty globally and the US still hasn't codified decent laws about it. There was just a progressive wave elected to Washington, can't really legislate just yet, but give it two years when the wave continues and you have a young, progressive agenda on the table that will be examining a whole swathe of cutting edge issues that haven't been properly examined because of the average age of Congress and just how cutting edge it is. 
I have zero doubts that cryptocurrency will be one of them. 
Just look at this 
To see just alone in the US how many different and conflicting views we have on crypto and I'm sure that's anything but exhaustive.

If my bank card doesn't work the last thing in the world I'm going to be doing is ducking about with Bitcoin. In fact if the collapse is that catastrophic I highly doubt most people will be able to maintain access to the internet.
I'd rather have access to large stores of ammunition, nonpershiable foods, and clean water in that circumstance.

The fact that this ignorance is at the top of this subreddit, tells you all you need to know about the future viability of Bitcoin.
I certainly believe in the bright future of cryptocurrency and the development of tech around and behind it, but this attitude right here is why it should scare most people away from buying into specifically Bitcoin right now. You're never going to get your libertarian dream here. If and when crypto is accepted as a currency it will be alongside government regulation and backing.

It's reflective of a lot of the hopes, dreams, and political slants of the earliest backers of bitcoin and a non-insignificant portion of its support base. It's obviously had an impact on it's value but Bitcoin still isn't closer to this worldwide accepted digital currency that is upending banks (if anything they've profited handsomely off the speculation of the currency), dodging taxes and fees (many stores that accept it that haven't dropped it have fees for taking it).
Lighting network looks promising but I still think there's some really significant structural issues with and still a lot of regulatory uncertainty.
