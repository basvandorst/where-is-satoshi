Remember when Amazon came out... they were just books. The whole "what is your amazon plan?" came out. Everyone discounted them.
Now look...
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:12:41
18 months?
@_date: 2016-04-03 16:05:14
Another side note, ask them do they like being nickel'd and dime'd in regards to fees? Banking, atm, credit card etc etc
How often do they swipe a card.. middlemen %ages off the top.
For me, bitcoin goes back to the original form of barter. I am trading something of value (determined by overall consensus) for a good or a service. I dont have to pay a broker 2-5% when I want this, I just do it. 
Also, might want to clarify how they view the word crypto - they might assume its "untraceable" when the crypto aspect refers to math.

Damage control time? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:07:26
Either way... i have my popcorn ready.
Love the ride lol WHHEEEEE
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:52:15
Damage control ... Overstock just made a huge splash. Can't stop us now!
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:07:45
Dude... in the short time you had... you kicked ass! Keep it up brother!!
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:38:14
Woo! Internet hi-5! Good stuff Andreas.
And welcome to the fold Dorian! 
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:32:06
This was an awesome video. Also... I wanna go to Canada now
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:25:57
That is going to be one HELL of a pain to maintain and tweak. Hope they got good boards
@_date: 2014-02-20 01:00:24
Now, one other stretch. Alien life... in all things math is a constant. By having a mathematically elegant formula (ie. the blockchain) available for examination. We "in a sense" prove we have intelligence to them. 
This is a crazy time, and I'm so happy to be riding this wave. Whatever happens for better or for worse, I'm having a blast.
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:01:27
First they laugh at you, then they fight you, then they join you
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:27:21
whoa if you follow the 2nd from the top tx. it leads to a wallet with 12, 836 btc in it. about 5-6 steps deep
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:05:09
Your humbleness is exemplary. However, due to your visibility in the community I do believe you have become a rockstar to us in a sense. 
As always, thanks for all you do for us.
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:22:56
I bought trezor's 2 for 3 deal! I happy! :D
@_date: 2014-11-01 00:58:16
I have used you in the past and you always did a great job. Hats off to you friend and hope you have great luck in your future endeavors!
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:22:21
That was awesome lol
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:23:12
me too! :D rawk on!
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:19:43
Wow... tracking the first transaction 10 layers deep so far and its still being shuffled/moved around.
Glad the chain is public so we can find this
Ended up here... lets see if it moves more
as of 8 minutes ago, lets see where the next block leads us
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:33:55
Thanks for the excellent work at the Canadian hearing. That was AWESOME!
Thanks for all the work you do for the community.
You can be damn sure I will be buying the book.
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:01:04
Lets give this a shot.
I love the idea.
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:21:59
User names and passwords are typically assigned to the "worker" not the actual account itself.
Gaining access is unlikely.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:13:51
This is enormously fun lol
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:15:59
Same goal here. I will get there, just a matter of time.
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:36:10
Funny thing about this is that its also primed to be used as a medium of exchange if we establish ourselves in the solar system. (Moon base, Mars base type stuff.) All we would need is a robust sat net.
But yes. Definitely a start to a Type I currency.
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:19:51
Shit yes... :D confirming live as well. Just made an account to check! 
You guys kick ass!
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:30:10
Ah... I forgot to look at the time stamp of that TX, 2 weeks ago. But if that is a hot wallet address... who's is it?
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:22:47
My thought process is that even if the BANKS ban it, the PEOPLE can still use it as a medium of exchange/barter. I.E. its not illegal to own/use Bitcoin
So while the banks are hurting it temporarily, there is nothing to be said about people using it outside the banks influence etc.
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:40:37
If its an active, functional exchange, we should see transactions on regular block intervals. Time to monitor those ones it seems. 
Man, hope someone can figure this out. 
Hah, nm... my brain ignores timestamps for some reason. That address in question with the 12k btc in it, has flow into and out of it, and some are still confirming.
@_date: 2015-05-23 16:12:58
Only 21 million bitcoins will ever be produced by the network. Restricted by the code Satoshi put in place.
@_date: 2014-11-22 04:52:50
Wooo awesome! can bring a few coins out of cold storage
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:10:49
I like using sites like gyft etc. 
Kinda neat when you're ordering a 100 dollar gift card, and the amount they charge you is less than 100 bucks in btc. And you also get 3% back, so in this manner, its a tiny bit cheaper to use btc than fiat.
With the instant buy-back option available, it makes it even easier.
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:55:24
Keep the thoughts going. All we need is a sat net for the most part. 
Lunar colony? Mars Base? 
BTC as a store of value for intra-solar system trade :D sweeeeet
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:42:32
Fully agree, however I was surprised how many more people actually followed through. Just a short time ago it was a royal pain in the ass to buy bitcoin.
Love hove fast this is moving!
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:36:07
Hah! Lydia has a brain on her for sure :D Gotta love the smart ones!
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:56:12
About the same. I used it for some trades, but then it started feeling a bit dodgy. No vetting process for coins to trade on. Things just suddenly appearing.. then cryptsy points... ugh
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:00:22
6 Minutes... clear and concise.
Fucking awesome.
@_date: 2015-11-26 16:55:19
Hahaha, thanks for all you do Erik.
Also, thanks for the reminder not to rattle peoples cages about bitcoin today :D
@_date: 2015-03-07 19:19:06
What in the world? lol Whats up with FinalHash?
@_date: 2015-11-08 18:01:54
If you are in the US, you can use Gyft to buy gift cards with it. 
Pretty handy service.
I say keep some in bitcoin, but also use some to see how it works. It's pretty awesome stuff.
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:37:39
Hahahha "we told you to stop shorting small rallies"

How can people talk of a bubble, when there has been nothing like this that has ever existed before?
Both a currency/commodity. It doesn't move with stocks and set outputs. Nor as a commodity it doesn't have set production times. Speculation is near impossible. Its worldwide, 24/7 trading market. And any government economy destabilization sends people fleeing to bitcoin. Just look at Cyprus. 
My personal opinion, we arent going to crash any time soon. This is like the early days of the internet, no one knew what it was back then. And today... we cant live without it!
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:51:51
Awesome, this is what we need!
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:26:43
Oh boy. What a mess lol.
So many grey areas. I think they need to define things sooner rather than later in regards to bitcoin.
This thing is taking off faster than anyone imagined. If they don't move soon, they will be lost in the dust imo.
@_date: 2013-08-28 17:18:17
There is a fine line between genius and insanity they say
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:00:57
Yeah, I hear you. Sucks that entry into the market is so difficult now. Hope you find a good solution!
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:21:56
Hey me too!!! :D rock on!!

Yay Queenie! 
@_date: 2013-09-13 20:27:31
Go to a site like gyft.com and buy a gift card. Turn it into something tangible. You just made that "air currency" something real. 
If you wanna get fancy... modern alchemy. You just turned electrons into something tangible.
@_date: 2013-01-24 04:44:19
Sheesh... I love this!
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:18:30
Up to 2k amazon gift cards from them. Pretty sweet
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:33:36
Awesome dude! glad you found the file!
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:21:32
@_date: 2013-01-23 02:07:30
You might actually be better off simply just buying coins and letting them go up in value. Price spike has been considerable in the past week.
@_date: 2013-01-17 18:50:22
Just freakin ... wow. This is getting nuts, but in a good way!
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:38:34
Last time the drop happened, it was due to an attack on the primary exchange. Ie. Gox.
Now that we have other exchanges to pull value from, it will be far more difficult for a "manufactured" crisis such as a ddos to effect bitcoin.
I don't think it will be going back down any time soon.
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:26:17
Two weeks!!
@_date: 2013-03-18 18:24:36
Lol yep. But there is good info there from time to time.
@_date: 2013-05-24 01:43:17
I might have to check it out. Guy is in my town!

Not backing up my wallet, then my ssd fried on me :/ small loss... but still. One learns fast from those kind of errors.
@_date: 2013-02-22 21:44:43
It has been tested here.
About 200 mhash/sec
 
Still horrible for mining, might be sick gaming for sure. 
Better off with ATI for mining imo.
Please note many gpu miners will be switching over to other alt currencies (such as litecoin) after the prolifigation of asics hits.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:10:36
Much respect to Colas. One of the few economic journalists who has done his homework.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:12:44
I think its a natural evolution of being involved in the community.
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:36:58
So tempted to do this for my office. So ensues "what is bitcoin?"
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:48:07
Funds moved.
Thanks Haeqon for the update.
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:40:54
If worst comes to worst, try localbitcoins to find a buyer.
Then move to the exchanges and trade using those.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:46:16
Hah... missed out.. but good shit man! :D
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:36:24
Wow... loving all the bitcoin adoption!
@_date: 2013-01-26 17:59:51
Litecoin has been out for a couple years now and is considered one of the major forms of alt-currency. There have been others that have popped up etc but have been killed by 51% attacks or just no interest.
I think that 2 years is good enough for a base to get started. And there are already trading forums for them as well.
You can get your GPU to mine them.
Use? From what I've seen its been used for lower cost trades etc. Where one isnt willing to send a bitcoin due to value. 
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:38:33
Its actually faster for me to use Dwolla vs Gox transfer. 
@_date: 2013-09-19 22:52:50
Check out btc.sx 
@_date: 2013-01-25 17:08:11
Crap and I just transferred funds to them. Time to move them out fast.
Bastards! 
@_date: 2013-01-26 17:55:59
You can use CGminer to do it. The conf file will need to have a line of --scrypt. There is more to it than that, but there are tutorials floating around.
As it uses a different algorithm.
@_date: 2013-08-26 23:26:05
Maybe use gyft to get an amazon card and go that route? blah blah blah *prime* etc. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 20:25:50
A bit late to the party here. When they say something like that I ask them. "Well, what happens when the government prints up a half billion dollars in 20$ bills" Hopefully a lightbulb goes off about inflation.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:56:27
I just moved it to another wallet I have. I used blockchain for my phone wallet. 
Never keep more there than you can afford to lose. This is a damned wild ride!
@_date: 2013-08-29 16:42:33
Btw. You can flash the peppers to get about 40% extra power. 
Fairly easy if you have the hardware.
I have a 5.0 that i pushed up to 7.1 ish
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:35:27
For tax purposes. How are "mined" coins perceived. I am aware of "taxable events" etc. but if I didnt pay for them, how are they regarded?
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:44:13
If I saw something like this. I would do it without a 2nd thought.
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:06:47
In 5 days from now. Could be a great deal higher when retarget hits.
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:16:42
Damn, thats the kind of luck i want! Congrats for him though!
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:49:07

My brother still discounts it as some hare-brained scheme. I can't wait when he starts asking more about it.

Awesome, I have been looking for a vape recently.
I will be checking the site out more later :D
