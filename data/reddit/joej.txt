OK.  I can let some folks in, tonight. But **do not screw me over** by entering wacky email addresses to get notification spam. I don't have the email verification yet.
I do not have:
* SSL turned on, yet (tbd letsencrypt!)
* a way to onboard new users ... so PM me for an account
* backend code watching the wallets in a db
* front end code to view current status
* front end code to set &amp; manage notifications (email, push, text msg)
* a "please donate" button somewhere
I do have:
* the framework in place
* a dark theme skinning the site
* user login processing / access control or email validation

Also - consider
it seems to watch up to 50 wallets for free

I have the models built in the DB -- Address, Transaction, MultiAddress.
I've added the 80 MtGox addresses.
I'll run the code to populate their info tonight; then add a backend to keep the data up-to-date; then add notifications.
I'll add initial users tonight

OK -- I've got some unused domains and a hosting account. I should be able to get something up tonight.  
PM me if you want in on this "private alpha" service.

This is not a "few person" task, you know.
A [local grad]( stood one up - BitQuick. So, I maybe it is somewhat do-able in the "small"

Hmmm... ebay suggests these physical w/hologram coins are &gt; $3k or more.
So, I'm thinking: Don't touch that hologram!
