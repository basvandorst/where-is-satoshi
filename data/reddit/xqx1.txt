As dubious as tether is, it's unlikely that they're going to go tits-up in the next month or so, so it's a relative safe-haven on the exchanges. I wouldn't be wanting to hold it long-term though, just use it to sit on the sidelines for the volatility to reduce then turn it back into litecoin (for its stability and quick, cheap transfers) or real USD.
As for if it makes sense to cash-out and wait this dip out... well, only if you recon' we're mid dead-cat-bounce and it's going lower.

Remember Betamax? It was technically superior to VHS. But it was a terrible investment.
I note you're not OP, but calling me a shill isn't helpful. 
I wasn't saying LTC was a good investment. I wasn't saying "buy LTC" - I was saying it was technically superior to BTC and to say that LTC couldn't handle today's BTC transaction loads is factually incorrect.
Yet I'm not invested in LTC, I'm invested in BTC and one other alt-coin that I'm not going to mention by name because I don't want you to buy it.
Even though I believe LTC is better than BTC, I don't think it's a fantastic investment because in this crowded field, it's not got a rosy future, simply because it's not got the BTC brand - and there are better altcoins than LTC at doing the job LTC does (note: BCash is NOT one of them).
But BTC's current transaction limit is a f*cking disgrace, and introducing a few of the features LTC has proven would do a lot to improve its future prospects as a currency.
... now you can call me a shill.

Not OP, but I can answer with an analogy.
There are many, many alternatives to the Raspberry Pi. They're cheaper, they're faster, they're more open source, they're more flexible. But the Raspberry Pi was there first, and when you think single board computer, you think Raspberry Pi.
Bitcoin is like the Raspberry Pi.
Altcoins are like Arduino.
ICO's are like C.H.I.P, Banana Pi, Hummingboard etc.
VHS won over Betamax because it was popular, not because it was better. Bitcoin is the go-to currency that it used to trade all the other altcoins and with Lightning and SegWit I expect it will address all the major issues people have with the currency.

My checklist for the bust:
* A big exchange goes bankrupt taking everybody's assets with it.
* You hear on the evening news that warren buffet was right and everyone who lost their money on cryptocurrency should've seen the warnings
* You can make the comment "I just bought some bitcoin" before a business meeting or at a party and reliably get a "are you f*cking nuts?" look from the room.
THAT is when you load in to the remaining coins and make up your losses over the next 24 months (or you instantly loose 90% and need to lick your wounds and repeat).

But there's only one bitcoin.
Over the past 2 months your dollar has been rediculously volitile against the new international standard of value - bitcoin (do a google search, it's okay, there's only one currency named bitcoin so it's far less confusing for users)... so why should I trust my wealth with such a shaky centrally controlled currency?

Obviously its impossible for a casual observer to link a bitcoin wallet with a true identity if the owner is implementing first-class OPSEC; but I reject your wider implication. Bitcoin is highly linkable, and very not-private. If it's used carefully, it \_can\_ be anonymous. But it's very difficult to use it as a currency and remain anonymous.
If you're meeting someone in person, you've just lost the entire value proposition of bitcoin - just use cash. It's easier, cheaper, more fungible, more private and more acceptable.
If you're not meeting someone in person, how can you get your goods without giving away personally identifying information (like a name or shipping address).
But for this weakness, you get two significant advantages:
1. The blockchain is easily trusted due to the fact that it is entirely transparent and auditable.
2. Governments may accept Bitcoin as a legitimate payment method because it is just as easily tracked as VISA and Mastercard.
Others (below) have shown that mixing services easily 'clean' bitcoin for you; but they all ignore the scenario where merchants start searching the blockchain and only accept 'clean' bitcoin. Obviously legal precedents differ in different jurisdictions; but in large parts of the world, stolen goods can be seized from their owners even if they have traded hands multiple times and the current owner had nothing to do with the original crime. Using mixing services exposes you to receiving 'tainted' bitcoin, and as soon as merchants or exchanges start doing background checks on coins - well, mixing services suddenly become far less attractive.
Privacy coins (Monero being the most popular, Masari being the one I like to shill) address this concern, at the expense of you needing to trust the CODE a lot more. You loose the ability to independently audit the blockchain, you accept a non-trivial risk of governments objecting to its use and making the whole thing illegal - but gain the ability to purchase something without the vendor knowing how much money you have, who else you've transacted with, and having your money rejected due to its history.
What I'm trying to say is Bitcoin is NOT PRIVATE, but it can be ANONYMOUS. And there are benefits to this design.
Lets sell it on its merits, educate users in its shortcomings, and tell them how best to manage them.
I understand your frustration in people saying Bitcoin "**transactions are transparent to all, can be traced, and are recorded forever in the blockchain.** " - because obviously these risks can be managed with good OPSEC; but I object to the implied assertion that most people's wallets are private because you have an example of a wallet which is.
Or to put it more bluntly:
Send me  .000001 **BTC** from that wallet, along with the minimum possible details you can give for me to send you a Raspberry Pi via DHL.  Then reply to this comment with the serial number of the Raspberry Pi that was sent (to prove receipt).
After that bitcoin wallet has been used to purchase a normal, physical item from an untrusted vendor, we'll see if reddit can track down the owner of that wallet who's laundering money and killing children for fun, making girls smoke coke from his butt crack.
\[So what's different with Monero you ask: Well, I still know who you are - but I don't know your wallet ID. I don't know how much money is in that wallet, and I don't know if that wallet purchased thousands of dollars of stuff from the silk road or not.\]
To reiterate: I'm not saying Monero is better than Bitcoin. I'm saying Monero is better than Bitcoin when you need financial privacy. But by not being private, Bitcoin is easier to trust. Bitcoin is better than Monero if you need trust.
Bitcoin is good enough that we can be honest about its weaknesses, and promote it on its real strengths; we don't need to make excuses for (or worse - outright deny) its shortcomings.

Because that's all that's for sale, and if you ask any Bitcoin miner what they're using you get the same answer - an antminer.

There is no question about that. Monero was only possible because of what Bitcoin did, and Monero will never replace Bitcoin. 
In my opinion, "Don't buy Monero" has been a very successful campaign, if Bitcoin wants to adopt it, go right ahead. That's what open source is all about. 
... But credit where credit's due hey? 
It's a great slogan that works just as well for Bitcoin as it does for Monero. On behalf of everybody in the Monero community who has absolutely no authority to speak on behalf of the Monero community, I give you permission.
In fact, I'll just go one step further and say it would be downright AWESOME if Bitcoin cherry-picked stuff that worked in smaller alt-coins and integrated those features into 'Bitcoin'.

You make me want to plug my favourite privacy-based altcoin.
I disagree with you about tether and have posted more about it here,  but I totally accept that we have made different decisions based on the same facts and my opinion is no more valid than yours.
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:38:19
Hey, usually I'd let this go but given you're a moderator I'll give you my uneducated opinion :)
I think a tether double-spending article is 100% off-topic for bitcoin. I don't agree that tether is just another altcoin (I'll get into why), but I do agree that this is an altcoin problem that's totall not newsworthy.
Second, as  pointed out below; we've all got the same information about tether publicly available and people basically now fall into three camps: (1) those who haven't done their own research; (2) those who've read the audits and come to the conclusion that everything's fine; or the impact of a USDT disaster won't be that great; (3) those who've read the audits and don't believe they're good enough.
So, I do think that general USDT stuff should be kicked off the forum; or at the very least a 1 article on the first page or 1 article a week rule or something like that is entirely valid.
But my reason for this reply is to make one point: isn't just another altcoin subreddit. Yes, it's not and almost all industry-specific or not-specifically-bitcoin stuff should be treated off-topic and re-pointed there. But for most people Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency are one and the same; so I think it's right and proper for to be "exceeding generous when it comes to entertaining" topics which present a cryptocurrency-wide systemic market risk.
With USDT, I agree with you. There's now a real alternative to USDT (TUSD) for investors, and there's now plenty of articles easily available on Google; so I don't think there's much value in republishing stuff.
But I make this reply in the hope that when something gets posted about a large exchange being dodgy or some altcoin or non-bitcoin ... thing ... is potentially introducing risk to the market which could materially affect bitcoin; then it be allowed on Specifically with respect to Tether - and totally off-topic for I think USDT and TUSD are different from other altcoins because their entire purpose is to facilitate the crypto/bitcoin market. They're very much like fiat --&gt; bitcoin gateways; and unlike other altcoins, people's belief that they are 'like cash' or 'cash backed' means that people treat them like cash. Personally, I'm not convinced that tether hasn't got 50% or 80% more tokens outstanding than they do cash in the bank, and that sort of artificial liquidity could mean the entire market/price is very artificial. But, I don't have any information different from and he comes to the opposite conclusion. Furthermore, there's no guarantee that one of the 10 big exchanges isn't secretly creating coins/cash/tokens out of thin air either. So while I don't agree 'the risk has passed' I do agree 'it's not a big enough risk to warrant discussion on Lastly, (perhaps most importantly, and perhaps a little contradictory to what I've just said) - Things that affect the bitcoin market and the bitcoin price are better suited to or Rather than delete posts, if the moderators kept pointing people to those forums for market discussions - then USDT would simply fall into that category, regardless of it poses no risk, or is an imminent threat.

In Australia it's counted as capital gains, so if you hold for more than a year it's taxed at 50% of your income tax rate; if you hold for less than a year, it's taxed at your income tax rate.
If I buy 100 bitcoin for $1,000 each; then they go to $10,000 and I cash out 10 bitcoin, keeping the other 90 as bitcoin; then the taxman work it out with unit pricing:
2013: (when I purchased 100 bitcoin)
Buy 10 BTC @ $1,000ea = $10,000 cost
Buy 90 BTC @ $1,000ea = $90,000 cost
2018: (when I sell 10 bitcoin and get my original money back)
Sell 10 BTC @ $10,000 = $100,000 revenue
Hodl 90 BTC @ $90,000 cost or $900,000 mark to market [value doesn't matter to the tax man until you sell].
Therefore, they see income as $90,000. Tax in Australia would be about 15% of Sale ($100,000) - Cost ($10,000) = $90,000 meaning $13,500 tax.
If I did the same thing purchasing in november 2017 then taking profits in december 2017, tax would be at my full income tax rate (eg. about 30% of $90,000 = $27,000)

It depends on what exactly "the issue at hand" is. 
You were saying "perhaps a reason adoption is so low is [power consumption]" which is pretty easily disprove - Bitcoin doesn't NEED a mining pool anywhere near the size it has. The power consumption is directly proportional to the number of people mining bitcoin, which they are doing (in this scale) out of their own self-interest. Bitcoin would use exactly the same amount of power if it had 1 transaction every 10 minutes as it would if the transaction volume of visa was batched &amp; segwitted and jammed into the mempool.
The reason it takes a month's worth of power for a single transaction is that individuals are willing to spend a month's worth of power to enter the bitcoin mining lottery. In a capitalist society, this isn't a problem. Nobody's making them use that power, and bitcoin would function just as well with a mining pool 1/10th of its current size.
But it reaches an equilibrium - if bitcoin's mining pool gets so big that it takes ten months of power to complete the PoW, people will move to other coins (BCH, LTC, etc) to turn their power into money.
From an economics standpoint, the power consumption of BTC is determined by:
* The number of competitors (changing complexity)
* The input cost of power (changing cost)
* The unit price of 1 BTC (changing revenue)
And is paid for by the miner, not the user.
If you're saying this is an environmental issue, then that's a straight issue of power pricing. If carbon were priced correctly, it would be uneconomical to mine with coal power; but if someone wants to mine BTC with their hydro power, they can be my guest.
Eventually the world might change from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, but lets just wait for that technology to be proven. 
The problem with PoS is that it rewards the incumbents (the rich get richer) and if a malicious actor is trying to get the instrument value to zero, then PoS allows them to only 'spend' the instrument (ie. something worthless) to do it; not something externally valuable (eg. power).
Then there's that whole thing that ITOA and Nano do - but again, lets wait until it's been attacked &amp; tested.
(edit: and of course you'll never see that in Bitcoin because of the vested interest, but Bitcoin may not always be  so it's feasible that PoW/PoS eventually fades out from cryptocurrency -- but it is integral to blockchain technology (which has other applications than just currency)  - so I expect it'll exist in some form well into the future)
PoW is like democracy - it's not a great system... but it's better than everything else we've tried.
But the critical point is it's not YOUR power that BTC is using, and you're not indirectly paying for that power. Furthermore, by using BTC you are not incrementally increasing the overall power consumption.
Since bitcoin price is roughly determined by supply &amp; demand (buyers vs sellers) it's the HODLers who are causing the price to go up, and thus the increasing power consumption. If more people transacted in bitcoin (ie. sold their bitcoin), there'd be a higher velocity of money - allowing for more transactions with the same number of coins in circulation (and same coin value).

Bitcoin does not NEED a months worth of power for a household for a single transaction.
If the entire mining network were made up of a single Raspberry Pi, consuming 5w of power, that would be enough to process Bitcoin's global transaction load.
The aggregated high power requirement is a direct result of the mining community using power to _compete_ for the right to process a block.

That's a very smart move from an exchange. 
Though, you do have to trust upbit that they won't go broke themselves in the process.
To mitigate this risk, the other big exchanges are better doing the following:
1) Issue their own USD (or local currency) 1:1 instrument.
2) Have a standing buy order for $0.99.
3) Have a standing sell order for $1.01.
4) Allow buyers and sellers to place market orders (which will logically be limited to $0.991 - $1.099
5) Have a bank account in which $0.99 will be deposited for every token they sell for $1.01 and $0.99 will be withdrawn for every token they buy back.
6) Have an independent audit of that one bank account every week/month to give exchange users confidence.
7) Profit from the spread.
There's actually nothing stopping one of the industry elders from doing this and putting tether out of business; but it'd actually make more sense (risk vs reward) to be done at the exchange level.

I have purchasing a Porsche 911 "planned". I'll lend it to you if you like. Just pay me now, and I'll lend it to you when I get it. Sound fair?
An exchange that goes live without any ability to withdraw the asset you just exchanged cash for is failing in its most basic function.
It'd be like a stock exchange going live, but with the 'feature' that gives you proof of ownership of your shares, or the ability to sell your shares privately or on any other exchange "planned" (for release at some uncertain date in the next decade).
Until they allow you to withdraw crypto, this isn't an exchange, it's basically a crypto-stapled private investment fund.
Keeping your crypto in an exchange wallet is a bad idea. It's how you become a victim of an exit scam. .. and as OP said - until Robinhood give people the ability to exchange USD in your wallet to Crypto in your wallet we shouldn't be endorsing it as an exchange.

Basically - Rich people know how to use influence, money and friends to get and stay in a position of power. This doesn't go away if they loose their money, which is why loads of rich people go bankrupt then get rich again.
Some poor people just haven't had opportunities, and some rich people are just rich because of generations of wealth. These people won't end up in the same place after a 'redistribution event'.
But the vast majority of poor people don't know how to manage money (see what happens to the average lottery winner), and will go back to being poor if they're given a stack of cash; and the vast majority of rich people do know how to manage money and power, so they will take a reasonably small amount of money and make it big again.
So to put it back in context, if BTC became the world's currency, it's far more likely that the vast majority of fiat poor BTC Hodlers would sell their BTC to fiat-rich/ruling-class no-coiners than it's likely anyone currently holding 0.2BTC become the ruling class.

"Better Service" is a great way to make money, but the end goal isn't service, it's CASH. The fact that they're not interested in service is exemplified by the fact that they've released the product without the ability to withdraw because they know they can make money doing so.
If they can make more money letting you withdraw, I'm sure the feature will be added some time in the future.
But if enough idiots sign up and throw cash at them and keep all their assets in the exchange, and RobinHood don't actually have to buy BTC to keep their BTC stapled investments tracking the BTC price, then suddenly they've got millions of dollars they can invest themselves and earn interests on.
In that second scenario, they never release the ability to withdraw because they make more money by not having it.

Yes you can choose your txs, but no, they wouldn't be confirmed.
Let me explain in lamens terms why:
Here's how a bitcoin miner works:
1) Chooses 1MB worth of transactions to verify (by changing the source code you could choose specific txns rather than simply preferring the most profitable).
2) Calculates that those transactions are valid and that they are not double spend.
3) Creates a block for the block chain, then begins the PoW function.
These three steps are very easy. Every miner on the network does these three steps at the start of every 10 minutes, and generates a different block (though many would use the same selection algorithm, so they'd be doing the PoW function on the same block - but that's beside the point).
Now the fun part. Each miner then begins manipulating the block in a defined way using a random number generator to try to find a SHA1 signature that starts with "000000...". The first miner to generate a block with a given number of leading zeros (basically - the one mining rig out of the whole network who comes up with a valid block with the correct garbage at the end to generate a digital signature with the most leading zeros) wins. That's the miner who's block is added to the block chain. The owner of that miner gets 12.5 BTC.
Then, every other node &amp; miner on the network verifies that the transactions and signature are valid (by performing steps 1 - 3 but not the PoW brute-force function, and if it all checks out- they accept that block and uses that as the 'source' for the next block. 
Mining POOLS give the same txn block to hundreds or thousands of workers in the pool, then when one person 'wins the lottery', the pool owner takes a cut then distributes the profits evenly amongst the pool.
So, you can have a mining pool of 1 mining rig, 6 mining rigs a wordwide botnet or a country of ASICs; and as the owner of that pool you can choose which transactions you'd like to push to the blockchain.
Those transactions will become part of the blockchain only if you win the PoW lottery. They will be discarded if you do not.
And your chances of winning the PoW lottery is roughly equivalent to the amount of computing power you are contributing as a percentage of the total global bitcoin mining computing power.

Correct, but an ETF wouldn't be an exchange, it'd be an ETF.
And if the company that was holding all your BTC on your behalf (in your example, the ETF, in this instance, Robinhood) goes bankrupt, you loose all your money.
Conversely, if I exchange cash for MSFT shares on NASDAQ, NASDAQ can go bankrupt, but I still own my MSFT shares. ... like how if binance goes bankrupt today, I still own all the various cryptos that I exchanged and withdrew into my private wallet yesterday.
Robinhood are selling themselves as an exchange - but until they allow withdrawals, they're nothing more than an unregulated derivatives provider.

Market cap is last traded price X total units in existence. It works for say Microsoft shares, because all shares can be accounted for, bought and sold.
But the model works badly for Bitcoin, because it would be impossible to buy 100% of Bitcoin, since some has been permanently lost (lost keys etc.)
It's a bigger problem for altcoins - I can make a new shitcoin, give it a 100% premine of one billion coins, then sell one coin to someone for $1 and suddenly my shitcoin has a billion dollar market cap.
(Note: you could do this with a company too, but the practice is far more common with altcoins)
I'm sure there are flaws in the model, but adding up the total net cash that's flowed into a coin is a much better model than market cap.

Dude, get another account.
I just went through your post history... wow.
If you've got the money you say you do, for the love of god, cash out 25% and spend it on something you love. If you're under 18, get a limo and take a girl to the movies or someshit, if you're over 18, buy a lotus Elise and take it to the track. If you're over 21 - find some hot chick and spend that money at the bar/on a boat/in a private jet - whatever it takes to get laid.
Seriously, nobody on reddit cares what you made on crypto, and you're not winning any friends here claiming that wealth. We're putting your success down to _luck_, not _skill_.
Your post is an excellent example - anyone who's invested for more than 5 minutes knows you wouldn't have sold in 1980 then bought back during the whole iPod thing, because those peaks are only obvious in hindsight.
If I owned crypto in 2017, I would've sold on December 17... Oh wait, I did, and I didn't, because the peaks are only obvious after the fact.
Seriously dude, if you've got $1mil in stocks/crypto right now, do us all a favour and go out and enjoy it - don't sit on reddit trying telling everyone how rich you are. It isn't getting you the respect you think it is.

PROTIP: stick to purchase dates in December 2017.

Also, if you are, fuck you.
Cryptos are for spending, not high frequency trading.
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:42:09
If you're doing that, you're a high frequency trader, crying poor over a tax policy designed to stamp out _exactly that_ paricidic practice.
Crocodile tears cry for you.
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:03:02
Well, let me put it another way.
If you want cryptos taxed like a currency, start by using them as a currency, not just another investment asset to make you rich.
If you're just trading cryptos to get rich, don't cry poor when governments legislate them like pyramid schemes.
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:13:59
Nope. 
I just remind myself the market doesn't care what I bought it at, and all that matters is the expectation for the future.
I was bullish at 18k, I'm still bullish at 6k.
There are some of us out there still "buying the dip"... Just not as excitedly as we were a few months ago :)
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:24:29
Yes, yes it does.

0.05% fees of about 25% of the world's cryptocurrency trading.
They charge more than $5million to list a coin on their exchange, and coins are lining up in droves to get listed.
As an added bonus, they're a highly respected member of the cryptocurrency community. They've handled a number of tough situations very, very well.

Fine. Just f*cking Fine. 
It just reminds me why I stopped putting money into the share market.
Nevermind that I could've bought a small car with the money that I've lost since December, I have an overwhelming sense of _pride and accomplishment_ being the proud owner of some BTC.
It'll go up eventually, it's just time to ignore it for a while and buy more when you can afford it whenever it goes lower. 
I find the key to happieness at times like this is not to dwell on the past. Mistakes were made, can't change that now.
It's just a gentle reminder of what people were saying in December: Don't gamble with money you can't afford to loose.

Imho Bitcoin is held in the vast majority by very rich, very immature "investors"
You can't teach someone who keeps winning.
The older &amp; poorer amongst the community have learned the hard way with penny-dreadful stocks. 
"Buy the dip" has worked for Bitcoin every time before. I recon it will again now. ... But one day, it won't.
Until that day is 5 years in our rearview mirror, the crowd won't listen.

Sure, it adds volume, it stabalizes small bumps, it removes arbitrage and returns healthy profits to its owners.
But, it also does a great job of destabilizing the markets, so big swings become massive, and a market crash in one market is immediately felt in all others.
It takes the human reasoning and circuit breakers out of our markets to they all behave as one. Thanks to bots, there is no longer a "property market" and a "share market" which buffer each other by being inversely correlated. There is now just one market with different "asset classes"
Small and medium bumps are all smoothed out, but then it all goes from 'everything is okay' to 'subprime mortgage crisis' in a heartbeat and without prior warning.
That's why.

So, POW is still the only reliable chain selection mechanism - meaning everybody arguing that POS is the answer to the energy requirements of crypto hasn't done their research?

In countries that don't properly price in the environmental cost of coal (like my home country - Australia), there is no cheaper energy than dirty coal power.
Mining bitcoin is a bit like buying a new apartment block. There's an environmental cost, but investors don't care about environmental costs. They will do it as long as the rental returns cover the construction and ongoing costs. It's up to governments to ensure that the environmental costs are correctly passed on to the investors.
Solar may eventually become cheaper than coal on its own, but the only way it's cheaper _right now_ is if governments, as representatives of the people, make coal artificially expensive to account for the environmental cost.
Mining bitcoin a pretty direct way of turning power into cash; so it's kind of a new problem. But Bitcoin Mining isn't the root cause of the issue, it's a symptom. The root cause is power (carbon) pricing.
My biggest (current) problem with PoS is that while all this noise is made about it fixing the environmental problems of PoW - the only way PoS can seem to work is as a hybrid system (PoW + PoS) .... which means we're right back to square 1 and running PoW for blockchain integrity.

I sort of refined my point by the third post - sorry for the directed attack. A better way of putting it is "this seems like exactly the practice which this tax is targetting.
That said, retrospective taxes suck balls, and have no place in civilized society.
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:25:46
In Australia Bitcoin is treated exactly the same as buying and selling company shares. It makes tax accounting an absolute bitch if you use it as a currency.
But since 95% of the current crypto community seem to be "HODLing to the moon", and "investing" in any shitcoin likely to go up in value, I can hardly blame them. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:59:49
Bullshit it's not about the money.
They've seen all their friends go and buy lambos and they want part of the pie.
They know that being on the inside of an industry that's taking massive profits is far more profitable than negotiating a hefty wage.
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:34:13
Does it apply to regular shares and other asset classes as well?
Much of the world is categorising crypto as an asset class rather than a currency - and given that's exactly like how most HODLers are too, it doesn't sound to me like unreasonable legislation.
I'm not saying I like it, I'm just saying it sounds reasonable.
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:07:04
First, retrospective tax policy is unfair and has no place in civilized society.
But importantly - how does that tax policy compare to current  polish tax policy on investing in shares and derivatives?
