I donate regularly to lifebox ( Great cause if you're looking for new charities - they buy medical equipment for areas that don't have it

Where are you going to live if you don't buy or rent a house? If you do end up spending money for a roof over your head and the electricity goes out will you not pay your electrician to fix the problem?
People aren't going to go backwards in lifestyle just because a currency is no longer inflationary. I'm certainly not going to stop spending money to have a roof, car, phone, internet, heating, cooling, certain luxuries etc etc  just because a currency is no longer inflationary. I have no interest in becoming Amish

I did my part , now you do yours...
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:40:31
Perfect, just what I need!

Yes but that's almost impossible for him to do. You couldn't cut your own nut off without Anaesthetic for one thing. The vagal response and pain would be enough to cause him to faint 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:14:39
We... We... Did it reddit? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:08
He was a doctor and he had access to local anaesthetic which he used. You can do an appendectomy with just local anaesthetic (source; am Dr). Also, he had help and at one point he fainted during the procedure.
I think people are going to be very disappointed if they actually expect that from him 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:38:17
lol, do you people actually think he's going to do it? At least he's hanging around so we can hope he does something like eat a bull testicle or donate money to charity or something but there's no way he eats his own testicle
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:06:41
In for the shits 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:43:39
If it's a crime to do so and he did, then by definition he's a criminal no?

The images on the company page show a bunch of bitcoin symbols 
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:53:59
Coinbase isn't the only place to withdraw from. Crypto can be moved to other exchanges that allow much larger withdrawals you know.. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:54:47
The article does state that all payments will be done through BitPoint. I don't know any Japanese so can't comment on what the links themselves mean, but it seems to fit with what was claimed 
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:21:07
Wow I really hope you didn't actually sell it all
