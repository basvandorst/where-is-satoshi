I think my post got censored, you not only need bigger blocks for more people but also if the same amount of people wants to use bitcoin for more transactions.
Check the last blocks - I transact a lot of BTC and it's getting harder and harder to quickly get confirmed on the next block, but confirmations is what Bitcoin is about. I need quick confirmations to work efficiently.
Blocks take longer to find and they are pretty full these days, to get a fair amount of confirmations you usually have to wait HOURS - this is not what I signed up for, and I will drop Bitcoin for the next best Altcoin ASAP. If I could wait all day for my transactions to go through or if I wanted to pay outrageous fees I would use traditional banking.
Quick, near free and effortless transactions is what digital currency can offer to all of us, now if you decide to hold Bitcoin down and make it slow and expensive for everyone you will just pave the way for the next best thing.
This farce "debate" is going on forever, yet it makes no sense to stop natural development for the sake of "debate". Effectively I see no argument for keeping any arbitrary Blocksize cap right now. You can always develop alternatives like the Lightning Network and implement them ASAP, but why do I have to suffer until you finish developing said alternatives? I am effectively losing a lot of money on this bullshit and feeling forced to migrate to another crypto where I can actually transact money instead of just looking at it sit in my wallet.
I guess most people here really only buy and hold so they might not realize what's really going on here. Transacting BTC right now is a pain! It's slow and unreliable. Bitcoin is really useful while you can USE it, I mean I really love it, I don't want to switch to some copycat clonecoin, but right now these developments are catastrophic. Make Bitcoin usable for everyone again, stop artificially constraining it's usefulness!
