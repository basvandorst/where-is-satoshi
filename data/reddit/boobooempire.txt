I'm not talking about people not accepting their tips.  I'm talking about individual changetip accounts that are owned by the same person.
  
1) Create reddit account.
  
2) Create ChangeTip account.
  
3) Repeat as much as you can handle.
  
4) Start tipping yourself as much as you can handle.
  
5) ChangeTip *is* popular!
  
Now, I didn't do this.  I just rotate accounts a lot and end up picking up tips along the way.  It's innocent enough on my part, but I can see how it can skew these numbers.

@_date: 2014-12-12 03:11:48
That's not actually true from what we have seen.  The act of using bitcoin does not make the price go up.  The price depends on the environment and rules surrounding its acquisistion.  The price on Coinbase is much different than the price on localbitcoins, for instance.  Also, we've seen that adoption doesn't necissarily equal higher price as you can see with the last year of bitcoin price.  In fact, more people actually using it as in spending it, seems to make the price sort of *slippery* as best I can describe.  Adoption does not = price.  Everyone could stop spending it on goods today and depending on conditions, the price could still go up!

It's incredibly unlikely that there will be a circumstance in the next 10 years where you won't be able to acquire the source needed and bitcoin will be worth needing that source.  If it succeeds, you will always be able to decrypt.  Someone will have it and offer it as a service should a service be needed.

You just admitted the the price should go up.  If the price is determined by supply and demand like you said, then the price should go up when the supply is constricted.  The daily supply from mining will be constricted by 50% sometime in 2016, never to return.  So shouldn't that mean that the price will go up?

Topic 419 - Gambling Income and Losses
The following rules apply to casual gamblers. Gambling winnings are fully taxable and you must report them on your tax return. Gambling income includes but is not limited to winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casinos. It includes cash winnings and the fair market value of prizes such as cars and trips. For additional information, refer to Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income or review Do I Need To Claim My Gambling Winnings and Can I Deduct My Gambling Losses? on IRS.gov.
A payer is required to issue you a Form W-2G (PDF), Certain Gambling Winnings, if you receive certain gambling winnings or if you have any gambling winnings subject to federal income tax withholding. You must report all gambling winnings on your Form 1040 (PDF) as "Other Income" (line 21), including winnings that are not subject to withholding. In addition, you may be required to pay an estimated tax on your gambling winnings. For information on withholding on gambling winnings, refer to Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax. If you are considered a nonresident alien of the United States for income tax purposes and you have to file a tax return, you must use Form 1040NR (PDF), U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. Refer to Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, and Publication 901, U.S. Tax Treaties, for more information.
**You may deduct gambling losses only if you itemize deductions. However, the amount of losses you deduct may not be more than the amount of gambling income reported on your return. Claim your gambling losses on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF) as an "Other Miscellaneous Deduction" (line 28) that is not subject to the 2% limit. A nonresident alien of the United States cannot deduct gambling losses.**
**It is important to keep an accurate diary or similar record of your gambling winnings and losses. To deduct your losses, you must be able to provide receipts, tickets, statements or other records that show the amount of both your winnings and losses. Refer to Publication 529, Miscellaneous Deductions, for more information.**

2) There are two types of capital gains that I am familiar with, short term and long term.  If you're a hodler then you'll likely be paying long term capital gains which is something like 15%.  I would avoid Circle if you don't want to be on the hook for capital gains.  Avoiding capital gains comes with a lot of headache.  If I wanted to avoid it, I would acquire btc anonymously.  It can be done, save up a good stash and find a seller and expect to pay a premium.. but I think that premium will be nothing compare to that long term 15%. ;)
  
4) You are only on the hook if you sell.  If bitcoin truly succeeds then there will come a day when you won't have to sell it. I know that's cliche but it's true.  I think it's reasonable to assume that the IRS won't be able to really enumerate the blockchain for a while.  So it would be very hard for them to prove you didn't buy sushi with it.

There are legitimate reasons to not talk about the breach publicly that have nothing to do with any deficiency on Bitstamps part.
  
From what we can tell, they have moved to a more industry proven method of distributing their infrastructure as opposed to owning it all in house.  The ability to identify your strengths and weaknesses and overcome them is important for any successful business.  They are demonstrating that ability here by employing proven solutions and distributing the workload amongst the best in their fields.  Amazon is very good at protecting their infrastructure.
  
In the mean time, they are preserving evidence for proper review and and possible action.

If you lose your bitcoin it's gone.  In the case of most online services, you do not control the private keys.  It's up the the provider if you get reimbursed.  Exchanges already do a lot to limit their liability by keeping small amounts in hot wallets and the rest in cold.   That way, even if they're hacked, they only lose what they can stand to lose.  I'd bet anything that exchanges like Bitstamp only keep as much in the hot wallet as they can afford to lose.  I would expect any established exchange to cover the losses.  Bitstamp, Kraken, Coinbase etc..
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:38:41

The problem is identifying the dump points.  The coins get obfuscated from a blockchain pov but if you can catch an output and trace it back, you may be able to learn more about the source and the rest.  What we need is wallets that are built to identify these coins and report on it.  We can crowd source a lot and be in a position to self police if the coins are tracked to dump points, no matter how small.  I am not proposing nor would I condone any kind of special treatment for the coins, but rather just information gathering and openness in a way that allows the public to access and analyze the data.  I would opt into this at a certain level and would actively tag the source of these coins if presented the option as long as it did not impact my ability to use them.

It is getting harder for me, I live in the US, so maybe that's why.  I guess I should qualify it as getting bitcoins at market rate.  I used to find deals on craigslist, that dried up last year, localbitcoins had local sellers I could meet in person and that's drying up and being taken over by scammers who probably live on the other side of the planet.  It's not the same and I feel it will only get worse.
