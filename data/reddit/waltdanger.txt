Wow with those gains you will be richer than Warren buffet in like 5 years, keep it up!!

Please provide a legal justification for why you 'deserve' the coins that isn't 'because i want them really bad wahhh' 
Or am I supposed to believe that had you not lost the coins, you would have sat on them for years and be CRYPTOBILLIONAIRE lolz. Fat chance, you would have traded them for a pizza or lost your keys because your Wallet software opens a JSON server with no authentication and full wallet access or got hacked like every other moron who thinks the same, which is why there is a real world lack of them.

Formaldehyde emissions are actually a problem with ASIC miners.

Except exchange transactions are off-the-chain so good luck with that. Blockchain solves our decentralization Byzantine problem!!ReVOlUTioNARY!11
Now Let's all use and trust centralized Exchanges and Pools who store their data in internal MySQL databases they completely control  - the bitcoin community.
the tears over being double fucked by Magic the Gathering Online Exchange is even more hilarious
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:19:27
Other than you being greedy and having no right to the Bitcoins than anyone else, including Mark. You got the fiat you were out and have been made whole.

There is no confusion!

Don't hand over your private keys to a fucking online exchange for Magic the Gathering programmed by some moron who just read a couple PHP tutorials?

Yeah tax fraud is always a smart move

Bitcoin? I don't think it's possible. Would probably need alien tech or advanced quantum computers.  Though it isn't inconceivable you could see merging of pools, then you just need one malicious pool operator.
All the little shitcoins that use PoW? Completely within reach. There are pools that have &gt;50% of the coins hashpower for certain coins. Just one guy messing with the stratum the pool uses could completely control all transactions based off that currency. 
I still admire Bitcoin a bit, it isn't a real solution to Byzantine General's problem but the way it puts PoW together with blockchain rewards to create a currency was definitely innovative. More of a cool thought experiment than in practice. But there are other ways of dealing with the double spend problem that don't start arms races of hashpower and electricity usage that would be more ideal for real world usage.

You have a feeling! Wow. Keep presenting your side as fact and confusing what you WANT to see happen as what HAS happened, which was the original point.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:33:58
Yeah it is unsolvable. But there are many other "good enough" solutions that don't involve using the electricity of a small country to process less transactions than which take place in a single sports stadium at half-time.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:12:11
Considering peoples faith in Bitfinex and Tether, yeah.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:22:54
Blockchain is a dumb overhyped technology not suitable for most applications, and hash tables and Merkle trees have existed for many decades. Blockchain solves no interesting database problems at all, not even trust less applications, because the Byzantine Generals problem is impossible to solve. A single person with superior computing power could take over the entire blockchain in proof of work systems, meaning even with 99.99999% honest Generals you could have betrayal. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:25:43
Ahh, Bitcoin, the currency you should never spend.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:55:16
Yeah probably not a good idea to invest when Tax Day is 5 weeks away and the people who "made money" on crypto in 2017 have to pay their Capital Gains tax. The people who made money in 2017 are also likely to have immediately re-invested back into BTC or other shitcoins, some owing more capital gains tax than they make in a year at their real job, and to pay that tax they will be forced to sell their shitcoins. Which will drive the price downward more.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:13:34
Yes that is one such system. The idea being that those who hold stake in a currency also hold stake that it doesn't become corrupt. One rogue actor wouldn't be able to compromise it, such as possible in PoW systems where pool stratums could be compromised, and it doesn't use a ridiculous amount of electricity to operate by doing stupid useless random guessing at math problems. I'm a much bigger fan of PoS than PoW.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:23:42
This is the dumbest thing I've ever read. Hint, you are not an early adopter. Bitcoin has LOST adoption because it is too volatile and expensive to use as a currency, not to mention the heavy link between cryptocurrencies and illegal activities. Newegg and Steam stopped accepting Bitcoin because of these reasons. No one wants to touch this shit with a ten foot poll.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:53:34
what a dumb trash article. any deflationary currency is inherently biased against the poor. Hint, the recent stock market plummets are caused by the Capital class and their fears of inflation (aka wage growth). Bitcoin is deflationary, it's a libertarian wet dream and would ground the poor into dust.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:06:36
So you think because you are a "creditor" you deserve more than what you are owed? It's not going to happen.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:32:09
The bad actor is following the rules. The only rule in Bitcoin is "have the longer blockchain" and by Bitcoin's rules, the 51% Betrayer's chain IS the most valuable one.

They would never default on their treasuries unless they wanted to convert the US to a 3rd world country in a single day. They can always just print more money and call it "quantitative easing" 
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:17:04
Why would they sell stock (which is maybe 40% overvalued by fundamentals) to get into crypto (which is 100% overvalued by fundamentals)?
The stock market is due for a major correction and traditionally investors pull money out to invest into treasuries during downturns. Because treasuries are as safe as it can get, and even if you only make 0.75% that is better than eating a loss.

The worst that can happen is Federal prison. You don't fuck around with the IRS but I agree with you, a lot of the people who made money on crypto are younger Libertarian IT janitor types who think their pro skills at resetting someone's Windows password means they can outsmart the IRS. I can't wait for the inevitable IRS-audit-ruined-my-life posts.

lol. That's why I said overhyped. They will leverage blockchain technology to decrease your cost basis by synergizing with your cloud platform! 
Or, you know, stick with proven transactional databases to do the actual work.
