Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:31:51
Coming back to this post in 5 years. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:43:26
Do you have a link to your description? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:56:36
Saved, back in 4 weeks. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:13:32
Huh! I forgot about this. Honestly though, had you told me we were going to break 1k only two months after I wrote this I would have called you crazy. I now believe by December 2014 bitcoin will have crossed 25k and litecoin 1k. A part of me thinks that even those mind bogglingly huge numbers are a conservative estimate...

Upvoted for awareness of Luke-jr. Sidechains are not secure, especially as bitcoin mining becomes more and more centralized.
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:09:34
Thank you for being a voice of reason.
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:14:27
Satoshi Nakamotto will be bigger than Jesus. They will build statues of him. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:36:00
Sidechains may work but it isn't going to stop blockchain bloat. People are going to add data to the blockchain no matter what. I wish the core devs would stop fighting it and give us the full 80 byte OP_RETURN. That way we will at least have an elegant way of embedding data versus creating unspendable outputs.  
@_date: 2012-11-16 04:47:08
Interesting. Thanks for the link 
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:39:34
I love you! PM'd 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:57:51
Ouch, that sucks. I bought one bitcoin a year ago just to mess around so I can only imagine what it feels like to lose 40. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:43:26
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:34:56
I'm using a 4 year old macbook.
@_date: 2013-08-14 20:43:30
Lets shoot for ~1k
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:59:49
Why? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:49:15
Me next!!
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:43:06
Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:58:57
I want this.
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:47:52
IMO, there are 3 alt coins that are truly innovative and important. Peercoin for the Proof of Stake, Primecoin for it's prime number search, and Namecoin as a decentralized DNS/SSL replacement. Zerocoin will make it 4 pending it works as advertised. 
Bitcoin will become so valuable that nobody but early adopters will transact with it. There is a gigantic case for alt coins. This is going to be a multiple cryptocurrecny world whether the Bitcoin fat cats like it or not.   
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:42:26
Not that either, just double checked. They are pretty scummy. Thanks for your help though. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 06:21:56
They do, thank you for finally taking a stance. Alts are here to stay
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:26:36
Gollllddddd! Thank you to whoever did this. You rock. With all said and done this situation was entirely worth it when you consider how many people knew nothing about bitcoin are now aware of its existence.     
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:42:01
Fantastic summary. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 00:24:50
The GUI aspect was appealing to me since my hardware/knowledge is older and less compatible with current vanity address generation techniques. I'm so thankful for krillcoin right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:41:03
Awesome! Maybe with these types of funds our modern day Robin Hood can spread some serious bitcoin awareness in other big subs.  
@_date: 2013-10-14 23:16:40
I will be, thats why I've made all necessary precautions :)  
@_date: 2013-09-23 21:38:24
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:21:49
Mike is awesome. I love hearing him speak 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:03:12
Thank you. The Bitcoin community needs to grow up a realize if we are to leave fiat completely we need at least two coins.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:29:12
Hopefully. Had I known this was going to be the response I would have kept to myself. For what it's worth I am really sorry. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:17:20
Now I feel old. I remember when bitcoin broke one dollar. If only I knew what I know now...
@_date: 2013-11-03 15:35:53
Liquidate them my ass. They're gonna hold on to those for dear life and ride this thing to the top. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:16:21
Thank you. I like you too! 
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:52:57
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:06:38
Yep, its not everyday you become the most hated person on r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:01:23
Wow. I suck. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:29:15
Nope. It says my account is under review and to visit the verification link. I knew this would be too simple. I wouldn't use Mtgox but I've had a few coins in there almost since they began trading them. 
  
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:53:13
Worth a shot. Keep this up anyway!
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:48:33
I feel like bitcoin becoming stable is a lot like trying to get a fusion reactor to work. All these bubbles like pulses, bigger and bigger compared to the last until it reaches a critical mass like price point.     
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:16:11
These are clearly different people trying to profit from the Buttercoin concept. Be careful who you are sending coins to
@_date: 2013-10-11 04:16:00
Sounds like my kind of weekend :) Do it again next year and id make the drive down for sure. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:16:24
I tried moving them forever ago but they wouldn't let me. I'm about to try again so we'll see.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:51:04
this is going to be such and an important aspect of bitcoin in the future. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:14:19
Oh man
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:39:47
-92 points?! What in the world. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:19:45
The title was made in a rush. I apologize for any confusion it's caused. I would remake the thread but I think everyone is now aware of someone using this as a scam. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:49:48
Do it
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:57:19
This is the case. In hindsight all I'm saying is if I had seen any of that coinage I would have invested in infrastructure versus drugs. Oh well though, you cant cry over split milk. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 00:10:31
You're awesome. both of you!
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:33:01
I couldn't give you enough upvotes, sir.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:16:23
This cant be real.
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:46:56
Thank you!! I've deleted the program and moved my wallet from the computer. I already imported the private key to the wallet, is it still safe to use or should I remove it as well?
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:38:06
I enjoyed this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:50:33
It'll be for the greater good. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:38:06
Yeah, you cant just give money out like that and expect people not to ask. I understand that in the spirit of things he was giving away to people who had no idea it was coming but after seeing that he did tip someone else who asked I feel a bit singled out.  
@_date: 2013-09-28 06:12:41
Imagine the day some future color'd coin becomes worth more than 1 Btc 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:04:53
Nope. The Chinese don't care that the english speaking bitcoiners feel litecoin is a copy of bitcoin. They will keep buying.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:41:02
Woah I had no clue. 
@_date: 2013-08-31 04:26:37
We'll see 1000 way before 2015. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:55:05
This sucks. But I guess insane luck will always be fleeting and random.
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:00:21
Same here. What's up Coinbase
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:53:01
Yes, the two addresses in the picture are different from the address from the orginal [post]( 
@_date: 2013-10-06 05:04:22
I want one
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:34:06
True. Talk about spreading the love. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:54:51
No doubt its real now that we've seen the verification, but what's the logic behind this?! Maybe though there is none and its just an act of chaotic generosity. We may never know, but bitcoinbillionaire is definitely the hero deserves.       
@_date: 2013-10-13 06:50:23
One day you're gonna be very rich..
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:02:01
Even after we switch to mBTC this will continue to happen. History has already sealed the BTC/LTC pair. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:13:29
They are locked if you aren't verified.
