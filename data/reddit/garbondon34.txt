Yeah cause of the bubble...
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:25:52


New assets always have volatility early on. Its called price discovery and it can take a very long time. Bitcoin is NOT a store of value yet, but it has the potential.


Its not more important. I never said that. USD has many limitations and it has also lost around 95% of its value, other currencies have lost way more way faster.
Bitcoin is an open and voluntary system. If you want to use it you can. If you dont then dont. 


You can trade BTC in the stock market through GBTC, CBOE or CME if you are worried about that....
@_date: 2019-02-13 12:13:04
Yes you are right. 
I would still argue that index funds are not on the same category as things like Bitcoin or gold...
Another thing that contributes to high volatility is that Bitcoin is barely traded on the established markets... wait until that happens to compare it.

We should at least be able to keep the worth of our work...

Thats why I said almost. Bitcoin thesis has shifted to store of value so it makes no sense to use something so secure to buy chinese crap.
Thats why 2nd layers solutions are being developed to address this problem.

When storing assets you also want to be able to retrieve them rather easily... Bitcoin is pretty much the only asset that can offer both sides of the coin.






Yes. That's why I said its a thesis. We don't know if its going to be true, but the data we have so far shows that its an asset that has characteristics that could help it reach that status in the near future.
You think anything can reach store of value without volatility?

So much wrong with this post and all has already been debunked many times.
Bitcoin incentivizes SAVING to buy or create long term productive assets.
People still need to live, nobody is going to forgo buying a phone or laptop today just because it will be cheaper in 2 years.

I have no doubt that its happening, I just don't think its as extreme as they point it out.
Remember CLIMATE INSITUTIONS dont get funding if they say everything is fine. Lol. The more dire the threat the more funding they get.
Why you think America is always at war? Politicians always go over budget? 
In this new outrage world everything has to be exaggerated, otherwise nobody cares.

Do you know how they measured global temperature before satellite data?
Do you know that many of the stations around the world from where the data is gathered were not built for accurate constant measures?
Do you know that previous temepratures have been redacted plenty of times with errors in the 1000s of percent?
Do you know that most of the world doesn't have stations to measure temperature?
Remember when gobal warming meme was proven to be bullshit? As actually some parts are getting colders while others hotter? E.g. ice in a pole is actually increasing..?
**It is true that *CORPORATIONS* not *HUMANS* have a negative impact in climate, but as nations become more developed they pollute LESS.**
What they are trying to do is prevent nations from developing with the BS excuse that they will destroy the Earth. lol. None of the countries are going to stop unless we threaten them with WAR. Which is also exactly what they want to do. Sanctions+war to keep the rest of the earth poor
And of course the "climate initiative" is against nucler, which is basically the safest, least polluting, and most effective source of energy we have. Lol. The cognitive dissonance they have is extreme

Thats because climate change is a meme to impose sanctions on developing countries and increase taxes.
At the same time there is no doubt that pollution is harming the environment. What hasn't been established is how much of a % humans are contributing.
