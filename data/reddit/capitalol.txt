interesting, thanks. But in the situation with my dad, I still think it is a better option for him than to have him using some other technical piece of equipment and a shovel to get at his coins.
@_date: 2014-01-20 07:53:37
Its great that he saved Openbsd, but he is absolutely not a billionaire. I bet he created and posted this himself to try and prop up his ego. Sorry Mirceau, the steps between complete douchebag on bitcointalk and billionaire philanthropist good guy require slightly more effort. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 16:05:53
fair enough. i read below the comment that Trace left about the US seizing assets in a bank vault, so it seems possible however I still think it is highly unlikely. Especially if you visit your box at least once a year and have an account there.
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:57:50
there is also something called a relocker you can get with a safe nowadays - where if it is tampered with, it will initiate a second set of locks that are uncrackable. I will personally be getting one of those.
@_date: 2014-09-03 05:10:25
Thanks. 
And yes, he bought in early after he saw the gains i was making. He is just too old to be able to deal with technical nature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:20:50
yeah pretty much. they sawed it off the foundation, cant saywhether there was safe humping however.
@_date: 2014-09-03 16:07:30
Seems like you need at least a basic level of programming understanding to implement this (and pgp). Although it probably is better and safer than my solution, I still dont know where to start with your example and wouldnt trust myself implementing something like this.

you are right. he is not going to have a copy at home anymore. safety deposit box is the only way after this event.
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:02:32
interesting idea with the PI. I will look into that depending on what happens to the police investigation.
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:59:08
yeah, no. You pay your yearly fee for the safety deposit box and its safe. At least in a western country. Cant speak for where you live however.

i dont know. he has lived in the same house in a quiet neighborhood for 40 years without ever being burglered. Now this happens and it makes me question it. All they took was the safe - nothing else...

No need to name call. I'm saying that anyway you look at it it's not a good idea to walk up to a physical ATM and buy bitcoins that way. If you want bitcoins then buy them online where you can pay the thousands you need to justify the transaction cost without fear of getting mugged.
@_date: 2019-10-19 18:56:44
what are you talking about
edit: are you seriously implying that people are going to use a physical ATM to settle a transaction worth thousands of dollars? Or are you saying that the settlement network is made to handle coffee level transactions? Why are we STILL talking about this? My head hurts.
@_date: 2019-10-19 19:55:22


Yeah but my whole point is that you can't optimize in this way nor, control for that (or other variables) using an ATM. &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2019-10-19 19:33:45


The vendor's fee is % based, but not the bitcoin network transaction fee.


In my town, they certainly do.


No, but you do to justify the transaction cost.
@_date: 2019-04-19 02:50:54


I'm pretty sure the rest of the world serves well enough as a control. 


These have been done as well but over shorter time periods (less statistically relevant) in places like norway and denmark.

Paypal would simply provide another option for safe storage. Having Paypal accept Bitcoin doesnt harm bitcoin at all. It just opens up the market much wider and as a result should drastically increase the acceptance of both users and merchants.

It just means that amateur hour is now over and if you want to seriously play in bitcoin, you will need to devote significant resources to do so.

The difference between coinbase and mtgox is the ability to subpoena due to jurisdiction. If they ever needed records from coinbase, they can always get them whenever they want. Not the case with mtgox, so they are going to try and make that relationship more difficult for US users.

Translation for the part about Bitcoin:
The virtual currency created by a cryptographer in 2009 broke the limit of 1000 dollars. Despite the skepticism of experts of economics, the cyber-criminals and the higher control mechanism imposed by government authorities all over the world, bitcoin's popularity is still high. In the meantime the bank JP Morgan in the USA has deposited a patent of an electronic payment system that is very similar to that used by the cryptocurrency (bitcoin).

Yeah the difference here is that these countries are both stuck in the race to the bottom because they depend on their export markets. What I am suggesting for Argentina is quite different - that they simply say fuck exports and go for a rich populace, being that they have far less to lose than say japan by doing so.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:43:45
People say that all the time, but they do mean something... just not everything. There is quite some room from grey in that black and white. I'm quite confident we've hit bottom now as theres now 70k between us and 70 (at the time of posting there was 50k coins).

Dark pool could be the best way to go, though it will probably take awhile for that order to be filled. So if you think the price is going up now, it would probably be better to just bite the bullet and buy it on gox, even with the slippage.

You could put it that way, or you could put it this way:
Innocent people got killed in Colombia because Colombia is/was a wonderful manufacturing and distribution center (for a multitude of reasons) for those who wanted to mass produce substances which are heavily sought after in other places in the world. 
This phenomenon of exploitation is not, as you would suggest based on the US system of laws. It's based on an increasingly globalized economy. The resources go where the opportunities are. If there is an opportunity to make money burning down a rainforest to feed cows (cash crop), guess where the money goes. How about buying up water rights where indigenous people have lived for thousands of years with no monetary system and then requiring them to pay for the right to use it? Innocent people are killed/ displaced and ecological tragedies occur on a daily basis due to the system we live in. This is a result of supply and demand. I do not see Colombia as any different. 
This is the system we all live in. It's up to you to change your own reality in your own country. You are noone's victim but your own.

If you are ok with it halving (or going down even farther), then yes buy now. It is still a good buy if you are thinking long term, i.e. 1.5 years or more. If you are thinking short term, we are still very much in a downtrend and its certainly a risk to buy right now.

When bitcoin passed 105, yes I became a bitcoin millionaire (I went in with about 50% of my savings when the price was between 6-8). Its a bit surreal really. I want to tell everyone, but at the same time I don't because I don't want them to view me any differently than they did before. Mostly I am just occupied these days with figuring out how to start diversifying. It's a good problem to have I suppose, but not easy with the extremely murky tax situation.

Mining is in absolute gold rush mode right now. If you can actually get your hands on an asic rig, you are nearly guaranteed to be profitable - that being said, do your own calculations especially regarding electricity costs. Also, I don't mine.
