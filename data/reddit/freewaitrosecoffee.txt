My point is that as the blockchain grows in size up to 50GB a year, the ratio will shift dramatically as time goes on. Incoming users will increasingly be SPV users. General public users will be mostly SPV users, and currently it is mostly technology oriented people and investors using the currency.


Are you talking about trusted nodes? As far as I understand it, they aren't required..
Regardless, my general question still stands about the network and SPV security as the ratio of SPV/full nodes changes

Thanks for the response.
I read that they offer *essentially* the same security at the moment because the chance of 51% of the miners being wrong is incredibly small.
So this is part of my point.. Can we really expect the average user to download the entire blockchain just to use the currency? Especially if it's going to grow by up to 50GB per year. It seems that most people will not use a full node. Most people will have to use the *essentially* safe SPV wallets.
So the question remains: does the safety of SPV wallets decrease when the ratio of full nodes to SPV nodes increases?

But wouldn't reducing the block size just mean that blocks are added faster - to account for the same number of transactions?

Interesting stuff - thanks for clearing that up.
How would reducing the block size help? Surely reducing block size and having more blocks in the chain would leave the block chain size unchanged?

For your first point - as I understand it, bitcoin could grow in popularity with the new users opting to use SPV instead of full nodes. As the blockchain size grows, more and more people will opt to use SPV instead of hosting a full node.
I don't understand what you mean in your second point.
