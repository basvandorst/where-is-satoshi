You can buy a small fraction of a coin! You can invest $10 or $10 million, it doesn’t matter. It of course is a gamble though so don’t put in money you can’t afford to lose, though from my experience I’ve gained much more than having a standard bank savings account.

I don't have it because I deleted the wallet

Is that a private key?

...and now I feel like a idiot.

I would be using it to buy Christmas presents for my family as I can not afford any this year. $100 would be able to buy good presents for my 2 sisters and my parents. Thank you so much for the consideration.

I just had an idea based on  vanity gens. Couldn't you just put an entire public key in there and after a while have the private key? This would require the server they hosted the gen on to be very good though.

Is vanitygen safe?

Even though impractical, it is possible. And the electric costs would be on the server

I agree. If I could have a flat scan of it I can redraw what we have of the code.

What do you mean sign up for another? You can put it on your address and send it to him if that is what you mean
