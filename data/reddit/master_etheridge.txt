always drives me mad when someone is spelling 'btcs' - it's a completely different crypto this way...

Usually those are the same people, they just transit between those three sectors (which are very corelated ofc).

solid exchange, in addition i would say that they have 50% discount on BTC segwit withdrawals
@_date: 2019-11-07 19:08:37
You better don't lose your wallet address

Understandable, have a nice day.

True, 24/7 uptime is a global standard for exchanges right now

2014 was a good year

Fantastic news for coindeal, i just wonder in which states it's going to be available first?
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:27:42
Come on guys, it's just a meme, nobody wants to insult your trading skills, we all know how hard it can be to be succesful in cryptoworld, we know it's not coming out naturally and behind that "lucky strikes" stands hard work, passion and knowledge. It's just a funny meme ;d

I also heard that Exodus is not a safe wallet, you should consider changing it. Also you should think if you are interested in creating an account on a cryptocurrency exchange like CoinDeal, or Binance, but this means one thing - providing your personal data, due to the KYC verification process. If you are willing to be more anonymous (remember that in the internet, no one is safe, and it's very, very difficult to be fully anonymous), you should consider buying btc via cryptocurrency payment processors, like for example [ Using such websites, you have to provide less your personal data - by using different payment methods like credit card, skrill, sometimes paypal etc.

They've lost some of my trust over of the recent hack they've suffered. Speaking of CoinDeal, still they have many things to improve, but let's look at the facts - even though they are very young exchange, coindeal managed to become one of the best exchanges in europe and right now they are beginning to expand in the US. I won't be surprised if they become the best exchange soon.

hope that zcash will win ;&gt;
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:56:01
Indeed my friend, indeed - they are giving away 90% of their tokens to their users
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:35:53
Maybe r/CoinDeal \- they've got 50% discount on BTC withdrawal on segwit and you can also lower your fees by staking their utility token (CDL), which price is really nice right now - [ If you want to regularly move your crypto from exchange to wallet or wallet to exchange it will be some cost for you, not matter which platform you'll choose.

I love this movie, watched it couple times. That ath was great, but since then btc had some moments, it's not that bad

It's a common issue, many banks are blocking such money transfers, especially when you are from UK. I've been having the same problem with my cards on coinbase, those regulations are very strict and the only thing that could help is direct contact with the bank. Or try some other exchange like CoinDeal maybe? Never had any rpoblem with them.

This little cart is absolutely adorable and perfectly done. Love it!

Unfortunately I have some bad memories with skrill and epay...

1. The minimum value of a single sale or purchase of **CC** through the Website is the equivalent of: **USD 10.00**.
2. The maximum value of a single sale or purchase of **CC** via the Website is the equivalent of: **USD 5,000.00**.

Wonder how long btc will be on those kits? The deal with sportsbet is technically signed for 3 years, but i don't think we'll see btc logo this long. Actually it's not the first case when Premier League club is doing a sponsorship deal with a company related to cryptocurrencies. Some time ago Arsenal signed a deal with CashBet and recently Wolves extended their contract with european cryptocurrency exchange CoinDeal for another season. Insane brand exposure, especially when your team is also playing in european cup.

you got me there

Altcoins are meh for me, the only long-term strategy can be based on Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-27 16:00:08
[cryptowat.ch]( for me is the best one
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:56:48
It's an American finance company, which provides loans. I have no idea why they are trying to release their own crypto trading platform, it's completely meaningless.
