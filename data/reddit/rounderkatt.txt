Did you see the 71btc sell wall at 10k?
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:20:11
Yes because blockchain is a magic word that does everything... 
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:18:10
It already won. Yah I sold that garbage immediately for real coins

No, downvote brigades handle that. Btc is a giant circle jerk. They don't ever discuss their innovative tech because they don't have any. They just try and convince people that a shitty fork is the "real" bitcoin. It's frankly just sad. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:18:10
I mean, its a pretty serious security issue in that get requests are part of the web logs, while POST parameters arent...
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:00:04
I posted a comment basically saying that exact same thing in btc and was told that I was brainwashed and should call bitcoin "core coin".
There's salt on both sides but at least bitcoin is based in reality. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:22:10
Gee another big mouthed 2 week old account that also shills bcash. Not even surprised at this point 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:14:38
3 weeks here. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:27:15
The amount of stupid in your comment should be painful. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:56:14
I just sent $1500 for 5 satoshi/byte and it took 8 minutes What does your shitty alt coin have now? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:13:16
If you call bitcoin "bitcoin core", we are definitely not on the same team, kiddo. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:45:56
A redditor for 4 weeks, right about the time all the astroturfing starting...totally believable... 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:39:49
My mom just retired and thanks to good investments found that a lot of her 401k was put in at a lower tax rate than the bracket she's in now so she actually lost money. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:20:31
Lol, how'd that work out for yah? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:33:19
Go away.

Great, you have them now. Quit bitching
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:36:10
Assuming your tax bracket is lower in retirement
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:10:42
Wtf are you talking about? Traffic hasn't noticeably changed at all. You shills are delusional. And bitcoin.org is the only bitcoin site. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:26:52
Tell me more, redditor for two weeks
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:10:42
Enjoy your incoming ban.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:15:00
Op is a bitcoin . com spam bot. Mods, banhammer plz? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:11:33
Yup, it held the tide for a good 5 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:00:01
Not much of a prize really though, is it?
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:29:20
Bitcoin is currently about 15 cents to send. You are so very wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:55:34
Lol, found the bcash shill. Do i get a prize?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:45:02
Redditor for 2 weeks shilling against Bitcoin? Weird.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:23:58
It's ok kiddo. 9th grade is hard on us all. It gets better. Just hang in there, ok?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:51:26
Sure thing bud. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:45:34
Well, redditor for 6 weeks. If you think that Trump is actually against consolidation of power, you might want to ask why he has the most nepotistic cabinet in modern presidential history...when you start with a false premise, it's easy to end up with false answers.

God is dead. And stupid, apparently
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:18:25
No they didn't. He lost the popular vote. He only won because an antiquated system that's makes the opinion of the idiot minority weighted more heavily. Back to your safe space, neckbeard. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:01:54
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:25:22
That's called tax evasion and money laundering. They are sort of hip to that
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:26:17
Naw those morons aren't actually in crypto. They don't hodl shit. They just come here to wave their tiny orange flaccid dicks around en mass. Just make fun of them and hodl on.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:26:46
Literally nobody cares, retard.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:27:22
Redditor for 4 weeks. Da comrade.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:06:46
Brain free too.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:38:09
Hey bud. I'm also into AR15s and security. Not really worried about a bunch of mouth breathing Trump tards  either.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:20:25
They aren't just here. They are in a ton of subs. All just a few weeks old and all pumping or dumping crypto and pro Trump 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:56:03
Gee, another two week old redditor spread FUD. Shocking, I say. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:06:51
What are you on about? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:05:09
Trezors sold out on Amazon a couple weeks back and were going for $300-$400 and shipping "in 4 weeks"
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:34:30
Head on back to your safe space, kiddo.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:35:13
How did that work out for yah, captain?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:17:10
He shoots, airball!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:30:20
Yah that's totally not a fucking scam
Protip, no legitimate business takes fucking gift cards.
GTFO with your scammer bullshit 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:54:58
Ok brand new account. Nobody gives a fuck 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:06:50
Redditor for two weeks only interested in bitcoin? Very weird, comrade.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:22:48
Dude, you are fucking delusional.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:48:40
Redditor for 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:19:03
Yup I'd say a vast majority of anti bitcoin and pro bcash posts are from 2 week old accounts. It's pretty clear they bought shills 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:23:42
Cry more for me, neckbeard. I'll dip my cookie in your orange tears.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:19:23
oh kiddo, thats adorable.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:23:43
Shhhh. Adult time now, kiddo 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:49:40
Redditor for two weeks and all posts are on crypto subs. Total shill. Mark this jackass in res
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:35:46
Cool, a two year old article... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:52:29
Can it also be flagged for removal because its the fucking retarded ramblings of an imbecile?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:02:12
Probably not. I wouldn't know. What's it like suckling on the orange withered teat of a reality star to conceal your latent racism and intellectual deficits? Sounds difficult. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:41:12
3 month old bcash shill
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:15:58
Yup, here comes the brigading retarded neckbeards.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:55:02
He also had no way of knowing about ASICS or how large the chain could grow. To expect to find answers to current problems from a 6 year old white paper is like expecting the Bible to teach you to drive a car. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:10:02
Well we already know you're an idiot, so who cares? Just because you're dumb enough to actually vote for that orange idiot, as opposed to the 2 week old Russian shill accounts doesn't really say much about your intelligence 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:43:12
I think it's just adorable that you bcash shills think that you can affect anything by trolling reddit
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:11:46
Yah, 13 morons came running from the Donald to give another loser an internet rimjob to try and defend your dumbass circlejerk. Terrifying.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:44:51
I'm gonna dip my cookie in your tears.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:18:49
You might wanna look up how long it would take to brute force a Bitcoin private key
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:50:38
Oh kiddo, putting together complete sentences is only effort for idiots. Like you.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:54:27
Yah, what if. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:05:17
Redditor for 2 weeks shilling against Bitcoin? Weird!
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:44:42
Low effort. Not smart. Sad.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:38:23
No thanks. But whatever floats your boat. Nobody is judging you here. Well, me, I'm judging you. And everyone else this isn't a moron. But other than that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:41:19
Sure, if you had about a billion years. You might make .00000001 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:02:15
Sorry princess. Maybe the_donald has a safe space for your feelings. Reals &gt; Feels

Bye Felicia! I mean comrade. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:41:47
We don't, but the chances of generated a crypto pair where the public key spells something funny is astronomical
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:32:08
Oh dear sweet summer child.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:07:50
Hush child. You'll look back on this time of your life and cringe. I promise.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:23:28
No, you're a KiA retard. Literally the cringiest of neckbeards. What do you have more of: katanas, fedoras or chins? I'm betting chins.
And hilariously a Russian is here trolling Bitcoin. Go figure.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:10:59
Pretty much. They brute force to find phrases that contain text they want and also confirm to the RFC. To get the private key for that public key they would have to also brute force the private key for a given public key, which is currently impossible.
There's a nonzero chance of generating a key pair that said something funny but it's monkeys on a typewriter territory 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:15:18
A 10 year that ate too much lead paint could know his opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:27:07
Oooo burn!  Er wait, the other thing. The opposite of that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:56:40
Yah it says I'm an incel freak. Oh wait that's the other one of us. The one that's not me. Be humble, neckbeard.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:50
Try again
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:03:29
Two week old user that only posts to the Donald and anti bitcoin stuff. Yah that seems legit 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:08:38

@_date: 2017-12-23 19:47:28
A bunch of cringey teenagers don't make me upset kiddo.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:53:15

@_date: 2017-12-29 04:46:48

I mean really all you gotta do is get fox to say it before that orange idiot tweets it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:31:50
You realize for them to make a profit they have to let it or make it go up, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:43
Woops. Looks like Rockefeller over here might just be full of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:14:35

@_date: 2017-12-26 05:22:11
That's because you childish idiots kept spamming to make the front page. Don't play stupid. Nobody believes you're playing 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:24:56
Low energy idiot. Sad.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:40:53
It's not illegal to call them but it sure is illegal to lie about it. Can't imagine why they would think or be told they needed to lie...

@_date: 2017-12-23 17:10:13

Redditor for 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:36:09
Because I don't need to bribe people? I don't care if people invest in bitcoin. See, because I didn't invest in a garbage alt coin that needs propping up. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:37:26
You mean two of the highest populated states? Yah I guess if only a minority of voters (most rural) had voted it might have been a landslide...if the electoral college didn't give backwater towns larger than fair voting weight it would have been a different kind of landslide 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:34:21
Ok you're an idiot if you think any amount of money can get you nuclear material unless you are head of state. Additionally the ONLY reason to use nuclear material to kill someone is to make a point, and that point is "Im motherfucking Putin". Think what you want, but the ex head of the KGB killing political enemies is not at all out of the realm of possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:33:11
Ok comrade. Hey good luck with another term of Putin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:48:24
Redditor for 6 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:39:32
Wow, redditor for 3 weeks. That's some Olympic level mental gymnastics. You should actually be proud of how much bullshit you crammed into one post.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:32:34
Yah like all these idiots that pled guilty. Someone should tell them too
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:20:36
Back to T-D with you, troll.
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:23:07
It means you have a nice dinner at stake if you lose it all. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:41:49
Oh the Reeeeeeeee is strong with you. Crawl back to safe space over in the donald, kiddo. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:23:34
Who the fuck knows. But in the last month there has been a huge influx of brand new accounts either pumping or dumping crypto and all of them are super pro trump and suspiciously few post on t_d
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:54:58
I dunno, 4chan and twitter elected Trump...

You've clearly never built software in an enterprise environment. 
What happens when an accidental right bracket gets typo'd into your simple change and the WAF sees the base64 encoded page content (for IIS) as cross site scripting and blocks all access to the page?
That is a real example from a company I worked for, and why all changes, even static changes, go through qa
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:43:22
Again, that's not how software development works. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:00:42
Thats not how software development works. Unless that content is managed through a CMS, it needs to go through the full regression cycle
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:02:10
redditor for 1 week, and a bcash shill? shocking
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:58:28
Ah, there yah go. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:03:07


The shills are getting lower budget. Must be a funding issue
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:43:00




I sold that garbage alt coin to any idiot dumb enough to buy it. Bcash blocks arent even valid on the original chain, you are fucking delusional.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:54:11
With a gpu? Did you also calculate in the power for the rig itself or just the card? What about deprication? It generally isn't profitable to mine btc with gpu unless you get free power. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:14:39
And wait like 8 days to be able to make  the purchase. That's how I missed the bottom of the dip. Fuck coinbase
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:11:44
You only lose if you sell or it STAYS at 0.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:22:55
You mean LN? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:35:25
Unless you have free power, you're losing money... 
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:35:23
Tell me more, redditor for 5 days. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:47:56
.... You realize, that's not at all how deductions work, right? You can only deduct losses against profits. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:24:58
The shill tries so hard and fails so hilariously.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:23:05
Woops: 
Should probably update your shitty propaganda folder. Go back to trying to say how blocksize increases are totally scalable long term. That one was hilarious.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:13:32
What kind of a coward creates a throwaway to post this garbage? Stand up for your beliefs, even though they are clearly incorrect, you morally bankrupt jellyfish

Bye shill.
