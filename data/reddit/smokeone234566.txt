Micro transactions mean transactions for a small amount of btc which is a problem now  because the fees can cost more than the amount  in the transaction.  The LN lets folks do "Micro " transactions for very small fees, because they , in my best understanding, get lumped together until one side of the transaction ultimately closes the LN channel, then the final balances after all the transactions is put on the main  chain for the usual transaction fee.  So basically you do a bunch of micro transactions in a Channel, it gets closed and acts like one transaction on the main chain.

Not dissing you, I don't have the code knowledge in just idealizing,  but why could you not receive more than your channels sum? Like my second example, you put down 2 btc, I put down 1 btc, and in the end I walk out with all 3, more than I put in originally ... I'm under the impression that all the LN is , is two wallets that run the protocol between them,  therefore you can get any combination of monies that is between them...
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:02:02
I know ltc, has always been talking about adding the LN, and I know some other coins have similar promises.  
So I don't know all about coding, but how difficult would it be for bcash or other spin offs, to copy the code and create there version.  
I'm all about btc, and I get the network effect and first movers, but will copy cats easliy ride the cost tails on the code once it rolls out?
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:39:20
Also remember that these use peoples/ companies computing power to create the network,  if a new coin or clone is made, but does not have the man/computer/network power to facilitate the use of it, it is worthless,  or worth little..
 
They may work now with little use relative to btc or the larger networked coins, but if they gain traction they need new developments to keep them safe and fast.  Basically they need a good "team" or at least motivated individuals to develop them over time.

Got ya, but, your total spending capacity is 5 only at the beginning yeah?,  you could receive and spend all 15 at some point. So the receiving capacity is 10 Extra,  but the spending capacity is the total 15.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:03:07
I see what you mean... well... if you and I opened a channel we both put down 1 btc then no one could walk away with more than 2 btc seems obvious enough...  this seems logical for any amount put down between two people, even if the amounts are not equal, like you put down 2 btc and I put down 1 and in the end you leave with 3.  Never more than is actually "pre paid " by both parties combined 
Now though,  I'm not 100 percent...  but I'm pretty certain that the LN is a called a network because it links more than 2 people together, but yes, I guess you could never be paid more than what ALL the folks in the LN have "pre paid"     
But one member could have tons of btc so the cap would be huge.  I think any way :D

No it's not illegal.   
There is a difference between a wallet,  which is just some software that you download and is used to send receive, store btc.
And using an exchange account,  this is most likely how you will purchase btc or other crypto.   I think bitstamp is In the UK.  Making an account on those exchange services generally requires you to put in information like picture ID and other.   
You dont have to use an exchange service.. but you may have a hard time finding someone that has btc and would be willing to sell you some,  or trade for something.   I'm guessing that since your asking on reddit, you dont have any personal friends that are into btc. But if you find someone talk to them about it obviously .

"Bitcoin can be purchased via many channels: friends or family, Bitcoin meetups, Bitcoin ATMs, Vouchers, Localbitcoins or from any of the centralized exchanges"
That's from bisque.  
You need some btc to begin using their platform it seems.....  I'll explore it some more cause i guess it could be cool to have a decentralized place to buy btc other than local bitcoin.   There is no one else around me that has any.  Even when i shilled it at 600 and beyond, I only know like 3 people who own btc.

There have been an unusual amount of post on many crypto subreddits, some just in the last few  minutes about someone logging into a wallet they havent in a while and all of their funds being moved or vanished. 
Seems fishy,  they are different user names but still.  There are some consistenties in there posts as far as typing and style goes. 
But some of them have different amounts of info.   Some post provide pictures and details, some just very vague texts and no addresses to check.

They don't want it decentralized,  they want control of the ledger to see spending habits, they want control of who mines so who sees the ledger, who gets the new issuance of fbcoin and what those companies do with it.

There was a good post that made it to the reddit front page the other day,  it was about the traditional stock market.  But it compared 3 scenarios where someone bought and held, one situation at all the  "lowest " points after big highs,  one with buying at all the "highest" points of rallies,  and one that just bought consistently through everything.  
Guess which one won with the best overall ROI; the consistent purchases won.  Same intial investment, just different timing.  Moral is just buy some over time.

Mining is well beyond the basics. I have very little knowledge about it. And I dotn know that ATP company you mentioned,  probably not worth it.
Coinbase is a good start! at least your in.  
Download a wallet of your choosing or use a Ledger, depending on what crypto you decide.  Getting a wallet and sending it some crypto, then importing your private key into a wallet on a different computer is a really cool way to truly understand the unrelenting power that crypto is, as well as proving the importance of " your keys your crypto " 
(I like Exodus as a wallet you can download it easily,  people have hate for it because it's not open source but if you only use it for 20 bucks worth of crypto who cares; I havent had any issues and I get really good customer service when emailing them.  To get your private keys off of Exodus you need to enter developer mode, I cant remember how off the top of my head but you can Google it or just search the exodus website how. But once you have the private key you can import that into any wallet that supports the crypto you have.  Coinbase does not do this because you never have access to your private keys, only the public key.)
maybe try meta mask as a browser extension /add on. Maybe download the Brave browser. And and send your metamask address a small amount of ether.  
These are three things that really have shown me the neat aspects of crypto.   
Do all this with like 15 bucks worth of crypto.
Your son maybe asking you questions about crypto if you do these things! :)

Maybe you get some perks from mining,  as in maybe you can see the ledger and therefore people spending habits,  you can gain some personal information from that stuff. 
And if the ledger is private, and visible only to the nodes, well then a company may pay money just to view it and collect data.
Add to that, the company node gets rewarded face coin for mining, then the company can spend those coins, or attach them to special promotions "hey everyone! For a limited time only, use our app or plug in for face book, spend 5 dollars on this special game item and get 50% more bonus Facebook coin too!" 
Seems like there are a lot of things you could do as a node.  
I dont like face book, but it's a good idea. People pay money to mine bitcoin in terms of buying equipment and paying electric bills, all just in Hope's of making a profit.  Facebook could make mining very lucrative and cost effective by adjusting their "difficultly" at will since its centralized,  I assume they could mint coins at will as well.
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:27:23
I didnt mean you could just make more btc, however you can just write code that does the same thing ( yes I get the network idea so it would never be the same btc)  
So each transaction generates new code, there is still code that shows 1 btc or .05 btc, it's not that the code disappears,  the wallet interprets how to read the code and display 1 btc or whatever right?   
I understand (honestly I dont fully) that I cant make a wallet that interprets the code as 1 btc when I really only have .1 btc, or i could make the wallet say that, but the rest if the network wouldn't agree.  
However,  still why is it not possible to have the wallet interpret the .01 btc balance display as something entirely different,  maybe a green triangle or doesn't matter,  as long as when I go to send my green triangle that the rest if the network reads it as .1 btc.  
This seems like it could be useful or fun in different ways.

 I think the issue in the first example of beads is that the new force that came along didn't use beads as currency, therefore the beads in the original town became more worthless as they were flooded AND the new force used a different currency... if bitcoin is really global then the new commer is rich, buys everything and redistributes the wealth, I guess kinda like today's economy where like 1 percent own 90 percent of the wealth.  
I dont know really, though economics is tough...

down loading the receipt of your transfer, what you say when you want to download the btc blockchain, is not the same as having a paper wallet.  
a paper wallet is the private key, or in essence an account number, that you can put the key into any wallet that supports btc and then have access to the btc inside... 
the public blockchain will show you that btc coin was sent to your private ket's corresponding public key, but seeing just the public key wont allow you to access the bitcoin inside that address. 
the process that i think you want to do, is have an air gapped machine generate a private key, and therefore a public key as well, for you, then send that public key your bitcoins.  
then that private key that was generated by the air gaped machine should be as safe as you can get, so long as you never loose it / forget it.
