You'd be better off leaving your pecker on the shoulder of the trans-canada than trusting your money to ANY Canadian exchange.    
I've been stung by 3 different so-called exchanges.  Nobody in this space can be trusted, especially in Canada, where criminals run free and there is zero interest and insufficient technical expertise to investigate any crypto crime.  The space is unregulated and completely misunderstood by our justice system.  
So a big Christmas to hell with you for Smillie, Gokturk, Cotten, Dhanani / Patryn, Robertson, Hanin, Horner and all the other fast-talking confidence tricksters and their co-conspirators.  Shame on all of you for fucking over hard-working, trusting Canadians.

Amid rumors of an exit scam, their CEO passes away at 29 years of age while out of country saving orphans and holding a cheque for 26 million.  You could not make this stuff up if you tried.  Very sad news if true.  
One would think that this would have made a headline or obituary somewhere after more than a month.  It would be reassuring to see confirmation.

Now why would quadriga direct those funds back to Reyes after he was already caught with his hand in the cookie jar?  The accounts were frozen once 2.3 million was removed and put into a personal acct.  A similar amount was sold to bitcoin at a huge premium right around the time of Cottens death, his death not being announced until over a month later. By quadriga.  This wasn’t meant literally, but Reyes withdrawal of 2.3 million in user funds, the supposed 300 btc account hack, and Cottens death are poorly explained and might all be linked.
