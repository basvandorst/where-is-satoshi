What is that supposed to mean exactly?

That doesn't sound very encouraging. Would be like having your money in a bank where the banker can decide to take your funds anytime if that's more profitable than charging banking fees.

I agree with that statement.


I don't think this is correct. 
Paging Would you care giving your opinion?

I personally need to learn more about P2SH and segwit to get your points. Will certainly look into that.
I fully agree with your points regarding the hard fork. If rolling back segwit is a hard fork then it would just be only one of trivially many hard fork attacks that are possible but unfeasible.

I don't agree with your statement. If a majority of mining power arrives to a new social consensus then anything can change. The fact that this hasn't happened so far in Bitcoin does not mean that it cannot happen in the future. It certainly happened for other non trivial blockchains. So segwit can be rolled back. ...in theory. The point is what are the forces in play that will prevent that from happening.

What will prevent a majority of miners from exploiting the 'rollback attack' described in this blog post once the value of the bitcoins in anyone can spend utxos reaches billions of USD?
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:40:36
A dictionary attack.

Towards the higher end of the range.

Let's ask core developer @_date: 2017-03-10 14:32:37
@_date: 2017-03-11 13:59:07
great! :)
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:48:22
Due to segwit activation you mean?

According to the New York Agreement Bitcoin should hard fork to 2 MB blocks by the end of November. If it doesn't that would give Bcash a huge push. Will Core devs accept this compromise?

Thank you for tracking this. You are doing a socially valuable and altruistic thing.

Price will plummet initially and then recover. The Chinese market would go full over the counter and p2p which makes it all more difficult for the government to oversee and control. That's why I think this story most probably is fake.

Fat finger trader or algo trader gone wild.

"It is a distraction from the upcoming BIP148 softfork, which is **already irreversibly deployed to the network.**" How can BIP148 be irreversibly deployed when it hasn't been even merged into core yet. This guy is delusional.

Because it will never happen.
