i saw your history... and i want to tell you you run and bankrupt for kind of 6-7 losing streak ... but i want to let you ... for me i got 2 times of bankrupt 
10 losing streak on the first and i try hard avoid bankrupt but it follow by another 8 losing streak ... 
other my account got bankrupt by 8 losing streak too...
but for long play i found once 12 wining streak but because i follow my rule (rule of bankrupt... haha) i'm not put too much of bet there and it don't make any profit to fight large losing streak... 
i'm pretty sure there might some others peoples who win and who lose more than you and me ... please live on... because in the future you can work and earn more than what you lose right now... you can find another money but you can't find another life... think about who rising you here peoples who around you... if gambling is not good for you ... DON'T Play it again ... or don't play more than you can lose...

I think he (Kashing) will come again to get what he lost today...

Well ... i got 8 times today ...and go bankrupt... but for the fair ... in the simulator ... i found sometimes it going up to 13 times... ... lose 500btc for only 0.01 profit... is possible...
sometime you have to quit for a moment with a little thing you got ... i love satoshidice ... but i'm still not good at gambler...

btw ... i'm just got another 12 losing streak again.. ... i like how my heart is beating at 10+ losing streak with 50% dice...... btw bankrupt... again this is 2nd time.. of 12 losing streak for me... 
really curious how much of max losing streak ever happen to the 50% dice ?... 
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:38:25
heh 20 loss streak on 50% ? that really killer...

Martingale Strategy... great way for Bankrupt .... 
in the simulator i found it's possible of 13 lose in one short .. (For 50%)
40.96 ( Total is about 80btc ... here you LOSE if you found this and if you not start from the lowest ... that mean you will maxout .. the 500btc bet... yes nice if you won ? ... what .. if you lose ? )
and all of this to cover that 0.01 profit ... (maybe not accurate but you know what i mean... )
Martingale is nice ... if you have infinity funds and it have no max bet...

I know it's hard for you guys at MtGox to know the future attack ... 
but sure you know that from the last DDoS ? .. that you are Current TARGET ... what mean ?... next wave must have bigger... i don't know what Prolexic told you... what happen... and " What next ? " 
it's really EPIC to see this again ... and again ... and again ..how many time DDoS will own Digital Currency price ... 
I wish Gox will protect from next wave... by Prolexic or not it's not matter...

Agree it really Frightening .... because even at 50% i once bankrupt because of 12 losing streak... it will be more frightening for 13-14 losing streak....
Martingale always frightening .... for me.... it's really hard to refresh satoshidice's lookup.php ... in the last bet.

well, i bet on 50% and got 10 losing streak... and bankrupt ... after that i put some funds into the account to start again..... within 10 turns... i found another 8 losing streak and go bankrupt... again... 
it was terrible ... when found big row like 7+ ... and this is on 50% not 36%...
and after i checking via looking page... i won 38 and loses 62 .... (from 100 turns) 
in my another account i found win 12 times in a row... for 50% (but i haven't increase my bet... just looking 0.01 won... for 12 times it made me think there is possibility to reach 12 times lose too in another side of the coin.)
i use blockchain for both account ... i think i'll move to normal client and try again.
