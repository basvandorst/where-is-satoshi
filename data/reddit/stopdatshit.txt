"Bitcoin has only been around for five years, and its applications are still embryonic" - yeah, just thougt about it these days.
Still in all this 'DarkMarket' conception I can't get the logistic and shipping system - how it's gonna be different from the one on SilkRoad?
"Then there's Twister, a decentralized version of Twitter that means nothing can be blocked either by governments or the company itself" - lookin on Turkey this kind of stuff would be welcomed in some parts of the world.

WHAT IF BITCOIN IS REALLY JUST A PLOY BY THE ELECTRIC COMPANIES TO MAKE MORE MONEY?!

The Bitcoin software itself is a p2p node when it is open. Bitcoin allows incoming connections from other Bitcoin clients on the Internet, and these connections can receive and relay information about transactions and the blockchain to other clients. Good connectivity ensures that others are able to receive the blockchain quickly, and that transactions are quickly relayed.
When Bitcoin is run for the first time, it doesn't know about any other Bitcoin client IP addresses, so it connects to irc.lfnet.org (an IRC chat network with multiple servers) and listens to the  channel for the IP addresses of other users. Previously found IP addresses are then cached in the addr.dat file for faster startup in the future and for sharing with other clients. Bitcoin then connects to other p2p clients to begin downloading the past 140,000 or so Bitcoin transaction blocks. There is a backup plan, where IP addresses can be manually added to the configuration file if a user can't make the IRC connection.
However, if the inbound TCP port 8333 is blocked by a firewall or NAT box, clients won't be able to connect to you, and your Bitcoin will be limited to just 8 outbound connections (instead of 125 bidirectional connections) Therefore, port 8333 in gateways/routers/firewalls/whatever you call that Netgear box should be port-forwarded to the internal computer running Bitcoin, and provisions should be made to assure the internal computer gets a static IP assigned through DHCP or manually.
Bitcoin miners are doing something different - they are ensuring that the Bitcoin transaction blockchain is cryptographically secure. Since most are pool mining, they don't need to have the Bitcoin client open to do this.
So, although you aren't making bitcoins from doing it, leaving bitcoin software open and ensuring that it is able to make many connections to others helps all Bitcoin users.

And what you guyz need to legalize it? I mean seriously, if comparing with Colorado or where it already happened? Support in parlaments? Change the public opinion? What?

What's that? Looks like cash machine or something from fantastic movies. Like it tells you about everything going on in the house.

Oh and what the whole Cyprus school system is about? I mean what are the differences from US or other EU schools? Friend of mine is now trying to move here for couple years with his children so i'd be glad to get some info from you if it's possible.
And how is the system of bitcoin paying works? Is that ok with laws and all this stuff?

"Bitcoin &amp; Wine Only" - that would be my bar. 
But still is it too hard for cafes n other houses to become bitcoin accepting?

Still don't get law details in all these bitcoin accepting stories. Have someone faced problems about the legality? I just don't know the details of the tax legislation.

The more they ban everything the more ways if find to avoid the system
