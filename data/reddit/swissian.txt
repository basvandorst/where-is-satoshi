Go now we are on the rally

Next stop $20k and then back down to $12k to “consolidate”, or what the whales call it when they manipulate the markets to take profits and then buy back larger positions.

We do need more options for lower fee exchanges. Mega institutions like NYSE entering are a good thing. Exchange fees are the rake to use a poker term and no matter how good the game is if the rake is too high it can make the game very unprofitable.

An NYSE crypto-exchange would add stability and credibility and inject so much money into the market. This is how you get to $1million bitcoin. Regular investors don't get rich by shorting a stock. This brings them all in. It's way to hard to buy bitcoin today.

There is always going to be downward pressure as miners sell mined bitcoin to pay for their operations. So unless there are enough buyers, bitcoin will slowly go down. Now once we get all these institutional investors and new
exchanges , that's when we will likely moon.

You have to sign up on a Cryptocurrency exchange to purchase some bitcoin. You transfer fiat currency and can buy any fraction of one bitcoin there. Then you buy a hardware wallet and load the bitcoin onto the wallet. Then you put the hardware wallet in a safe place until your son is ready for his first lambo.

I agree the new Gemini fees are too high. It's embarrassing there isn't a cap. Greedy

This is just more FUD. The cost to mine bitcoin does create a floor because miners are more likely to hodl and wait for a higher price if the price is below their cost. This would then cause pressure for the price to increase.

I love cash app and i have turned many ppl on to buying tiny amounts of bitcoin on it. I just wish the fees were
transparent. Do we all get to make up the cost basis when we file taxes in the US? So annoying

Don’t hit refresh - it’s causing the price to rise too quickly!

I am scared to lose my bitcoin during the transfer process.

The hardware wallets available are too hard to use. Too many steps. Too much risk for the average retiring investors who wants to minimize it.

I really hope it stays this low so I can buy when my direct deposit hits tomorrow. Accumulate accumulate... this might end horribly but here is no way it doesn't get manipulated up to $100,000 before it does.

If I was hoping bitcoin price would be low this weekend so I could add to my hodlings, then why I am terrified bitcoin is low this weekend? Wtf emotions

I can't speak for risky tokens, but the people who frequent those places are exactly who bitcoin is for. Bitcoin will be ideal for the unbanked once we have more on and off ramps that aren't banks.

Its 3:48 am here so maybe wait a few more hours so it isn’t as late but TBH you can buy bitcoin at any time the markets never close

Reach out to the Gemini.com exchange - I have no doubt they can scale as large as you need as they verify quickly in most cases
@_date: 2019-05-20 10:07:07
True in both ways. Every dollar you don’t invest in stocks and funds doesn’t allow the greatest generation to cash out on you and leave you holding the bag.

These fees look less than the 1% they were charging? Did they go down? Definitely way more confusing then before.
