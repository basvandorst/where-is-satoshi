Me too! I love Bitwage. You will get a bank routing and account number from them. Put them in so a percentage goes to that account and BOOM magically appearing bitcoin!

Worked quite smoothly. Nicely done, however we must bring in the blocksize debate into this thread... oh good, the comment above just did. whew!

Excellent! I use Mycelium on iOS and like it quite well.  I can confirm the issues jeroenv8 has had. Still... I like it better than most others.

Where is that ATM? I only found the Mike Tyson ATM.
 That one was much harder than expected for me to find. It is inside the Off The Strip Pub on the LINQ Promenade.

Thanks! I'll bookmark your site. Wish I would have seen your site earlier. I spent 2 hours walking around casinos and shops getting odd looks asking, "Hey, do you know where the Mike Tyson bitcoin ATM is?" Although, it was fun explaining what... why... who...

They are flexible but only in multiples of .0001 BTC. Quickly gauging the value of .0003 BTC compared to .0001 BTC is the realm of us bitcoiners not the public. Even still, not flexible enough.

I have downloaded and tried so many and have not found any. Do  you know the name of one?

Same thing happens to me. Sometimes on every transaction. I just figured that was the new normal now. iPhone6, iOS 9.3

I'm in! I would spin my node back up if this were available.

True, once everything is denominated in bitcoin ALL should be in bitcoin. For now the choice should the users, easier to decide value, easier to understand value.

I've used it a few times and have no real problems. Once in a while items are shipped from China and take longer than we are used to in the US.
One time the person never ended up shipping the item. Purse just refunded the bitcoin and I reordered.
Since Gamestop carries gas cards (in the US) you can get a good percentage off gas cards (25%) by buying gamestop cards from Purse then taking them to Gamestop and buying BP or Amaco cards. Interesting idea..

I keep 5 or so in my wallet all the time. Mostly $2 tips. I have stopped helping people redeem them. If you help them, they don't have as much time and thought investment in bitcoin. They won't appreciate the tip.
I usually give them to people that are genuinely curious in bitcoin and have some technical skills... even with those two criteria only 20% ever redeem them. The admin page also shows how many times the page was visited. I have to admit, I feel a little disappointed in people that do not even visit the page once... 
Since these are your employees... and you will most likely give them more than $2. You will have a lot more engagement.

1 Use bctip.org
2 Keep track of the tip numbers
3 If they don't redeem them you get the bitcoin back
4 You will know and you can reissue, give them some asstance, or give them something else they value more.
Many of the bitcoin I have given out previous to finding bctip.org were never used and they lost their private keys. Gone forever.

Me too. The Shift card has been great. sad.

Most successful Bitcoin sanctuary I have heard of so far. Sent a tip your way.

"I clicked on "load different wallet" (out of curiosity! just wanted to see what happens) and..."
This happened to me as well. The idea of clicking one button and having it drop the credentials is dangerous, IMHO. I lost only a few dollars. It could have been much worse.
Many wallets support multiple "wallet accounts" so I didn't think much of the option to "load a different wallet". There should be at least a warning saying the credentials will be discarded.
Hive is the only Bitcoin wallet I have lost money with so far. I have loaded 20+ iOS/Android wallets and several web wallets. I cannot recommend Hive for Bitcoin until something is done with this issue.

I am completely surprised by the cost as well. I would be happy to pay $.50 to $1 to watch a speech from a BTC Conference. $10 is way too high.

There are 48 bitcoin addresses with over $10 Million dollars in them. If  you can prove bitcoin is not secure you can have $480 Million. Anonymously. Today.
Here is the list:

Tokenly is working on a system to do something similar. Adam B. Lavine has put in a lot of thought on this and is building a platform to facilitate it:

How about I give you $2 in bitcoin for free. Just comment with your wallet address.
@_date: 2015-09-05 15:36:35
ok, just sent it. Even a little is great for showing people it's potential. See the transaction here:

Auto updates from coinmarketcap.com for bitcoin as well as the top 15 (or so) altcoins. I bet there are better versions out there.

Bitwage.com can mostly likely handle this situation. When you create an account they give you a routing and account numbers. For almost any situation that will do direct deposits this will work.
Example: I drive for Uber periodically and all of they money they pay me each week goes into bitwage and shows up in my wallet. I can even split by percentage to multiple wallets. 
It's worth a try anyway.

I am a big fan of bitwage.com I receive 3% of my paycheck directly in bitcoin. Show right up in my bitcoin wallet. This is the easiest way to get bitcoin.
They give you a bank account and routing number and you enter it in your employer's payroll system. Your  employer does not even need to know.
Also, with billpayforcoins.com you can pay any of your standard bills with bitcoin. I can't really endorse it yet, I have not actually paid anyone up to this point. The idea is great though.

xcoinx.com is listed on OneCoin.eu as the crypto exchange of choice. Have them go to that site. Complete garbage. xcoinx lists OneCoin as the 2nd biggest with a $5B market cap, just under Bitcoin.
Then go to CoinCap.io. They list every damn crypto available including  "CRTCoin CRT" with a total market cap of $66. If OneCoin was legit... why would CoinCap not list it.
