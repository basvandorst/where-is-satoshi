It's funny you can talk shit but delete your posts when you get called out.

If they're trying to spread this idea or get people motivated about the idea of traveling to mars, taking their money should not have been a thing. We live in the age of the internet, you can spread ideas and visions for free with the entire world.

Because people like you are making it that way.

Too many bullshit patents still make it through the system though.

It is, people need to watch more defcon videos. It's one thing on hating on the irony here, but the people here laughing about "everything is hackable" really don't understand how bad it is right now.

Still, nobody besides an executive should know how to access the wallets used in production. Developers can use separate wallets for testing if needed.

You took that wayyyy out of context. The comic depicts that the cloud suddenly just breaks and everyone gets fucked. I pointed out the uptime to show the cloud does not just 'break'.

They all have multiple nines but I couldn't find the exact amount of them

Instead of showing me an IBM sales page can you explain why Bitstamp shouldn't be using the cloud? Cause the comic was bullshit.
 "The cloud stopped working", AWS, DigitalOcean, etc all have approx. 99.9% uptime. Clouds don't just 'break'. Moreover, any private cloud could also break. The difference is because you own the hardware, it's now either your job to fix it or you already pay a lot more money for the technicians in the data center to maintain your systems.

Employee's could access user wallets? That's scary and a red flag waving uncontrollably. Where did you hear this?

I think you're the only one here with a mental disorder.
