OP, Step2theJep doesn't much care about where the bitocin market is going, or at least that is not his main goal. 
He is here to shill his own videos. That is his video. HE is likely John Le bonn and he wants you to be a member of his website for the low low price of 5$/ week, or $260/week.
He spams conspiracy reddits and cryptocurrency sites with his videos but has been soft banned from pulling this shit at r/conspiracy so he is here. Check his post history, check his comment history, check his user history... he is here to spread his spam...
His previous post accused bitcoin of being a freemason conspiracy...

It is his podcast, he is likely John Le Bon.
He comes here and r/conspiracy to shill his videos which then promote his 5$/week or $260 per year website where he call himself the world's greatest skeptic. 
He was not getting traction with his attempts to recruit followers here so he spams cryptocurrency sites. He has a soft ban over at r/conspiracy from shilling his content although he still tries. 
Check his post and comment history. He is not acting in good faith and there is something wrong with him in general.
