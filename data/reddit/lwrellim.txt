That's really all that the "merchant" side ever was.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:43:15


Saying it is a 2% compliance borders on a major misrepresentation of the data.
The 2% is  crudely averaged percentage of the NUMBER of income tax filer's who list an applicable "use" tax amount -- it is not representative of the AMOUNT owed (i.e. states are NOT "missing" 98% of the use tax dollars they are legally due).
Many people may factually have made $0 of purchases that "use" taxes are due on -- not everyone lives near and cross state borders to make purchases that are billed sans sales tax, and there are many people who *still* don't buy anything online or via mail-order.
And many more people who do buy online... probably only make such a small dollar total of such purchases that the use tax due is trivial (probably less than the cost of mailing them an "enforcement" letter).
Keep in mind that there's more than a bit of a difference between someone who bought $50 worth of something on Amazon, and a business that regularly buys thousands of dollars worth of office supplies from out of state vendors, or someone who bought a $100,000 yacht or other luxury good w/o paying sales tax.
The vast majority of the population is -- generally speaking -- not in the latter two groups (hell they don't have the income to be).
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:52:37
The point remains inane.  It's akin to claiming that people are violating the law by not charging sales tax at rummage sales. The amounts would be trivial and not worth the cost of processing, much less enforcement.

Actually most businesses DO comply and self-report "use" taxes.
So do individuals who make LARGE out of state purchases (and if they don't this is one of the things that can end up hurting them -- penalties PLUS interest -- on state income tax audits).

IMO, their "risk" is closely related to how long they hold/hoard. If (IMO when) they "cash out" it -- unless it HAS truly become a "currency" in widespread use -- then that fact alone will be fairly solid evidence that the thing was USED as (if not intended/designed to be) a pyramid/confidence scam.

Actually, a LOT of the internet "stocks" pretty much WERE scams.


Dunno.  I've missed a lot of things that were touted as "revolutions"... but which I knew were con operations ... and virtually all of them ended up being revealed as or becoming scams that a LOT of people lost a LOT of money on.
Whether this one is an *intentional* scam or not... currently it is nothing but a speculative bubble.
And as such, TPTB could easily demolish it at any time they want to.  (The Fed could easily use various agents to buy up a sizeable chunk of BitCoin -- in exchange for monopoly $$ they can create from thin air at the touch of a keystroke {and so not give a damn if it is lost} -- and then use that chunk to "tank" the market in the aftermath of any adverse news {which could simply be an IRS/SEC/DEA or other gov reg. "announcement" regarding bitcoin} -- herd "panic" behavior would take care of the rest in fairly short order.)
This idea that the Fed and US government agencies will sit idly by and let a new currency develop that could replace the dollar is utterly naive.
Among other things... all these kiddo's are thinking they have gained "big wealth" in bitcoin appreciation ... and are entirely ignorant or forgetful of the fact that -- if nothing else -- the IRS can (and probably will) ding them for capital gains. That alone would cause a lot of "Oh Shit!" brown-pants days.

And what exactly do you think the porn vendors will do with their bitcoins... buy Alpaca Wool Socks?
@_date: 2011-06-10 14:25:58


Exactly. And this will NOT happen.
Why?  Because there is NO positive incentive for MAJOR merchants to join up; and there are a HOST of *VERY negative* incentives to make them continue to avoid it.  The MAJOR merchants are all part of the existing establishment -- they have already optimized themselves in a form of "collusion" with the established currencies and governments (yes there is some back-and-forth volatility, but it is relatively minor, and often VERY subject to their influence via lobbyists, etc).
The people BitCoin appeals to are all MARGINAL players (and currently it is mostly speculators trying to "get in early" and reap a quick reward before cashing out and leaving the greater fools as a bunch of bagholders).
@_date: 2011-06-09 15:56:50
Like all pyramid schemes, at some point\* the founders/early-adopters WILL cash out (known as "FU money").
Shortly thereafter the whole thing will likely come crashing down.
\*I also have no doubt that the founders (like any pump &amp; dump operation) have pre-calculated certain price points at which they intend to cash out portions of their holdings. (Because seriously, if you are holding say even just 1,000 bitcoins ... at a price of $100 that will be a cool $1 million.  Some will, of course, be greedier and hold on longer... the vast majority will have gotten in *too late* and will also be to greedy and will wait *too long* to cash out.)
It will be fun to watch all of this play out (just as it is "fun" to watch any [penny-stock pump &amp; dump]( play out -- just replace "stock" with "bitcoin").

Except Bitcoin -- which WAS designed (via the logarithmic decline in the "mining") to operate AS a pyramid scheme... regardless of whether it EVER turns out to function (however temporarily) as a currency.  Seems to me the founders discovered a was a way to do a tech-stock pump &amp; dump while (technically) avoiding ALL of the standard securities laws.  
Something tells me that (even as BitCoin fails massively) they will either get away with it (and become immensely rich ... sometimes pump &amp; dumpers DO manage to weasel their way free) -- OR -- they will pay a really hefty price.

You really don't have much experience with trading do you? 
And the answer to your question is YES... 5% is more than enough to trigger herd "stampede" behavior (and then add to it the fact that the 5% is significantly MORE than 5% of the "float" with 2/3 of bitcoin almost never seeing the light of day,that means the 5% is equivalent to +15% of the float).

You are really politically naive, aren't you.
The banksters were "rescued" because the banksters are needed to collude in the continued debt financing of the government.

@_date: 2011-06-10 11:25:29


Isn't it rather obvious?


Whatever makes you think their reason has to be "legitimate"in the eyes of anyone but themselves?
It should be fairly obvious that they specifically designed in this "feature" in order to *inordinately* reward the founders, and then to a lesser extent to reward "early adopters". *IOW, to emulate things like MLM and/or pyramid schemes.*
I also think the system is destined to fail prematurely (i.e.  long before the full amount has been "mined") from a technical/scalability standpoint. Now whether that was deliberate (i.e. by design) or an unintended miscalculation on the part of the coders remains to be seen. (But does anyone seriously think the same guys who came up with the crypto and maths involved ALSO made a "miscalculation" on the computing power needed... seriously?)
@_date: 2011-06-09 16:40:50


BINGO.  Whether it was the original intention or not, bitcoin is currently ONLY a "pump &amp; dump" speculation opportunity.  If it survives the eventual "dump" stage (which I highly doubt, because the "dump" stage will {hugely} reward only a small number of people, and will burn a LARGE number of people) ... the most important negative consequence of which will be the "burning" of any and all merchants who are the late-game adopters (or at least those who DON'T immediately "convert" any/all BTC sales to real currencies).

The "meat" is near the end...

@_date: 2011-06-10 19:02:36
The "concept" maybe.  The execution... not so much.
Among other things, on a planet of 6+ *billion* people, to establish a currency with an arbitrary limit 21 million "units" and then force everything to be fractional (infinitesimal) subunits from there... to me is an indicator that they either never REALLY intended it to reach "currency" status, OR they intended to become EXTREMELY wealthy somewhere along the way (whether it succeeds or fails).
Because spread "evenly" across the world population, each individual would have ~0.003 bitcoins -- giving anyone holding a single block of 50 bitcoins the wealth of around ~15,000 such *average* individuals (and of course far more with an uneven distribution).  And with the largest current single "wallet" containing nearly 300,000 bitcoins being the equivalent of more than double the population of the US. (And even at current valuation, that single wallet is around $8 million -- it is doubtless that the holder of that wallet is one of the founders/early adopters, "hoarding" rather than distributing this supposed "currency" -- ergo it someone playing the pyramiding effect.)
**And the HALLMARK of a "scam" is in the fact that the system is designed to make the founders significantly wealthy even DESPITE the general failure of the enterprise.**

*

Not necessarily. First of all the whole thing was a "gamble".  It certainly wasn't very "risky" in terms of computing time (not initially) the first hashes/nonce blocks were literal "freebies". (The first "difficulty" iteration level of 2016 blocks -- doubtless generated by the founder(s) -- rewarded them with 100,000 BTC, "worthless" at first but at current "bubble/speculation" pricing, worth over $3 million.)
They doubtless assumed that SOME speculation would occur, but the rate at which it "bubbled" was hardly guaranteed.  If they expected it would peak at say $1 or $10, then it would be necessary to hold onto *millions* of the initial BTC in order to garner any "big" win to the gamble. Add in the fact that they were doubtless aware of several significant facts: 1) That it was fairly irrelevant to the initial early "market" whether they withheld 0.2% or 1% or 50% -- the "value" of anything is it's *presumed* scarcity. 2) That there MUST be some type of "enforced" (i.e. artificially created) scarcity\*. and 3) That only once a sizable "market demand" (speculative or otherwise) could they hope to "Cash Out".
\* Regarding that scarcity -- you have noted that they COULD have done it in a more "linear" fashion; I would note that if it were REALLY intended as a **currency**, it should ideally follow a slow-growth "S" curve instead which would ramp up (ideally linked via some mechanism to number of \**vendors accepting the coins in trade for goods/services and entirely *discounting/not-counting* currency exchanges), and then tip back to plateau and eventually flatten as it gained (truly) widespread use. THAT would have taken care of creating an "artificial" scarcity, BUT it would have also PREVENTED them from being able to hold large blocks themselves.
\**This could be done via the VENDORS having to provide the computing power to resolve the hashes, and not having any "miners" at all. (But of course THAT would have required that the founders themselves PRODUCE something of significant/wide value -- which was apparently NOT something they were capable of -- they wanted to put themselves in the position of a central bank/bankster/government and gain inordinate benefits... not that of being just another "grubbing" business equal to others.)


Only if they cash out at the right time, and in the right way. 


If history and human behavior are any guide, the founder(s)/early adopter(s) face a collective "prisoner's dilemma" and it is very likely that some one or another of them will "pull the trigger" and "dump" in a substantially larger way than the others anticipate seeking to get out "while the getting is good" and will end up tanking the market.
This also leads to another "devil's advocate" possibility that I think the founders have not anticipated... some entity with easy access to endless EXISTING currencies (say the Fed or one/many of its minions) could easily have "bought in" in a substantial enough way, boosting the prices to bubble highs and then (whenever they desire) DUMPING them at a loss in order to destroy the market value. 
Consider that the current total count of BitCoins is less than 6.5 million, and even at $30 each, that represents less than $200 million -- peanuts to an entity like the Federal Reserve {especially considering that they can create endless amounts of $ by simply pushing digits into an account} -- and then add in that to "TANK" any market and trigger a panic sell-off you typically only need to control and "dump" *less than 10%* of the total (and even less if the "float" is so fractional as it appears to be with BitCoin).
And if you doubt that one can "tank" a market with such a small percentage ... just look at housing.  Historically approximately 30%~40% of American homes are owned "free-and-clear" (i.e. no mortgage at all). Only the remaining 60%~70% carry any mortgage at all, and traditionally about 1/2 those are [mid-way (or further) through their mortgage terms]( with the resident/owner holding somewhere around or above 50% of the equity and where the majority of their standard payment is no longer paying loan interest, but paying down against the principal (rapidly accelerating their equity).
All that REALLY happened in the market was that the demand "dried up" because banks were no longer willing to make the 0% down LTV loans. THAT immediately destroyed the market for the "house flippers" (who were a tiny percentage, and many of whom were in/out then in and out again and again -- the key to flipping being to play "hot potato" and NOT to be stuck "holding the bag" when the music stopped), who immediately defaulted (many of them never EVER making a payment at all, even DURING the bubble rise). Some of those houses (maybe 1%, 2% ?) were then "dumped" back on the market -- and as [house pricing never really plateaued, rather it peaked and then PLUNGED]( accelerating at several stages on the way down just as it did on the way up -- as additional "types" of speculators decided to strategically default, sell short, or otherwise get out while the getting was still either "good" or at least "not so bad".


Right now the vast majority of people with BitCoins ARE "holding" them.  They are NOT spending them. They are SPECULATING (and if anything are counting it as a "wealth effect" and are probably spending a larger share of the $$ monies, and HOLDING their BitCoin -- cf [Gresham's Law]( which is an *observational* "law" of human herd behavior).


Ah, but you CAN "dump" portions of your holdings... as long as you do it incrementally, AND you feed it **INTO** the speculative bubble-rises (which can be mapped fairly simply to follow along after various PR blitzes).
I highly doubt the things will get anywhere NEAR $3,000.  It will grow FAR too tempting to the founder(s) and early-adopter(s) and anyone else holding large chunks. Even at $30, someone holding 100,000 would have a valuation of $3 billion. They undoubtedly WILL begin "feeding" some of that into any rises, either at $30, or at $50, and even moreso if it ever broaches $100.
And keep in mind that the current demand is emphatically **NOT** that the things are being used as "currency" in actual business trade (not even drugs, and certainly not "alpaca socks" or BitCoin T-Shirts and Bumper Stickers) -- no, the VAST majority of the recent rise is all SPECULATIVE.
I would not be at all surprised if MUCH of the current "rise" is not in fact the Fed (and/or via it's minions) shoveling a few million in with the full-blown intention of being able to destroy the market with a flood on the heals of some regulatory action (i.e. a one-two punch; with any "news" release of some charge/indictment or other legal action causing BitCoin holders to become "antsy" and very "anxious" -- and then getting them to PANIC by "dumping" a few hundred thousand BitCoins in a matter of hours -- if the price dropped from $30 down to $15 in a day, herd behavior would set in and it would/will probably drop to $5 and even further in the following days).
Because the goal of any entity like the Fed would be to DESTROY BitCoin... and they really wouldn't care one damned bit if they had to lose a few million to accomplish it. (After all to the Fed, dollars are just Monopoly-like "play" money which they can create out of nothing. They created *trillions* in order to "save" the banking industry... does anyone REALLY think they wouldn't be willing to lose a few million {or even a billion} to destroy a potentially competing currency?  To me the "BitCoin fanbois" who think the government cannot destroy their "currency" are ridiculously naive, like little children playing around with toy guns on a real battlefield.)

They have provided a wide variety of rationalizations. And IMO, most of them ARE fairly "thin" (which is one reason I think the whole thing will implode).


You presume that they WEREN'T overly "greedy". Why?


The situation is not much different than the "founder's stock" in any tech company.  Even if they were allowed to (i.e. ignoring SEC regulations) most founders cannot *practically* sell their entire stock holdings without "tanking" the stock itself.


Yes but in order to build a "base" there would still need to be *some* significant incentive in place to get the early adopters to devote resources and to "push" the whole thing along -- many aspects of which are of highly dubious legality. (In addition to the founders, most of the people pushing BitCoin {such as here on Reddit for instance} would be in total, blatant, *flagrant* violation of a whole host of SEC regulations, as well as many Federal and State laws in the US {not te mention various other countries} were they pushing a "stock" or any other "security". And indeed, BitCoins *may* very well be labeled as such by a court and/or regulatory agency, especially considering that inordinate "gains" {via the "deflation" effect} have been repeatedly and rather loudly proclaimed as part of the "promotion".)

But remember, just about ANY story can function as the "Kool-Aid" for a pump &amp; dump operation -- the only requirement is that the story be deemed "plausible" by the suckers being sold the proverbial bill of goods. In this instance libertarian and anarchist type techie-geeks initially sold via the "crypto-goodness" and then with the (current) speculative "pumping" are all gaga over it... eventually (unless they cash out at a MAJOR profit point) as the "dump" stage &amp; the aftermath happens they will go into the "betrayed" and "conspiracy" mode.

That ought to be the definition of insanity (or stupidity).

Probably.  Generally speaking any/all "warning" comments I posted on bitcoin were downvoted into oblivion.
I suppose you could say **that I** am possibly an interesting psychological question as well.  I mean I post sincere, solid critiques and give serious warnings, even though I *know* in advance that no one will listen and that they will be downvoted.
So why do I bother?  
Is it to alleviate some sense of "guilt" I perhaps feel at getting an "easy money" profit from this kind of thing?  I mean it's NOT ME who set up the scheme/scam, I'M not running any of the servers or exchanges, I'M not posting any "pumping" threads or comments or anything of that kind at all (seriously, I don't) -- *I'm actually WARNING PEOPLE* and as **seriously as I possible can** with charts, data, etc about what a trap/scam the whole thing is.
I mean am I really still to blame if they stupidly bludgeon ahead with it anyway and buy in well after the point that they should NOT do so (because the gains they could get -- if any -- will be trivial)???


Yeah, people get caught up in abstract nihilistic semantic arguments over "inherent" and "intrinsic" -- it really comes down to something simple: if you turn up the literal heat on the object, what will you end up with?  
Gold &amp; silver coin, even copper &amp; other base metal coins... well they MELT... and then re-solidify when the heat is removed. For all intents and purposes, nothing is lost, none of the metal "vaporizes".. it doesn't go "poof" into smoke or crumble into ashes; all that happens is that it's shape and surface (superficial) aspects change... that's it.  THAT is what "inherent/intrinsic" means.  A one ounce gold coin melts and turns into... a one ounce gold *some other shape* thing that probably still even *looks* like a shiny gold round coin, just a different one.  Same thing with a (real) silver coin, or a (real) copper one, etc.
Now... what happens to a piece of paper currency?  A stock certificate (provided you even GOT one)?  Subject them to literal physical or *proverbial* "heat"... and you get ashes &amp; smoke... not useful for anything (well I suppose the carbon has some trivial value when added to dirt in a garden).
So inherent/intrinsic really means something in the literal physical world -- forget the nihilistic relativistic philosophical bullshit -- intrinsic means that if/when the SHTF and the heat and pressure are on will the damnable thing survive a "change in form".  If/when the government dies or the bank dies, or the network croaks... will the damned things disappear along with it? Or will some actual "substance" remain.
**Now that doesn't mean that thinks like paper currencies, paper stocks and bonds, paper contracts, or digital, "virtual" things don't have ANY value or use...**  I mean DUH, reddit is all digital/virtual, does it have value or use? Of course.  But... what if the reddit servers crash?  And the owners decide to NOT waste their time rebuilding it. (Or what if, like Digg, they decide to implement a new version that sinks the entire thing?  Well then the imputed confidence-only-based value in the digital/virtual can go "poof".  Ergo there is nothing inherent or intrinsic about it. Not even popularity counts.)


I think the threat of it being used for money-laundering and tax-avoidance is what will eventually/inevitably cause a crackdown and confiscation (again, ala Kim Dotcom &amp; MegaDownload -- keep in mind THAT was over "copyright" which is only a dubious crime at best and not a "threat" to taxation or government financing systems).
I mean remember, they have now succeeded in forcing Switzerland to allow the "breaching" of the previously immune "numbered Swiss bank account" -- if they're going to do that, do you REALLY think that some "geeks" with servers stand a chance? Hell, they can just force the internet connections to a building or an ISP, or if necessary an entire region or even country to be "shut down" or "cut off".  As "virtual" as the web &amp; internet are they still have to run on physical machinery connected to a physical network.


It is a well-aimed con-operation scheme.  And the MLM aspects definitely play an important part in that.


Ah, see I don't think they did.  I think they bought in early enough and were probably one of the big sellers that cashed out near the peak -- I'd bet they actually made a pretty decent (actual) coin off of it, and will buy back in a few months down the road.
I also think its interesting and wonder if -- for all their claims to be "innovators" and computer/web entrepreneurs -- whether this is the BEST thing they could find to sink a major amount of cash into.

Note that I am not the one who "set" some $200 (actually $190) price point... that was noted by an early hoarder as the price point above which he was determined to "cash out" in a major way (i.e. *"getting while the getting is good"* so to speak).
And the second section was noting that an early "miner" was purposefully sitting on a sizable "pile", and that doubtless he too would choose to "cash out" a portion of that when he felt some peak had been reached (which in conjunction with other similar hoarders -- would effectively be the "prick" that would burst the bubble).


Well of course it did.  Unwelcome news is, not surprisingly ... unwelcome.

Actually, it has "crashed" several times before. (Most of the earlier speculative pump &amp; dump crashes were at such low values {but still many multiples of the prior value} that they are not readily discernible on the graphs, especially the ones charting the value on linear scales.)
It seems to follow regular "pump &amp; dump" cycles with relatively low "use" intervals enduring about 18 months or so, then another p&amp;d bubble happens (each one larger than the last, and undoubtedly with early adopter/miners -- along with speculators -- "cashing out" at certain peak values, leaving a lot of bag holders).
You see the same thing happen with various penny stocks (and bitcoin has become just one more of the "penny stock newsletter" p&amp;d things, as they join the "pumping" bandwagon).

Personally I think one should think of bitcoin as "gambling" and "fire" rather than as a "currency".
And by "fire" I mean you are "playing with fire" -- for example, what portion of your net worth are you going to lay out on a proverbial "picnic table" in a park as flammable $100 bills underneath an oil lamp?
Keep in mind there are a LOT of other people playing in the park, any one of whom could stumble and shift your picnic table, or toss a ball and tip over that lamp, etc.

It isn't.
And despite the claims, Bitcoin really ISN'T primarily a "currency" -- it's a speculative thing based on the idea that it might **become** a "currency".


BINGO.  It ruins the sales pitch.
*BTW, conversely preaching the "buy &amp; hold" is part and parcel with the speculative thing -- the more people engage in that "hoarding", the smaller the float is -- and subsequently the more likely another "spike" will occur when the next round of "newbies" become aware of and buy into the scheme (which of course has a self-feedback mechanism that removes supply and increases price, etc).*  Generally speaking a lot of the people who preach the "Buy &amp; Hold" the loudest will in fact NOT be doing that themselves... instead they will be SELLING at the highs, and then coming back and BUYING in again at the later plateau-lows... it's pretty amazing how a series of 5x or 10x increases can change even a small amount of money into a large one. (Of course this is NOT a "victimless" thing... it is really just a means of transferring money from the people who buy at the peak to the people who are selling at that point.)
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:35:07


Meh, maybe.  Regardless I don't like risking too much of my asset base on these kinds of schemes -- I toss in a bit on one here or there, but more for the "intellectual" and entertainment value than anything else. 
(BTW I've done fairly well at casinos with blackjack too, but I try to severely limit that... there is an inherent "trap" in all this kind of stuff.  The allure of "easy money" can be as addicting, if not more addicting than a drug like Heroin, and IMO is potentially just as life-destroying; people are forever searching for the next BIG "win", and invariably/inevitably they risk more and more and eventually lose their arse -- I'm a lot more conservative than that; and my needs/wants are relatively small.)
Besides, IMHO, there's really no rush. The dead cat will be flopping around for a couple of months yet before the whole thing bottoms.
And I do have what I think are valid concerns regarding a couple potential problems:
* One is the possibility of a Kim Dotcom style "seizure" of MtGox servers, that kind of thing -- or even the threat of it via a PR release or a "leak" by say FBI or Treasury -- well, it could happen *at any time* during some runup/buildup phase in one of these cycles, and I think it would be sufficient to "snuff" a cycle early (which is the time you want to buy in, so you could potentially face a large loss, indeed it is entirely possible for this thing to collapse into nothing, for the major servers to "fork" over to some copycat system, etc)... or for something of that type to pop a bubble prior to it's natural bursting point (i.e. before one has a chance to take any gains).
* The other is something that has already happened a few times -- and that is a hack/software glitch that creates a "fork", or a flash crash -- the recent (circa mid-March) 0.8.0 thing, and the prior hacks.  Again while these have generally been only short term problems, there is the potential for one of them to get out of hand... and as the bubble-cycle iterations grow larger, well, the stakes grow bigger too (which means hacking efforts become substantially more attractive and potentially lucrative).
* Finally, the size of the blockchain. It grew exponentially HUGE with this latest iteration -- any subsequent cycle will potentially lead to an even greater exponential increase -- and a logical/bandwidth limitation based implosion... and again the timing of that is a chaotically unpredictable thing.


I'm not going to bother digging back through my posting history here, but suffice it to say that I have written clear "warnings" about this (which like the April 2 posting were ignored/downvoted) during the past several month (and indeed back before and during the last cycle) -- but virtually no one ever listens to or believes people who sound like Cassandra you know.
That too is an interesting human behavior pattern.

Probably when it drops to around $17... give it a week or two.

Sure. But then when it crashes, and the newbie's "panic", or the previous holders decide to sell while the price is still relatively high (and anticipate buying back in at a lower figure later)... the "split" gets reaggregated again.


Not really. Because as the value goes up, while there may be more total PEOPLE who are "holding", they are generally (on an individual basis) holding smaller and smaller fractions of the total bitcoins out there.
Plus... those who decide to "buy &amp; hold" for the long term (i.e. longer term speculation) are subtracting from the "float" that available for either use in commerce or for purchase.
 
IOW the total "float" is *not* necessarily growing (and it certainly isn't growing as quickly as the so called "adoption" curve -- hence the spikes -- and keep in mind here by "adoption" we do NOT mean people who are actually using it AS A CURRENCY, because the fraction of bitcoins that are being used that way is a trivial subfraction of the float.)

Actually in many states it would not be. There are such things as title filing fees, and real estate transfer taxes; and with a few "loophole" exceptions (cases of widows, actual auctions, etc) in many states there are laws regarding the transfer of title for what are deemed "inordinately low" amounts or transfers made without determining a specific dollar value (i.e. your single jellybean) whereby the state will use their own previously determined "fair market assessed value" for the calculation of the tax owed.
Not to mention, having become aware of your "jelly bean" antics, they will probably be flagging your state income taxes (and/or alerting the IRS regarding your federal income taxes) for some, shall we say "special scrutiny" in regards to your "windfall asset value receipts" (which are then subject to tax, either cap gains or as normal income).
Other people have tried similar shenanigans: if/when the things and amounts/values of objects they are trading are trivial, the state doesn't seem to care (not worth the bother basically), but if they become large (in dollar terms of the value of the trade), they tend to think it is worth the bother.
IOW (and this seems to be one of Denninger's main points) if/when bitcoin *actually* begins to be used for substantial real world economic activity... the government will become EXTREMELY interested.

From my understanding this WAS the "third round" (the first one was about 3 years ago, and was so small it really didn't appear on many people's radar screens... hence the second one, which while larger and even hitting the media in a small way, still was a bit "under the radar"... which of course was what allowed for the recent third iteration, the semi-plausible "Cyprus" story probably helped, even though there is no evidence that {relative to bitcoin} it was anything other than a story-myth BS sales pitch that went viral).
As far as whether there can be yet another iteration...  Yes I think there can be, despite what you might think, this really DIDN'T hit the mainstream in a super large way, and the vast majority of the population is still ignorant of it, even significant segments (possibly the majority) of the "techie" subpopulation is only *vaguely* aware of it. Over time -- say a year or more -- and the stories/myths of the guys who got (or claim to have gotten "rich") will grow, and meanwhile the people who got burned and lost a few hundred (or even a few grand) will be downplayed and/or forgotten (and not a few will end up being "bagholders" who refused to cut their losses, follow the thing down into the teens or 20's in terms of nominal price... and who will be "itching to ditch" in the next runup... they'll be the people who will lurk around waiting to pitch in and do their part with the viral "pumping" when the next round happens; hoping to at least get their original money back and possibly make some profit from it as well).
And then of course there are the BIG bag-holders (like the Winlevii) who will bide their time and, having so much to gain from some later (and hopefully larger) subsequent pump &amp; dump runup... will eventually pull some strings, maybe even pay some people to start spamming forums again in 6 months or so and attempt to create another "grassroots" (i.e. astroturf) groundswell of interest that can support a subsequent runup.
Realistically this is NOT some "new" thing -- there is a whole tried and true "science/art/method" behind the psychology of the apparent "madness" underlying pump &amp; dump schemes -- lots of penny-stock newsletters have the system down pat, and bounce from one such meme to another (and when something like bitcoin comes along, they too can often jump in -- with their subscriber base giving an instant timely-boost to the price runup).

Do the math already... *think* for a minute.


It has no validity as a currency whatsoever. (Doesn't mean you can't make some bank off of it... just beware of the "falling knives"; and try not to become a "bag holder".)


Who says the point was to actually create a currency?
Just because that is what the proposal *claimed* does not mean that was what it was all about.
"Satoshi Nakamoto" can easily be translated to "Charles Ponzi".
BTW, if you haven't yet done so, you need to SERIOUSLY (and THOROUGHLY) [read through the detailed analysis (PDF)]( that was done back in 2012 -- or at a minimum, read through [the "summary" that was done on ArsTechnica]( shortly afterwards.

Yeah, most people I know claim I am "interesting" and/or "fascinating" (hell since the beard went gray [I'm actually starting to **physically** resemble this dude]( scary!) -- all rather neutral/ambiguous semi-complimentary-insults -- their opinions of me wax from "astounded/amazed" to the waning "dude you're nuts" and then back again. 
* Per example I bought my house pre-bubble when mortgage interest rates were insanely high +8% APR (because when rates are high, prices are low, by definition) -- and then paid the damn thing off so fast (8 years total, it could have been 6 years, but I slacked off at the end) that, well, even though I **had** planned to take advantage of dropping rates... it wasn't worthwhile refinancing (I know I checked into it every year, ran the numbers and it was never better than a "wash" no matter how much the rates dropped, because I kept paying the principal down so fast).
* Then, I called the housing bubble early (circa 2003, figured it would peak in around 2006) and tried to warn several friends who had made BIG money selling places that they should sit tight, rent and wait for the crash... but they didn't listen so they bought in AGAIN (and ended up underwater, either locked in or losing everything they *thought* they had gained)...  
* Then I told friends to GET OUT!!! of the stock market in October 2007, and when they didn't listen to that -- well that they had a second chance to get out in early 2008 (Feb/Mar) ... but they all said I was "crazy" and that the market was going to come back and go higher... well I wasn't crazy at all.
* And note that while during the summer of 2008 they were all saying I was a "wizard" with amazing prescient talents, well... they STILL thought me "crazy" all over again to buy back in late in 2008 and early 2009 (and they didn't follow... which I suppose was understandable, I mean what were they going to buy back in WITH?).  Now some of what I bought was really STUPID and RISKY (Lehman, WaMu -- lost everything I invested; I would have sworn that at least ONE of those two was going to bounce back/win in court, etc) -- but other ones (Dollar Thrifty-- i.e. DTG back then, DTGF for ref as Hertz bought them out) more than made up for it, even if I didn't quite get in at the bottom and exited well before the top.
Now, my "risky" bets are relatively small -- and I'm not a multi-millionaire (quite frankly I don't WANT to be one... makes you too damned much of a target &amp; too many hassles with people for my tastes) -- but I'm fairly comfortable, I have pretty much most of what I want in life (that money can buy anyway) and can more of less sit on the sidelines, plinking a few coins and plopping a few fishing lines into the river sufficient to suit my needs.
BTW your **FOLD** would have been funnier if it was somehow more like the [Monty Python *"Run Away. Run Away! RUN AWAY!!"* bit]( -- but of course that wouldn't be "Sparta!" (And since I've never seen that movie, I have no idea if there was a "RETREAT!" scene in it).
Also, just as an example of the "long tail" and the crash-then-slow-decline in the aftermath of a pump &amp; dump -- there's [THIS graphic -- **a classic dotcom era bubble stock**]( -- which just happened to be presented by Imgur alongside one of yours.

An fairly good choice of analogy.
Especially in regard to the price, value and demand for "diamonds" as "precious" gemstones (especially over and above other [sparkly crystals]( that have only a slightly different refraction index and which virtually no one call tell apart, and even if they can... should it matter?) -- **is entirely dependent upon a sustained "hype"** -- which requires massive expenditures in terms of continual advertising (it's a relatively open, but little known, secret that most jewelers spend more on advertising than they do on the wholesale price of the "goods" that they sell).
And then relevant to the supply (which is where the analogy fails), there are two things that OUGHT to enlighten people:
1. The main use of "diamond" is actually as an industrial abrasive.
2. The diamond suppliers not only "hoard" and act as a cartel to limit the supply of the so called "gemstones" but they actually CRUSH the vast majority of what they mine (because of 
In fact almost the entire "market" for the diamond gemstones is really the selling of something else... I say it crudely: it's about "pussy". 
Women whore themselves out for it (and are generally subsequently *shocked* to find out {typically after divorce} that the things are essentially worthless on resale -- the secondary market is sustained only as a "bargain" fraction of the retail price set by jewelers -- if/when the hype actually dies {i.e. the advertising fails, or the "courting" system changes in a way that undermines it} then the pawn-shop price for even "real" diamond-jewelry will plummet to basically just above that of "costume" jewelry made out of cut glass.)
Any man with an ounce of brains -- but who is nevertheless bent on purchasing a particular piece of vagina (one that demands he pay in the form of "real" diamonds) -- will buy "used" from a pawn-shop rather than a jeweler. If he's smarter yet, he'll just source an online cubic zirconia thing (which is probably what he'll end up getting anyway -- even if he thinks he's paying for "real" diamonds).

The more important point was made a year ago, and that is what % is actually part of the "float" and being either used in commerce or actively traded.
[The answer, as of a year ago is a lot LESS than people think](
Add in that we know there have been significant new "speculative hoarders" added into the equation, as well as the pervasive "buy &amp; hold -- cause I'm in it for the long term gain" mentality... and it is unlikely to have changed much since then.
Basically the earliest miners/adopters are (still) sitting on hoards... they may be "cashing out" little by little, but are essentially just *squatting* on the lion's share of the things. (Which OUGHT to tell you a lot -- since they COULD have been using then in "commerce" -- but they aren't.)

A temporary bump in price, followed by a more significant drop within a fairly short period of time (what is typically seen as either a "bull trap" or a "dead cat bounce").
You're *highly* unlikely to be able to create (yet another) round of artificially driven "pumping" to restart the speculative fever for at least another year or so (more likely a bit longer than that).  You first need to give most of the wounded time to nurse their wounds and either recover their enthusiasm or to leave altogether and for their to be a sufficient amount of new virginal "fresh blood" ~~suckers~~ erm I meant ~~marks~~ um, *enthusiasts* (yeah that's the word!) to be recruited so that another round of viral pumping can begin.
And keep in mind that you can only pull this trick just so many times -- as each iteration of the ~~scam~~ *promotion* gets larger, more people become aware of it, and get burned/inoculated against it, and so are immune to the subsequent efforts (though a small number may be willing to join in as "carriers" to infect others in order to make a quick buck off of it)... but invariably, inevitably, one of the iterations will have become so large that the burned-over area will have reduced the amount of available tinder, and you won't be able to light off any major conflagration in the same way afterwards.
If the fire was large enough, it will never happen again with the same base system (i.e. when was the last time there was a major speculative round in tulip bulbs?); and you will need to move onto some "new thing" as the basis for the scam/scheme.

Define "near future".
If you mean a week or month, I'd say "no way".  If you mean a year to 2 years, then I'd say you're likely correct -- this particular "con operation" still has legs; and I think it can go for (at least) one more (far larger) iteration before the land is totally burned over.  But it's going to be a while before people will forget and enough new suckers can be brought on board to promote and fall for it.

The thing is that the "fear &amp; despair" never quite sink to the lows that they otherwise would have...
BTW, bitcoin is NOT currently in "fear &amp; despair" stage... it's the "bull trap" right now; it'll go back up, and then sink lower before plateauing for several months.
And what it critical to realize is that the REASON they do not, is not what the advocates want to believe, it is not because bitcoin is being used as a currency -- rather it is because there are deep pocket speculators who are using that period of time to refill their hoards for the next runup (i.e. they are doubling down, in anticipation of the next group of "greater fools" to buy in during the subsequent "New Paradigm" phase).
Eventually (inevitably) that final collapse WILL come, and with each iteration it becomes more likely because as the perceived value grows, the pockets of the speculators will inevitably not prove deep enough...
That is what happens with ALL "pump &amp; dump manias".

All they REALLY have to do is seize Mt Gox -- and actually they don't even have to do that.  The Treasury (or any other US federal "regulator", like the OCC) could simply issue a press release about some administrative tax-based "freeze/lockup" notice regarding the listed owners (even without names, via "John Doe") and/or ISP service providers of MtGox, declaring them personally liable, yada yada, etc.
Regardless of the statutory legality of such an order, "failure to comply" would then be the valid grounds for prosecution; and chaos would ensue.
Why only MtGox?  Because they are [the lion's share (nearly 2/3) of the bitcoin exchange]( Despite the claims that bitcoin is "decentralized" it is in fact probably THE single most "centralized" (and therefore vulnerable) system around.
Takeout MtGox and you effectively collapse the whole Bitcoin system (the rest of the exchanges would probably go DOS as everyone scrambled for the exits).

Most women have bought into the shallow appeal that the advertising/meme sells: i.e. that diamonds = love; and that the more the guy spends (i.e. wealth he squanders/destroys) the more he "loves" you.
It's inane, and any woman with a lick of sense wouldn't fall for it... but in my experience, they are generally pretty rare creatures.


The correlation is that the diamond retailers have found a "story" that sells to specific demographics -- chiefly single women being proposed to, and indirectly men who propose to them.
And bitcoin has likewise found a "story" that appeals to a couple of demographics: the anarcho-techy crowd -- which has the added incentive that they tend to be both young and inexperienced (i.e. naive in terms of things like pump &amp; dump) AND they are good at doing viral promotion (so essentially "free" advertising).
Of course the recent iterations haven't been hurt by the fact that the mainstream media has looked at it as an interesting little side story (though I have doubts that it is entirely "natural" versus having some "push" from behind the scenes with various financial speculators).
Keep in mind that the TOTAL number of current bitcoin holders is actually rather trivial -- and the vast majority of them own less than a single bitcoin (i.e. a fractional BTC ... play-money, not a major asset).
Worse the "value" is being set by a fraction of non-hoarded float -- since the majority of the people buying into it are doing so as long-term "holders", relatively little of it is being traded back and forth; and virtually none of it is actually being used as a currency in normative commerce (less total commerce in dollar value terms than many a tiny "wide spot in the road" small towns).

But of course... Bitcoin is **first**, which means it's the *Sony BETAmax*, the *Friendster* or *MySpace* or indeed the *AOL* of cryptocurrencies so of course that means it WILL be ultimately triumphant, just like they were!

And keep in mind that are not merely the "creators" but the "holders" (hoarders) of the vast majority of the things.

And a true currency is the other way around. The "commerce" transactions are orders of magnitude higher than the "idle" (hoarded) amounts.

The thing is that in a sense this is inevitable.
In order for the things to get ANY traction at all, they needed to create the perception that they were "rare" and/or "hard to obtain" -- at the same time, they also needed to have a sufficient supply on hand to be able to pretty much meet the initial demand.
I have no doubt that they DID intend on "holding/hoarding" some significant fraction of the things (enough to become REALLY wealthy) -- but at the same time, I doubt they intended to hoard such a substantial % of them.
The problem they faced is akin to that of founders of successful companies who retained majority stock holdings -- i.e. Bill Gates; even ignoring things like security laws:
1. They CANNOT (practically) sell their hoard all at once -- the market for the stock (or bitcoin) would completely crash and the things would essentially become worthless.
2. Given the sheer size of their holdings even a STEADY divestiture (sell off) of a tiny fraction of the hoard is far larger than the the current "float" -- and risks tanking the "at the margin" value.
Now Gates HAS managed to sell off ore than 2/3 of his holdings (he once had well over a billion shares and is down now to around 350 million shares, still that's basically equal to the *total holdings* of the Vanguard Group via it's host of indexed mutual funds) -- but he had to do that over a period of YEARS (essentially a decade) -- and the periods (in 2010..2011, and again late 2012/early 2013) that he sold the largest chunks [it had a major downward effect on the stock's value]( because the market had a hard time digesting that volume, even though it was "metered out" over weeks/months.
And then of course to avoid forking over inordinate amounts in taxes, Gates has shuffled a lot of it into the "philanthropic fund" (which let's him play power-broker, exert control and gain benefits from the investments while pretending to be a "saint").
**But back to bitcoin...** the thing is that as it is right now, the initial miners sitting on the big hoards CAN live rather comfortably by cashing out relatively TRIVIAL amounts (indeed as the at the margin value increases, they can live comfortably doling out *ever SMALLER* amounts), but the float really hasn't expanded all that much, and you have to keep in mind that new bitcoins ARE still being mined at a relatively steady pace.

More like virtual house-flipping.

Of course I can't.  We're talking about *predicting the FUTURE*, and by definition one cannot have "proof" of that.  I am just making a conjectural projection of probable future timeframes given previous bubbles within the same con scheme that have occurred in the past (and it seems to take somewhat more than a year for the previous bubble-burst to be forgotten, and for a new "cycle", with new "rubes/marks" to be recruited to promote via media &amp; blogosphere, etc).


and assorted other places will be full of people telling you to be patient and that this is a "new paradigm", etc.  (\*Yawn\*)


What's the urgency?  
As I noted, there is no urgency here in terms of buying INTO this particular bubble of the pump &amp; dump cycle ... it's currently in the fear/capitulation phase and headed downward (as the proverbial "bagholders" decide to cut their losses and heads downward to double-digit {and probably $x-teen USD} figures).

Afraid I wasn't paying that much attention, I mean I know those were image/graphics, but I have to admit I didn't actually see either of them.
Didja by any chance have an image link to them you could post?  You've piqued a vague interest, but not sufficient to go digging for them.
