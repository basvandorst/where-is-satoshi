Its good to see that Ron Paul's answers about bitcoin are getting more refined and thoughtful. His initial reaction to bitcoin was that of a conservative gold bug, and I am very happy to see that he keeps to his principles of free competition even when faced with something he doesn't necessarily understand or have a good gut reaction about himself.

@_date: 2014-05-21 09:45:43
Around 550 to 600 is my guess. Busting a large exchange with tax/ponzi scheme as an excuse. It's the last card they can play though, and the sub 400 spike would be shortlived

Agreed, it is obviously a bad thing. I was just saying that the likelihood of some lone villain getting 600k coins from gox in February and dumping them now is very low. Most likely these coins have been circled around plenty for years.

I would not call the flaws minimal. His reasoning has a lot of problems.
He complains about bitcoin enthusiasts being elitist, then in the next sentence he goes on to complaining about how the same bitcoin enthusiast aren't real liberty activists that haven't been part of the real struggle against the system. He basically says (in an elitist way) that "real" liberty proponents need to suffer and bang their head against the wall.
A lot of other points like the malware that mines for hackers is just obsolete as mining has become more specialised. He also brings up the "unknown suspicious creator" argument which shows a big misunderstanding of open source programs. 
This is just from a cursory glance as well. He shows a lack of willingness to learn (pasting obsolete arguments against bitcoin from other sources) in a way that makes me thing that he's just trying to justify some sort of initial gut reaction against anything that isn't gold. (No idea if he really is a gold proponent, I'm just saying this because the same cluster arguments that they often use are presented here).
@_date: 2014-03-14 07:35:02
The fact that he paid back Japanese yen fully (fraud against foreigners can often go unpunished in Japan), together with delayed fiat withdrawals  for half a year makes it quite obvious that he knew. If that isn't enough, we have the fact that he rather got into a losing lawsuit vs. coinlab than releasing his records, and that he never hired anyone competent or considered selling part of the company at a 100+ mil valuation. Any of those three would expose the missing coins. There's just no way he didn't know about the missing coins.

The one upside of this (This is actually good news!) is that since the coins have been missing for a long time they would be sold and priced in already.

I just want to clear up the "bitcoin is slow because of 10 min confirmations" myth.
Confirmation times mean nothing. Once a transaction has been broadcast, and the network has been scanned for a double spend attack, it is safe to deliver. This is why for example Bitpay allows instant transactions. 
Bitcoin is actually the fastest of the coins because of the big number of nodes causing a faster propagation of transactions.
For comparison, an altcoin confirmation of say, 1 min, is 10 times less secure than a 10 min bitcoin confirmation. So if you want to wait for three confirmations for bitcoin you have to wait for 30 confirmtions for the altcoin. 
If you want to go for altcoins, I recommend going for the ones that are substantially different than bitcoin, and that you view that investment as a turbo risk investment (viewing bitcoin as high risk, any alt coin investment is riskier by an additional multiplier). I would not see altcoin investment as a diversification, given that almost anything that would take down bitcoin would take down the alts as well.

That's just my estimate. BTW, there's an additional factor that traders have to beat: The additional counter party risk of keeping money/bitcoin on trading sites, as the recent insolvency of mtgox shows.
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:57:21
This isn't really the focus of this thread, but I highly doubt that gox lost their coins recently. Given their delayed withdrawals (a tell-tale sign of any company dipping into customer funds) implies insolvency as early as mid 2013. There's additional signs of insolvency in that gox never entertained the idea of selling shares or hire outside accountants (or anyone competent at all really). Both of these imply that gox had to do everything to keep their accounting secret since, well, forever. Additionally, gox fully paid off any Japanese customers, which puts him in a much better position legally in Japan. That was done knowingly at the same time as other customers had to wait. 
I personally think that gox either got hacked, lost their private keys, or gambled against the market and lost during 2011 or 2012. All of these scenarios means that the potential of a huge sell off is limited. Either a lot of the coins would be sold already, or they would be gone forever.

Bitcoin mining fits the dictionary definition of capitalism perfectly, because the means of production are privately owned and can accumulate capital.
The fact that there generally isn't much wage labour (except possibly minor assembly and maintenance work) involved with mining isn't very relevant.
TLDR: capitalism=/=wage labour
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:26:27
Shorter block times does not make a coin "faster", because the merchant in the OP would just require more blocks for the same level of security. A coin with a block time of 1 min on average would need 30 blocks to be as secure as a coin with three 10 min blocks. 
The bitcoin network is also larger than any altcoin, which makes it faster and more secure for zero block transactions. So in fact all alt coins are currently slightly slower than bitcoin if you ant to be technically precise.
Shorter block time can also increase the risk of denial of service attacks during certain circumstances.
Unfortunately the shorter block time argument for altcoins preys on a common technical misunderstanding, so please spread the word about how this actually works.

True, one of the most common problems I see is the misconception that you can start a business with the payment method somehow being the one thing that separates you.

Personally I think that bitcoin might be the final nail in the coffin for the fallacious deflation argument (as if it weren't enough that the us had a double digit growth for a hundred years using a deflationary currency). If the market expect deflation, they will just bid more on the currency, increasing the purchasing power until people start to spend it again. The only thing that is needed as far as I am concerned is liquidity to calm the exchange rate fluctuations. And that will come, just give it a few years.

This is not true, with something like bitcoin the "elite" will have to spend bitcoins to get stuff. When its spent they will never get it back without creating value and trade it for new coins.
This is in strong contrast with the current system where governements and banks can create new money, creating a stealth tax of sorts.
Bitcoin (or gold for that matter) makes it so that it is in everybody's interest towards creating wealth and trading it, rather than spending effort on protecting the privilege to supply money. 
In a theoretical bitcoin world there would also be less counter party risk, as it gets rid of the trusted third party. This is something that we only have seen the tip of the iceberg of, and it has the potential to free up a lot of resources. 
On top of this bitcoin makes it possible (and very easy) to keep transparent accounting on for example politicians and other public servants.

The mining and proof of work system replaces a trusted third party, which in the current financial system has an incredibly large cost. All those marble buildings in the centres of cities, full of highly paid people in suits, aren't cheap.

Did he really think he would be able to operate without paying the appropriate bribes? Amateur.

Are you referring to the 1mb block size limitation? That can potentially be increased.

The only thing that could be a downside is that he is rather hardcore about banks being evil and such. I hope he would be smart enough to avoid going too deep into that stuff if baited in a mainstream debate.
But yeah he is the best spokesperson for sure. While Molyneaux and Vorhees has their niches, Andreas is an incredible speaker for a more general audience. He has that emotional and motivational fire while still being very clear and understandable in his explanations.

Exactly, taxes are already highest where it is easy to enforce regardless of currency in use, like salaries, property and such. Taxes are also regressive in that its mostly common man things that are taxed, and that larger companies pay less tax than small companies for example. This is likely how it always will be regardless of bitcoin or any other financial technological advances.
Maybe that a small segment of new industries like search engine optimisers and other web oriented professions are able to avoid taxes better than other professions, but that is such a small percentage of people.

Hard drive space seems to keep up nicely, and there's supposedly ways to prune the block chain. I'm in one of the most internet retarded countries on earth and these things aren't even close to problem here yet. I'm not trying to  to ignore the problem, but I don't really see a doomsday scenario here.

Agreed, I went there looking for this number too, and was disappoint.

If bitcoin succeeds it will embarrass a lot of economists. Kind of like communications professors that ignored the internet, but it is even more fundamental than that. Bitcoin can disprove entire economic schools and the countless lifelong careers built on them.

Yes, I am almost certain that the price of bitcoin is in a downtrend towards $600-700, but I just can't sell and rebuy later because of this. If there's some big news about this fund passing through (or any other huge and similar news) it'll be huge.
