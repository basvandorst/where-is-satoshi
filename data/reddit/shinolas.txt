I don’t why but this shot looks like it’s from an 80s movie cutaway scene

I do not know the future. This is why I hold them.

Is this one of those last word things? My previous reply already addressed both of these.  Enjoy your day my dude.

I agree bcash is shit. But I’m still holding it as long as it tracks with bitcoin. Maybe on the next major run I’ll dump it but probably not.

See previous reply and care less kid.

Is it? Is it the Dunning Kruger effect? Interesting take. Glad you took the high road ��. Alright bud, on to the next Internet argument that needs your energy.

I’m not here to argue for bcash. Put your panties back on. No one can predict the future.

Relax. I’m pro bitcoin all day. But on the off chance that scam artist pulls off an upset, I’m safe at zero cost to me. I sell now and fuck a hedged position because of the high ground or some shit? Fuck that.

Spray gambling. Lol. I guess hanging onto your forked coins is spray gambling *shrug* 
Listen my dude. Ima let bcash scale and see what happens. If that infuriates you and sends you on a bitcoin missionary quest, my bad. I could care less about you what think is or isn’t hedge. You can die on that hill. 
And yeah, sorry kiddo, I’m not gonna sit here and try and lay out hypothetical scenarios to a bitcoin mainliner on bcash succeeding. That’s like pitching donations for the policeman’s ball to a black kid. 
Relax bro. Bitcoin shall triumph. My “hedge” ���� won’t change anything.

Lol how you get so emotional about me holding bcash is hilarious to me. 
Breath bro. It is a hedge in case bitcoin fails and bcash does not. Is it likely? No. But I didn’t throw any money at it, was free with the fork. So I’m holding it.  It’s also not throwing away an opportunity if bcash goes exponential at any point that I would have missed by selling for “fundamentals” sake.  Plenty of crypto traders have diversified their portfolio. Honestly your emotional take on this is the exact opposite of how successful investors behave. 
If you want to throw a tantrum and scream it’s not a hedge because bcash can’t possibly survive without bitcoin, then throw your tantrum but you’re arguing semantics. It is a hedge by the very definition of the word, whether it’s a successful hedge is debatable.  
Don’t talk down to people because you’re emotionally invested. It’s quite transparent.

Can I borrow your crystal ball?

Unpopular maybe but fuckin hedge. I got an equal amount of bcash when it split and I’m just holding it.
