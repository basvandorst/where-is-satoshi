This was my first try at investing in cryptocurrency. I've been sitting on the fence while some of my friends and family was early into Bitcoin and other coins. Two days ago, when the price was at the lowest i thought to myself that this was the oppertunity and decided to invest a small sum. I registered and sent in the verification at all the big exchange markets. Unfortunately, they all had problems keeping up with all the people trying to register, so I decided to try one of the sites where it seemed easier and found Changelly. They didnt even require a registration! So I went ahead and finished up the order, and then I found out they wanted me to verify myself. "Well, at least ive put in the order so everything should be cool", i thought to myself. First of all, the verification will be quicker here since they only verify orders and not everyone just registering, and since ive finished the order, they surely will deliver the bitcoins at the right exchange rate at the time of purchase, right? Well, boy was I wrong! Almost 48 hours later, and with a exchange rate almost 3k USD higher, I received the mail that they have canceled the order because "of changes in the bitcoin rate". How professional!
I am super dissapointed and I dont understand what kind of business practise Simplex is running.
TL:DR: Simplex just cancelled my first ever order of bitcoins to save money, 48 hours after i put in the order.
EDIT: Now I dont know if i should wait a couple hours and see if it dips a little again, or just buy now at 12.3k $.
