Honestly the system isn't to be trusted in general, you are right.
But a writing class at a community college could help you a lot... not trying to be rude.

I'm trying to find out info as I'm getting back into BTC. Why is Coinbase bad? Simply because they fail to fulfill orders?
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:10:23
Where can you buy BTC with a CC?
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:20:13
Feel free to elaborate, OP.

Is it true if you are holding your coins on an exchange you'll miss out on the fork?
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:25:41
Hmmm... I mean yeah if I made a lot of money I'd want to comply just so everything's legit... why wouldn't someone want to?

I'm just saying some people disagree with you. Ideally you'll hold on your own device, i.e. hardware, paper, or some other wallet, but others have said if you don't know what you're doing exactly, that keeping it on an exchange is the safer option.
Honestly it doesn't seem that unsafe at all to hold it on an exchange, depending which it is.

As far as wallets, aren't they physical things? I'd be so scared of losing mine.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:37:05
Surely 1 hour isn't all it takes to mine a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:28:31
How drastic? As far as I can tell it's just fees that total to ~$30 per $1000 you put in.

I've read that if you don't know what you're doing, really, that holding on an exchange is the safer option. 
I don't have any BTC myself, just trying to learn before I invest at all.

What even is Segwit? Help.

Hi. I'm thinking about rebuying in to btc. I had two bitcoins at $550 in 2013 and sold them when it crashed back to that amount. 
Can you elaborate a bit more on your meaning here? I don't know the "dollar cost average" thing. 
How much should I buy? I've got $6500 in the bank...
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:16:04
Don't sell them.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:44:15
Can you go into this further? Why is Coinbase less safe than a wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:47:32
Is that last part true if you're using a site like Coinbase that is clearly centralized somewhere that could collapse itself?
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:19:22
I'd be even more scared of losing a paper wallet! Ack!

Is ethereum considered an alt coin?
