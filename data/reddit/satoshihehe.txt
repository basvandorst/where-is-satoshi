Very easy. Fun story: tried opening a bank account in UK last year to get better rates. Turned down due to bad credit. Wasted days trying to find reason via experion,  still don't know why I got turned down. Needed to open fidor bank for kraken. Made account online in minutes and just showed my passport to a guy in a suit over Skype and I now have a bank with a better interest rate which I can use to buy bitcoin without the bullshit fees we get in the uk. Unlike NatWest fidor charge like 1.50 for a sepa transfer with good conversion rates, NatWest charge like 35 quid or more. Not that I can even find the info on their shit site

Trevon James is a complete and utter retard. Either he has been given lots of Piecoin by mr Pie Man and has another wallet with shitloads of coins to dump (I know he shows his wallet off) or he bought months ago. You guys are retarded if you think you are going to get rich off this week's scam coin.
I am not wasting my time highlighting how retarded falling for scam coins is. It has happened before with Chain Coin and a lot of people got burnt. If people were just patient and bought bitcoin and waited until 2020 or beyond they can make actual gains and be part of something big and important; piecoin is neither.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:13:38
I don't really understand the question. Less supply of something would create a higher price assuming the demand stays the same. The point is there will only be around 16.5 mil bitcoins around in 10 or so years because of the amount lost by idiots losing their private keys, satoshis untouched millions etc. So the 815 billion dollar market cap of apple would equate to a 50k bitcoin.
If everyone who currently has bitcoin decides they do not want to sell, no matter what, then the liquidity will go down drastically, resulting in higher prices.

You tend to get this crap any time you say anything mildly relating to any country other than your own, especially China where culture and language barriers make it very challenging to actually have an idea what is going on over there with regard to crypto. They generally don't speak our language and they view the world through a very distorted lens (great firewall of china + banning films etc).
Apparently saying "China sucks, i would hate to live in such an autocratic society living under an oppressive regime" is basically like dropping the N bomb on reddit. I understand the people in China don't like it. I know they are suffering. I am saying their government sucks and anyone complicit and not fighting against it also sucks to a lesser degree.

I don't know what you know about the state of the world, but in case you haven't being paying attention, since the mid 70s the rich have been getting richer and the poor have been getting poorer in the us and most developed country and there has been plenty of inflation. The inequality has grown with the ability to get loans and cheap credit. This shit isn't working.

Imagine your own wallet. You watch it, you are really careful with it and you notice if money is spent. Now imagine it has millions of other peoples money in it. You would keep an eye on it surely? Do audits etc. How is it possible he didn't know what was going on? I suspect collusion
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:17:27
To add another step of security incase you are worried your private keys might have been compromised already, create a new wallet on electrum offline and move all the bitcoin to that when you have transferred your private keys to the first wallet on the offline pc. Move a small amount back and forth and get comfortable first. Take your time and stop worrying.

@_date: 2017-07-28 11:01:51
It is very important you do all this on a computer which has never gone online. If your private keys have been on a computer which has been online you must create a brand new wallet from scratch after you have done this on an offline pc, and send the bitcoin from the newly set up electrum wallet after you have imported the keys.
I am suggesting you take the private keys from the armory wallet and put them into the electrum wallet. Imagine a wallet like a key chain, you take the keys off and transfer them to another key chain. then you can send your bitcoin to a safe offline wallet.

The passphrase is the password you set to encrpyt the private keys. You cannot spend the bitcoin or move them without knowing it
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:14:09
I did this myself as I found armory impractical. Electrum is good. All wallets store private keys. These keys are what access the bitcoin which are stored on the block chain. Imagine a wallet as a keychain which stores keys and these keys unlock your vaults on the block chain. 
Take your time and do the following and try and find instructions online if unsure.
I don't know the full procedure off the to of my head but you need to do the following. I am assuming you have your private keys stored on a completely offline computer, otherwise a hacker can take your keys.
 Export the private keys, while offline, pull the internet out on the PC. Import the keys into electrum on an offline computer which will never go online again with that hard drive. Write down the seed words. Those words generate the wallet should your offline PC die. 
While on the offline PC, create a watch  only wallet and copy it to a USB (there are safer methods if you are paranoid) to your online PC. Install electrum on your online PC and import the watch only wallet. You can now see your balance but not spend. To spend you must create a transaction and save it to a USB to be signed by the offline computer, then put it back in the online computer and broadcast the signed transaction.
Get a hardware wallet, its just as safe and easier. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:08:49
Armory needs core installed and updated to run. But I had issues and gave up with it. Core is basically the block chain. Electrum doesn't need the block chain locally to work

I was worried when I couldn't get armory to sync properly and couldn't do a transaction and move my bitcoin to another wallet. So I exported the private keys to an easier to use wallet. Electrum is open source, trusted and reliable and unlike armory you don't need to download the block chain. It is a lightweight client.
