I sold my LTC yesterday to buy bitcoin. Fml

My problem is I'm confirmed on coinbase but not on gdax. Will I need to submit ID to gdax?

Something something hyperbolic time chamber

New to cryptos. When bitcoin forks, does it matter where the coins are stored? If their in a wallet or in coinbase, either way would you get bitcoin cash during the split?

I would like to know this as well if it's going to be 8 days everytime. Just got into buying crypto this last weekend
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:03:59
Hmm what's the fee to buy vs coinbase?

Saw the price a bit ago, went to check and saw I could do it. Converted 3 LTC and 0.25 ETC

Newbie here, is there a difference between bitcoin core and just regular bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:31:49
Ya but how much is a good amount to hold? I only have 0.01 btc

Well that was fast. I first got in back at the 6000 bcash dip. Now I wish I'd gone all in. Oh well

Where do you go to get tipped free bitcoin? Also ask @_date: 2017-11-12 05:42:19
So when a fork happens, like with bitcoin cash and bitcoin, do you get the "free" bitcoin cash if it's in your wallet or if it's an exchange like coinbase?

Just got into crypto today. This whole drama has me really lost lol. As if learning the basics wasn't hard enough. Now reading about coinbase on here has me concerned as I had bought bitcoin litecoin and ethereum all through there. But that's taking 10 days to arrive

What would be the advantage if any of using coinbase instead of gdax?
