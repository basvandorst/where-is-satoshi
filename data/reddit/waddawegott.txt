They charge a % and exchange rate converting your btc at a higher rate than the price of BTC at time of payment. You can lose 15% of your precious btc doing this by letting these evil companies take your btc and convert it to the evil fiat on your behalf to pay your bills

Good to hear, but none of my utility companies accept bitcoin yet. Which utility companies were accepting bitcoin since 2015? I don’t think we are in the same position in life, bitcoin Yoda.

We haven’t quite reached that point yet unfortunately. You could not find me one single example of a BTC store or merchant that had something priced at 0.01 BTC 2 months ago that’s priced at 0.01 BTC today. I do use my wallet to pay for some things but at this point in time the price of BTC on goods is almost always converted by a fiat rate. Am I supposed to wait until all BTC are mined and it globally rules the world before I can spend 0.01 profit? Useless conversation

Honestly you’re giving away 7-15+% for one of these businesses to convert to fiat, a lot of times probably visa for you. So as long as you don’t see it and you lose BTC its ok?
I understand WHY you do what you’re doing, but most people havent been HODLing since 2015 based on Satoshis papers.

Oh sorry. Am I only allowed to say HODL here? I have a ledger nano S which I HODL in and I’m sure I’m not the only person here who has ever converted some satoshis into fiat. In fact, that’s how many, if not most BTC transactions work still today. When purchasing something in BTC, it is mostly converted to the fiat exchange rate still.

That’s a retarded answer. Of course it has to do with bitcoin, just like Coinbase does, and other exchanges do. It’s a service how many businesses accept bitcoin as payment, moron

I guess I’m an idiot for not paying student loans in bitcoin or getting groceries in bitcoin

Don't the "instant deposits" take 5 business days? Same as if you were to use ACH on Coinbase?
