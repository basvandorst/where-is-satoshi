I know you got downvoted but this comment just stopped me from losing a few hundred dollars, so thanks for that.

Agreed lol. Bitcoiners are the most delusional type of investor I’ve ever come across. EVERYTHING that happens, up or down bad or good, somehow points to bitcoin going to the moon according to many on here.

Yeah that’s what I’m gonna do. I stupidly bought in at 12.4 and got straight raped so I think I’m gonna short 75% and try and buy lower.

Wow I’m super glad I took my profits and sold everything at 11.8k earlier this week. Now time to buy some more! Sometimes you just gotta take profits where you can.

Yeah I realized but it was too late.

No one knows, everything is speculation.

Yeah I’m still learning the ropes haha. Right now I’m still up 30 bucks so not all hope is lost just yet.

As an 18 year old who just threw in 1.5k more this huge up down roller coaster over the past 30 min is scaring me lol

Wow this was not how I hoped to start my day

Going back up lightning speed now this is fucked

As in about an hour ago. I’ve been day trading it for weeks and I thought fuck it I’m not missing out anymore.

Thanks for the advice! I’m still kicking myself for not buying in full and committing back at 6k, but I was new to the crypto scene then. However now I’m in it for the long haul, day trading it has proven to be less profitable. However I’ve made about $100 so far which is about 10 hours of work at my job, so I’ll take it!

What a rollercoaster. Panic sold half of my stash at 11.8, realized my mistake the moment I sent it, then send a request to buy it back instantly but it didn’t process until 12.5. Feels bad man :( . Still learning the ropes.
