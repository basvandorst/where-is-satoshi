And to reiterate, The Microsoft Store policy says you can buy Microsoft Store merchandise with Microsoft Currency.  They sell Skype credit vouchers on the Microsoft store.  Don't accuse me or OP of not reading policy before buying, because WE DID.  (Maybe it's the Microsoft PR department trolling us???).  We are coming for justice, you thieving bastards... you're going to need every one of those high priced lawyers.

I've been permanently suspended from using my Microsoft account AND my Skype account.  First they steal my money, then they lock me out of my own accounts.  Damn, Microsoft is fucking evil.  I guess I'll wait until it happens to more people, people with the balls to do something about it.  I know I wasn't the first and I won't be the last.

People, get off your soap box please.  Neither myself or OP ever criticized bitcoin in any way.  This thread is about MICROSOFT stealing customer's bitcoin.  Since they are stealing BITCOIN it is in the BITCOIN subreddit.  If you use bitcoin or support bitcoin as a currency, then you should want to know when and how bitcoin users are getting ripped off.  Together we stand, divided we fall.

OK so I spent over two hours online with a Microsoft store support agent AND a Skype support agent, both talking to each other.  MS support agent was "Jennilyn". The Skype support agent, Jommel S. Was viewing my computer screen and controlling it via remote access.  Even with both agents talking, and me showing my accounts, they could not figure out how to add the Skype credit I purchased on the MS store to my Skype account.  WHAT A NIGHTMARE!  The chat log is below:
11:02 AM ..: Here is what I did:
11:02 AM ..: I logged in to my MS account
11:02 AM Jommel S: At the first place, when puhasing credits for Skype.
11:02 AM ..: In the MS store, I added 2 $50 skype cards to my cart
11:02 AM Jommel S: You need to log-into your Skype accoumy
11:02 AM Jommel S: not in the MS account
11:03 AM ..: Then I completed the sale as a guest using bitcoin
11:03 AM ..: Then the site errored while it was saying "processing transaction"
11:03 AM ..: Then I refreshed the page
11:03 AM Jommel S: Okay ther fore, there is nothing I can do about it
11:03 AM Jommel S: It is a Microsoft error
11:03 AM ..: Then it just went back to the MS store home page
11:04 AM ..: But then all of a suddent I had $100 avialable in my MS account
11:04 AM Jommel S: Yes I know, but it is not for Skype
11:04 AM ..: Microsoft and Skype are the same company
11:04 AM Jommel S: Okay here is what I can suggest
11:04 AM Jommel S: Please contact them via email
11:04 AM ..: My MS account and Skype account are linked
11:04 AM ..: they will not give me an email address to contact
11:05 AM Jommel S: Send them a screen shots
11:05 AM Jommel S: Of the 100 dollars avaialble on your account
11:05 AM Jommel S: So jsut to clarify.
11:05 AM Jommel S: Skype have nothing to do with this
11:06 AM ..: Skype has everything to do with it, because the MS store told me that only Skype support can help with the issue
11:06 AM Jommel S: No
11:06 AM Jommel S: There is no order
11:06 AM Jommel S: showinng on your Skyep account

11:06 AM Jommel S: There is no order as well on your MS account.
11:06 AM Jommel S: Where are those details?
11:07 AM ..: I have the same question
11:07 AM Jommel S: So that is why it is full microsoft issue
11:07 AM Jommel S: Because you place the order using   theier website
11:07 AM ..: Why don't you ask microsoft to remove the MS store credit, then you guys can give me Skype credit
11:07 AM Jommel S: Because if you placed it using Skype then it will register on our end
11:08 AM Jommel S: We need to fix this first
11:08 AM Jommel S: On the Microsoft end
11:08 AM ..: ok please help me fix it

Hey I just had the same experience after adding funds to my microsoft account by "redeeming bitcoin".  They sell Skype credit on the microsoft store, but for some reason it won't let you use MICROSOFT STORE funds to purchase it??  Mrshadel is right, this is illegal.  Especially since there is no notification during the redeem bitcoin process that your purchasing ability will be limited to certain products. Everybody with shared experiences please message me, I plan to initiate a class action lawsuit.
