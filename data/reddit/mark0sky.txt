Actually it depends on the time locked period. You don't need to always be online, but at least one time in the period. That doesn't seems too difficult.

You could buy another couple of Trezor or Ledger and distribute the coins a bit. For the seeds, you could procure some cheap flash drives (of different brand/models), create a VeraCrypt volume, and put the seed there (all from Tails). Then spread the copies/drives: home, car, some friends / parents, etc.

Agree.

There will be other changes to better adapt Bitcoin to an evolving scenario.

Possibly. But a nice thing about BCTip is that if one don't redeem the credit within the expiration date, the bitcoins are returned to an address of your choice. So that will prompt the need to at least install a Bitcoin wallet, and make a transfer. Some people just "click" when they actually see Bitcoin at work.

IMHO, Paypal is about integration and simplification. If they'll add Bitcoin as another currency, one will be able to send bitcoins to Paypal and then pay for something on eBay in USD. Or pay something that's sold only for bitcoins, without having to worry about getting some (for a fee, of course). Or move some Euro to the Bitcoin account, and get some bitcoins (for a fee, again). It will be convenient &amp; handy for some, or in some cases. Most users already skilled in Bitcoin, will continue handling Bitcoin themselves, saved the occasional send to Paypal to buy something not (yet) payable in bitcoins directly, maybe.

Since you had many unwanted upvotes, here's a downvote for you. :)

Some people just don't get it, at this stage. For example, I suggested it too to a friend that own a business. He already heard about it, wasn't negative at all, but said something like "no one have ever asked me to pay in bitcoin, so I don't see the need". Bummer! Build it and they will come! Or may be not, but at this point there's also the free visibility and publicity that accepting bitcoins can bring. How do you ignore something like that?

I never tried it, obviously, but from all that I have seen on pictures and videos my impression of the Robocoin ATM was always of something too complex and cumbersome. I understand that much of this come as an added burden due to regulation compliance for the ability to convert BTC to FIAT. But spending BTCs is the easiest part. The problem that this machines should address is mostly getting BTCs. The Lamassu is a much a better concept, IMHO.

I instead started using [PurseIO]( to buy from Amazon in bitcoins and getting discounts.

I just don't think that going from BTC to "old money" is so interesting to justify the (understandable) complications.

A node would net help with that. But being a part of the P2P network may still be a nice thing / feelgood thing. The problem is that the Raspberry Pi is probably not very well suited to run a node, mainly due to the little amount of memory. At least with the current incarnation of Bitcoind.

If you use a payment processor like BitPay, you have no risks: you use Bitcoin just as a payment system, the bitcoins are instantly converted in your local currency, and sent to your bank. You have no fixed costs (if you opt for the 1% fees, which is probably your best option: no sale in bitcoins, no costs), or very low (for a forfait). Bitcoin transaction are irrevocable, so you don't have to deal with the chargebacks risks. Setting up an account is very simple, and you need just a old/slow tablet/smartphone and WiFi. At worst, that is if nonone ever buy using Bitcoin, you gain some free publicity/coverage just for the fact of accepting Bitcoin. You basically can't go wrong, IMHO.
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:00:29

I think the iPay system will be just a payment system tied to iTunes accounts. It will be very slick and refined, and it will be basically just an easy way to spend normal money. Sort of a PayPal on an iPhone. With the kind of connections and userbase of Apple, it could work nicely, for anyone already on that bandwagon.
But Bitcoin is so much more.
 
@_date: 2014-07-16 10:53:27
Nope. I think there are enough people willing to pay a (variable) premium to get bitcoins using a trusted &amp; familiar platform like Amazon. There are lot of peoples paying a premium to use Bitcoin vending machines, so it's not a strange thing at all. There will be also a percentage of fraudsters, no doubt, like in any other business that involve credit card payments. I think that Amazon have more experience than many other smaller business to deal with those.

I don't work for them. I just started to use it by about 2 weeks, and I would have been glad to have started before! That's why I'm enthusiast about it, and recommending it. I did the same with other services or things in the past (Mycelium come to mind), if you care to spend the time to review all my previous message history. :)
If there are still people that don't know that they can, in fact, spend bitcoins on Amazon, I think it may be a welcomed suggestion.

Write activity it's actually very low, and can be buffered and cached quite aggressively (with the Blockchain, you don't have to plan to avoid data loss at all costs). The reads, on the other end, are certainly not a problem.

Satoshi Nakamoto = Leah McGrath Goodman. She carefully planned things from day one, and choose a pseudonym that, when needed, could be linked to a man that loosely fit the profile. Makes perfect sense. Or anyway much more than that forensic by exclusion BS.

You create a wishlist on Amazon, set the correct delivery address.

If someone accept the offert, will buy the wishlist for you. You'll get the item, he'll get the bitcoins.

The incentive for the bitcoin spender is to use his bitcoins and get a discounted price. The incentive for the buyer is to be able to obtain bitcoins using a familiar process and means of payment (Amazon checkout, with a credit card for example). It's the same with the Bitcoin ATM: why bother when you can get cheaper coins at an exchange? Because (for some) it is more practical to insert some paper bills and get bitcoins that way.

Mentioning Karpeles, Brewster &amp; co. in the context, is like mentioning banking while evaluating a piggy bank / money box.

That's surely one way to see it. And I agree about the security due to the small sums. But I see ChangeTip also as a way to spread the knowledge of Bitcoin and encourage its use, so I instead like that it's not considered a spending wallet (even if it's usually pretty fast).

The "How Bitcoin Works Under the Hood" is surely one of the best around. Highly recommended. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:51:32
As a block has a size limit, it can only contains a limited amount of transactiona. The transactions that didn't make into that block, remain floating in the mem pool, waiting to be included in the next block, and so on.
So, it's not a problem until a lots of blocks start to hit the limit. If that happens, only the transactions that the miners choose to prioritize (the ones with a higher fee/size ratio) will be confirmed, and the others will be discarded.
But it's very unlikely to happens before the Bitcoin code will be updated to deal with an increasing number of transactions.

Having a personal Bitcoin wallet is a must, IMHO. And transferring money from a centralized system like ChangeTip (with his rules, times, restrictions, etc.) to something you have full control is a nice lesson to learn; the sooner the better. For example, people that use CoinBase as a personal wallet occasionally run in the same problems. They are just not the right tool for the job. ChangeTip is great to exchange small sums and spread bitcoins around. 
Installing a wallet like Mycelium o Bitcoin Wallet on a smartphone is super easy.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:26:07
Those are perfectly valid concerns, in general, but I think the key thing here is "Change". It's a service for moving trivial sums of money.

That fact that the protocol could handle say 20MB blocks doesn't mean that we would start seeing immediately blocks of that size. Like at the moment, for example, the average block size is less than 0.5MB.

As someone other suggested, worrying about the confirmation time is a byproduct of the tech mindset of the people usually involved with Bitcoin, that like to present and discuss this kind of details and inner workings.
Other payment systems you already use, to not make you worry, simply don't usually present the whole facts.
As a normal seller, considering a Bitcoin payment not secure for 10 minutes is like considering a credit card payment not secure for some weeks. Do you presently worry about that?
Regardless of that, if you opt for using a Bitcoin payment processor like BitPay, there's no reasons at all to worry about that, because it's a detail that BitPay deal with. Once they show you that the transaction is paid, it's paid.

IMHO Paper wallets are perfectly suited for (long term) storage (with adequate backup, encryption, etc.), but an hardware wallet is far more practical to actually use the funds. Not to mention more easy and idiot proof. The latter is an important point, IMHO. People here, with a tech background, always and rightly bother with malware, MITM attacks, and so on. But I think that for normal users it's currently far more easier to just screw up and potentially lose bitcoins. HW wallets are a very nice thing for the wide adoption of Bitcoin.

You're right of course. It probably was when I started writing the BIP.
But right now it show the problem that there's presently: to offer choices, Mycelium (or any other wallet) have to build an (increasingly big) list of a numbers of block explorers, and probably the next day a new one will surface and some users will nicely ask to add that too. And so on. Using the Blockchain URI, any block explorer or suitable kind of tool could offer the choice to a user to register it, and any blockchain reference will work with no additional efforts. And it's not restrict to wallet, too.
As for Mycelium, for example, the URI could initially be added as another one alternative, so it will keep working with all currently supported explorers, plus any the will eventually support the URI. In time, if/when the support will be more widespread, the list could probably be eliminated entirely. Or something like that. 
I take the occasion to page to ask if this is something they could consider supporting.

Here's a quick video of the demo handler: 
@_date: 2016-01-01 14:29:20


Basically, the idea is to use links like this:
Click or tap, and your preferred block explorer open. Like the bitcoin: URI do for payments.
I put some demo code here:  - It register the URI with a Python script that can open one (or more) of the configured block explorers, and there's a small sample page with some blockchain: links. N.B. Only main net is implemented in the script, for simplicity.
If you are a developer of any kind of related tool (wallet, explorer, etc.) you may consider implementing this new URI.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:28:59

Core must be scary too, in some ways, if Classic have got so quickly support for all the actors listed in their website (confirmed on Twitter, as PRs, or other similar public ways). I'm not trying to find justifications or motivations , or who's right and wrong here, just looking at the present facts.
And with that level of support, it's basically granted that there will be no "contentious" fork, or "two coins", or nothing like that, obviously.
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:10:21
IMHO, like other big actors, his phrasing imply that:
* they want to move to 2MB max block size ASAP
* they would very much like that this would come with the blessing / support of Core (too)
If Core would relent a bit and accept 2MB now, in addition to the rest of their schedule, they would retains the support of basically every one, and solve the whole situation in a blink.
Being absolutely uncompromising comes with consequences.
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:40:00
Very well said!
@_date: 2016-01-13 15:48:40
IMHO nothing strange will happens.
If Bitcoin Classic, for example, doesn't gain any significant support, everything remain as is now.
If it gain traction and approach the activation threshold, basically everyone will progressively move to make sure to stay on that chain. So either both nodes &amp; miners will move to that implementation, and/or maybe Core too will agree to include those different/new rules about blocksize, and that will be Bitcoin. And again, nothing happens.

I have a node running on a cheap HP microserver that I use anyway as a NAS (and other things). In the last 15 minutes, 2 new blocks were added on the blockchain, and the average CPU load was less than 15%. If I had to rebuy today a machine of the same segment, it would easily be 2-3 times faster, at least.
For a time I even kept a node running on a Raspberry, so...
If the blockchain would already be 600GB now instead of 65GB, it would make no difference to me. An HD is needed anyway (or at least is the cheaper option), and a 1TB one is less than 50$. So disk space is not even an argument worth considering. 
The only thing that I have to keep an eye on, is bandwidth. It's unmetered, so it's not a matter of costs. But I limit it a bit to be sure it's not slowing down other connections. There are plenty of options for that: limit the number of peer connections, limit up/download speed (either on the node or on the router), etc. So, not really a problem.

If you change PoW to something "home mineable", the current hashrate would not have anything to do with what you'll end up with.

You have to either extract the private keys and import them somewhere/somehow (not recommended if you haven't practice dealing with this), or simply wait. Only after, then create a new wallet with Electrum or MultiBit HD and send all your bitcoins from the old wallet to the new one with a normal transaction.
I'll just take the occasion to remark that, IMHO, all the website dealings with Bitcoin should clearly mark a full validating node + wallet combo as recommended only to experienced users. It just doesn't make sense to expect that a new user that is maybe moving is first steps with Bitcoin could be OK with waiting days to synchronize anything.

Like above, you have just to keep the wallet (Bitcoin Core, as it seems, in this case) running, and wait. It helps to have a fast connection, a fast CPU, and probably more an SSD.
Once it have finished, and verified that it have no bitcoins in it (as it should, since you have fresh installed it) you stop, copy  (not move!, keep a copy of it safe somewhere) your "wallet.dat" over the empty/default one (it will be in some place like: c:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin), restart, and you should see the bitcoins.

Yes, but they were also against dedicated Scrypt mining hardware. Plus just mining was probably just the quickest solution to make an easy buck.
A coin with a far greater appeal and market cap, would attract far more sophistication.
The number of compromised machines of a botnet could realistically surpass that of the total "regular" miners.

Since images are better than words, here's a graph with the last blocks:
On the first two the reduction is limited because the node was just started and so it was still building up his mempool.

@_date: 2016-02-26 21:02:23
Another thing that can influence the results: for example I have a min releay fee quite high to try to limit the mempool growing too much, so probably some transactions in the blocks may have not been in my mempool, and so needed to be relayed again.

@_date: 2016-02-27 16:55:23
Since the two system use different strategies, it's probably not very useful to compare the results of a specific block. It would be better to consider a longer sequences of blocks. Have you some average data like that at hand? I found a post where you referred to a 85% average compression on a 288 blocks serie, but it was from about 1 year ago. Would that still be valid or have the Relay Network become even better at reducing the amount of data? Thanks.
@_date: 2016-02-05 22:44:13
I suppose you can create one at [BetMoose](
@_date: 2016-02-26 23:24:06
They are totally different things, and not mutually exclusive. Blocks only is a nice way to spare some bandwidth to fullnodes, avoiding the exchange of not confirmed transactions. It's something that could help home nodes, saving both bandwidth and CPU power, for example; or business that needs to validate transactions but aren't interested in 'contributing to the network', etc.
Extreme Thinblocks instead greatly speedup the exchange of complete blocks, that is crucial to better blocks propagation. The Great Firewall of China comes to mind, which is a major problem. This could greatly help the basic infrastructure of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:50:57
Basically solves (or greatly reduce at least) the problem of blocks propagation.
This may just be almost game changing.
@_date: 2016-02-26 21:14:16
I see what you mean, but the lookup / matching with the mempool is very fast. I think that a DDoS with an "old style" raw big blocks serie would still be more demanding.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:32:16
I'm not familiar with Jaxx. Its way of managing the seed words may or may not comply with some standard, you should ask them or check the docs. But transferring with a Bitcoin transaction is obviously a foolproof method of accomplishing what you need. You could choose a very low fee, if you have the option, because obviously you don't need a high priority transaction.
@_date: 2016-02-07 11:35:09

From where are you sending? Inside Europe SEPA transfer take 1 day, but from outside it can take up to a week.
@_date: 2016-02-26 02:15:29
The option is the one I written above, "prune". Either you put it at the end of the command line that launch the node, or in the config file. So, if you are on Windows for example, just go on the property of the icon that you use to launch the node, and add  " -prune=550" to the end of the command line. If you are on Linux, probably just edit the ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf file and add a "prune=550" line.
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:53:02
If you enable pruning (for example: -prune=550), you still have to wait do download everything, but you can get away with 2-3GB of disk space. So, if maybe you are not comfortable with exporting / reimporting your keys, in this way you'll have to just wait a while and do nothing special.

Xtreme Thinblocks is a new experimental strategy to transimt blocks among nodes; basically only the transactions that aren't already present (and validated!) in the mempool are transmitted. It's way more efficient.

You basically can choose a discount, say 20%. You pay the discounted price in bitcoin, which are put in escrow, and someone other pay the full sum to get your bitcoins when the items are delivered to you. 
People who want bitcoins pay more for the convenience of getting them using a trusted platform and their usual means of payment.

Probably the best argument for small business is just free coverage.

Bitcoin.de seems to be very solid and well managed.
But still, there's basically no valid reason to leave bitcoins there for more time than the strict necessary. It's also not your typical exchange, so there's not even the usual reason of having bitcoins there to be "ready" for the right moment.

TREZOR is still open source - they rightly reverted the license change soon after.

Even with an hardware wallet, you will have to deal with a backup of the seed, and the requirements are similar: you have to have it, because the HW wallet can be lost, destroyed, etc.; and you have to protect it, because with the seed one can get all the bitcoins.

It's OK to reward yourself a bit, just don't compromise a big chunk. For example, it may seems difficult to sell some bitcoins to buy a new car, knowing that in x months/years it will be like if the car had costed you x-times the price. But, if you know that your remaining bitcoins has also appreciated x-times, it's not so bad.
Maybe you can set yourself a goal and go for it, like "I will buy this when I can buy it with x spare bitcoins".

Difficult to say, as it has many ramifications in both sectors. Like the internet.

It backup your address &amp; private keys (the address is the public part of your wallet, the private key is what enable you to spend the Bitcoins associated with that address), creating a PDF that you can print, share with trusted persons, sync in the cloud trough Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. The keys are protected with a password (so one cannot do anything with just the PDF) that it show one time, when it create the backup. You need to keep a note of that (writing it, or using any passowrd manager like for example Keepass). The nice thing is that it also let you verify the backup, so you know immediately if you have done and understood the steps. The verification consist on scanning the QR code of a private keys from the PDF / print, and entering the password. If it's all OK, it mean that you can lose or breake the phone and can use that backup &amp; password to recover all your Bitcoins.

I am using bitcoin.de, and it seems to me solid and well made, and it's around by a long time. I find the 2FA with Google Auth very handy. I have bought BTC 3 times, with no issues. Less than 1 day turn around from SEPA transfer. They ask for your bank account to make a very small deposit with a certain code, to verify that you own that account. There's also a safety period of 2 weeks from the first buy, before being able to withdraw. But you are still able to buy/sell BTC in that timeframe, and it's just as the start.

Got an email about a donation in this last days of the years, and since I had just finished following a couple of series of videos (one, incidentally, on Bitcoin), I decided to check if they supported Bitcoins for donations (found later that they announced this months ago).

It's not about profit. It's about magic. Mining magically transform electricity in money! If the electricity is free, the magic is good. Else, not so much; more of a blackish one.
