But once you spend those segwit utxo, core generates legacy change address by default. This needs to be solved first otherwise we will never get segwit adoption any time soon. Is there a way how to report such issues to devs?

So why dont people use it? is it because it is hard to use it?

Show me the proof please.

Stop blaiming those companies. They need to put higher fees since the network is unpredictable. if there are no blocks found for 45 min. tx sent with lof fees will remain unconfirmed for weeks. Do not blaim bitpay or coinbase. Ok they should imolement segwit, but it dies not solve much.

But if you run server you have no option left. Segwit took enormous time and it obviously failed

The problem is bigger than you think.  People are complaining about unpredictable network confirmation time. Tons of tickets of angry people.  I used to work with coin control feature in core which worked fine untill i switched to segwit. When spending segwit coins from core by using coin controll it calculates fee amount incorectly resulting in creating non segwit unspendable change address. So i am basically not able to create tx with single output anymore. 
Batching helps reduce the  size far more efectively than Sw. Maybe schnorr will help further more.  
Many utxo are basically economically unspendable and thats the real problem.

Sure it is not enough. If everage tx cost 20 usd, segwit makes it only 40% cheaper. Bitcoinpay is switching to LTC now since it is harder and harder to use btc as payment method.

Because merchant would need to swipe bitcoins anyway So what is the deal?

This thread is related to network fees charged by bitpay. I insist. This does not solve anything. Bitcoin is not usefull for payments anymore since network operates on max capacity.

 I am just saying that it is not enough even when you do proper batching use  segwit. You still endup roughly  between 3-5 usd/ utxo you may  try to send it with lower fees but there is high probability it gets stuck. 
Cryptoprocesors are slowly moving from bitcoin and users will follow.

Core needs to implement full support first. Dont blame those companies. Working with segwith with reference client is quite challenging. Change addreses stil uses legacy format etc.

No payment gateway remains 100% loyal to bitcoins under current circumstances - tx fees. Wake up. Bitcoin is loosing their dominance not because bch but because of inability to adopt to increased demand. Btc is becoming useles for e-commerce.
