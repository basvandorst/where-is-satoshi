Not when you are responding to something this illogical and moronic.
When someone says "we should stop tipping our waiters because of thunderstorms!" you don't have much of a choice other than to call them a moron and move on.
I mean, how would you respond to that? A detailed description on the meteorlogical conditions that are responsible for thunderstorms, then a description of what a thunderstorm actually is, followed by what it is not . . . before launching into a different explanation of supply and demand and the impact of education, unemployment and profit margins as applied to wages for waiters, followed by a historical overview of the practice of tipping and where it has evolved to today . . . only to realize that the moron you are responding to is too dumb to even care and will come back with some point like "they don't tip anyone in Bavaria!" or "not all thunderstorms produce hail!"
Waste of time.

Go on, give a situation where anyone would use Bitcoin when it had 0 value in real currency.
That's literally Monopoly Money at that point (actually less valuable, because you can't use it for kindling)
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:37:06

The answer is why he called you a moron. And why you *are* a moron.

Uh, something getting even more overpriced due to hype doesn't make it any less overpriced at an earlier point in time.
Don't get me wrong, I love you HODLers. I've flipped coins three times now and made enough real money to install a fireplace in my house this spring. You HODLers are keeping the bubble up and buying my coin at the peaks -- and I am very greatfuk.
If you are liquid enough to have these types of transactions pending, it's utterly fantastic and almost more fun than playing craps.

They were vaporware companies, mostly, not tied to an actual ability to generate profit and entirely focused on making stock available and then hoping that someone would pay more for that stick down the road.

I get all my financial advice from a short, naked man trapped in a playground. He says to keep investing in bitcoin. Gonna listen to him.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:36:25
Dude, everyone has had exposure. My dad doesn't even use email and wants to buy some bitcoin.
Similar to what things looked like right before the housing bubble popped, when everyone was pulling the trigger on housing investments. 
When grandmas and grandpas are investing, it's a sign that 1) it's too late to invest, and 2) bubble's gonna pop.

Average annual return for the S&amp;P since 1973 was 11.5%. For fuck's sake, pick any respectable dividend income index fund. 
Shit, just pick VIG.
EDIT: how clueless are you about actual investing? You realize Bitcoin is little more than a thought experiment/gambling opportunity, and not a real investment . . . right?
@_date: 2018-09-11 22:27:00
God damnit, my tax dollars are gonna be bailing you out too *sigh*
Compound interest on 100k over 40 years at an average rate of return and *without* reinvesting (or even getting) any dividends would give you a 10-fold increase in wealth. Increase the rate of return, reinvest dividends, or add to it, and that number skyrockets. The awesome power of compound interest.
Bitcoin is largely a joke, and if it ends up being scarce in the future *that'll mean nobody is using it for a currency.* If it (lol) ends up being real money someday, despite all it's flaws, everyone will have access to it. Behold  the awesome power of tulips, Beanie Babies, and pogs . . . 
And any crypto will work just as good as a currency at $10k per coin, or $1k, as at any price point. So . . . you do you, just be sure to thank us when we're spending our money to keep you alive *double sigh*
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:29:25
No, that's well *below* the average for the S&amp;P since 1973 (11.5%)

7% real return.

@_date: 2018-05-19 10:54:13


I'm not a licensed psychologist, but I think that if I was I would call what you're doing "projection."
Have you given any serious thought to what you are gonna do with your life if "banks," "fiat currencies," and "the financial system" never collapse? What is your plan if BTC never sees anything close to mass adoption and keeps an exchange rate around $6k-$7k? 
I'm scared that you can't even contemplate a non-apocalyptic future. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:02:26
It's already starting to look like $10k is the point where people say "no thanks" to BTC. 
It could function as a currency just fine at that point. Of course, right now it doesn't function as much of a currency at all, but the point stands. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:47:34
I've made . . . $25k or so? off of selling Bitcoin. After taxes. 
Remodeled my home by cashing in on Bitcoin.
Still own 4. Looking forward to cashing out if we ever get another bubble, and then buying back in when it inevitably plummets.
But I'm not an idiot and at this point I'm playing with house money. My real investments are in my 401(k) and my home.
Eventually the bubbles will stop coming, and *maybe* Bitcoin becomes something closer to a real currency. But even if it was adopted in a widespread basis and got stable, $10k per 1 BTC would be a perfectly acceptable price point for a functional currency.
I hope this cash pinata isn't your retirement plan.

@_date: 2018-05-24 10:52:31
But if you're doing this in the hope that Bitcoin is the currency of the future, why not just wait and use that money for a real investment?
If Bitcoin does gain acceptance, it'll be easy to obtain at that point. I mean, how hard is it to get USD right now?
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:17:20
Never sold?
Holy shit you are doing this dead wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:55:09

I've got over a million dollars invested that I assure you I cannot afford to lose.
When I go to Vegas, I only gamble with what I can afford to lose. I don't think you understand the difference between gambling and investing.

It's good for evading local laws (drugs, sex trafficking) and international laws (banking regulations, money laundering) but not so good for actually buying things, maintaining any sort of value, or providing return on investments. 
I actually prefer a paper trail for my purchases, and like it when places actually accept my currency, but hey -- you keep doing you!

you what now?
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:26:03
Sorry buddy, but Bitcoin is a thought experiment at best. 
Best case scenario is that it eventually maintains itself as a niche-use monetary system. 
At its most useful, it's a globe-spanning game of roulette where people can gamble in an entirely unregulated arena, ascribing real value to play money and watching the numbers go up and down.
At its most dangerous, you've got a subreddit full of bagholders who are convinced that Bitcoin is a solid "investment" and that they're on the cutting edge . . . when it reality, they are the same bagholders that speculative investments have been bamboozling for centuries. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 09:24:30
It's an interesting thought experiment aaannnnddd that's about it.
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:04:46
The retard levels are often through the roof in here. It's weird to see people who actually understand economics and governance chiming in.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:48:11
You're half-right!
It's like religion. Say, a Jehovah's Witness. Constantly trying to (mostly unsuccessfully) convert people for years, only to die of some easily-treatable ailment because their inability to understand fundamental concepts like blood transfusions led to their death.
That's Bitcoin! A mostly useless "currency" that's fun to gamble with but is no way a substitute for real money, or real investments.
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:45:08
So, you're saying I should use TA on roulette? On it!

You can't even answer a question you posed . . . 
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:31:21
You think common sense is *fear*?
The winners are the one's like us, who got out, and reinvested in profitable assets.
The losers have been "dollar cost averaging" (lol) all the way to the bottom, losing *more* money.
The biggest losers are the HODLers who could've found far better uses for their money this year, but apparently were not smart enough to pull out and just rebuy if it looked like things were turning around. 
You just don't bag hold a shitty speculative and volatile "investment," a lesson that a lot of poor kids are slowly learning the hadr way.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:27:08
Sell everything at 19k.
Rebuy at 6k.
That's what winning looks like.

The model establishes a price point where Bitcoin "works" as a currency.
Better question would be "why on earth would it go any higher?"
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:20:59
Again . . . That's just so wrong I have to conclude that you know nothing about poker or analogies.

So now *you* are saying that basic poker statistics (52 card deck, two hole cards, calculate % chance of winning hand) is comparable to a speculative "currency" and it's value, despite having literally no variables in common or any passing similarity at all?
I mean, shit, I can tell you the % chance of winning after 10,000 rolls on the craps table playing the pass line with max odds, but that has shit all to do with Bitcoin, other than that they are both gambling and not investing.

I like using the same currency I've always used to pay for literally everything I have ever bought or rented. 
I like receiving the same currency I've always used for services and goods I provide, and as returns on investments I have made.

@_date: 2018-02-02 23:54:34
Up 1000%? You must have sold a lot.
Still would have been way smarter to sell it all and then buy back after it bottoms out.
You're really bad at this.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:04:58
But some of us are thankful for the hodlers who didn't make anything, because it made it easier for us to cash out.

@_date: 2018-02-06 01:59:23
Answer me this: why do you think Bitcoin isn't gonna Enron crash into nothing, and never rise again?
Not gonna cite me a . . . chart, are you? It's not like Bitcoin has drastically bubbled up in over-value only to crash back down to reality in the past . . .has it? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:00:03
No, you are actually missing the point (lots of 'em).
1. Bitcoin isn't an investment, it's speculation/gambling. The "rules of thumb" for the two are *very* different.
2. "Buy at the bottom, sell at the top" is a "rule" for speculation that certainly assumes you do not have access to time travel. And if you get it exactly right, it was luck, not skill. *BUT* it's not too difficult to see when a speculative gamble like Bitcoin has topped out, or when it has bottomed out -- because it starts consistently going the other way.
"Buy low sell high" means everyone smart got the hell out at 16/17 k, and are gonna get back in waaay lower. Maybe this time it bottoms out at 2k, and then starts to climb, so I get back in at 4k. I'll have at least as much speculative Bitcoin as I had before -- but I am way more wealthy in real money than I was before. Same amount of Bitcoin, but a way better cost basis.
HODLing a speculative gamble is one of the stupidest things you can do. Not because time travel is impossible. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:58:50
What is stopping him from rebuying way cheaper when this garbage bottoms out (again)?
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:49:47
I do. And Western Union is a terrible option. There are many, many better choices.
Bitcoin, though, is actually worse than all of them for what yiu're describing. So maybe stop lying in an attempt to manufacture a use-case for a decade-old thought experiment than kinda fizzled.

I assume you agree to bet?
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:23:02
Oh, I'm not sure, that's a guess. Could go lower -- could bottom out higher. But the bottom is pretty easy to spot (just takes time).
Fact is that it's already plummeted 10k lower than it was. That's a crash that is well worth selling off for.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:13:11
When they tell you what you want to hear, they are always right.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:56:47
No. The goal is to take advantage of people like you and basically "day trade" the value of a currency that doesn't actually work like a real currency.
Only reason to buy more at the bottom of this crash is the expectation it will bubble again and give another opportunity to sell. No way I'd "hold" this shit.
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:55:27

2. It has a lot of people that don't know the first thing about investing providing all sorts of entertaining ideas about their version of dollar cost averaging, buying the dip, (bag)holding, price walls, how fiat currency is pretty much dead, government (versus personel) debt, deflationary currency, and how past performance dictates future trends!

I'll buy again after the crash, and have more bitcoin than you.
I'll sell in the next bubble and make even more bank, ditching everything as soon as it starts crashing.

I mean, just look at the price history for Facebook stock -- it's been flying to the moon, with a couple deep dips along the way. Fantastic investment (as long as you understand the underlying tech). And talk about mass-adoption!
Should have bought in back in 2012 when you could get it for $19 per share. I know I'm gonna buy a bunch of discounted Facebook stock now while I can!

Facebook is doubling-down on security, which will cut into profits, which drive share prices. 
A lot of people sold because they expected a lot of people to sell, with the intention of picking it back up once all those people sell.
It's how prices move when there is actual underlying value and information available to impact the price.

@_date: 2018-02-02 17:35:07




You did that on purpose, right? 
Pro-tip: cutting losses in speculative markets is the smartest thing you can do. The hole point is to hit big and cash out.
You buy at 5, watch it hit 15, and then watch it drop back down to 5. I buy at 5, sell at 10, and buy again at 5 . . . and wish I would have sold at 15.
Only one of us is doing it right in a speculative market (not you).

you're right in admitting that a quarter of the world's population uses Facebook. That's HUGE, established, and dominant. That's what you invest in long term.
BTC still has zero intrinsic value unless you want to sell drugs or pay ransoms. It's like betting on black 8 in roulette, because you "understand the underlying tech regarding gravity and inertia on little white balls" and really want your chip stack to dramatically increase with no effort on your part.

Hey, if it helps you sleep at night, you do you.
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:05:29
So you not only don't understand economics, but also don't understand what building materials cost and what property values are, do you?
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:14:37
You spent a lot of time just proving my point.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:47:11
That's the definition of weak hands. Weak hands and limp wrists never do well in speculative/gambling style markets like Bitcoin.
Pure profit taking by ditching all coin prior to this dramatic crash, then buying back in near/at the bottom . . . that's what those of us with Popeye forearms are doing. Making Bitcoin (and HODLers) our bitches, slipping off into the night, and then coming back later when everything fell apart to do it over again. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:57:37
Also, nobody really uses it. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:17:51
I am completely unsurprised at the fact that you absolutely fail to grasp the economic impact of having a quarter of the human population as a user base.
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:53:22
I once got three blackjacks in a row! I have a system!
@_date: 2018-04-01 09:56:20
And then the original "Bitcoin Economist" that prompted that response nuked his own post because of how savage that takedown really was.
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:34:25
But waaay easier to spend, while actually holding value.
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:31:44
And once the HODLs start declining, SELL!
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:40:32
Yes, call for genocide. That's the right idea.
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:01:57
Could just be one item per column.
Fiat: used for literally everything, including drugs.
Bitcoin: makes the clickbait press when it is used to buy a pizza. Legit good for buying drugs.
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:39:04
Hell yeah.
What this sub absolutely needs is to become an even bigger echo chamber.
That will be healthy!
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:04:34
You mean by sending a couple chicos to beat me into giving them my ~~private key~~ money clip?
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:56:06
If anyone bought at $200 and didn't sell yet they are a moron.
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:39:05
Shh bby
Everybody here just wants to feel smart and get free money. In that order.
Nothing you say will matter.
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:30:45
Bitcoin has always been about money for nothing.
It's easy to just sit there thinking about making money. And that's why does it -- just sitting there, rocking back and forth, thinking about making all that money.
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:09:58
Holy shit you're serious
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:38:24
You think a bubble makes Bitcoin sound?
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:40:13
Buyers remorse is not the same thing as a bubble.
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:37:34
He sounds poor as shit too.
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:52:06
Yes sweetie, Bitcoin went up before which means it's bound to go up again. Basically free money dear.
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:15:00
"Everything's fine."
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:48:59
It *really* sounds like you are talking about Bitcoin here!
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:33:35
Erm, to most people, it's actually the punchline to a silly joke.
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:41:35
Your cognitive dissidence is fucking terrifying. I'm just glad you don't have enough money to actually lose out big . . .
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:04:02
No . . . he's saying Bitcoin is little more than a thought-experiment that got a few people rich right before it failed to gain meaningful adoption. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:34:40
What makes you think I'm whining? 
Shit son, I *won*.
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:13:25
"Evidence of growth and interest" -- like being poised to gain significant adoption via widespread media coverage . . . only for the price to collapse when everyone realizes that Bitcoin as a currency is just a flawed thought experiment with next to no real-world use cases compared to what already works? When everyone sees that something touted as a "store of value" loses all its value, rapidly?
. . . yes sweetie. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:17:10
He didn't "name call" once.
Why am I not surprised that your reading comprehension sucks too . . .
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:41:21
How many nodes are you running?
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:29:48


@_date: 2018-12-13 23:58:16
Uh, how much business does Bitcoin actually do in a day.
Not getting bought-and-sold, but getting used as a real currency.
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:20:07
Most of us are just here because we made money during the bubble, were smart enough to sell, and just like laughing at the bagholders that hand around after every_single_bubble.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:58:43
Lol. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:11:51
I did. Still want to know what point you thought you were making.
But I think you just realized you didn't have a point either ��
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:22:04
I made *a lot* of money buying before the bubble and selling close to the ATH. 
But I was also smart enough to recognize the bubble, and cash out instead of bag holding. 
I know a lot more about Bitcoin then you, and *way* more about making money. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:27:18
Heh. Back when Bitcoin was at $10k USD, I bet 6 different shills on this sub Reddit gold that the price was gonna go below $5k before it ever reached $15k. 
Surprise surprise, they never paid up. You shills are all sadly the same.
Hey, wanna bet Reddit gold? I bet that this "store of value"  is gonna continue to drop below $2k before it ever hits $10k. What about you?
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:19:55
Lol I'm on track to retire in 5 years, 15 years early. A lot of that has to do with not being dumb enough to baghold bubble investments.
Please stay away from windows.
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:01:36
I mean, they matter a lot to short sellers -- if my math is right, the price of Bitcoin has been circling the drain for going on a year . . .
"Bitcoin casts 'store of value.' It's super ineffective!"
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:10:00
Whew lad, you're projecting harder than an IMAX theater here. That was . . . very, very specific and detailed.
@_date: 2018-12-04 03:20:43
1. What percentage of value can a currency lose in a month before it is considered a terrible "store of value?"
2. What percent of a given population needs to adopt something before it can be considered a real "currency."
Right now Dave &amp; Busters buck are a better store of value and more widely adopted currency than Bitcoin. Stop shilling.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:10:24
You think USD will be worthless in a few years . . . 
Yeah, i'm gonna be outliving you by a healthy margin.
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:16:15
Lol I was right ��
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:18:15
The fact that you are name calling tells me you are depressed. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:49:54
Why do you think? Some scrub shows up telling someone to waste time/resources "for the greater good," and 9 times out of 10 they are just a free loader who likes to talk.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:05:51
Slim to none. You got out at the right time. Well done ;)
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:56:52
Are both of you too stupid or lazy to simply look him up? His byline is right there at the top of the article

You . . . you don't know how to find and purchase dividend stocks?
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:59:38
To the vast majority of the human population, no.
I'll just settle for my wife, my kids, my family, my extended family, my friends, my employees, my clients, my colleagues, and and former/current mentees. 
And you'll always have your memes and worthless Bitcoin, which is . . . also nice, I guess?
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:15:03
God this sub is hillarious 
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:17:18
Or use a bank account with real money in it . . .
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:46:26
The fact that you're delusional (and projecting) is hardly surprising. It's been the standard MO for bag holders for decades (at least). 
I get that you have no rebuttal to the points I made regarding "currency" or "store of value," and now you're left with resorting to calling me "mad" *even though I am delighted that I made close to $40,000 on Bitcoin's bubble*, so maybe you really should stop responding. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:08:00
Your garbage post? 
What exactly was your reason for saying the "majority if stocks don't pay dividends" unless you were implying they were scarce or hard to find.
Seriously, explain the point you were trying to make. I bet it's facinating.
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:18:06
Cheap talk is the only reason this sub exists . . .
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:07:05
This is good for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:16:36
. . . Did you just quote the current price of Bitcoin while it's still in free-fall?
Lol "store of value"
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:04:03
When revolutions collapse in a catastrophic fashion . . . they failed.
Hate to *burst your bubble*

Nice try Bitcoin shill.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:37:17
You think most US debt is held by "foreigners?" 
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:27:58
No, seriously, did you?
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:46:16
That's right sweetie, I'm sure your Bitcoins will matter to somebody someday.
