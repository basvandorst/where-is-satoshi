Is that really beneficial to the cryptocurrency community though? To lose a group of people that have been known to spend more than Android users? The benefits Apple products will give the cryptocurrency community make it worth fighting for.

Ah, thanks for the info. I don't have an Android phone, nor do I plan on getting one, but if I were, I'd definitely look at this for a wallet.
Anyways, back to the topic at hand. I'm not sure if it'll be removed or not. It does some things differently from other wallet apps, so as far as I'm concerned, it's a toss up what Apple's going to do with it and when they're going to do it. I mean, they only just now removed Blockchain after a few years of it not being able to do transactions, so I'm not sure what's going to happen.

But not cross platform. I'm not looking at what's the best wallet period, I'm just looking at iOS solutions, which so far, few have come up with something that won't get their app removed. It looks like Verso has, though.
Besides, with Mycelium, what happens when you lose your phone? If it has a password, what happens when someone hacks it? With Verso, the app is useless without the card, the card is useless without the app, and both together are useless if they don't know your password. Those three factors make this highly secure. But then the question remains – how much do you care about the security?

It's upsetting because it seems that everyone is too quick to give up and not fight for what they believe in. Where's the drive? The will to make things work? If Google didn't allow wallets, would you be so quick to give up and not find a creative solution?Switching platforms, in my opinion, should be the last resort. What you do when you've run out of ideas. Now, where you say you've run out of ideas is a line you'll have to draw, but I would advise against drawing it too close in. Stretch the imagination, innovate your way out of the box. After all, is that not cryptocurrency was built upon?

Wait a minute, doesn't Gliph use P2P to do messaging?

Interesting. Do you have a source? (Apple App Store guidelines, etc.)

And I'm not suggesting Android users go out and buy an iPhone. People have their preferences and they are entitled to it. All I'm saying is that we shouldn't be giving up on Apple just yet.

Just need help with the format. I know how to cite, I just don't know how to cite a paper.
