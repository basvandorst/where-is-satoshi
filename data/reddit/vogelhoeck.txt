Give it a try! Whats the worst that could happen? A couple of smoke free days and teeny bit larger piece of the moonpie! :D

Great! Rooting for you, mate!

Thanks! I'll keep you posted! And yeah, it is something everyone should have a look at. Most of us have a vice or two that it is easy to save in on by skipping on a daily or weekly basis, either ciggs or that second Snickers bar. I draw the line in the sand by my friday sixpack, though. Mr. Satoshi will have to pry that from my cold, dead hands! ;)

Good question! Maybe someone else here has a tip? I use Coinbase and the fees are ridiculous for small transactions and make up quite a large chunk percentwise. My solution so far is to bulk up the tenner buy for 100 euros every ten days. Still pretty expensive, imo.

I keep a small percentage on exchange, enough to cover my initial investment + a little extra on a set stop loss. I see it as quick bailout money in case shit hits the fan, like the market collapsing or my car breaking down. The rest, which then is "free money" from all the gains, are locked down cold for a longer run.

Thanks mate! It's also a very cool learning experience. I would never have thought I was able to absorb so much interesting information about crypto, blockchain, global finances etc. in such a short time.
