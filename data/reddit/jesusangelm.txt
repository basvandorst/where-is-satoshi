thanks for the bitcoin!.
sadly [changetip has blocked to venezuela]( i had to use a VPN for Withdraw.
I am a web developer, the company where i work, It has bitcoin payment option, I have been tempted to seek payment for bitcoin, but I'm not entirely sure.
in the last months I have seen a lot of movement in the bitcoin market in Venezuela:
* Xapo now sells bitcoins for bolivares.
* cryptobuyers offers a debit card funded by bitcoin and exchange bitcoins for bolivares.
