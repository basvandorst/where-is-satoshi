"Dear Mr Vermillion

No idea, I don’t really care about party politics. Left vs right, dems vs republicans, tribalism, it’s all a fucking joke. The elites pit the people against each other and laugh, they profit either way.

Yea maybe, but realistically neither of us have the access to know who they really are and if that’s really true

You cant seriously expect them to start talking about conviction right now. He’s not even charged with anything.
Edit: he also doesn’t need to break a law to be impeached
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:53:37
GOP candidates are, and they need to maintain a majority in order for Trump to not get impeached, so Russia and Trump are still motivated to hack the elections

You're so aggressive and angry, you should try smoking weed, it's pretty chill. Have a good one, good luck with everything.
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:01:08
k anyway, have a good one

Oh wow, he predicted bitcoin would dip??? He must have Marty McFly’s almanac.

I’m not talking about the shills and puppets, I’m talking about the true elitists, the ones we never see. The puppeteers who pull the strings, we don’t know much about them at all. We got a tiny sliver of the whole picture, we feel informed but really were in the dark.

Very likely run by Russians, using the scammed money to fund the hacking of the midterms for Trump. So, at least they’re being transparent.

Don't worry about it, Fox News will tuck you in at night

You're so classy, must be a Trumpist. You make the best jokes, everybody says so. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 04:48:18
Agreed. We can argue about left/right values and dem vs republican talking points, but that plays well for them. We can agree on this though, and that unifies us against the true power that is working to control us. This is what all of us should be focusing on.
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:52:19
I’m not joking, it just sounds like a joke because it sounds unbelievable 
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:30:49
Bitcoin has plenty politics of its own to deal with

Looks like something from the 90s. That’s a good since... we’re only in the early day!
