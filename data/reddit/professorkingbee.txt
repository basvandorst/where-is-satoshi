You can purchase with a Debit card after KYC documents are approved. For a credit card I would use Kucoin to purchase. keep in mind the credit card companies charge you a cash withdrawal fee on that money.

Cash App CEO is the same as Twitter's CEO. Due to the bottom falling out of coinbase more users are looking for other ways to buy BTC. The Cash App is actually pretty awesome for buying and instantly transferring BTC. No waiting for YOUR money.!
