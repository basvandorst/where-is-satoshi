Yes, these are not for everyone I realize. My target audience is the serious collector who is looking to own a commemorative part of a super rare supply precious metal crypto-tribute proof, only 50 created. Also, there is more than just the silver content here. For this small batch run coining dies had to be created, privatekey/address association done, private key insertion, holograms purchases, designated offline computer equipment for key security, custom stamped presentation case, custom stamped paper sleeve for presentation case and an official embossed Certificate of Authenticity for each.

Still 4 of these beauties available at the discounted rate :)

1. Orlando, FL, USA
2. I am a registered LLC that has been around for 6 months. My business model depends on establishing and maintaining trust. Not a lot I can say here other than this.
3. I will have to inquire with the manufacturer but each proof is enclosed in an airtight plastic seal which is then protected in the presentation case (leatherette). As long as the proof is kept in its housing, there should be no issue of fading.
4. Yes and also on Peercointalk (my original line was for Primecoin). You can find me on those outlets by searching my user name finitebydesign on BCT and finitebydesign.net on PCT.

Yes, they are available at my webstore:

Looks like 74% upvotes on the design - I think that is pretty good (3 out of 4 like it). Thank you all for the feedback and discussion!
@_date: 2015-03-07 16:27:31
@_date: 2015-03-07 12:21:05
Can always verify via the blockchain. By US law, I cannot find them sadly.
@_date: 2015-03-07 21:14:49
Clever scam, make 50 Bitcoins in the 1/10th BTC denomination, go through the hassle of marketing and selling them, wait for the purchaser to load them and then steal the loaded funds to walk away with 5 BTC! Pretty smart of me right? 
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:03:10
Yes, I like that design. After I clear out inventory, I will look into this.
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:52:15
There is a private key but must be customer funded per US regulations.
@_date: 2015-03-08 10:17:55
Thanks everyone, 76% upvoted! Can't please everyone and 3 out of 4 is pretty good :)
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:36:13
Any Bitcoin client will work.
@_date: 2015-03-17 15:35:09
Thanks for the heads-up then. I am going to shut this down until I can do some further research and confirm legality. Apologies to all.

My pic doesn't quite do them justice, some nicer ones on their website. They are a pleasure to deal with and for the collector, they do have limited edition rolls of 40 pennies (only 20 made for 2015).
@_date: 2015-03-15 11:35:27
Nice! What material is that? Are those for sale? Why did you opt to go without the hologram/private key option? Sorry for the twenty questions, just an exciting subject matter for me - you too hopefully :)
@_date: 2015-03-04 14:52:02
that makes sense. i know most (myself included) like black for its slimming ability, but my kid doesnt have fur lol
@_date: 2015-03-28 08:37:28
Are you in the US? I am and mine came in 2 days. I would suggest reaching out to them - Christopher there is very responsive and helpful, a pleasure to deal with imho.
@_date: 2015-03-04 20:11:34
The shirts are $20 and made through Customink. Not sure where you purchased $4 shirts, but I am confident the quality was that of a $4 shirt. There is about an $8 markup on these since I am the one that ordered the bulk quantity out of pocket. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 16:20:38
Yes, will be adding more products in time. I guess you are looking for something more along the line of my nickel or copper doge coins, but for Bitcoin?

Northwest Territorial Mint

I am aware of and understand BIP38 and I did not make Titan Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:47:05
Sorry, don't understand. You mean to the website?
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:41:17
Good luck with your business model.
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:07:19
Good news then 
@_date: 2015-03-07 17:55:43
Much appreciated :)
@_date: 2015-03-04 20:54:45
That is indeed the best way! 
I made the design and used a third party. Just made a few of them because I wanted one for myself and figured others would as well. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 10:46:44
Lol, honestly had never thought of that but I get it.
@_date: 2015-03-05 10:45:49
So much unknown about Satoshi, this is what makes speculation so interesting. I hope we never find out personally.
@_date: 2015-03-07 12:18:56
This is the only denomination, only 50 made. I have some other physical crypto but that's the only Bitcoin one. And yes, that is the website.
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:42:18
additional detail:
I saw an interesting story on the news last night that led me to an idea for a coin sale / lottery / contest. Here is how it works, I have a 1 troy ounce .999 fine silver '1/10th Bitcoin' proof (unloaded) which I will sell to someone for 0.01BTC (less than $3) and I will cover shipping. The catch is that I will allow multiple buyers for this piece but only one of them will actually 'win' and buy it, similar to a lottery format. I will accept entries for this piece through this week and weekend and randomly draw a winner at 9am EST on Monday, March 23rd. I will not allow more than 50 entries so the worst odds possible to win with one entry is 2%.
If you want to enter for the chance to buy this piece for 0.01BTC, then follow the below steps:
1) Send your 0.01BTC payment to 17TT2EjDZJSLzUXvKk12ykqeMzhyCw4fp5
2) Post your transaction number to the thread on Bitcointalk
3) Wait until 9am EST on Monday, March 23rd to see if you are selected as the winner.
Thats it. 
Here is some additional detail on the prize up for sale:
Limited mint, .999 Fine Silver Crypto-Proofs
Each line of 1 Troy Ounce .999 Fine Silver Crytpo-Proofs is from a limited batch of only 50 pieces. Included with each proof is:
- An associated address for customer funding
- A security hologram on the rear of the piece concealing a private key for redemption of customer loaded funds
- A protective plastic capsule encasing the proof
- A custom stamped leatherette presentation case
- An f*D embossed Certificate of Authenticity confirming the proof as one of the limited line of 50
- A custom stamped paper sleeve for housing of the presentation case and proof 
@_date: 2015-03-07 16:02:31
Sure, you can order through my website 
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:37:15
That is the suggested amount to be funded by the customer.
@_date: 2015-03-07 16:06:00
This is actual silver. Silver is plentiful, there are only 50 of these. Not for everyone, no - this is a niche item for certain collectors.
@_date: 2015-03-17 14:52:04
Lol, at least you got the math!
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:16:50
If not funded it has the value of the 1 Troy ounce of .999 fine silver plus whatever other value attributed for being 1 of a limited batch of 50 made.
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:21:41
Lol 
Did you have a suggestion? 
@_date: 2015-03-17 15:40:56
Good looking out, I do appreciate it. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-04 15:02:08
what if it had a picture of a Penny?
@_date: 2015-03-07 12:00:47
Yes, on the Certificate of Authenticity that comes with them in the presentation case. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 14:29:41
Will keep this in mind, thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-07 16:13:03
You cannot add funds to that coin and there is no limit to how many will be minted. Remember, these are from a batch of only 50 pieces and come with the private key, presentation case, etc. All of the overhead had to be obsorbed by the 50 pieces. My cost all in is about $50 each. The $25 markup is for labor and a little profit.
@_date: 2015-03-15 12:18:47
Thank you kindly :)
@_date: 2015-03-17 14:29:02
Lol, you are correct. What I meant is that the physical piece is identified as '1/10th Bitcoin' designed to be funded by the customer when they purchase the piece. Entry for the giveaway contest is 1/100th of a Bitcoin or 0.01 (about $3). Hope this clarifies. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:24:47
Just a personal choice really but same result :)
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:11:13
Outsiders would probably say WTF is satoshi as well though.
@_date: 2015-03-15 12:09:28
I like that too.
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:56:06
Limited collectable that merges precious metal with crypto.
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:08:37
There will be a hologram for the back :)
More detail is on my website FiniteByDesign.net
@_date: 2015-03-07 12:38:50
The hologram has a matching number to correspond with the stamped number on the embossed C of A.
Edit: to clarify the stamp
@_date: 2015-03-07 16:50:06
Just my word and the fact that my business model depends on it.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:45:15
The coins were manufactured at Northwest Territorial Mint  and they are stamped .999 fine silver on the opposite side of the coin from the 1 troy ounce (its covered in the image I have provided). The coins are sold as DIY so the customer is responsible for creating their own private key and assembly. If someone were to want a special order with BIP38, we could discuss this but there would be a surcharge and I prefer not to tbh.
