From reading that I believe they showed that they have security measures and procedures to control the flow of coins out of their cold wallet and they have a detailed internal reporting system on their coins. But they have yet to prove publicly, that they have enough coins to cover all users and that your coins are included.
But until they can prove that the audit done by Antonopoulos serves to re-assure their customers that they are not completely clueless about how to run an exchange.

I just got the bundle. There is a .dmg download for all the games except Giana Sisters. Though it may not be available on steam.

If you are really worried about security Google auth is not as secure as this card. But the difference is minimal.

I was excited when I saw that it was a smart card but alas its not what I expected. 
I was hoping the private key was stored in the card and the card it's self is used to sign the transaction. Each terminal would send a transaction to the card and it would sign it and send it back to the terminal to broadcast then your receipt could contain the transaction ID. This would be easier and slightly faster then scanning a QR code from your phone.
Instead it looks like it is just storing your userID to point to their servers.

Now if only I decided before yesterday to setup accounts and buy some coins. Still waiting to be verified.

4 factor:
* Something you know: Password, passphrase
* Something you have: SMS, Google Auth, Yubikey
* Something you are: Fingerprint, facial recognition, Iris scan
* Somewhere you are: Computer id, current IP address

I have been following bit-coin for a while now. But just yesterday decided to join in the community. My wallet is currently empty but I hope to change that.... once Coinbase or Mtgrox get setup with my bank. 
I do have ideas on creating a swear jar using a raspberry pi. If that goes well I can set it up for other micro payments, beer/pizza jar. The possibilities are endless what the currency can do that couldn't be done before.

This is a great tutorial. Going to get a second sd card to use this along side my RaspBMC install.

I am still skeptical. I would rather have the smart card contain the private key. Would let the POS submit a transaction to the card to sign. The wiki already has a page about this: 
The disadvantage would be for CoinKite. They wouldn't be able to charge fees on transactions but only on the terminals and issuing of cards.

Expanding on my idea from yesterday I just registered bitjar.net with name cheap to document my project. Paid in full with bitcoins. Lets see where this goes.

Just because the key is on the card doesn't mean it can not be backed up anywhere else. And the user does not need to trust a third party to store and secure their keys.
For example if the key is loaded onto the card, into protected rom, from a secure computer, multiple cards could be loaded with the same key or even printed versions created.

Oh no. but it gives me a reason to save. But I might also do something like every time i fail/die in a game. Its more a reason to save then anything else.

I am hoping newegg supports bitcoin soon as I want to rebuild my rig next year.

I would take it a step further by eliminating the hundredths digit of cash, and maybe electronic, transactions.
