If anyone hasn't read the post from Variety Jones about being hunted they should. Bullshit or not its a great read

As previously mentioned i was mining for two Chinese pools and therefore contributing to their hashrate but my Antminers were here in the UK. Anyone remember when Ghash was the largest pool and came close to 50%? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:03:29
The graph just covers transactions hitting the blockchain. Changetip, Coinbase etc do a great deal off chain and others on here can probably list half a dozen more companies that operate like that. Anyone want to guestimate the number of transactions per day including off chain? 
@_date: 2015-12-07 00:30:26
Just noticed you mentioned the Ghash thing. People will swap pools if they deem it necessary. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:53:35
Might turn my Antminer S1 on to take us over the line

I read somewhere that the higher your levels of testosterone the more risks you are likely to take generally.  Might explain things a little as bitcoin is a risky investment

Would be better for the film if it was the drunk guy in the wheelchair with a shooter in one hand and a USB stick in the other

Its hit 850,000,000 according to:
Looks like we will see 1 Exahash (?) before 2016...

Also interesting that mens testosterone levels spike by about 45% a week after an orgasm so we are vulnerable then to putting stupid amounts of our savings into bitcoin like me. Some may call it stupidity but i call it shagging my way to the moon

Cool. If you fancy another night there let me know

1 might be enough if they cold storage the shit out of it for a decade or two

Last time i checked a Satoshi was 0.00000001 
@_date: 2015-12-13 20:21:05
As someone already mentioned you should buy and store rather than mine
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:15:16
If we combine all lost, destroyed and Satoshis coins there will probably only be 18-19 million left tops come the year 2140. Is that a reasonable assumption? Assuming Satoshi doesn't decide to use his of course

I'm up to my eyes in bitcoin. Can't walk 3 feet in my house without tripping over the damn things!!

People are nuts bro
@_date: 2015-12-12 03:28:17
Bitpay have confirmed this several times. During price spikes people will start spending. It also gets the attention of new merchants 
@_date: 2015-12-16 23:24:22
I think the argument is that there already is a fee market for confirmation speed. Miners dont need to rely only on fees for many years to come but fees should rise anyway as the userbase grows with people wanting fast confirmation times
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:18:12
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:12:05
I would probably use a combination of Shapeshift, paper wallets generated offline, Joinmarket and Coinkite via tor. I bought a light bulb the other day with bitcoin but its probably not worth trying to hide that from the NSA 
@_date: 2015-12-20 11:24:34
Good point
@_date: 2015-12-19 20:01:05
I believe this is correct
@_date: 2015-12-13 20:16:57
And then dry off your soggy toast in the oven which is also mining and securing the bitcoin network
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:09:46
Why are they doing this? I stopped using their service and this was the main reason.

That was a pretty cool piece from the BBC about bitcoin

Hi Chris, i'm leaving Nottingham tomorrow so will pop in for another few drinks later if i can. I have to leave because everyones kicking off about the 1mb blocksize and those blocks are mostly being filled by me on the piss haha :)
@_date: 2015-12-07 14:33:02
So the data trail stops at a certain address when following the movement of funds through a block explorer?

Hashrate is still increasing but difficulty hasn't caught up
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:25:24
Don't know why but when i try to visualize this i imagine a cashier at a commercial bank sat in front of a wall of screaming Antminers sweating like buggery and pushing notes under the glass to me
@_date: 2016-01-29 00:38:16
I'm selling but only because i've run out of shitty fiat and lost my job. It's motivated me more to find work asap though as i don't want to sell anymore of my hodl 
@_date: 2016-01-22 20:20:47
Yes they can help themselves and everyone else by stating their intentions rather than leaving people guessing and often assuming the worst
@_date: 2016-01-24 05:31:58
Very good point

Blame Canada! Blame Canada! It seems that Bitcoin's gone wrong since Canada came along! Blame Canada!

* 2mb
* Segwit
* Confidential Transactions
* Lightning Network 
Thanks :)
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:58:19
Good time to buy imo 
@_date: 2016-01-15 00:52:56
Nobody really knows and the only way i think we'd find out is if another Ghash situation occured 
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:38:36
There has to be enough mining of the settlement layer though or Lightning is f*****d. Say LN was deployed in Q3 but blocks are full, fees are higher, and confirmation times slow...who will be using LN? Its in Blockstream's interest for bitcoin as we know it now to remain healthy for LN to fuction at all
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:59:47
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:09:54
We need more capacity for bitcoin the settlement layer and to keep transaction fees down whilst the block rewards are still relatively high. Seg Wit is going to enable some amazing things but i think its time to grow some balls and do a hard fork
@_date: 2016-01-20 11:18:27
Lightning requires on chain transactions and nobody will use it if the fees are high and it takes ages to get the first confirmation
@_date: 2016-01-19 21:42:49
Could be wrong but i think they tried to patent lots of things including multi-sig
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:17:24
Thousands have come and gone but you couldn't add new features and improvements the way you can bitcoin. Bitcoin is more like an evolving organism with no centre which makes it unique. I do agree though that something will replace it but right now it is the most secure and robust platform for currency etc by far
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:08:09
You should be flappy head!
@_date: 2016-01-20 11:26:22
Me too. She'd also have to write down questions on a piece of paper and hold them up to the glass due to the noise coming from the ridiculous ASIC rig
@_date: 2016-01-19 20:49:33
What are weak blocks? I've seen them mentioned before but don't really understand them
@_date: 2016-01-30 03:36:59
Just want to echo Erik here. I'm no expert but i can see how positive it would be for the industry if Core set a blocksize HF date in their roadmap. I think it would bring people together and act as a catalyst for everyone to get behind SegWit and the great work been done by the core devs to enhance this technology. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:00:45
We could handle millions of transactions a day with the current hashrate, the problem is storage and bandwidth 
@_date: 2016-01-19 21:45:00
* hugely exaggerated

If bitcoin keeps creating jobs would governments still attack the network with the risk of getting caught? Some would some wouldn't i guess. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 22:46:38
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:15:20
Not sure why but i can't see Roger Ver selling his stash to central banks and he's rolling in bitcoin. I imagine there are many other individuals who are swimming in bitcoin too who also wouldn't. I guess governments could start buying up but that demand would raise the price and we'd be catapulted on to the moon. Fine by me actually

We will be back to Robin Hood times after that. Criminals carting around old chests full of gold coins
