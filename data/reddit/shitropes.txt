Damn... I did the complete opposite.  Bought a $30k shitshack that I paid off in 4 years. No plans to ever move.

They are years ahead of the west. Give us a few years and we'll be as safe as the Chinese.

Good luck with that. You're going to leave an easy to follow trail. Maybe not easy enough for a layman to follow, but trivial for law enforcement.

The only way to get criminals and terrorists to use bitcoin is to convince them that it will be beneficial to them.
Bitcoin would be the greatest tool for law enforcement.  I see it kind of like injecting dye into the bloodstream before taking an x-ray.  Donate some bitcoin to a known terrorist sympathizer and see where it goes.
The only problem is most criminals aren't that stupid.  Saying bitcoin is anonymous is like saying driving a car is anonymous just because your name isn't on the license plate.

At $1 million/btc there would be about $1.3 trillion/year of dilution going to miners, meaning almost that much going to power companies, which, at $0.1/kWh would be roughly half of the world's energy production. 
So I'm going to go ahead and say $1million/btc is never going to happen.

Well if you thought the price of bitcoin was going to drop you could use shapeshift to trade them for bitusd and then if you wanted to buy something with bitcoin you could just use shapeshift to go the other way. 
You're only trusting shapeshift for the few seconds between sending the bitcoins and receiving the bitusd. Bitusd is pegged to USD but is stored on a blockchain.

Where is the t-rex price feed?
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:27:53
I am not following you. Why would you have an exchange account. 
Shapeshift could also be used as a replacement for bitpay. Instead of merchants accepting bitcoin and instantly converting to USD they could convert to bitUSD (or nubits) to escape price volatility, yet they would still be in a cryptocurrency. Useful for unbanked and the like.

Back in the good old days you could deposit up to $10k cash without any ID or verification whatsoever at cavirtex. Not so much anymore. 
Debit costs $25 at cavirtex, which is unfortunate, it was $2.50 at vos. 
Cavirtex is only looking to build barriers to entry to make money, more so than spread adoption, I believe. 
Circle is crazy expensive for Canadians. Maybe a better credit card would be cheaper, I don't know. 
I think with quickbt you can become a pro after a few transactions which will increase your limit by a lot, but the fees are hefty. 
There really aren't any good options for Canadians anymore. Open bazaar might be promising.

But law enforcement has to go through the charade of getting a warrent to watch your bank account. No such roadblocks to watching you on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:06:51
I am sure there are dozens of ways but right off the top of my head I would think a good start would be in much the same way people are deanonomized on tor with traffic analysis. With tor if you can see somebody access 1.2 KB of data from a website and then you see 1.2 KB of data going from an ISP to your IP address you can be pretty sure who it was looking at that website. Change KB of data to $ value. This is an oversimplification but to think that you won't leave a trail is just naive. 
Of course an easier method would be for law enforcement to run the mixers or exchanges.  I think the term is honeypot. 
The bottom line is they have more money, more people, more brains and if they want to follow the money, they will follow the money. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:43:06
Well, then you will end up with 3X as many bitshares as you started off with anyway. 
I don't see how your comment implies locks are any safer. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:18:00
Why would you be interested in tether? If you want a currency pegged to the dollar look into bitUSD. Or if you prefer, look into bitGold or bitSilver.
Bitshares is decentralized, tether, bitreseve, coinapoult, etc are not. You can earn interest on bitassets, not on the others. 
I believe success of bitshares will lead to more success for bitcoin and vice versa. 
Tether has kyc nonsense, you may as well just keep your money in the bank.

Yes this is true for anone time tumbling. But I was referring to repeated criminal behaviour. Wipe the prints off the car and ditch it, but then do the sa!e with the next ten. Eventually you are going to have a lot of ditched cars around and odds are you'll screw up and the whole network will be revealed. 
Investigators can take their time and can watch more than the one transaction, wait for a pattern to appear. 
As for the stolen car analogy, it is slightly different in that they know when the car was stolen and only so manyncars can be stolen at one time. (Only so many people use a mixer at one time)
The possibilities to be deanonymized are endless. What is believed to be safe today will have a vulnerability found tomorrow. Remember how shared send used to be considered mixing?
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:32:42
Yes but everybody knows that banks aren't private. It seems that it would behoove law enforcement to push the myth of bitcoin being anonymous, because nobody is under the illusion that they can be anonymous with their HSBC accounts unless they are dealing in billions of dollars. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:12:14
It seems better than coinapult or bitreserve. The 300% collateral with the bitassets seems to work. Sure there are risks, and it is a young and illiquid market, but I feel it is more in line with the bitcoim communities demand for decentralization and trustlessness. 
You have to trust coinapult which means you have to trust panama which means you have to trust the us not to invade again whereas with bitusd you can see the 300% collateral on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:46:05
Still not following why I would need an exchange account. In fact, I used shapeshift today and didn't use an exchange account. 
As for building an alternative to bitpay, I think they already did:
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:15:10
Increasing difficulty but also increasing suspicion. The use of a tumbler would be a red flag that would bring in more investigation. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:33:35
bitUSD which is a bitasset.  Bitshares.  You even earn interest.
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:53:16
Team Lawsky, world police?
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:06:33
I am a little surprised at the willingness of the bitcoin community to overlook counterparty risk and embrace a centralized solution when decentralized options exist.

For every opinion on the internet, there is an opposite opinion as well.

Oh, so it would only be a quarter of world electricity production after 2016 till 2020.

What is a t-rex worth? I would say yes to the 747 though.

Of course the holders of the iou's for those coins would deserve the consequences for not taking ownership of their coins.
Although I think that the chances of 2-3 exchanges having more than 50% of any coin are a lot less than the chances of 2-3 mining pools having more than 50% of the hash power.
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:19:18
windows 3.1 is like counterparty.
Etherium is linux (?)
BitShares is MacOS
most of the others are just cheap msdos ripoffs.
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:19:05


Fair enough, but I dare say it's still 1992 in this analogy.
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:34:12
but if nobody used msdos then there never would have been an incentive to write software for it as nobody would buy or use the software.  
I have played around with many analogies for bitcoin over the years and am currently liking the os comparison.  I think of bitcoin as the msdos of cryptocurrencies. The 640k barrier is like the block limit.  Eventually Windows 3.1 will come out (I don't know what it will be yet).  Mac, Linux, etc.
Did anyone ever think that OS's would stop at MSDOS?  I don't really understand why people think there will only ever be one cryptocurrency to rule them all.  When something better comes along people will move to that.
If I remember correctly, the 640k barrier was never overcome by msdos.  There were workarounds, but it was still there.  
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:33:34
640 kB ought to be enough for anybody
@_date: 2015-04-15 13:04:45
there is nothing logical about my fallacies.
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:27:15
I don't see how it is in any way feasible.
There would be no chance whatsoever of ever reaching consensus on that.
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:40:44
The only 'altcoin' I have any interest in is BitShares.  Mostly because of the idea of treating the blockchain like a company, instead of calling the tokens coins they're shares.  Instead of the inflation going to pay power bills it helps to fund development.  Pegged assets.  The volatility of bitcoin has been a pain in the ass for adoption.  Having tokens - bitassets tied to gold or USD, or anything seems like a great idea.  DPOS makes me feel like I have a say on what goes on with the company.
Going with the company analogy, bitshares isn't really open for business yet.
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:35:51
the network of msdos users grew steadily... Till it started to decline.
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:52:01
I'm not so sure about the integration. Seemingly tiny changes seem incredibly controversial:
It feels to me like there are a lot of things that are just easier to achieve by starting from scratch, rather than trying to change something worth $3 billion and hope for the best.
It feels like sidechains are like trying to plug a usb device into an msdos machine. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 03:54:43
it is 225.581 bits.
Any time you shuffle a deck of cards it is a combination that has never existed before.
A 12 word electrum seed has 128 bits of entropy and is considered plenty.
Oh yeah and that doesn't include jokers.
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:54:31
go to brainwallet tab
flip coin 256 times, type in 'h' for heads and 't' for tails.
much easier would be a well shuffled deck of cards, type 'ks,ah,2c...' 
You can even leave the cards in that order for a backup.
