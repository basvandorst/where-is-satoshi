The main reason to run a node is for yourself, so you don't have to trust third parties when making transactions, and so you have control over which consensus rules to enforce and follow, making sure hostile fork attempts like 2X won't affect you.
If you want to run a node primarily to support the network, then bandwidth and uptime are the main factors. Also make sure your ports are reachable so other nodes can connect to you, otherwise it's pretty pointless.

We've already won all objective arguments. Exposing the scammers behind Bcash is more fun too.

Please don't add to the confusion by calling it bitcoin cash. It's called bcash.

Yeah you got scammed. Your friend is bullshitting you, because that's what scammers do. Report everything to the police and tell other victims to  do the same.

Shitcoiner idiots even downvoting you.
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:39:43
You should report your friend to the police if you haven't done so already. Also you most likely won't be able to gain any useful insight from "back tracking" the transactions, don't waste your time with this.

Fun fact: the 0.15.1 release was planned to bring full Segwit support in the wallet, but it had to be postponed because the devs had to deal with the more immediate problem of mitigating the potential issues introduced by the reckless 2X fork implementation.

It's part of the new transaction format. Core also sets a locktime for legacy transactions by the way, but simply sets it to 1 instead so it's always valid.

Can we pick the randon number on my computer?
@_date: 2019-02-07 09:46:52
But if we're talking about number of transactions, then transaction batching means a larger average transaction size. How does this contribute to lower fees at the same number of transactions? If anything it should have the opposite effect.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:48:24
Dynamic block sizes by default have to be assumed to be exploitable. Unless you come up with a formal proof that your approach would not be exploitable in any way, it's nothing but another random idea.

Running a node isn't necessarily some altruistic contribution to the network. I run a node because I don't want to trust anyone else's node when making/receiving transactions, and for no other reason. There are some high bandwidth nodes of course which are making large contributions by seeding the blockchain to new nodes.

Right conclusion, still the wrong reasoning. The "highest accumulated proof of  work" is not the what distinguishes Bitcoin from an altcoin. The highest accumulated proof of work is what distinguishes the valid Bitcoin chain from invalid/orphaned Bitcoin chains. But Eric the idiot will probably never understand this.

Very well put. If only more people would understand this. Unfortunately most people seem to think that an altcoin having faster block times is some awesome innovation, while it's actually just a security trade-off. The same applies to the blocksize.

Not a double standard at all. One is a voting type of consensus, where people use their freedom to use one chain over the other. The other is an abuse of a position of power to exclude others from the process of creating a consensus change (which has to be accepted by the users, because again, they are free to choose). 
The way Garzik handles this is symptomatic for everything the NYA crowd stands for.

@_date: 2017-07-09 05:24:21
There is no such thing as "the mempool". Every node has its own mempool, mostly based on its [Minimum Relay Fee]( setting. Every tx below that minrelayfee value will be dropped from the node's mempool.
So if the node behind jochen-hoenicke.de has a higher minimum fee requirement than other nodes, then that does NOT mean that "the mempool" is empty. Not at all.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:24:07

2. Force your hardfork on users by not providing any protection mechanisms for your fork, and put users at risk to get your way.
