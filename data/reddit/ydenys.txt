done, and will definitely use.

Am i the only one who thinks that with all the recent good news the price is artificially held in check because someone hasn't done all his buying yet?
@_date: 2014-05-29 23:28:39
Pathetic. Not even worth starting my chainsaw. I’ll leave it to my cat…

Nice write up. Thanks. 1 ubits (sorry that's all I have left there)

Meh, tips are better then 'gold'.
Edit: Thank you. (:
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:15:02
May I just ask kindly to give people time to deal with it… There is no point to rush/heat such events with speculation and premature condolences. Any off-hand comment you post now may cause serious harm to someone. TIA.
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:55:03
Meh, too late...

If I remember correctly Theymos had asked select members of the community to hold donated Bitcoins for the forum site. Did it not go through? If you attempt such accusations, please have the facts to support it available.
There was some grumbling about not updating bitcointalk’s face to everyone’s liking, but it was demonstrated upon subsequent DDoS attacks that the hardware/inner DB workings had some crucial work done to them. Since every second poster here is a brilliant web developer why not put a public request to tender with a clear offer/bid for your services to be approved by users - i’m sure Theymos would not be able to say ‘no’ to a winning proposal.

I'm in the UK, just sighed up, and you currently give at least half as much discount as Flubit (not Bitcoin-related Amazon discount proxy, very popular here). Stupendous!
Just making the list now... :)

RBS bought HBOS? What? Am I the only one seeing this? 'forced into a merger' even. Lloyds chairman practically begged CC to buy HBOS shares at 2x+ value. Whoever wrote it is a prized idiot regardless of the rest of the 'article'...

Wow. Just look at their homepage - 
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:05:46
No bitcoin payment option for the UK (all international orders) yet, but customer support stated it is coming soon??? Maybe UK only...
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:15:18
Also those disclosing their losses - do tell it to a friend instead…
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:43:39
I find it more fulfilling to tip artists/modders/developers whose work i actually use/enjoy (just ask on Nexus/Deviant/etc.) and who appreciate your tip. Plus it spreads the adoption within correct crowd.
Tipping celebs is akin to tossing a pig off the roof in hope it will fly.., but far less fun.

Keep begging posts off the first page please.

“I’m sorry, sir, it seems your arse has run out of Bitcoins…”
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:56:33
Well, quite a statement… Gox’s business is pretty much destroyed and dropping value by the hour. Unless it is some sort of insider/government-ish takeover manipulation i’m afraid it is just a question of how thoroughly they’ve cleaned up the house by now. Members of staff are always the weakest point along with data storage.
And since there was no ‘leaks’ of any kind yet plus overall BTC value is holding so well - care to jump on this thought train...?
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:06:54
Hi, thank you for your post.
Are you familiar with Bitcoinica liquidator’s claim against Gox (2012) and would it take priority over customer’s claims if liquidated?
@_date: 2015-01-01 03:33:06
Okay, okay… those evil guys got all the Gox coins and now making markets with them as their decadent wicked brains please (maybe even using their Bx100t financial assets and almost unlimited power and influence to boot), preventing ingenious innovation and making fun of our pet currency, playing poor us for fools as they used to do for millenniassssssss…
We’ve got it. Liquidators/bankruptcy law/etc… meh, just wipe your mouth and enjoy New Year’s fireworks. :)
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:52:24
But he will win.., so TIA.
@_date: 2015-03-18 02:10:07
Yep and for quite a while now. Only place in the UK to get Swanson’s range of cheap supplements, if that’s your thing. Unfortunately just accepting Bitcoin with no discount in UK’s market isn’t going to bring many (if any) new sales.
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:51:05
Okay, that mango desk looks fake... but still good for fuel, I guess.

Privacy and speed are moving on fine, the main problem IMO is dust. Finite resource getting depleted by poor fees calculations/insignificant amounts left at disposable wallets. Some sort of dust sweeps should be implemented by consensus or ‘destroy wallet’ optional feature to forward those tiny balances to the miners. And stop dust sent into a big wallet with a message is a must. Spam can kill. Possibility of disallowing receipt of messages unless requested or having transactions below threshold automatically purged/forwarded to charity/etc. should be worked on wallet design level at least.

Well, someone is clearly profiting from all those of new ‘investors’. Surely Tux knows who. Surely it can be stopped, but why if it brings such huge trade volume and nice revenue. Same as why give the Bitcoinica’s/Zhou’s funds to liquidators if they appreciate nicely, and just their past near-worthless dollar equivalent is really what’s ‘required’.
I say, we have our own trading ‘elite’ right here. Those ‘scoopers’ with timed walls/bots who are privy to the magical ‘666’ ddos crap, etc and they would never be disclosed or have their accounts suspended by Gox.
The only way is to educate the market… 8)
