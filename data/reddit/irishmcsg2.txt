Wait, I thought it was something like 10,000 bitcoins to eat pizza for a day.

Awesome, thanks!

Are there any bits left?

No one's going to just give you bitcoins. You need the bank account to convert your USD into BTC. If you want to deal in cash, you can try  and check your area for people willing to trade bitcoins for cash in person.

Dang, missed the sub 9600 bottom, but getting some stabilization in the 9700 range for some cheap coins!

Buy at least $200 at a time from Coinbase. Or better yet, head over to GDAX (same credentials as Coinbase), transfer your USD there, and then trade for BTC fee-free. Or for smaller chunks at a time, try localbitcoins to buy direct from sellers.

No. you just paid a 20% fee. Sure, over time you'll probably still come out ahead if you hodl, but there are better ways to take baby steps into crypto.

What's the catch here? How/why are they paying out $300/BTC more than other exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:27:50
As you can see by my completely scientific research presented [here]( we'll hit ~8k, dip down to ~5.5k, and then we're off to the moon!

Lots of people here have held for more than 2 years. We just didn't initially start with as much as we wish we would've now! The $45 I spent on 0.2BTC in 2013 was just a "this looks like kinda fun, let's see how fast I can lose some money" experiment, but I still have that 0.2, along with some more I've accrued since then.

People who don't even have $250 to their name go to prison for stealing $250. People who have $30,000,000 don't go to prison for stealing another $50,000,000.

We already covered this. 7.

The benefit is just that they’re anonymous. Insert cash, get btc. No need for identity verification like on an exchange.

That's not how it works. You can always buy more regardless of the current price. Don't try to time the market yadda yadda yadda.

That's not how it works. The bitcoins used at the ATM still exist and are worth just as much as every other bitcoin. They just changed ownership.

Hadn't heard of cashintocoins.com before, so tried to check it out. Got this:  hmm...

I've been perfectly happy with buying/selling on coinbase, and trading on campbx. No issues at all with either of them.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:58:41
still up for me...

any publicity is good publicity. The government bringing virtual currencies to more people's attentions will only increase interest.
