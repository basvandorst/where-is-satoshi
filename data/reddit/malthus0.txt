I'm still learning about trading from books and have only ever dipped my toes in the markets. Let alone crypto trading.  But even I was like 'oh shit classic head and shoulders! Abort Abort!'

I think the advice in general is don't day trade whether it is Crypto or not. Most people aren't cut out for it and you are throwing away the flexibility of more sensible longer term trades. 
Day trading is like formula 1, in that you might want to learn to drive and go cart successfully first.

Traditionally the main or central street of a town where you go to do your shopping. Depending on where you are a high street may have major national chains, local shops, and market stalls. As well as other businesses.

Money is only a tool. The pursuit of better is a virtue however. The individuals concerned may not be happier but they are mankind's engine of progress. If our ancestors decided to adopt ascetic values we would still be living in caves or grubbing subsistence from the soil. Those who chase better even for ungratifying motives or through unhealthy mental attitudes are the true altruists of our age sacrificing themselves for the greater good.

City AM is the only classical liberal/free market newspaper in the UK. (perhaps in the world).  City AM has been positive to bitcoin in the past and has treated it seriously. Kevan Dowd is a proponent of free banking otherwise known as competing currencies he shares the values of bitcoin even if he does not endorse it. Believe me Bitcoiners should want City AM to do well.

I posted a similar link to this yesterday, however I thought this deserved to be posted becasue it has more actual info (like where the place is) then the pretty bad quality video in yesterdays link did.

It's not paywalled for me; perhaps it is because you are not in the UK.

Guys, this is not unique to bitcoin. It happens ordinary stock traders as well, and it is not good. Emotions are what make a lot of people loose money. Elation on the up then depression &amp; panic on the down. Leading to the self destructive behaviour of selling on the down &amp; buying on the up. Even if you withstand the temptation it can seriously mess with your perspective. 
Have a plan stick to it. As for myself I made to decision to long term invest, buying small amounts with disposable income at semi regular intervals. This has the advantage of smoothing out fluctuations &amp; not making any particular purchase very important or risky. This strategy actually makes me WANT a sustained price drop.

Dowd is not a journalist he is a scholar.  He is also not mainstream but part of the [free banking movement]( . Little free market City AM is the only paper someone like Dowd would get a platform. If you want mainstream think the pink (literally and figuratively) Financial Times.
It is quite wrong to lump him in with the idiot naysayers even if he does turn out to be wrong.

The two situations are not comparable. Gox was an exchange, their prices did not reflect the general market price because of restrictions they put in place as they were failing &amp; their customers fleeing. 'China' is a whole market. If demand falls in China because of government restrictions and harrasment then that is a real fall in the global demand for bitcoin. If in total less people are buying then that must affect the price. Putting your head in the sand won't change that.

"Commercial lawyer and ASI Fellow Preston J. Byrne continues to explain why, despite the cries of his inner libertarian, more government involvement in Bitcoin would be a step forward for the cryptocurrency-cum-payment-system, rather than its end"

I have bought from Azteco and it really is quck easy and anonymous.  The trick is incentivising merchants to sell, the same way they sell phone cards and oyster payments.

There are tricks to get past pay-walls. Viewing the google cache is a old one that still works sometimes. I viewed the wall street journal article alluded to by just copying the title "Mt. Gox Receives Subpoena From Federal Prosecutor" into google and clicking the resultant link. I would prefer people kept posting interesting stuff from behind paywalls so as to at least give me the change to try to view it.

 Chinese investors are still trading bitcoin and buying initial coin offerings, suggesting authorities in Beijing are struggling to clamp down on cryptocurrencies just weeks after announcing that public exchanges would be shut down.
Observers feared the closure of Chinese exchanges would lead to a sharp drop in demand for bitcoin, given China has been a key source of demand. Instead, more of the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies has gravitated towards the private over-the-counter market.
Bitcoin, the best known cryptocurrency, has set a series of records in recent weeks. At the same time, the renminbi share of OTC bitcoin trading has risen from about 5 per cent at the beginning of September, before exchanges were shut, to about 20 per cent a month later, according to data cited in a report by the National Committee of Experts on Internet Financial Security, a government-backed research group. 
“The situation with China’s exchanges has pushed more of its trading over the counter, where there is a fairly robust and liquid market,” said John Riggins, head of Asia operations for BTC Media, a fintech information platform.
Chinese investors are also using mobile messaging platforms to connect, negotiating bilateral trades without the help of an exchange. Many OTC bitcoin transactions originally used WeChat, Tencent’s ubiquitous mobile messaging. However, concern about surveillance has driven many traders to Telegram, an encrypted platform that boasts greater security. 
However, the clampdown is proving more challenging for bitcoin miners, who had flocked to China’s hinterland in Gansu and Inner Mongolia, where cheap electricity can power rows of computers creating bitcoin. 
China’s OTC market is not yet liquid enough to allow bitcoin miners to facilitate the sale of hundreds of thousands of dollars of newly-minted bitcoin each day, market observers say.
 “There are a lot of questions about the future of the Chinese miners, given that they still need to pay for staff and operations in renminbi,” said Thomas Glucksman, head of marketing for Gatecoin, a bitcoin exchange and ICO underwriter in Hong Kong. “It’s either a case of migrating their operations or facilitating renminbi cash-out through the OTC market.” 
Initial coin offerings are still being marketed, though the obstacles facing Chinese investors wanting to take part are now larger. In principle, Chinese investors who already own bitcoin or ethereum, a rival cryptocurrency, can still buy into an ICO on a foreign platform. But many overseas ICO platforms have strengthened know-your-client requirements to avoid running afoul of mainland regulators, while some have deleted Chinese-language versions of their websites. 
The Chinese ban on ICOs has also generated some additional short-term demand for bitcoin as ICO sponsors moved to comply with the government’s order. 
“All ICO teams in China should return funds as bitcoin or ethereum to their investors. So demand is high,” said Sandy Liang, operating director in Hong Kong for Bitcan, a bitcoin wallet, news and price quotation app.

At the end of the day this "cryptocurrency" is just a promise by the proven to be untrustworthy Venezuelan government to pay a certain amount of oil for a token. It is just like a shit gold standard except the bank manager habitually sells all the gold in the vault for prostitutes and heroin.
