Hmm. You seem to be jumping to conclusions. I never said anywhere that I wouldn't support my family or friends, or even just people that need help. But you know, I'd probably feel more comfortable having it in my own bank account rather than my parents. There would be a lot less hassle if I needed to manage the money.
Just because someone's not an adult doesn't mean they don't understand how to manage their funds either. I'm not going to go and blow it on useless things when it could be used to pay for education, driving lessons and whatnot.
I get what you're saying, though.

I don't know much about the currency. I understand the basics of it, how blocks are mined and coins are generated, but I don't full understand the demand. I don't know if they will rise or fall in the future.
If I were to sell now, I'd still be extremely happy with the $1100/btc.

I already have my own bank account. The issue was if it would be "safe" to transfer that much BTC and store it in my bank account.
And yeah. It was more of a trade. I wanted some BTC because it looked cool, he wanted some gold in the game. Back then, it wasn't much whatsoever. I completely forgot about it, but found it in a backup on my Dropbox account yesterday after realizing how expensive they were getting.
I trust my parents not to blow it. But I still think I'd be more comfortable with the money going into my own account.
Thanks for the comments man!
