Glad to see that they're using AGPL for this.  I'm curious how this will scale.

It makes the exchange a joke in the long run.  $1000 isn't very much for even a medium sized trader.  I'm sure that Japan's stock markets do not follow this rule, so I don't understand why this would be the case for MtGox.
If this is Japanese law, then I would say that Japan is not the best place to host an exchange.

So I agree with you in principle about a decentralized exchange, but I just don't see how you can have a decentralized exchange involving fiat currency like USD.  At least you would need a centralized clearing house/escrow service for the transactions.
The plan here is not to run an exchange, but to write the software.  Presumably one or two companies would use this software, giving the community a couple of solid sites to work with.
Also, I made it a self post :)

[Here]( is a thread discussing bitcoin 7.  Apparently they lifted a bunch of their site text from Tradehill (including their location, which was incorrect), and had some rounding errors in their currency.
It's possible that those things are fixed now.

Well, if the server is published using the AGPL, it is illegal for them to not publish all their modifications.
As far as bad management -- obviously code can't fix that.  Honestly, management is what these companies should be competing on anyway, not the core software.

Sure, but it's your money, so you should be able to move it out once the trade has been confirmed as legitimate.
No bank would ever be allowed to institute such a policy.

It might be possible to form some sort of non-profit to run an exchange, but I think you would have a hard time getting non-profit status in the US for a financial venture.
I can't imagine running things without some sort of corporate entity though, too much liability.

How about an API that makes a bit more sense than the MtGox one, for example:
* Placing an order should return the order id (and other details) of the order you just placed, not a list of all your outstanding orders, this is just silly.
* An argument that limits the number of bid/ask orders returned when fetching the market status.  Most applications/bots don't need to continually refresh the entire market, but might want to know the boundary stuff frequently.
* A more detailed balance report indicating how much of each currency is 'reserved' in current orders (including fees).
* A way of viewing order history (with parameters for controlling how far back to look/how many to return etc.).
* Order lists (outstanding and historical) should show me more details, like when the order was placed, fees, how much has been filled, and how many (and even the sizes) of the various orders that have partially filled it.
* The ability to generate a bitcoin address to transfer in funds.
* The ability to send bitcoins out of the exchange (MtGox has this, TH doesn't appear to be planning this).
Instead of a $1000/day limit a la MtGox, I would rather see a timed (perhaps 1-2 hours) embargo on withdrawing money/bitcoins that were recently acquired.  Of course, if I have $10000 in my account and just make $1000, I should be able to withdraw $10000 immediately, but not $11000 until after the embargo period.
Also, I would like a very clear &amp; detailed explanation of fees.  For example, I cannot tell from looking at TradeHill's documentation whether both the buyer and seller pay transaction fees (though I could be blind), nor can I tell how the fee % changes -- is it only through additional referrals, or does volume get you a discount?

Again, glad to see people are using AGPL for these exchanges, but I am skeptical of the scaling and security of running things on a simple LAMP setup.

Interesting, I didn't know about the socket api.  I guess it's still in beta, so not listed on their api webpage.

AFAIK Facebook only uses LAMP for their front end.  The heavy lifting is custom back end services.  Not to mention the customization they've likely had to do on the stack itself.
Edit to add:  If scaling is such a non-issue then why do sites like Tradehill (and previously MtGox) behave so badly when as few as 1000 users are trying to use them?
