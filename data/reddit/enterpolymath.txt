One thing I’m almost sure about in cryptoland: Expect the unexpected.

There are so many efficient ways to use DLT, regardless of success in Africa, the future for the industry is bright and no FUD can change that. But with rather long way to mass adoption, speculation might rule for quite some time...

Well share your advice with him, hope it sticks :)

If it helps blockchain in anyway, sure :)
Elon did a great job on bringing electric cars to mainstream... He seems to be failing at scaling and competition that is great at scaling is taking on... Instead of toughening up and showing his magic, he seems to be having a breakdown in front of everyone.
So some elaborate buyback scam aside, things are not going Teslas way.
But I’m sticking to supporting blockchain - shorting on a visionary that has clear capacity to change the world is bad karma...

We are all good, as Tesla is almost inevitably going down :)

Early investor, keeping low profile with the car, yet decided to show how many zeros he added by hodling :)

Pretty sure it’s owned by Count Dracula. Giving long term hodling a new dimension ;)

Have been working on Ethereum for the last couple of years and 1.0 is just fine for serious, real world applications that are fully scalable with the help of purpose built L2s. And while you do need eth2.0 to became the backbone of web 3.0 and other noble goals, Ethereum remains a technological and social marvel with all the shortcomings it has.
But you do you.

DeFi bothers me. So does a lot of unnecessarily overpromising lingo from parts of the community (not V though). 
Pragmatic work on business cases from SME to multinationals demonstrates the utility of Ethereum network. Happening now.
No one talks about this though. And I understand your frustration as a lot of it comes as a rightful critique of BS thats shoved around. I’d argue echo chambering is a factor too, but that happens in all crypto communities. No worries about ad hominem, this is Reddit after all and for someone I would categorize as a maxi you seem really constructive.

Come to think of it - Nick is that you?

Consensys ain’t much better with pushing the 1M devs narrative... That being said Ethereum does have the upper hand on the devs, but given the broad potential use, it depends on it.

Unlike the other, this one does hodl some serious utility value :)

And there’s a sword behind that red curtain...

Actually this is rather doable and arguably in line with the white paper (some interpretations). You can have mechanisms in place in advance to make it efficient and relatively inexpensive. It’s the broader stakeholder/community reaction that makes it much less rational, yet hardly impossible... 
Several scenarios discussed on Twitter..
It’s not about not having the power to do it, but in this case it would make little sense. Adding a zero (10x) to the problem could change the calculation.

Sorry, but thank you for halting make crypto main stream :)
