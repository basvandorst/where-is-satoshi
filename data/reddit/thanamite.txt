Was that a promise?

Lots of talk about ICOs buying/selling and SEC making it easier to buy. Investments for the sake of investments.
Where are the discussions about the inherent value of cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2018-10-12 12:17:47
Lol. Good one.
@_date: 2019-02-27 03:16:21
The tech says it is pretty easy to create new and cheap crypto currencies. Does that mean that paying a lot for a particular cryptocurrency is a waste of money?
@_date: 2019-02-25 01:42:20
Yes! Until it does not!
@_date: 2019-12-17 12:54:29
Make money, we should!
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:39:08
No one cares. People just want to make quick money.
@_date: 2019-12-17 12:56:35
It is interesting how many rationalizations people give where they really want to make money.
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:37:53
At least pharmacy advertisements have warnings.
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:53:52
Another cryptic response. 
I don’t see why I need a cryptocurrency to be my own bank. I can use my pockets just fine.
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:42:59
So that others can sell and buys lambos with your money.
@_date: 2019-04-09 00:59:31
Why so few transactions?
Isn’t the idea that people would buy things with cryptocurrencies maybe even many times a day?
Isn’t reducing those transaction costs important?
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:39:20
So what do you use it for cat?
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:21:50
It is a great day when someone who peddles one-sided truth gets captured. It has nothing to do with what currency he uses.
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:23:21
These points make a lot of sense to me. I see too few discussions on how to make Bitcoin useful. I would think that if it is not useful who cares how secure it is?
These may be stupid questions but sometimes I think the Bitcoin environment has become too complicated for common people.
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:41:33
Interesting, Thanks. I learned something today.
Who guarantees the non-chain transactions.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:33:54
Relax. He said at minimum.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:40:38
Based on something
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:07:21
Funniest post of the day! Take my upvote.
I am just curious why you didn’t add a few more 0s there. I mean, if you are going to support bitcoin you might as well go all the way.
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:17:32
I heard July/15, definitely before noon.
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:12:49
You have to admit it was hilarious.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:24:33
Yup. They are all fake alright.
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:14:20
Since we are pulling numbers out of thin air, how about 2,025,000? :-)
@_date: 2018-07-11 15:37:27
In practice, they are really cryptoinvestments.
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:17:58
Yup. Sure thing. Time to start buying everyone!
@_date: 2018-07-11 15:25:40
If you know the future then you should do that.
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:39:50
School kids use paper and make mistakes all the time. Einstein also used paper. Oh crap! We are screwed.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:40:55
If bitcoin survives and stabilizes and it manages to remain decentralized and independent, what prevents people from replacing it with something else?
It is inevitable that a generic crypto API will come out removing all speculative value out of them and letting only their utility based value.
Edit: assuming a universe of infinite crypto currencies and a generic access API what makes one more valuable than another? I would say  stability. And what if a team pegs a crypto to the dollar, removes crypto inflation and defines mining profits to come only out of transaction costs? There are so many options that thinking a particular crypto currency is going to win sounds like wishful thinking to me.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:56:22
Problem is, these predictions are based on just hope.
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:54:14
When the prices dropped to nothing the dog bought all crypto currencies.
@_date: 2018-12-17 04:20:33
Wow! A recursive definition. So it it more valuable because it is more valuable.
Finally, the next step in the evolution of understanding Bitcoin is here!
@_date: 2018-12-30 04:01:37
I doubt bitcoin good purchases are anywhere close to 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% of MasterCard’s volume.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:35:36
Admitting there is nothing to Bitcoin except of faith is admirable.
In other cases such feedback loops helped build up physical stores or databases of reviews or customers with registered credit cards or ecosystems that solidified solutions.
But what does Bitcoin get out of this? Both the API and the miners can switch to other crypto-coins 10 times a second. Where is the anchor?
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:54:49
I am the Gandalf 
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:59:30
So true
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:17:01
That was sarcasm. Jeez ;-)
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:40:32
No number of years will make up for a lack of intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:32:26
Well put sir!
