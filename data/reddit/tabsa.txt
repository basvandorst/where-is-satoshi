"Arrrr, the kraken is released bitches. Even if/when bitcoin comes under heavy fire there is no stopping the idea now. Just as bittorent raped the entertainment goons and their copyright weaksauce, so shall cryptocurrency DSK the sovereign fiat maid."
Can you draw this?

All the information and even source code is already available online to everyone.
This is an opportunity for a current project leader to present the new technology from a certain perspective and outline a vision. The obvious thing is that the technology is out, and it's possible it will change the way world works, citizens of USA should atleast be happy that they have bright people working in their government agencies - people who recognize important new technologies (speaking as an eastern european here).
As for GOOD uses: Funding current democracy movements in the middle east would be more easy and viable?

Taxability is not an actual property of any currency, be it Bitcoin, USD or EUR. By your logic using carrots for barter should be illegal because they don't have tax gene in them.
The responsibility to account and pay taxes is upon the entity doing the transactions not on the currency used in those transactions. As a business entity or as an employee you will still have to pay taxes even if you accept goods in Bitcoin, or get a salary in Bitcoin. If you want to avoid paying taxes, there are ways to do that in all currencies.
And about the GOOD thing i pointed out - it does not matter that it's far fetched to you, it's still a new way to use this technology. What CIA will decide to do is up to them. You don't even need the CIA anymore to fund uprisings now, just donate Bitcoin to your favorite uprising leaders.

Bitcoin is just like cash, just virtual and with predictable rules of creation instead of quite unpredictable fiat money rules.
So whatever rules work if you want to lend cash to your friend, also work just the same in Bitcoin. Risk/Trust/Contract etc.
BTC network just ensures that currency cannot be counterfeited or created out of thin air (known and predictable rules). Whatever lending organization or mechanism you want to setup is up to you.
Banks charge exuberant rates for high risk, because thats the price for the risk they take, they still want to make money, just like everyone else. It's a completely different problem space and it doesn't matter whether you are lending waffles carrots or Bitcoins.

It seems that i lost all everything due to a somekind of the bug, can you check the log? The last bet seems to have wiped balance from 0.089, to less than 0.006
can you check by my referall code?

Also, CIA does not give a fuck about collecting taxes. US government is not one person, but multiple agencies/groups of people with quite different sometimes even opposite values and goals and problems.

How many confirmations are needed to add bitcoin to my balance?
@_date: 2011-04-28 18:20:17
Maybe IPv6 is still not used by everyone because no one cares. But you do care if your money is involved, so upgrading bitcoin network could possibly be more easy.

It would be interesting to have a Bitcoin client with integrated mechanisms of trust similar to the ones used in [Bitcoin OTC](
It could probably make the Bitcoin viable for local markets and realtime transactions. For example: customers with 0 trust would have to pay cash or wait ~15 minutes for transactions to confirm, and if you have &gt;5 trust unconfirmed transactions would be accepted too.

"yopencl.LogicError: clGetPlatformIDs"
you are probably missing files in 
amdocl32.icd  amdocl64.icd  (or rename to libamdocl32.so  libamdocl64.so for 2.4 SDK) These come from icd-registration.tgz.
Also after that you may be missing these:
export AMDAPPSDKROOT=/opt/AMD-APP-SDK-v2.4-lnx32/
export AMDAPPSDKSAMPLESROOT=/opt/AMD-APP-SDK-v2.4-lnx32/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/AMD-APP-SDK-v2.4-lnx32/lib/x86/:/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib

On the topic of exchanges: 
If you would look back two years ago at exchanges you would find a quite more problems, than you do right now.
Back then there was no two factor authentication at MtGox, which also had more than 90% of the exchange market. I also remember couple of exchanges shutting down because of inexperience of their operators, and Tradehill suspending their operations.
Right now Tradehill is back online, couple of more competitors to mtgox have also taken a good share of the exchange market. Also putting things in perspective is inability of NASDAQ to handle the facebook IPO without lag, compared to that,  MtGox are guys working out their garage (and still doing a fine job!).
The responsibility of keeping the bitcoin healthy also falls on regular users. Having healthy pool and exchange ecosystems will help bitcoin to reach the potential it has. So educate yourself - participate in or build things that help bitcoin grow.
So to answer the question, there are some faults that are being fixed and hopefully won't repeat.
TL;DR Exchanges have some faults that are being fixed and hopefully won't repeat.
