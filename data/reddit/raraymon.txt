yes however there still needs to be a cycle of coins...People exchange for cash people that need to purchase cloud space buy it from someone selling...and pay more people for storage...
@_date: 2014-08-19 03:47:00
Then why is the cloud industry a 150 billion dollar industry?

I respect your opinion and I have seen this exact same discussion play out many times with you and You and I both know its not worth us arguing back and forth on it so lets agree to disagree.
@_date: 2014-08-19 04:15:42
if you read what storj has put out  you would see it was never anticipated to reach the goal of 9800
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:54:01
Thank for the catch.  I am pushing the fix to github right now.
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:50:11
has said before that if someone wanted to fork storj and make it work better or differently and it had greater adoption there is nothing to stop that
edit: As with bitcoin and every other coin that forked it out there they are simply forks of the first mover attempting to do it "better"

I am not sure where you got that impression.  All SJCX was created as a counterparty asset. 500,000,000 were created and locked.  
15% of the coins are reserved for community use, i.e. bounties, payements for maintaining social media, forums, help desk etc.  
15% of the coins are for the developers as part of salaries etc.
70% of the coins are reserved for crowdsales and for rewards to early farmers.  may give you some clarity on how the network will function.  There never has been a plan to launch a block chain of our own.  When factom is up and going we plan on utilizing their project as a way to store the merkle roots of files stored on the network on the blockchain.  In short factom will store a merkle root as a single hash on the bitcoin blockchain that will be the root for many transactions to avoid blockchain bloat.  This is a very short summary of the process. you can read more here

no reason they can't in fact this could be a great company that "recycles" coins back to people who need to buy storage

This is a small misunderstanding.  Coins will not be issued for providing storage.  Coins will be paid to people running nodes by the people uploading data to the nodes.  Storj Holding coins has no bearing on how users are rewarded
@_date: 2014-12-25 06:43:43
There is already more than 500 but that is nice and generous of you to do

Storj will always use sjcx, there will never be a time that sjcx is not the fuel for the network.  Sjcx is the "appcoin" to purchase and sell space on the storj network.  we plan on using factom when that point comes to store metadata on the blockchain.  In the meantime for development we plan on using florincoin.

It has a lot to do with the amount of data that can be stored in a block
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:46:50
That argument does not hold very much weight as people are currently holding it...If that argument were 100% true there would be nobody holding SJCX at the moment
@_date: 2014-12-27 03:07:18
I disagree however you are entitled to your own opinion.  If someone wanted to do this with bitcoin they would be.  Bitcloud has been taking your stance for quite some time may be a good person for you to reach out to
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:15:36
No specific coin but I think there are great "2.0" projects out there that seem to get beaten down on here at times factor, storj, gems etc
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:07:55
In USD terms the projects funding pot has fallen greatly

I don't think you understand how sharing links on reddit typically works
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:06:53
I think that if some others opened up saying they had interest in a large otcpurchase it may help the conversation
@_date: 2015-01-09 11:39:34
There has been nothing secret about this discussion/vote storjtalk.org is the primary place of discussion for storj.  There has always been part of the plan to hold future sales of any form.  
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:08:15
Actually if you contributed on day one of the sale the prce has fallen almost 55%

I think this post hits a major point home.  
With bitcoin we are attempting to find a small amount every so often and devoting massive amounts of computer power to do it.  This is not easy for the layman to pick up and just start doing.  Let alone actually go out and buy some today.
Storj however should be fairly easy for people to set up.  Set a folder on their drive and start farming.  Receive payment for storing peoples files.  Selling the coins back on the market will be good for the value of storj.  This is how people will need to acquire the coins or someone creating a fiat exchange. 
This cycle with a fixed amount of coins that are randomly distributed will be beneficial to all
The guy with 100 PB of storage and standard connection has just as much chance of hosting the file as the guy down the road with 100 GB to store the same file.  This is equal and will not be able to be dominated by large farms.
This is a new structure, this is a whole new world in the world of crypto.  Don't be afraid of it embrace it and support innovation.

You had to burn btc for XCP,  you then burn a little XCP to issue a new token

There will be some possibilities of making some money however the most profitable will be that with already owned assets.  As you will not get paid by simply offering space but by having that space utilized
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:48:07
All individuals who have put money into the project are nameless so nobody should be singled out.  
As I stated storj talk is and will be the primary place for discussions related to storj. What method do you propose we use on counterpart to hold voting?
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:17:01
Your vote total makes my point exact,  advancing beyond Bitcoin the currency and working on things butcoin the technology can provide seem to be not popular topics
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:53:28
Many of these wuestions are answered in the white paper storj.io/storj.pdf

You need to at this point in time have been a crowd sale participant
@_date: 2014-08-19 04:08:09
lookin in OP's history nothing has ever been posted about storj...and storj posted  the other day stating why the goal of 9800 was chosen and how it was never anticipated to reach that goal.

You could pay s3 to run drive share on however your costs could potentially be higher by paying then than running in your own personal computer
