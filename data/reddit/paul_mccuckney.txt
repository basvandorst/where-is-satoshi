I would say they are likely not opposing powers, but one power playing both sides. You fund both sides, then you win no matter the outcome. The thing with crypto is if one iteration is compromised, informed users can move to the next as it splits like a hydra, and the powers that be have a game of whack-a-mole.

Ok, then you will not need to make a new backup of your wallet.dat. However that wallet is now online. Generally when people say offline they mean a wallet whose private keys are air-gaped from the internet and have never been on an online device. If you have already sent from the same wallet.dat that holds 10BTC by importing it then I would consider moving them to cold storage. Obviously it depends on your personal risk threshold. In the future when you want to send from cold storage, sweep the private keys into online wallets and send from there, then your cold wallet stays cold.

Because of its nature people will hold BTC up to their personal risk threshold. They won't indefinitely trade fiat for bitcoin until they are out of fiat, even if the fiat is inflationary vs BTC. They may have a risk threshold of 10% of their net worth in BTC, but as it appreciates to 15% of their net worth they have to re-balance, selling and holding.

If it is encrypted with strong password then not particularly worried. His best chance of getting your bitcoin would be to get you to give him the password by force or deception.

What method are you using to spend from your offline wallet?
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:43:35
"Good enough" depends on your requirements. How much BTC are you going to keep in it? How secure do you consider your online device to be? 
For small amounts electrum on your online device is likely fine. For large amounts it is recommended to use a cold wallet/offline wallet (ie a paper wallet - private keys printed on paper) or hardware wallet (pricier but likely worth the investment for ease of use) or a software wallet on a device that never goes online.

Bitcoin vs BitcoinCHina. Internationl communities are not going to trust china coin, there is no longterm viability as a global money, maybe a local one, if they get some devs that can do more than copy/paste

Fees are the result of an equation where on one side you have transaction throughput and on the other side, decentralization. When user number goes up, fees go up. If blocks are made larger to handle more fees, burden of cost increases on nodes and decentralization falls. No crypto has solved this problem yet.  
The cryptos that claim to have solved the problem have have either swapped out throughput (no one uses them) or have swapped out decentralization (blockchains growing unsustainably, masternode/ top down topology).


Other cryptos will remain having lower fees in the short term, because they will sacrifice decentralization or just have less users, but every blockchain based crypto will have the same growing pains as bitcoin if they reach its throughput and comparable level of decentralization. I do not see a competitor until a more fundamental solution is found, but I believe currently bitcoin devs are closest with a 2nd layer solution.


The valuable part of a cryptocurrency is its immutable ledger, that is literally the only reason to use a blockchain (an otherwise inefficient solution). Once you have that layer of immutability you can build on top of it. You can build a low fee cash system (centralized) layer on top of a stable, trustless storage of value layer but you can't build it the other way around, and bitcoin is the gold standard of immutable ledgers. Sending every node on the network every transaction is not a functional way to get to high transaction levels, the alts that try it are driving off a cliff.

I don't mind the idea of having a more cash like crypto for smaller payments but BCH isn't going to cut it. Its centralized nature and asicboost compatibility essentially cripples it long term. No one is going to make asics for a coin where the sole miner has a patent on a productivity advantage. So it becomes a monopoly. BCH is basically "bitcoin china", which by all intents and purposes becomes chinese government coin. What percentage of the world is going to want to put serious resources/investment into that?

You were literally talking about transaction load


so you clearly believe that it is relevant to value, otherwise why mention it?

Coinbase? I think they delay payments to avoid fraud. Because bitcoin is irreversible some exchanges are extra careful to make sure your payment clears before letting you withdraw BTC.

Cryptocurrencies do not exist in a vacuum. What makes bitcoin work is how it aligns incentives to get people to protect it. In that sense the users act like a nervous system, alerting the ecosystem to what is happening and routing around it be that with information, capital or code.

It's not just theory. If bitcoin's value was based on transaction speed for use as p2p cash, Litecoin would have a higher market cap than bitcoin. It's value is clearly derived from something else.

Miner Man finds exploit in bitcoin to make more money.  
Maintainers of bitcoin notice.  
Rules are changed, exploit doesn't work anymore.  
Miner Man angry.  
Miner Man wants people to use coin where his exploit works.  
Makes money from BitcoinCash as exploit still possible.  
Needs to get people to actually buy/use BitcoinCash.  
Cause problems for bitcoin.  
Use these problems as 'proof' BitcoinCash is better.

Because of chinese asicboost patents and the resulting centralization of mining it produces, BCH is essentially "bitcoin china". Is the world going to invest in a coin controlled by chinese monetary policy? Secured by chinese law? BCH has no long term global economic future regardless of what it is called.

Which is exactly my point. There is no law saying you can't price your BTC in eggs, but it would be impractical to use as unit of value so no one does.
 
Gold is priced in USD for the same reason BTC is. Doesn't mean the people buying gold want USD.

It's interesting because you are about 80% of the way to being a stronger advocate of bitcoin than the average man on the street would be, without even realizing it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:44:11
Because a dollar is an arbitrary unit of value that people are more familiar with. You could value your BTC in eggs, but it would be less practical. People want more wealth, doesn't matter what it is denominated in. I don't live in the US, doesn't mean I don't want $1m worth of BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:42:47
My advice would be not to try to "time the market". Set aside some amount that you want to invest and then invest that amount into BTC over time, depending on how time sensitive you are this could be weeks, months or years. As well as lowering variance, this gives you time to do research, set up wallets etc.

That's the narrative of the media, because all time highs and 'crashes' get more clicks than any of the technological/societal aspects of crypto.


The idea that everyone in the space thinks it will replace fiat is also a common strawman used. I would say the majority do not expect anything like this and indeed it does not need to occur in order for the network to have utility. It can still be an effective hedge against traditional asset classes without replacing anything.

Most convenient for smaller amounts is probably localbitcoins. For larger amounts probably Coinfloor but you need to get verified with ID.

The ideological split pre-fork caused uncertainty in pre-fork bitcoin, adding downward pressure on the price. Once the split occurred this pressure was gone and the combined value of the coin(s) could rise. The value didn't come from no where, it was incumbent on a clean ideological and technical split.


There are exchanges where you can sell $100k worth of BTC instantly and withdraw to bank in 24 hrs

It doesn't have to scale on current tech, it has to scale on future tech. Things evolve. The bitcoin ecosystem will look very different in 10 years.

This wasn't really anything to do with a paper wallet, other than a misunderstanding of its purpose. The whole point of a paper wallet is that the private key never touches the internet until spending. The story isn't clear but it seems like OP imported (?) his private key into a blockchain.info wallet and then left it there for some time (?), thereby negating the security a paper wallet gives you. I would agree that hardware wallets are superior though.

Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's a cryptocurrency, which is a new asset class. It acts as a commodity when held and a commodity money when traded. It's volatility does not effect its utility.
