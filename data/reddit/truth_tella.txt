Why would I delete my comment lmfao. It's as irrelevant as your comment. Who cares :p

It has the grammar of the CEO. Although it seems a little too good of writing. Anyways, GAW has made their bed and now they must lay in it. They scammed tens of thousands of people based on lies and fraud.

Rest in pepperonis BitcoinTalk. I bet it's Josh Garza's fault. *trollface*

I'll add to that picture evidence of what most would call outright fraud
most important --&gt;

Typical. More excuses. Hey Mr. Homero Garza, please explain your blatant fraud caught with picture evidence.
Most important --&gt; 
Still super important --&gt;

Reenact his scenario then tell me that's the default fee?
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:38:32
Go pay somebody "who can be bothered to mess with fees" at a bank $50 to send the money in 5 days because you obviously are having troubles. My honest suggestion since you don't want to take the necessary 10 seconds to change a digit to clear a transaction quickly for pennies. Entitled prick.

Wow you must be an expert. Completely, 100% way more intelligent than me and so by default I trust your insight. Won't sell even a penny's worth, so declares the almighty junseth.

I'm an apprentice jeweler and would be interested in selling 10k, 14k, 18k, 22k solid gold chains and fine .999 silver or sterling silver chains for 20% discount BY WEIGHT of the chain compared to typical retail. Anyway to get updates via reddit?

So you're mad you don't know how to use it properly and are blaming the entire network? Damn that's solid logic, can't argue there.
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:04:23
I think your $0.0000000001 fee was a little too low. Try $0.00001 next time. Or give your bank $25-100 and wait 5 days. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:14:21
Exactly my point.
