to prevent a 75% loss.  This is a speculative investment like it or not.  There is no guarantee the price will go back up.

What's the matter?  Afraid I might talk someone into selling and hurting your "profits"?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:06:02
the technology and the asset are different things though...

I'm not investing for a number of reasons. But I've seen a lot of people invest due to the hype and fomo on big gains with little to no understanding of what they're getting into. With bitcoin it's a gamble not an investment at this point. If you can't afford to lose it all you stay away. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:58:33
You joke but the internet hype is the only thing keeping this up atm. One comment leaning towards regulation from trump and this all goes up in flames.

or since he's clearly not comfortable losing everything he should probably get out now.  People shouldn't gamble with money they can't afford to lose

Blockchain doesn't just apply to crypto.  It can be leveraged by many industries. That's where the money will be... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:51:09
Are being worked on. Health care, banks, etc. All major industries are looking at the tech to streamline their business. They need 3rd parties to help them though. I forget the company that is researching the use for banks though. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:06:08
The tech is solid but it is complex. It will be a few years before they can implement it. Healthcare and banks will be pushing for it heavily though. It'll be a lot less risky than crypto

I don't know if it will be from here on out or not (I could see the bubble growing to 40k before people cash in) and I disagree that it was setup as a gimmick.  I think people genuinely wanted / want it to succeed.  However, I agree with you it will fall. There are too many challenges to overcome for it to become mainstream.  
* undermines natl. currencies - this is a main selling point of bitcoin as a currency.  However, a group of governments getting together can make it very hard for this to continue as it bypasses their regulations and sanctions.
* It's a bubble - people will argue this one tooth and nail but the current climate screams bubble.  Your gma and gpa asking for bitcoin are never going to spend it on pizza or your christmas presents.  They saw it on the news and want to ride the hype train.  Once they see a reasonable gain or some bad news story (more stories like coinbase issues) they'll run.  Part of why the avg investor will run brings me to my next point.
* It is too complex - Look at all the FAQ's and how to's required, the fee's for txns, and the time for money to move.  It took years just to roll out chip cards in the US.  We couldn't even roll out chip and pin at once.  The avg. person needs it to be stupid simple if they are going to use it as a means of payment.  And the avg. investor probably doesn't fully understand what they are doing when it comes to bitcoin.  Until complexity is resolved it will only be used as a store of value for people to try and make a quick buck (leading to the bubble above).

The info on this sub is all hype. Do yourself a favor and save that next 200. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:43:37
This is why bitcoin is all hype atm.  It is FAR too complex to get used widely as currency.  Also, the higher it goes the more no one wants to spend it because they may be able to make money off of it.  Credit card merchant providers invest so much money to make those networks work.  It would be 5 to 10 years before bitcoin could be anywhere near as widely accepted.  (in the US we couldn't even roll out chip and pin all at once).  Hope you hodlers can hodl on for that much longer.

I haven't seen it either but I think regulation will be coming.  I work at a bank and see first hand how AML / KYC regulation impacts FI's.  The current state of cryptocurrency makes money laundering and bypassing government sanctions easier.  It also undermines the USD and other currencies so governments will look to shut it down sooner or later.  If I were you I'd be looking for companies specializing in blockchain to invest in rather than the currency.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:52:54
By buying bitcoin you're not investing in the tech. You're investing in bitcoin. Investing in block chain is investing in the tech and the smarter investment. Find companies that are specialized in block chain tech.

I agree we're in the early stages and they will get resolved.  However, the current value isn't sustainable.  It isn't going to just keep growing and growing until those issues are resolved and then grow further.  The market doesn't work like that, people don't work like that.  As it grows, governments will look to regulate / ban it.  That will scare late comers from the party and I would bet be enough to burst the bubble.  Long term I do see a non-governmental currency being feasible.  But this isn't currency at this point and is far from it.  Maybe it will be the digital gold and one of the others will be the "cash".  Who knows.  But anyone who says this isn't a bubble is in denial or just stupid.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:39:52
Isn't that the end goal for crypto to be the next global currency?  if you're just in it for the gamble then that point is not as relevant then.  But big gov still is and the reason is AML and Tax Evasion.  They'll want to know who is making money without paying them their slice of the pie.  
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:53:52
bull or bear the odds of it tanking currently outweigh it hitting 100K even.  The bears also have an advantage here in that they lose absolutely nothing either way.  For the bulls they have a chance to lose all they've invested which for some people is everything they have...
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:39:32
Other countries have similar issues. And at the end of the day governments will not let their currency be undermined. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:45:13
Nah I work in banking I know what they're capable of. Can make it much more difficult to spend / convert to fiat. It's already hard enough the average person won't bother. Any tougher and btc is doomed. You don't have to buy what I'm saying. But a majority of investors have no clue what they're investing in and the true risk involved. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:29:06
There is no way in hell people are living solely on bitcoin right now. Maybe they're using their gains but they would have to convert it to another currency to pay rent / mortgage, groceries, etc. Otherwise good luck to them come tax time. Literally every purchase made with bitcoin is a taxable event... 
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:23:48
Two minutes to do something that typically takes 2 seconds... good luck boosting adoption when transactions take 10x as long.

Bmo is their parent company so don't be surprised if Harris follows suit. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:43:58
Sure maybe you're paid in bitcoin, but you currently cannot live off of bitcoin. Banks and the government are going to know when that gets transferred into dollars... 
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:32:35
Bmo and bmo Harris are different 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:33:24
You're under estimating the power governments have to shut it down if they don't like it. It undermines their currencies and helps bypass sanctions and aml. They will enact tougher restrictions. Just wait. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:59:00
But if you spend bitcoin you have to pay on the gains for every transaction. It's not feasible. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:12:16
you're high if you think crypto is ready for mainstream or that your funds are untouchable... Governments can trace crypto back to you and come knocking and even seize it if they want.  
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:48:23
Quit spreading this BS.  Banks have done so much over the last 40 years.  Could they have done more, sure.  But they're not a tech company and so they're slower to push new tech.  However, banks have been investing insane amounts of money to innovate and make money movement seamless and not due to Bitcoin.  They are interested in blockchain tech though and it may end up being used but it won't be BTC being transfered.

Don't forget the key selling point of blockchain.  It's a ledger!  Big Gov. will have easier access to track down the transactions since it's all there and can't be fudged.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:45:35
Agreed completely. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:23:07
We can't even get rid of checks. Chip and pin adoption is abysmal. Tap to pay has barely taken off. Bitcoin adoption as a currency will only happen when it's more simple than those methods and its miles away atm. Now in terms of government ability to track and seize bitcoin ask how it went for the silk rd founder who I assume had a more sophisticated set up than you do...
