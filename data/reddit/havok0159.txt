I have one store that even accepts bitcoin around me, it would be quite painful having to deal with conversion every time I want to spend money on anything that isn't PC parts.

Did you even read the statement? Low fees mean the  transaction takes forever leading to Steam getting overpaid or underpaid due to price fluctuations. They would refund the difference or they would ask for the difference whenever that happens.

Every time I've seen someone new ask about investing, the "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" advice comes up. Of course it won't be a standalone post, nobody would upvote one of those daily.

Based on history. These corrections happen and every time doomsayers appear out of the woodworks spreading FUD, newcomers believe it and they sell, things calm down and the price rises again. May not happen next week but it will happen.

Exactly, during that period you kept having people jumping off Chinese exchanges for an extended period of time but once the deadline passed, the price jumped back up. A couple of days so all those weak knees that sell at the first sign of trouble get out and we should be back on schedule.

The only reason I even use Kraken is being able to withdraw fiat for normal fees. It's a pain in the ass because it takes forever to exchange and then withdraw due to it being unstable but at least they aren't extorting me with withdrawal fees.

People unfamiliar with BTC only look at the 24 hour charts, all they ever see during these corrections is the value dropping when it's in fact still higher than it was a week ago.

So, are we expecting another drop once it hits 4k or are we past that?

How about this one, the government can't tell me what I can and can't do with my body. That isn't their job.

China didn't ban Bitcoin though, just exchanges.

I wish I had sold instead of converted from ETH, I did this when it was at it's peak too. I was planning on cashing out so I could buy another GPU but with the way things are going, that won't be happening anytime soon.

Maybe he meant that you are asking in a place that will only tell you "yes, you should".

I know how you can double your bitcoin. Be China, sell all BTC, say you are banning something related to bitcoin, buy BTC. Repeat until your bitcoin is doubled.

I make more by just mining and converting to BTC. Not only do I make more than the power costs, I also will likely not need to heat up my apartment this winter which adds up to at least one or two hundred dollars depending on how harsh the winter is. Frankly even if it all came crashing down tomorrow, if I could get back most of the power bill, I'd still be mining.

Not really your graphics cards are they though?

No, as in only BTC is splitting. Most likely however as far as prices go.

The fork will really hurt the price though, hopefully just in the short term.

Nice, I bought myself a GPU yesterday using the bitcoin I got from mining at the one store in my country that accepts bitcoin. First time spending BTC on anything as well.
