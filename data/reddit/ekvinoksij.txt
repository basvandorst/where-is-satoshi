So? A steady, controlled inflation rate is good for the economy and is seen in all widely used currencies. The fact that bitcoin is deflationary by nature might actually hinder its usefulness as a currency used for transactions.

It's not. It's a digital object, so it's not infinitely divisible by definition.

Well it only bothered me because not being continuous (ie infinitely divisible) is what distinguishes  digital information from analog information.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:59:09
How so? Digital objects are quantized and are thus not infinitely divisible.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:16:00
That doesn't make it *infinitely* divisible.

For every epsilon greater than zero, there exists a delta such that...
