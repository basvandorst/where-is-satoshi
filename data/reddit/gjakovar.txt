I don't know if this will reach your interest, but there is a great group of people helping poor people in Kosovo. Yeah you heard that right, Kosovo in South East Europe :)
So the project is called [Jam for the Cow]( (Jam per lopen in Albanian), different artists (bands/singers) play for free for a concert, usually once a year, some painters give their paintings as donation on auction and similar giveaways and all the money raised is basically buying a cow or two for different poor families living in rural areas in Kosovo. Latest concert raised for 2 cows and fixing a roof for a house.
Here's a short video: 
I also own a hostel in Prishtina so if you ever want to visit Kosovo you can come and sleep for free (maybe when the Jam for Cow is going on). We accept Bitcoins too! :)
Keep up up up the good work dude!

Well now I have to take part myself.
I own a hostel in Prishtina, Kosovo and nobody in Kosovo actually is using BTC (there are people that know about it and maybe someone owns some). Is there anyone that can help me start using it. It would be great marketing for my hostel but also good benefit for people that use BTC.
I would need a very thorough guide on how to open the wallet for my business, how to make it more secure, what devices do I need to make transactions, how can I sell my BTC to EUR or USD so I can pay my bills, etc.
I would be very thankful if you could help me with it.

I think I'll just keep them in BTC :D It would be like a savings account!
So the thing is, how can I update the prices as the BTC changes price? Like if today 1 BTC is $500 I should make the price of one bed at 0.024 BTC = $12? But then tomorrow the price could be different.
Is there any way something can update this automatically? I've checked at blockchain.info and I guess there's not some kind of POS or something. So maybe the worker at the reception should calculate every time someone want's to pay the bed with bitcoin and then just show them the wallet?
If there is a POS thing for blockchain.info I could update our website and maybe add a payment method with bitcoin directly at our booking app?
So many questions!!

It's not that I wouldn't like to have a promotional code for a plane ticket too! :)

Introduced, yeah! 
I live in Kosovo, can't buy any (at least with Coinbase) so I'm just stuck with any tip I get :(

Nobody mentioned [VLC]( You can donate to VLC team, they don't accept ads and I think they're working on donations mostly...

Nice, yeah we have a laptop on the reception but also an android phone, so that might work perfectly!

Hey, thanks for this recommendation.
I would probably use a plugin to manage Bitcoin payments but our booking system is in a different platform. If you can somehow convince them to somehow integrate Bitcoin payments into their booking system that would be awesome: 
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:00:22
Yeah, I was more thinking of a solution so I won't be too attached with it, meaning staff would know how to check if the payment is OK and other stuff.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:24:08
Wow! This is great! I'll contact you when I'm finished :)
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:53:41
Yeah, I was thinking of printing a QR code for the wallet and sticking it in the reception. Didn't know there is a watch-only wallet, so this is even better :)

You can book from our website and write a note. We will give you a great discount :)
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:21:06
Cool! 
I just opened a ticket to myallocator so maybe they will take it more seriously :)

Here we go!
Our Reception with the new info: 
Anyone wanna book (or donate :P)?: 19i5sRwtoYp5EKujVbm1LuShaFBEoWAxMd

I will have to add the bitcoin wallet and everything but the website is:  and yes as soon as I train the staff members how to actually verify that there is a transaction I will add it to coinmap.org and any place that can make some promotion to our small hostel :)
Thanks
