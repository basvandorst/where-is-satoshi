100% increase sounds scary. 26 to 50 not so much. And if you want to talk about murder and manslaughter - let's compare Sweden to USA, as I actually did in my post before.

Downward spiral of Sweden is something I've heard pretty much most of my life but it doesn't seem to be happening. And then you have also other Scandinavian countries plus Western Europe that are providing sucessfully social benefits to the general population. My guess is that such a counter example to what some people believe is dangerous and that's why it gets fables told about it.

Math is the tool. The problem is distilling experience and knowledge into math. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:28:17
If you are cherry picking one statistic as a definitive proof of a downward spiral of a whole system then you are not making a good argument at all. Let's take homicide rate in Sweden vs USA -  
Tell me if the Sweden is experiencing systemic downward spiral what is there to be said about USA? 
And let's look at Swedish crime statistics - 
I do not see anything particulary disturbing there at a glance. So could you entertain me and provide official statistics to back up your claim?

No, it is not a lot because such an increase can be just as well due to random fluctuation. If you want to do a paper on causal link between social policies and crime go ahead and go publish something because that would require academic level of work to prove and not just a statement from you. 
Sweden never adopted socialism. It has left leaning social policies but the undelrying economic system is capitalist. And as I have now stated repeatedly - I have heard this broken record about Sweden going to hell due to their policies for over 20 years now. It is not grounded in reality and is used as a tool by those who are afraid of those policies.
Sure you can cherry pick cities with better stats - but then you are doing exactly that - cherry picking. This is not how you do stats. On average USA has much mor ecrime and homicides in particular than Sweden. 
And if you want to deny the opportunity for comparison between that's not to your liking because countries are different then it means that very little can be actually compared and reasoned about. Plus you are wrong about Sweden and USA having different type of economy. There are differences of course but the general system is similar. 
And finally leftist policies are a backbone of Sweden because guess what - that's what their people want to do, for example Swedish Social Democratic Party was at the helm of government betwen 1930's to 1970's. So leftist social policies in Sweden are not something that has happened recently but a defining thing of Swedish policy.

I have asked for official statistics not stats based on user reported data. So again - can you provide me with official statistics to support your argument. As I've said I have heard the downwards spiral argument for over 20 years now about Sweden specifically and it does not stand to scrutiny. It is just a talking point by those who feel threatened by their policies.
And you don't seem to be eager to take up comparisons vs USA as I can see - so this is just all an excercise in how to paint Sweden in bad light. Thanks for the input.

Not gonna happen. ~~, should added another couple years~~

Do you have any empirical confirmation of the idea that it's a problem finding long future counterparty?
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:21:35
Do you honestly think there is not a single person in the world that can be +EV in making short term decisions on the markets? Ok.
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:00:16
It does if you are the select few that has the ability to read the market correctly, manage your funds correctly and have sufficient funds to sustain the mistakes. In other words - if you are wondering then no it doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:38:49
Market prices are best modeled statistically as a random walk with a trend - that is true. But they are not a random process actually, they would be if the markets would be perfectly efficient - which is a very strong and questionable assumption.
@_date: 2018-06-17 16:37:43
By what definition? MC=P only for a perfect competition which is pretty much an abstract idea.
@_date: 2018-06-06 01:40:58
Because if you check transaction price in USD you will simply check the exchange rate in a weird way. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:19:58
you also need price expressed in satoshis and not USD otherwise you conflate the exchange rate with actual fee.

That's only the case if inflation is higher than expected. Expected inflation is counted in the interest rate charged and does not devalue the debt.
@_date: 2019-04-23 08:18:27
That's an interesting topic on human psychology - would the adoption rate bump up if we switched the pricing form full BTC to satoshis? I would suspect so - the question is to what degree and is it a thing worth trying to make it happen.
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:56:07
I have not run into any serious analysis that puts inflation in way off territory and you do not seem to have anything to back you up on this.
@_date: 2019-04-23 09:47:37
No the solution seems to be simple - just forgo the BTC altogether and make satoshi the default base.
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:07:42
Ok. Thanks for your unbiased input.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:21:00
Again - expected inflation is priced in the interest rates offered so it really doesn't matter if it is set to 2% or any other number. The market debt offered will have it included so your hypothesis doesn't really hold any water.
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:44:02
Because you could be twice as rich when you win the bet.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:08:40
And how would that work with nothing to prove that allegation and such a huge amount of people protesting? 
People are capable of great sacrifices if they see something threatening their way of life.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:29:45
I'm not sure at all if the point of taxing the poor by devaluation is a valid one. Poor people do not hold assets nor money because well they are poor. They spend a huge proportion of their income on their needs hence it does not matter to them that the money will devalue in future.
There is a problem of sticky wages that do not increase linearly with inflation so that's a minus point but on the other hand any fixed rate loans taken that expect the inflation ot be lower than it is result in an actual gain to the loan taker. So actually if people would be taking out fixed rate loans and then there would be a massive devaluation it would result for a gain for the people and loss for the banks.
And finally - regulated financial institutions are not so good but ultimately it is the people taking out the loans and in comparison what happens in the payday loans business and other para-banking predatory lending is much much worse than what you describe and what can be expected to appear in an unregulated space. 
So all in all I do not think it's so easy as you describe it.

Not planning to and probably not going to. But if that's all you have as a proof of your opinion then it's not worth much.
