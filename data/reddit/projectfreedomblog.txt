The first part I submitted to Google: What would I want Google to do with Bitcoin?
The second part is a little melancholy, but I needed to get it out!
We'd love to have Google involved in as many payment options and apps throughout Google's platforms and networks as possible! (Adwords, GooglePlay, even code on the blockchain yourself for apps not even thought of yet, and if you can integrate with Gmail and GoogleWallet omg.) No matter what, your integration would be an amazing tipping point towards real change for the world and 100's of millions of us that long for a better, freer, more peaceful world with the opportunities we dreamt of as children. 
Then we began to awaken to the understanding of the true motives of a very small group of egomaniac men and how hard they've worked to tilt the table of world power in their favor from every direction, changing the rules of the game as they go, all while upsetting the natural balance of freedom, liberty, democracy, peace and happiness of much of the entire human race. Money is not the root of all evil, a few men are at that root, but money is and always will be power. Let's work together, to take some back from the few and put it into the hands of the many.

Please, you can't possibly feel (noticed I didn't use think - for good reason) the utility or usefulness of bitcoin, in this world, is the same as beanie babies or I could throw in tulips, another common response from the idiot population. God, if we could only "fix stupid" the world would be such a better place.
