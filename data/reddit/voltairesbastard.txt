If he really has 400+ million bucks in Bitcoin he will owe a heck of a lot more than 1.5 million in taxes. As soon as the Bitcoin are monetized that tax bill would sky rocket. If the Bitcoin were classified as income - then the tax office would be knocking his door asking for around $150 million. 
What he could possibly do is gift some bitcoin to a not for profit. This to to me seems like the best thing for him to do. Get a not for profit charity of his choice to open an e wallet then shift some early bitcoin in to it.

By 'profile' you mean him being American? There is an 80% chance CW is SN right now. Those claiming 100% he is a fraud are in denial. Most people simply cant stomach that CW is not American and doesnt have a perfectly pure personality.

Legal definition of a 'Trust' is entirely different. It means that for example a Trustee is appointed who controls the Bitcoin. Wright may be a beneficiary but the Trust Deed might have rules in place that the Trustee needs to follow. A beneficiary may have no control over the Trust assets - at least for some set period of time. The deed might say that the beneficiary (Wright) would have to go to Crt and show financial hardship for the Trustee to breach the Trust Deed and shift Bitcoin back to Wright. These things usually have a set time period. Say 10-20 years. After that the assets will be distributed back to the beneficiary - say Wright. But the Trustee may have more of an obligation to Wright of 2030 than Wright of 2016.
Of course Wright could be just speaking trash about the Trust because he knows a few basic things about the law and it is a convenient excuse for him to do nothing.

Both of these seem plausible to me. 1 actually seems quite plausible because it would help him have any fraud charges possibly dropped because he can argue that the R &amp; D expenditure was all legitimate and the Bitcoin funds kick started the business. He may still owe some taxes on those original Bitcoin transactions but owing tax is a lot better than being charged with fraud.

Adam Back must know who Satoshi is.

I will add one thing. While Wright's claims that Iceland has cheap power prices are indeed [true]( Guess what else is true about Iceland? [No extradition treaty with Australia](
Where I depart from the op is that I think it is still possible that Wright was BOTH Satoshi and defrauding the ATO. They are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Proving (or 'proving') he is Satoshi is not necessarily a defence for Wright because the ATO will still be able to show that Wright engaged in some deceptive conduct in relation to the R &amp; D credits.  If they can prove this - Wright is sunk for fraud anyway. Satoshi or no Satoshi. 
I think Wright is now hiding out in Iceland because he is cooked. It seems like a pretty clear case of tax fraud if you ask me.

Which is idealistic crap. Of course some people have at least some authority over it. They are selling the libertarian democracy utopia and some people are buying it but don't pretend it is perfectly democratic and egalitarian.
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:24:15
How is that rational? Ignoring something obviously of interest AND slavishly obeying some authority figure (Andreas). How is that 'rational'?
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:35:19
Alternatively you could have just gone, disproved his claims and then publicly explained your reasons for doing so.
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:20:56
Similar writing style if you ask me. And Matonis and Andresen have confirmed CW knew details from old private emails from Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-03 12:36:56
Great post. Most sensible I have seen on here.

He is clearly not an idiot either. He knows a fair bit about Bitcoin and also enough to run a fairly elaborate tax fraud for several years and apparently get away with it.
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:31:33
Essentially Andreas hid behind his ideology and abrogated responsibility to someone else. If CW is a fraud then Andreas could have intervened and shut it down and then publicized his reasoning. This would be far more valuable than doing nothing and merely writing a post on reddit.
If you ask me, Andreas sounds a lot like Wright in many things he says.

So Craig sets up company 'A'. Company A pays Company 'B' in Bitcoin (value of $1m) to undergo R &amp; D for Company A. Bitcoin is transferred from A to B. Craig then applies for a R &amp; D incentive recoupment. He provides receipts saying he paid out $1m for R &amp; D and applies for $400k cash back.
This is repeated for a few years. Then the ATO figure out that Craig also controls Company B. Hence they raid his house to look for proof connecting Craig to Company B and thus prove that he had fraudulently accessed the R &amp; D scheme.
Now I think it is more complex than this - but this is pretty much a simplified version of what I think has happened.
Now of course Craig might be both a fraudster AND Satoshi. I dont think the two are mutually exclusive.  Wright is certainly an ideologue and you can can tell he hates the government.
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:23:18
Surely it means something that CW extended this offer to Andreas? 
@_date: 2016-05-04 12:52:52
This is an excellent post indeed. Thanks for this. I think you are spot on about how Wright worked his R &amp; D scheme. I suspect he has now sold his assets in Australia shifted to Iceland where guess what?
[No extradition Treaty with Australia](

Andreas is right about the 'appeal to authority' as a logical fallacy and that it smells fishy that such a stunt was attempted.
Still - CW must have been very very confident if he invited Andreas. Andreas stating here that he WAS invited proves that Matonis and Andresen are not 'in' on some conspiracy. If CW was afraid of being caught out it is unlikely that he would have made this invitation to andreas in the first place. 
(I guess that's why they call them 'confidence' tricksters or the shorter version 'con' men.) 
@_date: 2016-05-04 11:42:26
Craig Wright has an ongoing issue with the ATO AND he is Satoshi. The two are not mutually exclusive. Your ridiculous theories about bribery are conspiracy nonsense.

Upvote for Shirley Maclaine. That is some very funny shit right there :-)
@_date: 2016-05-03 07:55:07
Isn't that exactly what happened? CW produced some old emails between SN and Jon Matonis? That is how I read it.
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:08:10
Have you considered the more likely fact that Wright is able to mimic Satoshi so well because guess what? He is Satoshi.
Seems like a lot of Americans are just trying to find ways for Satoshi to be American. Some real racial/patriotic bias at play imo.
@_date: 2016-05-04 01:47:42
Arrghhh Americans. None of you can handle that SN is not some crypto guru and not American so you look to somehow come up with some convoluted story to make SN American to makes yourselves feel better. Sometimes the truth hurts. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 10:04:16
Exactly. Because all of you little children want him to live up to your childish comic book fantasies. 
Wright's initial secrecy was largely driven by the desire to evade Australian taxation officials. Now Wright has sold up in Australia and moved his base to Iceland/UK he has less concerns about the Australian taxation authorities.  This is the cold hard reality. I know you would all like to think he is some comic book character who wants privacy because he is some buddhist crypto monk with no ego but that is merely a childish fantasy.
