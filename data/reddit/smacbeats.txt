You'll need a lot more than an i5 for half a coin a month aye. but you know this already.

The best way is to make a deposit into an exchanges bank account. 
Completely anonymous. 
The two exchanges I've used had mar ups of 4.0 &amp; 4.4% and accepted deposits at 3 major banks.

Fuck it, why not add RonPaulCoin, Potcoin and Mastercoin while they're at it!

I'm exactly 1 minute older than I was a minute ago! This is crazy guys!
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:02:20
Hmm interesting, thanks for sharing that.
@_date: 2014-01-11 06:28:20
Don't jump straight into things next time. Do a bit of research. Butterfly Labs offers 1 year contracts for $10.83 per GH/s(still pre-order, should be another week or so) and I believe Cex.io is about the same price.
@_date: 2014-01-11 06:05:02
Yes they did commit a crime but facing 15 years prison for what they did is far overkill. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:25:42
There are other as to measure a coins overall value. Also, there's no hard cap on many currencies.

Why would anything change as it is now? Newegg is a reputable company known for excellent customer service. If they send a faulty motherboard, you send it back to them and they refund you. I don't see how this would change whether it's USD or Bitcoin.

I've bought a few hot dog's from my local 7-11. They're very sub-par, and only remotely worth it when your balls to the wall drunk.
@_date: 2014-10-24 07:11:27
Maybe Bitcoin is flawed then.
@_date: 2014-02-02 07:40:46
I dunno about OP, but I get paid in cash ;)
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:15:39
Actually it's a fairly well known problem, and I've encountered it myself a few times as well.
Also, the apparent guideline the broke was " they may not include content that "enables, facilitates or encourages an activity" that some countries deem illegal."
Despite the fact that Bitcoin is not illegal anywhere, and it's just as possible to use a Chase app or PayPal app for the use of illegal activity(A erm, friend of mine, confirms he's done far more illegal stuff using PayPal than he has Bitcoin).
The actual real reason could be that Apple is simply being anticompetitive, though there's no definite proof of that

Get an offline wallet! It's the ONLY way to be 100% safe.

I think you missed that part.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:07:47
It's not derailing because it's a Doge comment, because Doge is relevant to this posting. If it's derailing at all, it's because his comment is a meme.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:55:33
Yep, it decreases the supply but the demand stays the same. Either way that's better for Apple. Sorry, I was being too pedantic.
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:46:49
Because he posted a .gif image? 
Get your head out of your ass.
@_date: 2014-08-28 09:08:10
I'm pretty sure he's saying he only wants to be around people who aren't going to ostracize him and throw him in prison. It's quite a reasonable desire.
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:40:40
Not really much else one can do is there?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:30:15
lolololol THIS guy XD
@_date: 2014-04-02 05:47:55
It's almost as if those are different voices. *gasp*
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:48:11
If they sell their phone on eBay - the demand decreases. If they smash their phone, the demand remains the same as it was before - unless there is evidence that these 5 people were already planning to sell their phone on eBay before this threads existence.
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:13:21
Audio production is garbage on Linux as well.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:56:45
How does it increase the demand for new ones? They're already getting new phones. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 09:01:19
Because he wanted a PS4, not a PC. Is it that hard to understand?

First world problems.

This is a Bitcoin subreddit meant to discuss Bitcoin, not to promote it(although that can be a secondary function)

Football always counts.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:53:00
Sorry, I misinterpreted what you said, I thought you were saying OP could be smashing someone elses device. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:12:56
They do in mine :'(

It's a meme - and it was a poorly executed one at that.

I have to admit I am worried about the operators of Mt. Gox.
There are going to be so many angry people, and it's not out of the question that there's at least one person who was tipped past the edge and may take attempts on their life.
Fuck those cunts, but I hope for their sake they're laying way the fuck low.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:10:07
They way I see it, it's no different than a typical Reddit pun thread or a circlejerk. Downvote and press the collapse thread button if it bothers you. Takes 2 seconds.

I was thinking drugs, but who knows?

Lmao I'm not going to lie - for some reason I envisioned a full on Yacht in my head before clicking in.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:30:58
It's all just a straight up good ole' fashioned scam.
@_date: 2014-02-23 05:11:01
That's a terrible excuse for anyone to downvote. Reddiquette bitches!
@_date: 2014-08-25 09:43:22
Good point. What are people thinking? 
I guess they will think they have the last laugh until they get done for tax evasion!

A bitcoin meme subreddit wouldn't be a bad idea. I would subscribe.

Same shit would have happened just earlier. Either way - shitload of people were going to lose money regardless. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:02:57
Fuck Mt Gox. Shifty motherfuckers.
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:33:17
Yeah, it simply is.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:10:15
When there were repeated warnings over and over again, day in and day out, that Mt Gox was in fact, shitty.
Justin Bieber is popular, doesn't mean he's any good.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:21:26
It's still the 5th biggest coin, that's pretty impressive.

Republicans, et al. are people joined together because of ideals. users are people who are joined together because they use bitcoin, some of those users have their own ideals.
Big difference.

Free money's free money. Even if BTC to USD drops, I'm in it for the BTC anyway.

Likewise was The Quran! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:20:48
I intend on it. I personally don't see 2x overtaking BTC. I believe the potential of a successful fork happening but I think it will have to see many years of development and planning to smoothly transition. 
I was just kinda baffled. Seems like I'm getting free money.
@_date: 2016-05-02 03:40:07
Why should I?
@_date: 2016-05-02 03:47:28
Hmm. Interesting response. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 03:32:11
Cut the superiority complex crap dude, you're not a moral authority, you're not a determiner of what is objective, you're just some guy on the Internet. You have opinions just like everyone else, and many people do not share the same opinions as you. This does not make your opinions more valid than theirs. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:39:39
I dunno i got kinda confused 
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:24:44
That's a different trial though, isn't it?

I bet you have a lot of friends.

Then don't buy PCP. Buy Molly. Who cares if the dealer goes into his own supply? The dude will just be loved up and give you extra
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:11:29
That's a terrible comparison.
Buying drugs from India is like watching a good Bollywood flic made on a $10,000 budget, and not going to see the latest Michael Bay movie.
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:29:33
Those were an extreme minority. Most people were buying a gram of meth or some molly and tabs.
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:17:26
This isn't about Ulbright though, this is about Silk Road. The actions of the founder are irrelevant to what Silk Road did.
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:13:41
It's kinda hard when those drugs are illegal and they can't perform much research. 
You're going to have to trust the overwhelming anecdotal evidence. 
Just because there hasn't been good scientific research and results in something doesn't mean it's bs. All it means is that there's no scientific proof.
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:23:53
Doesn't matter if people were pissed, they don't matter. The bankers were 'one of them' and Ross was 'one of us'. 
If the bankers were regular guys they would be getting time. If ulbricht was an elite, he would be getting minimal time if any.
