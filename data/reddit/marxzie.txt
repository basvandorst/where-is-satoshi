Dude, tell me just one thing: what has actually happened?
Can you tell me?
If they had anything real, they would be plastering every wall with it.
"Indictments" happened?
They keep repeating the lie, so that useful idiots keep believing the "big lie".

You are just throwing words around.
"Conspiracy against the US".
What the fuck did he do?
What? When? Where? Who? How?
You can't tell, and that is what makes you a manipulated fool.

You mean the massive Saudi financing of Hillary Clinton?
By the way: what exactly did the Russian hackers do? 
Is there any actual proof? I haven't seen anything substantial yet.

Let loose the Antifa!

Dude, just tell me what it was that happened?
If there is a conviction, there must be an accusation. We are not in Stalinist Russia yet.
What is the accusation?
You so sure, you just tell me here, boy.

If Bitcoin ever got genuinely dangerous to some powerful governments (you know who), some core developers would suddenly suffer odd "Mossad" accidents. The surviving others would just scram, not wanting to martyr themselves of course. The media would spin on orders from above, like they always do (terrorism, child pornography, drug trafficking, ...) - and the sheeple would not even look up on their way to their shearing.

You should cash out of the fiat system.
