the only 1 thing to point out, and that is there's a difference between alt to btc ratio than alt to dollar ratio.

140 bytes for opening a channel. $3.60 would be more accurate, 83 bytes for closing equates. about $1.60? $5 total. not bad
I pay that same amount monthly to my bank for having an account, on top of that business bank account owners pay for all transactions on top of that, excluding the subscriptions for payment methods.

To put it in a single sentence; These are off-chain payment settlements across lightning nodes.
It's like having Tor clients for bitcoin wallets. You open up a channel with a node and add some funds. When I make a lightning transaction, it will pick a path of max. 20 hops. So 0.1mMTC goes ME &gt;X&gt;Y&gt;Z&gt;...&gt;Destination

this could be a possibility. tax layer protocol, say for example over the first 20K you don't have to pay tax, for all transactions you do, no tax TX are made. after that x% goes to tax address. OR we could see a total political reform. Less central governance and more localised, because we won't need a central government when we do all the things ourselves

I've encountered some problem trying to send or spend the max amount on a channel.
I've gotten different results from using Eclair and HTCL wallets.    
and I think it has to do with the nature of the channel, as mentioned.    
What I tried was to send a large amount from my Eclair wallet to my HTCL wallet.  I wanted to try was [improper usage]( as a result 2 transaction are still pending, a couple failed to complete a route.
Does anyone know how to export the transaction history?

might as well throw a channel open with altcoin.io or zigzag for atomic swaps.
then you can buy crypto on the LN, completely decentralised.

some what like that. it's just 2 transactions. 1 opening with x and y BTC between you and me, and closing a channel with i and j BTC between you and me. doesn't matter if there were 100, 10,000 or 1,000,000 transactions in that time.
~~opening a channel or closing a channel is about 30/40 bytes. don't know the exact numbers, i heard it was something about that~~
opened Eclair; 149 bytes for opening a channel with 30mBTC funds; network fees 2.7 mBTC.    
took a couple of hours to get 6 confirmation.

While it maybe easy for us, new people have no clue in how many possible way you can lose your bitcoin, and what a responsible way is to securing them. Remember, the most used password is 123456

@_date: 2017-12-16 00:18:26
so answer me this. is [2MB for 300 transaction]( a good thing?
because someone is inflating the transaction blocks, and you'll be requiring bigger blocks in no time.


so, some kind of central company should run a node. thanks you for pointing that out. 
   
Maybe  if 1 company run all nodes, then it's easier for the merchant.

[I dind't zoom out]( looks like metcalfe's law. mining rigs are sold out the moment they're able to be ordered, every time.
when mining, transactions are floating in the mempool. and the highest fee (bidder) gets mined first. So when bitcoins get on the news, we see far more traffic than usual.(around [10-20K unconfirmed transaction is a calm day](

Is there not enough information how wallets work?    
Is it a problem if a user lost his funds because he didn't use 2FA, despite adviced to do so? (what happened pretty much in every crypto exchange)
Failing to do your homework will cost you money this time.    
People fail to see that, they don't seem to learn from so many other cases that have come before them.
Before buying a cryptocoin from a website, most of the sites come with a checkbox with a text something like "I understand the risks that are involved in cryptocurrencies and within the cryptocurrency space.     
something, something, security and personal responsibility"

that's why I think Litecoin is a good alternative, you can convert them back and forth to bitcoin almost costless with atomic swapping later on. 
Now if there was an entire exchange that handled cross-currency atomic swaps, there is 1 less exchange with a giant target  painted on it, because no coins are held there, or so I hope.

they'll ban you on r\btc for posting about BTCC in the hopes that people will see Bitcoin Core is not BTCC.
But Ver cannot play his broken record how bitcoin core is slow and has expensive TXs. The response would be: 1m block time and cheaper fees.
He'll probably call it Bitcoin Legacy, I can see fork coming called Bitcoin Legacy, which is also based on Bitcoin Cash.

Cause and effect; what causes Bitcoin from non-illegal asset to being illegal asset?
"what if it drops to zero?" something else rises? Balance is the keyword. Conditions have to be met before events will happen, a trigger is the cause for the event to unfold.
*If everybody stopped believing in god, they will blow themselves up because believe they won't go to hell.* (something I remember from an old old reddit post, big grain of salt needed)
What this illustrates, is it shows the person lacks the knowledge to understand a lot of factors.

Highly unlikely, but the case isn't about that, it's about loss of coins due to confusing addressing wallet addresses differently. It's a civil case. Each individual could still go to court. but then again, It could be denied because if you can't distinguish the two, it would be an irresponsible investment. What would be the most likely outcome.
This comes down to the earliest of statements, only invest what you're willing to lose. Meaning; Leaving it on an exchange where it can be stolen, losing coin by sending ti to the wrong address. Each element has their own weight. As you gradually get familiar, the amount you you can responsibly invest, increases.

crypto or not, people will fall for the same old scams, one after another.
We can provide information, but people have to be willing to search these things even if it would be easy to find. Today they expect thing to be handed to them, and things not to be their fault when they do something wrong.
If we're helpful, it's the reputation of the commuinty behind bitcoin that grows, but not bitcoin, or maybe a little?

You misunderstood what I meant.
Reducing the blocksize for Y months reduces the entire blockchain by  (724KB (30\*144)) Y for that period.
So if new node was about to start syncing *after* that period, it take less time to sync the data from that period compared to non-reduced blocks if we assume current average blocksize.
If a Ras-pi takes 20 days to sync 10 years of history. that means  25632 blocks per 24 hours.

not really the way you describes it big, but at least I know where to dig.
From the gist of it, it's about additional (hidden) fees.     
So, it would still be allowed to give discount if btc payments are less costly to process.  But have to get details of the EU rules apply for a more clear answer.
Buuuuuuuut, since you now have another extra payment option, and extra things that some with it, it wouldn't really save that much money unless more people started to use crypto payments. But that's a different issue

If you have a clean Linux install run in a Virtual environment you have an isolated environment create an image after doing the intial installs. so you don't need to do a clean install everytime you want to recover your seeds/private keys for example.
The awesome thing on the samurai wallet is that you can create an off-line transaction file. So this could be something close to a hardware wallet....    
or actually it's a Virtual Wallet.

0-conf is so secure, they're developing a security deposit for transactions for BCH. you're really locking out funds in bch compared to LN. I fyou compare it to LN if it were also a security depost.  you can spend your deposit.

then his patents only apply to BCH. That could mean you can use it on other coins, however it depends if the patent is written specifically for BCH. But in the same way you can avoid infringement depending *how* the patent is written. (finding holes) 
simplified example:     
Table patent 001 defenition; construction of square surface with supporting 4  upright standing legs.
And I'll be making a table with 3 legs, or with a single leg with a wide foot, or a round table, ect.    
 No patent infringement, can still make tables.
another thing, he's patenting technology that's already been made public.

this is why you first have to understand blockchain. If you understand crypto in general, you can see what thing a coin does , would a good idea or bad idea.
If you hodl crypto, it's in your interest for it to improve if you want it become more valuable.
if the network need more nodes, you run a node to strengthen the network and consensus.     
This is opposite to what everyone is claiming in bitcoin cash, only miners should run nodes. That means only miners get to vote on the consensus.     
0 confirmation was also abandoned here. On cahs they promote it. meanwhile there are daily "double spendings" on their chain. you still think those are great ideas?

if you want the cheapest $/tx there are plenty of other possible methods for doing cheap transactions.
among them would be a coinbase to coinbase transaction, or physical cash transaction, even bank transactions.
on-chain transactions should be reasonably priced, because validation by miners are necessary, and the difficulty should also remain high enough. **Currently** receiving the block reward is enough to keep it going, but will be reduced. At some point the total mount of fees should be high enough to be sustainable for miners.

if bigger blocks were the answer, any of the thousands of other altcoins would now be worth more that bitcoin, yet bitcoin is worth more than all of them combined.


I can see you don't quite understand decentralisation, or aren't even running a full node.
There no use in trying to convince people to increase blocks because you can use 3000 other projects that have unlimited onchain scaling solutions. This discussion had its outcome, what's the point of bringing it up?
\[edit\] more things
Let me explain consensus really simple;
* Step 1: suggest a blocksize increase with the devs on github
* Step 2: have them agree
* Step 3: write the change
* Step 4: commit change to the client
* Step 5: wait for everyone tho run new client
* Step 6: network has new blocksize
the first 4 steps were skipped by creating a different client, so step 5 didn't work out as expected,  aaaaand step 6 never got through.
you've got to convince about 100K client users, and they're convinced on your opinion.

You can already install a bitcoin client on a tv or on a NAS so in that aspect yes, transaction will never be free on the blockchain, transaction will be cheap on the layer***s*** above. Fees create incentives. Incentives keep the network running. free, no. acceptable, yeah.


try this [link]( and see for yourself


$45K-$60K would be the new dropped 86% but I'm not sure it will be within 5 years, but then again, my assumptions were always wrong, and bitcoin outperformed every expectation I ever had.

There's where you're wrong kiddo. increasing the blocksize is the easy answer, but the easy answer is not always the right answer. 
Lightning Network could multiply the transactions per block by 1000, we can have 100K transactions per minute. Meanwhile BCC had an 8MB block with only 2K transactions.

growth of bitcoin is like network growth or as some say, Metcalfe's law.
a lot of crazy talk suddenly doesn't seem so crazy anymore. Also put into perspective that bitcoin isn't like anything else, it's new and it's disruptive.
now, there are events that will set back the momentum, for example things like MtGox. B2X could trigger a similar event. The closing of an exchange in china had a similare effect, but then Japan added a new one. So, more player only increase the value. And we're still not at 1% world market cap.

@_date: 2017-11-29 21:25:34
sorry for the delay.  
Good question, designing semi-conductors is a multi year process. So the hardware follows Moore's law, the growth of hashing doesn't look like a hyper/parabole(yet), but you can see a slight curve in the hashing power graph.
and you also have take into consideration that people are more likely want to buy coins rather than mine them.  
as to what is my best guess.

no, it was coordinated by the miners that wanted to push bitcoincash. I think the sudden drop in hashing rate caused huge fee spikes. among things that happened.
essentially they were giving up a fortune waiting to be mined. So instead, one of those miners has accumulated  1million BCH and isn't doing so well.

start of by buying small amount like $10 of bitcoin.     
put it in a wallet.    
sent it to another address.(one you own)    
export a private key.    
import a private key.     
import a wallet on a different device.    
see coins being spent from your wallet from a different device.    
give someone some coins on a paperwallet.
you are ready.

I'm not including prices, the prices is something extra that the site comes up with, you can ignore the costs. What I'm looking at capacity requirements.
50TB a year, maybe in a few years you can get your 10 TB disks, but the amount of required storage keeps growing. 1GB blocks, meaning 300K transactions every 10 min., are their claimed Visa capacity.     
Even if you have a 400Mbs down speed, your up speed would be 1/10^th (that's the thing of ADSL), a 400Mbs would take 600+Hrs to sync up. Like I said, the growth of Fibreglass is too slow, for everyone to run a full node. 
That is if and/or when they reach that level.     
and I'm also being generous with the limits, if I increase the number of nodes it would take even longer and require more up speed.

ok, so let's look at it from a different perspective. I think you have a point.
 There is a problem with gathering (the right) information.    
and a new buyer isn't very technically proficient and not a master of Google-Fu.
A pattern emerges;     
Lost or Stolen keys, Due to forgotten passphrase or poor security.
As bitcoin is growing Bitcoin.org needs to be updates more often.     
There is a lot of info needed to learn and info gathered in a single place and well explained, because there's is so much and someone might get too overwhelmed by the amount

I think it has to do with nature of a segwit address that are incompatible  with forked addresses.
segwit adress start with 3 or bc1, old bitcoin adresses start with 1, addresses starting with that 1 can be moved on the fork without any problems. segwit addresses don't exist in forks so they can't be moves because the network don't see them as valid addresses.

well, the deal with consensus is you are not speaking on behalf of everyone.
Not rushing things is a trade off I have no problem with, this how I see it, and apparently I'm not the only, nor are you with yours. So those who wanted bigger blocks, created thousands of altcoins with bigger blocks. If you want Bitcoin to have bigger block, you need to convince me  and thousands of others to run a different client. And you have to make a very compelling argument. The smallest amount of doubt will still lead someone immovable.
Good luck telling everyone something they don't already know.

Then don't expect rushed decisions, and what the things in the previous comment. Bitcoin is secure because of that.
High fees, more reward. More rewards,more miners. More miners, more security.

there a lot more people not on twitter nor on reddit.
What they do thought was that Roger was one of the bitcoin founders. It was on the news that he sold a large portion of his Bitcoins. But that's people not paying attention or understanding  what's said. It's true he's the founder of bitcoindotcom. But in their short attention span they forgot Satoshi is the creator.
Their info comes from mainstream news, not social media, or some bitcoin website.
If they buy bitcoin it's because they also want those gains.
@_date: 2019-04-08 12:36:00


that's not how blocks work
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:57:54
I don't need to "defend", if you want big blocks you need to convince me I should run a node with big blocks.
The bitcoin is secure because it didn't increase the blocksize, and I don't see a need for it just because bitcoin entered a hype cycle.
There are no benefits to short term thinking. that's my view and gave that exact answer multiple times, the reason we here have the same answer is because we've come to the same conclusion at when we saw Bitcoin for what it means.
you're parroting the average bcasher yourself. "just increase the blocksize" with typical concern trolling. you still don't know what makes bitcoin have the largest network or what why it's secure. If you did, you know why raising  its blocksize is foolish.
just  use an alt mr "maximalist", you have your forked coin you wanted.  And now you want Bitcoin to be the same because nobody is using the fork? it doesn't work like that . It's very telling that you don't understand this.
Go watch some Andreas Antonapoulos videos like "Keeping communities weird" maybe then you at least get why it doesn't work like that.

the blocksize will in crease eventually, but as the very last option.
Syncing takes about month on a cheap laptop, now imagine how long it would take if the blockchain was 4TB like Ethereum.
so yeah, blocksize increasment is the very last option.

You can call it the science approach. Now take a religious person, he does the opposite. He call a thing whatever he thinks it is, other should call the same thing what he calls it. You could call, it the religious approach.

I already did, even gave you an example. And the decision is not only for me to make. Everyone has to agree with that change and nobody will at the time. as I said before, come up with a solid argument why it's a good idea to up the blocksize. So far you've only shown you don't fully grasp the trade offs or why people are conservative about these changes.

users maybe,  for now 90% used as a speculative (long term) investment/trading.
miners... only if they have a PoW that required GPUs, with ASICs you're bound by the hashing algo. so there's isn't a lot of moving space.
The world has lived with a deflationary currency longer than a inflationary currency, and we got by fine. we had wars, we had disasters, markets were running, and people also paid taxes under deflationary money.
I could also point out to Venezuela why inflation won't work. Germany also had its share of hyper inflation. ect ect

as far as the bank records should go, it's just money moving from one account to another.
Now for the trade to complete Bisq would have to see this bank transfer. meaning in the description for the transfer you're suppose to write a hash(signature), the other part uses the hash to [finalise the transaction.](
All the bank sees in their records is you sending money to another person and a hash in the comments. 
I think this could lead to more online transactions becoming anonymous. Even if you didn't purchase crypto. This is actually the best part, now that I think of it.

software where you store your coins are called wallets.
after installing you are given 12 or 24 words as means of recovery/backup. Coins are always on the network, your wallet is the one that has access to them. When exporting the private (security) key, you can get access to them from another program to the same wallet when you import the private key.

creation date of paper wallet.    
You need to look a bit deeper in how a wallet works. It's not just a number that's being added to your own. It's the history of the coin that came to your wallet. something like that.
the syncing is automatic when you import the private key.

It's easier to see what can be decentralized if you break it down to components and try to fit them into a whole again.
*The things that could be decentralized in my workspace*
There's already one way they do to decentralize it; the government segments the project. I'm currently working such a project. Instead of doing an entire highway, it split up in segments, and after each segment, the new segment is open for new bids. This increases the likelihood that the entire project isn't build by a single contractor.
Geodata already is freely available and maintained (because you pay taxes). Openstreetmaps is ok, but the accurate drawings are still in hands of the government. So the world geodata is something that can be improved in the decentralization space.
Arc software;opensource CAD software is improving, but it has a lot of catching up to compare to the commercial software. So far I encounter several projects that have been done with Revit. What could be decentralised with that? BIM solutions could have Dapps.  When someone needs schematics, they access the BIM through their Dapp. There's a a lot of possibilities in this space.
Some things would be easier to decentralize than other parts.
This is an interesting exercise

free coins already lost in fees, is what I'm saying.
unless you already had bitcoins long before the fork.
most exchanges dropped S2X. so the extra coin will be harder to sell.

coinbase also provides a link to see the transaction on the blockchain.

no, you keep it!
the public key is what you use to send bitcoin to and to check on the blockchain. you can find that public address on blockchain.info.
the private key, is what you use to import into your wallet, like electrum. Syncing can take some time depending on how long you keep it off line.  Had imported a 3 year old private key once, took a day or so.

1 bitcoin forked gives you $100 worth of bitcoin gold, and dropping.
but you're roo late. not sure what price S2X coin will be. probably less.
So you want to spend $5700 only to get $100? transaction fees from buying, selling and withdrawing will cost about the same price.

how do you want to trade something that holds no value? 
Bitcoin must be known as something that has value, and is a great store of value.

well, bit too late, here everyone already knows about bitcoin, but don't *fully* understand it. They know it's volatile, and seems for most risky. Business news channels are already discussing aware about more millennials are into crypto. 
Governments are there to bailout banks. If people invest money into crypto unwisely, let's say some thought it would be a great idea to get a €100K  loan on  btc, only to lose it. Banks aren't seeing any of that money back. This would be worse than sub-prime mortgages. And Govs don't want to bail out banks again. 
After the economic crash, banks have been on a tighter leash in europe. But this is about *the governments* informing people. *Not* the banks.

I doubt the end result will be anything dramatic or "big".
"If were to buy bitcoin on exchange A,B,X and Y, why will I get? BTC or BCH"
It will come down to what the majority thinks Bitcoin is, and the responsibility you have  as a software developer and or platform operator. Your customers are your responsibility. If they manage to lose their coins because they didn't warn them not to send btc to a bch wallet and visa versa, that's on them.

More people should use Bitcoin(XRP) with low fees. Coin prices doesn't really matter, because you will buy your bitcoin(GGD) on some exchange after sending some funds (can take a while) and then send it to your wallet so you can finally buy that thing from the internet, so the merchant can sell those bitcoins(BCC) on the exchange for money again.

It show the transactions as a stack. 2000 transactions paid 1sat/b another 2000 paid 2sat/b only 1500 transactions paid more than 10 Sat/b.
Each block holds about 3000 transactions.  So the first block transactions are the top 3000 fees, and then going downwards.
You could  place a 30Sat/b transaction if you want to be sure your transaction is placed within the first block. 20 Sat/b also has a very big change to be included, 10 Sat/b maybe, but also has a chance of being in the second block.

bigger block means more bandwidth usage.  [30 min video with very detailed explanation](
At it's current state, it's not problem, anyone can run an ABC node. Bigger  blocks mean more transactions that fit in each block, however, the bigger the block ,the more bandwidth is required to run a node. Depending on certain types of cable placed in the ground and some other variables, determines your maximum internet speed.  Say a block becomes 100MB, that mean you should be able to download 100MB and upload 100M to 50 or 60 connecting nodes within the block time (avg. 10 minutes)

sound very much like using a credit card, treat it the same way, use on $20+ payments
For now that is the case. it's also not possible to do micro-transactions on the blockchain. No point to aim for $2 purchases with that in mind. This is why there's lightning channels. For highly fragmented transaction, Schnorr can cut those costs in half. But that's all in the future. I mean you can already try Lightning transactions, but you have to keep in mind it's still in beta. Some are willing to take those risks.
the upside is we can have far more tps with those channels.

instead of bitcoin, they should do a video on fiat money first.

maybe we could describe it in a different way, it would be easier to understand.
'*Bitcoin is both a* ***digital*** ***currency*** *and a* ***payments network',*** this is as tl;dr as it can get.
So now it's clear you are about to describe two subjects, and those subject can be broken down further.That way it's easier to digest the information, but it will also make it easier to explain.

you can purchase goods with points. Meaning you can buy things with something that isn't money, but has value. a Dollar is for example is a x^th share of a gold brick, go back  further, coins used to be made from gold, silver or bronze. 
Currencies are connected to the gold reerve a country has in it's vaults, they represent a gold share. that was my view on the definition of money.
