Bitpotato nor coinbomb have ads.  I don't play games like SatoshiDice, poker, (idk if there are ads there) or others like that.  Anything that depends on chance generated by a computer is a losing battle and I will never play those types of games.  Bitpotato relies on real people buying at the designated price and it is easy to see patterns on there.  Losing money on that site is rare unless you're dumb/greedy.

I first installed it more than a year ago, then lost interest in it.  Then got back into it around 4-5 months ago.

I have a legit copy of windows.  An example of the password used for the wallet's encryption had the format of $password45782&amp;.
 
 
I am 90% sure i did not leave it mounted overnight.  I always have unmounted the volume as soon as I was done using the wallet. I tried looking at wireshark, but couldn't find any ftp or smpt information that a wallet stealer may use, but I'm not exactly sure what I should be looking for.
 
 
The default router password is changed. WPS is disabled on my router. WPA2 password encryption.  I also live the in the country so there are no neighboring connections around for another 3000 feet or so.

The only 2 folders on the truecrypt volume are Bitcoin and Litecoin.

I live alone off campus.  I never take my laptop anywhere because the shell can't close and I don't want to be laughed at for how it looks with clothes hangers duct taped for support.  The hinges wore out and could no longer be tightened. But hey, at least it works.

Definitely will if there even is a next time.

You can get a free student edition of the latest release from the Autodesk site.  If you make or print anything there are watermarks signifying that it isn't a commercial version.

There is 0.009389 BTC left in my wallet as of now.

After a little researching, [I found this exists](  This could easily be binded with a keylogger and then used to gain access to one's wallets. But I have no idea if this would search for locations other than the default directory.  The only thing I have downloaded in the past week is the new "The Office" and "Community" episodes that weren't even played on my pc, but off of a USB on my Xbox.

How would that look in a log file?

I only have one wallet per BTC and LTC on one computer with no phones with access to it.  All my previous wallet backups are stored on an encrypted USB drive.  I was using the default bitcoin and litecoin wallets as pictured in the transaction details picture.
@_date: 2013-05-13 03:22:51
Used bitcoin-qt and litecoin-qt.  For the wallets, those encryption passwords were from memory.  The truecrypt password, I always copied and pasted the password from a text file, on a USB drive, inside a password protected winrar file, inside of a password protected winrar file, inside of a password protected winrar file, totaling 3 different password protected rars to reach the .txt file.

I have linux dual booting off of a second hard drive, from now on I will use it for all my cryptocurrency needs.

I haven't nor will I ask for donations. This truly sucks for me, but I only want to find out how this happened.  I wish I could see the code/method used for educational purposes.  Fuck people who steal.  I strive for bitcoins and litecoins to gain popularity among the masses and become an accepted currency in societies eyes. The more thieves we have in the cryptocurrency scene, the less likely people will use it.

I wish my pc was a gaming pc. I mainly use Windows for AutoCAD and other school related stuff. 
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:15:09
Nope, I only use/trade BTC and LTC.

I could care less about being tipped or about being believed. It was an expensive lesson learned. Wouldn't the normal person be a little depressed losing $1000? I'm not going to kill myself over something as meaningless as money.  I came here looking for possible explanations.  Nothing more.  
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:59:30
No way possible that could have happened.  
@_date: 2013-05-13 03:04:15
I've thought about it!

The 0.626 BTC was for buying the gigaton bomb on coinbomb for 0.625 BTC and a 0.001 transaction fee, then when someone bought it, I received 1.25 BTC (100% interest).

I figured if I was ever the victim of a wallet stealing program, implementing a dummy in the default location would fool it and upload it, rather than my real one, to the attackers choice, but I was wrong.

They've always paid out instantly in the past and even given refunds within 12 hours if there was a problem due to a bug on their site. Not ruling it out though.

No one but me has physical access to my computer.  No one I know in real life even knows/understands what cryptocurrency is.
