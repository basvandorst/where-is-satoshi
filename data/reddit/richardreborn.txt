LMAO! This made my morning. 
We need a BTC Marsellus Wallet.

Not yet... looks like there's issues. Bcash is behind 10+ blocks and can't seem to mine their first.

Ahh thanks for explaining that, makes sense. Guess I'll sit here with my coffee...almost as exciting as watching paint dry.   -.-

No fork yet. BCash can't seem to mine the needed block to fork. They are behind 10+ blocks, there might be issues...

It will go sideways until the volume goes up.

Was just about to ask. Thanks!

Some reasons I've seen on here. 
1. Due to it being a "backroom deal" instead of it being a consensus. 
2. It's rushed after SegWit was activated (3-4 months?), which doesn't give enough time for everyone to upgrade their nodes.
3. No replay protection in BTC1 (2X).
There are a few other reasons that I can't remember off the type of my head. 
My question is why not do it safely now? Lets get the ball rolling to get replay protection implemented, have an agreement with everyone to scale up for a limited time. We can later have the blocksize decrease again once the LN is implemented.

The issue with that is that I've noticed many people just follow without a full understanding of both sides (HF vs SF/UASF). I've watched a few Bitcoin interviews/debates where someone strongly believes that a HF isn't the way to go, but when the technical person tries to explain their view and debate about it, the non-technical person can't seem to keep up and instead just reference to what others have told them. 
It's almost like some people just don't want to hear/listen/understand the other side because they have so much vested into what is currently in place and a HF would devalue their standing.

Times like this I wish the creator Satoshi would pop up and drop a hint of advice. I understand there's no "main decision maker", but I'm sure his input/analysis would at least have some value. It may even get both developing sides to join and weigh the pros/cons for the greater good of Bitcoin.
From reading and researching it seems that Satoshis original idea was to keep increasing the block size if we ever ran into these congestion and high fee issues. I also found that initially there were multiple hard forks in the past to increase the block size to where we are at today. But in my personal opinion, the Bitcoin volume has been skyrocketing within the past year or two and there is now a great deal of peoples money invested (not too much of mine) in BTC that aren't as technically advanced (me being one) as others, and are risking to lose it all due to the lack of knowledge/understanding of how a HardFork may affect them.
With that said, for now I would have to agree with the majority of and Core that HardForks should only be done as a last resort, at least until the digital currency is established as the norm of currency.  There will be a time in the future when the majority of the population will have a better understanding of hardware wallets, hard forks/soft forks, etc... and would be able to make a "better" educated decision of how to proceed with these type of situations.
Just my 2 cents.

Edit: I take that back. Works for me.

Congrats on the setup! 
I can only answer 3 of your questions. I'm not sure about the rest, maybe someone else could chime in.
1. No, the wallet in core is not actually used for Lightning. Lightning Nodes have their own wallet, the full node is just used for validating transactions and getting updates.
2. Yes. You'd be unlocking your LN wallet so that it may be funded/used. There is a script that can be used to auto unlock at startup. [
3. p2wkh: Pay to witness key hash. In short, the command generates an encrypted address. Yes, you can generate a new address as needed.
