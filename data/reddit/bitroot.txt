Do NOT tip this fellow. The title is a carbon copy of this post in bitcoinmarkets:
He got tipped there so must have thought that he'd try again here.

Sounds like barter. Hellooo, bitcoin is a medium of exchange. No need for barter.

No, no, no! Bitpay is in the business of processing bitcoin payments. It is NOT going to speculate on the price of bitcoins by holding on to them. That would be a very bad sign for all its stakeholders.

How much do they pay you?

You get paid that much by bank of america to troll sites? No wonder the banks are failing.

Ah, but it is! Even spending 1 minute is speculating. 
Merchants use bitpay for three main reasons. First to offload the exchange rate risk. Second to get paid in fiat. Third to offload the legal risk. If bitpay isn't able to manage the exchange rate risk it can no longer provide merchants the service they need.
Edit: They probably use hedging contracts to minimize exchange rate risk.

Which is down because difficulty is still increasing because miners have found new efficiencies. As long as mining is so profitable the price will keep falling. Satoshi himself predicted that the price will drift towards cost of production.

There was also the time neo bee took over the frontpage. It later turned out to be a scam.
