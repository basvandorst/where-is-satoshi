You misunderstand, people shouldn't have had their bitcoin on exchanges to begin with and they knew that. They also weren't sure what the vulnerability was, and many people find the unknowns to imagine that bitcoin is built on a house of cards and ANY vulnerability could be the lurking vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol itself that allows a thief to steal from everyone and try to make as much as possible.
As I mentioned, there was only a subset that of people that actually tried to sell for fiat and send money to their 'safe bank'. Those people made a mistake. They ran for one of two exits, and it was the wrong one.

Every time I see Jay, one of their main evangelists, there are snickers in the audience
Sure *maybe* he does improv on the side, or they see him as the face of Blockstream and everything it represents
Hate isn't the accurate word, I think people appreciate their stewardship of the protocol, their twilight zone ideology is amusing, at the very least
Here in the valley they are *just* another company except with a funding model that is incompatible with what they need to do. In this case, the conflicts of interest are pretty clear but bitcoin the network and asset class come with no statutory mandates to disclose conflicts. If they need to become a zombie subsidiary of Redhat to develop an open source protocol, then great

Yeah looking at those addresses, it seems like the hack has been going on for a while.
Bitfinex had no way to know that funds were being moved around between multisig addresses, or siphoned away by the hacker. With valid signatures from both Bitfinex and BitGo, it would have no way to know that their users were not signing the transactions themselves, without a better more meticulous implementation.
P2SH.info only lit up because they decided to move them out of multisig addresses.

not sure where to start
basically in the original implementation it was possible to accidentally uncolor coins
secondly, after several wallets and services came out to make them easier to use, a different steward came out under the COLU name and it broke compatibility with all other colored coin implementations
So now there are multiple colored coin wallets that can all uncolor each other, let alone the everyone using non-colored coin bitcoin wallets
Any the feature set is years behind protocols like Counterparty and OMNI, despite being the same age
Yeah I would just call it failed. It had potential since you didn't need an intermediary token, but really XCP is good enough since you also don't need intermediary tokens most of the time.

I've been following this development for several years and I don't consider this a problem until a significant portion of corporate and municipal bonds are also negative yielding.
Government bonds are negative yielding, and they are very liquid. So the deeper the negative yield goes, the greater your profit and ability to sell to another person at that higher price.
In government bonds, the majority of the profit never ever ever came from the yield. Whether it was in your managed retirement plan account, or an investment banker making trades. Sure, the one your relative might have gifted to you a long time ago is pretty boring and making only a few pennies through the course of your life time, but thats not how government bonds really work.
When a bond yield goes lower that means the bond price has gone up. The majority of the profit over the last few decades has always been in CAPITAL GAINS from the bond, not the interest rate itself.
Outside of government bonds, corporate and municipal bonds are harder to find another buyer for, so you really would be locked in to the rate you get. But corporate and municipal bonds aren't trading negative yields just yet, spare only a very few issuances, such as Apple's Swiss Bonds.

well first, let's work on the terminology:
where is non-offshore in this context? The leaks detail clients from practically every country in existence.
secondly, people use the capabilities of one jurisdiction because a local jurisdiction doesn't offer the same capabilities. It is really as simple as that.
Thinking about the "why" is pointless. New York says your new business entity has to have your name and address in public records while Wyoming, Panama, Delaware, and the Cayman Islands say you don't. If you think "one of those jurisdictions is not like the other" then you are wrong. Some jurisdictions invite more stigma than the others, but the main takeaway is that nobody needs to even know to stigmatize you, because your name isn't in the public records.

is this really productive? I mean, it could
a solar powered array in the sahara can mint some new bitcoin
mining cooperatives can have anonymous shareholders or recipients
the person that owns the private key of the recipient address doesn't have to be the person that owns the mining hardware
if done right and using the best practices that we push for normal use, nobody would know that the attack was funded by digital assets
even if that happens that doesn't make bitcoin or distributed ledger digital assets bad
but it is disingenuous to pretend suddenly thats its not a trojan horse on their ability to control transactions, the point is for the state to be unable to leverage financial intermediaries to propel their interests. if there is an actual behavior they want to stop, like terrorism, then they have to do actual investigations instead of using their paranoia as a pretext to control everyone's assets

Secondly, the SEC was not formed to judge the merits of investments. They exist to promote standards of disclosure. Congress did not ask them to judge an investment ever, that is left up to the investors who have proper disclosures. It is an accident that they do this with ETFs (due to the complexity of ETFs and the variety of rules they conform with), Congress has never looked at the issue.

General ownership and use:
Allow people to characterize any transaction related to a distributed ledger technology any way they want. This is how business between two parties is conducted: one person decides that consumptive spending was a deductible expense, and the government checks to see if the other person found that to be an income producing event. That relies on self reporting and voluntary compliance, with the understanding that a mismatch will result in the need for clarification and potential penalties.
Recommend that for easier accounting, people should use difference addresses or wallets for their investing, consumptive spending, and business endeavors. The same recommendation given to people for their bank accounts.
This is primarily distinctive from a blanket assumption that a whole asset class should be subject to consumptive taxes or capital gains.
Regarding mining bitcoin being a public utility:
Go further and propose that any action to secure a digital ledger technology should be categorized as a public utility and tax free, if that's the theory you want to go with. 
Digital Assets representing private ventures:
The holistic solution here is based around the point of consumer and investor protection. Securities regulations do not protect token owners whether they are enforced or not. So therefore, simply make it easy for someone that wishes to register a tokenized project under Finnish securities laws, and make that have more advantages, with the contrary not being punishment. Distributed Ledger Technology allows for efficient issuance of dividends and instant reporting of large movements of funds. This lowers the compliance and regulatory costs for issuers and for the government regulator and investors. A better use of public resources would be the creation and promotion of open source smart contracts to help the industry and promote investment into the space, so a recommendation. Smart contracts promote investment. The ERC20 token standard ratification promoted billions of dollars of investment, eclipsing VC capital even in AMERICA. Tell them that. What if the standard was assisted by the Finnish government, and common paper contracts were re-coded on various blockchain platforms? It would lower the cost for all issuers and promote cutting edge skillsets in Finland.
Utility tokens. Yes there needs to be regulatory clarity that people can issue tokenized products without running afoul of broken securities laws. There needs to be regulatory clarity that licensed financial professionals can trade these things too. Suggestion: say 'licensed financial professionals can trade tokenized assets that settle on distributed ledgers regardless if they are registered securities or not securities at
all', if there are broker-dealer license equivalents in finland, thats what it needs to say.
If there are regulations around exchanges or secondary markets of assets, exempt them totally because the distributed ledger technology already fulfills the role that the securities regulator wished for. Suggestion: Make it clear that issuers of securities or utility tokens can talk about their secondary markets, pursue the markets, and make it clear that existing licensed markets can trade utilities tokens and securities tokens at all, and also on behalf of clients.
Banks and other licensed financial institutions can find it convenient not to service digital asset related accounts under the guise of compliance issues.
The reality is that this technology can compete with them and they are being anti-competitive. 
Solution: Endorse that banks will service crypto accounts. An endorsement from the government goes a long way but is only a partial solution. Give assurance to banks that they won't be sanctioned for flow of funds on distributed ledger technologies. The government can say they are doing all the AML/KYC with chain analysis techniques. Aim for a total exemption from sanctioning when a customer is using distributed ledger technology.

you can change whatever you want in bitcoin-core and try to get people to use it
if people do, then the core devs will have to accept that their version of bitcoin is obsolete and either adopt your code or walk away
a subversive hard fork is inevitable at some point in bitcoin's future (whether it happens on this block size issue or not), there is no reason to dance around the issue. It can cause a temporary disruption in the ability to transact and it may cause a large drop in the exchange rate and confidence. Bitcoin will retain its utility and the fork may have added more utility.

There is a pervasive misconception that apps "do better" on iphones, when the reality is that there are many many different business models and metrics. This misconception is regurgitated by many companies offering iphone products and considering android an afterthought, basically failing at marketing.

explain the economic argument that the tokens will increase in value? I better go screenshot this from the FoamSpace website
"Foamspace Coin is a token of community membership that will grow in value over time. The coin brings access to the initial fund and is a means of decision making".
"Register for a digital wallet and receive a Foamspace Coin. Then you will receive dividend payments in the form of Proposal and Vote tokens at a later date"
I think it is interesting. Just some things seem ... 'regulatorily unsound'
Which part grows in value, the foamspace coin dollar value? Will there be a demand for where the fund will create things? I've seen something like this, where buying shares of an exchange let you dictate what gets listed on that exchange. So companies would include that in their initial capital requirements "enough money to buy listing on the cryptoequity exchange"
So perhaps if an artist wanted to get their idea built, they could obtain enough foamspace coins or buy proposal and vote tokens.

The open assets protocol has existed since late 2013. "Colored coins" are the outcome of what the open assets protocol does.
The purpose is to create decentralized exchanges, like decentralized stock exchanges, but not just company shares, any kind of asset. This is one of several technologies to do this.
The way the open asset protocol works is that bitcoins are marked as being associated with a certain asset. The idea is that when the bitcoin is traded, the mark stays with it. Hence the term "color". The coin has been colored.
There are a lot of pros and cons between protocols like Counterparty. 
The pro is that they didn't issue an additional coin or crowdfund something to create it.
The con is that they are very limited in functionality, compared to a platform like counterparty which is capable of greater scripting capabilities allowing for smart contracts and derivatives on the blockchain.

I don't anymore as new information and protocols have appeared that make it apparent that the bitcoin unit itself won't need to attract investment to work or be successful. 
Open Assets and Counterparty can infinitely dilute capital into bitcoin, can be used with centralized intermediaries to facilitate fiat trades, and still retain the security of bitcoin's blockchain.
I have sold 98% of my bitcoin on this information. The promise of equities, bonds, smart contracts and everything was the real driving force of capital into bitcoin. This promise has been fulfilled and the way it has been done means that nobody needs to buy bitcoin at a higher price than the next person.
Similarly, even if hundreds of thousands of people had addresses with open assets in them, and just enough bitcoin for a transaction fee, this would not offset the block reward for many years. Eventually it could help scarcity, but no time soon. Also, a trusted intermediary can trade private keys for instant transactions (meaning that the address doesn't even need to have any bitcoin in it, MAYBE just one satoshi for the open assets).
Current speculation in bitcoin is based on the idea that irrational investors are right around the corner. The reality is that the market is choosing the least expensive ways to utilize bitcoin's blockchain and security. I expect the bitcoin unit to become cheaper as this information becomes more widely known.

I ran the numbers of how high of an exchange rate is necessary, and it is a lot lower than this! A lot of unprofitable miners can drop out of the network and we would still have a robust, equally as secure, blockchain.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:58:05
With the current information available, yes this is a likely outcome. But new information can come a long to change that.
Basically, the market realization is that nobody, from individuals or large companies, need to buy bitcoin at a higher price than the next person, because there are other cheaper ways to build on top of the blockchain.
ie. *Is the decentralized currency too expensive?* ***Issue a centralized one secured by the decentralized blockchain, with equally as "instant" transactions***
All this transaction clutter, that doesn't move much of a single bitcoin, will just diminish perceived greater demand for an individual bitcoin.

So after all of this you still don't realize that the SEC enforcement action had absolutely nothing to do with a federal judge recognizing bitcoin as money?
Like, at no point during the settlement process did the SEC or your lawyers point you to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which gives the federal government and that agency jurisdiction over entities that offer certain financial services to Americans in interstate commerce? Like, having nothing to do with the currency used, at all? 
Your whole website was based on the same shaky legalese that many people tried to warn you about before the federal government even batted an eye at bitcoin, so I thought after your "entertainment purposes" disclaimer proved both hilariously worthless and expensive, after your nominal offshore incorporation proved both worthless and expensive, you would have come out of this with some worthwhile legal knowledge.
Not "ah an unrelated random activist federal judge changed the course of history and provided the framework for the SEC to come after me!" Nope, nope nope! They could have come after you in 1934 as much as 2013

the law is different in all 50 states, and the federal government also has its own statutes, where some very similar actions are civil crimes, others are criminal charges.
what exact answer are you looking for. You have a presupposition you are trying to prove "its not illegal I won't be charged with anything", how specific does it have to get before it effects you? In Florida, cops may bust into your home and hold you at gun point, you will get thrown in jail, you will have all your motions for freedom dismissed, and MAYBE a jury won't convict you of anything some years later reinforcing your idea that it is "not illegal" in Florida. Okay, go sell bitcoin in florida then.
FinCEN gives a $1000 exemption before you have to deal with that regulatory overhead. That is the only absolute worth mentioning
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:25:20
Okay. With Counterparty, only Counterparty is used when an asset is created. But for trading the asset, counterparty tokens are not necessary.
If you use counteparty's decentralized exchange, then either bitcoin or counterparty tokens can be used.
If you use a centralized exchange, this entity can offer a USD to Asset market, or any other combination, including bitcoin. Indeed, right now Poloniex offers a Monero to StorjX market. The users of that website do not know that StorjX is a counterparty asset in bitcoin's blockchain. 
The value of the token is based on what the market will demand. If Apple's counterparty share entitles the shareholder to get $50 dollars transferred from Apple to the current owner, then the market will value it accordingly.
For bitcoin, the value comes in where a big asset exchange, like Nasdaq, simply turns on the bitcoin : asset markets, alongside their USD ones. Exchanges for assets using bitcoin could facilitate scarcity in bitcoin. But established exchanges could just as easily never do that. What is the benefit? There can be benefits, but it could also just be ignored and the network will continue working fine.
Bitcoin can measure value based on its many other use cases. And right now it is based on the ignorance of its future growth potential. Many people don't know about Counterparty or Open Assets. This aspect works with bitcoin at a $30 exchange rate, it works at a $220 exchange rate. "But the money velocity" "but the confidence all these services bring", okay sure, bitcoin can rally from $2 to $30 again, after a selloff because other market participants already revised their growth propositions. But nothing about the all the trillions of securities and "smart contracts" inherently increases the scarcity of bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-06-11 14:44:40
Gotta be a way around that!
Maybe they could issue a colored coin asset (on all of the blockchains they serve) that gives owners the right but not the obligation to use their service. Their server could monitor the transfers of this asset and the transaction hashes could be registers in the ShapeShift server, and then users could reserve an amount of that cryptocurrency to transfer by moving that amount to that address, with a signature or additional hash for how much of a different cryptocurrency they want.
On ShapeShift's site the users could put in the transaction hashes (which Shapeshift would verify that the address the transaction hash references, has the appropriate amounts and colored coin asset)
Shapeshift could then prepare the amount of the second cryptocurrency in a multisig address with the user
ah shit now we are back to square one

Most of the core developers are involved in other alt coins and cryptocurrency technologies.
Most cryptocurrencies have superior features to bitcoin, whether it is block size, difficulty adjustment, block reward, metadata size....
At least three of core developers are involved with Monero which isn't even a fork of bitcoin and has advanced privacy features.
All of these devs also have input on bitcoin's blocksize debate.
And so do other cryptocurrency users, and exchanges which also cater to multiple cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.

I want to take a moment and ask what the hell that has to do with anything? Even people offering actual jobs want to look at this, seemingly implying it is a way to find a "good software engineer".
Having worked in software engineering *ALL* of my github repositories are private. *ALL* of my bitbucket repositories are private. *ALL* of my code contributions have been with companies that have trade secrets to protect, and contracts that provide them massive remedies if I disclosed anything. 
How is "show me your public github profile" a gauge of credibility at all?
Mine would be empty!
It would show some random repository I forked one day and basically zero commits.
I don't fork and create pull requests, I clone, change a line of code for my own use and move on!
What would your conclusion be? I am genuinely curious. To me it seems far removed from reality in every single aspect, but perhaps I just have one perspective:
"Hey guys look at all this time I have to give away coding techniques for free because I don't have any clients or a job or any situation where I am building something of actual value to anyone" I contribute to the open source effort by letting people know about issues with their code as I experience them, but github's social network won't reveal that to you

scarcity in bitcoin is the only thing that will increase the value of bitcoin. this thread is about scarcity created from protocols like colored coin, counterparty, omni and others.
if colored coin users only need to ever have enough bitcoin to cover a transaction fee, then 1000 colored coin users will in total have 1 bitcoin. 1,000,000 colored coin users will have in total 1000 bitcoins. 
There are not 1,000,000 colored coin users, not 1,000,000 bitcoin users at all currently. But in any case, it only takes 40 blocks to generate a new 1000 bitcoin, meaning that the supply of bitcoin is greater than the demand in this case. It isn't very relative, 80 blocks when the block reward is 12.5 bitcoin. This is amount is generated in 13.3 hours. Supply remains greater than the demand, expect to price to decrease with this particular use of bitcoin.
So even if there were MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS of colored coin users hoarding enough bitcoin to cover a transaction fee (only used when they transfer a colored coin asset to somebody else), the supply of bitcoin will still be greater, oversaturating the market with new bitcoin
Also, we have seen transaction fees get lowered when the exchange rate of bitcoin has risen fast, so I don't currently see a framework for this to have any material affect on scarcity, despite all of the "relative" variables.

At this point in time, I do not see any reason why anybody will pay more for one bitcoin, than the previous person. Since the network will work fine regardless of the exchange rate. Someone can come and manipulate the asset, by burning tons of bitcoin for whatever application, but we aren't seeing that.

True micropayments are not currently possible with bitcoin. They can be, but this decreases the demand way less than the block reward at least over the next 3 halvings! Seriously, run the numbers, scale it up! Auto selling miners alone will drive the price of bitcoin to the $50s before reaching equilibrium with some future massive economy of micropayers.
People want rich people to gobble up bitcoin like crazy but they don't need it because the financial system is already cheap enough for them, but then people want a system that caters to poor people but it doesn't do that well either. And then the working class already has bitcoin based remittance solutions so they don't need to touch it either, and then the middle class doesn't really care enough because they are comfortable enough with the inefficiencies.
The entire darknet can switch to open bazaar style e-commerce and the exchange rate won't nudge. The darknet itself has grown 3x the size of silk road 1.0 while the exchange rate was dropping month after month, year and after... well till now. I too can dream about the day when people don't need to cash out of bitcoin, but I don't see that in this analysis. 
Speculation is based on future value, and in none of our use cases is there ANY UTILITY AT ALL to pay for bitcoin itself at a higher price than the next person. Machine-to-machine special micropayments? Because there are other ways to do it on bitcoin's network that doesn't involve using bitcoin at all. If there is a miners fee, that simply goes back to the miners which is net zero issuance.

Giving them priority to their inventions in 2013-2014, just as the rest of the industry independently came up with some of the ideas a little later, making it a very lucrative bet for the patent filer.

Iceland's banks were too big NOT to fail.
The financial sector was 1000% the GDP of Iceland.
In comparison, the US banking sector is only 8% of US GDP. For the situation to be analogous, the US financial sector would have to be worth 155 trillion USD. That means assets with a clear worth, not paper derivatives and debt swaps!
The US can afford to continue to prop up its capital markets over and over and over and over again with US taxpaper's residual income/taxes. And if the sector actually gets too big then the US can then consider expropriating all that dozens of trillions in private wealth stored here in houses, land, whatever! But bailins would come before that, JP Morgan has like 5 trillion in assets under management, haircuts would come from there first!
Many places really just don't have this option! The dictator has all the wealth and/or the GDP really isn't that great. Iceland literally only has 330,000 people to tax. Thats a couple of insignificant suburban towns here in the US. "oh they arrested the bankers, how novel!" its more like a small town getting mad and some unknown district attorney arresting the suspects except with the twist being that there is simply no higher government to appeal to. You fucked something up and the judge hates your guts? Thats it, the end!
As tempting as it is to hate on the US you just have to remember, there is nothing that will actually balance the budget no matter what tax concoction anyone makes up, the US has resources to do whatever the hell it wants with its finances, and no other place on the planet has this kind of private wealth and resources to finance itself. Its aggravating to think about when you are a taxpayer here, but in my international dealings I've realized this. You have governments around the world that have these cool looking laws on paper, but there is literally nobody over there doing anything, there is no process, the regulator's car has been broken for 3 months and can't get to the agency to put a stamp on the document you fedex'd.

Private blockchains have "opt-in transparency", public blockchains have "opt-in privacy". 
Bitcoin is a public blockchain.
Monero is a private blockchain.
Every transaction and address in Monero is a stealth address. That is relevant here because Darkwallet also uses stealth addresses on Bitcoin's network, but unfortunately bitcoin's public blockchain creates weak links, whereas Monero's private blockchain has no weak links this way.
Monero further obfuscates transactions using ring signatures in every transaction. Nobody casually looking at a blockchain transaction knows the to-and-from address, similarly a casual observer doesn't know the addresses used at all because these aren't published in the transaction or in the blockchain.

Your idea of how to "make money" from bitcoin is very limited. 
Did some people make over $500,000 from buying/mining bitcoin and selling later? Yep, plenty. Many cashed out too! How much capital did they start off with.. $1000? $2,000,000? Stop thinking in the peon mindsight.
Next up, John the Dog probably made close to $120,000 in BTC by providing the most trustworthy escrow service before multisig.
I made the most of my profits by investing in ASICMiner, a company in Ghangzhou that raised capital in bitcoin, and issued dividends in bitcoin. And some other quick and awesome trades in cryptoequities. I miss those days before the SEC shut down the stock exchanges!
JustDice experienced a 50% return on investment for all it's shareholders, who could only invest in bitcoin. If your position was $1,000,000 then you did realize $500,000 in gains.

DarkWallet is interesting
but there are also several fatal flaws to privacy
1) Obelisks know too much, although in theory you can run your OWN obelisk and transaction info from that through TOR
2) You never know the liquidity of the mixer. If there are no (or not enough) coins to mix with then it will send your transaction out directly. Even with stealth it will link back to you in clear. This can be solved with dedicated participants (like market makers) always sending stuff through it. An interesting idea but I'd like them to be anonymous too, tricky to raise funds for that.
3) If you DID know the liquidity, this too would give too much information. As you could correlate this to individuals making transactions
If you just read whitepapers you will never learn the problems of the technologies the creators are heralding. Just stick with private blockchains (and learn the pros and cons of them too, like why you shouldn't use the "mixin = 0, 1 or 2" parameter.)

St. Kitts and Nevis has a citizenship by investment program that has been around for 30 years. Roger Ver is just acting as a broker, letting people navigate the foreign legal speedbumps easily.
Although I believe Roger Ver dropped his US citizenship in exchange for St. Kitts and Nevis, there would otherwise still be no prohibition for selling a foreign country's citizenship programs to other people.
The US, for example, also has a citizenship by investment program that is not much more expensive but for first world countries it is common to have requirements like "create 10 jobs", which makes it more impractical

I have a much deeper understanding of SEC settlement negotiations than would allow me to agree with that.
The SEC doesn't want to go to court over their unconstitutional regulations, the entire New Deal was torn apart by the courts with the SEC being one of the only leftovers. Coming up with a SEC payoff figure is very informal, its like haggling at a pawn shop except with SEC enforcers on the other side.

could also be read as "security" under the SEC's authorizing statute as a profit sharing agreement or contract (distributed, and enforced by software)
and if the executive branch moves to slow, it WILL be considered a currency by the courts, as both state courts and federal courts have already established
so we'll have it treated as a commodity, a security, and a currency. GREAT, except we'll need the legislative branch to create the separate asset class to account for the unique properties it really has.

Coinprism has its own arbitrary metrics of proof, and their website has its own arbitrary ways of displaying it. SSL certificates are an arbitrary centralized means of verification that Coinprism made up and has nothing to do with colored coins or the open assets protocol.
The transaction in the BLOCKCHAIN itself contains a link to t0.com 's metadata JSON file.
If you were using a decentralized exchange to buy some, you would have to ask the issuer, and if you were using a centralized exhcnage to buy some, you would have to trust the exchange. And if you wanted to monitor the blockchain you would have to ask the owner what a relevant address was.
Coinprism and their user interface has absolutely nothing to do with that.

for example a 2-of-3 multisignature address would be controlled by:
a) YOU, BENEFICIARY 1, BENEFICIARY 2
No funds can be moved *from* this address without 
YOU and BENEFICIARY 1, or YOU and BENEFICIARY 2, or BENEFICIARY 1 and BENEFICIARY 2
those two would have to co-conspire
b) YOU, LAWYER, BENEFICIARY
It is literally impossible for the lawyer to embezzle now
c) YOU, ESCROW AGENT, BENEFICIARY
d) YOU, LAWYER, LAYWER
you can have other combinations in a multisignature address, but the idea is that funds cannot be sweeped from the address, so other people could be aware of the private key (I think) but would not be able to withdraw from it "accidentally"

The main criticism of the european social advances of free healthcare and free higher education is that it is expensive and its improbable that they could do it if they were also paying for their country’s defense. NATO defends Europe and is disproportionately paid for by US taxpayers in both dollars and percent while the US suffers and splits its own country about its budget and extremely high healthcare and education costs.
This evokes emotions in a lot of people so lets arbitrarily switch the countries up: “hey Brazil, you down to pay for another continent’s defense? Wow holy shit you guys have serious crime and infrastructure issues but good thing those are just local government issues, instead of getting caught up on stuff inside your own country - how insensitive would that be right - keep defending us from Russia for us”
Now Europe is considering its own 27 nation military force, which may still adequately reduce the cost burden away from any single country and they may be able to pull it off!

many united states are adequate low-to-no overhead jurisdictions for this
an LLC will act as a pass-through entity to the federal government meaning that you don't have to do any tax forms for that LLC, you just pay tax on your personal income from the LLC indistinct from your other income sources
this LLC will be able to open accounts with third parties where necessary
it can be in any US state or territory, over 50 to choose from. 
I like Wyoming's regulations:
no income tax, can be formed "anonymously" for public record purposes - but you'll need a lawyer to do the filing for max anonymity (like in any state) in the private record side with the registered agent and stuff

Although I'm not the target demographic for this discussion, I've received payments for writing gigs in bitcoin, amongst other things. It worked in my mind, it worked in the counterparty's mind, and it also worked in the real world as we completed the transaction.
Its also something that someone in middle school could do.
Bitcoin thrives on whatever people want to transact for. 
"There is not a single legal use case bitcoin is good at or cheaper than other centralized alternatives." so are you waiting for me to convince you otherwise with new information that will give you an "aha" moment, or are you just waiting to dismiss the source to confirm your existing opinion?

Some businesses are reporting getting heinous extortion letters from a mysterious source (as pictured), unless they pay the ransom with bitcoin. Its kind of ridiculous, unverifiable and scary.
This makes light of the situation by imagining that Mt. Gox a failed exchange under bankruptcy protection has to come up with a way to pay its creditors, by being the surprise source of the exortion letters.
Mark Karpeles of Mt. Gox has "found" massive numbers of "missing" bitcoin before. So this just plays with the collective conscious of several situations.

so I use bitcoin on a daily basis to pay my suppliers and buy goods and services, these are for 99% intangible goods like domain names, skype credits, software development, international business
now, for the 'average wage slave in America', like Joe, if thats what you meant, these things are not relevant. 
I have great banking relationships, but they fail to adequately supply me with quick value transfer between peers, or my own accounts, or my brokers etc.
But Joe has a checking account, maybe, and it works, and that's all Joe needs to know, as he attempts to avoid overdraft fees, occasionally make it to the bank during the bank's business hours without getting fired from his job, and continuing rationalizing his existence.
Aside from bitcoin's utility, most of us are here because we know that bitcoin technology CAN work for Joe, just like the checking account can work for Joe. Joe doesn't know about the hundreds of separate regulations that make his checking account work, or the 7 federal and 3 state agencies required to make it work, or the 100's of humans making sure it continues working, and in the future we don't expect Joe to know that his checking account is backed by bitcoin when all of a sudden his bank stays open on federal holidays, the 3 state agencies are abolished, and the 7 federal agencies become redundant political pawns during the next election's budget debates.
Bitcoin isn't just a financial tool, but the financial aspect, the currency, was created alongside of bitcoin technology, to be the incentive that proliferates the rest of the technology, and they are intertwined. This is a much longer discussion, anyway, for us gamblers the point is that bitcoin units are a finite resource and each unit will be a lot more valuable as it becomes more usable to more people.
Regarding how its price goes up and down, bitcoin was created to be used as a currency and is used as a currency. Bitcoin has properties of currencies, stocks (equities), commodities and these are purely semantical distinctions. Bitcoin is a new asset class, just like cars were a new transportation class but the word "car" didn't come around till 40 years after "like a horseless carriage but" was repeated ad nauseum in discussion.
@_date: 2014-11-05 13:56:07
I have a very similar risk profile as you.
The only difference is that I also spend a substantial amount of bitcoin, while accumulating more.
If you aren't borrowing to add to your bitcoin position, are financially stable and can maintain your lifestyle, then what you are doing is not reckless.
disclosure: I have a higher percent of my net worth in bitcoin. I would also be able to walk away if bitcoin failed or I lost my coins. Again, simply delay a downpayment on a house or something. I consider different asset classes to be riskier than bitcoin.

Although I do not care about merchant adoption nor find it a priority for the benefits I see in this technology, given how eclipsed all that will be by capital markets settled in bitcoin.

Zerocash is not a successor to Zerocoin, it is simply different, and share similarities in the name alone.
Zerocoin is being implemented by Gnosis in Anoncoin, and is on track to go live within a month. The supposed problems with Zerocoin have all been fixed by Gnosis, as the zero knowledge proofs are now much smaller and can be deleted after X confirmations (instead of taking up space forever).

So an actual unit of account "corporate-coin" is possible, where each member has their own reserves of the system and actually settles debts between each other with them
there is no actual unit of account, and the decentralized ledger is just being used to show that something happened, for instance, metadata stored in the OP_RETURN section of a transaction has nothing to do with there being any value transferred. And it isn't a technological feat to be able to write to new blocks without sending an "amount"
The actual debts can be settled later or using the legacy system, much like how hawaladars work. But there would be no room for hiding that a debt wasn't settled because there would still be a finite amount that the system would be accounting for. so if one member didn't actually settle their debt, everyone would know that there is an imbalance of assets within the whole system
the perk being that they don't have to trust each other or a third party (accountant?) to say that one member was being honest, they can all tell if they are being honest all the time

see thats the thing, Long Term Capital Management is the best example of why bitcoin isn't even a high risk investment.
I'm an options trader, LTCM was trading options. Here's the kicker, for all the finance 101 guys that regurgitate these case studies like a preschooler sings the alphabet song, LTCM was the guys that CREATED the black scholes method for valuing options, and then they SOLD THESE INFLATED IMPROPERLY VALUED options to everyone, and then the market reversed on them and they were subject to unlimited losses, and they're silly valuation model bankrupted them.
The black scholes formula is still the predominate method of valuing options. I like irony.
For someone long bitcoin as an asset, there is no way to experience unlimited losses. Unlimited losses are a unique property of being short an asset or being short that asset's derivatives.
Bitcoin is not even in the same class of risk for people like us that know what's out there. I plan to go long bitcoin options when they become more liquid and more available.
There are no absolutes, using 1.5x leverage on some shitty bitcoin exchange allows for a 75% decline in asset price to obliterate the initial capital. that's an extreme for bitcoin and that and greater price declines have happened 3 times in its existence, but a benign occurrence on a daily basis. Using 50x leverage on bitcoin is more ridiculous.
But again, long term capital management was SHORT DERIVATIVES so its not even a comparison. Some inception type shit subject to five orders of magnitude more price fluctuations than the underlying asset.

Hello, yes your observation is correct that merchant adoption is a silly benchmark of proliferation that only people most excluded from the capital markets could have come up with.
Crypto-funded startups do raise capital very quickly and so far 2013 had the biggest boom and bust of that already. There were hot IPOs all around the world that anyone could participate in, including remote places for raising capital such as beijing.
Darkcoin , curecoin, gridcoin, all blockchain technologies that can proliferate very quickly, despite the dubious rationalizations of their exchange rate.

we could make it expensive

I think you are getting too caught up on playing devil's advocate or diving down one possible scenario
There are other cryptocurrencies which use many MANY variables easily calculated from their respective networks to make dynamic adjustments to their issuance schemes or other things
There is a lot to be learned from them, the way Darkcoin pays masternodes is based nearly 10 variables, Nautilus tries to maintain an issuance stream based on economic activity within its system (I own none of these coins)
the blockchain research done in these other chains have been to have real world case studies instead of hyperbole about what might happen in a bitcoin hardfork

Understandable, alternative blockchains exist because they do things the core developers won't approve. They are test beds. Unlike other most altcoins, Monero - a working anonymous blockchain - doesn't use bitcoin-core at all. The bitcoin code base has potential for improving that allows for these other technologies to work on bitcoin's blockchain, for those that want to be anonymous, without changing how bitcoin the unit functions at all. But at the moment this doesn't exist, and these alternatives fulfill a niche in the only way available - by releasing a separate blockchain.
I think that privacy is a major concern and people don't really realize how upcoming features like HD wallets BIP32, BIP39, and BIP 44 all undermine privacy practices if a user isn't aware of what they do
Its unfortunate that since these things aren't really out yet (only a couple android wallets support them), that it puts tutorials in a state of flux since there is nothing to relate to nor are there even established solutions to the problems they'll present

I gathered from this one is that it stores a cache of blocks, basically X amount of recent blocks and then Y amount of recently requested blocks. This way, all auto-pruning nodes have different blocks on them, instead of the whole network having pruned blocks.
Pretty awesome, I could imagine that the code could periodically monitor the availability of missing blocks and ensure that you have a copy if availability is low. Information remains infallible because all blocks still retain a known hash, and changing any transaction data in the block would change the hash.
Speaking of hashes, this could tie in perfectly with block header first syncing, instead of needing to even download the whole blocks sequentially to begin with. You could have a blockchain of headers, this would be incredibly small, and have only full blocks that are needed, in accordance with the autopruning logic.
I had been brainstorming a viable blockchain pruning solution for a long time, but just seeing that 288 blocks would be retained at a time, gave me the spark of cognition I needed.

this is an exercise in resilience in the infrastructure. every single 1000% rally ended with Mt. Gox crashing the entire bitcoin market, the rally from $110 to $1100 was no different than the rally from $~30 to $266 was no different than the rally to $34 in 2011
Bitcoin price also stayed in the doldrums for **all** of 2012, after a **90%** fall from highs. So if 50% or even 70% price decline is even significant to you, then you are in the wrong market.
What we are building is a market that can handle a rally without a single point of failure crashing the entire thing.
So yes, maybe I will wake you up in a rally.

The US government relies on voluntary compliance for tax reporting
The US government has tools to enforce noncompliance
The US government will still rely on voluntary compliance for tax reporting in bitcoin
The US government does not currently have tools to enforce noncompliance if bitcoin best practices were used, and it is not expected that they will ever have effective tools
but the rules themselves don't change.
Self employed individuals and contractors already have more discretion with reporting their earnings, than an employee. So although you might not be able to relate to having discretion at hiding your funds from the IRS, it is currently the reality as is.
Several countries are noticing that bitcoin is more of a financial service, than an asset, exempting it from taxation, because the network is really just facilitating the transactions of inputs and outputs, and it is mere coincidence that there is market value in controlling an input.

did you just extrapolate a linear ratio... nevermind
you don't understand the mining algorithm at all to say that. literally two people mining next to each other could power the entire bitcoin network no matter how many transactions there were or what the exchange rate was.
those two people can compete with each other if they wanted, with more powerful and efficient hardware to lower their electric costs while getting more bitcoin than the next.
emphasis on EFFICIENT. 
computational processes will get more powerful while using less energy.
for mining, different people will have different profit margins at different times, as well as different motives
there is no technical reason for bitcoin's power use to scale in a linear ratio, nor is there an economic reason.

this I don't disagree with, but a more likely decentralized hedging vehicle will be less further away from the underlying asset
the derivative is an XCP asset tradable with bitcoin based on a net asset value. Market maker keeps thin bitcoin denominated spreads that change based on the computed value of bitcoin/usd or whatever needs to be hedged against.
This will allow btc holder to go directly into a trade with that fund/asset with their btc, instead buying XCP, and then buying BitshareXCP and then buying BitshareXCPHedgingAsset or however deep you need to go

Are you still around? I wanted to add to this but last week Reddit went down
You are treating bitcoin like shares of a penny stock that you "Should be able to buy like you can buy shares of Apple"
The truth is, it didn't take you 5 minutes to open your bank account with chase, it actually took time out of your day to go and see them, or talk on the phone, or fill out a bunch of things online, and it took a while to get it funded.
Then Chase one day, due to relaxed regulations, said hey, why not open a brokerage account online and have it linked straight to your bank account in the same online login.
Then you did that and moved money over there and waited several business days for the cash to settle in your money market sweep account and then you bought shares of Apple during a limited 8 hour window on business days only.
Bitcoin replaces the bank, and there is an equivalent - IF NOT LESS - amount of friction for getting integrated into the bitcoin system, than there is getting integrated with a bank. So even though you are treating bitcoin like an investment that you want to park in your brokerage account, you are missing the point of what bitcoin is and why there is an expectation of future demand for it. Bitcoin replaces the bank, it replaces the brokerage firm, it also functions as a currency.
And yes, a lot of us are making it even easier to use and acquire for everyone, including the millions of unbanked people and the millions of people not deemed eligible for the banking conveniences we take for granted

I think it is rationally priced at the time being. There are possibilities of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin coming back into the market, pending court cases and asset forfeitures.
Thats between Silk Road and Mt. Gox.
The bearwhale incident a few weeks ago was caused by a 9 million dollar sell order, for reference. The mere appearance of the order dropped bitcoin/usd price by 20%. Given an order 10x in size, of which will happen if a trustee liquidates or the government hosts another auction or a case is dropped and dread pirate roberts gets his btc returned, then one could imagine bitcoin dropping in price... basically 99%

thats how averages work, there would still be a limit for each individual block, and there could still be a much higher maximum limit, or the average takes into account many more blocks making the average move slower

because you have no idea what you are talking about
the SEC is routinely involved in extrajudicial enforcement actions. Do you know what extrajudicial means? It means operating outside of their host country. Read and learn so you can tuck away your juvenile idealistic understanding of what "jurisdiction" actually means.
The Silk Road bust involved the DOJ seizing servers from another country, where it can be assumed that no other country was even looking into it. I really think you don't understand the scope of possibilities and the lack of consequences for extrajudicial actions of the United States.

a "fractured" blockchain won't affect affect wealth that is stored in bitcoin. It will affect new transactions if consensus about the right chain cant be determined
Satellites running full nodes will happen. This mitigates a lot of concerns about bitcoin's reliance on internet.
Bitcoin transactions can be signed offline (meaing they can be prepared to be sent, you can send), and of course you can receive bitcoin while offline as someone else will have the correct blockchain and will broadcast to it.  For sending you just eventually need to broadcast a transaction, so it is reasonable that some internet cafe or someone with specialized hardware to connect to an orbiting satellite full node will be a hub where people broadcast transactions, just like Western Unions are hubs for people to broadcast remittances.

IRS? ok American. the tax burden being obvious
okay so client is in the UK and you need client to pay you without there being a paper trail. 
therefore you set a bank account in Austria? how would you do that? FATCA will still have them report that you are an American, and even without FATCA, Austria's bank secrecy laws do not effectively apply to foreigners anymore, so even if you're thinking "Well its just 30k now" in 2 years that 30k becomes known to the IRS , or sometime in the next 10 years the IRS runs their script through the EU database and finds your unpaid taxes
bad idea. 30k in a foreign financial institution also subjects you to the Treasury annual report of foreign bank accounts, which has big penalties for non compliance when they find out
so if your goal is to not have a paper trail, to support your upcoming voluntary decision to avoid tax compliance, then you need to unlink transactions.
none of this banking account bullshit is going to help you. banks and property in other countries have great perks, but the secrecy perk does not apply to americans. outside of the IRS, the a perk is that creditors cannot realistically access those properties even if a lawyer/district judge knew about those assets and you got held in contempt for not releasing them. but you shouldn't consider the IRS one of those creditors.
so regardless of the motivation, you simple need to unlink transactions. This can be done with bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. it is a more efficient way to pay between international clients whether you are whitewashing or not. you still need to understand the limitations of this, governments and banking institutions can and do track bitcoin transactions.
regardless, it sounds like your clients need to warm up to bitcoin
your clients think bitcoin is sketchy when you are the one trying to do something sketchy with it. self fulfilling prophecy? maybe your root problem is how you view this technology, thats seriously the first thing you thought of "oh hey this possibly makes my tax noncompliance possible! I've been waiting for years for this piece of the puzzle" instead of "oh hey the state isn't even involved in bitcoin transactions, I can see the utility here, voluntary tax compliance actually is voluntary now"

Think about it using your knowledge of how laws are created
Is it a creature of the legislature for a hotel to require id, hm thats an odd law what are the consequences for that law, how is that law enforced, how are they drawing a distinction between hotel and anyone else providing similar service for enforcement of that law?
Alright then, maybe there is a regulator with wide discretion, perhaps a license or a tax that is applied to hotels that comes with arbitrary requirements for compliance.. okay plausible
Perhaps it is an insurance company that requires ID of guests to mitigate liability
Maybe this is just a company policy, an interpretation of what the company needs to do (because other hotels are doing it) that isn't based on any case study, case law, legislative law or anything (much like institutions that require faxes and checks and notaries for things that are 'more serious')
Anyway, the point being that just because something is commonplace doesn't mean it has any rhyme or reason with a law

so I'm fine with that. This price and lower, are rational prices for bitcoin at this point in time, for reasons I've mentioned throughout this thread.
Every single bubble in bitcoin history has ended with Mt. Gox tanking the bitcoin market by 70-90%
and I have successfully traded based on that reality. Every bubble. ALL. It is literally called getting goxxed. 
I sold most of my position at the top and bought back in after a 70% retracement. This wasn't technical analysis voodoo, it was based on how bitcoins are moved to exchanges, I think I got filled after some weird china news. 
so that was around $340 and bitcoin rose well over $600 again after that this year, a nearly 100% gain from lows.

How to stump a regulator 101:
1) Ask them how much does terrorist financing actually costs? How much do acts of terrorism actually cost, ie. 2004 Madrid Bombings, 9/11
2) Since the answer is an insanely low number, ask them if any capital controls or reporting requirements would flag any of those amount used to finance terrorists
"uh well, I suppose not, I'm not too familiar with the article or study in question so I can't specifically comment on those exact incidents"
3) Come full circle and ask who anti-money laundering legislation actually effects if it doesn't affect terrorists, narcotraffickers, and by some stretch of the imagination: pedophiles
4) Throw in a little conjecture, "Since an international wire transfer of $10,000+ to a Suntrust bank in Florida wouldn't be flagged in 2001 or now and HSBC laundered $7,000,000,000 in that same time period, then there is enough cleaned terrorist financing in the financial system for 147 9/11's every day for the next thirteen years... does it really make cognitive sense to stand by the current approach to the crime of money laundering"

liquidity is how fast and how much you can buy and sell something at the stated price. with bitcoin this is possible within seconds.
the 99% refers to the 99% of the population which is not so wealthy. the 1% have over 1/4th of all the wealth, or a similarly large disproportionate amount than the 99% combined.
Bitcoin is not liquid enough for the 1%, as buying and selling merely several million dollars worth of bitcoin will move the market greatly.

the transaction fees are intended to become greater than the block reward, in the presence of more transactions
right now, each block contains about .25 BTC in transaction fees alone. So assume that increases, assume block reward decreases, assume exchange rate increases
So there will be an inflection point, way before all bitcoins are mined.
But for sake of illustration, when the block reward is 1 btc in the year 2100, and 1 btc is worth $500,000 and the transaction fees in that block equal 3 btc (and this would be a VERY pessimistic outlook)
you can see how the incentive continues forever
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:33:40
yes, only that one regulator in new york had said anything condemning non-public blockchains. Given the information he had at the time, I can understand what he meant, but I think he meant that to apply to cryptonote things, although there was no example of it aside from the cryptonote research paper which nobody had any reason to look at.
With Monero and cryptonote currencies, although the blockchain is public, you just can't link anything by looking at it. Even if a receiving address was under control by subpoena, it wouldn't reveal the sender's information.
Everyone at the senator hearings, such as Fincen and DoJ's comments that bitcoin is more transparent than other financial transactions, seemed to assume that block chain technologies would retain their linkability.

yes you have to think carefully, but your  isn't the end of the story
if you have NO OTHER CAPITAL GAINS that year, then you can deduct $3000 in capital losses. And the next year, IF YOU HAVE NO OTHER CAPITAL GAINS then you can deduct another bit of your large loss.
but any year, now and within the next seven years, when you do have a capital gain for the year, then you can deduct the total amount of your old capital loss away from that gain. That year you will have lots of gains and little to no tax. Its pretty great.
so lets say you are a shit investor in general and you had a loss in 2012 for something, lost a bunch of money. But then you actually made a gain in 2013 in bitcoin (and sold), then you could deduct that entire 2012 loss off of your 2013 gain and be rolling in the dough without worrying about the tax bill.

I don't inherently disagree with you, but moving to altcoins with faster confirmations times and entirely different protocols is really not cumbersome. For "mixing" or unlinking transactions, this can be automated on decentralized exchanges and would still be faster than bitcoin mixing.
Regarding Monero, it has utility for people that want to, have been trying to, and need to unlink their transactions, right now. Coincidentally it also is a viable peer 2 peer digital cash system that maintains privacy of its users. No more pseudonymous, we're done with that. Cryptonote protocol has interesting applications, compared to bitcoin and bitcoin-forks, cryptonote is simply different. I can't dismiss it as an inflation causing blight to bitcoin.

Okay great, so how about the stocks I bought *WITH* bitcoin. 
In all of your examples you assume I bought X number of bitcoin and realized gains on X
But now lets play the game where I bought X number of bitcoin, I now have Y, where Y is  maybe &gt; X, but could be &lt; X, I don't even remember.
and some of that these bitcoin were from earnings which acted like dividends on unregulated securities issued by people in countries all around the world. and most of it was from day trading the bitcoin or litecoin denominated stocks.
I'm not a tax protester at all, but this part makes no sense. And all the exchanges I traded on have shut down. And multiple cryptocurrencies are involved. And some are still locked up in stocks that are not trading but issuing dividends.

All bitcoin-core coins, including bitcoin itself, suffer from this. Another poster already mentioned Mike Hearn's research into "merge avoidance"
so that is good to see. A lot of bitcoin wallets are implementing BIPs without a real discussion into how this alters and undermines individual's financial privacy, so I want to address that and get a real discussion going on about that.
Now, Monero XMR. You presuppose that I think it is superior, I think it has potential and there are some key limitations to it that developers are trying to address, emphasis on trying.
What I like: 
- Unlinkable transactions in a blockchain.
- Can be used to unlink transactions from all other blockchains
- **Sender and Receiver do not know each other's addresses**
- Ring signatures are essentially trustless, decentralized mixing
- **is anonymous with no extra thought for the end user**
- can be even more anonymous with extra thought for the end user (or presets in the software, specifically the degree of mixins when forming each transaction)
- **can't read balances of individual addresses, in the blockchain**
What I don't like:
- lack of good wallet software (no GUI)
- difficult to install, no guarantees that your system doesn't need some extra dependencies that may not work
- blockchain size
- blockchain size in the future (scalability issues)
- colored coins and smart contracts may not be possible on the main chain (due to aforementioned inability to see contents of an address)

I would like to point out that there is no burden on the consumer to even know if a distributor has a license to copyrighted content or any claim on the content whatsoever.
We assume Netflix secured the rights, we assume all the discs at Walmart are sanctioned by their respective copyright holders. And we assume that everything at ThePirateBay is seeded illegally, unless a musician publicly stated on the front page of reddit that they are so cool for putting their album in a torrent. The reality is that all of this could be false "yeah but cmon 99% of --" and there is no consequence on the consumer for using the most convenient option.

ah, you could send them to a mixer
you could exchange them for a different digital currency on any existing exchange (and then back on a different exchange, if you wanted). The result is that anyone chasing you through the blockchain will not be able to distinguish the next bitcoin address from simply changing addresses you control or for an exchange for litecoins.
similarly in about a month's time, the decentralized exchanges will exist, in which case no website will be facilitating the exchanges, if you think existing exchanges require id or record IP addresses for authorities and TOR is too cumbersome

Sure there are plenty of advantages, but for every day purchases this month in 2014 bitcoin does not solve a use case for the average American.
Bitcoin functions better than the dollar and other asset classes, so the ideal is that you acquire bitcoins and spend those bitcoins, not ever touching the dollar financial system. There is no "conversion fee" in this scenario. 
The latest US tax treatment isn't favorable, but there are ways to acquire and spend bitcoin without having to worry about the price fluctuations

They live in a parallel socialist regime of NYC called NYCHA. It is public housing run by the city corporation. Note to Americans: Socialist is not being used in the pejorative here. But yes, tenants of NYCHA get heavily subsidized housing paid through taxation of others. Unfortunately, it is not easy (read: realistic) to make the gap from NYCHA to a productive member of society that can afford actual rent.

No no no, go back to your original post. The business voluntarily created this address with the IRS, and it is a stealth address. The IRS already can watch that address. The IRS doesn't need to know that address is with a particular business. The IRS doesn't need to know that 50 of the other 5 million multisig stealth addresses it is part of belong to the same business. Until it inspects other metadata on those addresses (or separate databases) that are required for any kind of accounting or auditing.
With a stealth address, the business has privacy from blockchain analysis and privacy from the people that paid this business.
If the IRS didn't get additional metadata in the creation of this address (via API, or other) then the IRS wouldn't be able to audit this business.
Similarly, nothing about your original supposition or your concerns have anything to do with stopping a business from creating a different address. Have you ever used bitcoin wallets? The reason I ask is because it sounds like you are more familiar with theory than reality and are conflating outcomes. 
The reason why this isn't a concern is because not every kind of transaction is a taxable event. 
A business would be EXPECTED to receive INCOME to a particular set of addresses, and those would be multisig addresses with the IRS, for the IRS to watch. **ALL THIS ENABLES** is for the IRS to help extrapolate wha their earnings will be in a time period, given clear transparent real time data. This doesn't help the IRS enforcement regime whatsoever, so lets make that clear.
A business would NEED other addresses for financing between subsidiaries, capital from shareholders, their bond issuance, their dividend payments to shareholders, payments to employees, amongst 100 other things. These things all have nothing to do with the IRS and neither the inputs and outputs of these addresses would be tax events.

Reintegration of converted funds is stupid easy with cryptocurrency. This is the third and final step of money laundering, in case you have never taken an MBA, read an OECD manual, or watched a five minute youtube video on the concept.
For property, people typically can rent from an offshore corporation which owns property (and the corporation doesn't have their name on it, nor owns a bank account)
For income, people can become life coaches, and report any number of clients paying any number of large sums. (where one or all of the clients is fake and paying the life coach $2000 a month, each, for pickup artist techniques)
These two examples were before cryptocurrency, and the offshore corporation has only been made complicated in recent times due to the need of a bank account. This is no longer applicable.
Finally, what I wrote (and you quoted) is emphasizing **effective** tools. The IRS audits 1-2% of people they believe have tax obligations. This is already expensive for the IRS and their regime gets more aggressive pursuing international cooperation the more and more debt its government incurs. With bitcoin, where there are no banks to request the cooperation of (if best practices were used, off exchange, mixing), it will be prohibitively expensive for them to continue (even if they prove the funds are in a particular address, it will become infinitely expensive for them to still collect that address, again, if best practices were used), and it will be more likely that Congress (or by proxy, the people) will evaluate it's budget and tax collection efforts, long before it overspends itself. It will be the foreign creditors of the US Treasury that will lose faith in the IRS' ability to collect taxes (assuming widespread noncompliance, or if the IRS fails to get its $1 trillion in income taxes one year for some reason)

you can buy bitcoin with your 401k

or you can make your own solo roth 401k and use post tax dollars to buy bitcoin
you just have to make damn sure that you don't touch those bitcoin for the next several decades, or else you will incur massive tax penalties

You trust (via probability, or via the sustained obscurity of the technology, or by trust of the operator you connect to) that DarkWallet servers are not keeping records of transactions. you trust that the obelisk server running darkwallet hasn't been compromised for years (like silk road was). You trust that it helps you unlink transactions, when it ultimately cannot be trusted to do that.
This is the inherent flaw of any and every coinjoin solution. Whether its blockchain.info's, darkwallet, or masternodes in the darkcoin network, no matter how many servers there are. decentralized does not equal trustless, and it is only marginally better than a mixer like bitcoinfog.
I too would be interested in a different 'opinion', one that goes into detail about how the stealth addresses help this issue. But I've read enough research paper into stealth addresses to understand how it falls apart in a network with non-stealthed addresses.
There are cryptocurrencies where all addresses are stealthed. Dark Wallet is not a great solution for bitcoin's network, and it is not a needed solution for cryptocurrencies or any user of a blockchain's desire to unlink a transaction.

Vendors are selling bitcoin for fiat in larger and larger amounts of bitpay continues their manifest destiny across ecommerce.
A large portion of bitcoin are held by the goverment and trustees and could be released onto the open market at any time. more than 10x more than came available in the bearwhale incident.
This can potentially drop the price very far from this point, and the market continues pricing this in, along with the daily stream of new bitcoin generated and sold for fiat.
There has been nothing concrete, infrastructure wise, to support a large influx of new funds going into bitcoin from fiat. So it is expected for the price to continue declining at the same rate.
The ETFs from SecondMarket or the Winklevii are things to look forward to but they are not available yet.

No Coinjoin or mixing solution is great. Therefore it doesn't matter how many times you do this.
Ring signatures coupled with stealth addresses work better. Here is an example transaction:
Here the transaction in the blockchain shows that there were 41 input addresses and 76 output addresses
In reality, the sender had one address and the receiver had one address.
But you can't tell which key is either of their's. Neither the sender or receiver knew this either.
People use Monero as a financial service to avoid gambling prohibitions from bitcoin sites to exchanges. (buy bitcoin, gamble with bitcoin, try to sell bitcoin but the seller - Coinbase, for instance - will not accept them due to association with a known gambling address). People are mixing with Monero because the confirmations are faster and the blockchain is opaque: nobody knows anything.
Information about Monero gets downvoted not because it is false, but because it is not about bitcoin.
The reality is that many people want the benefits of ANY cryptocurrency without leaking their financial information or trade secrets.

let me reveal three presuppositions that will lead to your embarrassment 
1) you presuppose that the argument is dollar cost averaging over time versus opening one large position at the initial point in time. For people that earn money at an interval, capital is not available for the latter idea.
2) you presuppose that the person has a finite amount they are willing to lose, that never changes. Lets say after dollar cost averaging a position size has grown to $50,000 and they aren't willing to buy more ... even if that person had $50,000 to invest say six months ago, that person wouldn't have necessarily been interested in opening a position of $50,000
3) You presuppose that someone (dipshits like me) is dollar cost averaging as price rises, only. Dollar cost averaging can lower your cost basis, which is what myself and the OP are talking about.

yeah we all get it.
Bitcoin can be used to represent stocks and equities without middle men. 
A single US equity like twitter has a market cap 4 times bitcoin's market.
bitcoin's market cap (and price) would have to be at least 4 times more to represent the shares and trading of a single US equity.
There are thousands of US equities.
There are millions of derivatives representing those US equities.

Unfortunately, I've pondered that their security regulations could apply to any distributed autonomous contract. Although enforcing that would be wild and so obviously misguided.
Cryptocurrencies desperately need legislative exemptions to both the 'property' designation for tax purposes as well as securities exemptions to help their economy grow.
In this case though, the SEC, as well as the Director of National Intelligence (what? I know) actually has authority to exempt securities from the act at their own discretion for limited times. Also, there are legislative exemptions to certain kinds of securities (such as contracts lasting less than 9 months and not expected to be renewed) in the Securities Act of 1933.
Either way, the government (its agencies and legislative bodies) can do practically anything at this point to promote or limit the growth/practicality of cryptocurrencies in the near term.
I'm glad the SEC actions let us have this conversation though, there has been a current of "government can't touch this rah rah" in bitcoin for the past 5 years, really stifling discussion of the inevitable regulatory response and compliance steps

For the merchant, depends on the arbitrary licensing requirements of the relevant jurisdiction and licensing authority, not for the consumer concerned about the... IRS or something.
The point is that paper receipts are an antiquated way to "prove" a transaction happened in a court, where all a court needs is proof, not a paper receipt. It is a leftover from the industrial age.
The irony being that the blockchain IS irrefutable and better proof, if a court needed something to be proved.

No, it would drive the price of bitcoin up. A million is too small an amount to illustrate this but this might give you a general idea anyway
Right this second, according to bitstamp's order books, If they wanted to buy bitcoin at $335 per bitcoin,  after they spent a million usd buying they would have driven the price of bitcoin up to $337.15. And if they wanted to turn around and sell immediately they would have to take a price of $333
but someone that just wanted to buy and sell smaller amounts of a few hundred dollars at $335 could easily buy at $335 and sell at $335 immediately
because thats how liquidity works.
In more liquid market, like Bank of America stock, someone with hundreds of millions of dollars could buy and sell at the same price all day long.

I am familiar with fibonacci retracements and I have used them to illuminate some things about price action on a chart that may not be so obvious
I also understand that they are completely arbitrary and can be placed anywhere on any chart at any timeframe and that they mean nothing, not even for some psychological voodoo herd mentality that technical analysis relies upon because nobody else is using your exact same fibonacci retracement.
technical analysis was from, and only had an edge in, the 1980s when Wilder was making these random formulas for his trading. and it has just been recycled for the online retail investor over the past decade.
fundamental analysis and quantitative analysis is where its at. keep the support and resistance levels simple, for some volatile swing trades. but all that 1980s chart clutter is not necessary.

I was thinking about unbanked americans when I use the term. But yes, there are different concerns and use cases in other countries. This thread to me has been about people under 18, and I imagined middle class american children that simply wanted to order goods and services online, without needing to do odd things with credit cards (which they don't have access to here). This does happen and I think this particular use case can improve.
What I use bitcoin for? I've registered some businesses with it this year, as my registered agent has been providing a service denominated in bitcoin. I've bought physical goods, electronics, food. I've bought online goods, intangibles such as domain names or fiverr gigs. I've done some trading of altcoins, public companies, gambling at online casinos.
I've most of these things with cash or credit this year too. Registered a business in the US not too long ago, that registered agent doesn't take bitcoin. 
I like the financial privacy that is easily obtainable with bitcoin. I like buying some domain names without there even being a credit card on file that a curious institution could look at to link to me. I like the piece of mind of not having to worry about my credit card numbers being used and sold during some data breach at an undetermined time in the future. I like not having to fill out any forms such as billing address (my home address) for intangible goods that do not need to be shipped.
I like the speed and 24/7 global market access achievable with bitcoin. I don't have a way to trade IPOs in Beijing with cash or my brokerage accounts. Very lucrative opportunities outside of the US. I like getting dividends daily from my speculations directly into my spending wallet, without me having to log into some brokerage account during business hours and transfer cash hoping it arrives the same business day or within the next 5 (its slow in the US).
I've never used bitcoin for anything that is illegal in the United States, so according to you I'm not using it to its full potential.

yes, anybody dealing with any privacy enhancing cryptocurrency is familiar with all the alternatives
what it comes down to is RIGHT NOW if you want your bitcoin transaction to be private you have to think about it, but RIGHT NOW if you want your Monero transaction to be private you don't have to think about it
when you are dealing with a new retailer or person there is a constant thought about exposing how many bitcoins you own by how linked your mobile wallet is to your whatever wallet to the crypto exchange to whatever "but at least my blockchain.info wallet coinjoins!", maybe you don't think about this but I'm sure others do

Within the bitcoin network, mixing makes an illicit origin indistinct from a legitimate origin. Other cryptocurrencies, such as those offering ring signatures, make this also more indistinct without requiring bitcoin's best practices for more privacy.
In an investigation, whether its a tax audit (due to aberrations in tax payments or lack of tax payments and yet new found wealth) or a money laundering charge, one would be very skeptical of information the government is presenting (because in a [federal] money laundering case, the burden or proof is on the government to determine an illicit origin).
audits and money laundering charges can involve legitimate proceeds and illegitimate ones. As in they happen to people running legitimate operations with aberrations in their earnings statements. As such, any "criminal genius" plan would purposefully involve moving funds to places where they will get reported to the government.
Tax evasion is a different animal, and is more related to non-compliance than the others.

its semantical because I originally made a relative comparison, not an absolute of saying bitcoin wasn't risky at all, I said it wasn't risky after making a comparison to a more risky asset.
Since this went over your head, I then went on to clarify that.
And since this still went over your head, because we are now semantically debating what semantic is, then I should clarify that we still aren't talking about logical fallacies. Being experienced in a more risky asset makes bitcoin not risky to me. And for everyone else, what do you need, a tiny disclaimer that says you can lose all or part of your investment? With options and leverage you can lose way more = way more riskier. 
Loosing 100% is nothing. Preschool. Kindergarten for experienced investors. Good luck.

"When you attempt to use the funds" means you will send bitcoins to a bitcoin accepting lawyer. The government doesn't know how you compensated your lawyer, this is confidential.

but why do you want that outcome? the IRS regulation is unfavorable, this is a deflationary asset priced in an inflationary currency, so over time it will gain in value as the inflationary currency declines in value. So it is not good to calculate capital gains every time a purchase is made.
The IRS chose this route because they have no authority to declare it a currency, attacking FinCEN for this inconsistency isn't the best route.
More ideal to get exemptions in place or new regulation for this new asset class in place. One judge in a random district court CAN distort the legal landscape faster than congress can, but the legislative route is more ideal, given the options available.

One would need a protocol about what gets stored in the addresses, each ailment or EHR update needs to adhere to how public/private it could be
The benefit from the blockchain stems from how it could be analyzed by everyone and someone's address could even be written to to notify them of an ailment they or their gene-set is susceptible to
The protocol for what gets stored in someone's address (which is doubling as their EHR) would mitigate the storage/scalability issues to an extent, but a distributed storage dump is also not the solution

false, what you described is not the crime of money laundering. emphasis on crime, and the crime requires illicit origins, which is on the burden of the accuser to prove.

coinjoin = not a trustless solution
darksend+ = attempt at a trustless coinjoin, but is inherently flawed because you have to trust the masternode operators to maintain privacy and assume their Amazon EC2 instances never imaged by curious authorities. it is decentralized but not trustless.
cryptonote = KEYS (not the funds) of multiple users are used in the transaction, an onlooker would not know which key sent the funds or which key received the funds. That is how ring signatures work, but even then with those keys there are only stealth addresses so you cannot even check the balances of key signatures to try and trace the balance. It is a very opaque blockchain.

I did a lot of research into this over summer actually. My patent attorneys found several really interesting patents, that - combined - attempt to solve these problems but do not take into account a blockchain as a solution, in leui of a centralized database or repository
The storage space and privacy issues are still interesting, where it seems like with a public namespace like bitcoin's addresses that it would be up to the user to keep their address (and associated electronic health records) private, much like one keeps a social security number private to remain pseudonymous, and what exactly would be printed in a user's blockchain address is also interesting. Their exposure to this year's flu strain? Their exposure to syphilis? MS? Can cured ailments be pruned from their address to keep blockchain storage space smaller?
Its interesting and can totally leap frog centralized systems in some countries that took a decade to create. But there are a lot of questions regarding scalability

Dark Wallet is inherently not a trustless privacy solution for blockchain technologies
There exists inherently trustless privacy solutions for blockchain technologies
You - and some others - presuppose that any solution using bitcoin's blockchain has more utility - at the sake of trustlessness - than a solution that uses a different blockchain and associated PoW payout mechanism (cryptocurrency). Ultimately, the market has decided that for you already and people have moved their capital into working decentralized trustless mixing solutions when they want, instead of backing "DarkWallet" and Amir's 24/7 PR disaster
and yes, those other projects are begging for funding too!
OpenBazaar doesn't require Dark Wallet's stealth and mixing solution, as it does not require bitcoin nor bitcoin-core forks to complete transactions.

now sure if they actually had revenues, profiting from the spread and stuff, that just helps the valuation get even HIGHER

since I'll have used available cash buying on the way down there, and it would be manageable to pay off debt accrued from buying the amount of bitcoin I want at that price
there are so many other appreciating assets one can only buy with bitcoin, incredibly useful to simply have more bitcoin. speculations in the cryptonote protocol are pretty great and largely immune to a cryptographic problem that bitcoin-core might have (but on the contrary, have their own subset of possible cryptographic problems), so bitcoin can really be at any price to USD, it doesn't matter, I just need more.

typically they throw you in prison for contempt of court until you provide access to the funds

very forward looking statement
do you really think ALL people will stop mining bitcoin once the subsidy halves, over and over again over the next 50 years? Difficulty can adjust downwards, other distributed computing platforms with no subsidy have lasted for over a decade.
do you really think that there won't be enough transactions with fees to support the miners over the next 50 years?
do you really think the nominal value of a fractional bitcoin won't be valuable at times over the next 50 years?
CURRENTLY the .18 btc in each block from all transaction fees is worth very little
CURRENTLY there are not enough transactions in 10 minutes to even have enough aggregate fees to take over the block reward subsidy
but all of these things are temporary problems, the block reward will eventually be less than the aggregate transaction fees earned per block. 
The only problems bitcoin will eventually have to address is how many transactions can occur in a sec, and how many transactions can be included in a block, and how big in megabytes a block can be.

look at how supposedly Shariah compliant institutions let people buy a house, where interest is either forbidden or a  very arbitrary amount of interest is rationalized as "okay" by the local cleric and legal team.
some institutions are doing something similar as 'rent to own' , where the bank owns the house with the new owner and the new owner is simply slowly increasing their share of ownership. For the bank to make the profit, market price of house is just adjusted based on perceived future external factors in the outside world (like interest rate futures).

I understand how darkwallet and darkcoin work, but the darkwallet wiki actually addresses tons of things, such as best practices for anonimity and their obelisk servers, and this is where things get very esoteric. Regarding darkcoin I am very familiar with what darksend is doing and how the masternodes work, it is distributed but it is not trustless. (and neither is darkwallet, but there is some interesting potential with the obelisk servers)
OpenBazaar has some aspects that I'm not really sure if things are addresses, like privacy. For instance, a p2p project like bittorrent actually undermines Tor anonymity, where it is advised not to use bittorrent over tor, and I get the impression that the structure of OpenBazaar does too, but haven't seen how they plan to address that actually or what it really does

oh wait, didn't think of securities trading: worst mistake is holding Ciphermine and ActiveMining shares. Was pretty diversified in mining operations but having all three of the biggest stock exchanges shut down at the same time just wrecked all the share prices and killed liquidity so you couldn't sell.
Got out of most of the operations like Cognitive over time, but the remaining two are still fairly large positions that are probably worthless.
Made the majority of my bitcoin trading AsicMiner shares and some other operations, and the bitcoin digital tokens themselves.

You are doing it incorrectly. This isn't conjecture, YOU ARE VULNERABLE TO THEFT WITH ZERO RECOURSE. Exchanges aren't fucking etrade accounts where you can't get your cash when you want it, it only takes 10 minutes* to transfer your bitcoin YOUR WEALTH to somewhere secure where you can own it and spend it, and ten minutes* back to an exchange if you want to trade it for cash.
*Confirmation time subject to variance

I don't care, I am asking about the utility. You are overestimating the relevance of the exchange and that exchange's relation to the Bobby Lee, and just like when Litecoin's only selling point was "it'll be on Mt. Gox at any moment", this exchange aspect is pure delusion.
I can trade any asset, indeed I entered a trade at .007 ltc/btc and sold at .040 , you can probably see my trade that may have prompted the rally by looking at btc-e's litecoin candlestick chart, hint: its a pretty big candle.

without an internet connection you can still generate a bitcoin address and receive bitcoin. whether you printed the address on a billboard or yelled it across the street or wrote it on employment applications or emailed it to people at an internet cafe or library. 
hence why I specifically said receive and control.
to spend it one would go somewhere with an internet connection, a trader or an atm.
much like an unbanked person goes to check cashing places or a western union portal
a 17 year old can look in the classifieds section and see if there is anything they can do that people already want. unskilled labor has a certain premium, skilled labor has a higher premium.
unlike with cash, they can work for anyone anywhere in the world and get paid. and like checks or cash or anything, they can use the received bitcoin  wherever they can broadcast a transaction.
I understand that this is obvious to me but not to others, but I still don't see why you feel the need to draw a distinction between economies as if there is a difference.

haha alright. I'm not trying to be a mastermind here. This is how 5% of the world's GDP is laundered annual by any estimate anywhere. Regardless of how the 99% live and work.
Within the US, the tax evader would actually pay taxes on the laundered funds they receive as income from the offshore corporation. They will be a contractor. They will also be trying to avoid being indicted for money laundering. But in any case, there needs to be probable cause to even have investigated the money laundering. The idea being that the offshore corporation is not contactable, the offshore corporation's government has no information about you, the offshore registered agent also has no information about you, and you didn't use a clearnet email or anything to subpoena or look at, if there even was probable cause.
But lets go back to actually avoiding taxes, in publicly traded company filings, I have also seen sham unpaid obligations to the employee (or contractor firm) that are "settled" for a service, which would not be income. So for instance, the sham private debt settlement agreement would be that the contractor can live within the property, or gets shares of the corporation by which they receive dividends at a lower tax rate.
Regarding a client list, your clients can be anonymous. You can still provide the client list. They can be walkins, they can be online aliases, in any and all circumstances they may not exist in reality, but appear like they do.

the sucky thing about losing so many bitcoins in these speedbumps is that you'll never get that many back again!
I had a lot tied up in cryptoequities when those stocks traded on exchanges, so there were paper profits that were a pretty big number, although it would have taken a long time to sell those stocks
even though those exchanges gave back funds when they were shut down, the stocks sold off greatly.
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:13:55
the internet and bitcoins are concepts
if there are two computers communicating between each other anywhere, then you have an internet. so it doesn't matter that the internet as we know it could cease existing
similarly bitcoin is a concept and it requires merely two nodes communicating as well
these both are the most smallest possible ways that are both incredible unlikely to happen because there are so many computers being created every day. even if there was some kind of coordinated attack on the internet it sounds like trying to block out the sun.
in any case, everyone else not on the internet can do offline transactions, and periodically update the bitcoin blockchain ledger where the internet exists
so, forget the abstract example I made with two computers. 
Think about places without ubiquitous internet infrastructure right now, people go to internet cafe's. Imagine a place with similar connectivity acting as a western union, people would go there to check their blockchain address balances, and also broadcast transactions (analogous to cashing checks or vendors broadcasting credit card transactions)
@_date: 2014-11-04 23:31:36
and do you realize why the counterparty team was chosen? Its because they launched a decentralized asset exchange for stocks in January 2014 and it works and people actually raise capital with it, right now.
Overstock has hired the counterparty team to build Medici **on top of the counterparty protocol** which also uses bitcoin's blockchain for most things. (in that protocol, issuing assets and smart contracts/derivatives require a negligble amount of the counterparty currency... traders do not need it ever)
The purpose of Medici is to be more favorable to the existing regulatory regimes, instead of undermining them, so that an already public company - like Overstock - doesn't have to wait till 2030 for bitcoin and decentralized exchanges to be relevant.

Bought 50 btc at X price - no tax event yet
Earned 20 btc by day trading - the IRS has an exemption to btc used as a capital asset, with no further guidance on that topic
Lost 19.8 btc trading, leaving with only a possible .2 btc tax event - just keep that in mind for later
Gambling you lost all 50.2 btc - this counts as a 50 btc gambling loss which can be used to offset gambling gains this year, if you get any from another way like perhaps a lottery. Lets say you won a $100,000 lottery, you can deduct $32k from that (from the price the btc were when you lost the gamble), and only pay taxes on $68k
But since you've lost everything, you can forget about it that.
You wouldn't be able to take a capital loss on the bitcoin because its not that you have 50 bitcoins whose value went down to zero, you have zero bitcoins worth zero dollars.
so ya, oops!

your scenario says nothing about that. so which one is your family member? your original post says they run a business and accept funds from vendors. your family member has the funds, if they are an ambiguous stateless international person, then they don't have tax obligations to any one. The vendor still spent money.
Stop trying to back pedal, your family member's argument sucks because this example sucks.
If there was more widespread noncompliance with tax reporting, then the Treasury's revenue collection service will go bankrupt. The end. The country will simply have to find a different way to raise revenues and fund itself.
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency can be used for capital flight, as seen in Russia, Venezuela, Argentina, China and *woah* MAYBE EVEN A COUNTRY YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT. Is that the answer you wanted to hear? Does that scare you? Bitcoin has value because it has utility and is a finite resource. That is one utility, and it says more about you and your family members if that is the greatest and most obvious utility to you guys.

so what I'm thinking about is recurring transactions with retailers, where they can attempt something analogous to pulling from credit cards/accounts but do not have unilateral authority to do it, you can get notified that a transaction is being attempted or is pending, and approve/deny it.
you could be notified in your mobile wallet or via text message or email or in some other central service that you check occasionally
This can be further expanded into autonomous purchases like via an Amazon algorithm that predicts what you want to order
Purchase can't be made if the address doesn't have enough inputs, I think it is great

I am very interested in what Open Assets / Colored Coin is doing, and I like that it is free and lets us discuss it without the fandom associated with being invested in meta/alt coins
but colored coin still is lacking a lot and may have some serious limitations with tracing color in the blockchain efficiently
lets just avoid getting derailed with mastercoin, it sucks and is not necessary.
counterparty on the other hand has a lot of utility, today. there is no possibility that an asset can get uncolored because of using the wrong wallet. it is a huge step forward in asset issuance, a process that still costs upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars in fiat, being leapfrogged for something that is the equivalent of $2 at *today's* exchange rate. sure XCP can be a deflationary asset, but there is also enough utility in it as well to keep it in circulation. but again this is a future problem for future issuers that will have to raise capital, the old exchange Bitcoin Global had a profitable deflationary asset issuing process so I've seen this before, and companies found a way. 
I can also see one scenario where colored coin is like the OTC markets and counterparty is like the Nasdaq
but so many possibilities

first of all, the IRS already does not know how much a business made, and the IRS does not calculate how much they are owed. The IRS relies on a voluntary compliance regime and is able to check less than 1% of taxpayers for accuracy, as is. 
Paying in bitcoin has nothing to do with your supposition. My business earned bitcoin last year and I paid fiat taxes. Even if the IRS had a way to pay in bitcoin, this has nothing to do with transparency.
But lets play along about your future where real time accounting is done.
And the IRS uses a script for their public key to join all the multisig address requests, for a stealth address that they can still see the balances of.
Why not stop there, why not just have a flat tax on bitcoin inputs into that address, and the IRS address gets a cut of everything.
**THIS IS HOW BOTH APPLE AND GOOGLE receive a cut of earnings in their app stores. Money in gets automatically split to them.**
It is interesting you mentioned this, THIS IS ALREADY POSSIBLE WITH THE IRS, you will just have to hold their hand about how to collect it. With an Advance Pricing Agreement and a private ruling from the IRS, you can likely get them to work with you this way. And they would probably like the live earnings too.

and zerocash introduces its own set of problems that zerocoin does not have.
the main problem is that zerocash cannot be created in a trustless way. although it attempts to improve upon zerocoin's accumulators, and zerocoin proof sizes.
The anoncoin implementation of zerocoin addresses both of these issues by pruning proofs after X confirmations, so the blockchain stays small OR maintaining a separate database for the zkProofs which will allow the top blocks to carry more transactions and allow for zkProofs which can be pruned from the database later, maybe where confirmation &gt; X . The accumulators are still going to happen though, but I believe there was an improvement there with how change was going to be obfuscated

Thanks, I still think there would be a demand for more anonymous solutions for these kind of services, outside of vanilla bitcoin.
Coinbase, for example, has complied with financial sanctions and chokepoint operations against bitcoin addresses linked to gambling sites. Limiting Coinbase' own customers from making more transactions.
There needs to be best practices for how to remain anonymous, by plausible deniability, with bitcoin transactions.
Alternative there are more private blockchains in existence and in development that do not yet have payment processors, and are easily interchangeable with bitcoin. Compared to mixers, these alternatives are faster and require no trust.

a) for bitcoin to succeed in the long run it doesn't have to be better than traditional currencies. the "being used in day-to-day consumer merchant transactions" isn't the most valuable part of bitcoin. As a unit of account: asset storage, transparent asset management, and more are way more valuable than people being their own bank or transferring money to Zimbabwe. But all those things are valuable in places obviously not where you are from, and the remittance aspect is huge.
b) As others mentioned the 8000 nodes aren't all hashing. Decentralized inefficiencies aren't the drawback to this technology, but nice try. Nobody is in a race to compare how efficient their database is.
c) your presupposition was that it was X times less efficient than traditional banking or credit card network, and you constructed reasons to support that. Bitcoin's growth has little to do with these aforementioned things.

No, to all four questions.
But it makes me wonder if your skewed perception and farfetched analogies of this issue are more in line with what the general population believes, a broader issue.
The issue isn't the government's goal of preventing social ills, the issue is the government's reaction and the result of criminalizing everyone and their property,  and introduction of cumbersome compliance for everyone and their property which fails to prosecute those that actually are involved in the social ills and only prosecutes individuals that failed compliance.
So lets try this again, without analogies:
The legal fiction of "all sources of earnings are illicit until YOU prove otherwise" was created with the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and 'money laundering' was created as a federal statute with the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986.
In the Eurozone, such legislation was introduced in the late 80s all the way to the early 2000s.
"Failure to legitimize the source of your earnings" simply was not a crime. Operating illegal enterprises is and was a crime.
Tax evasion is a crime and this also was a crime before money laundering legislation. Paying taxes from the proceeds of an illegal enterprise is and was also a crime. Money laundering is making the proceeds from an illegal enterprise look like proceeds from a legal enterprise, it involves obfuscating the origin, and this was not a crime in and of itself. 
The attempt to fill in the gap, where the proceeds are obfuscated (intentionally or non) has simply caught every person and property under the government dragnet. For a MONEY LAUNDERING conviction the government still has the burden of proving that the origin of funds was illicit, which can be difficult to prove if they can never find the origin due to the obfuscation. But the obfuscation itself has been stigmatized, which simply runs counter to the inherent properties of cash.

You have a service to handle your compliance and notify you of refiling dates and auto-renew your entity status with the state? SO FUCKED UP, I can't believe a non-profit run by a man and his wife would opt out of doing all of these things manually! /s

either way the anti money laundering statutes apply, and the record keeping requirements that could not constitutionally apply (unless you WILLINGLY subjected yourself to a VOLUNTARY license with ARBITRARY regulations) are simply part of the licensing maintenance regime
the florida state could have its own anti-"selling to someone that says they were going to commit a crime" law
and I doubt there would be a precedent being set there with this.

lol, well nice first try, but not even close
wallet is a concept from the beginning of bitcoin's source code trying to be relatable. but whereas we generally have one wallet in the physical world, this is not what a bitcoin wallet is.
so first, calm down, you can have as many wallets as you like, and you don't have to keep track of them, because you can move any funds to one central wallet if you want.
At the risk of confusing you, here is something you need to understand
a) bitcoins are stored in addresses
b) wallets are a collection of addresses
if you use a wallet you don't have to think about the addresses inside of them
so everyone's simply trying to help you
Every online service or computer program these days is simply trying to make it so you don't have to think about addresses, but funds in one wallet are compatible with funds in a different wallet, so you can send them anywhere, even to other wallets that you own.
**EXAMPLE** I buy bitcoin with Coinbase. Coinbase takes my US dollars and puts the equiavalent amount of bitcoins into my Coinbase Wallet. All users of coinbase have a coinbase wallet. So mentally, just replace the word "wallet" with "account", like bank account. I then move funds from the coinbase account to a personal wallet I control, which is currently facilitated by the program called Electrum

if blockchain.info just monitors your address for transactions, then it doesn't mean that someone logged in.
it means that someone was able to access your private key, which could be because of a failure in someone's implementation of bitcoin or because  of a compromise in blockchain.info's servers or because of your backup somewhere has been compromised
nothing to do with 2fa, but no need to rule that out either

similarly lets not limit ourselves to NDFs
an options contract will much more easily use less capital for hedging while allowing someone to hedge their assets at the same tick for tick price changes (remaining delta neutral)
Alice is long 1 bitcoin at $500 and is long 1 $500 strike put option for .01 bitcoin. total capital outlay in this example 1.01 bitcoin, although I expect liquid btc options will still have a higher volatility premium. so many variables.
Bob is short 1 $500 strike put option for their covered put income strategy, or multi legged spread (condor, butterfly, bull/bear spread)

Zero Hedge generally reports on a doom and gloom conspiracy angle of reality, but this is just a private US company offering a trading incentive to central banking institutions, entities that have more capital than any other entity.
Them trading S&amp;P futures (instead of .... bonds and treasury notes) puts them directly into the US stock market, where central banks worldwide could raise or lower US stocks (and perception of worldwide economy) in a buying/selling frenzy at the drop of a hat.
Thats the only "controversial" part of this, but I think its the coolest thing ever. If you look at the nature of the financial markets, the history of it and where we are today and where we could be, this is the most amazing source of liquidity one could possibly think of. Truly global.

the bitcoin project uses the git protocol for version control, the git protocol uses pull requests to have code changes be requested to be merged into the original project.
pull requests are visible to all the community
pull requests have to get traction and approved, much like a law has to make it out of committee before going to full Congress for voting, continual review, and added to the code base (although core developers are not voting on changes, they ignore them or add them)
there has to be understanding and public support behind a pull request

Okay this is something some bitcoin gambler's are doing to keep their coinbase accounts open. They have to unlink transactions from gambling websites due to financial sanctions. (This is just one example and something people 
would be more likely to relate to than something criminal)
I analyze two scenarios, Figure A and Figure B. The second scenario being an improvement on the first, with the first illustrating why you would want an improvement.
Figure A, doing this using a one cryptocurrency exchange website
1) obtain bitcoin -&gt; 2) buy monero on exchange -&gt; 3) send monero to your account -&gt; (optional) 4) send monero back to exchange -&gt; (optional)  5) buy bitcoin
Monero is a cryptocurrency built on the cryptonote protocol (no bitcoin-core here, unlike other "altcoins"), the entire network is behind stealth addresses and every transaction uses ring signatures from other stealthed addresses so nobody know the recipient or sender and addresses and there are no addresses to look at in the blockchain because all transactions only have stealth addresses in them. Needless to say, this is all decentralized, compared to a solution like DarkWallet by UnSystem which can use stealth addresses for Bitcoin and mixing but relies on a server for the mixing. And stealth addresses in a system where others addresses are public has a weak link in those public addresses. And confirmation times with Monero are faster than bitcoin, so any bitcoin mixing service to unlink transactions will be a lot slower. Allow me to reiterate that Monero does not use mixing.
Lets analyze figure A. In steps 1, 2, and 3 the cryptocurrency exchange has a record of your addresses (and Monero's payment IDs), in theory this exchange could be subpoena'd to at least see that there was a payment ID and a certain amount sent. Might possibly be useful for reasonable suspicion if there was already a suspect and authorities needed a warrant to confirm that suspect's wallet or service had a matching payment ID for an old transaction (since you wouldn't be able to determine this in Monero's blockchain)
Steps 4) and 5) assume you even want bitcoin. There are more bitcoin goods and services than there are for Monero, so this is plausible. There are Monero gambling services, for instance. The cryptocurrency project is about the financial privacy non-bitcoiners can relate to already, but in a trustless way. For someone simply wanting to unlink transactions, going back to bitcoin at all is actually redundant whether you want to hear it or not, or are apprehensive about someone trying to "pump an altcoin". This is the utility, and the cryptonote protocol might not have some of the utility that the bitcoin protocol has, so consider that the objective analysis.
So lets look at Figure B, doing this with two cryptocurrency exchange websites
1) obtain bitcoin -&gt; 2) buy monero on exchange -&gt; 3) send monero to your account -&gt; 4) send monero to **DIFFERENT** address or (optionally) exchange -&gt; (optional)  5) buy bitcoin
step 4 is now no longer optional and simply now introduces the possibility that two exchanges would need to be subpoena'd to ATTEMPT to track the funds, increasingly unlikely but perhaps all monero exchanges would be subpoena'd at once for particular payment IDs. But here is where things get interesting. The first exchange had Monero sent to an unknown address. The second exchange had Monero received from an equally indistinct unknown address. Transactions in the blockchain show payment IDs and amounts, so you would want to do this in at least two transactions (not sure if the Monero client does this for you, I forget, it is a VERY opaque blockchain).
Again though, even if your Monero account was inspected under a warrant and reasonable suspicion because of step 3. Step 4 allows you to maintain plausible deniability about controlling the funds. Any transaction from your account whether it is to a different account you control or to an exchange is indistinct. If you sent it to an exchange there is just that POSSIBLE weak link that the exchange's database is inspected by authorities for a matching payment ID in the past, to relink the funds. If you sent it to a different address that wasn't for a good or service then this would never happen. But after wards those funds are equally as fungible or liquid.
( thoughts on this method for unlinking transactions? made some assumptions about subpeona's, plausible deniability and neglected viewkeys because I've never used them and I'm not sure what would be revealed in them if someone were coerced into revealing one to authorities)

if funds are swept, moved, gone, there isn't some small trickle people get to watch and make objective decisions about, it is a total irrecoverable loss that people get to watch helplessly

Application Specific Integrated Circuit, that is what ASIC means.
ASIC resistant means that you build an Application Specific Integrated Circuit whose sole application is efficiently solving ASIC resistance.
An Application Specific Integrated Circuit is the least sophisticated endeavor in engineering. The last 30 years of general processor competition (CPUs) was to be able to do ALL applications quickly, instead of making a bunch of ASICs that do individual applications quickly. There is no such thing as ASIC resistance.

the BITCOINS are not subject to FBAR (and probably never will be with the current laws), some paranoid individual decided to ask the IRS anyway
FIAT in a foreign financial institution over $10,000 at ANY POINT IN TIME must be reported. So if you traded out of bitcoin an amount over $10,000 and it was in a place outside the united, whether it was btc-e bitstamp mtgox... then you are subject to file.
And you are damned sure they already know about it, if it was bitstamp or mt gox.

The problem is that the date is in the article is not significant at all. April 5th 1975 is not a significant date it is a combination of a date in 1933 and - ambiguously - THE ENTIRE YEAR OF 1975, which makes no sense, for the first part to be so granular and the second part to be so broad. Prohibitions against gold ownership we relaxed starting April 24, 1964 , and at an unspecified time in 1975 free trade of it was completely allowed (after everyone was already doing it and it was common place, so then what January 1st 1975? is that the exact day some super relaxed policy passed beforehand came into effect? Or did a regulator change their mind much later in the year?)
Unless Satoshi explicitly said this was his reasoning for picking those two dates for one single fake birthdate, then this article is completely anecdotal (and it wouldn't have even more significance even if Satoshi did confirm it)

Sorry I'm not really interested in your case study, not to dismiss your newest reasons to not use bitcoin, but this would undermine my own privacy and trade secrets for my businesses.
I've used Namecheap for domain names. Sometime I shop around for others if I want a particular TLD.
The illiquidity and volatile markets go hand in hand and are not permanent features of bitcoin.
I don't consider myself using them for idealogical reasons. Amongst my speculations in cryptocurrency there are many things that can only be bought with bitcoin. Such as those publicly traded securities and other altcoins. Bitcoin is extremely useful to me and I have great banking relationships in fiat.
I think you are under the assumption that consumer adoption actually matters for bitcoin, such as to justify your investment or lack of investment. This is the false issue, bitcoin is an advancement for services that have nothing to do with ecommerce. The lucrative industries for bitcoin are the finance industry, the financial products that work better in bitcoin than in the centralized cash clearing and settlement system. These eclipse merchant/consumer adoption in all metrics, and is simply a matter of infrastructure till these things are practical.
E-commerce and peer 2 peer spending is simply a perk. I think its become clear to me where your questions have come from now.

I do. There is a more indepth discussion about orphaned blocks, network propagation, alignment of incentives, hard forks, and blockchain size.
and the cryptonote protocol ignores most of these discussions in favor of flexibility (and unlinkable transactions, the elephant in the room)

"I have about $22k in a 401k account that is not a retirement account."
what? anything in a 401k is retirement funds.
Taking the penalty is stupid as there is no legal reason that 401k funds cannot hold bitcoin except the technicality of your banking institution not offering it to you. 
Protip: 401k funds do not have to be stored in a bank, just don't fuck up co-mingling them with anything else (and failing to pay the penalty).

slippage? liquidity begets liquidity, and I maintain that even now slippage is less expensive and faster than bitcoin mixing services.
the nature of the sanctions against financial institutions servicing gambling sites is but one example of why someone would want to unlink or obfuscate transactions. so for your gambling example, probably simply sending bitcoin to other addresses before going to coinbase or whatever is likely fine. but the fact coinbase was even attempting to detect this was a surprise to all of us merely a month ago
there are plenty other reasons why people want to unlink transactions
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:23:01
I think BIP70 is closer to the solution of this problem
basically software wallets could be instructed to map outputs in its set of addresses, to a series of addresses the merchant provides
and never mixing funds from different addresses
even the merchant wouldn't know if one person was actually in control of those addresses
so QR codes and bitcoin: uri's could contain different kinds of instructions, instead of just one address to pay to. Could even have a handshake process where additional payment addresses are requested via api
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:29:02
public addresses are not IN any country.  they aren't bank accounts or like bank accounts in any way shape or form. A public key can be any address whether someone controls the private key or not. If it is a validly formed address the transaction will be sent to that address, nobody can verify the location of someone that may currently have the private key to that address.

its not that TOR isn't magic, the government's explanation was magic. 
The FBI affidavit from Tarbell even included a link to how one would properly configure TOR, but it was for TOR exit nodes (and explained how someone could accidentally misconfigure it), the only problem is that the Silk Road was not an exit node - it was a hidden service, hidden services have their own configuration tutorial on the same wiki, oops.
The FBI affidavit was a sloppy lie.
The defense lawyers caught the FBI in their lie, and even got to analyze a copy of the Silk Road server just to make sure. The government's latest response (what we are discussing here), is that the government doesn't even try to dispute that they were caught lieing.

government insurance isn't for you. it isn't intended to give YOU peace of mind. you still rely on the intermediary (banks) to act accordingly, the odds of them freezing your funds or you needing to go to court to get them back some months/years later is much greater than needing government insurance to keep your funds available.
banks know they can speculate with your deposits, because you will pay for their fuckups with taxes.

Although I am skeptical of this aspect given current realities, it still seems that with any modest adoption, the block reward will become less of a reward than the transaction fees as planned
its also easy to imagine that as global internet infrastructure improves over the next decade, and decade after that, it will be more practical to consider increases the block sizes from 1 megabyte to something larger without risking more orphan blocks

With my trading style, especially if I am long a volatile asset, I open a position with a general price target but don't consider it the best price possible, yet a catalyst can come a long any time. So I will 'double down' at a lower pre-determined price if the fundamentals are still in my favor to both bring my average entry price down and deploy more capital at a position I'm confident in.
But look, if I could write puts on bitcoin I would. Then at least I would be earning more capital while lowering my entry price if exercised.

Yes, if all the reasons WHY it will make me wealthy are also all fulfilled.
Are stocks, bonds, derivatives, futures priced in bitcoin? Is raising capital on a decentralized market place easier than kickstarter is today without the 8% haircut and instant? Are decentralized stock exchanges liquid? Can I vote on Apple's company management changes as a shareholder from my wallet? Is my electronic health record in a blockchain maintaining privacy and contributing to social capital? Is my genome in the blockchain being used for predictive health care? Is it easy to be exempt from the volatility of bitcoin's USD exchange rate? Are notaries gone? Can I do routine mundane banking domestically and internationally on holidays and weekends? Are redundant public institutions replaced by blockchain equivalents?
I look at these things and see that something which can be used to denominate ALL US equities is cheaper than a single US equity.
Meanwhile, you guys are just sitting in a corner waiting for merchants and consumers to adopt it. Who cares? E-commerce is like a 60 billion USD industry and we're talking about 100 trillion dollars worth of derivatives alone

Its just to correct your misinformation for those passing by, not to query for how many fucks you have to give
Circle is only $500 instant. And it is only possible to get $2500 out of Circle, at all, and this takes 3-5 business days. Any amount after the $500 instant that week takes 3-5 business days, and then you are frozen from making any new purchases that week.
Coinbase is $1000 instant that week, and it slowly replenishes so you can make incremental instant purchases within the next 7 days if you want. Coinbase also has a $50,000 limit weekly for non-instant transactions.
Coinbase is better in this regard.
Between Circle and Coinbase one can get $1,500 bitcoins weekly instantly. Great for taking advantage of price fluctuations and deals.

if thats the dilemma how would you distinguish real from fake?
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:02:40
thats not what I considered a valid counterpoint, because the zerocoin information gets deleted/pruned from the blockchain after X number of confirmations, which will be set to a few days. Also the proof of work sizes aren't that big, seems like this is something that is continually refined.
Without the deletion I could see this being burdensome.
Darkcoin is implementing darksend and coinswap, these are all just more and more obfuscation on a transaction going from point a to point b, and maybe some opt in mixing like darkwallet. still betting on zerocoin. but I picked up some DRK as I'll be investing in all of the privacy related development efforts.
At the end of the day, multisig and colored coin implementations are eventually going to be agnostic enough to work on all of these blockchains. And I think all of the ones with privacy technologies will have a lot more utility and demand, as issuing securities and raising capital or donating to a cause (read: campaign) that may not be popular in the future will become more in demand
an implementation of bitcoin is blamed for vulnerabilities regularly enough... one time all android wallets used a wrong random generator from google that wasn't random enough and people could sometimes figure out private keys based on TXIDs. transaction malleability is another one that just relied on people implementing bitcoin in a negligent way. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 15:11:40
after only following colored coins, and eventually getting schooled, this is my impression to.
For colored-coin equivalent features, counterparty is just like colored coin and you don't need any counterparty to do things, only btc. For more advanced features like bets and derivatives and other contracts, you need the counterparty to do it
so its like the best of both worlds with counterparty

Some bets have positive expected value, other bets have negative expected value. And then there is everything in between.

I buy digital goods and services with bitcoin
Many times, services do not need your name/address/email/phone number to complete a purchase, this is just something credit card companies have been requiring
Lately things on the list:
- domain names
- visual arts
- business registrations
I also speculate in altcoins, so I earned a lot of bitcoin by trading darkcoin
Occassionally speculated in bitcoin denominated equities and bitcoin mining companies, but this used to a be a much more diverse space last year
I don't do much in person transacting with btc, nor do I find the current infrastructure for "mobile payments" to be appealing whether it is nfc or qr codes. A card based transaction like coinkite is more ideal and natural for me. but a new Point of Sale system like coinkite isn't practical, if bigger stores/debit/credit institutions offered btc holdings on cards that would be ideal

"a) a plain statement of the SEC’s lack of jurisdiction with regards to Bitcoin, thus alligning itself with the position of the US FED and the US GAO"
The SEC's jurisdiction stems from the Securities Act of 1933, under definitions. The unit of trade (currency, barter) does not factor in considering if something is a security of regulated contract. This was NEVER up for dispute -but- the Pirate40 court case should be sufficient case law if anyone ever needs clarification. There was no effort to prevent SatoshiDice shares from being traded by americans so that gives the SEC the "in" they need to at least try and get information.

this is a healthy discussion but these are not the issues with coinjoin and darkcoin+darksend+
compared to other aforementioned solutions Darksend+ is not the trustless coinjoin improvement you want
**EVERYONE** knows where all the masternodes are, everyone knows they are all on Amazon EC2 and Digital Ocean. Operators and authorities can image the masternode instances anytime they want to analyze and deobfuscate transactions. You are trusting that this never happens, you are trusting that the masternode operator isn't recording transactions, you are trusting that no masternodes are acting in collusion.
in comparison, yes cryptonote coins have a big blockchain! yes, I think this could stifle adoption, yes, I think there may exist a solution to this, but also yes ring signatures are a more trustless solution.

yes, but you also must put into perspective how the market reacted to the "bearwhale". Because that was simply in addition to the 1.3 million coins produced. The bitcoins coming on the market are much more numerous by a factor of 3 than the bearwhale incident.
The exchanges are illiquid because people know better than the park their funds on them.
All of it is adding to the resiliency of bitcoin's exchange rate.

not as big of a problem as suggested
it is very easy to detect double spends in the network, and if a controlling pool was blocking transactions or blocks then you as someone accepting bitcoins could extend confirmation wait times till another pool gets blocks, which would happen eventually
it would be a temporary speedbump to confidence just by people that haven't experienced this sort of thing before

A "bitcoin" is merely an input into an address. When those inputs are moved (a transaction) they are outputs from that address (and inputs into another address).
All participants in the network know where all of the inputs have been transferred at any point in time.
And all inputs come from a block originally, which all participants in the network also have. The blocks all have a distinct cryptographic signature, as such if you tried to make up a block or make up an input, no other participant in the network would have this information and all participants in the network would reject that information. This is why you cannot "copy it" because the existing network will reject it. Your "fake bitcoin" (you can't even get that far) cannot be used in the network because of this.
Feel free to ask me any questions.

yeah move the bitcoin to an exchange, buy Monero (this features unlinkable transactions), move the Monero to your address, and then back to the exchange, back to bitcoin
and you will have clean bitcoin. because it came from an exchange's coffers instead a casino's coffers.
this has nothing to do with gambling, all monero transactions are unlinkable.
Coinbase and everyone is able to track bitcoin that has touched a gambling address.
This method is much faster than a "mixer" because because Monero has fast confirmations times. The stealth addresses and ring signatures make it so that blockchain analysis does not reveal who actually sent what from where

I don't get the structural difference of i2p, in comparison to TOR, either. But TOR's node system do appear to be a great topic of examination from various parties.
That paper talks about finding nodes paths within TOR (to locate hidden services) by monitoring small CPU clock changes when taxing node processors with data, something they expect to happen when the temperature rises. Some seriously advanced stuff compared to how I would have previously thought about these issues.

its a deeper problem than that.
Zerocash is a successor to Zerocoin made by the same people and has nothing to do with Zerocoin. It also isn't an upgrade, just completely different.
The only people implementing Zerocoin is the Anoncoin team. All of their communication takes place on i2p IRC, and Anoncoin's bitcointalk thread, and their active github repository. Zerocoin = function, Anoncoin = existing cryptocurrency.
Zerocash = new function, Zerocash team still plans to make a cryptocurrency for a proof of concept.
Since this has nothing to do with the Zerocoin website I don't know what to tell you, except there is a demand for privacy technologies within cryptocurrencies and releasing that book with that particular solution glossed over would further misinformation, since others would be seeking to quote a book over a website, or forum thread or chatroom.

lol, no. The controlled substances act has far more teeth than the alcohol amendment of the 1920s ever did. The feds have jurisdiction over interstate commerce, and courts expanded that jurisdiction via CASE LAW starting in the late 1930s (and although this power was always in the constitution... the likelyhood of interstate commerce only really began in the 20th century with cars and planes). The majority of the New Deal was struck down as unconstitutional, entire federal agencies disbanded, but the real legacy is the case law it created.
The federal government has completely subjected the states at this point, and any discrepancy is merely at the whim of the federal government's tolerance.

yes, that is correct
1) He was not using TOR when caught and would access his silk road server for administrative purposes from a cafe
2) In the past, he had ordered things from silk road to his address and federal agents had delivered them, this was unrelated to the investigation into him running it
3) He had used his name and email initially advertising silk road , and on stackoverflow asking some technical questions related to it
4) It doesn't matter if he was using TOR the whole time, using your actual name had the feds looking for "Ross Ulbricht" and that person was easily found and things that person did support the feds investigation for the silk road administrator. If he was using TOR **and** didn't mess up with his identity then it would have been more difficult
There was really nothing sophisticated involved in tracking him down, read an indictment or two

If anyone gets bank account and routing number (routing number can be guessed by the way, and is not private information), they can authorize payments from that bank account. These are also written in plain text on checks. This can also be accomplished by getting debit card numbers and pins.
Circle doesn't use bank accounts and routing numbers because it doesn't use the ACH network, it uses bitcoin.
The ACH network also takes three business days to complete a transaction, and we know how bitcoin works here.

basically algorithms now have a way to finance themselves, and can interface with the human world to acquire goods and resources to complete their algorithmic goals.
an example of this: some bitcoin faucets display a captcha that a human has to solve, if the human solves it they get some bitcoin, the program actually encountered that captcha on another site and is blocked by it until the human unknowingly solved it for the program. Now the program has access to the resources it was looking for by exchanging with a human.
before bitcoin this was not possible, and more specifically in the realm of computer science, the double spend problem was just one of those unsolvable problems that hindered computer science until the creation of bitcoin in 2009, so now algorithmic processes and computer science in general can keep evolving based on the potential that everyone already knew, there was just no way for the programs to finance themselves

That only reveals that Ripple XRP is overvalued and illiquid. The mere threat of 9 billion ripple being sold into the market caused a selloff of 70%, yet that 70% was only caused by 500 million ripple being sold, which also isn't worth that much.
If you don't get it yet, it means that less than 1% of ripple actually being sold crashed the market 70%.

well the 30 yr treasury bonds offer 3% which is $30,000/yr right there lol, and those interest payments are exempt from state and local taxes (if your state and locale taxes income)
if ye have little faith in the treasury's ability to pay at some point in the future, you can also buy put options on the possibly declining value of the bond, or sell the bond back on the open market.
so, US treasuries are the benchmark in safety. if you are getting a less yield than that, time to reevaluate.

No. That is not what money laundering is, it disturbs me that you have upvotes on that answer.
For TAXATION purposes, money laundering deters people from obtaining money from "illicit origins", it is part of the tax firewall. Where on one hand it is a crime not to pay taxes, and on the other hand it is a crime to pay taxes with laundered funds.
"When they can prove you spent stolen cash without declaring it" related, but no. All your EARNINGS have to be accounted for, and whether you spent it, paid taxes on it whatever, the tax authorities want to know where it came from. If it is an illicit source (stolen, other) then you get in trouble, if it has no source then you get in trouble, if you don't pay taxes on it, you get in trouble.

@_date: 2014-09-07 20:36:53
It doesn't matter that MN's have no reasonable way to know if they're facilitating a crime.
The point is that an authority would be simply following a transaction they suspected of being used in a crime, get images of masternodes hosted in data centers (because we know all the masternode IP addresses, and if masternodes were hidden on tor or whatever, they could simply go to popular hosting providers and ask for instances running masternode software) and simply follow the transaction. The EXACT antithesis to financial privacy that darksend purports to offer. This has nothing to do with indicting a masternode owner, this has to do with having established probable cause and getting a warrant or mutual assistance treaty. The masternode owner would never know their instance was imaged over and over and over again. So no, you can't trust that "doing such a thing would be illegal in most jurisdictions due to the random legal analogy you made that has nothing to do with why a masternode would be compromised".
I like Evan's incentives (masternodes require X drk to run, and earn Y drk for running) and I think there is value there, but TRUSTING the confidentiality of masternodes is a fool's game because it is inherently flawed for financial privacy

b) everyone doesn't have to have the internet, there are internet cafes, and these places or similarly specialized places can be hubs to broadcast transactions in the future

yes, watch the price continue going down, I'll be buying until something fundamental changes. And the only thing that has changed so far is that influential people actually are working to make decentralized cryptoequities a thing, solidifying the infrastructure necessary to add utility to a bitcoin. As noted, neither colored coin or counterparty existed a year ago, and now they work, are funded, and are being improved by established players in the existing financial system.

as someone that used to be emotionally invested in colored coins, conceptually, and hated tertiary coins like Mastercoin, I realized that counterparty is better.
both colored coins and counterparty use the blockchain, and for people actually interested in owning shares and assets - neither require any altcoin, only bitcoin. XCP is used for ISSUING an asset "anti-spam protection" as they say, and XCP exists in abundance, costs $2 to launch a stock or asset. That's fine, this isn't a drawback.
more complicated contracts also require XCP, and colored coins cannot do these things.

wow guys read the pretrial motion Joshua Dratel released yesterday
first off all, you are using case law from 1990, Dratel has case law from all the way to July 31st, 2014, specifically one that says even foreign agents under mutual legal assistance treaties are expected to abide by us constitutional protections
Its a nice 102 pages that goes in depth very deeply about why the fourth amendment applies and concurring decisions from many circuit courts including the ones they are in and supreme court decisions, invalidating the practices of the agents and magistrate judge that allowed the warrant
Now the government has to prove the method that had them seek out the servers located there, which they have declined to give
if the court orders them to of course
anyway, my opinion of this is that the court has enough information to strike most of this case down, and if not, this case is dead on appeal within that district or practically any district in this country

I've seen the whimsical smart hoverboard donation signs all over the subway entrances, saw it posted on reddit once to a muted response
I've seen to the moon written everyone, maybe have seen a picture also posted on reddit
Satoshi Square events were never posted on r/Bitcoin until maybe 4 hours before they were already scheduled to happen, which is not a practical announcement

Nope. how they decided to make a warrantless Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty request for "the second to the top server at this particular data center in Iceland" for a TOR hidden service where nobody knows the location is just as valid of a question as the reason they didn't get a warrant
The feds didn't initially reveal what country that server was seized from.
Maybe maybe somehow they had established probably cause for that one particular server rack via network analysis and investigative means, but its really improbable, and this tool wouldn't need to be omitted from the other disclosures of the government.
Parallel construction is more likely, and illegal. The blanket sweeping of american communications, being sent to law enforcement agencies for law enforcement to re-construct how they would have legally found this lead.
Maybe they cracked TOR, immediately alerting all others of steps they need to take, and diminishing their future investigative ability
And maybe Ross did something clumsy.

an individual masternode is not trustless, we know all of their IP addresses, so would any snooping data center operator or curious fbi hacker or nsa, to monitor what transactions they mix from what addresses
this isnt theory, it happens
this means that YOU cannot rely on the masternode network to appropriately delink your blockchain transaction, because you have no idea what information the masternode is storing.
the **ONLY** benefit over bitcoin mixers is that you can trust that you'll actually receive your coins back, and the confirmations are much much faster.
now with that in mind, I think the masternode compensation scheme is genius, and is great for a cryptocurrency network (especially the fact that they require 1000 DRK to operate). I would like to see the Darksend code. I think the concept should be extended to full nodes. The block reward + transaction fees being split between miners, full nodes and whatever else needs to be incentivized.

It doesn't have to be bitcoin's blockchain
It can be, but in the past the bitcoin tribunal has limited progress on this front by decreasing how much metadata can be in each transaction
It is very likely that a valuable niche could appear on blockchain that is more valuable than bitcoin
And this has nothing to do with "first mover advantage" with consumer adoption, much like how the bond market is much much much larger than the stock market, in terms of market capitalization, which is much bigger than actual commerce in sectors
One blockchain is capable of many things, but many blockchains can exist

I upvoted you, but having manipulated my credit score for years I have to ask: have you tried a secured credit card? where you give the bank like $200 and they give you a card with $200 in credit? This builds your credit score
After this, banks won't ask what you do for a living, they just ask for your annual salary. Which you can totally make up (but due to a possible edge case circumstance, I would not recommend doing)
Also, for a very low overhead cost you can make an LLC in any state of your choosing and say that LLC is your employer, come on lifehack your way into the establishment :)

They didn't catch him by "hacking TOR" or whatever you want the peace of mind about. They caught him in very unsophisticated ways, basically google.

thats interesting, so for general consumption like trendy electronics, it doesn't take a lot of money for new playstations and phones to stop making any kind of dent at all. You get a $25,000 cushion and suddenly $500 or 2% isn't a lot.
that leaves a $975,000 gap of nothing to buy, before you get to millionaire zone. Then there are some luxury goods, quite contrived purchases for illiquid asset holders of boats and houses looking for people to buy from them.

Okay, I read the article now, this was worse than a stretch.


The year? The whole year? The first day of the year?
So it is now saying that April 5th, 1975 has no significance whatosever and is instead a portmanteau of TWO days, one actual day in 1933 and the *entire year of 1975*
even though "the day americans could legally own gold again" happened at a particular day because of the effect of a particular law or change in policy which is not cited
Unless Satoshi directly said this was the reason for that date, then the entire article is purely anecdotal and just grasping for a story.

there are so many problems with your logic and hypothetical problem
depends on where you are domiciled, none of this really matters if you or your subsidiaries are (supposed to be) taxed on your earnings
lets start from the beginning, you have clients in the UK and you are a citizen of X located in Y, what is X and what is Y
austria's bank secrecy for non-austrians expires in 2016 and they have automatic digital information sharing infrastructure already set up (within the EU, and by proxy the US, and anyone that asks)
if profits from BTC are not taxed in Denmark, then why do you need to buy bitcoin in Denmark? That would be where to sell it obviously since there is no capital gain or income
whats wrong with SEPA bank transfer? the paper trail?

my reasons are different than yours

my eli5 understanding: fiat earns interest, interest is paid from new fiat = greater supply of fiat.
there is a deeper explanation that involves the role of banks, lending, treasury bonds, the federal reserve and actual economic output

While I believe both of your arguments are flawed, the several courts have ruled that bitcoin is money. There is no conflict within the court system necessary for the Supreme Court to revisit this matter.
The IRS is not capable of designating things as currency outside of what Congress allows it, so it chose property, for tax purposes.

Western Union has helped these people. Western Union is providing a popular service. Western Union is now a household name.

I've missed many trading opportunities making damned sure not to trade BTC for fiat until a liquid US exchange comes online.
I rode litecoin up from .005/btc to .045/btc , and transferred it between two exchanges and then coinbase and sent the btc to my US bank account waiting the 4 business days and paid the coinbase fee.
INSTEAD of simply cashing out to USD on bitstamp or BTC-E and waiting for a better re-entry price.
I keep thinking, maybe this year lots of people are just filing FBARs while trading on bitstamp, but then I look around at the gross misunderstanding of regulations in cryptocurrency land and realize I just need to do what works for me.

what if I told you that you could be immune to declines in bitcoin price
@_date: 2014-07-05 22:22:22
because you might not move funds or "change inputs" in a month, from that particular address
the exchange rate fluctuation is a good point, this difference could be automatically refunded too (which would create more transactions for the network, a good thing), and the new readjusted transactions would account for the current exchange rate
true about having all the money upfront, either way the merchant could be offering a different rate for recurring monthly payments vs yearly payments. yet again though, they could presign recurring yearly payments that a script could also handle.

nothing. all bitcoin and all these altcoins are doing is paving the way for introduction to decentralized block chain technologies which can be easily upgraded. the block chain solved the "double spend" problem that has plagued computer science since it became a study, just like the n-body problem has plagued physics studies for the last 2,000 years, just like the other fields are stumped by problems that aren't solved yet.
people are placing too much emphasis on the "network effect" of a random block chain technology like bitcoin or litecoin just like people placed too much emphasis on the network effect of steam locomotives. We still use the tracks but railroad stocks are bust. Nothing changes about this just because cryptocurrencies are a different more fungible asset class. These developers are not and will not upgrade their cryptocurrency for certain competitive block chain technologies.

One time they totally messed up my order with the credits, like I think Bitpay was blocking TOR or maybe coinbase broadcast my transaction after bitpay's 15 minute window or maybe their actual domain name registration blocked TOR
And I had to talk to customer support about it, but I was on TOR and wouldn't give any information about myself and they said they needed information about the source of the funds for the Office of Foreign Asset Control regulations and I told their dumbasses that they already had the funds transferred to the account so that ship has sailed and they credited the funds
But even that bullshit red tape would have been avoided if they just let people make purchases directly without the whole account crediting nonsense!

nope,  simply uses adjectives to refer to specific blockchains instead of calling them altcoins
the 'coin' moniker also needs to go away, it is a misnomer that has confused and distracted every influential person on this planet about what bitcoin is. It also highlights a lack of originality amongst the thousands of forks

a) why the fuck are you using the qt-wallet? do you even know why? "because it was the first result on google" is not the right answer. but this won't effect the confirmation time, I'm just saying you can get 18 gigabytes of your hard drive space back.
b) how many confirms are you talking about? like 20 blocks have been found since you posted that. Either Coinbase decided not to broadcast your transaction to the network yet, your bitcoin client requires more confirmations then you should be comfortable with.

He has a misunderstanding of how manufacturers, bankers and speculators make money. His quote of "have them make $30 a month - the same wage as the lads in the trenches" can only appeal to the lads in the trenches and fellow wage slaves.
bankers and speculators make money from their own money, any salary at all just goes toward their capital. Having them earn a wage isn't the punishment he describes.
they will still be writing options, earning 20-50% a week if they want, and making waaaay more than $30 a month. 
Or at least, I would.

money laundering has only been "wrong" since 1970, and many political families in the United States and worldwide would have been criminals if this was inherently wrong during the previous decades and milleniums of currency and never obtained the wealth to support their politics
Similar incongruences happen to this day.
Money laundering as a label, a crime, an action, is not a public disorder. It is a reaction and poorly thought out solution used as a tool to prevent public disorders such as "terrorism" "pedophilia" "sex trafficking" "drug trafficking" and every body else engaging in day to day transactions.

you would only ask that question if you didn't understand some fundamentals, it can be esoteric to visualize so let me see if I can help illustrate:
right now, if there was only 1 bitcoin in circulation it would have an exchange rate of $4,611,848,699 , $4.6 billion dollars, for brevity.
1 bit (mBTC) would be worth $4,611 dollars.
and people would transact daily in 1/100,000th of a bit, roughly 4 cents. The community would have likely made a new denomination for this reality, and the source code would have been modified to allow for more than 8 decimal places of a bitcoin. This would simply mean that when the owner of the 1 bitcoin wanted to buy groceries, then the grocer would have exchanged food for some fraction of a bitcoin. And that grocer is able to exchange that fraction of a bitcoin for other goods and services.
There is still bitcoin in circulation.
No new bitcoin was created.

zerocoin is not a coin
anoncoin is implementing it.
the confusion comes from the fact that the guys who originally made the zerocoin spec had stated that they were going to make their own alt-coin. those guys in turn got ADHD and created zerocash which is a new privacy thing and will have its own digital token, this is all very different than zerocoin.
anoncoin has been around for almost a year now and doesn't currently offer anything except a low float (4 million coins, 5 coin block reward) and some rudimentary I2P routing about your node information. It will have a coordinated hardfork when zerocoin is ready. their development team is actively working on and looking at all privacy related technologies for anoncoin. (btw anoncoin's market cap has fallen to about $600,000 .... only ~900,000 coins mined so far... interesting upside if people find utility in zerocoin and I2P routing, where the network doesn't know your IP and the network doesn't know your balance in the blockchain)
lets see, what else. Oh, zerocash... now you have more questions :) the paper on zerocash is being released on may 18th at the latest, nobody knows what they are doing yet. There is controversy with zerocash about its need to have "trusted parties" create some initial key at launch, which hasn't happened yet.
regardless, zerocoin has a counterpoint to every privacy-related blockchain technology that has been proposed. the only valid counterpoint to zerocoin is that "its complicated maths may have a vulnerability" basically like an implementation of bitcoin every other month.

malicious entity wanting to spam the blockchain will have to raise their fees even further if they ever want their spam transactions to make it into the block
we would all notice if blocks are continually full or if mining all-of-a-sudden became super lucrative, and investigate or start mining ourselves, if the investigation was that stupid transactions were being created by a malicious entity we would not accept their transactions or greedy miners might and they make more than everyone else and we all compete for the transactions

back in 2011, 2012 and early 2013, all before I decided to start acquiring bitcoin, I was very frustrated with the illiquidity.
At this point, the illiquidity is nowhere near how bad it was. The volatility is comparatively low. The spreads are not as wide, hundreds of thousands of dollars can hit the orders book and not even nudge the price. It is good enough for the 99%
I would like to see the spreads be a fraction of a cent and millions of dollars resting on the best bid and ask, like a liquid US security. I would like to see a real and liquid US exchange (not a Circle or Coinbase, more like a Coinsetter after they get their infrastructure better)
I traded securities more so in 2013, and those exchanges are gone. The decentralized securities solutions are too illiquid for my interests, but I can see market makers coming into those just like I can see market makers coming into stronger better regulated bitcoin/fiat exchanges.

yeah after I wrote this I immediately thought of variants. Is it possible to "co-issue" like that, this seems impractical since an issuer would have to wait, but I could see an existing institution trying to enforce that.
Lets say there were less regulated assets like ones on the OTC Bulletin Boards in the United States, when they transfer to the Nasdaq larger market, the institutions that approve that would sign the existing asset by just transmitting some super small portion of that asset with their signature, and that would always be in the blockchain. Obviously this is not multisig, so that was a misnomer.

Perhaps it was a clever "checkmate" you put defendant into, but the federal judge dismissed the case.

They didn't even consider the merit of your initial claims. They didn't even consider if there was initially a wrongdoing against you.

It isn't like the blockchain where you don't have to trust nodes to have everything in it - else they get rejected from the network, here you have to trust humans to point out the fallibility of the trusted developers.

getting bitcoin from the old people corporations will require a bank account, credit card and all that stuff that you need an adult for, due to age limits those old people corporations have to follow
getting bitcoin in exchange for goods and services, or for cash in person, has no age limit
you can then spend those bitcoin for online stuff without needing an adult's credit card or any other gimmicky work around

it works and there are things to be learned from it as well as ways to improve and build on top of the concept further, its not coinjoin or mixing or a masternode or a dark wallet or bitcoinfog, or a promise of a future technology like zerocash or zerocoin, or an IPO coin, or a premine dump, or an instamine
I think we all agree that other blockchains dilute our investments
People make these other blockchains because they CAN'T on bitcoin. They have good ideas but literally cannot use the same infrastructure no matter how good it is because GAVIN IS SCARED of messing something up. Bitcoin's assets under management are beyond his level of risk tolerance.
Dismissing the routes other blockchains are taking simply holds back discussion of furthering all of this technology.
(this isn't unique to bitcoin, vertcoin or whomever also wouldn't want to hear about a potentially more attractive solution)
Ultimately, I mention Monero because there are things to be learned from it. Its about getting people thinking "hmm lets look at the pros/cons of stealth addresses and ring signatures and see how we use get that utility into the existing infrastructure"
right now the only way to check that out in action is a link to a monero blockchain transaction, take the downvotes in the process, and get a few more people recognizing the utility and thinking about it every time.

Sure, for one that isn't how the commerce clause of the federal constitution works.
Someone outside of the state that is damaged/effected by NY state law could argue (in federal court) that NY has no jurisdiction
Someone that does business with NY customers will have to comply with this law.
Keep in mind, states generally do not have a way, or the resources, to enforce their laws outside of their states. The legislature is free to pass anything.
Back to the commerce clause, that is just to allow the Federal government to regulate interstate commerce *if it feels like it* (by its legislature passing its own new laws), it doesn't prevent states from trying their own regulations that might also affect commerce outside of their state

because zerocoin's accumulator is a native network wide mixer and balances aren't even known by the network, just the end users. Also, the I2P implementation in anoncoin will keep your IP out of the network as well. The difference is that coinjoin needs providers, whereas zerocoin will be network wide (in some aspects they are similar, as I believe anoncoin will have "zerocoin" features in its own tab in the -QT client), but the blockchain with a coinjoin and coinswap implementation will still be available for parsing balances.

bcoind, the concept of "pull requests" is what most open source projects do to evaluate each and every contribution.
instead of somoene simply contributing any arbitrary change to an existing original project, they instead make a pull request, containing their change and the admins of the original project evaluate that change and decide to add it or not add it.
The public can see all pull requests as well as the one that actually make into the original project.
The public can even advocate for pull requests that may not have been understood by the original project admins. Understood can mean that its either esoteric, or that the utility of it is not immediately obvious
There are the checks and balances in the "git" protocol. which is what the bitcoin project uses.

Bitstamp nor Coinbase are unlawful internet gambling websites. They let people buy assets that do not expire, they do not let people trade binary options, they do not let people trade contracts for difference.
Coinbase is an american company, Bitstamp is not. Relevant to my next observation:
An offshore broker-dealer would also not come under this kind of scrutiny from a bank or be subject to this ambiguous rationale.
Since banks are INCAPABLE of determining what a bitcoin exchange's status is, and you feel like this wouldn't even be changed if those exchanges became registered broker dealers, then perhaps equal enforcement is impossible.

Maybe its simpler than I imagine and everyone is following regulations -snicker-  but its just an extra dimension I haven't been wanting to deal with.

Bitcoin's upcoming advantages in the capital markets will cause waaay more inflows into the bitcoin economy than anything consumer/merchant adoption could do.
a) Your friends are not a representative sample of how bitcoin is used.
b) You can give people bitcoin by knowing an address that they control. It isn't necessary to pull up a QR code and connect to the internet to receive transactions. The fact that Apple won't let them have an app to create addresses amongst other bitcoin related things is just an excuse.

I've read those reports, thanks for citing them. Yes, Suspicious Activity Reports are largely discretionary with some mandatory reporting aspects. 
The madrid bombings cost about $10,000 and the 7/7 london bombings cost maybe 500 pound sterlings. For reference, I consider $400,000 an insanely low number, given the breadth and intricacy of the regulatory framework and energy put into stopping terrorist financing. That's what.... 3 days of smuggled cocaine on the streets and 20 minutes at HSBC? There is no boogeyman trying to transact millions in diamonds across continents, my point (if not obvious) is that the approach to preventing social ills with AML is ineffective.
Regarding point 3, I consider these things expansions of a morally ambiguous legislation of "money laundering". I think they are good tools to reaching convictions where other laws fall short, in relation to proving fraud/wrong doing in different industries, but they are a WIDE WIDE net cast amongst all citizens and people trying to do any kind of commerce, effectively stigmatizing cash and personal possession, which every subsequent administration can expand to include another group, I've seen several bills fail in committee with new made up adjectives of new criminals.
Regarding point 2 and 4, I've read enough appeals court rulings related to SARs that led to money laundering and structuring convictions to know that what those transaction monitoring systems flag is very VERY subjective, and I have no confidence in them flagging terrorist financing. Yes, they catch middle easterners, yes, they catch minorities, but its things like landlords being sued by a tenant where said landlord then tries to move his cash away from potential liability in chunks eventually getting a SAR and found guilty of structuring. And of course, when one single financial institution launders 7 billion over a decade and still has that money "clean" in the financial system past all the SARS/AML/KYC/CIP firewalls and enforcement agencies, it really undermines all efforts to prevent that and subjecting everyone else to arduous capital controls/monitoring.
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:54:59
so first you do need to have an account with SecondMarket
this isn't a login/signup thing, just having information on file with them for KYC stuff, can be done through email with a person there, they move really quick, no bullshit
It is an OTC trade, you can negotiate prices. I try to get a price that is basically better than Coinbase where you have to deal with
a) Coinbase's spread, which is not bad these days
b) a 1% fee
c) 3-4 business days of money in limbo
SecondMarket uses wire transfers which can actually appear in your bank account in just a few hours, and cost ~$25 which is way less than 1% at these amounts. Despite the bitcoin community's ad nauseam criticisms of financial system's costs, these are only problems for specific socioeconomic classes of people.

@_date: 2015-05-29 02:40:34
I used to think like this


But this is not impossible.
As an illustrative analogy, there are a quadrillion in nominal value of derivatives, and many of these derivatives are redundant claims to the exact same assets. The value of derivatives is greater than the GDP of all nations, the M2 money supply, the actual money supply, and all assets on the face of the planet. This is completely decoupled, and has nothing to do with individual's ability to transact in these derivatives or make a quick buck in trading a contract made out of thin air. Nothing about the blockchain changes this, although some aspects can be mitigated with the open ledger, people can still make esoteric contracts to represent centralized assets that nobody can audit.
Regarding double spending, I think this is an odd argument. Bitcoin is not impervious to double spending. Someone with control over the network can do a limited amount of things to temporarily debilitate the network. This should not be controversial nor are there adequate checks and balances to prevent this from happening. Individual people have had over 95% of the network's hashing power before. 
If you disagree with my assertion just find a different or better argument.

For example, StorjX is a Counterparty asset, and trades on exchanges like Poloniex, despite being tradable directly on the blockchain. Because Poloniex is more liquid and faster to move between people, as no confirmations are required.
Centralized exchanges can trade assets for dollars, just like they can trade assets for bitcoin.
If you want to transfer that asset to your own private cold storage, you will pay the miners fee and thats it.
Most people here have their coins in Bitfinex and Coinbase, so it would be disengenious to imagine people are going to take an even greater step of securing their blockchain stocks and bonds in a counterparty or colored coin compatible offline wallet.
If you want to buy that asset using bitcoin instead of USD, then you will have to go find someone willing to sell. The Exchange itself may or may not facilitate this.
NASDAQ will not be transacting in bitcoin. They actually will be using bitcoin's blockchain. They CAN open a bitcoin : ACME colored coin shares market, they CAN open a USD : ACME colored coin market. Their users have fiat currency.
There is nothing about NASDAQ and other companies using the open assets protocol that even IMPLIES that somebody else in the future will have to pay more to buy a bitcoin.
It actually implies that there is LESS NEED for investment to go into the bitcoin currency, because it will be diluted by the LARGE existing holders of US Dollars moving into infinitely created colored coin assets. The proof of existences can be on the blockchain, transfers of assets can be on the blockchain, but the miners fee does not make bitcoin more scarce at all as the pools just redistribute it to existing holders.
Bitcoin's exchange rate is based on future growth and future scarcity, which I argue is based on a misunderstanding of the technologies available.

1. given for free and then 
2. backed by a fund that is started after the installation material is sold.
too bad that doesn't make any economic sense.
So lets analyze this, the tokens represent shares of the future value of the installation. The installation is sold and all the proceeds to go one central entity, the tokens represent ???What percent??? of this central entity? 
The tokens can be converted into cash from this central entity? Are all the bitcoin addresses holding the counterparty tokens given a proportional amount of bitcoin as a dividend?
The percentage of the installation material sell value that all of the issued token together represent is a necessary piece for me to continue criticizing and backing my assertion.
Assuming this part isn't completely arbitrary (and I've seen some arbitrary stuff in the crypto-equity space), what contract dictates this percentage.
Is FoamSpace aiming for intrastate exemption from the SEC? Or perhaps a Reg A+ exemption from the new regulations? Or were regulations not thought about at all, because people have done what FoamSpace intends to do way back in 2012 and 2013 before the federal government shut it down. There is nothing decentralized about what FoamSpace is offering that prevents this.

Except it won't have to be.
Right now what you say is true because of the opinion about future value being greater than it is now. Why is that you ask? Because people expect bitcoin to be more scarce because they attract capital away from the legacy financial system and fiat.
When it becomes obvious that bitcoin's don't have to be more scarce the future value will go down.
My observation is that bitcoins will NOT attract capital due to these new services adding confidence to bitcoin, because these services will attract confidence directly to them.
When a $3 billion company like Uber trades on Nasdaq's private company market using colored coins, NONE of that 3 billion will go into bitcoin except the 1/100,000,000th satoshi that gets burned when a colored coin transaction gets confirmed.
If the bitcoin network was handling 100 million transactions per day from these trades, then you could see that 1 bitcoin was being burned a day, and that it would only take 5-10 million days for this to start being reflected in the scarcity of bitcoin. But as it stands, even that ridiculous scenario is not going to pan out.
All the contracts, bonds, stocks and everything are just going to be confirmed on bitcoin's network but issued or denominated in colored coins.
Once the market realizes this, the added use value of these services will be reflected in the price of bitcoin.
There are other things which can raise the value of a bitcoin, but I am trying to calculate the satoshi burn rate.

I don't know why you stop at 20-60 years. If you are living off dividends then you have never touched your capital. That means you still have hundreds of thousands or the same million you started with, at the end of 60 years!

you have to use their UI to be able to hypothesize a better conclusion
basically the use case is: you go to a website that has square up for purchase/in store pickup/delivery. in the checkout process bitcoin may appear but "is unavailable for in store pickup". With in store pickup, the purchaser checks out, then goes over to the store themselves to retrieve the item. There is other user information such as name and phone number to support getting the goods in person.
in your scenario, the same person with spotty 3G/4G still has the opportunity to pay with a credit card in the website portal

That aside, the Hester Street fair in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan all summer accepted bitcoin with a number of vendors, and xCubicle was right across the street from that and has accepted bitcoin for years and I believe another bitcoin accepting business was there as well. It really felt like a bitcoin accepting district.
There is also the bitcoin center on Wall Street &amp; Broad Street. I really don't believe any other city has these things.
So, it is cringeworthy watching reporters do no research and try to go in cold turkey to prove or disprove a point.
The point is to stay liquid, if you needed cocaine laced government notes you would have converted bitcoin TO cash at that ATM.
Bitcoin could be integrated into Apply Pay or at the credit card level as a means of settlement between institutions. It can also be used directly by consumers. It is the most flexible of all these payment protocols and will still dramatically lower costs of all these systems without needing approval of Congress or a regulator.

so lets say you made a trade, cash to btc, and btc's exchange rate hit your price target and you exited that trade back into fiat, so you could wait for a better re-entry price into bitcoin to make a new trade, but you chose bitstamp because it was more liquid. Even though this was just a daytrade or whatever and even if you had no intention of it being funds that you would wire back to america (as opposed transferring smewhere else in bitcoin, like to coinbase) , if the FIAT amount was greater than $10,000 on any of those trades, and the FIAT was in an account not in america, then you would have to file the FBAR.

Like a week ago someone from Croatia tried to open a bank account for a bitcoin business with Bitstamp's bank, and was specifically denied due to having anything to do with bitcoin. The bank was chosen because it worked with bitstamp.
Maximum irony achieved. The point being they could pull the plug on Bitstamp at any time, and I think this is a greater and more likely 'systemic risk' to bitcoin['s price] than BTC-E.
But bitcoin has the same utility for me at $1 as it does at $10,000

Nope, the permissions feature set is simply a collection of uses-features and they are all set to required.
the uses-feature allows one to ask for permission for hardware access and denote if it required or not. Only if required is true will Google Play filter it in results.
When trying to access a non-required feature within the code itself, if you don't do a hardware check then the app will crash.

Can you guys go court registered agents? There are only 4 big ones across the united states and they could REALLY benefit from accepting bitcoin
especially since the most favorable states for incorporating a business are not places where many people actually live, so that problem of being remote + necessity of using a credit card and inconvenience of a money order makes it difficult for many US citizens and people worldwide to incorporate a business in a reputable jurisdiction to further attract investment!

a) bitcoin allows high schoolers and younger more freedom to make online purchases since there is a lack of access to credit/debit cards at that age. So it makes sense the information will spread in that crowd
b) protip: community college classes are a ton easier than AP classes, and the credits transfer pretty well too even if you got as low as "C" whereas AP courses are stressful, have way more work (essays + long assignments every class) and they only transfer to places if you get a "4" or a "5" otherwise you forget about it. You can take college classes over summer and winter break, multiple ones, without it being stressful.
Example: American History AP class is considered extremely hard, American History in college would be considered an extremely easy elective and people would laugh at you if you were taking it seriously (and not because all other college classes are proportionally harder, they aren't. AP History and AP classes are harder than  most college classes)

It is the DEGREE of scarcity and future scarcity that promotes the exchange rate.
I specifically said "more scarce". When perception of future scarcity decreases so does the exchange rate, nothing that these added services do will attract capital into bitcoin, due to the way these services are structured.
Satoshi and others recognized the potential use of the blockchain for stocks, bonds and other standardized contracts, but they didn't have the protocols for the Open Assets. Now it is more apparent that the bitcoin unit itself won't be attracting capital because it isn't necessary. Everything can just be pegged to satoshis, which there are **100,000,000** of in a single bitcoin. It should be obvious that nobody needs to be 1 in 21 million by owning one bitcoin.
If exchange rate decreases, the transaction fee discussion will adjust downward as well. 
There are plenty of opportunities for the exchange rate to increase because of 'confidence', 'halving', velocity of money flowing through bitcoin. 
But there are other reasons for it not to.

nothing would indicate that.
you can only infer that OP has "not enough" income to cover the asset purchase
if borrowed, not enough means that there are interest payments, and if bitcoin actually fails then OP will never be able to pay off the borrowed funds. There could be no income, as that is also not enough.
if not borrowed, then OP has no income whatsoever and no means of getting income, and should be homeless or simply sell some bitcoin for daily obligations. this is much MUCH less likely than the former scenario.

I still have questions
How does one prove ownership of the visual work?
My initial thought is that this protects against derivative works because a derivative work would have been created after the registration of the original work
So someone can't just screenshot or change a bit and get an incorrect hash, because your work has the real hash at an earlier date
but what if I lose the file or project? what if I need to resave an image from a photoshop document or RAW file, what if I can't recreate the entire workflow or process, what if I need to make a new scan or photograph of the work
all of these works will also get a different hash then and ownership in the blockchain will mean nothing if there is no digital file that can get the same hash

Thank you for proving my point.
Regarding risk analysis, other assets like options expire worthless if you are not correct in the market move, emphasis on expire. Underlying assets like bitcoin do not expire, they continue in perpetuity. This is less risky than an asset that expires.

honestly, bitcoin got me used to sending wire transfers (instead of 3-5 day ACH transfers)

Okay, a less snarky answer to your common rebuttal:
In the United States, the legislature has crafted strong laws to protect trade secrets. The executive branch has been working really hard to undermine that, financial activity is a trade secret
if you don't have trade secrets, you aren't really participating in the united states, so I can understand how that might not be relatable to some

Given enough time? Let me guess you always learn from the school of hard knocks?
There is absolutely nothing good about GBTC for the bitcoin asset. GBTC has nothing to do with bitcoin. The only thing "cool" about GBTC is that a bitcoin related instrument has made it's way into the American capital markets. It is "cool" that blockchain based public and private key cryptography has made it this far! GBTC is **not capable** of being the capital capturing vehicle that you want it to be.

aside from the fact that this isn't supposed to happen! it undermines credibility, it undermines the information available on configuration wikis, elaborate on what is going on. Good sites (not marketplaces) in darknet are still up, and I admit I don't know that many addresses, not that are there many websites (on clearnet or darknet) that I visit

people with larger amounts wait for ORDERS to pile up on the order book, and then fill them all. If they did this any other time, then the price would move more than they desire, meaning that they will spend too much or make too little from their buying or selling respectively.

Mixers are cool, but mixers use bitcoin, and bitcoin confirmations are slow. you also have to trust the owner not to steal your funds, and that their systems haven't been compromised by an adversary, such as the FBI (which has impunity to hack any computer, anywhere in the world, without reason), or the NSA
Use anonymous altcoins, they all have faster confirmation times. Monero with a high mixins is currently the best due to ring signatures + stealth addresses

No your perspective is questionable. As you probably already noticed in your inbox, analogies involve comparing unrelated things with similarities.

good question, so nobody really knows the extend of coinbase's gambling fund sanctions and we were all equally surprised that they were even trying to detect this thing. Forms of coin validation are likely to become more prevalent. the point being that this was ONE use case, and something people could probably relate more to than, I dunno, money laundering drug proceeds.
the mixing site could also have been seized and/or being operated by an authority, or be illegitimate and take your funds, or have a high markup. And bitcoin confirmation times are the slowest in the industry, regardless of the security discussion around that.
now for the answer about unlinking transactions, not about obfuscating the origin of a gambling website so that a financial intermediary doesn't freak out:
exchanging a coin between several exchanges simply has the trail of funds. And even if that particular exchange pulled out different coins from their treasury for withdrawal, that exchange has records of both the to and from. Sending those withdrawn coins to another exchange, still has the link now from the last place. If that exchange was also compromised as funds were being followed by authorities, then they would link that address  with and then also see where those funds were being withdrawn to. Even with the user changing addresses in their exchange's account for each deposit, it simply would slow down authorities once they figure out funds are going to an exchange's address.

a $10,000 bitcoin means the project would have a $200 billion valuation, where the price of a single bitcoin is determined by less than 5% of bitcoin that is available for trade on an exchange
so 10-20 billion moving into an exchange to acquire bitcoin would support that
scenarios that support it include merely an expanded audience, such as producers that currently reside in the futures market. or a larger audience of existing users, ie capital flight in one country really taking off. 
expanded use of metalayers such as counterparty and OMNI, where bitcoin is a necessary ingredient to use them
expanded use of bitcoin to access other markets priced in bitcoin
expanded use of shapeshift, where capital flows into other networks and vice versa
and let alone developments on the actual bitcoin protocol itself

Out of curiosity - this isn't criticism, even though it will sound like it - I just want to know your opinion on it.
Did you intend to be at least 42 years old and have a bachelor pad(s) and girlfriend, distinct from a family, wife and children?
You say retire, but would that support the accommodations that other people assume to have by the time they retire, and the rites of passage they commonly crowd toward? Such as children and education for those children.
Its great that you are able to sustain *yourself* living within your means. That is something a lot of people strive toward, as a bare minimum, and also never reach.
You sound proud about the realization you could live on $4,000/yr but I'm having a hard time seeing that as a bragging point. I'm glad you were able to experience excesses while young to realize that you didn't need them. But without context of what you're aiming for now, I seem to miss some of the value of what you are striving toward or doing now.

there will be a hard fork, so yes, core is not helping, because this is the one thing they want to avoid. after the network successfully switches and deals with forks on its own, THEN we will see how hard some egos were, as it would be the opportunity to continue development on the used client, or a fork of that client.
I don't think there is anything wrong with bowing out or abstaining from hard fork moments. I certainly won't be transacting during that time.

The delay is a technical one, yes. Blockchain settlement will disintermediate the technical issues financial institutions currently deal with. KYC and AML regulations can be automated on those systems just like how blockchain based financial institutions already operate (see Coinbase, which sometimes does have a delay in broadcasting and settling transactions due to the aforementioned KYC and AML).
Intranet blockchains don't use bitcoin, which is what the majority of the post was about. But as bandwidth improves institutions can use bitcoin, or something secured by the hashing power of bitcoin.
The bitcoin exchanges that lost millions and millions didn't use multisig, didn't have insurance, didn't have any safeguards really.

also I would like to add that many indymac people were not in FDIC insured products at all
as this made national news, many people across the double checked the kinds of accounts they had and switched to insured ones
think of it like when all the nodes in the bitcoin network detect a bad node or bad actor, they all invalidate that bad actor's behavior.
the US system adapted very quickly, and we were able to avoid a lot of worse issues. (the FDIC was successful but it was a very very fragile relationship, the FDIC's credit line to the treasury is only 60 billion, one actually big bank really failing with no other entity to sell it to would bankrupt the FDIC while paralyzing the entire financial system and all depositors would lose their money. Congress has since increased the number and kinds of financial products available for FDIC insurance, without adequately increasing the solvency of the FDIC)

Actually, with Nasdaq remaining a trusted third party, they can simply move the private keys between accounts and you have to trust that they won't steal your money, like you currently do, because they have a reputation for not stealing client's money.

One time I started two threads on bitcointalk looking for developers. Same thread, different subforums.
One thread got quickly derailed by people talking about how NDAs are too statist, and can't be enforced, and what kind of developer would sign that. Seriously, that was the consensus.
The other thread had a few people interested and it was a decent discussion.
I got a few private messages about the project in any case.

A lot of people are building on it. There are a metric ton of assets on decentralized exchanges.
Most people don't know and the censorship of this sub would dismiss certain assets of altcoins even if they were actually bitcoin assets.
For example, Storj is built on bitcoin's blockchain (a currency for cloud storage), and it trades on exchanges as SJCX. People just trade the SJCX/BTC markets like any other altcoin and have no idea what it does and is for.

convert to a cryptonote coin like Monero to unlink your transaction
bitcoin -&gt; TOR create new account on exchange -&gt; transfer btc to exchange -&gt; buy Monero with btc -&gt; send Monero to another address you control (this transaction is not linked to the previous transaction because that is how cryptonote works) -&gt; still in TOR create a new account on a different exchange -&gt; sell Monero for btc (assuming you actually want bitcoin still) -&gt; transfer bitcoin to your new wallet

the network has literally FORKED before, the network has been plagued by transaction malleability before, and TODAY we have a backlog of transactions.

You can create payments from the government for operating losses this year, against tax payments in previous years. If the government still doesn't have enough to pay you then you can carry forward the loss into the next years.
You can create deductions from money you borrowed, similar to the operating loss, to buy goods and services related to a for profit endeavor. Against properly withheld taxable income the same year.

you don't need a connection or ubiquitous internet to use receive bitcoin, or even transact. Eventually the transaction has to be broadcast to the internet, eventually. A merchant could do it. A vending machine could do it. Or all transactions can be hand delivered to the internet cafe across town at the end of the week. 
So the rebuttal isn't about using SMS in places with spotty service or underdeveloped infrastructure, the rebuttal is simply that you are wrong.

everyone in bitcoin is comfortable with bitcoin because they know errors only result in temporary disruptions. your holdings are fine and avoid transacting during those times.

Okay, I'm 7 minutes in and the host is badgering her about her health care idea with the openness of blockchain technology, a total red herring to implementing records on the blockchain. Nobody should have the answer to the implementation details and these aren't even the primary issues with implementing what she is talking about
A few years ago I had my patent attorneys look into the practicality of a similar thing. Primarily someone would have a digital signature on the blockchain that linked to more verbose [health] records, just like Factom does. The project was a non-starter for reasons that had nothing to do with security, primarily storage space.
It sounds like the host has already made an opinion about her. I think she's articulate enough by this point in time.

I had just looked at the last several full blocks to see how many transactions were fitting inside 999 kilobytes.


The difficulty would immediately adjust upwards if that happened. Putting you right back at square one.
Yes, several variables. Both Segwit and larger blocks are helpful. Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited scales past 2 MB blocks. So its not the bandaid people once were talking about.
I mentioned on btc that since Bitcoin Classic and BU only need 51% , and Segwit needs 95%, that they should also signal for Segwit because they'll draw hashrate away easier before getting to Segwit even if they don't adopt it. At the VERY LEAST as a trojan horse, but that the cards are basically in their hands to end the stalemate.

It stops at $6.00. I already ran the numbers. A full block (~1700 transactions) where the transaction fees also equal the block reward. a 25 bitcoin block, with even more transactions in the mempool.
block reward of 12.5 BTC, divided by 1700 TX, multiplied by today's exchange rate of $900
@_date: 2017-01-19 07:01:04
If they require 3 confirmations like most businesses, then it can take that long for 3 blocks to be found. It is just variance.
The average block confirmation time is 10 minutes. But this can result in a few blocks in few seconds and a few blocks over 2 hours in most extreme scenarios.
According to headlines, Alphabay also accepts Monero, and Monero's block confirmation time is 2 minutes. Monero can be bought directly from Kraken,  or you can exchange your btc for it in a multitude of other exchanges like Poloniex.

The competition will lead to interesting solutions. First, they make their intranet. You, the American consumer, notice your transfers between bank accounts suddenly start taking less than 3 business days (you might already notice this today). Free same-day services available for qualified customers. Then 10 minute transfers available. Then instant.
Different banking groups will have different exchange partners. Other banking groups will somehow be able to do this while spending less and less on IT security. "Are they not needing to protect their blockchain intranet?" Turns out that group is using an already secure blockchain, on bitcoin.
The disintermediation is happening.

I already pointed out that many miners have low margins and many mine at a loss. So this isn't exactly what I would consider a rebuttal?
Basically it is a simple calculation, the AMOUNT of bitcoin needed to buy your miners, will never be recuperated. You mentioned your miners were $2100? Okay, so that is 2.29 bitcoin at todays exchange rate of $916. Your miners will never make you 2.29 bitcoin, no matter what the exchange rate is (unless difficulty drops dramatically and nobody else sees that as an opportunity to turn their old miners back on).
Now sure, you can keep your miners on, and earn .001 bitcoin at a $10,000 exchange rate and feel good, because you have no overhead.
But you could have also just kept disregarding the excess energy, and simply bought 2.29 bitcoin, and had a greater profit in the event the exchange rate goes up.
I'm just pointing this out, not criticizing. I just want to make sure you are aware of *why* other people don't do this or talk about their bad business models. Many people are very altruistic for the network or have other goals for mining at a loss.

Ok sure I have a moment. First of all, the gold etf took forever to get approved. So to use that as an exhibit for why the bitcoin one should be approved "by now" is naive at best.
Secondly, some institutions side step the SEC. So if Direxion or Vanguard wanted to launch the bitcoin etf by now they could likely do it in 12 weeks or less. Think of it like getting level 3 clearance with Coinbase the first time vs already having it.
Thirdly, the SEC isn't tasked by Congress to evaluate the merits of investments, but as the gatekeeper to ETF approval - a financial product that exists from a modification/interpretation of the Investment Act of 1940 - the SEC has found itself evaluating actual investments. Congress specifically made the SEC to not tie up markets like this, and only promote the existence of disclaimers, for new and existing financial products that it has jurisdiction over, but here we are: the SEC is tieing up markets for a reason it is not actually equipped for.
Basically the Winklevii are nobodies and that's the only reason we don't have a bitcoin etf

Bitcoin bubbles occur under limited and stressed supply.
There are ample sellers for the demand at this price. Has Coinbase run out of bitcoin to sell yet? Has their delay become two weeks long yet?
Okay, then there won't be a squeeze yet.
Bitcoin rallies begin after they breached previous highs, which this has not done yet.


Which will occur when bitcoin shoots up $1,000USD in a day.
My main point is that your conclusion is based on the abscence of knowing anything, just like anybody here that is super bullish, super bearish, or super bored but mildly entertained by the renewed media interest.

You don't have to wait 10 minutes.
Plenty of services have enough confidence that their transactions will make it into the next block such that they allow for instant 0-confirmation transactions.
The network knows about transactions immediately, being included in a block just means it cant change.
It is a business choice.
Many businesses make you wait for 3 confirmations.
Hft? Most transactions happen in offchain databases. There are plenty of hft on the exchanges. I think that was bloomberg talking about hft in bitcoin yesterday.

Yes I have mined, and your conclusion is a non sequitur.
You are acting like someone that hasn't mined before, you actually didn't answer that. Plenty of people mine with low margins or at a loss, but they know they are, and like to support the network or hold bitcoin for greater price appreciation. You don't seem to know, but will also mine at a loss greater than simply buying bitcoins instead of the miners. 
What you are doing is a great way to support the network, and a nice use of otherwise wasted energy, but your idea of it being a wonder that nobody ever thought of it, as if it was an actually great original entrepreneurial idea, is just misguided. Because as a business plan, it is horrible.

The target block time is 10 minutes.
All miners are competing to find blocks before all the other miners. This ultimately means a new miner has to have a faster/more efficient computer than other miners to find blocks faster. To do this it means their more efficient computer is adding more hash power to the network. More hash power and blocks are found faster, most likely to the new miner with the most hash power. Ok, getting redundant, still with me? This also means the blocks are being found faster than the 10 minute block target time. The network evaluates the amount of hash power (every 2016 blocks in bitcoin) on the network adjusts the difficulty so that new blocks will then continue to be found in the 10 minute block target time.
And thats how block target time stays 10 minutes no matter what the difficulty does.
Difficulty can also go down if the hash power is lower than at the beginning of the last 2016 block round. Before this happens it means that blocks were taking longer than the average 10 minutes to be found, until difficulty readjusts lower bringing average block time back to 10 minutes.

All tax compliance is voluntary
It is only coincidence that the IRS (read: or any accounting or tax authority) is able to leverage banking companies for a paper trail. This additional view into the finances of people and businesses helps promote further voluntary compliance, the IRS doesnt immediately pull any money out of peoples accounts at tax time. They have sanctions for noncompliance.
So bitcoin doesnt remove tax liability. Just like cash didnt remove tax liability. The action of reporting was always voluntary, so your question is a loaded question because it presupposes a regulatory environment that never existed.
If you relied on employers and banks witholding and reporting payments for you, then there were greater consequences for you not making equivalent reports to the IRS. This was in exchange for convenience.

You're not educating me, I'm actually attempting to be a moderator here. Bitcoin has been in somewhat of a stalemate on this topic for about two years. You act like it is empowering for you to be a prick instead of articulating a rebuttal, because you feel it is obvious. There are compelling arguments that support other conflicting proposals, regardless of the fundamental truths you feel adamant about.
This is a multi-pronged conversation and you haven't added much to one of the prongs. You say "change the subject" I can easily say "avoiding the question" this isn't getting anyone anywhere. 
The rbtc guys would just as easily answer why they dont like segwit and completely avoid the block size bandwidth problem while trying to drill into my head why I would ever have an informed opinion about segwit at all.

The fee market that forms means that people can turn on their otherwise worthless miners again and earn an unpredictable sum of bitcoin from the transaction fees alone.
Currently, you can predict how much you'll make in bitcoin by the block reward because transaction fees in the blocks were almost negligible. But now transaction fees per block are already over 1 bitcoin. Transaction fees are expected to match and exceed the block reward consistently at some point in bitcoin's lifecycle.
Some people don't mind that happening now. Suggesting 12.5 bitcoin in transaction fees per block.
Others were thinking maybe this would happen after a few more halvings when the block reward itself was already down to 1 bitcoin per block.

so why couldn't this be included with a scaling block solution? the Bitcoin U plan isn't entirely irrational either. The block size can scale up and down in that plan


It does remove the fee market, to an extent. When periods when blocks are full and there is a backlog of transactions (like now), the first person to signal for and mine a 4mb block will get all those transactions and have a little bit of a windfall.
If more people want to use segwit and lightning anyway, then large blocks simply won't happen! There are a variety of choices and faster performing network!

@_date: 2017-01-20 00:23:01
I was aware of bitcoin in 2011 and research it for two years before I had confidence in it to hold any of it. Lots of questions, coupled with lots of criticisms from reputable people outside of the crypto-economy, as well as being in a different place financially half a decade ago, delayed my ability to dive in monetarily.
I watch incumbents go through the same mental exercise and come to the same conclusions as I eventually came to. That is the separation of cash and state. They all come to this conclusion unless they have a specific advantage in the incumbent system.
I see Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, releasing papers about regulating bitcoin - not because of drug markets, not because of AML/KYC or capacity of terrorist financing - but because he realizes this tool will cause his institution to lose control of the money supply. Because it is an exit. Exactly how the Chinese are using it.
Will you discover an inherent flaw in the entire concept that nobody else thought of? That the ECB didn't bother to write in their paper, something so remarkable that the ECB might as well have not even written the paper in 2016, 7 years into the bitcoin experiment which has had 100% uptime? GREAT, tell the developers of bitcoin and/or submit a patch! Problem solved and the network will be stronger.
Earlier adopters typically came to the same conclusion quicker. The confidence comes from the malleability of the concept. A lot of the understand comes from something as simple as buying a bitcoin, and sending a bitcoin across the network. The scarcity promotes economic incentives to improve the network, yes, that was an obtuse way of saying "make you rich", and this is a byproduct of its utility promoting further scarcity.

Thats a nice utility.
When I was mining, some pools did routinely get more orphaned blocks than others, and this was blamed on latency and also broadcasting a few hundred kilobyte sized blocks on slower connections. How is that reality also not part of what you just pointed out as well.
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:56:20
you shouldn't be expected to be able to upload 300 megabyte photos anywhere. its actually amazing the other ones allow it, it is bad infosec. Secondly, your phone/camera likely has a setting to create smaller normal sized image files. A normal size image is less than 1 megabyte.
@_date: 2017-01-18 08:17:51
Getting warmer.... but still quite a ways off.
So blocks never stop being generated. The block reward gradually goes away, it gets lower, and lower, and lower, until the transaction fees are the most lucrative incentive to mine a block.
This is part of the design to bootstrap the network, and was detailed in the white paper released in 2008. Despite the growing pains of opinions and experiences, the average consensus is completely in line with what the white paper predicted. That the transaction fees will overtake the block reward until there are only transaction fees.
Individuals pay a transaction fee for the specific purpose of being included in the next block. Get it?
Blocks come every 10 minutes in bitcoin, and that is the least likely aspect to change. All other variants of bitcoin (litecoin, monero, etc) have faster blocks.

@_date: 2017-01-25 08:27:56
did you realize that the scaling plan that is being adopted by two bitcoin clients allows for adjustable block sizes? Not "2MB" blocks?
Basically in the event of a transaction backlog (like now), the first person to raise their block limit, mine the backlogged transactions, AND propagates the block to the majority of the network gets a windfall in the fees. (this flexible rule set still requires 51% of the network to already agree with said rule set)
The next blocks won't be as big as the transactions in the mempool will be less. If there really were continuous transactions in the mempool then there will be bigger blocks and nodes will be incentivized to improve their latency to the rest of the network.
This can be further alleviated by segwit and the lightning network.
But they aren't mutually exclusive proposals.

Onboarding is way quicker than any of the exchanges and you dont have to worry about your inputs getting flagged. Transaction costs are way lower. It takes less time since there are less transfers: fiat is wired to otc which will send btc to whatever address you want even straight to an altcoin exchange if you desire. For selling btc is sent straight from your address to the otc address and you get fiat wired to your bank account. 
Many otc desks do altcoin-altcoin trades for you too.
Theyll make almost any market you ask for.
Its very fast.

Thats not the same as centralization. 500 kilobyte blocks would allow for even MORE nodes.
There already are people that can't relay a block in time. Before China had most of the miners, pools there would routinely get blocks orphaned because latency was too low.
It'll be okay. Larger blocks would have the capability of being orphaned if your connection isn't also great. Not all blocks would be large.

If you have the phrase, the wallet can be lost and destroyed and you experience zero loss, as the wallet can be recovered from thin air with the phrase.
If you lose the phrase and lost the wallet. Then your bitcoin are lost forever, and all other bitcoin holders will thank you for contributing to the further scarcity of bitcoin.
If someone else knows your phrase, then they can recreate your wallet also and take control of your bitcoin. (They will simply move them to another wallet, where they have likely taken the proper steps to secure their bitcoin)


Why do people still mention bitcoins having been lost forever when an exchange shuts down?
There are very simple and repeatable steps to properly secure your bitcoin. If you don't do them, then there are more vectors for unrecoverable loss.

Paper wallets have a legitimate purpose that has absolutely nothing to do with fiat. Not everyone has an extra computer laying around that doesn't need to be connected to the internet.

Well the acronym means “Over the Counter”, what it means in this context is a service that fills large orders at a prenegotiated price. These orders are not visible to the market and the other side of the trade is either the OTC desk’s own dark pool or another person that has the exact amount you want.
It lowers transaction costs and the market wont freak out when it sees your order, because it will never see.
The reputable OTC desks have a minimum trade size of $100,000
Less established ones and ones you have a relationship with will have a $25,000 minimum per trade. Some reputable friends will have arbitrarily lower minimums.
The fees can usually be negotiated to less than 1% of a pricing index. Like the XBX. In comparison, Coinbase’s retail service charges 1% AFTER giving you a random price. 
8 and 9-figure orders have much wider spreads, but usually tapping out at 5% in the most liquid crypto markets like bitcoin. Posting the order on an exchange will scare the market and you’ll end up getting 30% worse prices.

Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) series can be recovered at any location at any time. This is a technique used to generate wallets.
You can basically teleport your bitcoin anywhere on the planet with "HD wallets".
The user experience in most wallets is that they give you a randomly generated phrase of words, that you save or remember.
With this phrase of words, you can recreate all aspects of your bitcoin ownership on any computer (or on paper if you feel inclined). When connected to the internet, or merely synchronized with the blockchain as this is a file that can be moved around offline as well, you will see your latest balance. Offline you can also create transactions. So if you felt so inclined you could create a transaction and get someone with internet to broadcast it at a later date.

So first, you would need to find 1 billion worth of bitcoin to borrow. There isn't 1 billion worth of Bitcoin actually in circulation so there's that problem.
Oh but you mean Naked Shorts? Everyone would catch on. You can't short with bitcoin that doesn't exist. Or people would know that there are exchanges which have fake bitcoin on them with an unfathomable supply.
There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence.
If someone artificially suppressed the price, that means cheap bitcoins. So you are telling me that you wouldn't buy? Like if bitcoin traded for $10/coin right now, how long would it take for that gigantic sell order to get eaten? The money supply of bitcoin would be worth $100 million at that price and would get the attention of everyone in the market.
I'd say 2 days at best, and the rest of the market would bid bitcoin back up to what the aggregate thinks they are worth. $900 today.
The one market participant that had shorted bitcoin all the way down that low would now have an ever increasing loss, many multiples of the amount they shorted. And they would have to get that loss off their balance sheet because they would owe the people they borrowed from. They would owe the same amount of their asset back.

This got me thinking, how high do transaction fees currently need to be to equal the block reward? The white paper mentioned that the block reward would be supplanted by the fees.
Full blocks have an average of 2400 transactions in them. 12.5 bitcoin, divided by 2400 = .0052 btc , @ $900 exchange rate that is $4.68 per transaction.
Given the speed of bitcoin confirmations, this is still cheaper than what I pay for wire transfers, the only method I have that is a comparable speed for sending money to the most places. Debit card transactions are cheaper and faster though, and are credited to accounts instantly, while the actual settlement takes several business days and can be reversed.
At this block size, bitcoin doesn't seem to have that much of a value add in its most vocal proponent's primary use case. 
The assumptions in this analysis here are that there are only 2400 unconfirmed transactions at any given moment, and that nobody would bid higher to ensure being included in the next block.
Also assumes the exchange rate of $900, which...is not a stable thing to assume.
It is kind of cool to foresee a real way for transaction fees to supplant the block reward. A few years ago that was a completely pie in the sky notion.

HFT happens offchain.
Nobody wants or plans to do HFT on the blockchain itself. Almost every exchange where you buy bitcoin is offchain. Just like Forex brokers are offchain of fedwire. They have their own balances and private databases where they move those balances between users, and make those users jump through a bunch of hoops to actually withdraw anything over SWIFT, ACH, Wire, or SEPA. All of which are networks that have an actual capacity for processing transactions, just like bitcoin is a network for processing transactions.
Offchain HFT abides by the exact same rules as HFT in other capital markets.
So there's no way to really entertain the analysis you presented. Congratulations you're right? Nobody put that much thought into it, offchain trading is fine. HFT would currently be impractical on a decentralized exchange. But lightning network with a market in Tether could possibly enable HFT.

Have to start using exchanges like Kraken or Bitfinex as bank accounts with interval deposits, and then moving to bitcoin there when you want.
Circle was the only place with instant weekly limits at no charge (except marginally worse prices).
Coinbase was the next best but their instant was limited to like $300 a day, maybe $1,000, maybe with a 4% charge.
But Kraken/Bitfinex/Coinbase dollar deposits are your best bet for when an opportunity arises over the weekend and you need several thousand worth of bitcoin now.

What would be the correct way to denote that? If your business had to pay escrow fees, or pay for fees for a bunch of OP_RETURN transactions, they would be business expenses. It doesn't make a difference if you call it "technology" or "office" or "subscription" fees on the tax form even if the IRS came to your doorstep and said "could you clarify the adjective used in your business deduction form".
At issue here is the IRS thought the property designation meant bitcoin could only be used for capital gains and speculation on any of their tax forms. And are now launching a dragnet based on that assumption.

the IRS doesn't classify bitcoin as currency, because it is not able to unilaterally decide if something is a currency or not, especially when it is not issued by a sovereign nation. Only Congress has that power. So the IRS is limited in putting it in the property category.

@_date: 2016-12-27 23:40:00
If you bought at the last all time high, you would have sustained an upwards of 90% loss for two entire years, while everyone including your investment advisers laughed in your face about your risky "investment" and magic speculator money. You thought they would understand eventually, as you understand bitcoin enough to exchange your wealth in state-issued currency into cryptocurrency. In 2016, they still do not understand, despite you breaking even and turning a profit. Perhaps you bought more and more throughout those last two years at an 80% discount, providing you with much greater wealth than you would have started with in 2014. But what happens next? What supports your investment? Does the "you" from this alternate reality now feel like they should sell and enjoy their new wealth? Can the "you" from this alternate reality tolerate another 80-90% deterioration of wealth if the exchange rate drops to $200 until the year 2020? Or ???
Thats the answer to "is it too late now". Do you understand enough to support any investment thesis

Circle lets you buy bitcoin with a credit card. Not sure what their verification process is like these days.
The first time you opened a bank account did not take 5 minutes either. This is a parallel financial system. Nowadays some banks let you do sign up online pretty quickly, and offload the regulatory stuff to snail mail weeks later. So bitcoin providers should consider working on their user experience too, but since people typically want to acquire bitcoin from them and immediately move bitcoin away from them (as opposed to making a deposit, at a bank), I can see limitations here.
"Buying bitcoin" is a misnomer, these are tokens of programmable units to store data on a blockchain where it is coincidence that the market has placed a price on this capability.

I would be down for a "contentious fork". There are plenty of solution to make sure your transaction gets included on the right one. Like broadcasting it via vpn to areas more likely to have nodes on the "best" chain.
Even if a fragmented network was easier to 51% attack, your private keys would still be safe. Everything not broadcast would still be safe. It would be a temporary inconvenience until the network established itself more robustly and a great opportunity for you to scoop up some cheap coins.

I've been advocating for ledger agnostic technologies for a long time.
Currently these days if someone saw something they liked built on top of one cryptocurrency, they would have to completely rewrite it from scratch
This assumes having the knowledge, interest, and competence to do it. You couldn't discuss the idea of that technology on another cryptocurrency network with the people currently using it, and you couldn't discuss the other cryptocurrency's technology with the network you want to add it to, because all the crypto communities want to pretend like the others don't exist. This dilutes the crypto-friendly talent amongst counterproductive cliques, when they could be all helping each other.
The solution is for application level stuff to be created from the ground up as ledger agnostic. 99% of cryptocurrencies are direct forks of bitcoin. If the block reward was modified, that should be a software dependency, if the block size was modified that should also be a dependency, if your network is using masternodes, that should be a software dependency, etc. This makes it easier for application level code to tie into any network and pull in the necessary dependencies when applicable.

He was leaving Italy and going to England.
So this scenario would have involved having $420,000 in cash and needing to get it into bitcoin.
It was undeclared. He could have declared it but maybe there was a reason why he didn't want to declare it. In which case, OTC trades involving banks wouldn't have helped here either.
But if he COULD deposit it, then he COULD have also declared it. And If he could have deposited it into a bank/exchange, then he also could transferred or accessed it from the UK without bitcoin ever being involved.
Anyway, Genesis accepts buy orders straight from a bank account, and they accept sell orders straight from your bitcoin wallet. They are not a custodian of cash or bitcoin. But they will send you bitcoin or cash when they receive your cash or bitcoin, respectively.

Well Bitcoin isn't exactly new, Ebay has had a long relationship with virtual currency. They have cracked down on it, relaxed policies, changed policies completely, launched their own virtual currency store, closed said store, paypal's enabled limited bitcoin capabilities for merchants, paypal's spun off of ebay, etc etc
It is hard to keep up, but scammers still exist and customer service still has the worst policies

A good start but too verbose before getting to the actual bitcoin
I understand the idea of wanting to warn people *there be monsters out there*, but the slides themselves don't get to the point
and when it does get to the point, it doesn't get to the consequences such as "WHY is using Coinbase the bad way wrong"
It also talks about not putting much bitcoin in a phone wallet because the phone can be stolen, but then AFTER that talks about backups, which mitigates this whole problem. and this is after like 20 slides talking about 2fa. The phone can be stolen and bitcoin won't be lost, and it also won't be accessible by the thief, just load the backup on a computer or new phone.

There are many more litecoin in circulation than bitcoin. 30,000,000 more to be precise.
This means nothing ultimately, litecoin's market cap is $300,000,000, just another fact, because what you said made no sense
effective trading value is actually more than bitcoin's. The volume is much greater and the actual dollar amount traded is the same and has nearly surpassed btc's "effective" (actual) trading value.

hm I hadn't heard of this case till now
so elaborate, was he accused of selling bitcoin to individuals? I read the whole blog and skimmed the beginning of the indictment and all I saw were mentions of a business, a satellite office, a lack of business license which I am assuming is the money transmitter license the indictment mentions.
why was he unable to use exchanges, and why was he selling to individuals to sell high? You mentioned this was before the Florida Local bitcoin arrests, so this answers my own question. He was selling bitcoin to individuals in high dollar amounts.
how many bitcoin had he amassed? What are the addresses? How was he storing the bitcoin? what is it worth right now in the forfeiture proceedings?

So instead of a credit card company or bank requiring a subpoena to divulge information, or giving a significant other your banking statements, or pretending that the only option at all is making suspicious charges to a joint account
You instead want to use a permanent blockchain with public address hashes that everyone can see forever, under the assumption that it won't become user friendly enough to link transactions ever. Hoping your exchange never notices or cares either.
Okay. There are ways to do this to unlink your transaction. You COULD put cash in an bitcoin ATM and have unlinked bitcoin. You COULD just use the bitcoin to get local currency in the foreign country. You COULD do this domestically with cash. You COULD use a private blockchain like Monero (but nobody accepts it either). You COULD shapeshift Monero to a bitcoin address (this actually works really well).
But just buying bitcoin to pay an escort as if it is problem solved, that is disingenuous.

ShapeShift may retain information, and if they don't now, a court order or 3 letter agency could compel them, or they could just tap their Amazon server instance....
The way to use Shapeshift is to use TOR and Monero.
Basically already own some Monero, when you want to pay bitcoin addresses on the internet (or to your own account), you TOR it up, go to ShapeShift.io , and transfer the appropriate amount of Monero and ShapeShift will pay the associated Bitcoin address. Works with other cryptocurrencies to of course.
So whether you received a good or service, or whether you just sent a different currency to yourself, nobody will ever know.
BUT IF YOU USE ANY OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCY then the blockchain is public. Monero's blockchain, used correctly, does not glean any useful information. It is a private blockchain. Go over to if you want to know best practices of using Monero's privacy features. It is possible to inadvertently opt-out of the privacy, so you should know what you are doing. But this is distinct from bitcoin's lack of privacy and "opt-in" privacy features.

**USING BITCOIN FOR ANY CLEARNET ACTIVITIES IS GOING TO END WITH YOUR BANKING RELATIONSHIPS RESTRICTED** , as soon as someone decides they don't like one of your transactions.. which are public forever if you use bitcoin
The infrastructure isn't currently good for new people just yet. Coinbase can easily start blocking payments to Backpage addresses (if Backpage doesn't follow certain bitcoin best practices for anonymity), and it is not user friendly to use more opaque crypto currencies

Okay, well Monero has opt-in transparency features that you could leverage.
Transactions formed with the parameter mixin 0 are traceable. Using mixin 1 and mixin 2 also have a probability to leak information. The software clients are being updated to form transactions with mixin 3 and higher, and there is debate about making all nodes reject lower mixins (but they probably won't do this).
Also, users have the choice of exposing their "viewkey", which is similar to bitcoin's hash of a public address. The difference being that Monero viewkeys are not published in blockchain transactions. If you felt so compelled then this is something you could require, and you get to see the balance and transaction history of that viewkey address as if it was a bitcoin address. The user could just as easily create a new address just like with bitcoin, and you get to feel great about how you had the personal choice to attempt to find an illicit connection.
Regardless, I think you'll find the technology interesting. At least 3 Bitcoin-core developers have been working on Monero for 10 months.

You made racial claims that are unfounded, all you are doing is weakening this argument for where there are legitimate issues.
Almost all IRS structuring problems I've read deal with "white" people (whatever that means). Just because this one is with someone else does not mean the government is being racist.
The government is being equal opportunity in f'ing people over. And you are falling into the divide and conquer approach being used to keep people from doing anything about it.
Google Scholar? My search term wasn't "structuring laundering", that was the other guy, I didn't provide that source. Sorry.
When I am looking for cases I typically google specific laws by their USC title name, to see how they stand up in appeal's court. 
That aside, why does that bother you so much that I mentioned what I observed? This has nothing to do with the 'divide and conquer' designed for plebeians. In these exact words "the names of the defendant's (or the property owners) are often non-anglo saxon style names", why does it bother you that I mentioned that? It didn't say most, more frequently, disproportionate, I chose my words pretty carefully there. My observation isn't even about the government being racist, prejudiced, profiling, it would be about the discretion of bank tellers to file suspicious activity reports, where there would be a lack of oversight into the discretion around SARs where the government can choose to follow up on the SARs that they get.
Simultaneously, your observation about "most" of what you've read, would again easily ignore the possibility of disproportions (an assertion I wasn't even making, yet one you now choose to use as a rebuttal which fails for that reason).
My actual assertion is that this is just one thing to be aware of, especially if you are paranoid about prejudice against you, paranoid about 'fitting the description' or being perceived as suspicious. Cash is stigmatized.

I can answer one question:
Bitcoin is the separation of cash and state, in that it is a currency whose strength isn't a reflection of one's affinity to any government. 
It allows for digital worldwide payments without the need of a bank (although many bank like services now exist to make it easier to use). It can also be used between people next to you, the point is that it can be used by anyone.
Since it works faster than checks, bank transfers, wires, and is also cheaper to use, then some places (like the city of Troy) is looking into accepting it as a payment option. 
It is easily convertible to and from US dollars, so people are using the bitcoin infrastructure to move US dollar value very quickly, anywhere in the world, without getting banks involved.

Thats not true. My observations is that you are attempting to leverage anti-money laundering ideals based on the way they currently exist. 
I'm saying, step back for a moment and pretend they never existed.
Go back to the reality where nonstate enemy combatants still did exist, freedom fighters and terrorists expropriating resources finding ways to finance themselves in developing nations. Reintegrating the proceeds of their illicit activities into the broader economy.
Are you going to tell the banks, the nascent NASDAQ, the burgeoning  SWIFT platform to stop? Stop this high speed globalization capital flight program right now! Do you know the mayhem you are going to cause?
And they will simply tell you that you will have to develop your own legislative tools to prevent whatever activity you are trying to deter or are afraid of.
... While they keep building their gigantic world altering financial networks.
A smarter person in the legislative body found a way to leverage all of this newfangled "data and bits" these financial institutions were storing on their "punch cards", and created anti money laundering statutes that did help enforcement.
Since that tool is no longer applicable, someone ELSE in the legislative body will have to find another way to deter the behavior they disagree with. If each enforcement action is turning the next-gen financial network more and more private and untraceable at the software level, then that enforcement action isn't going to work. The legislative body will have to create different tools.

The IRS made this declaration that Bitcoin is property. The IRS has no authority to designate something as a foreign currency as the power rests with Congress.

There are a lot of other things you can do.
On mobile, many apps seem a lot faster and "snappier" than other apps simply because of buttons having tap states and the UI transitioning/animating/moving around, and a fade in on the next screen before anything is shown
Similarly, console games follow strict rules about how long loading screens can be, and offload loading in other places, like riding up an elevator or creating longer corridors
Here, trying to kill two birds with one stone isn't the best approach. "Generate keys, why not make the user do something else that is also necessary"
Try just dropping in a loading screen and make it look like pieces of the store are popping in as it loads.
(And some critique) The current onboarding process looks nothing like the actual store front, and nobody even knows what the storefront will look like. The very first impression is like the user accidentally landed on the mobile version of the website, as if this is a bug.

An analogy would be like how Donald Trumps "GDP" is not great, but him defaulting threatened the solvency of a financial institution, just because of the size of the loan the bank gave him.

The crime of money laundering was created in the 70s, 80s and 90s as a tool to cut off shadow economies and the benefits of illicit activity, it leverages the financial system.
Bitcoin doesn't use the financial system so those tools are not applicable.
Police and governments will have to create new tools. This is not our responsibility. Neither was it the banks which were created hundreds of years before. The actions which became criminalized also existed beforehand.

One thing I like to do is take profits from bets that have positive expected value and gamble some of them [on table games that have negative expected value].
For example, lets say I'm up 200% on a trade, and I've now closed the trade. I'll take 25% of the profits and gamble them to my hearts content on blackjack. I like bitzino.com
No profits? No gambles.
Easy for me. Lose all of that or gain another 100%. Sometimes I see if I can get 7 reds in a row, just keep doubling the principle until I eventually bust. I've never gotten 7 reds though, except when I was betting on black. Crazy!
It is the rush that is fun. Making profits in a fast market and immediately gambling some of the profits, and then using the proceeds from the gambles to diversify a portfolio into some other cryptocurrency or crypto-securities?

so blockchain analysis gives more ability to aml regulations than banks have with fiat currency.
in this very thread there is talk about how mixer services can result in exchanges blacklisting coins.
coinbase - which is already under aml directives - follows coins that have been to gambling sites at some point in time.
opaque blockchains like Monero remove the chain analysis perk, while retaining the benefits of a blockchain. actually removing capabilities of cryptocurreny exchanges and putting them on par with banks

a) Bitcoin isn't "free from that crap"
b) Smart routing does help facilitate high frequency trading, so I can see your concern
c) Centralized brokerages have nothing to do with the existence of high frequency trading, HFT relies on direct market access, of which brokers are not. 
d) HFT intercepts data that comes from brokers because they are not using direct market access 
e) All bitcoin exchanges are centralized brokerages.
f) All bitcoin exchanges have free data access, so this entire post and conversation is about if anyone has created a service other people can use that taps into this free data access on all the exchanges, which brings us back to point a)... rinse repeat.

You should look at all the structuring cases on Google Scholar case search, the names of the defendant's (or the property owners) are often non-anglo saxon style names
One case that is burned into my mind is one where a tenant injured themselves at their apartment and sued the landlord for millions of dollars. The landlord was afraid of loosing everything so they did move money out of their bank account at less than $10,000 increments to avoid the bank's reporting. The landlord thought that the tenant's lawyers would discover the money if the bank made reports of it (possible, but obviously not the only consequence as we will see, and doesn't prevent the lawyer/court from finding his assets). The landlord was found guilty of structuring because he did structure and was trying to avoid bank reporting, there was no ambiguity with the law there. The case with the tenant was settled for ~$30000 , the landlord had to go to federal prison and forfeit the withdrawn cash.
This law wasn't created to do this.

Okay, I've actually long noticed that Shapeshift functions the exact same as Liberty Reserve did.
Liberty Reserve converted all debits and credits into a zero knowledge cryptographic database for accounting (and then deleting said records). A little ahead of its time.
The only problem was that Liberty Reserve was a centralized service making it an easy target.
Shapeshift.io only difference is existing in 2015 and tying into existing decentralized cryptocurrency networks. It is a divergent evolution resulting in the same outcome.
This isn't a criticism, it just an observation. So for someone else to make this observation is more so validating that "hey someone else actually read Liberty Reserve's indictment too"
So, Shapeshift might want to consider leveraging more decentralized methods if possible. Before Janet at FinCEN changes her mind.

okay so people haven't really been telling you the full story about what to do with bitcoin.
your government has placed withdrawal limits on banks, closed the banks, and also disabled electronic bank transfers out of the country
as a european union citizen you are able to open a bank account in any eurozone country.
so you open a bank account in another country
buy bitcoin with the cash you have available right now, convert that bitcoin to back to euro on an online exchange
electronically send that euro back to the bank account in another euro country (or just keep the euro on the exchange)
the only way this is beneficial to you is because you currently can't sent money in a greek bank account to a bitcoin exchange (or to a different euro bank account)
so instead you can buy bitcoin with cash (if you can find a trader/bitcoin ATM), and transfer it anywhere, no matter what the greek government says.
this makes you immune to price fluctuations because you aren't in the bitcoin network for very long.
many people on the internet have implied that you would just hold bitcoin like an investment until it becomes the primary mode of commerce, but really you can just get bitcoin, transfer it to get around capital controls, and have euros in a different bank account
there are some remittances companies that do this without the customer knowing. Western Union currently doesn't use the bitcoin network, but other cheaper companies do. I don't know of any in Greece though so you just have to do the process manually, it isn't hard.

Several reasons, but for traders and investors subject to wash sale restrictions for tax purposes, you can sell one asset as a loss and buy a functionally identical asset with a different label and circumvent wash sale rules.
See tax loss harvesting.
There should be multiple ETFs in each jurisdiction. It would be ideal if they are holding the underlying asset, making it more scarce.

its not about the form factor, it is about the execution. In this case, other companies have little money to operate and their execution shows in terms of marketing and lack of ability to deliver. Eidoo, on the other hand, has already raised 24 million in a token sale, and is situated in a more mature regulatory environment in Switzerland. Whereas prior companies that may have also relocated to Switzerland used a lot of resources just figuring that part out, and helping create the favorable regulatory environment, while having less operating capital to begin with.

India apparently has a horrible tax collection rate, which they have recently been trying to improve. 
The idea of an authoritative government spending excess resources on tax compliance is a very limiting idea.
It isn't even a prerequisite for governments to have most of their revenues by a passive tax, and even if the above was all true, everywhere, it assumes the governments may not see other cost savings or additions to their economy with the technology.

I can but I feel like your healthy skepticism is done in a counterproductive way
for example, I think that once you learn about an exchange or two, you will create an argument about the merit of the service because it was nothing like a NYSE or online broker-dealer, instead of its place in history
I think you'll create an argument about the source of the information, instead of the accepted ramifications of the information
I could be wrong, but I think the main point is that people are still here because they see what the technology can do, and are open to helping it get there without being deterred by what isn't great right now, or in the past.

Although this news might get me to upgrade all my addresses.
Lets look at the user experience in two wallets desktop though:
Electrum - only gives the option of bech32 and lets you know something about it not being able to send to 1addresses anymore.
Ledger - hurray another unexpected decision tree. better stick with legacy.
I don't send THAT many payments, I just store value and can always store it in a bech32 address later.
Those are my thoughts.

Could have used a normal database for this. This is a hugely redundant way of making farmville credits.
The guy is tinkering with an idea of giving out coins for writing corporate articles or creating corporate software, this most likely means that this is a play thing controlled by one person (huge premine or one miner) and doled out as a central authority. Pointless.

Hey Bruce, have you considered dissolving it completely?  Not restructuring, not renaming, not removing founders... 
The bitcoin community is more greatly harmed by the Bitcoin Foundation's mere existence.
It has done what it needed to, and other people and organizations have taken the baton and done it better. The talks with public servants, parliaments, congress, senators are now being done by venture backed companies and core developers that are on a different payroll and more focused than the Bitcoin Foundation will ever be.
The research papers that come out from academia are way more comprehensive than the Bitcoin Foundation can ever do.
All other organizations in the Bitcoin space that produced failures simply dissolved and went away (well, often in very dramatic ways) and it is time for the Bitcoin Foundation to do the same thing. Six months from now all the new adopters will have never heard of it and it will be better.
Your thoughts?

Bitcoin didn't have to be recognized as money by any federal authority or court for this outcome to have been obvious.

You ask this question and then write your own answer without getting an answer to the question? 
The answer is that they are perceived as more valuable to the current crop of venture capitalists and bigger companies when they have users that seem more and more interested in their product. They are able to secure a larger funding round or seem a better candidate for a buyout. Why are they perceived this way? Because in the future they can run ads or upsell other offerings to a large userbase that actually uses their service and spends time in it.

Although I'm not familiar with the suicidal tendencies of those suffering from depression, Aaron didn't have to commit suicide. He had already achieved his public service announcement, and would have continued with the EFF on his side.
I consider his death to be in vain despite the heavy handed nature of MIT and the DOJ at the time.

You think you are so enlightened because of the statistical probability that nobody has been exposed to cryptocurrencies yet.
I'm telling you that shit doesn't work. Exchanges that don't provide proof of reserves aren't losing or failing to attract any meaningful customer base. Exchanges that begin to fail their proof of reserve experience no meaningful customer loss. Exchanges that have questionable finances and trade data don't have any consequences whatsoever.
So its the same as non-bitcoin exchanges.

It is hard to predict what people will find immediately valuable.
There was a power outtage that took out half of NYC, and what became valuable were power strips. Power strips were the currency, because the part of NYC that had power was filled with people wanting to charge their phones and other gadgets.
All the survivalists that found themselves deep into the apocalyptic powerless zone all had their spears, books, and treehouses, but I had way more resources because of my ability to trade for getting power.

Tech companies main value proposition is showing how active their users are, which means how much time they spend in the app or on the website, as opposed to generating any real value.
This is the upsell to future investors so they can secure their next funding round.
Making it frustrating for the actual user, actually did keep you in their app longer. 
With this much of a discrepancy in how long it took, you could even close your account and a mere fraction of their remaining users would still show better "engagement" numbers.
Remember, this is a world where Facebook conducted a 100 billion USD IPO by merely saying their users were worth $100 each yearly.
Hope that helps.

Your concept of short is incorrect or is incomplete.
Shorting doesn't mean selling what you own, sitting in cash, and waiting for a lower price with the intent of buying back in.
Shorting means BORROWING at a high price, and paying the person back at a low price. Specifically: 
1 - borrow (1 bitcoin)
2 - sell the borrowed asset at market price ($240/btc)
3 - wait for a lower price (you currently have $240 in your account if you did this with 1 bitcoin)
4 - buy the same asset back at a lower price (in this example bitcoin now trades for $25, so you buy 1 bitcoin for $25, this means you now have $215 in your account and 1 bitcoin)
5 - and the asset back to the person you borrowed from. (leaving you with a profit of $215)
the person that only sold and didnt short has a profit of $0, the person that never sold has a profit of -$215 - but to that person 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin lol, ultimately the person that went short has more money and can buy more things
yes, I am saying skysailer should short sell everything and make a huge profit, if Mt Gox coins came back onto the market.

Good to see liquidity for those of us that aren't here for micropayments and cheap transfers of said micropayments.
Paying a $25 wire fee on a $60,000 transaction is just as negligible as paying a .001 btc transaction fee. Takes just as long to go from OTC market to bank and vice versa, as it does with bitcoin. If your bank doesn't suck and you know the schedule.
And you don't have to worry about random compliance or security shit with the exchanges, since OTC exchangers don't hold your funds.

No, there have been stocks to trade in the bitcoin economy since 2012
The SEC (US Federal Government) shut down the biggest exchanges in late 2013 and cryptoequities have been in dire straits since
You could trade shares of companies on centralized exchanges (websites), sell instantly to bitcoin and move funds to your wallet instantly
Or you could trade shares of companies on decentralized exchanges where dividends and share value was already in your wallet. Skip the whole "selling and transfer money" part completely. The same wallet you were using to buy coffee with was the same that had your stocks in it.
Trading bitcoin-denominated bitcoin stocks was how I made most of my bitcoin. Several hundred at the peak

Monero unlinks the transaction. You have deniability about the ownership/loss/spending/control of the Monero. On Step 4, the Monero transaction is not traced to you in the blockchain. Nobody knows if one of those transactions is to your address, or to your friend's address, or to wherever such as an address nobody controls. The Monero blockchain first of all just doesn't contain this information, as it doesn't contain addresses at all. To elaborate for other people reading it, step 4 is necessary because the exchanges have records of what Monero address you sent something to and are a weak link. So Step 4 is the only unlinking transaction.
It is the solution to the problem presented which was how to anonymously transfer value to a friend across a border. Everything you do at the exits is non-anonymous and compliant with KYC with the respective countries or counterparties. Everything you do inside the cryptocurrency world, after converting to Monero, is opaque and incapable of complying with KYC.
If you cannot be compliant at the exits (exchanges), then you will need to find another way to obtain bitcoin or Monero to begin with, and then get to step 4. The only thing that matters is step 4.

anyway a rebuttal to your "priced in" theory, is that this still means the halving is causing the known constriction in supply. whether people bid up bitcoin before then or immediately at the halving or slowly after the halving, is a red herring. Everyone expects bitcoin to be more scarce as the creation of new bitcoin is constricted.
also, look at the options market. options merely 6 months out are so inefficiently priced, as despite how many pundits say "its priced in" based on the information available now, anything can happen, so prices are reflective of past volatility instead of future events

there's also the fact that EVERY SINGLE THING that helps decentralized nodes process more transactions better also helps VISA transact even more efficiently and cheaply!
in 2030 you think VISA will have just not changed their technology since 2015? Bitcoin is not a current threat or solution for VISA and it likely never will be, with current information.

woah woah woah that really isn't a great conclusion. If you look at the size of previous investments to hash rate, this isn't abnormal at all!
When ASICMiner raised like $500,000 it was huge, and they achieved ~30% of the network for a time period. And their mining sells were good too, as one of the only legitimate companies in this space.
Then ActiveMining had to raise ~$5,000,000 and it was huge. The hashrate was proportionally larger then and so was the investment needed.
Those two circumstances were 2012 and 2013 respectively, the hashrate is now exponentially higher, so more investment for smaller margins would be necessary now. $100 million is not out of line

People didn't think the government was taking it seriously, until the government did.
Everyone already knew of all of the solutions but just didn't implement them because there was no incentive to.
Every enforcement action strengthens the infrastructure in the way that all the theoretical research papers suggested.
Darknet markets use multisig. Vendors and customers are more security conscious. The market selects secure as well as reliable ones.
Look at the return governments have made on all subsequent darknet busts. The costs rise with more international collaboration and the returns diminish.

@_date: 2015-04-25 09:23:45
yeah duh. Back in 2012 and 2013 bitcoin companies were not capable of doing this because of the known costs of compliance. The cost/benefit analysis was out of sync, and people complained about it or reverted to juvenile anti-state rhetoric, simply deferring regulatory enforcement actions against their startup (all of which has since happened and most of those fail companies are gone now, hurray)
Coinbase was one of the first to start attempting it, they were able to raise capital and do it.
Bitcoin's market cap also rose dramatically during that time, making it worthwhile to entertain the compliance costs.

Individuals with good banking options really don't get a benefit from Bitcoin.
My domestic wire transfers really don't take days (only hours, just like bitcoin), getting cash from an ATM in a foreign country really is already very cheap for me, the cost of an actual wire transfer isn't a problem when you aren't sending pauper's amounts...etc.
I know of all the potential use cases, but the community needs to stop acting like already wealthy people *need* it like they need a 401k. Hoards of people aren't going to start shifting their income into bitcoin without an actual benefit to them personally.

@_date: 2015-11-11 17:35:13
A couple of misconceptions here, so maybe breaking down scenarios will help
a) if mining ceases, then it becomes extremely profitable for you to mine with just your PC as difficulty will drop to 1 at the next difficulty adjustment. You will be rewarded all of the bitcoin in the blocks found. the thing is that there are a lot of other people with PCs that will notice this too.
b) if you are mining blocks after the network is no longer rewarding new bitcoin, then you get bitcoin from the transaction fees.
c) it is possible for mining hash rate to drop very far below the current difficulty, slowing the network to a crawl until the next difficulty adjustment. This has happened in some altcoins. This is also mitigated by greed and a more distributed network

But even with 70,000 unconfirmed transactions, it wasn't a problem. Some of those fees per block were impressive, but then I looked at my transactions that went through, negligible (to me). Pretty cool!
I did experiment with a microtransaction system once and bitcoin was definitely too unwieldy for that idea.

Really? 


How can this be a rebuttal to OP
Do you know how shorting works? Only like 1% of bitcoin moves the markets on a daily basis so all he would have to do is go to a couple pools and say "hey would you like to earn interest on all that 100 Billion worth of bitcoin you guys never move at any price?" and they would accept that and he would take that bitcoin and sell it on the open market.
Shorting works by borrowing fungible assets, selling it ..... sitting on your hands ..... and then buying and identical asset back at a lower price, and giving it back to the person you borrowed it from. You just keep the difference in price.
If Mt Gox can barely sell 7,000 Bitcoin without crashing the market, someone that borrows 500,000 bitcoin for the sole purpose of selling can easily make their profit.

ways to disassociate from a bitcoin transaction
- You can unlink transactions with Monero. This is like a 5 step process. Subject to liquidity issues of Monero, but $25k - $50k any given day is easy, currently.
- You can give someone the private key, in exchange for cash. The problem with this is that they can't trust you don't also still have the private key. So you can instead do this with a multisig method. 2 of 3 multisig, you let them control two keys in exchange for cash, and have previously transferred the bitcoin to that address. There is nothing on the blockchain indicating you no longer control those funds.
- TOR and Shapeshift.io (subject to transfer limits) but a few thousand dollars is practical. Either as a general mixer or again using Monero because of it's opaque blockchain
- Steganography with an address in an anonymous art auction. Although participants are informed.

can't their software also go into a $25 computer though?
we criticized and made fun of the first secure hardware wallets when they sold for $120 too. people that didn't understand the market said "but R &amp; D costs! that why it costs so much" or similar rationalizations. $30 dollar ones came out less than 6 months later from different companies, so there is no need for this essay or rationalization of "what it does". If they demonstrate demand and the market criticizes it enough, then someone else that doesn't need to make a return on $21,000,000 will release a cheaper replica at a lower margin and still make enough money to support themselves. Thats how the market works.
Other hardware companies, like Apple, are able to get away with high markups in some of their devices because of monopolies in their intellectual property, along with their name.

What is the rebuttal to this? VISA could very well never upgrade any of their data centers ever, and my argument assumes they will.

MOST android apps rely on google play services. They've rolled out many many many helper functions that apps rely upon now.
An example - not necessarily relevant to bitcoin wallets - is location services. Getting a good location was a cumbersome process that was different across android versions and devices, lots and lots of code that ultimately didn't work very well for everyone. Google Play Services now has a really good location function built in, that is very elaborate and also leverages google play services. So now your app uses that code, requires Google Play to be installed, but it doesn't work in china.

They aren't *illegal* for U.S. *customers*.
Two things are at play here:
a) The FEDERAL government has a prohibition on *financial intermediaries* processing payments to and from online gambling sites. Of which online sports betting is exempt.
b) All 50 States have their OWN separate gambling prohibitions which can extend to both online and sports betting. These are typically way more clear cut and don't name financial intermediaries as the thing to stop the behavior.
c) Bitcoin and cryptocurrency do not require financial intermediaries to receive funds from a gambling site, so this renders a) moot, usually*. And States have no real means of stopping an offshore gambling operation at all, rendering b) moot.
*Coinbase has taken into its own hands to attempt to track which bitcoin have passed through gambling sites, and attempts to try not to process those transactions or keep the recipients as customers. There are many ways around this, but if this becomes overzealous then less opaque blockchain technologies will be used to remove this power away from Coinbase or anyone else that ever tries to limit the fungibility of cryptocurrency.

a) because its not the nodes you would need, it is the mining nodes
b) because you can do a 51% attack without having 51% of the mining nodes. All you need is to solve multiple blocks in a row. We have seen miners at 30-40% mine 6 blocks in a row. If they wanted to double spend, no merchant would have had safe guards against that. We have also seen papers beforehand that showed the theoretical possibility of doing it at 30%

I don't agree with that. When you get enough money for liquidity to actually fucking matter and realize you can't trade in most markets because its really illiquid, then you'll realize how useful HFT actually is. HFTs keep the spreads TIGHT. They give you a great price, and skim a few cents off here and there when they front run the rest of your order to the other exchange (there are other intermediaries they are buying and selling from all day whether you show up or not)
It is also lucrative. There are ways to game them too. The exchange they set up literally pays you to trade on it, whereas all the others one charge you to trade on them. (So you trade on their exchange with the fast fiber connections behind the scenes, so they know what you and everyone really wants to buy, and front runs the rest of their orders on the larger and more liquid exchanges... but if you are a poor retail investor then you won't actually have a large order, and your broker is the one that has to really deal with it) 
Look, people are just playing by some ineffective sets of rules. HFTs are a tool, the exchanges they set up are tools, the regulations are tools. None of that warren buffett or suze orman stuff are relevant tools, thats all there is to it.

Colloquially, this statement is to imply that they would be rich. *Money and taxes so funny haha, more of it! Thats the joke, we want that too so relatable!*
But practically it doesn't make sense since they would likely have paid a tiny lump sum of taxes when they earned the bitcoin from the mining, at the price it was valued at when it was mined. This would have been a the lowest of income tax rates, with deductions on electricity bill and depreciating the hardware, and the government would have likely paid them (from current year taxes withheld from other sources, or even prior years taxes paid) since it cost more than the earnings were worth. **So way less in taxes so far.**
Then from the ownership of cryptocurrency they would have cashed out one of the years at long term capital gains tax rates which have a much lower tax rate than income taxes, and are also very easy to offset, almost completely. They would have gotten taxed once. **So way less in tax RATE so far, with possibly one year having a large tax bill, but not multiple years like OP said.**
But lets assume OP sold in pieces across several years. Now the long term capital gains are always less and still easier to offset, mostly from losses in other assets if OP has any, but a useful strategy is to sell losing positions specifically for the loss deduction against winners. **So with simple tax harvesting, OP would have still paid lower taxes in both $$ and %.**
and finally, unrealized capital gains are not taxed, so even if OP was sitting on a big balance of bitcoin and never sold, they would not have been "paying way more in taxes over the last few years"

You can shapeshift Monero at 
Use Monero to pay for any Bitcoin service. Many people are improperly relying on ShapeShift.io to obfuscate the origin of their funds, but this is not anonymous. The blockchains are just obscure for now. I've done research on a similar service back in 2013, ie very convoluted mixer (whether centralized or decentralized). Hopping blockchains still leaves a trail. Although the service can delete records after a while, but even this isn't novel. This is exactly how Liberty Cash operated before the feds shut it down: tradable cryptographic tokens where the records of trades were deleted by the server. Blockchains just distribute the ownership of the tokens, a perk Liberty Cash did not have access to.
Using Monero (or a few other select options) would be anonymous.
Shapeshift can also adopt Monero, but many services are waiting on better GUI and daemon. As Monero is not forked from bitcoin at all, the only similarity is that there is a blockchain.

This is how the cryptocurrency space has been all along, stifling discussion about all other technologies because each network is desperate to attract investment into their own tech that there can't be any rational discussion anymore. It is pathetic really.
This sub is the most guilty, direct altcoin discussion is usually downvote censored to oblivion. Monero right now isn't easily ignored because it has utility and a lot of bitcoin-core devs have moved over to that project.

I was wondering why this entire aspect has been neglected.

I've seen whole dev teams extend their roadmap so they could update a website. So today, I'm focusing on the wallets. Especially with all the fanfare around Electrum 2.0

GenesisTrading initiates a blockchain transfer as soon as they receive the wire transfer. And vice versa.

Just in case anyone needed it spelled out. Common practice, nothing abnormal for a financial institution.
Solutions would be:
- To convert through Monero. This unlinks the transaction from a publicly traceable blockchain.
- Use a cryptocurrency gambling site (or even create one) and just run transactions - the rigged outcomes would be clean coins for the new identity you have as a user, so now just one or two hops away from being good enough for Coinbase
- Sell the private key in exchange for cash to someone more capable of acquiring goods and services with bitcoin and/or cleaning it via the above methods
- Buy a house. Real estate industry negotiated an exemption from AML/KYC with Congress =\

Well, for instance, there are assets on Counterparty and the Colored Coin platform that are directly tradeable for US dollars.
Both of those platforms are secured by the bitcoin blockchain, but the infinite number of assets created by them are not using bitcoin.
A cryptographic signature that represents an asset, is traded for US dollars. The transfer of ownership is recorded on the blockchain, even though the proportional amount of bitcoin is not moved.
This can dilute investment into the cryptocurrency space away from bitcoin for all eternity. The minuscule amounts of bitcoin necessary to cover the transaction fee would not contribute to bitcoin's scarcity until blocks were filled 10,000 times over. So the network would grind to a halt before these platforms contributed to bitcoin's scarcity in any meaningful way.
That is just one example.

The FDIC isn't broke, that is a very juvenile view of the possible problems with the FDIC. Although the law has more things insured than the FDIC could cover - at once - the FDIC has other tools to avoid this. During the financial crisis, without any authorization from Congress or additional law, the FDIC realized it could use its connections to all the banks and act as a broker. It successfully sold all the failing banks to larger banks (taking no commission for this sale) before it was ever required to cover the assets of customer accounts.

Since all of your bitcoin is a long term capital loss right now, just get the real cost basis, and the price you sell it at.
You can deduct long term capital losses against long term capital gains, so if your stock gains (that you've sold) were from stock you held for over one year, then you would be able to make this deduction.

@_date: 2015-03-18 21:52:02
No, and not the next TWO weeks.
The main reason I sold is because there is still not a good way to manage risk with bitcoin. The market just isn't mature enough, at one point I thought it would be by now. So I'm out for more mature markets. 
I plan to pass my funds through cryptocurrency for whatever their utility is, at whatever exchange rate, in the future. But just being long, or just being short in some fake insecure futures swap markets one overnight margin call away from loosing all the bitcoin, is not how you manage risk.
Also, not very bullish in the immediate term. Although that OTC market ETF looks fun, I can do that without owning bitcoin.

The only thing new is your occasional excess cash. SARs have been around for decades. The reporting requirements have been around for decades. The law against trying to get around reporting requirements have been around for decades, and the amounts have been unchanged.
Yes the thresholds are arbitrary, and it is hilarious to look at Greece's even more arbitrary thresholds of EU1500 or EU100. 
But there is nothing unique or new about it.
When the banker hears you have $25,000+ with them, their entire attitude will change for the better. You don't matter at amounts of $5000 or $15000, **I'd** file a suspicious activity report hoping the Government makes it so you'd never waste my time again.

your stock gains are short term capital gains
you can only deduct short term capital losses from short term capital gains, if you have none of those, then you can't do the deduction.
you can only deduct long term capital losses from long term capital gains.
so you will pay the full income tax (short term capital gains are taxed the same as income), and you will eat the full capital loss* for now.
*you can still deduct $3000 this year anyway from this capital loss against your total income tax liability. and continue to carry over $3000 + $500 each year in more deductions, up to seven years. you can also deduct the full remaining long term capital loss against any long term capital gain you get in the next 7 years.

Monero's devs are definitely making the wrong decisions when it comes to a GUI wallet. They want a complete point of sale system that makes coffee and other bells and whistles instead of a basic GUI wallet. There are unofficial ones though, but what they are doing with the database is more important. Then other people can build on top of it, this is almost available, and is compilable right now, just not officially released.
Monero works. It just doesn't have a GUI wallet. Shapeshift - and other services - haven't added Monero because of the database developments. (Basically the cryptonote protocol kept the entire blockchain in RAM, has been a bitch and a half for the Monero team to correct this inefficiency and store it in a database).
There are no hopes and promises, Monero works right now and has more than the $5,000 daily volume / $300K market cap that Shadowcash has. This doesn't tell us much about the underlying technology though, I found Shadowcash to be promising but incredibly esoteric. I liked that it was forked from bitcoin-core but there are some key problems Monero addresses that I just don't see any random implementation of stealth addresses and gobblygook doing.

It is a little counterintuitive from the way you might use the capital markets, but it isn't a complicated concept. There are lots of little exchanges. Your broker routes an order to all the exchanges to get your trade filled really quickly at the best prices. But these exchanges are different distances from each other, hence different ping times. When your order hits the first exchange - whichever one it may be - the HFT changes all of it's orders on all the remaining exchanges, there are enough fractions of a millisecond for the algorithm to see what happens on one exchange and change it's orders on all the remaining exchanges, before your order reaches the other exchanges, due to the physical properties of the speed of light.
In this case the same HFT operator is maintaining the best prices for the asset on all the exchanges. But they will change their prices (worse prices for you) on all the other exchanges as soon as one exchange's order gets hit.
If you really want the asset, you will get a partial fill, and then change your order to the worse price so you can own it. The HFT guy has sold at a better price for themself.
The HFT guy also owns and set up one of the exchanges, specifically with the best and fastest internet connection, the best commissions and rebates and everything, so that orders will be attracted to it. Specifically so they can see what happens there and get data to the other part of their order algorithm.

I believe that their business model will be short lived.
The simplistic business model of "spend $X,XXX for an ATM" "set spreads to HIGH" "set fee to 5%" "collect cash at the end of the week" is set to fail. It does not adequately solve a need.
Every ATM operator that thinks they are patiently solving a need by collecting their small margin and hoping to make a small profit are deluded.
They need to subsidize it or upsell other things around the ATM, or just be able to afford an ATM just like many full node operators are altruistic.

Solutions would be:
- To convert through Monero. This unlinks the transaction from a publicly traceable blockchain.
- Use a cryptocurrency gambling site (or even create one) and just run transactions - the rigged outcomes would be clean coins for the new identity you have as a user, so now just one or two hops away from being good enough for Coinbase
- Sell the private key in exchange for cash to someone more capable of acquiring goods and services with bitcoin and/or cleaning it via the above methods
- Buy a house with bitcoin. Real estate industry negotiated an exemption from AML/KYC with Congress =\

there is nothing wrong with a SAR. You guys and plenty others are chilled by the fact that there is a reporting requirement, but you guys treat the REPORTING REQUIREMENT ITSELF like an impending criminal charge!
What is up with you guys and being afraid of lists.
Like its the Freddy Kreuger of paperwork.
**EVERYBODY WEALTHIER THAN YOU ALSO HAS THOSE THINGS FILED ON THEM AND NOTHING HAPPENS**, how do you think people even do business in this country? Millions are transferred each and every day as America is filled with many many wealthy people. Cash is deposited and withdrawn from banks in large amounts. Large wire transfers and checks happen all day every day.
"OMG I can't bring $10,000 dollars into the country because then there will be a REPORT about it, police state!" NOT A REPORT, GOD ANYTHING BUT THAT, DAMN PAPERWORK YOU SCARY. Just declare it like the form asks and keep your $10,000, nobody cares about your $10,000 peon. Not declaring it and getting caught with it results in seizure and possible criminal liability, declaring it results in nothing* (most of the time ha... ha......yeah)
The only result is that if you neglect to account for it on your taxes, it takes the IRS a lot less time to realize "hey you had cash at some point in time, what happened to that", instead of being completely lost on their own revenue collection shortfall.
It helps the FED keep track of the M2 money supply because of the various checkpoints they've put up at the borders of the country and the financial institutions that report to them.

SecondMarket operates an OTC market which operates by wire transfers and has a minimum 25 btc per order. So at current exchange rates, the $25 wire fee is practically free (less than .05% of the minimum 25 btc) because there are no plebeians trying to transfer their allowance and complaining about fees. 
As someone that is literally afraid of both coinbase and my ongoing banking relationships by using coinbase, SecondMarket is better all around. Also its a wire, so kinda instant.
@_date: 2016-05-16 00:15:18
You have to consider a) the price of a bitcoin and then b) the transaction fee
Even though the last bitcoin will be mined by then, the block reward would have been 0.5 bitcoin for a long long long time, possibly decades.
The transaction fee earnings would have surpassed the block reward long before then, so the network will be maintained by the remaining miners that process those transactions.
and that's why it doesn't matter what the blocksize is? It is a fun thought exercise, but you have to ask "what would 0.5 bitcoin be worth by then"
If that was just $100 with the purchasing power of $100 today, then not much, if that was worth $100,000 with the purchasing power of $100,000 today, then that would be pretty cool, let alone for higher numbers.
The blocksize debate today and in the future will come from the cost necessary for a user of bitcoin to send a transaction. We will continually reach periods of time when this may seem unwieldy for consumers. But the network itself will be fine no matter how many transactions get to be included in each block.
Sorry for the non answer. Hope it gave others some insight.

Okay, I think a good start for you would be the ongoing ban on "Onion futures" in the United States. Onion futures being a derivative on the exchange rate of an actual onion.
In 1958 US Congress banned Onion futures in an attempt to reduce volatility. This is the only futures contract ever explicitly banned by Congress, until 2010. As you might have noticed, even with bitcoin, the futures regulator (the CFTC) is open for basically anything, so sometimes Congress makes directly opposite decisions of this agency.
Anyway, there are research papers on the ensuing volatility of onion prices before and after this ban, giving a distinct look at how a futures market can help or hurt a commodity with unique properties. Spoiler: ban did not help volatility, onion price transparency and discovery decreased as producers could no longer control risk and trade future price on national markets, volatility increased.
Derivatives don't inherently increase artificial assets. The blockchain offers unparalleled transparency into the availability of assets, so as this space matures you can see a revolution in how reserves are kept up with in a ledger, especially as exchanges move to multisig wallets for individual accounts. 
There are different kinds of derivatives, so you will realize that despite whatever Michael Moore makes a documentary about, there is more to the story. Derivatives aren't the big bad finance boogeyman, derivatives are simply "assets *derived* from other assets". 
So yeah, shorting collateralized credit default swaps backed by housing payments from poorly qualified homeowners was pretty fucked up, that has nothing to do with shutting your brain off when you hear the word derivative.

And I realize that I can get better returns in more liquid established markets (there are no ways to make non-directional trades in bitcoin, you literally have to be correct on the market direction with bitcoin to make any profit, in more established markets you can trade volatility without caring about if the stock/commodity goes up or down).

Residency is not citizenship. Citizenship allows you the flexibility to drop an old citizenship when desired, to free yourself from the potentially worldwide jurisdiction of the prior country. EU citizenship is one of the best hassle free travel documents in the world, next to or on par with United States.
So if you want a prolongued Euro trip you can do that, but if you want to play that game, getting a work visa is even cheaper, and again there are 28 countries in the euro zone to shop around in and check out their different requirements. In Germany, you simply need a letter from an existing German company stating an intent to work (not a job offer or position) and a 25 euro fee to the appropriate federal agency. If approved, the whole continent is yours for 3-5 years.

the federal government has a law - intended to ban online gambling - by making it a crime for any financial intermediary to service gambling companies and proceeds. 
The online gambling company is not illegal, and the gambler is not doing any illegal. They just had no way to gamble using US institutions and settlement networks. Bitcoin doesn't require those, but companies that have money transmitter licenses are financial intermediaries by zero stretch of the imagination and can't knowingly service gambling companies and proceeds.

This is completely optional, and not free, but it allows for much greater sanctions against an infringer.

And you don't have to be afraid of Coinbase cancelling your awesome exchange rate now either!

At this point I'm just thinking about doing the $250/day recurring buy until I get an overdraft on my bank account. The Coinbase fees are approximately equivalent to 4% at this amount.
In the past I would call up Barry Silbert at Genesis Trading during a weekday and be done with it, but I don't have the minimum $17,000 all at once to move into bitcoin for now.
Maybe I'll set up wires to GDAX, since wires cost $25 as long as I wire an amount where 4% would be greater than $25 I would be coming out ahead in both cost and time. So basically minimum $700

This is mainly a followup about the lack of ways to get bitcoin conveniently. Although this scenario is true, people's favorite places like bitinstant are great, if you are poor. This is mainly a jab at the $ limits on that site and others, not the purchasing power of libertarians.
These limitations will keep larger sums from getting into bitcoin, if the person only has passing interest in the currency. I know why some of these limits have to be there, but what can we do about it?
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:22:25
Imagine harder.
The liquidity of the public exchanges is only reflective of people that don't have the 25 bitcoin minimums to move. You know, the people that pray, dream and brag about owning 1 bitcoin some time in the future. The people that can't wait to remind people to only invest what they can afford to lose, when someone mentiones a 4 figure amount.
OTC exchanges don't even have accounts, it is all on-chain transactions. So go look at the latest block and imagine that any one of those 10,000 bitcoin transfers has an equal and opposite US dollar wire transfer associated with it.

when traders with less money want to place limit orders, they don't want to buy at the ask because they might be paying too much, so they instead place an order at a new bid price that is more likely to get filled. when they see a trader with a HUGE bid of $700,000, they will be less likely to get filled if they place an order below that bid because the $700,000 bid will have to get filled completely before they get filled.
so the smaller trader places a bid higher than the $700,000, and other traders that want to get filled even faster place a bid higher than the previous trader, another does the same... etc etc
the strategy is that maybe the $700,000 bidder wants this to happen, because this raises the price of bitcoin and more people are likely to not want to place bids and instead just buy at the higher ask price, filling the sellers immediately instead of waiting.... if it doesn't work and the price keeps decreasing, the $700,000 bidder will simply cancel their order before it gets filled or filled completely.

The notion being that he was overzealous and just trying to make a name for himself. I don't remember the names here, but this is where we are right now.

It happens, if you do this without volume then you will not make a profit and maybe a loss.
So you could it with promotions, or "investor awareness" campaigns. These cost $1000 - $15000 in general, not necessarily with cryptocurrency. Anyway, this gives you enough volume to sell higher priced assets to the rush of new bids.

Shutting down the exchange? 
a) No it isn't like banks preventing depositors from withdrawing money.
b) Nasdaq, NYSE and *every exchange* has trading halts. And the regulators even force a trading halt during periods of "extreme volatility" that would have had a bitcoin-like asset shut down for weeks on end.
expanding on a) New mt gox users probably didn't realize that they could have just transferred their bitcoins to another exchange within a matter of hours. This is *impossible* with any bank or stock/commodities exchange.
expanding on b) in America, a 10% move automatically shuts down stocks. A greater percent move automatically is a trade halt for a longer period of time. In the futures market, assets are not even allowed to trade after X many points in one direction a single day.
so c) maybe you aren't American but more likely you just don't know what you are talking about

bitcoin does not attempt to solve issues related to byproducts of greed and wealth distribution, therefore your premise is flawed.
the 2008 liquidity crisis was a result of incestuous leveraging causing an asset price bubble, where those assets were bought again by borrowing against those same assets.
You have a very simplistic view of issues that bother you.
@_date: 2013-07-17 21:38:54
We aren't talking about short selling, we are talking about forward delivery of your long position, or liquidating your hedge before expiration/delivery date for a profit, which is added back into your long.
For your example question here, by selling futures instead of just selling a portion of your position, your profit/loss will look similar whether price went up or down. Someone that isn't speculating on bitcoins and instead uses them will find this beneficial, but there are plenty of other ways to keep your purchasing power stable despite volatility of the underlying asset.
With options on the other hand, if your long kept increasing in value, your option hedge will quickly decrease to zero so it won't continue offsetting your gains, but if your long was decreasing in value, your option (a long put) would gain in value so exponentially fast that it will offset losses in your long.
This is better than selling X% of your long because you can't foresee price direction.

this is hardly such an out of the ordinary attack, "privilege escalation" is a well known field in 'hacker school' waaaay before bitcoin was the reward.
you get one piece of information and use that piece of information to access other information
the gmail was compromised, then it was easy to assume that google voice had the same credentials or was linked to the same gmail account (its a google account after all, and google pushed to consolidate all of those), it was easy to see what accounts the user has signed up for because the gmail has all the emails, and then the user accessed them and took them over

okay, instead of delete how about an export-and-remove function, where the exported address is put in a new wallet and then deleted from the existing one, its kind of like how cut and paste has such more utility than copy and paste, but asking for the feature around Apple fans would get a response like "why don't you just copy, paste and then remove the file from the original location, and then delete it from the trash bin, I can't see any reason why you can't just do that all the time every single time this rare case comes up"

Are you seriously having this debate with yourself? This is an instrument whose market cap fluctuates between $500 million to $1 billion daily.
Any ole' nobody can own that much in shares of a $1 billion dollar company and nobody will bat an eye. Seriously, what percentage is 1/21,000th. Even in regulated instruments there are no reporting requirements for someone with an allocation as small as yours. They doesn't even start till you own 5% then 10% etc. No form 4's have to be filed, no position limits have to be disclosed in *ANY MARKET* at the measily percentage which impresses you.
How did you end up thinking "wow, $55,000" given your self-stated financial fuck-ups you are probably one trade away from being under the pattern day trader rule in the stock markets. (This is a $25,000 threshold btw)
I think it is interesting that you have sparked a philosophical discussion amongst people, trying to determine the scale of "classes" with no base unit, always a fruitless endeavor. But all of that has nothing to do with your position size.

I think its interesting how abrahamic religions deal with inflationary interest based economies. Given that Islam is the only one left practicing avoiding interest based systems, I've been watching how their economies approach the problems.
It is kind of interesting how loans are restructured on paper to make them not technically interest based, and therefore shariah compliant, but if you dig deep enough most banks in islamic countries are holding large non-shariah compliant assets.
The main conclusion is that it is (read: was) impractical to do business with shariah compliant lending practices. But now given that bitcoin is available, and is not a leveraged economy yet, there may be opportunity for islamic money practices to evolve more in line with shariah compliance.

the folly of dollar cost averaging applies across all asset classes and the statistical implications apply equally - not just in stock markets - as I said in another post, this is a false dilemma "dollar cost averaging, or not" deliberately neglecting other ways to manage a portfolio.

facts: 
blockchains are a more efficient technology for storing value and wealth than precious metals are, just like "electronic mail" is a more efficient way of communicating than postal mail
in any decent amount of proliferation, the units of value within a blockchain will become more expensive
this will happen due to people realizing that blockchains are a more efficient version of what they already do, and people looking for a store of value outside of fiat currencies that provides more liquidity than precious metals. Precious metals do not provide liquidity at all.
security. despite the codebase being secure, there are future unknowns about the continued viability of servicing the necessary elements of a blockchain economy. people resorted to banks in the first place because of the security perks the banks provided for storing their wealth
this is what experts know. this is what everyone knows. if some tiny country with a tiny 13 billion USD economy decided to switch completely to bitcoin, you could expect bitcoin's exchange rate to rise 800% higher than the $124/usd it is trading at today to accommodate an additional 13 billion USD of value being stored in its blockchain

Yes, in this paradigm it would be expected of the government to process transactions of the economy as established by the people's whim, believe it or not, many municipale governments operate by how people vote.

to show you how it would work. your address is empty, there are no transactions to that address. the consequences are moot, you don't have the private key to that address anyway so it doesn't matter where they sent it from
but the main point is that in the amount of time it takes to complete the tutorial, a transaction to that address would not have finished, so to do the donation example they would have to send bitcoin from an address that already has a balance (theirs)

there are things called tax events.
tax events happen no matter what denomination they happen in.
so lets talk about the US federal government:
if you buy bitcoin, you have a cost basis. you sell them and you incur capital gains tax. short term capital gains (sold to fiat within 365) are the same as income taxes, long term capital gains have their own favorable tax treatment. If you never sell, there is no capital gains tax event, but this assumes that you aren't spending them for anything. The IRS will frown upon spending pre-tax earnings.
if you mine bitcoin, you are earning in your for profit endeavor, this is income and is a tax event. you can deduct the cost of doing business (hardware, electricity, security, educational materials)
if you earn bitcoin wages, this is income. your employer should be withholding income as it is generated.
gambling winnings in bitcoin? income
dividends from bitcoin stocks? also a tax event
and so on and so forth.

when and if those culture's nuances do become relevant to society, they have an advantage
If the industrial revolution never happened, the things Germany is good at would be completely irrelevant, for example. Their quirky robotic efficiency would have zero relevance on the world stage.
Jewish financiers have been shifting assets and resources around in amounts that FAR FAR outpace the world's liquidity for hundreds of years. You have to understand, "liquidity" and "finance" wasn't RELEVANT half a century ago, coincidental strides in market efficiency have contributed to growing that sector's relevance by orders of magnitude since the 1980s. Main st wasn't nearly as connected to the random wheeling and dealing on walls street and government financing, so the reindeer games related to finance were just boring inconsequential things, that some Jewish people had a decent stake in.

mt gox counts because if you want to get large amounts IN to bitcoin easily, you will need to hit all exchanges. So the average price of 127 reflects the fact that you will be buying bitcoin on mt gox, bitstamp, others at the same time.

this isnt emotion, your understanding is limited.
if someone paid 70 btc for a machine in january, they want to make 70 btc and more btc. This isn't likely to happen as difficulty rises higher, because their machine likely hasn't made the 70 btc yet. Their machine is making a fraction of a btc, and they keep mining hoping that difficulty doesn't appreciate as fast, stays the same, or decreases.
if difficulty stays the same, then miners have another two weeks to make the same amount they have been making. if difficulty decreases then miners will make more btc, and get closer to breaking even on their initial investment or simply making more btc. 
since there are many many many miners that bought equipment denominated in BTC (avalon, asicminers), they will continue mining at *ANY* difficulty, under the bet that there will be drops in difficulty at some point. There are miners that are exposed to the exchange rate changes, and the assumption is that some of them will drop out.
This keeps difficulty at a certain level, only to rise as more machines come online.

As someone who isn't "anti-government" or "anti-regulation", your broad plea for agreement only highlights your lack of understanding.
The rest of this post exclusively is about the USA.
For instance, producers would absolutely require forward delivery  of bitcoins in a futures market. And nobody will touch a futures market without the oversight of the CFTC. The CFTC is the federal government's futures market regulator in the US.

THEY were not the ones that banned onion futures and box office receipt futures, Congress did.
Your current outlook is "regulator = bad" when you seem to have no idea what they can do. No contract for forward delivery can be traded in the US without the CFTC's regulation, so this isn't something to even try to avoid actually. The existing futures exchanges already need the CFTC's consent on some issues, and having an infrastructure for settling disputes quickly (outside of the courts) is how these exchanges and the CFTC cooperate.
The current head of the CFTC is very excited about bitcoins btw. You should court him.
"The government" isn't one single body. It is the legislature, the executive branch with the all the numerous agencies, and the judicial branch. Within the executive branch, all the numerous agencies are largely autonomous and are frequently MUCH more sane than the legislature (congress). This isn't a political statement, this is illuminating where you should focus your energies.

so until it is more widely used to purchase and verify property ownership, I'm just going to be sitting on it. Ironic because I had been investing my bitcoin with people raising capital, but now I'll just be the hoarding currency speculator.
@_date: 2013-08-22 01:19:14
the exchange rate is a side effect, but it doesn't matter if bitcoins are $2 or $200, the transaction fee structure is such that the bitcoin economy needs to grow with the block reward halving, the block reward's purpose is to spur the economy and then eventually ween transaction processors (miners) away from that teet to be supplanted more so by transaction fees.
Currently then number of transactions fees are lower than they should be, and the block reward split to .05 bitcoins rewarded per block 100 years from now will be when the transaction fees in each block consistently are greater the block reward
And we don't want that.
Given the price of bitcoin today, with the measly transaction fees from the aggregate transactions in block, the exchange rate will take care of itself with if the number of transactions are where they should be, in relation to speculation of course.

Therefore their taxes get smaller and smaller the larger your amounts are. To me, Mt. Gox's fees are tolerable at transferring $2500 and over.

I'm not concerned about bitcoin's fiat exchange rate, literally at all. The selling of futures and alt coins adequately hedge my bitcoin holding's volatility.
buying an ASIC had more to do with my available bitcoin reserves, and how many bitcoins it would generate.
I also received the ASIC within 48 hours of making that decision, buyers from other vendors probably have and still have to actually consider faith, due to the time and uncertainty they have had to wait, but I have been coasting independent of those woes.

These miners wouldn't be able to get control over this block chain, because the network will always accept ghash.io's blocks, but they would be able to fork it but they would have to fork it to something that ghash.io wouldn't be able to just hop on and continue the same practices with

a) people are indoctrinated to believe that market efficiency means that every has the same capabilities, advantages and disadvantages in the market. This is not true
b) In the US, there are a lot of market and "trading" related things that *ONLY* the SEC will enforce, and some other subset of things that *ONLY* the CFTC will enforce. The SEC's jurisdiction is limited to making sure that *offerings* of securities (companies raising capital) and happening in a "fair and orderly fashion". The CFTC's jurisdiction is limited to certain functions of the futures market and fining floor traders for getting too rowdy. The SEC relies on brokers to report certain kinds of suspicious trading to the agency, as it is incapable of monitoring the markets. 
So yes, lack of regulation allows many many liberties to the bitcoin market and for people to take advantage of inefficiences.
For instance, market manipulation isn't inherently illegal even in the regulated markets. But being caught manipulating the price of a COMPANY's stock far beyond the rational market's demand will come with civil and possibly criminal sanctions from the agency.

the prices are different on all those exchanges because it costs the much to get USD onto those exchanges.
you cannot get USD onto btc-e without a 5% hit.  so spot price = ~$122.49 - 5% = 116.3655
so you might think SEE ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITY but good luck buying at $113, waiting 2 hours transferring to mtgox, to sell at $122 and HOPEFULLY making more than the 5% you already lost.

Yet bitcoin's market cap = 
11,274,675 (bitcoins mined)
$1,150,016,850 (@ $102 btc/usd)
and ASICMiner =
24% of total hash rate (  )
yet ASICMiner currently trades at =
10% of bitcoin market cap
without issuing dividends ASICMiner should trade at =
24% of bitcoin market cap
this puts the share price at =
BTC 6.76  ( (BTC's issued * .24 ) / 400000 shares )
and this represents a =
234% price increase from today's prices
ASICMiner does issue dividends making the shares more attractive than holding bitcoins and would logically trade at a premium to its network value (the % it contributes to the bitcoin network)
* TL;DR ASICMiner shares are very cheap.
ASICMiner plans to increase its hashing capabilities by a large factor putting it closer to 33% or 40% of the hash rate, and this is not currently priced in to the stock price.

the only problem, like this and other forms of testing like this, is that it requires voluntarily compliance to state your status at all, which is where the societal roadblocks will prevail (where ignorance is truly bliss). I've patched this dilemma before, but I haven't implemented it, basically it assumes that EVERYONE is unclean until proven otherwise.
So in your thing, every address is created in the "unclean" state, which people would avoid, every address in the blockchain is "flagged" until proven to be clean, or proven to have particular diseases.
The way the transaction actually works is unknown, maybe in a few years with &lt;14nm integrated circuit creation, we can have low power IC's tattooed on our skin which can initiate a transaction when in proximity to another IC tattoo on someone else (kind of like NFC), and change a few bits on the IC. Then that can be updated to the blockchain later when that IC is read by a device with a higher powered radio (your mobile phone)
Similarly, the elephant in the room - HIV - still has a 6 month delay in being able to detect. So yes when a previous partner's address gets flagged with it and the rest of the chain is alerted, it still could be too late. But it could still help weed out this thing quicker, I look forward to the self-segregating population and how that will diminish disease transmission, but there are still problems initially.

that own't be a big event, although it will rely on bitcoin's exchange rate being higher than it is now, it will simply mean the transaction fee reward will be a much greater proportion of the bitcoin found per block. This also relies on bitcoin's proliferation and will be a self fulfilling prophecy (higher exchange rate, more transactions with fees that get sent to miners)
given *any* growth of bitcoin the aggregate transaction fees will become larger than the block reward, making the block reward halving to be less and less noticeable.

there wouldn't be an arms race for hashing power. in this form of governance, municipalities will be directly invested in the health of the economy by processing transactions for the global economy.
One would only have to look forward in the future 10 years, or even just 2016 to see the block reward eclipsed by the transaction fees earned in each new block found. Private entities - based on the way they operate today - will have a lot less incentive to mine and it would be more practical for an organized government to do the transaction processing.

its $45 dollars and a $11 fee on the japan bank (total $56), so since most other money transmitting methods charge a 5% fee (and/or take 3 business days) then the obvious goal should be to wire an amount which makes $56 a much lesser percentage of the amount you sent. If you send $2,000 then $56 is a 2.8% fee. If you send $5,000 its just a 1% fee.
I do like how these monetary thresholds keep poor people / cash constrained people out, and the volatility low. Because when someone is sending $200 dollars they scrounged up, they are probably going to need it for public transportation or car repairs and panic sell.

Mt Gox's "rigamorogue with the US Gov" isn't what makes it difficult to withdraw funds. Its the japanese bank they moved to that doesn't have facilities to keep US dollar reserves for the volume they need. They aren't running a proper corporate account at a business bank that can cater to their needs.
Case in point, I never used Dwolla to send money to Mt Gox, it was always wires. Wires always worked. People moving amounts under $2000 don't use wires due to the fees. Above $2000 wires are both faster and cheaper than other methods, in a scatterplot of time/money. Wires won't work now because their current japanese bank doesn't have the reserve capabilities.

yep, I'm just highlighting the inefficiencies of comparing buying bitcoins to mining, as they are unrelated risk profiles. 
When buying (as opposed to mining) are these people dollar cost averaging? buying the same amount as they would have spent on the hardware? something else? Given that mining is luck based, it is impossible to determine what position size for buying bitcoins is "equivalently" better. This is further compounded by people's expectations for the exchange rate, if that is a factor for them.

no, I told you what it does. 
Instead of you, a human, looking at the exchange order books and deciding if you want to fill someone or place a new order that sits publicly  on the order book, the algorithm reads the order book via scraping or api, and simply waits for someone else to publicly put their order on the book, if it matches what you have instructed the algorithm to do, then it immediately fills you with that order. There can be a lot of algorithms waiting for the same price, so then it comes down to latency.

the cryptocurrency that I BOUGHT was maybe 15% of my portfolio
earned 6x as many bitcoin as I bought, from trading cryptocurrencies and crypto stocks
so at this point bitcoin is 90% of my portfolio, due to quantity and exchange rate, and thats AFTER cashing out of my litecoin and peercoin hedge last week, which had doubled my cryptocurrency holdings. There are a lot of noobs playing wall street here and I'm taking them all to the cleaners, of course anarcho-capitalists suck at daytrading, they don't have brokerage accounts!
Will be keeping that core position no matter how large it grows in US dollars, I have some uncomfortably large positions in bitcoin and litecoin denominated securities that I can't trade out of yet, so I'll be watching the distributed securities exchange projects and investing in those.

it doesn't matter if the miners went for a higher sale price (in btc), in an actually active bitcoin network, blocks will have (for example) 20 or 100 bitcoins in transactions fees, instead of a .01 that only some blocks have on occasion. It will be completely unpredictable but it won't matter what difficulty rises to because you or your pool will be finding such random sized blocks that if you just keep your miner running for a time you can expect to make it back, unlike today where the block size is totally predictable
The block reward is made to spur the economy until transaction fee earnings are greater than the block reward.
This is not happening.

lol you also have no idea what you are talking about, low volume on MtGox does not prove the assumption you already made before deciding volume would confirm it.
It actually completely disproves your theory. High volume on MtGox would be more indicative of people trading bitcoin for fiat in speculation. Low volume is because people are transacting in bitcoins OFF THE EXCHANGES and not interested in going back to fiat.
This is the bitcoin economy:
Money is flowing between addresses, and not back to fiat.
It is very simple to move bitcoins off of the exchange, and non-speculators have done so.

A price increase does change that equation. A 3 gigahash GPU rig would be profitable if bitcoins exchanged for $500 at today's difficulty.
The simple point I made is that saying GPU's were unprofitable forever since a static time in history is neglecting the fluctuations of relevant variables.
The same thing happened in September 2012 when bitcoins exchanged for $2 but difficulty didn't drop far enough for most gpu miners, people would then say "GPU mining isn't profitable anymore since September 2012" but look, here you are making the same proclamation about a time 8 months after that

a) yes it is easy to retrieve money in fiat. there are plenty of online exchanges that can link to a bank account
b) yes, certain banks flag bitcoin transactions (and freeze accounts) because 1) bitcoin threatens their existence 2) their overzealous anti-money laundering laws and policies are undermined by bitcoin
c) if bitcoin reaches its real potential then one would not need to "cash out" into a fiat currency, as bitcoin will be used on a broader scale to buy property, general consumption, pay taxes etc.
d) bitcoin is not a stock. it is a new asset class that has elements of commodities and currencies. commodities and currencies trade on different exchanges than stocks do. The only reason I point this out is because you will experience more cognitive dissonance if you compare it to stocks.
e) the risks exist on a wiki somewhere. they are real risks. and the security challenge (protecting your bitcoin) is not intuitive.

It is important to understand just how transportable bitcoin addresses are.  And you need to understand the different between addresses and wallets. Wallets hold multiple addresses and are used by programs. Addresses can exist solely in the blockchain without a program (although initially, a program will need to generate the address).
Addresses contain your bitcoin balance.
With a private key - which you can write down, or memorize in your head (not recommended) - you can load your address on any computer or phone anywhere in the world and have all of your bitcoins at that point in time. So even if your harddrive crashed you can just load all your bitcoins on another machine just by typing in your private key and all transactions that were sent to that address get loaded at that point in time.
An address never needs to be connected to the internet to receive bitcoins, and can be offline for years, when you want to use those bitcoins you can load that address into a computer and it will download all the transactions sent to it.
This has just eliminated currency controls at customs and border checkpoints across the world.

1) All blocks contain a "block reward" which are new bitcoins, as well the aggregate total of all transaction fees taken from transactions put in that block. These are all given to who finds the block.
For a long time, and even into today, Pools kept all the transaction fees, so maybe a few dozen people (pool operators) were familiar with them. But in each block they can be just a few fractions of a bitcoin, to several times the block reward itself.
The block reward is there to spur the economy, and it halves over time, the block reward decreases over time and the transaction fees grow over time. In a healthy bitcoin economy the transaction fees will be consistently more than the block reward. I think this aspect is quite genius. 
The block reward is 25 btc currently. I have seen blocks mined which contained 59btc, where the transaction fees completely eclipse the block reward.
When the block reward halves to 12.5 btc, then to 6.25, then to 3.12 then to 1.6, then to 0.8, the transaction fees will be greater than the block reward.
By 2140, it is largely expected that fiat will decrease invalue another 99.5% due to inflation. So given any demand for bitcoin, each 1 bitcoin will be worth a lot more than it is today and thats just if demand remained exactly where it is now. So when the block reward is 0.8 bitcoins and the transaction fees are only 1 bitcoin, doubling the size of the block. A miner will be very pleased.
Given the existence of any transactions, bitcoin mining can go on forever, always recycling the fees into smaller fractions of bitcoins. IIRC Combining these smaller amounts into larger transactions creates a greater amount of transaction fees, continuing the cycle.
2) Litecoin.  But Namecoin has interesting utility.
3) Not that I know of. But you can register domain names with Namecoin. Litecoin has a stock exchange. But none of the altcoins have enough activity to see any meaningful transaction fees in their blocks as of yet.

The transaction ID will allow anyone to see the bitcoin address that the funds came from ("account", for the sake of analogy) , and the bitcoin address that the funds went to.

futures and options are leveraged products that require less capital than holding the direct asset, therefore by selling futures you use less capital, always at the proper proportion to your long holdings (so as not to overleverage yourself in the event of delivery) and if the asset decreases in price your futures will still gain as if you were short the entire contract or amount of the underlying asset.
anyway, you can use these as a trading tool after a rally, instead of immediately after you go long. This allows you to lock in gains if you believe there will be a selloff. Not the dumbest investment concept I have ever come across.

your short sighted view of the infrastructure is the same as this now famous pessimistic view of the internet from 1995
All criticisms this person made were about the lack of infrastructure to support the visionaries' claims at the time. Yet, fast forward to now, practically everything he mentioned became a reality only 5 years later, the protocol behind the internet did not change, and it required individuals to create the infrastructure to support what the visionaries and everyone else that understood the protocol would continue to flaunt.
it has nothing to do with bitcoin having the same impact as the internet, it has to do with the fact that the underlying bitcoin protocol won't change much in a future where bitcoin is easier to use, because that aspect has nothing to do with bitcoin itself, it has to do with individuals creating a supporting infrastructure to fill a need

- current version of the protocol only allows several transactions per second (or something)
- the number of transaction fees is too small (not the *amount* of the transaction fee, don't get confused) to properly spur the bitcoin transaction processing incentive (mining) as the block reward decreases

its funny because you act like you know what you are talking about.
Read the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Act of 1934 again.
tl;dr they cover securities. Not commodities, currencies, or things that have nothing to do with ownership of a company.
Case in point, the SEC would regulate ASICMiner, not the denomination it trades in.
ONLY the SEC regulates price manipulation, and that is only in stock markets. There is no US regulator making it illegal to manipulate price of other assets.
The only thing the CFTC would do is force higher margin requirements and limit how many points up or down an asset could rise or fall in one trading session... in the US.

the economic aspects of bitcoin are clever. the code itself takes the place of the federal reserve regarding inflation and spurring the economy.
No amount of quantitative easing will be able to spur economic growth in a refined and predictable way as this algorithm can.
new bitcoin is distributed in a finite and known amount called the "block reward". All blocks contain a block reward, as well as transactions that have occurred since the previous block, and all those transactions can choose to be processed at higher priority for a bitcoin fee. The aggregate fees from those transactions are included in a block.
whoever (or the group of whoevers) finds the block earns the block reward and the aggregate fees. As the block reward decreases over time, the # of transactions with fees has to increase to make up for the block reward earnings.
This feature of the protocol alone gives all bitcoin holders an incentive to improve the infrastructure of bitcoin to do things that make more transactions happen (grow the economy). This is completely independent of the speculative aspects of the exchange rate.
The transaction fees earned per block can be a lot greater than the block reward. Currently the block reward is 25 bitcoin, and the average transaction fees earned per block are .25 bitcoin. The block reward will halve in 2016 to 12.5 bitcoin per block. We would like to see the aggregate earned transaction fees per block be a lot greater, but there will be a time when the transaction fees match the block reward, whether it is the year 2080 or 2140 when the block reward has halved to 0.5 bitcoin, and the transaction fees still only account for .25 - 0.5 bitcoin per block. Or whether a combination of other events occur and each block contains 12+ bitcoin of aggregate transaction fees.
By the time the final bitcoin is rewarded, it is expected that the other earnings within each block will be much greater than that 1 bitcoin or fraction of a bitcoin. This helps ensure that bitcoin will continue flowing through its economy.

The risk is that the current blockchain has a popular but poor implementation that results in the value becoming worthless. The improper random generator in java was a good example, although it was quickly fixed and caused no noticeable selloff, some people's wallets were drained completely before it was fixed. Unattractive to store value in something where that can happen, where its unknown what the next issue will be.
For other reasons, several hard forks in the future are practically inevitable with any modest amount of proliferation.

@_date: 2013-09-03 04:25:42
It doesn't matter how much you talk about it, YES a large seller can distort the exchange rate of bitcoin.
If there is demand for bitcoin the price won't be distorted much or for long.
There is a known and limited amount of bitcoin and this is different from any other currency or commodity (not stocks though). With other currencies, there are only estimates of what is in circulation and only assumptions about what the state will do to combat inflation or deflation. With commodities there are assumptions about how finite a resource is, until an additional resource of it is found and bottoms out the market until demand catches up. With bitcoin, everyone knows everything and after a large seller distorts the market, demand will quickly adjust the price with buying pressure. Speculators will get shaken out.
You can be independent of the exchange rate via futures, and the obvious: buying/selling bitcoin priced things that do not require fiat economies. Its easy not to worry about the exchange rate when you aren't a speculator, but just admit to yourself that you are.

it won't impact transaction times so adversely....
this exact scenerio has happened in Terracoin, where an ASIC jumped on the network and bumped difficulty really high then left, leaving difficulty too high for any transactions to be processed.
with bitcoin, if difficulty was high and a large portion of the network stopped mining, this would increase block times by maybe 2, or 3, hardly disastrous

they buy bitcoin before their user's funds reach them... if the price changes too much in the mean time, coinbase will call it a "high risk" transaction, which really means its too high risk for coinbase to lose that much profit or eat that big of a loss, and not some anti-money-laundering policy. in this case, too many users would be labelled high risk, so coinbase just cut off buying for the time being.
also, they could run out of capital to buy. equally as plausible.

@_date: 2013-11-30 18:48:45
better infrastructure
given bitcoin's small market cap right now, it isn't worth it yet to create things that require state by state licenses in the US or other jurisdictions, for example. So as it snowballs to higher market caps by speculation, other services become feasible.
chicken and egg problem thats slowly sorting itself out

It was fun for two months, coinbase.
Now back to my local traders and the various exchanges which have now improved their services to US citizens. (btc-e wire deposits)
Its funny how there is always at least one bitcoin exchange available to pick up the slack, at exactly the convenient time the other one starts to fail.

you sell futures.
futures contracts use terms like "margin" and "leverage".
You can sell bitcoin futures with putting only 25% of the principle down.
Want to sell the value of 10 bitcoins? you only have to have 2.5 bitcoins in your account.
In comparison, in other markets, like futures on the S&amp;P500 you only have to put down 1%, but the S&amp;P500 isn't as volatile as bitcoin
@_date: 2013-06-21 19:32:56
its true, but I would like to add that I keep up with my contacts outside of localbitcoins so I don't have to deal with that company, or the ghetto web of trust site that like 10 bitcoiners treat as the gospel

There would have to be a state sanctioned reason to keep the difficulty high, or a state sanctioned reason why the difficulty cannot drop, like the threat of a different state taking over the network via 51% leaving a hard fork with allied powers as the only recourse (and affecting the exchange rate of the base chain and the resulting chains).
This would be the only reason to prompt the majority of network participants to mine unprofitably

They are closing retail and business accounts that have any association with bitcoin and bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:24:13
because those services aren't tied to exchanges with the higher bitcoin price
guess what.... and thats because people can withdraw faster
Mt Gox is trading the equivalent of bitcoin futures. Because people are speculating on the future price of bitcoin, where other exchanges have a current price that people can actually use.

this is an educational problem, not an inherent bitcoin problem.
a real bitcoin problem right now is that sometimes transactions have to be rebroadcast with some clients, and you may not know if your client is one of them after a few software updates down the road.
some casino sites like bitzino credit you suprisingly fast, even before a confirmation occurs. in person commerce can happen this way too.
to mitigate risk, the infrastructure can be improved with insurance companies or methods, that allow a merchant to rely on an unconfirmed transaction, but then get reimbursed the few times something doesn't go through, or is double spent or something.

@_date: 2013-09-02 22:12:10
a) stocks, bonds, options and futures on cryptocurrency stock exchanges
this is where the most inflow of capital will come from, in any capitalist economy
 ,  
b) products produced by publicly traded companies on the cryptocurrency stock exchanges
that currently is mostly machines to secure more bitcoins
c) then in a stereotypical "trickle-down" way, you can also buy most easily other intangible goods or things generally created out of thin air that don't rely on the fiat economy:
- domain names
- hosting
- business incorporation services
- legal services
- forum accounts
- escrow services
d) then there are the links to the fiat economies that let you buy tangible goods with bitcoin through conversion services like bitpay
- Gyft - lets you buy gift cards for many many many businesses like Amazon, Facebook, Starbucks, with bitcoin. Basically exchanging one stored value system, for another stored value system
- Coinsfortech.com is running its advertisements today
- many other sites are offering tangible goods with direct bitcoin to usd conversion
e) Brick and Mortar places accepting bitcoin. Time to get off the internet, but these places are few and far between. No national or international brick and mortar accepts bitcoin as of time of writing.
f) Food and rent. Its possible in case anyone asks, those two things are the go to criticisms that bitcoin critics will think of as things you distinctively can't do with bitcoin. You might just need to do a little negotiating.

refinement 2:
encrypted wallet.dat stored in dropbox or similar cloud service.
when instructions are sent from your card swipe to initiate a transaction, the POS sends a request to download the wallet.dat file in the cloud, this api call creates a new wallet.dat with a new address and private key and sends the public key as well as the first wallet.dat with the latest encrypted password to the POS.
The consumer uses their one-time authentication generated on their credit card to unlock the wallet.dat and authorize the transaction. Malicious POS software may have access to your current wallet.dat's private key, so change is automatically sent to the additional publickey in the api request. 
On your next transaction you'll be pulling from the latest wallet.dat file, rinse and repeat.

changing the depositor to an investor is a frightening dynamic BASED ON HOW BANKS ARE RUN TODAY
***BUT*** I think it will cause customers to demand more accountability and choose banks based on solvency instead of how convenient the ATM locations are, which will be better for everyone, and it will remove the burden from the taxpayer
I think this is better for banks in the future, but for today it is very scary.

okay, so start mass producing casascius coins which can be bought for $50, they come with an address which has no coins in it. Address alone doesn't equal transmission of funds via third party.
fund the coins on demand of the bearer. problem solved. IE. the bearer has an infinite number of addresses and CHOSE the one on the coin as the destination address.
I would buy casascius coins for their novelty.

no, just no. this approach is all wrong. 
you need to send the senate finance committee SCENARIOS about how commerce has been improved, and then mention how it is facilitated by bitcoin
you need to send the senate joint economic committee SCENARIOS about how the Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't need to have a zillion reports to determine the state of a blockchain based economy because everything is analyzable
sending anything that starts off with "Bitcoin by bitcoiners" is doomed, this tl;dr document making the waves today is not the way to advance
this is a lot more distressing to me, because I would like to write these things, and plan to, but now I see the current way that people are upvoting and I know the result will just be a bad taste in people's mouths about some fringe group with a cause. There is always a fringe group with a cause near the capital building.

Rosenblum got fired for crying wolf. The Michigan survey of consumers is an economic indicator going out, it is not information about a private company, information about a security or anything that you would want to be caught giving financial advise on! Nobody recommends trading on indicators, without 3 pages of disclaimers removing liability for spouting bullshit.
This is not an SEC dilemma, or an FBI dilemma, and that is why Rosenblum - the whistleblower - got fired.

maybe technology isn't quite small enough yet, but how about the card can reveal holographic one-time use codes upon recognizing your fingerprint (which happens while you hold the card getting ready to swipe it)
The swipe itself sends instructions to pull your encrypted wallet.dat file to the POS, your use the one-time code to open your wallet.dat file on the POS, and authorize the transfer of bitcoins. 
Your wallet.dat is automatically encrypted again after that. synced with your cloud version, and deleted from the POS. Even if it wasn't deleted from the POS, it is encrypted. Or the change can be sent to a brand new address you control, that was generated in a different wallet. This way the POS is never given the opportunity to get the private key for your coins, if the software was malicious.

Yes, I understand that
now lets repeat my question, would you spent more energy encrypting a wallet full of addresses or simultaneously just one the private keys of an address
