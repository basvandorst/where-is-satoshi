I had a similar problem but I got lucky. I have payed for around 45 coins in total and my balance is at 120 from martingale on bitbattle. What i did when i hit 120 is i created a paper wallet from   then i have this wallet stored in a folder. It is much less tempting to use the coins then just being in a wallet on your computer. Another step you could take is put the paper wallet in a trusted family members house or safe deposit box. With the paper wallet you cant spend the coins without the private key printed on there. I suggest you do this ASAP before you lose them.

Down $10 so far on bitstamp.. $115
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:36:46
Silk road gone, it will be under $50 soon
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:40:50
If you are looking to buy, your hoping silk road goes down permanently then you can get back under $50
@_date: 2013-04-26 07:39:21
Lots of people say this, it seems if they rise up in value after you put your order in they will cancel. If you buy and it drops then they will give it to you
@_date: 2013-04-25 11:22:59
After you generate your codes and print your paper wallet, log into your blockchain account then go to import then in the watch only address type in your public key from the paper address. This way you will be able to view the balance on the address without comprimising it. If you ever want to send from the paper then go to custom send and choose the paper address and when you go to send it will ask for your private key for that address, thats where you can type it in. Once you have done this you can cosider the paper comprimised so I would make a new secure paper after you use it once. (Using a pc here)
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:21:58
I would be interested if I could also pay a fee for you to assemble them for me
@_date: 2013-04-25 10:57:52
So to check a balance on your account you only need to be paired with a public address. If you want to send bitcoins from a paper wallet the blockchain.info app allows you to scan the private QR code if you have one but i think if you just want to type it in you will have to do it online.

Im thinking people aren't going to panic as much as before, im in two minds, i bought in at $88 for a considerable amount before so I don't want to see it go down but then again if it does I would like to buy more lol
@_date: 2013-05-03 04:46:06
you sound like you havn't bought and traded shares before, you would be feeling guilty every week of your life
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:36:18
yes paper wallet is secure as long you keep it in a safe place
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:15:21
Something like this could be good, fireproof document bag

Ah.. been down for a while now, unfortunately the ddos attacker may make money again this time.. sell before attack and buy after =( hope not too many people panic and are learning from previous examples
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:20:43
Just just put your sell order in at a certain price then if it reaches that price it automatically sells if it doesnt then the order remains open untill you cancel it
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:12:08
Yeah I know thats why i said I got lucky, I too have a gambling problem and bitcoin makes it so easy but since i have transferred it to a paper wallet I haven't touched it which is great
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:40:26
doesnt sound like the most secure idea
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:35:57
When i try open it with multibit it says there were missing dates have to go back to genesis block but then i dont see the program doing anything?

@_date: 2013-04-25 16:56:21
lol sure if you break it down to 5 letter parts then memorise them all but then what if you forget a part one day? Much better idea to make a paper wallet
@_date: 2013-10-05 06:38:18
I guess what im really asking is do you think coins will be worth at least $135 in 6 months? This would mean my fees and interest for the period would be covered by the increase in price
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:24:45
So you print out your paper wallet which has a public address and a private key. You send funds from another address to the paper address, the blockchain confirms this. Then if you ever need to send funds from the paper wallet you just use the private key which is printed on there. The funds transferred to the public address there have already been confirmed in the block chain.

  is a better alternative

I use bit innovate in AU but their fees are only a bit smaller than spendbitcoin. If you want mt gox type fees you are going to have to do a bank transfer and wait a while

Before June 30 it will definately hit 100 again, probably sooner of course

You musn't watch that much because there are often much bigger transfers
