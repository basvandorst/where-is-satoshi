The U.S. dollar is backed by the production power and assets of the United States. It's not backed by nothing. I understand this is a bitcoin subreddit but some education on these topics would go far for some people.

Yeah, this is a bitcoin subreddit so expect to see people who are wildly inaccurate when it comes to gold and currency. A lot of these people have no earthly idea about gold backed dollars either.

I guess it sounded like you were advocating or at least supporting it. Sorry, if I assumed too much. I'm usually timid about reddit because people will jump down your throat very quickly.

Not my cup of tea to argue or debate on Reddit. There is a wealth of knowledge on the topic and even as recently as a few years back every leading economist all shot down the idea of going back to gold. It's just an all around terrible idea and all the physical aspects of gold are better replicated by a security enhanced dollar bill. Also, the fact that we've only mined 3 olympic sized swimming pools worth of gold makes it not even possible anymore. Gold is not as prevalent as many believe. I'd take a moment to look it up yourself!

There is nothing inherently valuable about gold or stable about it. The production power, relative economic and political stability, and assets of the US assure international companies and countries that you can hold the US dollar as a reserve currency and invest in the USA. It's not about making you, an individual person, feel better. It's legal tender, not lawful money. I'm not sure what you are trying to get at or what your point is since we both agree with each other?
