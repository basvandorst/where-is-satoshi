More importantly, did you recover that wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:14:41
Duh. Thanks.

Ok. I've used them now. Quick transfer via UK bank transfer in (free on black friday!). After first trade, had a glitch  though - whereby trade just didn't go through.
Withdrawal of BTC easy (and free). Appeared in my wallet within an hour.
ALSO: I've had numerous exchanges with these guys via email and I echo the above. They sound like honest and intelligent people. If the site gets an orderbook, I'll definitely return. If it started trading LTC too, that would be a winner.
It just needs to remain competitive to LBC etc and it could plug a significant gap here in the UK.

And that's great. But is it likely for the majority of people who are onboard at the moment for the ride - and not for using BTC as a replacement for fiat? I guess it's all dependent on retailers adoption - for the single reason that they will save on transaction fees. That said, it's a brave retailer who signs up to a lot of BTC transaction atm.

Good point. For that, here's another RW transaction but this time from my keyboard +$1 verify

So what are people using instead of transferwise these days?
Any suggestions?

haha. Londoners, who dabble in BTC, with WP phones. We should form a subreddit. THere are two wallets on WP8 at the moment. Blockchain has no 2FA so is out for me. ANd the other one isn't functional, I think.
In short, yes please. Make one for WP!

Loads in UK. Just be patient.

Another vote for the seed saving my ass. I updated the client and then a few days later, tried to make a payment. Password didn't work.
Cut long story short, ended up reinstalling on another computer. Recovered from seed, panic over. 
1) Careful about updating client. This one somehow did something to it that rendered it inoperable. Perhaps test with a small amount after updating.
2) Keep the seed as safe as you would anything else of the value of BTC in your wallet. (It is all anyone requires to retrieve your wallet - irrespective of whether you have encrypted the wallet on your computer.)
The update corruption worries me a little, of course. But that seed is EVERYTHING!

I also had a bug with transactions showing up as -1 confirmations for days on end. Frankly, I'm looking for another wallet...

For rational talk, where is?

They're interesting spokespeople for BTC, to say the least. I wonder what their dad ( thinks of it all...

It won't allay your disappointment if you find nothing but hey...

@_date: 2013-11-28 21:36:53
Yes, would be happy to beta test. Thanks!

I couldn't see any problem with handing over my phone. And tbh, I wasn't expecting them to discount it for BTC payers. Perhaps they might as business got bigger but quite frankly any retailer is bearing a risk accepting BTC at the moment.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:56:37
Agree. We already have 'Moronic Monday' (for which I am grateful)
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:21:23
Well, I'd have a go... but a few things put me off:
1) Where is the f-ing order book? I mean seriously - how do I even know there is anything for sale up there???
2) They just emailed me and about 100 others using the CC field!!! FFS. THey've apologised but seriously: if they're holding your btc and $$$, but can't manage their email lists???
I might be being stupid but so far, it ain't promising...

THanks. I'd assumed that merchants were guaranteed against an immediate price fluctuation - ie their revenue is 'live' at the moment of purchase. But still, this function does not negate my theory that people are hoarding. And as such this highly inhibits adoption. Furthermore, psychologically it is difficult for people to buy with BTC if they are faced with even a smaller version of the 10K btc pizza - whereby, what they bought with their BTC yesterday will be X% more today.

Yes, is interesting about Japan, isn't it? Presumably interest rates are VERY low, if not 0? (I haven't checked). This would mean investment opportunities should be attractive to the Japanese. It just goes to show the immense power of culture.
