I agree, but this will ultimately lead to the majority of users leaving Bitcoin to other currencies which serves their purpose better and you are left with miners mining coins just for themselves and no economic relevant transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:34:11
That's why I wrote in the first paragraph of my post "UASF has risks", but it's worth to seriously discuss it at least. We waited long enough for the hashpower to decide. That didn't happen and looks like won't happen anytime soon. We should look at other options. UASF is on the table now and not complete bullshit.

It would be great if the issuer of a transaction could specify which soft-forks must be active for the mined block the transaction is included/confirmed in. This way users could vote with their money (transaction fee).
When creating a transaction, the user can specify that it must be included in a SegWit-ready block to be valid. 
Scenario 1:
If a non-SegWit miner includes this transaction in a non-SegWit block, he gets no fee. 
Scenario 2:
If a SegWit miner includes that transaction in a SegWit(ready) block, he's allowed to take the fee in the coinbase transaction.
SegWit ready miners would have no issues with picking such transactions. Eventually, they could even prefer to pick those transactions first if the fee is the same as other transactions. Non-SegWit miners would not pick those transactions, as they get no fee.
Of course this requires some protocol changes (another soft fork), but it might result in a cooperation of users and miners regarding BIPs. Miners would still have the option to completely deny a soft-fork. But users would have the control which miners they would give their transaction fee to.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:11:09
You got it wrong. It's not about to ENFORCE THE USE of SegWit. It's only about to ACTIVATE the feature. Even if it's activated, nobody is forced to use it. It should be strongly advocated to not use SegWit before enough hashpower backing it is measured.
But the hope is, that if SegWit is activated (by the users) instead of WAITING FOR ACTIVATION (from the miners), then a lot of miners who are undecided yet or not signaling readiness will switch and a majority of hashpower is backing SegWit in the end. If not, the only people who lost are those who used SegWit in transactions before that majority was reached. But that's the users choice if and when he starts USING SegWit transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:18:51
Yes, that was an excellent warning. Thank you :-)
However, I think these kind of explanations are a lot more helpful: 
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:56:38
No. Or yes he could, but that would just be wasted effort. That wouldn't activate SegWit. It's your choice, yes I mean you! If you want to use SegWit transactions in the future or not. See point 3 in my post.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:10:21
I think (I'm pretty sure) you cannot mix SegWit and non-SegWit inputs in a single transaction! If you do a SegWit transaction, then all inputs would also have to be SegWit transactions or none of them is a SegWit transaction. But you cannot mix them.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:38:57
Thanks for the hint, I just read about UASF for the first time. Sounds like a plan for the current SegWit/BU fight to come to a decision. But also risky. I still would support UASF with the full nodes I'm running, better than waiting...
The idea to "vote" via the transaction fee might still be a long time solution for the economic majority, that's worth to think about? Yes, it would not allow "holders" to vote, but at some point in time even the last holder needs to do something with at least a part of their bitcoins (buy a house, pay a cab driver, buy a coffee, ...) and that's the moment where they can "vote".
Maybe "vote" is the wrong word. Better would be "extended quality of service parameters" that users have available.
Currently there's only exactly one "quality of service parameter" available for users: Please include my transaction "in a valid block", I'll pay you a service fee X for that. If the quality is met (block is valid) you get the fee, if not than you (miner) wasted your resources. However, the user has no other choice on the "quality of the produced block". The example I had in mind here would be: "I would like a valid block AND a SegWit-ready block". 
But it could be used for other examples/cases in the future as well, like "I would like my transaction to be included in a valid block AND a block that was produced using renewable energy only" ;-)
However, the status quo in Bitcoin today is a bit like if you want to fly from New York to Hong Kong by airplane and you can't choose the airline in advance but still have to pay the price in advance. The price only allows you a bit of influence on how fast you fly (no guarantee), but you have to accept any airline the system picks for you and have to accept the quality of that airline. I'm not talking about the wish to directly choose the individual pilot (miner), but at least you should be able to choose the airline and know what quality you can expect for your flight.
But maybe that's just a nice idea/vision, but would be too complex to implement in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:13:34
Well, as far as I understood, SegWit would bring a lot of advantages for Lightning &amp; Co. implementations. But that doesn't mean, that SegWit will automatically "lead to off chain" and that everything will happen off chain...
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:13:27
If it's an invalid SegWit tx, it won't be included in the block at all, the "good" SegWit miner will ignore it before including it in the block he's trying to mine next.
If a "bad" SegWit miner includes it in a block, an old node will loose 1 or 2 blocks until it realizes that it is not mining on the longest chain anymore and will resync.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:30:54
That's right. ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:55:09
Old clients always have the risk, that there's a hidden bug which has never been detected and exploited yet. So if you are using an old outdated software and refuse to update, yes then you have to take the risk that you are wasting your resources on a malicious chain... this has nothing todo with SegWit. It could happen with a bug in the old client software as well.
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:43:44
One question, with the current 0.14.0 version, you can't (yet) enforce SegWit on a full node, right? So it would require at least a 0.14.1 version, where a user could set that config option to only accept SegWit-ready blocks from now on...
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:27:47
What about this idea of adding QoS params somebody posted a few days ago: 
That wouldn't help against centralisation in mining, but it might help against centralisation against the general user's interest?
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:58:08
I guess you got the idea wrong. UASF is about to only ACTIVATE SegWit. This doesn't mean anybody would use it in a real transaction without a mining majority backing it.
But the assumption is, that if the feature is ACTIVATED instead of WAITING FOR ACTIVATION, the majority undecided miners would take position. 
So the idea is, let's activate SegWit and see if the majority of miners follow. If not, we have an activated feature nobody uses... that's not so bad.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:54:34


ROFL :-)
I'd love to see the face of the system engineer at Accenture when his sales collegue asks him: 
*Hey Bob, we just got a request from the EU for a database that can store up 2¹⁶⁰ Bitcoin addresses along with their user data. Ah, an it should have a self-registration feature. Would you recommend IBM or Oracle for that?*
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:00:35
It might split the people (humans), but not the network. The network is completely unaffected by that activation. There is also no separate chain, that has SegWit activated. It's the same chain.
Example: You and me want (need) to do business. You only accept traditional transactions and I don't care, I support both. If you have to pay me, I tell you a non-SegWit address to transfer your coins to. If I have to pay you, I only have to make sure, that I use some coins from a previous non-SegWit transaction (probably my wallet software is smart enough and takes care of that).
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:50:11
After investing quite a few hours to fully understand this proposal, I think it's not so bad. I'm not a developer and not a miner, just a user. Here's my understanding:
1. No miner will be forced to activate SegWit, everybody can make their own choice.
2. If there's a sufficient majority among the nodes (economically relevant), who would accept blocks containing SegWit transactions as being valid, it's worth to just activate it. This does not mean, that those nodes are forced or committed to only accept SegWit transactions in the future. Since it's a soft fork, they could (and probably would) still accept non-SegWit transactions.
3. Then it's up to every user, if they would like to use the new features of SegWit WHEN RECEIVING their coins via the new SegWit transaction format or continue using the current one.
WHEN SPENDING their coins, it's also up to every user if he would do it via a SegWit or non-SegWit transaction, if the recipient accepts both formats. It's like when shopping online, some websites only accept PayPal, some only credit card and many support both. It's up to the user to make this choice.
4. It would be neither a hard-fork nor a network split. A traditional (non-SegWit) transaction would be considered valid by both BU and SegWit nodes. This means that also a block consisting only of traditional transactions would be valid for both BU and SegWit nodes. And a block with some (or all) SegWit transactions would also be valid in both BU and SegWit nodes, the only difference is that the value of the SegWit transactions would be kind of "lost" from the perspective of a BU node. But it are the users (sender and recipient) who make this decision that this transaction only continues to have value in the SegWit part of the network. A BU miner/node should not care what users do with their money. The BU miner/node didn't create that block, so it's not their money that is "lost". A BU miner should only avoid to pick transactions having those "anyone can spend transactions" as an input, because there's the risk that they create a block that is later-on considered "invalid" by the SegWit nodes, so they produced something which doesn't make it into the main chain. But if all BU nodes agree on completely ignoring those transactions, then no harm is caused. Neither to them nor to the network.
5. As soon as the first SegWit transactions pile up in the network, there would also be (hopefully) enough miners willing to include them in blocks, although not every miner would do that. BU miners would probably just ignore those transactions and only pick non-SegWit transactions instead when mining blocks. SegWit miners would probably not even care if they process SegWit or non-SegWit transactions and pick those with the highest fees.
So all in all, no harm will be caused to anybody if the users decide to activate SegWit. It's just the users who have more choice afterwards on how they want to SPEND and RECEIVE their bitcoins. The only problem is, that there's (currently) no signaling mechanism in place for full nodes to tell the rest of the network they would from now on consider SegWit transactions as valid. 
So the only risk is, that the first users start creating SegWit transactions, but not enough miners are out there willing to include them in new blocks. So those users would wait for their SegWit transactions to be confirmed, but this doesn't happen. Therefore it makes sense to ask the economy first, if they want SegWit transactions or not, so everybody who is considering RECEIVING SegWit transactions has some sort of guarantee that there will be other users (e.g. exchanges) who see a future value in those SegWit transactions.
We should only give the BU miners enough time to update their software, so they avoid picking transactions with those "anyone can spend" inputs. But I think BU has at least one developer who can do this little change for them. And for Core miners who don't want to upgrade to SegWit, I think a 0.12.x update can be provided, that also avoids picking those crazy "anyone can spend" transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:06:36
You are right, that's not what I want. I just re-read the UASF proposal again, it's not about rejecting any blocks. It's about using SegWit for my own transactions after the "flag day". And the way it is drafted, there's no config option needed. You would just have to upgrade and then have the choice to create old non-SegWit transactions or the new SegWit transactions.
So actually it's up to me then, if I want to use my own coins in a SegWit transaction or not.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:47:35
hm... right, it would. Looks like the only way would be to send your BTC to a SegWit supporting Exchange before the split. And then send it via a SegWit transaction back to your cold wallet directly after the split.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:17:04
If you receive a SegWit transaction, no one forces you to process it! You can ignore that transaction and pick another one instead.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:23:38
Someone posted some slides on exactly this a few days ago:  
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:30:46
Why is this a chain split? If it's not a valid SegWit transaction, it's just an anyone can spend transaction. Could you give an example of this "specially" crafted transaction? I think if that would be possible and cause a chain split, someone would have shown it on testnet already.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:05:38
You don't have to split by yourself. If the network splits, you automatically have the same amount of coins in both networks. You then just have to wait until the first exchange offers BTU trading and then you can immediately sell your BTU there.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:02:11
cacheson explained it in this comment: 
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:07:45
That is yet to be proven! We don't know how many miners will really refuse to process SegWit transactions in the end. If that's really the case, then well, we activated a feature nobody uses... but it also causes no harm. And blocksize increase will come naturally after SegWit activation if necessary.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:22:47
It's still a soft fork. It's just the risk of the miners who do not support SegWit, that they generate invalid blocks for a certain time until they realize that the main chain is pro SegWit and need to decide if they still want to keep that forked chain alive or continue mining in the main chain again...
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:12:03
Here's a good explanation why this approach (user activated aka UASF) is risky:
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:27:35
If the majority of users want SegWit? Yes! Then miners should exactly do that!
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:51:52
Let's assume the network splits into two chains: BU and SegWit. Then I could send my existing BTC via a SegWit transaction to a new address I control, right? They would still exist in the BU chain but as "anyone can spend", right?
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:25:05
The assumption is, if the (I don't like the term) "economic majority" wants SegWit, then there will be enough miners (= enough hashpower) to serve the economic majority. That's the game theory Bitcoin is built upon. If this was not the case, then there's no point all these people are on the same network!?
So yes, old nodes could be tricked, so they waste a bit of their resources every now and then... but this would be a minority. If the majority is interested in SegWit, they would make sure to upgrade their software so they cannot be tricked. But if you're a node operator or miner who's just too lazy to upgrade his software, well then I don't know what to recommend you...
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:21:56
Thanks! I think I got it. Not much we can do without the hashpower support but waiting :-(
I don't have a big issue with the current fees, but malleability is really worrying me and the path to Schnorr sigs would be great. So I am still pro SegWit, but the hashpower does need to want it as well...
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:24:21
Yeah, you might be true. Thinking about it, you can probably mix them. But it's up to the recipient (you) if you accept such a payment from your counterpart or not. You still always have the choice to say, sorry guys... I only accept traditional transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:37:33
Yes, I could do that but my point is a different one.
Currently only "miners" have all the voting power. As a user, I can only say "I want this transaction to be included in a block". But I have to accept, that this could be done by any random miner.
Bitcoin would be a lot more democratic, if the users could bind their wish to "have a transaction included in a block" on certain conditions. And this could be achieved via the transaction fee.
It's like shouting "Dear miners, whoever wants the fee for this transaction, has to play after my rules!"
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:55:58
Exactly. And in addition this is happening: 
So Bitcoin is already slightly losing relevance.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:59:03
I'm also not a Bitcoin developer. I hope this discussion helped others. I updated my original post, so that everybody can see I had wrong assumptions.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:38:58


Directly after the split, probably! But after some time, maybe a year, that would be recovered. 
I'm not in favor of a split, but I would prefer it instead of waiting for another 2 or 3 years to find consensus and stagnant development.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:00:16
Why should everything crash down? You just end up with two chains and users can decide in which one they want to continue to participate in. When Ethereum split, this wasn't the end of the world either. Both chains exist in parallel and users have the choice...

@_date: 2017-03-13 15:22:13
I'm not talking about rejecting non-SegWit blocks. Only rejecting non-SegWit-ready blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:29:01
Here's the explanation: 
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:26:29
If I understand you correctly, this sounds similar to what I posted here: 
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:13:09
I think his concern is, that if the network splits 50/50, then the hash-rate splits 50/50 as well, but the difficulty doesn't immediately adjust as well. It takes 2016 blocks until the network adjusts to the halfened hash rate. During that time, the network might be vulnerable to attacks?
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:41:39
But then it's the miners own fault if he mined a malicious block! It's the miners responsibility to NOT mine faulty blocks and it's all in his control.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:49:50
No, right now miners still get a block reward (coinbase transaction), so I don't see how an attacker (minority) could "starve miners to death". Miners might only be "less profitable" if the don't follow to serve the majority.
An ASIC resistent PoW algorithm still has to be developed/researched... I don't think it really exists yet and that it can be developed within a few days in a way, that it provides proven security.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:47:44
Exactly, you're saying it. It can't happen passively! So it can only be the miner himself who does it deliberately. And if he does that, he can't expect that anybody is willing to give him a reward for that.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:52:59
I was talking about the **average miner**. Question is, would your reasoning (which is very long-term oriented) be the same for most of the other miners?
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:43:14
The worst case is, that people and businesses move to other blockchains/currencies because of the BU vs. SegWit debate which doesn't come to an end. Bitcoin is useless without progress and will lose its relevance.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:35:41




This sounds like the witness is kept in the block (at least in the beginning)? Funny to call it SegWit-lite then... is there a draft (BIP) on this proposal already to read more details?
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:49:36
Seems like I got it wrong. Thanks for the serious discussion. I updated my post.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:07:46
SegWit is an optimisation for transactions, where if everybody would use it (nobody has to) there would almost be twice as much space available in a block, as with current (traditional) transactions. It's like if in a small elevator only fit 4 fat people. But if each of them would slim (SegWit) than the same elevator could lift 8 people at once.
However, SegWit has a few more long-term benefits, which some (or many) miners fear would lead to that the majority of transactions will be handled off-chain. And the problem is, that there's no fee/profit for a miner when transactions happen off-chain. A miner only gets a transaction fee for on-chain transactions.
That could be a reason why many miners are not too eager to support SegWit (yet).
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:31:38
I updated this post. I realized, that I had wrong assumptions on how this UASF should work.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:40:16

I want SegWit asap too, but just realized the way shaolinfry drafted it is quite risky. Not sure anymore if it's worth the risk. Please have a look at the clarification from cacheson in the comments here.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:49:01
I'm not saying and promoting that it would work with a mining majority. That's obvious, SegWit needs a mining majority like everything else on Bitcoin. But the ACTIVATION of SegWit doesn't need a mining majority. The users can at least activate SegWit if they want and then see if the miners follow, before they actually use it in real transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:09:16
The common misunderstanding seems to be that "the hashpower" (miners) have to vote and set the direction of Bitcoin. But their role is by design to only validate what the majority of users consider as "valid". For this "service" they are paid a transaction fee by the users. So today, it seems like we have a huge imbalance between users (approx 10 Million people) and miners (who are also users but with different interests).
I think SegWit was developed in favor and interest of the users and not by a mandate from the miners. Unfortunately Bitcoin does not have a "signaling mechanism" for the users, this only exists for the hashpower. That's why it's difficult to find out what the majority of users want.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:49:55
That's my understanding as well.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:43:30


Thanks for the clarification! I didn't realize that this is the proposal, my fault. That's what I expect from a serious discussion.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:36:17
That's correct! I updated my original post after I realized how this UASF was drafted and that I had wrong assumptions about it.
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:33:33
That's my understanding as well. But running a 0.13+ full node implicitly means: If SegWit was activated, my node would support it. However, there's no config option (yet) to really enforce SegWit on your full node. It would require you to modify the current core source code and recompile the software yourself, so that you would only accept SegWit-ready blocks from now on. Not sure if Core would like to release such a version where this config option exists...
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:02:00
It would require at least another 0.14.1 version of the core software, that allows a node operator via configuration to only accept SegWit-ready blocks from now on (or from the flag day onwards), right? AFAIK there's no such config option in the core software yet? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:35:21
But then this is my problem. If I take the risk to accept a SegWit transaction without sufficient hashpower from SegWit miners, then this is MY MONEY which is gone. Not yours and not the old nodes problem, because they are still on the longest chain, and I am on a minority chain. That is why it is called "user activated" soft fork. If I wanted it, it's my risk my money is gone.
So all I want to do is have the choice to accept SegWit transactions. If I will really do it in each case, will depend on the hashpower behind it at that time, when I have to make the decision. Even with activated SegWit, I will always have the choice to only give out non-SegWit addresses to receive payments.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:42:52
But nobody prevents/hinders a miner from understanding SegWit. It's openly documented and SegWit tx are not encrypted and can be easily detected and checked if they are valid or not.

That is misleading information and trying to "trick" people into "blindly" installing the wrong software. A responsible company would at least have mentioned that:

SegWit2x is a 20th century paper decision by a group of non-technicans (CEOs), to double the block size, without having researched the implications very well nor giving enough time for the hard fork to deploy smoothly. It's just their gut feeling (hope) this will make things better (faster). Those people are probably used to that when they make a plan, that the employees have to stick to the timeline without questioning it and just execute it.
And because they can't code/program themselves, they are urgently looking for developers who are willing to execute their plan. The problem is, almost all responsible and sane experts think this is a silly plan and are not supporting them. 
So yes, they found a few developers to create a software (btc1) that will split the network again in November, no matter the risks and potential damage that may cause.

I advice to study at least the basic axioms of Praxeology:
"Time is always scarce with reference to human action."

Wrong. Then you would end up with a software fork that falls out of consensus. You would end up with an altcoin of more than 21 million tokens. But bitcoin would still be only 21 mio max.

That's exactly what Bitcoiners do who run a node.

Here's their official Twitter announcement of that research:

It's OK if it wakes up every 10min to check if there's a new block(s).
I know it's impossible today. But what about tomorrow? Or next month? Next year? Next two years?

Very valuable, because they can trade with people from other countries and are not bound to the Yuan.

Likely to stay legal, but eventually unified:

Update: Several leaders from the temperature industry called for an emergency meeting with Chinese regulators tomorrow. It's said they are trying to agree on a licensing program for at least the zeroth law of thermodynamics to remain legal. Global markets seem to cool down a bit on this outlook.

Here's the quote from a Chinese official who wants to stay anonymous:

The storage vs size (wrist use case) aspect is the least one I guess and can be considered manageable:

It's a vision. I would be willing to pay double or even tripple the price of an Apple watch.
    fully validating: yes
    serving the chain IN THE NETWORK: no
    serving the chain to Dapps on my smartphone: yes

Or people (institutions) moving their BTC away from exchanges/wallets like Bitmex who announced to not support the B2X split.

But WHY a "new SegWit proposal"? The current one can still be used if there's consensus to activate SegWit!
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:49:38
Why are those proposals getting more and more complex? What about KISS (keep it simple stupid)? If miners want to activate SegWit now until September, they can do so already without introducing another super complex BIP like this one...
A 2 MB hardfork could be done in half a year separately. Why mix everything into one BIP and have a single signaling string called "COOP" instead?

It's a really good whitepaper. I can imagine IOTA works similar, but I'm not sure. Anyway, would be interesting to see this implemented as a Bitcoin sidechain (drivechain?).

I don't know, just asking. The world is usually never as black and white as it looks...

What I just did is re-allocating my cloud mining hash power to ZEC for the time being. As long as they don't take position and just keep silent without making a public statement, I'm not supporting the current Bitcoin difficulty with my hashpower.
That's what everybody who want's to support SegWit can do with their cloud-mining contracts. If your cloud-mining hoster is not signalling for SegWit, remove that hash power from Bitcoin and target it to some other blockchain (e.g. ZEC) instead for the time beeing. This may have 2 impacts: It contributes to reducing the difficulty of Bitcoin before August 1st, so retargeting for the UASF chain will be eventually faster. And if your cloud-mining provider finally positions to support SegWit after August 1st, you can re-allocate your hashpower to support the UASF chain.
Makes sense?
