If this wasn't Coinbase probably i would see it as good news... But since it is Coinbase they can use their monopoly to push their own price even more. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:16:41
In value compared to USD or in real value. BTC is already real value to most of people around here. It works well for many purposes that even last December were unthinkable. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:02:26
This is actually really good. I bet that everyone of those interviewed went home and researched a little bit about crypto.... and if they didn't for sure now they know more than they knew before. 
Good job spreading the word.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:20:31
Amazing. Thank you. I was looking for something like this for a while.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:00:55
True. Unless people still keep lower fees for their own transactions or the capacity of the network allows for the mempool to diminish regardless. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:53:37
There was a site also called coindetail.com with very similar functionality. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:50:53
Thank you. You get my upvote.

Thank you for sharing. Please let us know about your experience if you decide to use that feature ( time it took for the other party to receive the funds / how easy was to upload your balance / how long did it take to cash out / do they offer exchange mechanisms  / ease of use etc. )
Thank you
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:23:17
Yes. Looks like a biased article overall.. I might be wrong though
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:20:55
This is great news. Thx for the explanation.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:49:06
Yes it does. You selling BTC would be the easy part. The hard part would be having the actual platform including invoicing / accounting / wallet creation and everything done within a website. 
BitPay basically charges a very high fee just to exchange btc to fiat. You can do that at way of a lower cost. In other words i am sure that anyone on this forum would gladly exchange your btc made using BTCPay at a lower fee than Bitpay lol. :)
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:26:12
Any stats for the beta on mainnet?
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:11:15
Where is that 19% from? I am still seeing 11-12%. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:43:11
They say it was completed in BTC but that they are looking to launch their own cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:34:32
Without LN this makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:23:59
I don't see any mention of an altcoin for Stripe. Also they are talking positively about BTC ( )
"Stripe says it remains optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency. Karlo specifically pointed to the Lightning network—a payment network layered on top of bitcoin that could address bitcoin's scalability and cost problems—as an experiment Stripe is watching. But Lightning is still in its infancy, so it's not ready for use by a mainstream payment processor like Stripe."
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:47:48
This is actually the best news of the day. Please spread the word to merchants that have or plan to have stores online. Integration is seamless and it just adds to their marketing campaign. Also prepares them for the future of LND.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:17:08
Up-voted for visibility. There was a time this is what this forum was all about.

yes but still on testnet. I am looking for the mainnet one....
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:24:20
Less spam...
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:20:07
I am surprised this doesn't get more attention within the global media. Beside the actual BTC use case it undermines and creates a precedent in replacing USD as the "defacto" international goods trade currency. Slowly the empire is eroding. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:12:51
Title is misleading and biased. The actual news, still highly positive is that Brisbane Airport announced the World’s First Cryptocurrency Terminal with TravelbyBit. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:48:03
Is there an explorer like the testnet one so we can see all nodes?
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:48:49
What are your core skills? Can you design or market? Maybe trying by yourself to set a node and then initiate a payment would allow you to be in front line to lobby this to small convenience stores and friends.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:25:30

My "growth graph" is based on the advancements in the btc tech. And that graph looks quite impressing lately. If the price went up like crazy when there was a 2 year prolonged infighting with almost a deadlock on new tech than I don't think now the price really reflects any kind of reality. I look at BTC from the value point of view and not on how it compares to some currency I don't find expressing in a very good way the value of things around the globe...
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:18:37
So where is the actual info about the beta release. where can we see the actual stats and deployment of the side blockchain?
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:37:45
Unfortunately I couldn't find it. The repos for Acinq on github are here: 
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:38:04
1 BTC might get a lot of people rushing for the job.....
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:48:23
Did anyone explain to them the Lighting Network principles. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:53:30
I am not sure on all details. My current understanding is that BTCPay offers the full infrastructure tied up to your wallet. So basically you will receive all the funds in BTC and it would be up to you to exchange that to fiat if you wish to.... 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:29:22
Funny how people are just unrealistic and going by emotions.
We are at over 500 billions in market cap in entire crypto, unbelievable compared with just 2 month ago. We are also doing great on the tech side with finally progress towards segwit core wallet launch. 
If you are here for the money probably this is not for you. If you are here because you are excited about tech then you would see some great times ahead.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:22:48
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:13:00
Agreed. It will hit fast. In few years this will be the norm and laws / entire financial system will have to adapt... 
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:59:59
Anyone has any screenshots of the new GUI interface?
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:04:48
Totally aligned. BTC is so much more stable than it was one month ago both legally and on the tech side.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:37:36
Seems very easy to enforce:
-- Hey do you own any bitcoin ?
-- Mmmm. No.
-- Ok. Here is your bonus.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:55:34
I thought it is a trading platform.... Not only sell...
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:09:45
Still no idea how that affects the fees. Ideally the hashing power should decrease and then the monopoly of Chinese miners should break. That means that still a new block will come out every 10 mins.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:43:58
It doesn't say much about the beta mainnet release. I am looking for the explorer and all the links that actually show that the sidechain is live on mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:21:21
FUD article again talking about hypothesis and price. I don't see BTC / tech going away. Actually there were a lot of nice news recently. So the fact that compared to USD the chart is unfavorable means only that some bullish actions subsized and the market / wealth distribution is doing quite well. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:34:39
There is no official statement about this. Just a suggestion mentioning that they should put 1% into it
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:01:13
I would see this more like BTC versus the equivalent crypto of each country. For example eUSD vs BTC , petro vs BTC and so on. I doubt fiat in its current format will last for many years more.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:19:17
Isn't this article from April last year? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:36:50
This is real news.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:29:36
Are you planning to use LN?
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:41:49
You should crowdfund this app for new features. Use RSK for your contract platform...
What does the circle button at the bottom of the screen do? 
Suggestion: allow for other currencies than $
                  the O from Other looks more like a heart ... so this is completely biased.
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:16:47
I might be wrong as I am not an expert but here is v a very brief explanation : p2sh basically adds a segiwt address to the chain of private keys under a wallet. Basically it maintains compatibility with the non-segwit addresses. Bech32 is a new address format that is segwit only. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:30:25
This is in no way dissimilar to trusting banks / funds and so on with your funds. Yes they should have be accountable for their poor security model. At the same time I don't think any high figure went to jail during the collapse of the mortgage market in the states. 
So maybe not trusting exchanges unless they are automated distributed and proven to be secure is the way to go. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:20:12
Thank you. That helps. Now only if github was not down.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:09:53
Thank you for your contribution. This is great.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:09:29
If they don't do it than their loss.... A lot of hash-power wasted. They might mine empty blocks for a while. Loosing so much on a block will eventually hurt them long term. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:55:44
All that is short lived as the difficulty would adjust itself quickly. Actually now we are on a growing trend for difficulty but in few years a cap would be reached where difficulty would start to drop. Especially if the transaction fees would diminish. Ideally that would happen and then the hashing power would be determined by transaction fees and not the other way around: the transaction fees being determined by the mining power.
I might be wrong but just trying to think outside of the box. The concept of mining allows the entire block-chain to be mined even with a single computer if no one else does it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:03:35
I still don't get how this can be interpreted as bad news. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:24:49
NO source no credibility.... 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:50:32
Probably you would need to get a dev. The same one that built your website to integrate this. If you are really serious and interested and don't have the means pm me.

How do you select btc payments. The top coin selector doesnt' show BTC
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:39:32

I am pretty sure that criminal activity killed the USD.... oh wait... not yet... but maybe soon...
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:21:01
Right about BitPay. That is why I am saying that with BTCPay the funds are delivered to your wallet in crypto. It is up to you if you want to exchange it to fiat wherever you feel comfortable. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:22:22
For now... In few years this will go away as well... Also by undermining the actual blockchain the price stays at the same levels so they still loose way more...That is why alts took over :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:07:04
Yes indeed.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:57:07
Totally agree. Like mentioned in another comment on this thread actually it would be good for the profitability of the miners to go down. That would re-balance a little the mining power towards efficiency.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:35:03
CCN almost like CNN but even more biased
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:58:50
I can't find any other information or link about the actual release and how this can be tracked on mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:15:10
Why would stripe be rated bad for taking out BTC integration. Overall they tried and did 1000 things more than any others out there. Also they have an open mind and commented on the LN thread on twitter. It is not a decision we like but overall they did try and might change their mind int he future. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:24:57
Can someone please please bring the testnet explorer to the mainnet?
Thank you
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:31:33
As long as the source doesn't mention " one official " than we are good . But so far a lot of FUD around here with no real insight.
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:24:12
The score is 65 to 35 % so far. So no not taking over, just having a lot of market cap. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:27:36
Why do you need to trade on a forum lol. BTC has a world wide exchange infrastructure and so many ways to trade. Even an ATM offers better fees that BitPay.
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:31:41
Amazing news. Finally no more hash flipping :)
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:23:42
The fact that you "managed to receive a payment actually means a lot. 
I that as an achievement considering where we are now in the development phase.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:10:09
Thank you. That clarifies it. So still didn't actually happen or if it did is not official as the moment of this post.
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:26:12
Even better.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:36:27
Totally agree. This will never be out of "beta". There will always be additions to the protocol and layer 2 same like there will always be updates to the bitcoin protocol itself ( layer 1 ). This is how we progress and make this a better product. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:30:38
Worked fine for a friend of mine. Seems like FUD.

Why only Venezuela. Until moon we need to conquer Earth.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:47:15
Does this app collect any information except anonymous analytics? For example are balances of different currencies or what exchanges are used tracked?
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:38:33
So the % of tx average is quite the same. Strange. I thought the two are highly correlated.
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:10:41
Making commits and publishing your code is enough of a donation to the community. At the same time by using their ode you can always improve it and propose changes to the main code tree.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:49:17
Maybe I don't understand this but isn't this a loosing game ? Basically long term you are loosing a lot of value just to keep the average up for a little bit.
Thank you
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:55:43
Few comments: not always things are from exchanges so an average value from coinmarketcap would be useful. Also the ability to use different currencies would help. :)
Very nice attempt.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:10:41
Fully aligned that this is good news and also should offer more transparency on the actual mining background. There was little to no information on what happens there.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:27:42
Still no explorer for mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:38:49
Wow. From illegitimate way of payment btc will become legal even in Russia. I bet that "Russia banned bitcoin" game can start afterwards as well.  
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:17:09
Still why not open source it? If we are working for a common decentralized model then anything closed source is going against those principles.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:58:36
The beta was supposed to be released on mainnet today / soon...
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:55:57
That is not true. Check 
There is a lot of progress and testing happening.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:42:06
Well even so as long as there is a chance for somebody else to mine some of the blocks containing these transactions that will be still money lost. No matter how large or small the "Leak" would be still they would start loosing money long term....
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:15:09
I am more a noob in tech trying to understand how things work... ;)
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:21:12
Misleading article. Prices always swing up and down. They fall as compared to what? 24 hours earlier when they grew by 2k? lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:19:17
This is misleading. Actually all tests pass for most of implementation with the exception of eclair. Still I do not think this would make any of the implementations prime time ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:35:39
That is still through another layer on top of the monetary system... So no you can't actually do it using the base financial network and not using intermediaries. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:47:31
Well every coin is different. IOTA is different for sure. But every coin has a different purpose and different chances to succed. For example Bitcoin as a form of gold, ethereum as the world computer, IOTA for IOT Devices

Adoption of LND will not be smooth. Bugs will come out. Some things might not work. Decentralization also might be an issue, etc... But overall in time things will settle down. So no, probably wont't be a magic bullet, but very similar to building roads early 19s....

They need Elon Musk to lead and say that they will be doing it by end of year or they will give bitcoin for free...
After Segwit was being implemented and ready for few years now it is amazing on the reasons a 1 billion company can give in this regard. 
In reality everything is about money.  Segwit means lower transaction fees which means way lower income for Coinbase. And we all know they are greedy....
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:50:07
If we go to the level of comprehension then a 5 yo doesn't need to understand much but just how to tap his phone to the payment device and see the final amount on the screen. I might be missing something but there is no need to explain the blockchain or how transactions are validated at all...
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:50:26
You are completely right. This wasn't supposed to be a top post but an informative small post to keep people informed on latest developments on core dev. If you see my other two comments one was pointing out the status of Segwit implementation and the other the backlog for the versions. 
In conclusion the significance is purely informative and awareness related and not solution oriented. Even myself I did find from the comments that there was only one more ack needed fort the segwit push request. 
I expected more comments mentioning that 17.0 is actually more appropriate than 0.17.0 but it looks like people didn't discuss this at all...
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:45:18
I assume the price is bazsd on bitfinex chart. .. . So we would have to wait a little longer.

Yeap. It will be a real rollercoaster for a little while. I will just watch the show. I am planing to keep everything. Price doesn't really matter for me. I really believe in technology and that is I like the improvements that are done every year and how adoption is still in its infantile phases.

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:47
If you really understand and believe in tech you wouldn't stress. Also if you just invested moneybthat you would not care about losing.  People that expect 50% gains every 2 weeks probably are going to have a hard time navigating and will in the end loose everything to market plays like this.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:00:11

@_date: 2018-09-17 16:52:38
... we all know he was  "SUICIDED"... 
On the other hand the amount is quite symbolic when compared to some hacks in the industry; they mention 28 millions which sincerely currently can't swing the market one way or another by much. 
The main question is the amount of crypto that was seized... if any... and who has jurisdiction over it... 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:56:49
The article also ends with: 


@_date: 2017-12-08 12:42:29
All I gather from that article is the lift of the ICO ban.

Can we get the version from this year?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:21:53
There is no new version. This is a minor change in the versioning numbering scheme. Also you can see the progress of each milestone if you look at my comments. All this info is public and can be seen in the main core repo. 
This post's intention is just to raise awareness for people that are really interested in following tech and development efforts.

Totally agree. So how does this make it scarce? It is a system where the value of the pizza is in direct corelation with the value of the goods and services transferred in the "bitcoin / monetary system" and in reverse proportion of available / transitioned BTC in the system. The value of the pizza can be 1 satoshi, one btc or even one-trillionth of BTC depending on the amount of btc available on the market just like you say. The value of the pizza will always approx. be the same equivalent to how much effort goes into obtaining the amount of BTC; by effort I mean exchange rate, work hourly rate; profit investment and other means to receive that value. 
This doesn't make a monetary token scarce by any means. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:13:47
Agree. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:52:56

@_date: 2015-06-16 01:11:00
Hypothetically, the thing is that when a house values one satoshi for example I don't need to get a full bitcoin but one satoshi. Why I would need even to worry about the whole BTC at that point?
The question is how hard is to get "something" in bitcoins or its units. In a very crude way money are an abstract representation of value. 
Again, hypothetically if all transfer of goods and services would be done in Bitcoins having a bitcoin would be huge. But how would that make it more scarce? People would trade one trillion of bitcoin for a bread and that would be it. Nobody would even think it is scarce. 
If BTC would be divisible in only 100 units like traditional money than I totally agree. But since you can represent all the value "in the world" with a lower unit of BTC then actually this is a bonus. Considering this, BTC is actually more scalable than traditional money because it can cover a wider range of value and owners in most circumstances. Traditional money can't do that because they are scarce to only two decimals and either more need to be emitted / printed or taken out of the market to achieve this. BTC does this naturally. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:23:21
Hopefully this will increase the volume. This is a great solution that is not used by people just because it does not have the same marketing support that big exchanges have. So it is a chicken and egg problem. Organically if more people start trading and realize the efficiency of saving exchange fees the offers will come down to normal amounts ... For now the platform is used as a novelty way where the price factored in has the delay in transaction risk factored in price. That pushes a lot of people away. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:31:29
1000 BTC is not a high price long position. Try 100k BTC ....

I don't think there were any talks about tragedy when the BTC was not even thinking about having ETF consideration. So all this drama seems so artificial and just a way to get all those opportunity traders out. Good riddance... 
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:08:36
I can't believe that adult people still argue about this. 
Some posts above would be true if 1 BTC would always have same value; in other words if you would ALWAYS be able to buy a tomato with 1 BTC that argument would stand. But at start with 10k BTC you could buy a pizza. Now you can buy quite a few pizzas with 1 BTC. So the argument about BTC being scarce does not hold. 
This is not same as water where a molecule of water has the same value and satisfies the same need over time. Bitcoin is an abstract representation of value same like any "type of money". 
If Bitcoin couldn't be divided down then yes it would be scarce. However it can be divided up to a level where it would be able to cover the entire wealth / value of all goods and services in the world in a proportional way.

I do agree with the scenarios. But I do not agree with the scarce comment about Bitcoin. You just said that the BitUSD is not scarce. The BitUSD is exactly the same as BitBTC if I can call some subunit of BTC like that :). Since BitUSD is not scarce the BitBTC is not scarce...
Anyway, I think we might be talking about same thing but going around in circles. Like you said, let's just leave it at this. It was a nice argument - counter argument conversation.

Can having a lot of specific very centralized networks built on top of bitcoin be still valuable? Similar with he bakery store across the street being considered a centralized entity because it allows off-chain bitcoin payments at each cashier even if the main output in the end is on-chain at the end of each day.... Of course this is at a larger scale but very similar concept.
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:26:21

Totally fair points. Agree that maybe this use case needs to be implemented off-chain but still there is no current solution to it. So if a better solution comes up that would be more than fair to standardize a way to do things.
"Paying upfront for something that may or may not happen is pretty antithetical to that." You made me laugh since this is exactly the credit card model where merchants / users pay for a transaction that is not complete until days later....

When can we see this on the street?
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:29:30
You are totally right. This seems more than BTC. However it looks like it is on top of the BTC blockchain so either BTC is used to settle the assets value... and / or ... the BTC block-chain is used to validate and store information about each transaction.
Use case: exchange 1 transfers exchange 2 100 xyzcoin ( any resemblance with real coin names is pure coincidence ) for the value of 1 btc.  All this is off-chain. When parties reconcile or whenever the aggregated reconciliation happens on the main chain a real transaction of 1 btc moves from exchange 2 to exchange 1 alongside with hashes identifying the transaction information on the off-chain. 
Can anyone actually validate this use case scenario and / or provide a more detailed example?
Thank you

Well allows for the full signatures on transactions to be collected after the transaction has been submitted. 
This allows for a lot of use cases where wallets / scripts that require multiple signatures to transfer funds can use the blockchain to commit this info at different time intervals.  
I am not the best at explaining but I will try my best. Use case scenario: My son and myself have to sign to release funds from a wallet for a transaction. Both signatures are required for this to happen. My son can go to the store pay for the item and with an updated wallet I would see that my signature is requested to approve this transaction. I can then add / sign with my signature to complete the transaction. This is not a practical example but showing the possibilities.
A more practical example is providing my funds to an exchange and requiring both the exchange and myself to sign for transactions. In this way the exchange can sign but can't use my funds for anything else. The transaction would still be in the blockchain and not offchain as it happens now and it would require my signature to complete. 
EDIT from the document: This transaction format will allow offline signers such as air-gapped wallets and hardware wallets to be able to sign transactions without needing direct access to the UTXO set and without risk of being defrauded.
EDIT 2: found this link explaining way better and more accurate offline transactions:

2% is huge. means that in one year you get to 75%. Segwit was never a next day implementation. Also as Lighting is starting to catch shape it is more and more efficient to use SegWit. 
On the other hand just think that now almost one in 2.5 transactions is segwit. That is huge. 
That is all not to mention the exchanges that do not have any incentive to implement SegWit and retest all their infrastructure.

Yes. Slightly agree. It all depends on the audience. If the information is targeted towards knowing who accepts Bitcoin it totally makes sense to just omit every single store. 
If the information targets people that might have Bitcoin and are looking for a fast food that accepts Bitcoin close by then it would make sense.
So I am with you on the fact that there is probably no way to draw the line. There might be a way to show botch views.

@_date: 2014-02-26 13:50:49
Depends what loss means. 
If they were stolen/transacted outside of Mt.Gox ownership then no. they are still in circulation and they will be used as any other BTC. If they have been lost (like the wallet keys maintaining them can't be retrieved by any means) then yes you would be right. 
In other words if Bitcoins disappeared from Mt.Gox it doesn't mean they have disappeared from the entire Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:03:12
Now is a good time to invest. But market advise should be the responsibility of yourself only and any advise comes with 0 guarantees. I just think that there is a demand for BTC now in the system for actual spending on normal activities and not only for trading. So might be a good way to invest.
Again, if you do, don't invest more than you can afford to loose.

Isn't that the entire seed of the failure of the fiat money? That it is backed, enforced and arbitered by government... a government mechanism that is in turn lobbied by businesses....
See the connection?
Bitcoin is actually backed not by government but the amount of people/businesses that use it. 
If one person uses Bitcoins it has no value. If everyone uses it then it has the same trust as per the collective trust of everyone.

Exactly same like today. Nothing really changes from the current mechanisms. Also it is very easy to track each Bitcoin in which wallet it is. A business that wants to pay illegally workers today can do it with fiat also by giving cash. Bitcoin is even more traceable at the business level once each business has it's own wallet.

From the technical point of view I still don't understand how the malleability had anything to do with this. 
It is understandable that bad decisions where made during gambling. 
Malleability just causes a transaction not to be confirmed due to the wrong id (if the verifying party checks based on this). In the worst case another transaction with same amount would be generated but with a different id and that would appear in the wallet and then disappear.

The update just buys a little more time for mt.gox in my view. There is no objective timeline on restating any kind of withdrawals. It just says they will switch to a new system and allow internal btc transfers.
One can not stop to notice that all other exchanges are live already with full functionality (including withdrawal functions). Keep in mind that mt.gox actually had a lead time for this issue. This raises even more questioning over the real state of the whereabouts of funds (either fiat or btc in mt.gox "possession" - notice the quotes because there is no certainty there). 
There was also an article about how the malleability issues appeared in the network after two days mt.gox mentioned they have issues initially.
All the facts have all ingredients needed for a soap opera that got everyone's attention... :)

The market is becoming more healthy: less speculative moves and less dollar to BTC liquidity. Now the market is sustained by commerce through BTC while before it was close to 100% a speculative market. 
So now the growth will come from the need to use BTC and less from "speculative investors". That would be a healthy sustained growth that would allow BTC to show it's usefulness as a type of "currency". 
To explain further there are split views on the place of BTC on the market: 
- some see it towards a value storage system similar to gold
- some see it towards a currency replacement
- some see it as a means to exchange and transfer value between currencies
So now BTC is growing more on the currency replacement side while the storage of value side has had some setbacks in trust mostly. 
Hope this helps. Thanks.

They acted like a market vector and unified price mark for a long time. Without mt.gox it would have been hard to bootstrap the exchange network that is available today. 
I am not taking sides and I think mt.gox turned in the end to be very poorly managed. Maybe even a fraud. However at moments it was the only exchange that anyone would be able to buy/sell Bitcoin through.
Also they might have had a role in marketing Bitcoin and bringing the entire phenomenon to a new level globally. 
How it got where it is today with so many questions still to be answered one might never find out. But all this shows that either greed or laziness in many cases take precedence when you are at the top of the food chain.

Not much on coinmap.
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:41:32
Not really. Exchanges are just the means to trade. Supply and demand on exchanges is just a means to buy / sell. Yes they can mirror supply and demand but they are not the driver for it. Like I said you don't decrease the value of Tesla just because NYS closes. The value of a share is what it is. You can trade it in another way. If one exchanges closes another will come. If one way of buying cons closes another way will be found. The supply and demand is not defined by exchanges but they can in the best case show you a value of supply and demand.
As for being in bitcoin one opinion versus another does not make one the God of bitcoin.

This is just an attempt to get out of a failed fork and regain the investment. Long story short: sell lot of BTC and increase the price of the other coin from panic and media close to 700. Resell the other coin close to top and rebuy BTC at lower price. 
just a more evolved bear trap. But because of the high price the volatility is not as drastic. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 01:57:32
Right. Even though if a lot companies would accept bitcoin then at some point business to business bitcoin payments would become cheaper than using a third party currency like dollars.
This still increases the value of bitcoin as a currency ecosystem.

Small feedback:
Price should not have more than 2 decimals. 
Too many red CTAs: it is not obvious that clicking price on the top would show combined price
Instead of "-" to remove a coin maybe a less intrusive trash can would be more indicative. 
Search of coins by symbol or name can help.
Maybe adding a graph with price totals over time would help.
Small bug: when I removed the first coin I added I wasn't able to re-add anything until I refreshed the page.

Bitcoin is just building the financial support system needed for proper transactions. The traditional "banking" system for BTC is just being created, exchanges are just starting to mature, and funds and financial vehicles are starting to appear with world wide legal framework adoption.
Currentely investment opportunities are reduced at this "Layer 0" ecosystem. 
Once this incubating phase gets solidified, opportunities appear for actually using BTC on a day to day basis for things like micro transactions, value couponing alternatives, proper contracts, record bookeeping and so on. In general this refers to all areas that generate the "Layer 1" constituing tools and services between a token of value and goods.
"Layer 2" would be when the real oportunities apepar and those are day to day uses that encompass everything a fiat currency can achieve, gold can store, legal validation and tracking systems can do...
We are still halfway building Layer 0 so pick and choose which area youw ant to work on depending on the amount you want to invest, time to market you consider viable and size of project you have in mind...
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:24:57
Not sure it sucks or it is slightly more conservative. SegWit is now part fo the network and LTC dev is only being really adopted for BTC only.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:51:00

Well it doesn't look like the market is manipulated as much. We are curently at 5% volatility for BTC  (  ). 
Compared to 60% volatility few years back and 20-30% at the start of the year it looks like the market went a long way towards stability.

Article has no foundation... or at least until the time of this comment it does not. 
"A source" told me = "a bird" might be bragging and lying about anything and everything. There might be such a technique but that somebody found Satoshi can be just a blatant lie... 
Overall, after tens of stories around the globe with people pretending they found the real One or , even better, people prettending they are The One... 
I tell you that even the Oracle told me... It was all hidden in the memes: "Neo is the One". Afterall BTC did dodge quite a few bullets so far...

If miners make less they have less money to pay for electricity and profit. So the hash rate moves away from the system...

No no. Sorry if that message came out wrong. 
I am actually saying the reverse. That lower fees do translate in a potential lower hash rate.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:04:17
Yes it can but the moment decisions are made against users probably users will try a different chain... So it is in the benefit of everyone not to bend the rules too much. For example the moment SegWit was boycoted to extremes the market share of BTC in Crypto dropped significantly. When the decision was reverted BTC recouped back a little bit. So guess what? In the end users decide. There are 850+ coins out there and if distributed exchanges come into play there will be nothing stopping users decide what works for them. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:24:44

@_date: 2017-08-18 19:39:27
There is no denying. I am pretty sure everyone is aware about the fork by now. 
Personally I wish you good luck as all it matters is for the market cap to increase and adopotion to get better. Mining monopol or controlled code updates will sooner or later express the need for decentralization but, as China proved politically, that type of polotical system can work for years as well. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:17:52
Agree. However the goal is not to compete with Bitmain's ASICs but to have a starting point that anyone can improve on.
Also are you refering at ASICBOOST? It was my impresion that with SegWit that doesn't work anymore...
@_date: 2018-10-18 12:35:02
The price went up. A lot of these consumption improvements were factored in the price when it spiked from under 1k to where it is now. Bitcoin is now at the point where it passes quite a few fiat currencies market cap.
If you were looking for BTC to double every few months then probably you will be disappointing. Also if you consider that 1 month spike to almost 20k which was based on low volume and market manipulation.
In general if you take those outliers out the overall value is increasing slowly.
Keep in mind that technologies like lighting network or news regarding Bakkt are just examples of things that are still under incubation and will probably take off next year. This year was a year of technological progress and gaining stability. This is what is much more valuable than a quick unfounded price spike.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:37:52

Something like: 
1. Segwit activation
2. Segwit wallet development
3. LN implementaiton 
etc. But not sure what everyone things that the main effort will be in getting this streamlined. 
The final goal is to have tens of thousands of transactions per second seamlessly. So what is the road to get there ?

Nobody stops "banks" ( coinbase for example )  or any other services to provide insurance on top of the bitcoin network. So basically for them to act as guarantee on some services. Even more if you look at OpenBazaar they even have a better solution which is multisig escrow bitcoin addresses (  ). 
As for cashback, in my opinion, that is again a scam. basically they give you money back from the interest and taxes they get from the sellers. If those taxes and inteerest would not exist the actual price of the product you are buying should be theoretically cheaper anyway ( and way cheaper than the cashback you receive ). Even though, as mentioned before, nobody stops any financial institution to build the same service on top of the bitcoin network.

Indeed it is. This speculation brings some insight and it doesn't affect the market price. 
However investment of 3-6 billion in currency market in a matter of a half hour ( what happened yesterday ) needs a big player with lots or resources. Unless that is a state there is "the speculation" that it is a big capital market player. And if that is the case then those money come from adifferent market where those money were being held...

OpenBazaar is doing great. This was never a one week project. The amount of dedication, planning, careful testing these guys putinto the prject is simply unbelievable. This is a project that will take still months if not years to be ready for prime time but from what we see now it deserves all attention. The system is not used now because of the volatility of BTC but the market is starting to mature. With LN and SW BTC gets closer to a proper fiat replacement and so OpenBazaar becomes useful.

Giving money to ppl with "less-than-stellar" scores speeds up the downfall of FIAT:


**Update:** Reworded quote intro / Grammar corrections
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:52:21
The title is somewhat misleading. At the time of writing this comment the key Wallet released on Samsung Galaxy Store does NOT have an option to add a BTC wallet. The only piece updated so far is the SDK which suggests that in the near future (hours, days, weeks) the key wallet will support BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:36:46
There are futures now but not settled in actual crypto. Basically the existing futures use only FIAT to initiate and settle them. So no crypto is being injected in this process at any time. 
The new set of futures require the buyer and seller to actually execute a trade of actual crypto at the agreed price... This means that there needs to be both crypto and fiat deposits of some type in each account participating for the duration of the contract. Depending on the volume this can add a substantial amount of crypto being locked for the duration of the contract.
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:44:43

Even if this is a far analogy BITCOIN = USD , LightingNetwork = Visa
Visa is a layer on top of the currency and is centralized. LN can do exactly what Visa does and actually way better. 
At low level Bitcoin validates all transactions while on the Visa chanell all transactions are assumed correct froms tart because Visa vouches for them. If LN is implemented whoever set-up the channel takes VIsa's role...

@_date: 2019-08-16 16:58:04
Because these are settled in BTC it might help establish BTC as a financial trading mean slowly eating on the USD from this perspective. 
Overall yes you are probably right but if it is an open market everyone should be free to buy / sell as they wish. In order for the price manipulation to work there is a loss for every win. Cash flow is cash flow and increasing the cash flow in the BTC economy would help tremendously.

If it was useless information people wouldn't pay to paint it. However you can overwrite any pixel so having a history of how the drawing progressed would be nice. anyway a transaction is done over LN so that transaction might be able to contain information on what was painted and where.

Energy growth for mining bitcoin is based on the desire of miners to get a bigger percentage of the pie. At some point there is a cap that will be reached. Past that point hash-rate will start to drop slowly until a proper balance will be reached.
In short by design there can be only one computer mining btc to sustain the entire network. Of course that will never happen again. But the high energy cost is driven by this desire to increase your hashrate continuously. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:30:01
This is nice but what about the general public ... people that just want to learn and are enthusiastic about the future. Or the kids and outside of tech folks that just want to listen to enthusiastic speeches and understand from ground up what this entire thing is?
I got lucky to have a tech background and read about BTC a long time ago but on the Marketing side, for the "unusual suspects" there is a lot of information but all is unstructured... sometimes even containing lots of unrealistic facts.
The best marketing we have now is word of mouth and don't get me wrong, this will be the best for a long time... But a structured TED like talking guide can help. :)

A lot of wallets have over 21 coins... and you don't need a signing key. you just need a specific transaction from that wallet to a specific address ( membership ) to know that the specific credentials work.

How is this fake? I don't agree with CNN as a news hub and yes it provides a lot of fake news... However this article seems pretty decent and unbiased.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:51:56
You are assuming all coins are being sold for cash daily.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:18:47
Hence the scaling debate. 
Only one block can be validated at that interval ( again that is an average ) . If millions of transactions are in the queue then they would increase the mempool and wait to be validated. Priority would have transactions with a higher transaction fee. 
Before Segwit all blocks were capped at 1MB. Now almost all blocks go over that size. So more transactions are being fit in one block. Other improvements like Schnorr signatures ( ) would further increase the amount of transactions in one block. 
Also, keep in mind that increasing the block size is a solution that would be taken long term once the other scaling technical efficiency would have been properly implemented.
One more important point is that Lighting Network is supposed to shift a lot of transactions ( the ones small in value ) to the second layer. This is how the banking system works now having one system for large transactions and using a second layer for second transactions. We are just building that second layer. There is also the third layer that allows for insurance and transaction replay ( in the form of VISA or Mstercard  in the real banking system ) . That will come as well after we have a solid base.
For now consider BTC as a store of value. One that is in the process of getting distributed to the population. It resembles more like gold now than an actual currency. That will happen as well but we are not there yet. Exponential growth has its challenges and BTC so far over came them with brio.

lnd development is going full steam ahead. Here is the link:  
Also Eclair (which is a LN wallet) has had few updates lately.
Segwit is growing again and Electrum was just launched with version 3.0. 
Bitcoin Core is following its normal release process and if you go to their github you can see many updates since last release. Expect 0.15.0.2 to come  right after the fork. 
OpenBazaar just exited beta and now people can set-up stores and sell stuff more privately than ever. It is up to us to increase this market as well to help with adoption.
Legally there are more than 50 bills in different countries that affect crypto and clarify the legal status. 
Announcements from more and more financial monsters about crypto adoption and integration is also increasing 
In short things are moving in the right direction but some of these technical advancements take months if not years. Rigorous testing and careful planing got us where we are today so jumping the gun can be dangerous. 
EDIT: OpenBazaar 2.0 is live and not beta as per the comments bellow.

Any currency Amazon creates leads to a controlled ecosystem. Crypto / BTC are inherently distributed and do not depend on a central issuer.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:33:12
Right to the point.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:36:17
Bitcoin core does not give a timeline for implementation: everything gets launched only after it is ready and after careful testing. However you can see scheduled changes to the Bitcoin Core wallet based on their tagging list (  ) . This list can be changed if something is not ready for a specific release.
In other words steady, carefully tested and secure addition of feature versus rushed versions. Other chains are actually used as test beds for features that can be added to the bitcoin core. That is what makes BTC so well seen as it will accept changes if they are proven safe and would not rush on anything.

If you take a 5 yo and teach both concepts of FIAT and Digital Crypto I bet they would grasp the later at a similar or accelerated rate.... FIAT is too confusing if you are getting out of the box. All the mechanisms that are build on top to control the flow of wealth are hardly efficient in current global economy context.
EDIT: Let me give you an example. If a kid asks how BTC is being created... for now we would say that there are miners who validate each transaction and every time a group of those transactions get validated they get rewarded by new bitcoins. In few years no btc will be created so we can say that there will be no more BTC created at all. We know how many there are.... 
Now for FIAT let's try to reply to the same question.... You would need to explain the FED model, quantitative easing, political control, gdp, bonds, interest and any other mechanism that lead to inflation including M1, M2 and M3 supply... And that without getting into the ins of bailouts prime rate and other things that might affect "creation" of new money....
So now tell me, which one is easier to understand? Maybe the Nobel laureate who asks for a ban on crypto gets it all but certainly myself I get more the crypto than FIAT. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:38:33
There are a lot of variables but in general the protocol adjusts difficulty of the mining to allow for a block to be mined every 10 mins on average. So no matter how many transactions are pending in the mempool the same number of blocks will be mined. Segwit allowed for more transactions to enter a block. 
Finding the has for each block has a very finite reward and those are the only new coins that get created until the cap is reached.
The transaction fees are different however and are not coming from "newly mined coins". The fee is paid by the sender to validate his transaction and that is not a new coin.
I hope this helps.

I don't think there is a clear understanding of what was asked from apple and the main reason they protest.
In a nutshell the main ask is for apple to bypass the key validation methods and to sign this "new" iOS while tagging it with a higher version number. According to FBI, once the new version is flashed on the device, this would allow the device data to be normally accessible. 
Now that raises few questions in itself. If FBI is right and that would indeed allow the data to be accessible ( fact that Apple does not dispute ) than the entire security model of the Apple device is flawed. A good security layer implementation would not allow for the data to be available / decrypted unless one would provide ( by the means of a device input device: keyboard, fingerprint reader, etc ) the password/decryption key. 
The fact that Apple would be able to provide access to the data no matter what changes to the code are required means that their iOS already contains an exploitable backdoor.
The reason why Apple is against exploiting this method is purely related to cost and public credibility. Most probably to build a new iOS by taking the security layers out proved to be a longer than expected development process. That cost in this case would be totally supported by Apple. 
The right thing to do is to invest those hours in fixing the broken security layer of the iOS in the first place then breaking it further. 
In case they comply with the FBI's request no other government, security cleared agency from any world state would allow Apple devices above a decisive security clearance level. 
So leaving the politics aside Apple finds itself in a tough spot with an operating system that is neither secure and can be backdoored given someone puts all the effort on that path. And don't get me wrong, FBI has the knowledge and the team to fully reverse engineer and backdoor that device themselves, however the cost and time to do so (reverse engineer the entire os) would be totally outrages compared to apple going directly to the existing source code. However as a plan B Apple would just need to provide their code signing key to FBI if they would want to take that path.
I hope this brings some clarity....

Nobody said volume was down 50 percent and it looks like you found also a reference time point that is arbitrary chosen: November. I do think that the article refers to the period between December and now but even if not it is misleading. 
There was a recent dip, which can be seen even in volume and that is the main point. The article, if i can call it like that, is just a FUD article trying to prove that there was no dip and is just fictional based on batching. That is not true and quite a few people commented on that already. 
You are right about the hype in december and now we are back to healthy growth and some smaller speculation games than we have seen before.

Not at all. Exchanges have few reasons not to follow this model:
  - Risk of getting hacked. In general exchanges use few layers of storage with different security levels for their funds. A cold storage system is generally used for the majority of the funds, in some case there is even a secure storage with no direct access to the network and the private keys kept in a secure location as well. Only the day traded amount ( maybe 1% ) is in wallets connected to the network. The only time an exchange would generate a new wallet is when people need to send or receive coins outside of the exchange.
  - Performance issues. In general it is way more faster to do general trading without actually moving funds. As long as the total balance is in order there is no need to actually move funds from one user's wallet t another. Even if you buy an amount of btc from an exchange you would not have those transferred in any way until you decide to them out of the exchange.
  - Auditing purposes. It is much easier to audit few wallets than to manually go through all the wallets users might have. In general this process can be automated but then an exchange needs to trust that the software used does a correct job itself. In many cases a manual audit happens regularly inside an exchange.

Hi. Sorry that I was not very clear.
Basically once you select a category to go back to the category list you would need to click the browse button at the bottom of the screen. At least for me, this was not intuitive and I would have loved to have the option to either swipe back or a back white arrow on the hero image at the top.
As for clicking any of the vendors, I just realized that it takes you away from the app opening the browser to the respective page. I would have expected to actually see a small description of the vendor along with the icon and then have a CTA that takes me to the actual browser.
Long term maybe it would be possible to integrate a browser control within the app so you can offer streamlined navigation and services directly.

Really happy to see adoption happening under our eyes. 
It is sad that so few understand the full marketing potential that bitcoin brings. Maybe the system is not there yet to offer millions of transactions per minute but having the demand ready helps to push the limits and speed up the implementation of lighting network ... it is time to start defining BTC as money and not only as a store of value.
Overall accepting BTC means direct marketing to a multi million user base. This is more powerful than any email / tv / banner campaign that many multi billion companies pay millions to build. How much does it cost to accept bitcoin? Almost nothing compared to all other marketing channels. I hope more and more will start learning this...

Yes the call center specialist from &lt;insert your favourite outsourcing country&gt; was not able to find the keyboard key for eleven. As a result, after a short discussion with the manager, the ticket has been escalated internally to TIER 3 technical support to provide an "up-to-date keyboard" that contains the key eleven. 
The user was told: "Due to internal technical dificulties we are unable to address your problem right now. We have escalated this issue internally and will provide feedback as soon as an update is being available"
After few days: Tier 3 support escalated this issue to their 3rd party contractor from China requesting the delivery of n number of updated keyboards with the "eleven key". This was deemed a quality miss in the production of the keyboards. Since the cost of this request is still being addressed between the 3rd party accounting team and Coinbase financial procurement team... the user is still waiting for resolution....

And how does that affect the end result or the Bitcoin community overall? I use many apps I don't even know who wrote them. I look at movies and I don't care what actors did or do during their day to day lives. If we think outside of the box the app is what matters.
Of course her morals and lack of innocence is morally wrong, but the main point stands: is the app good? can it be improved? are there things that we should follow on and ask the real devs to improve etc.... 
If we are filled by hate instead of looking how to make things better then we are always going to blame each other.

The actual wallet uses a very similar process to download blocks as a torrent client would do. It is the same P2P process. However the bitcoin wallet also checks while downloading if the transactions are valid and valid based on the Bitcoin protocol rules. Speed wise you would probably get the same speed by torrent and then you would have to wait for the wallet to validate the downloaded data.

I do recall that there was a few month ban on exchanges before. After a while the Chinesse government felt left out of this market with Japan/Korea becoming first in traded volume.

My sources told me that during the last Bitcoin board meeting the CEO proposed the donation of Board members personal Lambos for being used during the next SpaceX Falcon heavy Launch. The board rejected the proposals for the fear of the price ( actually Lambos ) reaching the moon. 
The same quoted sources continued with invaluable information that the insight fighting moved outside of the Moon area and is reaching vectors never seen before under the Star Trek Discovery era. The new motto of the Bitcoin enterprise will be named: Boldly grow Bitcoin as no one grew it before. For this growth process the Bitcoin company invested into water cooling mechanisms for a new generation of miners. The heat of the discussions was easily felt outside of the Bitcoin offices and generated a FUD campaign of global warming denial. 
In short, related to all sources and related events, it is certain that the price will reach 10k+ by Sunday.

Yes&gt; I do agree this is slightly different but why not.

To note: BTC is not only a payment token / asset  . Bitcoin, at its core, is a forever evolving collection of technologies. 
Extrapolating even further, bitcoin does not need to be backed by some other means of value because the technology is the value. This is in a similar way that many corporations are valued based on their IP except the cost of maintaining submitting and managing patents is not needed. 
I salute this because any type of technical discussion / work that can expand on this core should take precedence over BTC price and one of experiences.

Most adopters get the fear of a crash sooner or later at which point they sell and a new wave comes in.

There is always bad news on the horizon. The moment the market "needs" to be manipulated a plethora of bad news will come all at the same time. 
Same happens with some good news. If you really follow reddit a lot of news are repeats. For example: what happened to that big chain store in Japan that was accepting Bitcoin by summer: 
Or the post about google influencing sales, or Australia introduced a bill to eliminate double taxation and so on.. All those are just repeats whenever positive news need to appear. Same with thousands of stories involving "my dad, my kid, my wife, my coworker, my boss, my mom, my beer buddy and so on".

There is a difference between being in this for the money and being in this because you believe in the technology. If you are in this for short gains / day trading / cash grab then probably you will get influenced by a graph like this and sell / buy based on trends and emotions ( some correct and some not ).
If you are in because you believe in technology and the amazing novelty of having a digital financial system ( with all it encompasses: store of value, daily transactions, etc ) then this graph means nothing. You would also buy at a perceived "high price" or perceived "low price". If the technology is really to succeed then there is no way usd / btc even makes sense anymore. 
In other words if you have a doubt ( even small ) about the tech behind this ( or you don't understand it ) then get out before you loose everything.... 
My two cents.. and feel free not to agree.
**Update**: Few clarification points answering to some constructive comments:
* As many pointed out, the term "bitcoin technology" might be way too restrictive in the above assessment. It should probably be encompassing the wide spectrum of achievements that bitcoin has potential in... including technology, social impact, global spread, etc.; an ecosystem  ( replacing technology with ecosystem for the lack of a better term ). Yes there are other more strictly technological advanced cryptocurrencies ( LTC for example ) but none that have the infrastructure, ( legal support, tools,exchange network app base , etc) that BTC has. Also BTC is the de facto currency to reach novel obstacles and try to find solutions and compromises. 
The entire scaling debate and network issues come from BTC reaching critical mass adoption points that no other currency has reached yet. Yes, other currencies see what happens here and try to replicate proposals under BTC or  adapt in different ways. At the same time BTC is still the first to scale to these critical points and to always push the limits of the current ecosystem. Will this change? Maybe yes or maybe not but that is not the topic now.
* As for both approaches not being mutually exclusive, sure that is a valid point. At the same time, personally, buying and selling does bring a huge risk. As someone pointed out for every success story there are other tragic, embarrassing stories. I never advice however and would only express a personal point that if you believe in this "ecosystem" you should worry about increasing your stake as a primary goal.
* BTC/USD is valid now as a global measure of value for BTC. If ( this IF can be as big as a lottery ticket or as much as your heart believes in the ecosystem ) BTC becomes global and it is to succeed then probably USD would loose its value as a global measure of value. This is highly subjective of course.
PS: Thank you again to everyone that replied. Having constructive views / opinions and a healthy discussion is what the community is supposed to be....
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:57:04


Agree. At the same time price reflects the trust of investors ( small or big ) in technology. Seeing an open path towards a solution for scalability does help certainly. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:53:14
That "if needed" is worrisome because it is subjective to whoever decides if it is needed... In other words the user has no input. It is up to Jaxx to choose which path they want to go.

It all depends on politics. If hash power would still have political say probably in 6 month you would be overwhelmed by the investment done by the big players. 
If USAF or other method comes into play probably miners will just keep the status quo and you would be able to recoup the money. Keep in mind that hashing power for the entire network goes up.... unless a hard fork happens 
To that point, if a UASF happens in August you might ( even if there is a slim chance ) have an opportunity to mine on the UASF chain while the big mining pools are still trying to save the MASF fork. That might give you a big advantage. 
So hard to say. It is a bet and a series of decisions that might make it worthwhile but also might take way longer than what you have calculated.

in this way nobody can steal coins from anyone... 
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:44:09
Yes. A BIP 148 / UASF might be a very good opportunity if played right. Again the risk is tremendous until August and it is up to you if you want to dive in or not. 
Personal opinion ( and not necessary right ): I would mine on one of the pools that support Segwit / BIP 148 so then support goes away from pools that invest in getting political hash power.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:02:36
How long does it take for difficulty to adjust? Once that is done the mining will "de-scale" based on the hashrate of the new network. So, at start there might not be a meaningful rate but in time it will get back to normal.

About people posting fake scenarios just to market mining hardware. 
Unless energy has a drastic reduction in cost or the equipment to produce clean autonomous energy can be amortized fast ( 1-2 years max ) then he entire profitable mining dream remains just a dream.
Also, if you would be able to create mining hardware in a country where you can bribe politicians and get energy for close to free, would you play fair or just sell hardware that you don't need? Seriously, anyone that applies some common sense can find that any other mining operation playing by the rules can't beat scaling and profitability margins that some pools have.
All the posts that market cheap mining hardware or cloud mining power are either politically motivated or are scams for the average believer.... :)

Remains to be seen what happens after this period ends. Most probably SegWit is coming but still is not 100% a done deal.

The main suggestion for traders is to NEVER invest more than you can afford to loose. 
Good luck

Fair point. I think Kraken started in 2011 and by 2012 there were few options. Still, the concept of an online exchange is not new. The moment you accept FIAT for anything then you should at least have a sense of a basic accounting in mind. 
It is not the fact that they got hacked that shows their careless nature. It is the fact that they didn't realize it for so many years or did hide it and didn't try to patch their holes in case they did. In simplistic terms it takes 5 minutes each day to do a sum of all btc's in all your accounts based on the db entries and then compare that with the sum of all the wallets. If the sums don't match than something is wrong. According to all the data either they didn't do this for years or did hide from everyone and didn't care that money are leaking out of the exchange.

This is profitable only if after each month you sell your used baked potatoes for profit and order new ones. The trick is to have new potatoes every month.

From the latest news it might be hard for BTC-E to come back online. Or maybe they need to clean everything up to make sure there is no backdoor left by Alexander.
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:42:26
BTC actually did hf few times before. The only successful HF was related to a protocol bug. If I recall right the price dropped from 13 $ or so to 2 $ . 
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:58:11
They are. It is 7.2 % out of the 88% that signal intention now. So they might cut it so close that small pools might not follow through...

What bitcoin was missing until now was a marketing dedicated wing.  The focus on the price boom did the job and successfully spread the news to the average Joe. We are seeing more coverage by day.
I wonder if someone is updating

According to  it looks like a lot of people are using it. Or maybe just few nobodies with a lot of BTC :).

Good points. Considering the traffic an ATM provider could however negotiate a better deal in that case. Well, hopefully that day where BTC ATM can be found everywhere will come.
@_date: 2017-05-01 02:37:51
If BTC is to double every year this is nothing but a normal trend. Following that path it should be 1500 sometimes in July and 2000 end of year.
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:32:24
Wow. About time. Maybe this will get other stores to follow. I wish we had have solved the scalability issue by now :(
 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:27:43
So they accept BTC across all their branches or was this a new roll-out specific to their Poland's presence?
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:42:02
7% is actually very good for an ATM. 
It would be nice if you guys could try to partner with some stores as well ( like for example car dealers, condo builders, etc ) Also a smaller version terminal might help.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:48:31
Yes. Is there a trading chart available publicly ?
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:06:12
when people consider as true anything they read...  including a rumor that the creator of ETH died...
Makes you wonder how gullible 1 in 10 people who invested in crypto is considering that we dropped from 115 B to 94 B.
Not to mention that in reality that rumor should've actually increased the prices as probably then some ETH would be lost forever...
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:52:44
Regardless. He might be the king of an empty kingdom the way things are going. Making decisions against the users didn't help too much with BTC market share. Slowly other coins are coming up. 
The major advantage between BTC and LTC is that LTC has Segwit activated and we all could see what impact that has... In other words miners decision not to activate Segwit just lost them few billions of the market share...
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:36:02
It will not be bitcoin but another attempt at centralizing something that is by definition meant to be distributed...
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:28:51
Somehow the market cap and the possibility of any big hash rate player to switch support still seems far fetched. 
There have been quite a few desperate attempts to salvage the community so far without a HF and realistically none of them look very optimistic.

To add to that IOTA seems to scale pretty nice.... at least in theory

Did you try using openbazaar.org ?
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:12:24
I do think that someone did spin 400 or more boxes in one day in order to artificially increase the number. There were posts here at the time...

1. Before August: Price increase - coins can be split afterwards and can be used on both chains so it is good to buy
2. After August: Price drop on both chains. Everyone will wait to see what happens. Meanwhile ETH and other cryptos will jump through the roof... because traders will shift assets to a more interesting and dynamic playground.
3. Long term: Other cryptos will catch up but BTC will re-emerge as the best store of value still so it will grow and slowly eat from Gold market cap. Other currencies however will win on a daily basis and evolve into real currencies. Also probably "some miners" that missed the train in releasing a solution in time will start shifting mining assets to other protocols and the cycle will start repeating....
Update: Spelling corrections...
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:39:37
Well. If you look at the 24h transfer volume you might understand why... Other cryptos are actually eating up from BTCs dominance ( not even sure if we can talk about dominance anymore ).
Unfortunately the entire saga about Segwit was more detrimental than some though. I bet that some miners are starting to understand why working against the people and trying to centralize a decentralized system had very big consequences around mining long term earnings. 
As someone has mentioned previously BTC could be close to 10k now if it was still the most technologically advanced crypto up-there.  That is not the case anymore and it takes only weeks to switch from BTC to LTC for example.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:17:52
Exactly. my point is that no other signaling matters anymore at this point but only the 20th activation period (  ). So all other bits that signal BIP91 now don't matter anymore since everyone is forced to signal for SegWit.
Thank you
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:00:09
Not to mention that many blame BTC for these issues. Instead the main question is why corners were cut to provide cheap solutions that cut corners around security and privacy. Afterall at a first glance the product is the same ... until someone is able to hack it...

Somehow I think it is the other way around  Bubbles generate a plethora of news and coverage which in turn generates the spikes you see.

2% of what? actually 2% doesn't mean too much if the markup is high.
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:42:28
Great. They still have some work to do then to get this accepted everywhere. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:40:22
You might be right. And I don't think there is a silver bulleted way. However at least the option and support should be there for both scenarios. When you see 0.00xxxx on most of trades in an exchange it doesn't become readable anymore.
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:25:10
Totally agree with you here. On the immediate future and maybe medium to far future both will coexist. But then without the overlapping points (if gold loses the trend ) it would become just a good used in production same like any other metal. Its value should diminish somehow. Well, remains to be seen.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:37:20
For this to really happen you are assuming all gold stored value will be transitioned to BTC. That might happen but there are many IFs in that logic. 
There are also other means that capital can be injected into the crypto except from being transferred from gold. 
Now, let's think that the entire crypto market is at aprox 110 billion while gold is at 7.5 trillion
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:12:53
Blaming cutting corners around security and privacy on Bitcoin would be shameful. If you want a stable solid solution you need to take those things into consideration even if the shiny box on top ( UX / workflows and business requirements ) are all the same...
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:47:00
ATMs usually don't offer exchange services. If you try to use a fiat ATM in a different country you would find the exchange rate to be very high. In addition other charges might come and not to mention the interest rate that is actually the business model of such cards. Nevertheless your point still stands that we don't have a high enough market to be able to have lower fees.... 
Hopefully things will change.

I do think that expedia is accepting btc as well.

Segwit is part of the core but segwit2x activates segwit on a different bit. Would core software be compatible with segwit2x after segwit gets activated? This might be a noob question but not fully getting it...

@_date: 2017-06-26 16:25:01
Well. They mention that it will not be bitcoin clearly. So they will use a different implementation of the blockchain. So then it is not as distributed as bitcoin.
An assumption can be that they might use another existing coin. But that seems doubtful.

I am pro UASF but we should keep in mind that few hundred nodes were spinned in one day at the same time.
Someone can as easily take those offline so probably the number of independent nodes is way lower...
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:59:41


Not at all. I  am suggesting that Segwit / contracts / offline-transfers / decentralized exchanges and other tech should have been already part of Bitcoin and we should have looked at next tech to implement. Why do you think LTC is starting to raise again ?
I hope you are right and BTC will get back the market share it lost at some point but you can't be in the top forever without pushing the boundaries of tech.
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:59:27
Sounds fair. I saw the option but never got to use it. They accept btc only if you pay everything as a lump sum. I actually wanted to make a reservation and had to pay the full amount later at check-in. I was able to do that only by calling them and using visa :(.

I see this graph popping up every single time there is a price drop. And every time seems to be misleading. Every time there is a bear trap or there is a huge sell-off i see this type of posts appear. Somehow even last week when we dropped to 2100 this was the motto. I don't see that trend here or that drop ...
