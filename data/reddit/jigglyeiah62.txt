hey. there's actually many users starting to say this in many of their own kraken reviews online. I'm thinking it's because of the trading engine constantly going down (i get this all the time at peak times) and orders being cancelled. 
What that the issue for you and how was your experience?

Thanks for your encouraging feedback! Appreciated :) 


So your referring to what other replies have said here? ie: The cloudflare and 404 returns that impede you from place orders easily. 


sorry to hear. that must have been frustrating. I'll have to inform users of this on my description below the kraken inspection video.

Done, good point and thanks for suggesting

Yes i have experiecned the 404 errors. I only thought this was during peak trading. Interesting .. 


I've just starting seeing these cloudflare errors over the past days 


Very true. Trading is all about getting in and out at the right time. Gonna update my kraken analysis description with a mention about these increasingly large disadvantages with kraken.
