So how big was your transaction? Over 5k? Over 10?  Transactions like that require the bank to send paperwork to the IRS because of the higher risk of those types of transactions. I bet dollars to donuts the transaction that spawned this letter was over some threshold.
If so, contact them and file the IRS paperwork for it. It's normal and you'd have to do it for any bank worth it's salt.

This makes me wonder how many other people equate "unregulated" with "do whatever you want whenever you want because fuck you hahahahaha".

Interesting idea... Given they were just denied a patent.
Plan a: get patent
Plan b: corner actual market
Plan c: destroy market?
Plan d: hostile takeover?
I kid in the last two cases, but I still wonder if there's a connection between their patent and this crash

There was a guy who would have you transfer your gox coins to another gox account, and they'd transfer you some sum of bitcoins less than what you had in gox.

How is this relevant to bitcoin?  Bitcoin won't fix any of this, even if in the perfect situation defined by this sub, all currency transactions go through bitcoin - it won't end corruption.  Even the fully "transparent" nature of bitcoin can't fix this problem.
What has this sub become?

Considering folks said this about $100 gains in the past, I for one can't wait until it's reposted with another zero.
Then maybe another. :D

Thankfully my sell target is WAY below that.  Here's to hoping.
