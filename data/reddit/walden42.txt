As someone who hasn't used ShafeShift yet, can you explain how that coincides with "For those few customers who had a pending order processing with us when we went offline, we'll get those funds returned to you within 24 hours"?

Can't way for the day that a company like Coinbase or a new company releases functionality solely for moving money around the globe, in any currency, by using bitcoin buys/sells.

* If each customer has his own address, it's easy to pinpoint who made the payment.
* Reusing the same address means anyone can look up the history of that address and see how much money was sent to it, as well as where those funds went afterwards.
* To prevent stuff like this. When you get your bill, you should have your own QR code already printed on it.

That's right. If you're paying for protection, it'll be very easy for the companies to use the fear factor (as the mafias did), even though there are more "good" guys in the society. The problem is that as long as the "good people" are ignorant as they are nowadays, they'll let the evil pass--and you know that they will, as long as entertainment (TV, sports, internet) and selfishness are their priorities (as they are now). They heard about the Snowden leaks and countless breaking of constitution, and you'd think they'd be on the streets by now. The majority just don't care.


"Terrified" is not the word I'd use under any circumstance, but yes, if you've read my other posts, I consider myself an ancap. Centralization of power leads to corruption. My point I was trying to make is that as long as people are ignorant, other central powers will always come up to the surface, whether as a central government, or "insurance" company, or security forces, or whatever.

Sure, but the idea is in most cases, you won't use them, thus you won't be paying for them. You only pay in the rare cases you utilize their services. Contrast that with credit cards where merchants have no choice but to always pay the fees, even if no arbiter services are used.

Although I generally liked the movie, I had 2 problems with it:
1. Its timeline and central focus is the price, which is not the main point of bitcoin.

If they were to implement bitcoin, I think it should be separated from the USD amount and kept in a separate balance. They can hold on the bitcoin, and if not fully funded, return them to a refund address. That doesn't sound elegent, though.
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:12:39
The argument that "they wouldn't do anything bad to hurt their profits" means "they wouldn't harm long term stability in expense of short-term gains". Pretty much every large organization and government is a testament for the fact that short-term gains get chosen more often. Why would a government destroy its own economy? Why would a company make decisions that hurt its business?
The answer is simple: *the people making the decisions are only interested in themselves*, and that means making more money now at the expense of everyone else, rather than making decisions on behalf of everyone for the long term. History will show you that, every time.
That's why the "economically rational" argument is irrational. It assumes that greed is rational, when it is not.

To be fair, the more regulations New York makes like this, the more it'll become more necessary for innovators to leave the state, which could be a good thing. All we need is one of the states to now make opposite regulations, i.e. saying there are no regulations, to have businesses move there. Similar to how a majority of trucking companies are licensed in Arizona due to their lax laws.

It's my understanding that the primary use for stealth addresses is for publishing a public receive address online whose transactions you wish to keep private, such as in a public profile. A store that wishes to accept payments from others will still need to generate unique addresses for each order in order to identify them.
If the above assumptions are correct, then I don't see any good reason why light clients (such as on smartphones) need to accept stealth payments at all. These can be left to the primary wallets on a PC or server at home. 
A light client can be made to easily send payments to a stealth address (as that is a one-time job), just not accept them.

So this mafia says that what they're doing is legal, therefore it's ok? The government kills innocent people all the time, and it's "legal". That doesn't mean anything at all, just (like a said) a wording that makes it sound ok.


Same as above. Only the government can commit "asset forfeiture" by taking away innocent's people stuff. It's both legal, and only the government can do it. It is theft nonetheless, no matter how legal it is or who you are.

I haven't checked myself, but others have posted here that their prices are often cheaper than at Coinbase, so I'm assuming a good price (at least for now).

Sorry, you're not seeing the whole picture. Bitcoin's market cap is currently 7 billion dollars. That's pocket change for government entities.

Their own national currencies are much more important to them than bitcoin. There are other possibilities, like a manufacturer's owner being bribed to do the same thing.

It seems that the two major contenders are Bitcoin Wallet and Mycellium. It's important to note that Bitcoin Wallet is an SPV wallet, meaning that it uses the existing bitcoin network. Mycellium has to connect to special servers which adds a slightly centralized touch to it. Note that they don't have any control of your private keys, though.
I actually have no idea if keys for either app are kept encrypted on the hard drives, though, so it'd be great if someone else chimed in regarding that. For example, if someone got access to your phone, would they be able to get the private keys in plain text?

Perhaps very short periods of time with some clarity in certain parts of the world, like american settlers in the 1700s, but history continually shows that these moments in time are very short lived, and it's not long before some sort of ruling powers are created.
I hope such a system will be possible in 100, maybe 200 years, but the change will be due to a shift in priorities and intelligence of people, not anything else.

Some thoughts I got while looking at the demo:
- It's not clear whether I'm looking at the panel as a buyer or a seller, such as on the orders page. Are they both integrated together, or will users switch between "buyer" and "seller" modes?
- Will openbazaar be bundled with bitmessage, or will we need to install them separately?
- I can envision some people not wanting to find and use arbiter services. Will there be a built-in option to do direct payments, or would that just be via the messaging system?
- How far down the roadmap is the ability to use surety bonds instead of arbiters? And do you know how reputation would work in such a system?
That's all I've got for now. Keep up the good work :)

The idea was posted a few times before, with even a bitmit-type site implementing it, but I couldn't seem to figure out which keywords to use to find it. The above PDF is the only one I just happened to stumble upon. It shows how ebay does a trade with a $100 ipod, then around slide 25 how the new system could work using 2-of-2 deposits of double the ipod value, with a lock time. If the trade goes sour, both people lose double the item's value.
There's a nice diagram floating around, so I'll post it if I can find it. I think this would be a cool option to include in OpenBazaar for those that don't want to use a third party escrow agent.

I once heard something about there being a way for existing merchants to easily put up their products for sale via some kind of API, in order to make it easy to put up products. For example, someone would be able to use a service that integrates their online shops, such as Shopify, and automatically adds new products there onto the OpenBazaar network. Alternatively, products could be added via a CSV.
Is there any truth to this? Can you tell us more about this and what could be automated, and how?

When I say proof of work, I'm talking about the process of generating blocks by generating hashes repeatedly until a certain "difficulty" is attained (this is how bitcoin works). There are various hashing algorithms which can be used for proof of work. What I'm saying is that this whole type of mining, i.e. generating blocks through random hashes that requires any kind of hardware, has the downside of hardware being manufactured by an oligopoly. So it doesn't matter whether it's ASIC, GPU, or CPU, the whole way it's done allows for only a few manufacturers to control the mining.
I don't know enough about proof of work (which doesn't require mining like bitcoin), and it may have its own big problems. But hopefully something can eventually be found that doesn't allow for a few manufacturers to control mining operations.

Bitcoin is a protocol. The idea is that all of the above are optional and aren't forced down our throats. I'm technical enough to feel safe securing my own coins.

Thanks a lot! This is actually a great idea. What I can do is allow people to only do goals which a) have friends/family available to verify, and if not b) can be publicly verifiable by the community (like in your case compare a picture against a marathon website). The goal would show up in, say, 3 random peoples' "verify boxes", and they would confirm if it was, in fact, complete or not. If it was something that can't be publicly verified, it would be rejected.

You're not just getting better pricing, you're supporting an ecosystem that will greatly improve ecommerce in the long run. When the internet was starting in the 90s, it didn't make sense for consumers to pay $50 for a router and $50/m for internet services, when there was barely anything you can do with it. But we all know that increased adoption of the internet resulted in amazing innovations that we all can't live without today.

Any more specifics on this? How slow is slow? I was under the impression that ham communications are near-instant. 
I was aware that ham radio operators need to be licensed. Although it's not easy to pick up for everybody, I was thinking it may be valuable to have a few of them in every city for city-to-city communications, whereas small routers would be used internally. I wonder what kind of speeds could be sustained for a large amount of people, since city-to-city communications would mean tons of people connecting to a few hubs.
If you look into the MaidSafe project, they're pretty much building decentralized internet, which is incentivized monetarily through a built-in cryptocurrency (whereas Tor and Freenet are not). This means there could be companies and people going out of their way to earn money by providing bandwidth and resources to the network. I wonder how easy it would be for someone to obtain a commercial license in order to provide services for it through ham.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:19:06
Are you positive this will be sustainable? Now there might be a high cost to sign up new customers, since **marketing efforts** + **free services** = **net loss**. Don't get me wrong, I would love for this to work out, but I'm just worried that if more free users sign up as a result of your marketing efforts than paid users, you won't be able to sustain this.

Bitpay now offer free conversion to USD, so it's essentially a free service. Coinbase is free up to $1 million in transactions, then 1%. They are both essentially the same for businesses. They integrate Coinbase or Bitpay with their shopping carts, and when payments are made, they get a bitcoin or USD balance according to their preferences. That's it. Note that the only reason to use one of these services is for exchanging bitcoins for fiat. If a business wants to keep 100%, then neither are needed.

QwertyCore, you're absolutely right. I'm a hardcore crypto advocate too, but some people just don't want to look at it from the consumer's perspective. You're absolutely right that, unfortunately, the average person would need to be offered discounts in order to switch.
I hope that more discounts will be offered for paying with BTC, in addition to more people realizing that they should not support a system that supports merchant fraud and corrupt monetary control.

I agree that what you say is a problem. However, we need to take a step back and think: before the internet, how did terrorist organizations and other illicit groups organize? Probably by phone, which held risks of being wiretapped, and personal meetings. That's probably it.
Now, they have one of the most sophisticated tools of communication available thanks to the internet. You shouldn't think of this lightly; it's really made their jobs much easier. But we all agree that the power can be used by everyone, and there are a lot more good people who would use it than bad people.
The same goes for anything else, including this. Now any mom and pale place can get funded nearly for free. Individuals will now have a lot more power to follow their dreams, which is priceless.
It all boils down to this: release new technology that brings more overall freedom but some additional danger, or suppress the freedom in the name of security? I'll take the freedom any day, as the security is an illusion anyway. If you wanted ultimate security you would have to live your life in a cage.

Maybe different wording but that's what I'm saying. The pool operator may want to make $10m  via a double spend now and as a result have the pool get shut down. He doesn't care since he already got paid nicely. Therefore the "rational economist" argument doesn't work.

Sorry, I clarified my post above. Yeah, it downloads the stuff that you need, related to your transactions. However, it connects to other full nodes in the P2P network to download transactions. If a transaction doesn't pertain to you, it's thrown out.

There is no perfect solution until the price stabilizes.
There is one company I heard of called BitReserve that basically keeps your bitcoins in a USD balance so that it doesn't fluctuate. Obviously behind the scenes they convert to dollars, but to the consumer it doesn't look like it. They can send to any bitcoin address like a normal wallet. Of course it's a centralized solution, but maybe it could be viable?
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:19:41

@_date: 2014-04-17 04:10:39
Great, thank you! So this basically puts the seller at ease. This does require the seller to have a good reputation, as Bob has to trust that Alice will sign the transaction to send the bitcoins--although you'd have the same issue with or without this technique. It's definitely a step forward.
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:58:57
Yeah, good on him. He knew the whole bitcoin and regulatory space would evolve immensely. If he ever wants to cash out any of his coins, all he has to do is wait until CoinJoin is already common practice and integrated into all wallets automatically. He can then safely move his coins around without risks of tracing.

What does that even mean? Like, "Bitcoin address xyz hasn't received/sent bitcoin in the past 5 years. I'll now go ahead and send its entire balance to New York"? 
Mr. Lawsky, please explain how this will help protect consumers? I'm not even going to mention any other bullet points. This just shows everyone plain and outright that you're not doing it to protect consumers. You're doing all this to take a cut, stifling innovation in the process. You know that every single one of these "solutions to security" have a hundred different easy ways around them. You're just forcing the legitimate businesses to give you a cut with your licensing. That's all it does.
Edit: didn't even mention that bitcoin addresses don't actually have "balances". There are no "accounts".

The average person believes that stealing is bad, but the government has done a good job brainwashing the population when they do it, it's ok. To do that, that create their own words that mean the same thing.
One of the best ways that any of us can bring about a change in the average person's mind is to completely stop the use of the words that make it sound ok.
"The Attorney wants the cash stolen" forfeited =&gt; stolen
"That guy was put on trial for failing to pay his extortion fees" taxes =&gt; extortion fees
"He want imprisoned for doing free trade" money laundering =&gt; free trade
The sooner everyone start calling everything for what it really is, the faster people will start seeing the truth.

Perhaps you're right, I'm not an expert on distribution. However, whenever I see something like this happening (similar to musicians signing up with huge labels), I can't help but think that people are clinging to old business models that are rapidly getting outdated.
I've seen movies freely available to watch on Youtube, at the same time being available on other mainstream sources such as Netflix DVD (so not just the web). Isn't that the best of both worlds? Isn't being your own independent distributor becoming viable as well? Why insist on the old model?

And this magnet link would be directly tied to the merchant's account on OpenBazaar? That's not a bad idea. Maybe once the magnet link is opened, the client opening the link could send the product's info to other clients in order to make it searchable within the OpenBazaar network itself.
How will product discovery work on the network? It won't be scalable for everyone to have a copy of every product, so will there be trusted "oracles" that hold copies of all the products? Depending on how it's done, the above magnet link feature which syncs products to the network could possible cause a DDoS attack with too many people clicking on them at once, but hell it'd be a useful feature.

It's normal for consultants to charge more than $200 an hour though. It's not just the task they do, but the accumulated knowledge they have. Right now, bitcoin knowledge is rare, so we all have an advantage of having put a lot of time spent learning about the technology.
In addition to setting up BitPay and doing the hour-long screen cast, if you offer a couple more hours of random support questions (like "I forgot how to do this on BitPay), then I think $400 is a fair price. That's just how consultants work, and businesses still go out of their way to hire them.

I honestly need to learn more about how the mafias worked. From the basics I knew, it seemed like they could be a good indicator into what a society could turn into with ignorant people.
Here's the source of income I was thinking of that would apply to mafias:
When you have multiple "insurance" companies selling protection in an ancap society, that's what it'd likely turn into. The whole "it's not going to be profitable" is the part the mafias disproved, because it happened.

I tend to agree: that or higher, for three reasons:
1. It's hard to buy coins in that amount elsewhere
2. They're using this opportunity to bet on it going higher than $1200 again like it did before, so that's sort of a base price.
3. It's being sold by the government, which makes it clean (funny how just prior to gov ownership it was owned by an illegal drug marketplace, but now that the government owns it, it's "as clean as possible")

Hi Peter,
I don't understand how this will help fight double spends if a fraudster can just use a wallet that sends merchants a payment, then a minute later another payment to himself with a higher fee. Using BitUndo, you'd need to have a significat amount of mining power. Using your mining patch, this double spend attack becomes more doable for the average person.

@_date: 2014-07-03 22:39:44
I agree with this. However, there is a problem in general with ASIC mining: *because* it's not easy to make them, the manufacturing is centralized. It would be trivial for their governments to confiscate all of them, or worse, make a contract with them to supply them all their miners. This happens in other markets where an innovative company signs contracts with military and other government agencies. It's actually more profitable for the manufacturers to do so since it's steady and no customer service required.
I should really correct myself, though, since this isn't an ASIC problem, but a proof of work problem, since CPU manufacturing is also centralized. Of course changing the way mining works is most likely not an option for bitcoin at this point.
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:48:57

Just an idea, during import maybe make a little "?" next to the "Blanket Discount" box, and when they mouse-over have a little note like "Open Bazaar eliminates all seller and transaction fees.

I had to do a refund with BitPay once, and the support was excellent. I have nothing but good things to say about them. I'm unaware of any problems with TigerDirect integration. I think 1% is a fair price for auto exchanges, but that's just my opinion. I've paid higher prices in foreign countries.

This is what wikipedia says:


You're saying this and what the government does is different? Don't forget that the mafias also provided services, so it's not "good guys vs bad guys".

@_date: 2014-04-23 21:56:01
Of course it's not a precise example due to the existence of government, but the mafias of the 20s and 30s didn't care about violence, and they were very profitable. The leading factor isn't the money, but the fear factor. If they can amass a certain amount of people in their group and put pressure on others, then they've got enough fear factor to make things go their way.
You can set up private security, but like all organizations, will eventually fall prey to corruption due to the power they hold, eventually becoming a mafia themselves.
What I'm talking about is not due to the anarchist system, but due to human nature itself. Most people are ignorant, and don't fight for their own freedom. To think most will stand up and fight against smooth-talking powers is to think we're living in a utopia.

I don't really think you got a fair response. They're completely different. Storj is cloud file storage. MaidSafe is the backbone of a completely decentralized internet, of which one application can obviously be cloud storage. With MaidSafe, people get paid for letting others use their hard drive and bandwidth, like servers. So there is definitely overlap, but their goals are radically different. Not to mention, MaidSafe will have its own currency.

Another thing the others forgot to point out is that, over time, there will be more and more wallets built, each with their own set of developers. For example, there is bitcoinj right now that is unrelated to the original client. As more wallets show up, the original developers have less and less importance. Eventually, all developers from all wallets will need to collaborate to make sure everything is in sync, making it harder to implement nefarious code.

Are you saying the phone's hard drive is encrypted every time it idles (and asks for a password)? I was under the impression it's unencrypted as soon as it boots up.
And obviously it isn't simple to hack it, but someone who knows what he's doing can hook up your phone to his laptop in the car and have his way with it. As to the details, I don't know. All I know is if it's not actually encrypted, everything is in plaintext on the hard drive (including your keys), which can be accessible when plugging it into your laptop.

@_date: 2014-02-25 19:19:42
Wow. Let me point out some things that you are totally missing.
First off, as we just noticed, the free market IS working. A bad company went out of business, and as a result, 5 (6?) alternative companies came out with notices saying they are working on full transparency so that existing users can see that all of their funds are available (unlike Gox). If this were a "too big to fail" scenario, the regulatory folks you hold in such high regard would have bailed them out, thus continuing their bad practices.
Secondly, I want to point out that you believe in a system where people should not be responsible for their own actions. As you say in your own words: 


Given that information, people used their own free will to continue using Gox. Like spoiling a child, if you don't make someone responsible for their actions, they will continue making the same mistakes. No insane pile of regulations will fix that problem. I'll bet you after this news, everyone will do due diligence before keeping their money somewhere. Are new exchanges using full transparency? Do you always have access to your private keys?
Now, new regulations do one thing very well: make the cost and difficulty to innovate MUCH higher. Instead of many companies coming to take the place of a bankrupted company, you'll have maybe one or two. In doing so, you have just created corporations: big companies that people don't like, but have no choice to do business with because there are no alternatives (ISPs, anyone?) And like always, the fact that there are only a couple of companies to choose from will be blamed on the free market. "Where are all the competitors the free market talks about? We need more regulation to stop these corporations from ruining us!" I would like to remind you, that once the regulations come in, there is no longer a free market, but people will continue blaming it and asking for more and more regulations that create obstacles for new companies to offer something better. Every added regulation, every additional tax raise, is a win for the existing corporation.
So my friend, you may be happy that regulations give you a sense of security, but you certainly won't be happy when the only companies that comply with these regulations give subpar service at huge cost.

I personally would recommend using BitPay over Coinbase because I'm more aligned with and support their principles. I agree that Coinbase is good for a quick setup for new bitcoin users, but it should only be used as a stepping stone, and never holding any serious amounts of money.
As far as merchants are concerned, I would recommend BitPay because from what I've experienced and read about, their support is better, they contribute and support open-source software, and they're not trying to become the all-in-one like Coinbase.

All the other international currencies are fiat just like USD, and are heading in the same direction. If something happens to the USD, the others are screwed too. It is the world reserve currency, after all.
And the price of PMs cannot be manipulated forever--only while there is no financial crisis. It's like saying the price of food will be kept artificially low when grocery stores are empty. It's not possible, because it has an inherent value, and when SHTF, people will be scrambling to funnel all their resources into something tangible like that. The prices will skyrocket. I guarantee you that. The current gold/PM lows are a glorious window to buy undervalued commodities for cheap. Years from now you'll kick yourself for not making use of it.

Although I see your point, [MaidSafe]( is creating a new "internet", and it's definitely not stupid. The current internet is not made with security and privacy in mind, and they're trying to change that. Of course at the start it'll piggy back off of the current internet for TCP/IP, but eventually the goal is to wean off of it and use mesh networks.
To further clarify, since the current internet is not secure at its core, app developers all have to create apps with encryption, privacy, and security in mind. MaidSafe is reversing this by making a secure, private, decentralized internet on which all apps will automatically be private and secure. Want an app to upload credit card info and sync it everywhere? Just do a raw PUT request. No systems administrators, encryption, etc required by the app developer. Everything is taken care of for you.

Hi Paul, I'd like to give you some constructive criticism (came across this post while searching info about Airbitz):
1. When I learned about Airbitz Wallet, I liked the UI pictures and decided to give it a try as a replacement for Mycellium. Unfortunately, I ended up immediately uninstalling it as soon as I found out I had to "log in" to the app (implying communicating with your servers). What is the purpose of this? Mycellium requires nothing like that. Can you get rid of this requirement?
2. "but as double spend attacks get more widespread, merchant processors might start 'not' accepting spends from unconfirmed funds" I see where you're coming from, but you are optimizing too early. I wouldn't even think about it until double spending becomes a serious problem. The ability to send funds right away is more important.
Good luck!

I'm not familiar with multibit, but is there a possibility that somehow the program itself got corrupted? You could ask a trusted friend that has a mac to also install multibit and try loading your backups there.

First of all, thanks for the discussion.
Like I said, I wouldn't have any trouble at all if I didn't want to do stuff with the coins afterwards. Once the money is received, I want the service to (eventually) do one of the following: a) send the money back to the sender, b) send the money to another user, or c) send the money to myself.
Now, obviously, I'm not going to go into my database every hour, see who needs what bitcoins, and start processing all the transactions manually. That's not realistic. That's why I need a way to (semi-)automate it somehow, while keeping security as good as possible.
My previous solution was to create a wallet with a huge key pool, encrypt it, back it up, put it on the server, and just serve everyone their own address there, without the use of any private keys. The problem then resides with how to transfer that wallet to my computer and process everything I need to using scripts, and putting the wallet back on the server, all the while without shutting down the server. Bitcoin isn't really designed to have the same wallet on multiple computers.
I'm honestly not seeing any other options besides my OP. What I'm trying to do is simply communicate and automate bitcoin transactions automatically, the same as countless other bitcoin servers popping up on here. How does everyone else do it?
And I'm running Linux on my PC.
@_date: 2013-06-13 23:30:04

That's exactly how the government should be looked at. They don't have any incentive to do what's good for the people. The main thing they'll be worried about is people switching over from their dollars to a currency they don't control.

Thanks again. I forgot about the built-in encryption already there--it wasn't like that in the past. So according to your post, keeping a digital copy is simply a matter of using an Ubuntu live disk where there are no keyloggers, then backing up to cds/flash drives (where there is no internet access for copying) once the money arrives.
Last couple questions, if you don't mind: what do you mean that I don't need to sync my wallet to receive coins? How else can I send them from my wallet if my wallet doesn't even know I have them? Or maybe you're just saying I can sync it only when I'm ready to use them?
And finally: what is the best source for learning about how the whole system works? Meaning, the actual technical backend? I want to be able to program with the bitcoin network as a web developer.

That being said, it'd be awesome to have games use BTC as currency. What would be even more awesome, is that you would technically be able to move that same currency from game to game and still have the same value. It'd like moving from one "country" to another with the same currency.

I wasn't talking about joining Visa or Mastercard. I was just saying to skip making your own hardware and just using what people have already: for example, a qr code or barcode scanner (which most companies already have.)
Nowadays, customers use THEIR smartphones to scan a QR code given by the merchant, and they send the BTC. This requires people to have a wallet set up on their smartphone. What YOU could do is reverse this requirement: customers only have a "debit bitcoin card" where YOU scan the card to get the funds you need. You could use an app on your mobile phone or a computer application to do this.

@_date: 2013-08-20 22:07:17
The reason is I need access via RCP to manipulate those bitcoins that arrive. I'm not just accepting coins and shipping something out, finishing the deal. I'm trying to make a service where I send out the bitcoins to various destinations after receiving them.
My current plan is to sweep the bitcoins to another wallet that I have access to on my personal computer, and run scripts from there to do stuff with the bitcoins. That way the coins never stay too long on the server, in case of a hacking.
If you have a better solution, I'm all ears.

One thing I don't understand is why people like Peter Schiff worry about having multiple crypto-currencies. Isn't he a proponent of the free market? The belief that we should only have one stems from government currency. In the future I envision there being multiple currencies actively in use in any given country, much like gold, silver, and platinum.

@_date: 2013-05-18 05:52:45
I think it prevents double spends more in the long term. Eventually one of them will get thrown out. For example, if there are two spends at once, the miners get both, and two separate blocks get built up (a temporary fork, basically). Eventually, one somehow overtakes the other, and the "old" one is thrown out. Not sure why it takes so long, though. Perhaps something to do with the low transactions fees that are making it really far down the mining queue. Basically, this is why it's important for businesses to wait for confirmations, in case things like this happen.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2013-08-16 18:30:01
"Bring it out of the darkness into government regulation."

@_date: 2013-12-03 15:38:45


That's not really correct, though. As we already know, the network effect is what keeps people from switching. So yes, only the coins that have substantial value and enough of a network effect will be viable. But there's absolutely reason why there can't be 2 or 3 of them at once. It'd be the same as going to a jeweler to sell your gold, silver, and platinum. You don't see any of them complaining about having multiple metals to choose from, because they each have value.
If anything, having a few coins in use is a good thing. It'll protect against flaws in any coin. For example, if a major flaw is found in one of the coins that renders it broken (like thousands of blockchain forks or something), then it'll affect only that one coin. The others will be able to see that and make the necessary fixes before it hits them, too.
It's really the same idea as not putting all your eggs in one basket (currency) as everyone does today. It's really not necessary and adds more risk should something happen, and will give each coin and its developer an extra incentive to do a good job and not accept bribes for ruining the software.

Please give me an example of such a place where I won't have to live like a caveman.


True, but the problem here is that you have a monopoly (in this case, the government) that gets to make decisions on what you do or don't need. If you don't like what they do, well, tough luck, they get to decide what services they provide, and how much it'll cost. It goes against the idea of the free market that bitcoin helps so much with.
It's for this reason that the best services will ALWAYS be provided by the free market. If a service isn't good enough for the public, someone else will always be there to make it better and take business away from the inefficient one.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:22:50
What bank fees are you talking about? Coinbase charges 1% for selling BTC, and bitpay offers flat rate pricing, which can mean much less than 1% depending on volume. It's still less than credit card fees.

He really didn't stress enought the actual right answer to the question of why you would spend them if they're going up. Although the financial aspect of near zero fees is true, it's important to stress that you can always replace your spent bitcoins immediately upon spending them. That way, the merchants pay no fees, you're helping the bitcoin economy, and you still have the same amount of bitcoins yourself.

Exactly what I had in mind, except I wouldn't have it withdraw from ACH automatically, as that could pose a lot of issues. You could just have the USD balance already deposited in your account ready to be exchanged at a moment's notice.
This would encourage people to spend bitcoins where they would otherwise spend fiat, and it would also bring more business to Coinbase as a result.

@_date: 2013-12-13 22:25:51
I see what you're saying. I'll just say a couple things:
First off, on the consumer side, this makes sense the most if the merchant offered a discount for using bitcoin as payment. For example, a lot of gas stations around here offer better prices for gas if you pay in cash.
Secondly, especially for long-time bitcoin believers such as in this community, bitcoiners want to see bitcoin succeed. This means paying merchants in bitcoin even if at a slight loss. It's important to note that with a state sales tax between 7% and 10%, 1% is not a big deal at all.
Is this feature absolutely critical? Absoletely not, I'll give you that. But it's nevertheless a very good one that I think many of Coinbase's customers will appreciate.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:50:47

That wasn't proved.
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:48:41
First off, what you just said doesn't relate to the previous argument at all.
Secondly, bitcoin is still new, and as such suffers from volatility (though not to the extreme you took it.) Until it does stabilize with increased adoption, any retailer afraid of volatility risks can simply convert bitcoins to their currency of choice immediately upon receipt.

This is what Erik didn't expound on. I personally like the idea that a GPU can still be competitive when it comes to mining. This seems to create a more decentralized mining network.

Of all altcoins, it has better chances of adoption than all other litecoins.

Two things:
1. The problem is that you have to use the centralized system in order to buy the decentralized currency. There have already been a couple cases where bitcoin exchangers' bank accounts have been closed (like bitcoin24). For bitcoin to take off, we'll need as few limits as possible.
2. There is nothing wrong with have a currency backed by gold--it has value. Bitcoin has its own worth as a decentralize, predictable currency, and so do commodities (not necessarily gold).

Really, no one's going to know what a random string or 12 word seed is if you write it somewhere obscurely. Or just memorize the damn thing. It's only 12 words.

Source? I read on bitcoin.org (I think) that there's no way to test it without actually sending real bitcoins. You can just test with tiny amounts.

I don't find that to be a good thing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:46:13
If you're verified, you can get up to 10 bitcoins per week instantly without having to wait.
There are two notable differences: coinbase charges a percentage of 1% with the purchase. Kraken charges a flat $10 just to deposit funds, and that's aside from the fee the bank charges me to send a wire transfer (something like $14).
As far as I know, most banks don't have a mobile feature to send wire transfers. You have to go to the bank to do that, or have a business account with an online feature, so it's definitely not as accessible for the average person. (And did I mention the $14 fee for every wire transfer?)
I'm sure some details differ from bank to bank.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:03:50
You only need the 12 words.

@_date: 2013-08-13 17:51:47
I was being sarcastic because I thought you were being sarcastic =) As in, government created USD, therefore creating another means for funding terrorism.
Anyhow, by comparison, bitcoin should be most closely compared to cash, which is also untraceable, irreversible, and nearly impossible to regulate. Banning bitcoin would be equivalent to banning cash.

Good points.
@_date: 2013-06-13 23:48:54
Ah, cool. If you don't mind me asking, how do you plan on keeping this service up? With a mining fee of .0005 (is that what you're paying?), and a single SMS fee of somewhere around 1-2 cents, you're not really making anything. How can you keep this service practically free? Have you considered making a premium membership option for extra features?
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:11:31
This doesn't require a protocol change, just a software change.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:26:53


That's crazy. Good thing is, though, that can't last forever. There will be a point where they take it too far and it'll just collapse, similarly to last time.
I wonder how long before the situation gets that bad in the US?
@_date: 2013-07-06 03:41:08
I honestly didn't mean to start up an argument, and I didn't mean to be brash, so I apologize if it seemed so. I myself will not be using the service for the exact reasons you mention. I trust myself more than anyone else, as well.
I honestly do think, though, that there is room for services that are centralized at some point, and there's no need to fight against every one. For example, I see escrow services as being very useful, as well as easy online wallets that could be a great starting point for anyone not tech savvy (until bitcoin software itself becomes just as easy to use).
Put simply, I simply don't think that just because a service is centralized it should immediately be thrown out. As human beings, we live as society where there has to be a certain level of trust between each other. I like to use the term "the middle path". Don't take either extreme: don't be paranoid about trusting anybody, and don't trust everybody that offers you something, either.
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:15:44
You have to take good care to remember where you store your coins, and any relevant passwords, or else you will never be able to access them. There really is no reason to spread them out over a hundred different places. Just one or two secure places and you're fine.
You can also use a deterministic address (brain wallet) where you only write down or remember a single 12 word passphrase, and you can get every address ever generated using it. It's a pretty good safeguard. The Electrum bitcoin client does this, if you're interested.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:49:24
This stresses the importance of more merchants accepting bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-08-08 19:36:02


I don't understand what you mean here. Can you clarify, please?
Anyhow, at least for the very first stages of the business, I think running the client is a bit overkill. It's much easier to simply use an existing API, like blockchain. Plus, for my application, I don't want all of it going to cold storage as I'll need to be doing various stuff with it. Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:54:35
For the merchant, they'll have 0 fees.
For the buyer, using this method the positives are not giving away personal/identifying information, like credit card numbers; possibly getting discounts from merchants; supporting the bitcoin economy. The bigger bitcoin gets, the less you'll need to convert from USD in the first place.
@_date: 2013-05-16 18:32:16
Can someone explain just how this will work? Is it just like cash where I hand my whole card and all of its contents to someone? Or can it be used like a debit card, where someone scans the hologram somehow and withdraws however many bitcoins are needed?

Oh, I see. I actually just decided that I think I'd like to learn bitcoind myself, so that I can better understand how it works and get some experience with it. I want to attempt to write my own PHP scripts before I try anything else (inspired by theymos's comments in this thread today.) It sounds fascinating. I'll keep your api in mind, though!
@_date: 2013-02-18 16:31:38
Oh, so basically you just remember the key you generated and get into it somewhere else. Can you do that with the native bitcoin wallet, or only with an online wallet?
Another question: let's say a ton of people use an online wallet, like instawallet or coinbase, and the company just randomly shuts down, due to bankruptcy, corruption, government intervention, etc. Does everyone's wallet disappear, or can they access it from elsewhere? If it DOES disappear, why do so many people advocate using such services? I would see it as not to different from entrusting your money to the bank.
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:07:52


No, it's not. I can choose another security company if the others don't do their job properly. That company would get a bad reputation and would be put out of business. I can't just choose another government if they start doing the same. 
Any argument you could possibly give against using the free market can pretty much always be given even more so on the government. Everything you just mentioned against the use of "mercinaries" would be an even larger problem with the government, because they're not that easily replaced. You think bribery and corruption doesn't exist with the monopoly? Let me remind you, that 99% of the world's murders in history were done by governments, NOT mafias, mercenaries, or what have you. The idea behind the free market replacing the government is not that there will be no problems or corruption, but that it will be MUCH more easily replaced than any central authority.
Anyhow, to get back to the original point, your argument, though not accurate, still seems to prove to provide exactly what you want. In other words, the more private properties someone has, the more he has to go through (like hiring security and other services) to protect his property. This makes it less and less viable to own more private property. Isn't that what you originally wanted?
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:30:22
Of course they smash the dollar's value, but the point is that once people start realizing this en masse, there's going to be mass movement away from the dollar. Bitcoin and precious metals are going to be a prime destination, which means the government will have to step in and stop it.

It's somewhat like buying BTC for your next purchase, essentially. If you spend $5 from your paypal account, then move $5 from your bank to paypal to make it ready for the next purchase, are you spending $10 for a purchase? Of course not.

Seriously, this is awesome, and very important for bitcoin to gain traction. I've been wondering about this for a while, and here it is!
OP: Would it be somehow possible to make a bitcoin credit card, but use existing technology that merchants already have to process them? For example, a QR code scanner or barcode scanner to scan the credit card? That would mean merchants don't have to buy anything to accept them, and would only need to sign up to your services.
Great work!

@_date: 2013-12-13 20:08:46
That's the idea!
@_date: 2013-09-27 16:41:33
It seems that the bitcoin developers prefer multibit over electrum because multibit is more decentralized in nature, connecting to the existing bitcoin network, while electrum requires special electrum servers. I do understand their reasoning, but I think the deterministic factor, as of now, is more important for security.
MultiBit does, however, have plans to add deterministic wallets to its software sometime in the future, at which point it may become a viable option for me.

I love how obvious you're making the fact that it's the system that's important, not what people want. So if the current system is in trouble and all the people want out, the government will ban what the people want in order to preserve the system.
Yes, that's exactly right, the people don't want to be held responsible for all the corruption and loans that bankers make. This is why alternative, decentralize currencies will thrive in practically every country some day.

That is pretty cool. Are there are there currently any trusted companies/organizations that offer their bitcoin address for escrows?
Edit: Reading [this]( page, I hope they don't make the 2-of-2 transaction mandatory, as that's basically giving the WPS opportunity to block your transactions. Bitcoin should, by default, be trustless in nature, so any such implementation would have to be strictly optional.

@_date: 2013-07-26 13:25:29
Oh cool, didn't know about the taint analysis, thanks. How much of a problem is it, though? If you have bitcoins and send to a few addresses, there's no proving you yourself own those other addresses, and there's no way to know who those addresses belong to (unless those addresses were generated using a service that logs your info, of course). The idea is nobody can prove you sent them to yourself or not.
It's gets a lot more complicated if you're trying to hide a million dollars worth of bitcoin, of course, since it's pretty obvious you're just moving your coins between your own addresses. For smaller amounts it does seem sufficient to just move them between addresses.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:25:09

It's more a feature the bank provides, like "You won't look like a fool if someone withdraws money and you don't have it, because we'll cover you". I agree though, that it's wrong because they don't even have the option to decline this service (as far as I know). They just abuse it to charge the fees most of the time.

Yes it's better, but remember we're just starting out. The escrow business has barely seen the light of day, which could also make a huge difference. We could easily see "buyer and seller protection" services, similar to chargeback services, implemented. The only difference being that it will be take care of by the free market, which won't allow it to be one-sided to the buyer, like it is now.

Eh, till now bitcoin has still been under the government's radar. It's only just starting to come out now. The government does have the ability to severly impede Bitcoin's growth simply by outlawing its exchanges. All the investors and most business that have adopted it would abandon it.

I'll be really upset when it does happen, as it'll really slow down its growth (and it's already slowed down by the government as it is already).

Like I said, it's advertised as a feature, and technically you can call it that. It's forced down your throat, though, and you can't cancel this feature. They use it to make money off you, since usually the overdraft is only a few dollars or you pay back the whole amount anyway.

Yes, I was referring to that. I really don't agree with this logic. Namecheap and OKcupid are companies that pay a lot of money for hosting, product development, customer service, and much more. They can't just give away stuff for free just because their products are digital. I personally have received a number of free tangible goods in stores (usually as promotion), and I don't see how that's any different from digital products. Whether tangible or digital products, there is obviously a limit to how much free stuff you can give away to stay in business.

@_date: 2013-07-06 03:46:01
From what I understand, you need everyone to keep a copy of every transaction so that you can't double spend the same money. This doesn't apply to messages, since who cares if you get two of them? The idea is they will be digitally signed somehow with a particular key, and only the person you're dealing with would be able to sign it that way. Therefore, it's not required to be in the blockchain.

...the system run by the government


no such thing


Due to brainwash by the mainstream media, also controlled by the government


If there is a government to corrupt with money, it will always be corrupted. Power inherently attracts corruption. Why would the government cut off its main source of income: bribary?


Who allows it? The government. It's in the government's interest to get bribed, because they get paid. It's that simple.


That's thievery... again, in the name of the government.
You think that the government is a good organization that gets corrupted by evil corporations (or people with money), and thus blame the people. You thus believe in limiting the freedom of the people in order to make a "better" government.
Everything you said is backwards to reality. It is the government that corrupts, because it is them that have the power. Take away the government from the picture and there is no authority to corrupt. On the other hand, take away the wealth forcefully from the people (thievery), and you essentially have slavery. Socialism has never worked, and never will.
*- Those who give up freedom for security, deserve neither.*

What about mining LTC? Still worth it on a computer ~5 years old?
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:01:56
1. Install Electrum on an offline computer, write down the seed. Send bitcoins to one of the addresses there.
2. Backup your wallet.dat, or use the export menu if you want to put them somewhere safe (I wouldn't recommend it though.)
3. It's normal, you can use any of them.
4. Indeed you can, restore them all from the seed and you'll have the same wallet on all computers. They'll be synced.
5. (From your comment) If Electrum disappears, their algorithm for generating addresses will still be known, so you'll still be able to recreate your wallet. Doubt that'll happen any time soon, though.

Since when does something being illegal make it impossible to cash out? There's something called a black market. Cannabis is illegal, but I doubt anyone who really wants it will have a hard time buying or selling it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:41:54
From what I understand, the block can't go over 1MB. In other words, the miners will start picking out the transactions they want to mine, that sum up to 1MB in total. Naturally, the transactions with the highest fees will be chosen. If the cap isn't limit, transaction fees will get higher and higher as competition grows, while the network will be limited to a certain amount of transactions per block, pretty much not allowing it to increase.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:03:17
Ah, I see, that's pretty cool. So restaurants and local stores could have little computer payment stations. To pay, you would just have to go to blockchain, log in, and then transfer the funds to the stores address?
There should be an easier way than that, I think.

I see what you did there.
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:31:44
Thanks, this is similar to what I want to do. I'll probably use electrum to generate a few thousand addresses, export the public keys and put them in the db, and use the bitcoinmonitor.net service to check for payments. When they come in, I'll get notified via email, open electrum, and move the funds from that specific address to the appropriate address.
@_date: 2013-03-15 10:51:36
Are you aware that you're in the bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2013-07-06 03:15:11
Passwords are usually encrypted server-side. That means your password first has to get to their server, where it is hashed, and stored in the database. During the same process of hashing, you can send out an email if you want. It does not mean that the password is stored unencrypted from then on out. Once the server finishes its business, it's lost.
Now, I have no idea how they actually do it, and it's definitely not a good idea to send it in the email, but I'm just pointing out the fact it's possible to send out the password without storing it immediately upon receiving it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:30:00
The opposite happened here.
@_date: 2013-07-26 19:16:47
Yeah, sorry, I meant zerocoin. That's a pretty cool implementation. I also remember the backdoor in there that does something for over $10,000 worth of coins or something. I hope they just drop that and don't put it in, since that defeats the whole purpose.
We'll see how it turns out =)

I personally know sellers that were screwed by paypal. A simple google search would show you how many complaints there are.
Plus, you can't do 25 cent transactions on pretty much any amount under $10k with paypal. IMO, Dwolla is currently the best fiat merchant service available.

Will it use the existing bitcoin network, or will it have to connect to special servers like Electrum?
Edit: Nevermind, your post below says there will have to be a special server.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:09:19
I see you just used the "bitcoin:" address. Did you install the bitcoin client on your server to automatically verify payments, similar to a callback? Or are you just doing everything manually?
@_date: 2013-02-14 20:39:20
How does electrum and the standard client deal with encryption? Can any hacker/virus get in and just send money to someone? I remember reading someone recommended storing your wallet in truecrypt. I see no reason to do that, though, if there is already built-in encryption in the client.

Wow, thank you so much for explaining that! I understand now! Since I've never worked with bitcoind, I didn't even know there was such a thing as accounts. Apparently, it's wallets -&gt; accounts -&gt; addresses, as I've just read [here](
Even though for my particular application it's overkill to run bitcoind and do everything myself, I realize that I'd rather do it this way just to learn how bitcoin works, and so I can use the knowledge to code in the future.
If you don't mind, can you answer a couple more questions:
1. Is bitcoind resource-intensive? I have a single VPS, so I don't want it taking up a lot of RAM, CPU, and bandwidth. What can I expect in terms of usage?
2. What is the best way to communicate with bitcoind using PHP? I saw [this]( kit--is it currently the best way to go, or is there an easier, more straight forward way? EDIT: just looked at the kit, it doesn't seem to have any account-based features in the API. How else can I do this?
3. Lastly, how do you keep up with the development of bitcoin? When updates are made, new commands/features added or removed/deprecated, etc?
Thanks, theymos!
Edit: Just found the [php wiki]( which seems pretty cool. Now, why would anyone need another php development kit, like the one I linked above, when this one seems to be able to do it all?
@_date: 2013-08-08 13:16:27
Another downside I can see is if a law is passed in a particular country outlawing bitcoins, would the issuer be able to specifically ban the usage of their certificates for bitcoin usage?

Question for you: "We are currently setting it as a subsidiary of our Bank"
Does this mean, technically, that your bank will be similar to an account of the parent bank? If so, can't it still run into the same issues of that account being closed? If that it the case, then everyone's accounts can still be closed.
Thanks. Anyhow, great news!
@_date: 2013-07-14 01:28:16
Is there a way, in most bitcoin clients, to associate addresses with groups, sub-groups, sub-sub-groups, etc? Like having 5 invoices for 1 customer, and many customers, etc? I would think sending tons of invoices to people with different addresses would eventually get really disorganized.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:18:38
Ok, first off, the major thing stopping bitcoin from getting bigger is the governments and all of the hassles and hurdles they create. If the banks wouldn't close merchants' account, if companies didn't have to worry about lawsuits for every single decision they make, we wouldn't be having these problems today. So yes, the free market is the way to go. Only problem is, we don't HAVE a truly free market currently, so the leaders up top have the capability to ruin anything. Bitcoin isn't perfect, but it's 1000x better than the current system.
And I don't buy the dumb deflationary argument. People don't spend money because they think their money will be worth less next year, that's absurd. People spend money because they want things, and it'll always be that way. That's just what they brainwash people in the colleges to think so that the governments can continue milking the system.

Lots of room for antics anywhere in the world. The good thing about this method is since there is no way to profit from it, there is little incentive to do it. The main thing here is that sellers will be a lot more trustworthy this way, and the actual (dumb) scamming sellers will be quickly picked out with a growing number of unsatisfied customers.

Well, what you're trying to say is that it is no longer possible to prosper by charging customers who don't actually need your service. You'll have to change your business model then and offer something of value.
Or, a service can be built into an online wallet that allows merchants to withdraw bitcoins from your account. Thank goodness this isn't allowed in the bitcoin protocol.

How about a globalized site for sending money anywhere in the world using fiat? It'd be like logging in to Western Union or something, and they would deposit the amount of fiat they want to send from their bank account, choose a destination, and click "send".
Behind the scenes, what it actually does is convert to bitcoin, send to the destination (bitcoin address, another user_id in the same company, an email, etc), and the recipient, depending on the method sent to him, would simply click "convert to USD" (or he could set his account to automatically do it for him upon receipt.)
Using this method, it could work quite fast and be technologically simple to understand.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:43:28

Out of curiosity, what ARE the server requirements?
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:03:14
The deterministic wallet automatically generates addresses based on the pass phrase given. You can export a key and import it to the electrum wallet, but the next time you generate that wallet from your secret phrase, that address won't be there (since it wasn't part of the algorithm.) Therefore, you'd have to send the bitcoins from your bitcoin-qt wallet to an address in Electrum in order to utilize this feature.
For the average user, though, it's not necessary to use bitcoin-qt, since it downloads the entire blockchain, which is overkill. Electrum doesn't require the whole blockchain, since it connects to other servers instead. Multibit also doesn't require the whole blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:30:52
Yes, people seem to be missing these points.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:26:18
Would you use an API like blockchain, or install the bitcoin client on the server and do your own wallets?
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:19:39
Is bitcoin actually accepted by governments as a legit currency? If not, how could it be taxed? It'd be more like bartering.
Legit question, btw.
@_date: 2013-08-21 01:06:04
From what I understand, bitcoind doesn't have the functionality to "watch" keys that are not in its own wallet. The only solution is to actually generate key pairs, encrypt the wallet, and put them on the server. That way, you have a "watching" wallet. I assign an address from the key pool to each customer, which doesn't need to be encrypted to do so. Then I watch for incoming payments.
Great, I got a payment! Now what? The address was assigned to the customer in the server's wallet, not on my personal computer. On my computer, that address is still in the key pool. So what do I do? Well, I could download a backup of the wallet from the server (that doesn't require you to decrypt it first, right?), run a -rescan, and send out the payments. Now the payments are made, what's next? The wallet on the server still has the wrong info in it, so I have to run a rescan on the server, and the wallet on my PC now has new keys in the keypool, so the two wallets (yet still the same wallet) have pretty much diverged, and it gets impossible to handle.
Do you have any better suggestions? If I could figure out how to watch addresses using bitcoind without actually having them in my wallet, that would probably be the solution I'm looking for.
Thanks =) And yeah, I switched away from Windows (the second time in my life) after all the NSA crap came up, and even saw an article showing a built-in backdoor in Windows since '95 for the government. I couldn't be happier with Linux Mint =)

From what I understand, bitcoins ARE tracable by IP. The point it, I doubt the government will make a full-blown investigation to find your bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2013-02-20 00:37:25
So if the site was hacked, say, for one whole day, and 10,000 people updated to the new client, then those 10,000 could have all the bitcoins in their wallet sent to a hacker's account that also uses the same hacked client.
Also, if over 50% of the clients get affected, then that pretty much takes care of the whole network, right?

May I ask if you'll be making it clear that dollars (cash) and other currencies pose a much bigger problem for illegal drugs than bitcoin does?
A great parallel to bring up is the internet. No policitican in their right mind will think about banning the internet. After all, they ARE aware that the invention of the internet has brought about a HUGE amount of child pornography, drug trafficing, terrorism, and other things which were not possible before. And yet, everyone sees how much more good internet does than bad.
I think that would be a fantastic comparison to describe bitcoin to the general populace.
Thanks, and good luck!

Seriously. After getting into bitcoin, every time I have to enter a bank, wait in line, talk to the (very nice) tellers, sign papers, etc, it feels SO archaic. It's a system that's centuries old, and there's simply no need for it anymore. I'm just wondering how long it'll take to be completely replaced.

I decided to try the same thing with the electrum wallet and it was completely straight forward there. I made the new "seed", imported the private key, and the balance showed up right after I restarted electrum. I then sent the bitcoins from my imported key to one of the electrum seed keys.
As for what I did before, unlapped_dog told me to export the multibit wallet, which I did. This exported key file contained the one (empty) bitcoin private key, along with the date of the export. I simply replaced the private key shown there with the one that bitcoin-qt gave me, and saved the file. I then went back to multibit and imported this file, and the balance did not update. So I tried messing around with that date file, trying various dates and importing the key file again and again, but the balance was still not showing up right.
Anyhow, I decided to try electrum instead and it worked out pretty easily =)

The problem here is that you have a monopoly (in this case, the government) that gets to make decisions on what you do or don't need. If you don't like what they do, well, tough luck, they get to decide what services they provide, and how much it'll cost. It goes against the idea of the free market that bitcoin helps so much with.
It's for this reason that the best services will ALWAYS be provided by the free market. If a service isn't good enough for the public, someone else will always be there to make it better and take business away from the inefficient one.

Placing these machines around is also another way to promote bitcoin in the first place--it would also get nearby stores to start accepting it. Anyone that has the extra money to spend to help promote it would be doing good. For any moderately successful business, $5k isn't a big dent in your bank account.
@_date: 2013-07-06 03:19:58
You're taking this a bit too far, IMO. If you're going to go through your whole life not trusting a single soul, you're going to have a miserable time. There's no need to be so paranoid. They're not asking you to store your life savings on these things, but to use them for small amounts to make payments. They even advise you keep only amounts in which you can spend all of them at once.
If you don't like the service and don't trust it, you don't have to use it. That's the beauty of bitcoin: you can take any path you'd like. You can go with your own wallet, or use a digital wallet. But I highly doubt everyone out there, including blockchain.info, input.io, and bit-card are out to get your money.

How can they stay afloat with such low fees?
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:25:21
I think you may be missing one important fact: than in doing it this way and increasing the amount of merchants/vendors accepting bitcoin, there becomes less and less of a need to even hold fiat in the first place. I can make the same argument you're making about BitPay: what's the utility in accepting bitcoin just to pay fees elsewhere to exchange back to fiat? 
The answer to this is that there are measures like this and like BitPay which are only necessary in bitcoin's infancy stage. As the economy gets much bigger, these tools can be thrown out.

Final question: how easy is it for someone not too knowledgeable in linux? =) Do they have tutorials for it?
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:39:30
Oh, I see, so its purpose is the same as a paper wallet? Why wouldn't people just print their own and hide it somewhere?
And, wouldn't it be more beneficial to create a bitcoin debit card the way I described in my OP? A company, say "MasterCoin" (I like that =) could create its own proprietary software for PC/Android, and issue debit cards similar to these. Whichever merchants have this software can just scan these MasterCoin cards and charge the customer, much like a debit card. This software would automatically make the change go back to the same wallet address, and the software would also be able to check the current balance.
Why hasn't this been made? Is there a flaw with this idea? It seems that this way would really make it much simpler for consumers to bring bitcoin out into the real world, and make it just as easy for merchants to accept payments.

The email that was sent out:

Unfortunately, it was recently discovered that the Bitcoin Forum's server
was compromised. It is currently believed that the attacker(s) *could* have
accessed the database, but at this time it is unknown whether they actually did
so. If they accessed the database, they would have had access to all
personal messages, emails, and password hashes. To be safe, it is
recommended that all Bitcoin Forum users consider any password used
on the Bitcoin Forum in 2013 to be insecure: if you used this
password on a different site, change it. When the Bitcoin Forum
returns, change your password.
Passwords on the Bitcoin Forum are hashed with 7500 rounds of
sha256crypt. This is very strong. It may take years for
reasonably-strong passwords to be cracked. Even so, it is best to
assume that the attacker will be able to crack your passwords.
The Bitcoin Forum will return within the next several days after a
full investigation has been conducted and we are sure that this

Every startup currency in history has had a hard time getting started, due to risks and volatility. This isn't any different.

The point of bitcoin is it's decentralized. There is no reason to have only one world currency, though. You can multiple decentralized currencies all competing with each other, with more than one in popular use in any given place. That way if one goes down for whatever reason, people still have another in use.
So the stress with bitcoin is its nature, not that it's "the only son of money."

Me too. Additionally, I don't see this being a lot of extra work to do. A majority of the code for this is already in place on the buy page... they'd just need to port it to the Send page. Basically it'd be like filling in the "amount" field for you.

Of course, you could only be identified as using the SilkRoad if someone found out that the receiving address WAS silkroad (i.e. is silkroad got hacked or something). So there really does have to be a number of points known (and collaborated), which is not probable, but possible.

I'm immediately sending them to my own wallet on my computer. The idea behind it is that the server itself would be the main point of attack, via exploits through the website or something similar. The attacker would have a harder time finding and targetting my computer, though, since the transactions on the server aren't tied to any particular IP address.
The main reason I'm doing this project is to learn more about bitcoin hands on, and as you can see I'm learning a lot. How would you recommend I do this?

Thanks for the write-up. One question though: isn't installing a bitcoin client in an encrypted file, such as a truecrypt file, and just using that to save your wallet good enough? You can even take that truecrypt file and put it on multiple CDs and flash drives for backups--and only you could open them should someone find it, since the file is encrypted with only the password you know.
For extra security, you could do all of this on an Ubuntu live CD to make sure there are no keyloggers. Send BTC from coinbase or whatever to the wallet, sync, save, and unplug.

This would imply the government also believes that they will be worth much more in the future, which I doubt they do.
They also understand that if bitcoin ever does get that big, then that would put their dollar at risk, and that is by far more important to them then any money they can make with bitcoin. They will not allow it.
And lastly, even 22 billion is not *that* big for them. They throw a trillion dollars a year in the defense industry alone *per year*.

I hope this is a good sign for bitcoin. But now, just for fun, let's put on the tin foil hat for a moment:
What better way to destroy a new, volatile currency, than by getting a huge corporation to endorse it, give everyone high hopes about it and getting many people to buy it, and then in a month go "oops, didn't work out, we're dropping bitcoin support." That would be catastrophic. It certainly won't kill it, but the negative attention would be enough to slow down its growth tremendously.

No, I'd say it was created because ideally, no single authority should control the money supply. If a state of government adopts bitcoin, all the power to that country. They'd be doing the people a favor with a sound money.


That's a bit far fetched, I'd say. It's much easier to just ban it in China. They have a giant internet firewall, after all. If they can do that, they can ban anything it wants. Legal merchant would no longer be able to accept bitcoins, and their use in China would be underground only--never mainstream.

2. They print as much as they want of it, causing inflation.
3. They can't stop bitcoin, but they can ban exchanges using it, and make merchants stop accepting them.
@_date: 2013-03-10 19:50:52
So unless the bitcoins are converted to a legal currency, they are not taxable?

Yes, just installing it like normal should update it. See the other comment on this page in case that command doesn't work.
@_date: 2013-08-20 23:51:43
Take a look at my comment to KIND_DOUCHEBAG: 
I want to make a service that requires sending bitcoins to various destinations after I've received them. That means I need the private keys somewhere along the way, so cold-storage is out of the question. The problem I'm facing is not specific to my service I want to make, but to all bitcoin-related services: how to automate spending coins, without sacrificing security. I don't need to spend bitcoin IMMEDIATELY, and can do so a couple times a day if I need to, preferably using some kind of script on my computer (I'd rather not risk doing it on the server).
Taking a quick look at libbitcoin, it looks like this is for C++ only? I'm only knowledgeable in PHP, so that might be out of the question =(
Anyhow, I'm not building anything huge like a wallet or something, just a side project. I just want to learn how to do it right =)
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:26:19
Sorry, I don't have code to share with you as it's easier to implement 3rd party APIs =) Not using a 3rd party service would make it a bit more complicated, but not too difficult, either. It'd look like this:
1. Import a bunch of public keys into your database.
2. Someone makes a purchase, you serve them one of those keys and tie it to their invoice so that you'll know the payment is theirs. Don't use that key anymore.
3. Using the [watch-only functionality]( of bitcoind (which is NOT yet in the official release!), you would run a cron every minute to check the balance of the addresses that are awaiting payment. This would be done with the JSON-RPC.
4. Once the cron detects a payment, update the database, send the user their product.
5. Profit
If you do make this, it'd be great if you shared the code =)
Good luck.
@_date: 2013-08-26 01:59:03
Banks implies a fractional reserve system, and is not inherently safe. You could simply have secure bitcoin storage service, or something of the sort, where you pay a small yearly fee.
@_date: 2013-09-05 19:18:07
If they were to ever implement it, this is probably how they'd do it. They probably wouldn't allow merchants to post their bitcoin addresses on their listings according to their TOS.
@_date: 2013-08-25 04:21:01


This isn't accurate. Pretty much every government-issued currency is also only backed by trust.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:43:43
I'd say this is the major one right here. As it becomes more and more popular, more and more propaganda will come out against it via MSM. Once they get everyone to start beliving that bitcoin is evil, and is for illegal purposes, etc etc, it'll become as scary as smoking 3 marijuanas per day.
Although many people will still know the real value of such a currency, I'm afraid some big sites will now want their image tainted by offering "underground" currencies as payment options. Reddit, wordpress, and other businesses that actively start using them may want to remove the option.
That, and if the government outright bans bitcoin. They can't stop it 100%, but they'll really stop/brainwash a lot of people in the process.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:03:09
It's not secure in someone else's hands. That would make it just like keeping your money in the bank.

Ah, you're absolutely right. My mistake.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:02:42
There's no way to currently use all of those bitcoins in the current economy, though. To be fully used (and not just invested in BTC), it would need to be converted to another currency, which would incur a large fee. Still pretty cool though.
@_date: 2013-08-13 18:41:16
As acceptance is now, they won't. But if they buy it as an investment, assuming bitcoin explodes further and becomes more widely accepted, I'm sure it'll pay off.
@_date: 2013-04-07 00:25:27
You don't understand. When the government does it, it's not stealing, it's for your protection. They really only have your best interest in mind. I don't know why anyone would ever distrust their government.
@_date: 2013-08-08 12:41:29
Yeah, I'm on the latest. Only options when I right-click an address are: copy to clipboard, qr code, edit label, private key, sign message.
By the way, is there a way to check the balances of each individual address with electrum, instead of a sum total?
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:43:24


Well, isn't a bitcoin client supposed to do the job of the bank? If I downloaded all of the security software that banks use, I would running the same security they are. So IMO there needs to be a "bank equivalent" security bitcoin client that simply needs to be downloaded to take effect, and that will have the same ease of use as that which everyone is already used to.
I don't know much about how this works, but instead of having people using an Ubuntu live CD to access a computer "without internet" and no keyloggers, would it be possible to develop software that runs like a virtual OS on top of windows? This virtual OS would only have the bitcoin client as an admin, and no other software could run in it. Maybe that could be something really secure, and easy to use?
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:16:40
Upvote for you, sir.
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:50:22
Plus, the idea of banks is simply archaic. It's been around for centuries because there was no better way to do it. To have to go to a building, talk to someone, pay fees, get asked annoying questions, all just to send some money somewhere. It feels like you're still in the 19th century or something. It truly is archaic, and bitcoin has arrived to help change the system.
@_date: 2013-05-18 05:36:03
How can you send any bitcoins at all if the internet is down? Or was it up, but only disconnected from all international countries only?
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:15:30
The worth of those bitcoins is play money for the government. That's not even a slight reason for them to protect bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:38:48
Sorry, I missed "million" from my post. I edited it now. Did coinbase and the others really pay that much money? If so, that just sounds like government blackmail. "Pay us $25 million and you can run an exchange."
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:09:54
Maybe I'm misunderstanding your wording or something, but that's not how it works at all. jcoinner's explanation above is how it works.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:06:56
You will need to supply a form where the buyer can include their shipping address before they pay. This shouldn't be too hard to do. If you need someone in PHP to help you with this, I'd love to do it for you. Send me a PM if interested.
You could make it save the address to the database (if you have one), or make it simply send you an email with it once the payment is made.
@_date: 2013-08-20 19:42:29
Cool. Why not in the US?

How does one figure out his firstbits if he wants to receive a payment?
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:05:57
Nothing has objective value, except for what value we believe it has. It applies to everything. Gold and precious metals will always have value because people will always think they have value, and it has been thought of that way for thousands of years--it's not going to change.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:00:43


So the answer is, sure, why not? It's a commodity, and it's money, too. The guy was downplaying it since he gets few payments with it, but I'm sure he wouldn't be downplaying this "commodity" if 99 out of 100 orders were made with it.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:28:13
I know this post is old, but I figured I'd let you know that Gyft sells gift cards for bitcoins for many stores you may shop at, including Amazon, and they give 3% back in credits, as well.

@_date: 2013-07-25 22:49:11


Why would he give some of his own money out if the bank says they're about to return them, though?
@_date: 2013-06-20 21:28:17
I exported my multibit wallet and replaced the private key in the file with the one the qt client gave me. When I imported it, it didn't show me the correct balance unfortunately =( I tried using yesterday date, a date from a year ago, and the same date the file originally had, and neither worked.
@_date: 2013-05-27 17:00:33
So if I have one wallet that I use a lot to send and receive money, will it cost more and more over time to use that same wallet? When I send a payment to someone, I get the "change" from that transaction to another public key, in the same wallet. That means that if I want to keep spending money from that wallet, it'll actually be spending from multiple change keys at once, thereby charging more and more transaction fees?
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:48:24
Indeed it is.
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:22:57


That could be considered a form of idol worship.

@_date: 2013-06-18 17:46:26
Yeah that's what I'm worried about.
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:17:08


Two things: first, the majority of such a government-less population will be armed and trained in self defense. Second, the majority of any population is not evil by nature. Most individuals are not out to get you. 
Combine those two points together, and that's why there can not be a "gang" which takes over a whole region--there simply wouldn't be enough of them.
Anyhow, your point is still not based on historical fact. Historically, 99.9% of all murders are done by governments, whether they be led by kings, prime ministers, pharoahs, presidents, or what-have-you. End of story. That's what we want to prevent: centralized power.
EDIT: How many people died in the last century alone from war? More than 80 million or so? I wouldn't even start thinking about local "civil wars" with numbers like that. They are too insignificant.

What is LVT?
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:34:39
Sorry, I disagree. As a medium of exchange, it beats current options by far. Again, if we take out the fiat aspect completely (since we are talking about bitcoin itself), nothing is as easy. There are practically no fees (only small miner fees), it's just as easy as using a credit card (online or in person), and proof of purchase is built in. The only part you don't like is the fiat aspect, which is not a problem inherent with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:43:09
Cool, didn't know about bitcoin-otc. That seems like pretty much what this site is doing already.

I have no doubt crypto-currencies will lead the way. This is very much long-term postulating, though. Its growth will be hampered severely if it's banned, and will take much, much longer to get anywhere big.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:30:10
Oh for sure. It's a real shame. Things will get real interesting soon, and not just for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-26 02:04:11
Except you're forgetting that this is a worldwide currency. If one country ends up banning bitcoin exchanges, it won't cause a worldwide drop, since people in all other countries will be willing to buy up cheap coins.
Since most countries won't have them illegal, the black markets will be able to thrive even more easily.
@_date: 2013-08-28 20:43:56
Cheaper bitcoins doesn't mean it'll still have the same value.
@_date: 2013-05-02 12:52:05
So coinbase, bitpay, and other us companies paid $25 million just to be a money transmitter? Something doesn't sound right here.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:58:01
No, but every government entity only cares for its own survival.
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:05:57
Yeah, but after they repeated the question, that should have still been the answer. Indeed, why would you spend your bitcoin if they'll be worth more? Because you're not actually spending them, you're indirectly buying with dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:56:20
I love how this barrier to entry for so many payment-related things is actually the very reason bitcoin was created in the first place. The regulations and government strangulation of the payment industry actually gave birth to an inevitable evolution of payments.
@_date: 2013-08-09 01:49:53
I generate the keys on my computer and only upload the public keys to the server. I use the API to check if a payment has been made. If the API is down, the worst thing that happens is that the payment confirmation gets postponed for a little while.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:50:27
I believe it will auto-suggest fees based on what others in the network are paying. I think you'll have the option to set your own fee (not 100% sure about the last part).
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:31:55
May I ask how you integrated this? Did you use a service or API? Who did it for you? And if you yourself, where did you learn to do it?

Yup, that's what I was saying.

Can you give me an example of what you mean? What would it do better, and how? What would it solve?
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:01:37
Generally good, but like others said, I wouldn't recommend brain wallets. I would suggest installing Electrum, sending some coins there, and simply writing down the seed phrase it gives you. It's more secure, you get as many addresses as you want, and all you need is that seed to restore all of your coins. You can then delete your wallet without fear.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:06:04
Because no one can lend out your money in bitcoin. Banks lend it out, then when you ask for it and they don't have it, FDIC is here to the rescue!
Therefore, "good".
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:29:30
Except that it's not 1% anymore. They a have flat monthly membership now that doesn't charge transaction fees, and coinbase is free for the first million in sales.

Nor with centralized DNS. Just because it works in one example doesn't mean it works with another. You're just giving someone else the ability to take down legitimate content, as well.
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:39:22


Nope, if it's asking you for the password that means it's encrypted. Make sure your password is strong so it can't be brute forced.


If you ever lose your wallet file, this seed will regenerate it for you. It works because it doesn't generate bitcoin addresses randomly, but deterministically according to the seed. So you should definitely remember your password as well as the seed.


Sure, it's encrypted. Check out SpiderOak, though, they have a zero-knowledge policy, as everything is encrypted on your computer first before being sent to their servers. Not that it matters much in this case.
@_date: 2013-08-08 13:08:14

Generally, each wallet will have its own addresses, although you CAN export addresses and import them in another wallet. Or you can just send the coins to another wallet. Whatever floats your boat. You can have as many wallets as you want, and as many addresses in each wallet as you want.

Quite simply, because being free gives the most opportunity to being wealthy. Poor people aren't poor for no reason. There are many factors involved, but one of the primary factors is the amount of freedom they have to accumulate wealth (cost of living, regulations, taxes, etc).

bitcoinpitcher2, just send all the money to a good client like Electrum. A single seed phrase is all you need to back up all your coins forever--even if you lose your wallet file.
Once all your coins are in that program, send as much money as you want wherever. Your money is secure.

You're missing the important fact that general adoption to bitcoin is what will cause the demand for the easy and secure methods. Without demand, there will be no supply.

If you are ever worried about making a purchase, then only do it through a bitcoin escrow service. Paypal is a company that controls funds that go through it, and there's nothing stopping a bitcoin company from doing the same thing.
Bitcoin doesn't have stuff like that *built in*, but it's very possible to do.

Do you think their overall reaction is good toward bitcoin? How do they feel about a "competing" currency?
You may also want to tell them to buy bitcoin before this gets big, as most likely as it becomes more widely used there, the price will increase. Surely they'll want to profit from it.

No charge-backs doesn't sound good to the consumer. I think you need to make sure to mention that the power of the currency is in the individual. This means only YOU are responsible for your money. This means that yes, once you send money it's gone, but it also means no one can take your money by force due to false or unfair allegations (let's not mention the government here =).
