This is a very important stepping stone into the implementation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ETFs, which will most certainly increase the trade volume and market cap, as more people from more avenues will then have a familiar way of investing/trading in this new market.

If big institutions and banks won't embrace Bitcoin it will never reach mass adoption.
I think that the alliance between big banks and the government is about to be broken in a global decentralized economy, the rejection of the Bitcoin ETF shows that it begins to happen as Wall Street pushes towards one direction and governments to the other

I'm gonna play the devil's advocate and say that Bitcoin was always volalite even before the average Joe knew of it, Joe doesn't want to buy Bitcoin because he thinks "it's a scam", because he doesn't know the underlying reliable and scaleable basis behind Bitcoin.
We need to teach the public, even by a few bullet points, about the fact that Bitcoin is as reliable as gold in terms of it's scarcity, and the scarcity's effect on supply and demand, it's useabilty, being a stable  platform for value storage and transfer.
