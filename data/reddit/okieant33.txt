Can someone tell me what's so bad about the alt coins? I probably should put my Google Fu to work but I'd love some insight
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:32:25

First rule of Bitcoin is don't tell anyone how much Bitcoin you have.

HODL MOTHERFUCKER
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:47:06
Well yea, but I have a nice starting point.  I could build a node with a mini ATX case and leave it running while at work
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:17
You like to live dangerously I can see.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:16:00
Can someone explain this to me a bit better? Dude was talking fast as fuck and I'm a NYer so that's saying something.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:56:12
I have an extra i5 CPU laying around cuz I just upgraded to an i7.  I'm seriously thinking about building my own node and mining for myself.  The only thing is I live in NYC where electricity is expensive.  But I think with where the price of the coin is right now, it still might be worth it if I could mine half a coin a month.

I wish I had 1 BTC to Hodl
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:52:55
What happened to HODL?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:54:45
wo0o0 back up over 10.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:19:18
Good question and to be honest, I forget.  I did go through the same thing and I forget if Coinbase charged a fee.  Hopefully someone else can answer.  I've known about Bitcoin for years but I'm still relatively new to actually owning it.

And what do you think those dollars in your bank account or pocket are? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:05:03
Stop looking at Bitcoin like its a stock
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:03:19

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:31
