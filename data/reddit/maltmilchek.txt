Looking to buy, unsure about prices. Look at it this way, BTC is now at the same price it was at the start of December, yet the Alts look more like the prices they were at mid-late December. There is a discrepancy here. I don't want to buy "low" now if they continue to drop to actual December 1st levels (like BTC has)
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:49:56
When will the alts drop? I still see a lot of them at prices that are more toward the end of December range, yet BTC is at pre Dec 1 price?
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:00:48
Easier to say if you bought BTC at $100, or even $1,000.
Don't forget the people who bought it at $19,000.
"HODL" is easier if you're already 10x or more above your initial investment.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:36:56
Agreed. Still, I know some folks out there have diversified investments in things other than crypto so figured I'd share.
Gold ain't all bad in my mind. In some ways, people who used to buy gold and stash their wealth in bullion are the original counter culture to fiat!

I gotta say, seeing a lot of posts and discussion about these now, and it always reminds me of that old quote, "During the gold rush its a good time to be in the pick and shovel business."

Thanks for the suggestions, followed a few of them!

Yeah, I've thought about this. I considered buying in at $300-$400 ish back in the day and didn't.
I don't get down about it for two reasons:
1. I would've only bought one, I'm a fairly risk averse guy and didn't know enough about it at the time and was just happy to mine for fun
2. I would've sold it as soon as it hit $1k (at the time I thought that was the ceiling).
So yeah, don't forget that a lot of folk who bought at $100 or at $10 or at $1 probably also sold at $1k.

Of course, it’s not for everyone, but I think it highlights how good we do have it. I read yesterday some kid made $11mil USD last year reviewing toys on Youtube. I think he is 6. Nothing like that existed 20 or 30 years ago.
I don’t doubt that there are some things more difficult for humanity today, but overall whenever you read about the ‘state’ we’re in, everything is generally trending for the better (health, tech, food, poverty, life expectancy etc).
Not to mention, a lot of focus nowadays is on the individual at workplaces. Some of the best employers in the world offer incredible perks to attract talent, going far beyond simple remuneration (think google and other silicon valley type companies that started this trend), we are also generally more tolerant and accommodating, although some might argue political correctness is going mad, we are becoming a more accepting society (just recently here in Aus we passed same-sex marriage laws, for example).
Again, i’m not saying everything is beautiful, but the original sentiment here of the “pain” that this generation feels could be deemed as a little dramatic given the bigger picture.

It should also tell you that even though I was aware of it and involved in a minor way (mining, mining alts, trading on cryptsy... RIP) I could never have imagined it would get to where we are today. I always thought that about 100usd was going to be “the rate.”
It should tell you that even as someone who was aware of Bitcoin, I underestimated it and made a mistake. I’m not down about it, I’ve made my money elsewhere, but I am not going to be arrogant and make the same mistake in assuming I know where the market is going.
Now, I believe there is far more attention and far more potential because of the increase in users/owners.
You asked the question about where people were earlier, so i figured id give you an answer, I’m sure many are in the same boat. That is to say, it is not just all ‘new’ people who are only jumping in now, there are plenty like myself who were on the sidelines and are getting in now because of the hype.
I’m not going to pretend that I know where it is going, it may crash, but long term I now believe crypto is here to stay. It’s proven to me that regular folk are willing and able to jump in, and that there is tech out there that will solve some of the current problems, as frustrating as they are.

Great post, and what a reminder that nothing is guaranteed and life can change very quickly. This line:


Shows me what kind of person this guy is. 
For those who haven't already, check out a book called "Success and Luck: Good Fortune and the Myth of Meritocracy" by Robert Frank, a fantastic read on the topic, and for those interested in economics and fixing some of the issues we face now in society there are some fantastic points (although the libertarians here may object).

Like clockwork, forbes or cnbc or bloomberg publish a positive story and it tanks, their indicators are also pretty regularly the opposite of the way price is moving (there was a post about this recently, on my phone at moment though)
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:54:17
Been very interesting to watch the price since it topped the 10k USD mark. Yesterday it dipped back and I thought it would stay sub 10k, and now it rallies again. Also very hard to predict since there has never been anything like this before, wild stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:08:13
Yeah, I mean, it's an exciting time if the price rises or even maintains the current value. There could be many other ancillary Bitcoin-related services and jobs that spring up thanks to the boom, which you can then also invest in.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:04:58
Pretty informative, interesting to see some of those graphs from a few years back.
Personally, I now tend to feel that we're in a whole different era thanks to the increase in media coverage. It is far more mainstream newsworthy than it has ever been, and that is fueling even more demand and more bullish behavior. 
I tend to think now that once the people with serious money realize what it's all about is when it will really take off. And by that I mean the people who traditionally hide money in gold etc. Once the elites realize that they can effectively stash their wealth in a bitcoin wallet, trade with other fat cat elites, all without government eyes knowing how much they have (provided they don't cash out of course), it will boom again.
A lot of these types of users simply have no idea at the moment of what it can do for them, and they also have financial advisors and people managing their wealth who are still a little oldschool. Mainstream adoption and media/news will change their minds, you can bet the Winklevoss have already educated many of their elite chums.
PS. I don't see this as a bad thing, whatever floats your boat, and for those hodling this will be very good, as it is one of the best shots at the price hitting the 'moon' that people are waiting for.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:52:31

So much mainstream attention of the price rise, I can't see that making it slow down anytime soon. Crazy.

Good work. I just commented on a similar issue regarding exchanges and the volatility/risk here. I lost a very small amount on Cryptsy a while back, glad it was only minor, but still, the possibility of losing what I have in an exchange now is still scary, no matter how reputable they say they are.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:55:33
Yeah, I'm pretty sure across many metrics we are living in the most prosperous and safe time in human history. There are less wars, less plague/disease, better technology, better health, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty is the lowest it has ever been, etc.
What's more, you can now bootstrap and set yourself on a path of financial success across many more avenues. YouTube, SoundCloud, and social media stars are example of this. Do you think youth 50 or 100 years ago were being paid to sit around playing games and cracking jokes? Well now you can do that, you can make a living streaming, crazy stuff.
Likewise, the gateways to mainstream success used to be controlled by the big players, publishers, record labels etc. Now you can bypass that, you can be an indie artist and promote yourself globally, at minimal cost.
I could go on...
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:24:31
Where was I?
10usd. Talking about it with some other devs and friends. Didn't think about buying, couldn't be bothered jumping through hoops of verification, scammy looking exchanges etc. I am generally very risk averse.
100usd &amp; 200usd. Mining it for fun in spare time off a gpu. Not really thinking much of it, there wasn't anything I was going to buy with it, so I didn't look into it much further.
1000usd. Thinking that this was the ceiling, definitily couldn't buy in at this point, but to be honest I wasn't too concerned, had other things going on in life.
Now. Getting in with a small amount that won't bother me if I lose it, and spreading that across multiple cryptos, and then forgetting about it to see how things shake out in a few years. One way or another, Crypto is going to continue and Bitcoin isn't going away anytime soon.
There is something to all of this. Even if Bitcoin right now is just not performing the function it intended to do, it still may, and there is still room for growth. The only thing that scares me is the people who jumped in for short term gains who might panic and get the wrong impression of crypto in general because of their negative experience (fees, transaction times) and the FUD about tether being used to prop up Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:53:01
I think what worries me most is that there are a lot of people getting involved purely to hold - myself included. If everyone is like me, then maybe there might be a problem in the future because no one is actually 'using' the currency.
It's great that there is mainstream media coverage and more people are exposed, but the end result of that exposure is just, "woah, what is this? how do I get in on it? and how long do i have to wait before I'm rich."
Ultimately it's supposed to be a currency, and it can't be a currency if we're all just sitting on it and not buying anything with it or using it other than to trade for fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:47:58
Interesting graph, I like how it's still going up at 2020 too, so he reckons it will surpass $1mil.
Honestly, I don't know anymore. I don't think that is where it will get to, I think $100k range, but I've been wrong before so I don't trust my gut on these things anymore. (FYI, I was wrong at predicting that $1k was the MAX it would get to)
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:23:39
I remember reading a story a couple years back of a guy who sold all his BTC locally when it was 10x his initial investment. He used the money to pay off his house, so he had a decent sum. Anyway, the guy was a freelance developer, so he basically put through all the exchanges as 'sales of software' on his business, paid the GST, paid the income tax etc, and made sure it was all 100% with his accountant. That was the gist of it.
This was a while back though, now they probably recognize it as an actual investment and cap gains tax issues etc. Back then he probably had a shitload from the &lt; $1 days and sold it when it was a few hundred bucks.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:22:14
Those "other three" aren't bubbles: they are apps that give utility to those users. The users who are rushing to download coinbase aren't doing it so they can start using BTC, they are doing it so they can buy in on the hype and make a quick buck. 
I think that is a problem. Beating YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram is great, but the users who were onboarding to those apps were doing it to USE the apps, daily. The reason people are rushing to coinbase and rushing to exchanges in general is to just get rich quick. There is no denying that. Most aren't going to be using BTC to make purchases online, they are going to be buying a very small amount ($5-$100 USD worth) and seeing if they can cash in on the mania.
A large portion of them will buy in and then sell as soon as it drops even slightly.
@_date: 2018-09-23 09:01:32

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:18:53

Here comes another smear...
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:20:17
It's great advice, and applies really to anything one can invest in. The truth is, as historic and huge this whole situation is, there is still a lot of shady stuff going on.
I was mining LTC a few years back and converting to BTC (as was the trend), at the time there were pools like LTC Rabbit, which I used to be on, and that just disappeared. There were exchanges, like Cryptsy, and look what happened there - a class action lawsuit is underway I believe to retrieve users funds - I lost a small amount, but couldn't imagine how upset I would've been if there was a lot in there.
I think this is probably one of the bigger problems now, the exchanges and the possibility of being exploited/hacked/swindled. It is true that this is also the case for other forms of investment, but other stockmarkets have been around a long time and there is some more safety in brick and mortar operations.
I'll be happy when in a few years we have some more stable and reputable exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:16:40
You could setup something to do this fairly easily, it would search/scrape articles based on certain keywords/search terms and then would store the date published. From there you could sort out the reporting.

@_date: 2017-12-26 13:03:26
This is it. It's much harder to tell someone to 'HODL' when they've only recently bought in, at todays much higher prices, which will still take some time to increase meaningfuly for them. Sure, the guy who bought in at $1, $10, or even $100 can quite easily 'HODL' now because there is much more buffer before their initial investment gets eaten into.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:36:47
Thanks for the writeup, I thought that shorting requires that you borrow from someone who actually HAS the assets in question? 
So, if you wanted to short a stock, you would buy/borrow it from a lender who has those stocks, then you would sell, then wait for the drop, then buy back at lower price, give the stock back to the original lender, and keep whatever profit/difference.
What am I missing here?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:02:12
This is what I've heard from friends as well. I wonder if it's the term 'Bitcoin,' that is the issue since most people think of a 'coin' as one whole unit that is not possible to subdivide?
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:12:22
They often do, at least back in the day this was the case when the first ASIC miners came out (from memory). Vendors were double dipping, they were taking money for "pre orders," building the miners, using them, then delivering them (sometimes not delivering them) once the difficulty was raised anyway.
@_date: 2018-08-10 00:13:16
Interesting. I think ease of use is still the big barrier, personally. People have no idea about bitcoin wallet addresses and easily make mistakes copying/pasting etc. 
Plus it’s quite daunting to someone who isn’t tech savvy to see those long address strings. 
Having it somehow passed thru a phone number (which is still unique) which acts as a kind of easy mask or easy address could help with that.

I think it's good for Bitcoin in the sense that a lot of shitcoins will become useless or irrelevant. 
Libra will have a massive advantage in achieving what a lot of smaller alt currency cryptos are trying to do. 
Plus the fact that FB already has the masses to be able to onboard the coin very quickly through FB, WhatsApp, Messenger etc. Then they're partnered up with some big companies (MasterCard, PayPal, etc) straight off the bat, and have some of the most talented engineers in the world working there. 
I don't see how smaller currency alts will be able to compete once Libra launches, but I guess we'll see.

Sentiment seems to be improving. BTC is out of the downtrend as well (by the looks of it), I'm interested to see if BTC breaks ATH again in the coming months, because it's dominance in total market cap has steadily been climbing - we're at 41.8% dominance now!
@_date: 2018-03-04 01:05:48
Most people on TradingView believe we're out of the down-trend now, at least from what I've been seeing. I also think this, but I guess you can never be 100% certain.
What's most interesting to me is BTC Dominance on CMC. It's the highest it's been since December 2017. It started falling around March 2017 during the ICO rush and subsequent BTC/Alts boom of December 2017.
Now it looks to regain it's dominance. I think that's a great thing, there are WAY too many shitcoins, WAY too many scams, and ICO mania is subsiding with returns nowhere near what they were last year.
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:38:13
I get the feeling someone knew about the changes at PayPal - which will steer more toward Bitcoin for OS transfers - and that is why we had that huge pump a couple of weeks back. 
Didn’t PayPal send out an email about updated policies and tighter rules about a week later?
@_date: 2018-07-14 14:23:15
Even if you're an avid altcoin fan, you have to concede that those coins aren't going to 'pump' again unless BTC does (except for the few that have fiat trading pairs on larger exchanges... and even then). 
Bitcoin is king and Bitcoin is what currently raises or lowers the tide that altcoin boats float on.

I somewhat agree that hoarding money isn't ideal right now, but on the other hand, a little bit of hoarding might not hurt considering the state of rampant hyper-consumerism in the world that leads to some problems as well, [The price of fast fashion]( for example. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for free markets and capitalism, but I also think that people have been easily exploited to just always buy shit they don't really need, and products aren't made to last anymore because this mindset has become the new normal. Where an appliance may have lasted 10 or 20 years in the past, it might only last only 5-10 years now as the pricing and sales models on these sorts of things have shifted with the mindset of consumers.
If this behaviour was 'curbed' because those same people are now more mindful of their wealth and 'hoarding' - that could be a good thing to some degree?
Also, remember that not everyone would behave this way, there are no absolutes. Many people would still spend and would still need to spend. You have to pay for food and some form of shelter, after all.
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:09:31
Of course not. I'm still curious, what purpose do you think it serves? Is there another alternative to my two potential reasons (a. extract btc from suckers or b. suppress price with negative news  - or both). Do you have any other theory? Could just be a coincidence of some very stupid people trying to scam others, or it might not be, I can't know for sure - can you?
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:13:34
Maybe I'm getting too cynical, skeptical, or just plain distrust the media, but I cannot understand how these are legit. Surely anyone with sense would realize that they would get tracked as soon as they move the BTC and try to cash it out to fiat. 
Just doesn't sit right with me, but hey, maybe there are some very stupid people out there who happened to call these in just as prices start to slide. Or maybe its BS, orchestrated to give BTC a little nudge in the right direction along with some selling to get the market to panic.
Guess we'll find out.
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:45:35
I don't honestly know what to believe about this news, but I just don't buy it's a legit threat, it's a scam in my opinion - and if that is the case, then it's either a scam to actually extort BTC (if so, it's a really stupid one) or it's there to create big headlines and get BTC in a negative light in national press - which is a plausible tactic and probably welcomed by those wanting to buy BTC a little cheaper.
What's your opinion? Do you believe these threats are real?
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:50:12
I'm curious at what point some of the original hodlers who sold last year will buy back in. I'm guessing that there are a fair few who had coins from the beginning and have sold along the way but always kept a bit. I'm also guessing that those who sold most or even all in Dec 2017 would be tempted now to return - after all, they might see this as another opportunity to get back on board.
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:51:53
Except the people who are pushing this 'movement', they'll have their coins on exchange on Jan 3rd, ready to sell.
