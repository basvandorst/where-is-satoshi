I do. It was all so much more fun. Everyone was excited and I met really interesting people trading.  Kinda dull now....

Bitcoin was so much more fun when you bought them off some guy in a bar and random people kept trying to steal them off you. Now people complain if they don't get their one bitcoin at the exact specific time they wanted it and moan about service levels just like ordinary people do.
How I dream of the good old days of 2013.

morgan spurlock comes into your business with a camera crew and you almost fuck it up because you can't risk the price of a cup of coffee? what an idiot.

I bought the beer in August last year and the food about a month ago. I also paid .3 bitcoin for a pint of maple syrup which at the the time was about $20. At the start of today was about $80. Expensive maple syrup. Tasted great though.

Hey benteague, I live in Florida but have UK bank accounts. If you want to buy small quantities let me know and I will help you out. You can just pay the cash into my Nat West account and I will forward the Bitcoins to you. No fees, whatever the rate is at the time. Message me. I don't mind sending you a small amount first to show faith. Just paying it forward.

I have bought Bitcoin magazine, beer and food with BTC. (At today's pricing it was very expensive beer and food. :))

No, thankfully. No pizza tastes that good. Mind you it is probably only worth $1,000,000 now.

Don't borrow money to invest. Especially not off family as you really have to pay them back.

Love the Oath idea. I really do want to use my Bitcoin but don't see the point if all the vendor is going to do is cash out to fiat. I am far more likely to buy off someone if I know they are going to keep the coins.

Start doing it for a few people and if you are fair word will spread quickly.

Poured my Bitcoin bought Black Pup maple syrup over my pancakes this morning. Very nice it was too. Rather disappointingly there was no awesome beard hair in it.

Thanks. Just ordered a pint. I am going to pour my Bitcoin profits all over some buckwheat pancakes. Free tastiness.....
