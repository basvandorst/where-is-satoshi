Only if you're registered as a professional gambler. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:25:53
So the mistake is that I don't wear a suit?
OK. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:06:10
And then what is the difference between you converting to fiat and me doing it?
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:25:40
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:25:23
Not really. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:22:37
Which is fine.  But then we're not taking Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:24:16
and if you don't accept it, prepare for the down vote army to accuse you of colluding with the NSA.

It's property, so taxed at cap gains rates, but potentially using the basis of the sender/buyer. 
Those are the "tax consequences" of which I spoke. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:06:51
we're not a non-profit.
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:20:22
They are not zero.  If you take BTC, you are responsible for the sender's basis. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:04:50
More the former, actually. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:07:47
Ha.  You should try selling things through them.
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:14:41
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:16:43
This. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:13:56
Not really
@_date: 2014-06-27 06:23:51
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:18:02
Sure, we could do this, and we might, but that's not really taking BTC, now is it?
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:26:39
Huh?  
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:24:09
I'm curious as to why this is the case. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:18:53
Slightly worse than this.  You have to be able to track the sender/buyer's basis. 
That's the ugly part. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:08:32
Yes, but then I'm not accepting Bitcoin, which is what the OP asked.
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:01:02
brah?   you da kine?
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:35:38
Your grammar marks you as either foreign, or uneducated.


Bitcoin does no such thing.  
Previously you've advocated for tax evasion.  
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:16:17
Wow.  Really?
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:13:39
It's not a donation.  It's an exchange of value. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:10:52


My concern here is that the situation will devolve into, "why can't I pay you in BTC directly?"
and then we're right back to the potential tax consequences of dealing with an unknowable basis.

And I luv your username.
