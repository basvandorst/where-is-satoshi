From what I learned recently, the Core never agreed to the New York Agreement. It was mostly miners and businessmen. Core never agreed because they believed that increasing blocksize will lead to centralization and it would never be a proper long term solution. Core has been working on a possible long term solution for scaling micropayments i.e. the lightening network. Let's be a little patient and watch how that turns out. Hopefully, it will put an end to all this scaling debate.

It would be nice to provide links to various exchange webpages where you can specifically make complaints like this.

You're sending from Trezor and it's asking for $60 in fees? I have a Ledger Nano S and it says 10 cents to send 1 bitcoin right now on fast confirmation. I wonder why there is such a huge difference...

Isn't segwit2x BIP91 or 141 or something that passed by more than 95% of hashing power? If so, doesn't that mean everyone has to follow segwit2x and whoever wants to deviate from it has to fork off while segwit2x claims the original chain?

I think whoever wrote the code for BCH hard fork also put in place the replay protection. Right now B2X is refusing to do the same claiming they are not a fork because they are forming from NYA and that Core should put a replay protection on their chain and fork off because they are not following NYA. If neither side budges, there will be no replay protection and when you send coin from one chain, coins from both your chains may get sent. That is my limited understanding right now but I could be wrong.

where are you sending it from? do you have a hardware, software, or a web wallet? I don't know of any wallet that charges that much right now.

My Ledger says 10 cents to send 1 bitcoin right now. Where is "almost everyone" sending money from that is asking for such high fees?

What the fuck dude! This actually worked! Thanks, you're a lifesaver! You should start a thread about this. And yeah, what a shitty fucking update experience...

Which CNBC program was he on? I want to watch it.

Yeah I agree but bcash never had an 'official' (or backdoor) agreement nor miners publicly signaling for support. I think s2x is unique in that regard.

I tried to update this morning and my Ledger is broken now. Update didn't work so I reset my device by typing in the 24 seed words which takes me forever for somer reason. Now I keep getting this message "MCU firmware is outdated" and nothing works. I can't update and I can't use the device.

This is Bitseed. Not sure if theyre reputable. It says its sold out for now so some people must be using it.
