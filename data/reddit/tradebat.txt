Holy shit man. "It's my inheritance, not her retirement money"
You also JUST learned what bonds are, so your opinion on them are about as valid as my opinions on molecular science. 
You have a LOT of learning to do kid. And I say 'kid' very literally, not as some generic internet insult. You are very obviously a child.
I feel bad for your grandmother tbh, does she know that you view her money as something you are entitled to? I really hope she donates her estate and doesn't pass on her hard work to you, because you are going to squander it on investments believing that you know what you're doing. You don't even know what bonds are, you are definitely going to lose it all.

Here is the thing about mainstream adoption..
Most people these days are actually pretty good with mobile devices. My parents use ipads, and have their own iphones (still trying to get my dad to use android, but he hardly sees the need for a smartphone so ease of use trumps function for him), and even my older aunts and uncles are calling me on facetime. People understand mobile devices.
But try explaining cloud services, P2P networks, and encryption, and we start losing some folks. 10 years ago it was much much worse. I don't know how the adoption rate of bitcoin can compare to the adoption rate of the internet, email, or facebook, but I imagine it's similar. 
And it all just requires time. It took my dad a decade to finally give in and get an iphone, but in that time, how many future iphone users were born? That's what we need to be thinking about. It's not about if we can convince our parents to start using bitcoin, but if we can make it understandable and useful for our children.
It's just time. Bitcoin isn't a bubble, an space ship, or a volcano. It's a tectonic plate. We can try and all stand on one end of it to make it shift faster, but it won't really make any difference when it's all said and done.

I only trade ETHBTC, and even then I rarely place orders. 
Altcoins should be for holding unless you are a professional and have a large margin account.
Cryptos in general should not be daytraded. If you want to daytrade crypto I would say that the keystone to your strategy should be to never short anything, at which point you are just investing for all practical purposes.
If you want to daytrade, do it with fiat currencies.

It depends on your strategy. Some people set their take profit for 3x that of their stop loss, and they only need to win 1 out of 3 to break even. 
Some people set their stop loss and take profit 1:1, and they need to win over 50% of their trades to remain profitable.

It's called 'pyramiding'.
So lets assume for a moment that we can see into the future, and we know for a fact that over the next 24 hours the price will increase by 200 points. 
So we enter in our first position, and in 6 hours, the price has increased by 50 points. From our first position we have gained 50 points.
We enter our second position 6 hours in, and in 6 hours, the price will increase by another 50 points. From our first position we have now gained 100 points, and from our second position we gain 50 points.
We enter our third position at hour 12. On hour 18, the price has increased by another 50 points. Our first position is now worth 150, our second position is now worth 100, and our third position is worth 50.
We enter our fourth and final position at hour 18. On hour 24, the price has increased by another 50 - totaling 200 points over 24 hours. Our first position is now worth 200, 2nd is worth 150, 3rd is worth 100 and our fourth and final position is worth 50. All combined, we made gained 500 points off of 200 points of movement. Sure, we could have just entered all 4 positions immediately and have them all be worth 200 points at the end of the 24 hours period, but would you do that if you couldn't see into the future, how it would be outside of this exercise?
So since we don't know the future, we pyramid into positions that we THINK will be worth 200 points over 24 hours, but we aren't sure, so we wait for our previous positions to give us some cushioning before entering in a new one, so we wait 50 points and adjust our stoploss on our 1st position before entering into the 2nd position.
That was a lot, I apologize, I hope I made it understandable. Once you wrap your head around my lengthy writing you'll see it's really just using your brain and applying some common sense. It's just looking at the chart and going "cool, this is going in the direction I thought it would, lets enter another position since it's going so well and there are no indicators telling me not to". Super basic stuff, it's just convoluted and difficult to wrap your head around if you don't have anyone to show it to you. Discovering these tricks is much more difficult than having them shown to you. Good luck!!

The issue isn't in BCH creating their own currency with a solution to the proposed problems of BTC.. It's in their marketing.
BCH tries to position themselves as the solution to all of BTCs problems but the issue with them is their attempt to co-opt the bitcoin name. It's shady through and through, and the actions prove their shadiness. It's a complete farce, and anybody stupid enough to believe that BCH&gt;BTC deserves to have their money spent by Roger and his team.  Forking is a feature, yes, but Roger and his team are definitively a bug.
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:41:28
That's a fair assessment to make. 
I don't think that I need to do any persuading beyond what I'm doing currently. We are here ~10 comments deep on a thread in r/bitcoin. 
If Bcash supporters want to entrench themselves in their positions that's no skin off my back, but I do feel it's necessary to spread good information (and don't tell me that bcash is a legitimate coin and that I'm spreading misinformation). 
I may be mean, but what are the actions of Roger and his chronies? If no one is going to be mean to those who are primarily mean, then those mean people run rampant. I'm just doing my duty - as aggressive as you may find it, I find the Bcash movement just as aggressive.
I mean, Roger Ver could be at the forefront of Tesla and I would still criticize and bring attention to his actions. 
If I invested in a company that Roger was CEO of, I would unload 100% of my shares as soon as I saw him act the way he does during interviews. The fact that he got to where he is, is mind-boggling to me. 
He isn't suited to run a &gt;million dollar company, let along launch his own currency.

Bitcoin is the kleenex of cryptocurrencies. Even when it's not kleenex brand, we still call facial tissues kleenex. Same with Q-tip.
If you ask the average person about bitcoin, they'll tell you "Oh I heard it's a bubble" or "Oh I heard about that on the radio"

Oh yeah, but these days I'm just keeping a demo account active and making trades off of support/resistance levels and quick technical analysis/pattern spotting.
It all depends on the sizes of the positions you are opening and your leverage levels. You can make 200 dollars from 200 in your margin account if you take the right trade, but the chances of that actually happening are less than 1% and while the possibility is there, it's foolish to entertain it.  
I started with learning what the heck a candlestick chart was, and how it was used to trade rice effectively in the east when all the trading was still done on paper.. pretty neat.  I played on demo accounts for about a year before switching to real money.. I just used Cent accounts (where cents are the denomination) because I didn't have much starting capital. I ended up closing that account because the margins were eating up over 50% of my profits. It was too stressful. By the time I managed to save enough for a decent starting balance (3000) I moved on to cryptos, and it's been my focus for the past few months.
And yeah, you are totally correct with the browser game analogy. I took up trading after PC games lost their luster in my mid 20's. It's an excellent extension of competitive gaming. I feel like I had an edge on other new traders because I likened my time trading to my time playing competitive e-sports - keeping cool under pressure, self control/self discipline, and a lot more.  PM if you want to keep chatting I'm always happy to share knowledge/experience.

Spikes show us that people are buying in, not that it is becoming more valuable.
Current price during spikes do not represent the true value.
There is speculation that it is overvalued, and we wait for the price to plummet.
Price plummets, hits a resistance level, and bounces back up.
Corrections confirm two things for traders. 1)Yes, it was grossly overvalued. 2)it didn't get as low as it was before the spike, so some of the growth during the spike was genuine, and not a reflection of weak hands buying/selling during mania phase.
edit: good for calling me out.. I'll add this reply as an edit in my comment higher up to give some insight for others who are wondering the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:54:38
Because when it climbs with a stable rate, corrections are already factored in, that's what makes it stable.
Anything that goes up too fast is going to see a correction, and the correction provides information as to how the people in the market are reacting to the price climbs. We get an excellent visual of price support.
edit: Corrections show us that A)speculation of it being overpriced is confirmed. B)people are not willing to let it go lower than the support. So yeah, it's overvalued at 20k, but it isn't overvalued at 15k. So now we know that the true value on this day is somewhere between 15k and 20k. During huge shoots, we have no idea what the true value is until the dust has settled, we hit support, and bounce from it. **This correction proved that it was overvalued at 20k like so many of us speculated, but that it still showed growth since before the spike.** 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:02:01
It's not going to dip, sorry for your losses.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:31:37
I would encourage you to try it again. There are a few tactics you could employ to limit your losses.
Try setting stoploss, and set it tight. Stoploss closes your trade if it goes too far in the wrong direction. So if you happen to be wrong, you aren't logging back into your trading account with a position that's 500$ in the red.
When the trade moves in the direction you WANT it to, reset your stop loss to bring it in a little tighter, this will lock in your profits, so even if it does get stopped out, you moved the stoploss to be above your entry position, so it secures profits for you. 
At this time you also want to enter a new position in the same direction, so that when the price keeps moving, it's increasing the value of your first position, AND your second position, while securing the profits from your first position.
Rinse and repeat until you think it's time to take your winnings. This is called pyramiding, and it's a great way to multiply your gains while cutting your losses before they get out of hand.
Holding is hands down the best way to profit from bitcoin though, it's probably worth more to just do that and ignore the headache you described in your comment, I feel ya on that 100%

bitcoin growth isn't a bubble. When a bubble pops, that's it.
These are price corrections, and once they dip down they reload the spring that pops it back up 20x-30x. The questions isn't whether or not it's going to come back up after a dip, it's how many times is it going to dip and shoot up before the dips only become 5x-10x, then 1x-5x, then we will be in a stable price range and bitcoin will shift from a buy and hold market to a trading market. That could be decades away, it could be 5 years. It really just depends on how fast the rest of the people in the world adopt bitcoin

"If I compare my return to any trader’s, including hours worked, I get a divide by zero error."
Wrong. crypto traders never sell, unless an obvious correction is set to happen. When the price goes down, holders lose portfolio value, but traders still increase their margin account.
When the price moved from 10kUSD to 20kUSD, holders gained 100% portfolio value, but when it dropped to 15kUSD, they only ended up gaining 50% of their portfolio.
Traders on the other hand, gained the 100% portfolio value, locked in the profits, and then when the price dropped to 15kUSD, they made profit again because they shorted the asset and gained another 25% on their portfolio value.
Holders ended up with 50% gain, and traders ended up with 125% gain.
Holding is relaxing, but don't pretend it's more profitable than trading.

Not OP, but I can't touch my bitcoin until the fees change. I could exchange through GDAX and liquidate via litecoin, but they won't accept my verification despite emptying out my wallet on video. Every single other exchange I have worked with over the past two years doing forex and crypto has all accepted my verification. Coinbase is the first one to give me roadblocks with proving who I am, and I even went as far as to make a video with my face and voice and even my SIN number on it.

Your understanding of finance may be skewed then if you are unable to identify why corrections are good.
edit: Just copy pasting a reply from below so that this comment has some substance to it
Spikes show us that people are buying in, not that it is becoming more valuable.
Current price during spikes do not represent the true value.
There is speculation that it is overvalued, and we wait for the price to plummet.
Price plummets, hits a resistance level, and bounces back up.
Corrections confirm two things for traders. 1)Yes, it was grossly overvalued. 2)it didn't get as low as it was before the spike, so some of the growth during the spike was genuine, and not a reflection of weak hands buying/selling during mania phase.

You can exchange it to litecoin to send the value, but then I suppose you are stuck with your capital in litecoin, which is limiting in some regard.

All I want to do is use the gdax exchange so that I can change to LTC and get it out of coinbase. But they are making it impossible. 
They request that I submit both national ID card AND drivers license card, but they are one and the same in my province. I explained this to them, and they still refuse to validate my account so that I can exchange funds - not withdraw, not add, EXCHANGE. 
What the fuck is the holdup? Why is exchanging coins such a hassle that requires buckets of verification when you can link your bank account with only filling in a few text fields during registration.

MT4 is a program that allows you to access the charts of currency pairs. I think you can set up a demo account through the program, but it might ask you to link to a broker to do so. 
Google "forex demo accounts" or something like that, and there should be a plethora of brokers offering free demo accounts.
Please, if you do well in the demo account, don't open up a real money account right away. These demo accounts are designed to reel you in, as you probably know, so do some shopping before deciding on your primary broker.

I'm talking about foreign exchange where you practice analysis. Day trading stocks is the worst possible idea for an average joe to have, because there is so much insider knowledge that isn't apparent. A prime example of this is my friend who works in banking. He is the WORST trader I have ever seen, committing every crime possible like FOMO etc. But his portfolio is tremendous, because he knows exactly which days new stocks are going public and when his co-workers are buying and selling.
I get torn to shred when I try stocks, he gets torn to shreds when he tries analysis. 
For the average guy, I'd suggest learning how to read candlestick charts, learn basic macroeconomics, organize a bunch of reliable resources, and only enter positions when your analysis matches the analysis of your resources.  Don't copy their trades, do it yourself but use them as guides. Most people aren't capable of this because they 'don't like math' 'don't get finance' or simply are too interested in different areas of life to sit down and learn dry topics like trade volume and resistance levels.

This isn't a meme. 12 consecutive months. Most will win their first couple, and then they think they have the hang of it, and will lose the next 6.
12 consecutive months, and then ask yourself if you really want to gamble with your life savings (the only way you are going to have enough margin to trade correctly, for most people) as a profession. It's too stressful, and there is too many automated solutions that the average joe can take advantage of to make manual trading way more stressful than any ones day job should be.

That's my personal opinion. 
I think forex is a better vehicle for day trading because the sheer volume that gets traded on a single currency pair, like the GBPUSD. It's really hard to manipulate data when so much volume is being traded. With stocks, if someone who holds a big chunk of the shares ends up selling, the value could spike. 
With forex, there is so much volume traded that the technical analysis holds weight (look at past prices, and price patterns to determine the direction). And the only way that the price is going to shoot off in a direction is if you neglect to do your fundamental analysis (looking at what countries are doing with their central banks, trade patterns, economics, etc).
Again, that;s just my personal opinion. There are stocks out there that you can successfully trade back and forth, but you need to KNOW ABOUT THEM, which is hard to do without spending time every morning talking to your associates and reading financial publication - even then, you are still going to miss opportunities.
An example of one stock that trades well is (Can't remember the name, roommate is out of the house). It's an index of a group of natural gas companies. So why is this one specifically good? because the value of it goes up when these companies are selling more natural gas - aka when it's winter. Want to know my primary indicator that lets me know whether I should buy or sell? The weather network. not even joking.  Neat eh?

It's not a perfect analogy, I know. But boom and bust cycles are a byproduct of millions of *fallible humans* participating in trading during mania. 
It's irregular, and it would be nice if growth was stable but that's not the reality of digital currencies right now. We see stable growth in index funds and larger assets because they themselves are stable, and they are stable by design.
Bitcoin wasn't designed for stable growth, it was designed to replace fiat currency. There is no possible way that this will be anything but irregular and unstable, but I'm confident than when the dust settles it is going to be extremely higher than it is today. It's just a messy process to get there filled with lots of ups and downs.
I still say corrections are good because it indicates that there are healthy pullbacks that don't detract from the overall growth over the long term. It's an indicator for a healthy market.

Yep. the value is tied to how many people use it.
It might be slightly inflated right now, but I don't think there is going to be a drop down to 10,000. I think 15,000 is as low as it will go and then growth continues and we see 100,000 in 2018, with the same conversations happening about bubbles, dumps, shorts, etc.
But it won't stop there, as there is still billions of people who have yet to start using bitcoin.

Using TA on an instrument like BTC is retarded.
I trade forex primarily through TA and I'm profitable. It works on fiat currencies because there is so much goddam stability, but when it comes to something as volatile as motherfucking cryptocurrency in its first 10 years - you're gambling. Straight up.
TA on bitcoin is about as useful as TA on the roulette table at the casino.

Remind me in 50 years.
That's the timeframe we're talking about when we speak of "preserving wealth". Bitcoin is never going to be as good as land when it comes to wealth preservation - at least for our generation.
I'm bullish on bitcoin all the way don't get me wrong, but for parking your wealth? I can't believe people are actually saying that with a straight face.
Give it time before using it as a wealth preservation tool. It's still to volatile (example: today)

Collective consciousness. It's the idea that many people around the world are probably coming up with the same "new" ideas that your brain is coming up with at the same time. Some are older than you, some are younger than you. It can sometimes be a race to see who can bring them to fruition first where really good monetization opportunities arise. Neat eh?

Are people feeling fear because price has not gone up despite plentiful positive news? Bank CEOs publicly saying cryptos are powerful, blockchain developments such as RSK etc, Tx improvements such as lightning and segwit, just to name a few fundamentals that *should* have sent the price upward.
I think this is still a positive thing. Mostly because I've been short-cashed this month and have been unable to make my regular crypto conversions. Ok I admit it's fully because of that. Thank you lagging markets for keeping this sale on longer!

If you read the whitepaper, then you would know the answers to your questions: What makes the technology special? Why does the world need crypto?
The technology is special because it is the first of its kind and it opens doors to a countless number of uses and inventions that will better mankind.
The world needs crypto because governments are inept and are not as functionally efficient as private organizations or individuals.
That's as much effort as you are going to get from me because anything I say will just be perceived as dumb. (You're the one who asked questions that are answered by the fundamentals of blockchain.. I feel like I'm re-teaching a teenager how to do addition here and being called stupid for it. Good riddance)

Both positions in this debate are completely valid. It all depends on your position on bitcoins future. It's a meme because it's a complex debate that can be compressed into 9 characters asic '1btc=1btc'. It's said tongue-in-cheek because it's an endless debate that basically comes down to speculation on a new currency being globally adopted. It's a complete shit show, so we try to have fun with it while we're on the rollercoaster.

Good. It means it is undervalued.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:29:17
Price usually reflects value. The intrinsic value of blockchain is not being reflected accurately right now. The price fluctuations are being driven by sharks and whales, while the underlying value of blockchain remains the same. I guess we are still finding it, and who knows, the true value MAY actually be 6000$ and the december spike was just driven by the same traders/investors. Who knows. 
Just basic valuation stuff, really.

Is there a subreddit for this? It would be cool to have a collection of posts where people could browse through and try and recover some lost keys just on the off chance, like OP said. it's far better to donate to an ethical hacker than to have them lost forever. 
Would be cool to see some SOLVED tags by a couple posts, however unlikely that may actually be.

This is how I read my charts. I don't look for "is there a trade in here?" because exactly like you said, my brain will pull tricks on me and show me patterns that aren't actually there.
Instead, I ask myself "why shouldn't I take this trade?" And I begin criticizing my ideas. If I find that I can't really poke many holes in the trade, I open the position. 
It's a mental/perspective trick that works extremely well for me.

I had a conversation with one of my friends dads that has stuck with me. He stayed in the same neighbourhood he grew up in, stayed friends with the same people he was in a band in high school with, but the difference is that he owns a house, a couple of cars, a family, and never let his 'poor-person' vices get in the way of his work (like gambling and drinking and sports betting). He has kept the same job and worked his way up the totem pole. He didn't have a lot of options but god damn did he make things work when they had to, it's easy to respect him for that despite him still playing into his vices and dark side at ~50 years old (IMO you should have that shit figured out by then, but that's just me) 
He basically said that I should take risks while I'm young. I'm getting to the age where I feel myself respecting the dangers of risk much more, and I'm becoming more conservative. That window is closing for me, and I'm about the same age as you. Would I take my life savings and go down to vegas and gamble and possibly come out with 5x, 10x, 30x the amount? Probably not today, but that is definitely a risk I would have taken 5 years ago if I knew then what I know now.
The point I'm trying to get at is that the longer you put off making these big moves, the harder they will bite you in the ass because you will have less time to recover from them. They won't be as severe if they fail for this reason when you're younger. Doing this at 26 is infinitely smarter than doing this at 36. 
I think you should do it. Pull the trigger and earn your stripes. Take a risk that you feel in your bones but goes against conventional wisdom. Add some girth to your balls, my dude. You've put thought into this and you have an exit plan. 
My only advice would be to develop a buying strategy. For example, don't buy it all in one go (unless you believe the price is the lowest it will be moving forward). Look to buy dips and spend a % of your capital depending on how deep the dip was. Just some examples to steer your thinking in the right direction. If you do decide to pull the trigger and enter this position, you should be thinking about how you are going to enter very very heavily.
Good luck man, hope you do it. Keep us updated (or me at least, I'd love to know if you go through with this)
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:14:31

Problem: Transaction fees eat up a large portion of your capital if done in small chunks, cutting into your profits by a substantial amount.
Solution: Buy Litecoin. It mimics bitcoins movements and can be exchanged for bitcoin practically everywhere.
