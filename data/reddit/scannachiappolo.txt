hes been already wrong on dominance tho

because bigger blocks would require more data storage to contain the blockchain?  I see it reached 220 GB in 10 years, at this pace it seems discouraging to host a node for smaller entities regardless of block size. Can a checkpoint/snapshot system be implemented or it's impossible?

Wouldnt a 10mb block propagate just fine with today's connections? I mean if you are a geek with a bitcoin node you probably have optical fiber and good bandwidth

i've read that pruning is possible with bitcoin making the blockchain only around 0.5GB. Why would a bigger block size impact decentralization then?

Well normal people can't partecipate in the mining process already, what's the difference here? A node would only require good bandwidth and 1TB hard disk with bigger blocks, it's still much more affordable then mining.

Is the mempool located on bitcoin nodes?
How is the difficulty adjusted? How miners come to the agreement on the difficulty?

i'm trying to learn more about blockchain but i do have some doubts...
To have the balance of each address you need the whole blockchain since its inception and follow each transaction, so a blockchain explorer or similar tools do this job and keeps track of it and so does other wallets which are connected to bitcoin node, am i right? 
Are miners also bitcoin nodes or the two things are separate? 
What makes a transaction valid and how does it look like? Why a miner can't change the amount sent by a transaction for example?  
 If I or an app wants to do a transaction, where does it go? Broadcasted to all bitcoin nodes? Where is located this pool of transactions that miners pick from?
