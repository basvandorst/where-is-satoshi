Zane you should really take a step back from this forum for a little bit. Your responses may hurt the company moving forward..

I've made various purchases with my profits, i.e., gold, EgC sheets, an Xbox One + games, pillows, TaylorMade golf clubs but have never cashed out completely. I've been buying since $875 and all the way down to $180. I'm in it for the long haul.

It's already been proven that Trezor is less secure than Ledger. Ledger for the win

I love when coworkers come out of the woodwork to make bitcoin comments after reading about it on the news knowing I am involved. Where were their comments after the price increased $600 after I told them about bitcoin at $180.

We went from $1800&gt; $4400. I think some of that had to do with Segwit implementation.....

Over the last 4 years I've bought pillows, Egyptian cotton sheets, gold, an Xbox + games, TaylorMade golf clubs and gambled and I want to throw up. Luckily I have some btc left but all those purchases/sells make me feel uneasy.

I gotta say yes

I'm pretty sure a test was done by some expert hackers last year or two years ago where they were able to get into the Trezor but not the Ledger. I can't find the source so I might be making it up but who knows.

This is funny because I tweeted at him this morning a timehop picture from 3yrs ago where I tweeted at him asking about his interest in Bitcoin and why he didn't have any.
