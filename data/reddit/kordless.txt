It's basically the only Open Source project out there that provides a decent, fairly easy to configure cloud fabric management solution.  You can essentially run servers at home or in a datacenter that feels like AWS.

Don't forget about the threats he's getting right now.  I ran an ISP in Oklahoma City and got a death threat because I cut someone's Internet off for failing to update their credit card number.  The guy was the top orthopedic surgeon in the city and his wife literally pleaded with me on the phone to turn it back on.  She was crying.  I turned it back on.
Karpeles is probably scared off his ass right now.  There are some crazy ass fucks in the world and I'm sure one of them is up in his grill.  Or maybe several of them.  That's why they moved offices, most likely.

That would be a casual blaming statement made to increase the trust of the individual making the statement.
Technically to be 'accused of something' is to have formal charges brought against you by a legal system.  I'm pretty sure saying someone is an 'accused pedophile' in a public forum (and they actually haven't been brought up on formal charges for that crime) is considered to be defamation, which affords legal remedy here in the States.
Not a great way to start a conversation about replacing a 'corrupt' organization.  Conversation over.

The demo page launches the instances on either HP Cloud East (West Virginia) or HP Cloud West (Las Vegas).  You can also [use the script]( to launch an OpenBazaar instance elsewhere on our network, including Canada and Kenya.  Germany should be online this week.

I mine DOGE and buy BTC with it.  Everything should be decentralized, including the currencies themselves.

This has nothing to do with sympathy.  None of us here caused Gox to fail, they did that to themselves and their users.
Sympathy only works if you can do something about it.  You plead for us to not ignore the situation, yet provide no path to resolution.  The fact is there is absolutely nothing we can do but watch and wait.  And comment on the train wreck that is Mt. Gox.  It's really what humans do best, for good or bad.
Given the DECENTRALIZED nature of cryptocurrency protocols, the most logical thing to do is REMOVE the problems in the network that represent centralized pools of power.  It goes against the very thing that makes Bitcoin awesome: decentralization.  Mt. Gox is a HUGE fucking centralized pool of power problem, has always been a huge fucking centralized pool of power problem, and will continue to be a HUGE fucking centralized pool of power problem given their history.
Removing themselves from the ecosystem is the only possible way to solve this dilemma.  That entails their utter and complete failure, even if it requires taking down a lot of us (and I'm assuming you based on your fear based post) with it.
If you keep your coin in a highly centralized pool of power location (most exchanges) you are asking for pain and suffering later.  Move your coin to your private wallet, hunker down, buy coin while it's low, and wait for this shitstorm to pass.
At the very least this raises awareness.  The truth will float to the top and we'll all be better off for it, even if some of us lose out in the short term.
I'm sorry you lost coin with Gox.  Next time, don't park large amount of value in once place.
BTW, the first exchange that implements forced withdrawals to a predefined address (like mining pools do) gets my undying gratitude and business.  I'm not kidding, I'll totally use you if you do this.
Edit: Am I the only one here that understands centralized services like this harm the system?

Bitcoin is highly polarizing. Many people are already well into cognitive dissonance over it before your fingers touched the keyboard to write your comment.  Observation: Your comment has at least 6-7 blaming statements in it.  Blaming statements are created when someone speaks for someone else's thoughts or feelings.  "I'm pretty sure you haven't got the slightest idea what Bitcoin is." is a fairly strong blaming statement, for example.  This statement speaks for what the person does or does not know in entirety. Logically speaking, we actually have very little idea what they do or do not know.  Granted, they made blaming statements as well, but that doesn't excuse doing it back to them. A conversation rarely ends well with blaming occurring from both parties.  A good way to detect blaming statements is to look for the word 'you' and a verb indicating feeling or thinking something. Some people call these 'you statements'.  Avoid them and people who make them regularly.
On another note, I agree with your statements about Bitcoin.  I'll summarize what you said into something a bit shorter and on point:
Bitcoin is a network of computer systems which are, in turn, powered by electricity. The Bitcoin network is used to securely store information in a distributed, *trusted* manner.  Bitcoin is essentially burning power/value (electricity) to deliver what could be called 'computed trust'. Access to the network for read purposes is open.  Access to the network for write purposes is done via cryptographic tokens.  Storage of the data in the Bitcoin blockchain is, in theory, eternal and secure. People use these tokens for a variety of trust based use cases, which is what brings an intrinsic value to the tokens. The value of this tokenized, decentralized store of data is invaluable for solving issues developers face on a daily basis when dealing with trust in the products they are building. This is why Bitcoin, or at a minimum blockchain tech, will succeed.
And this is exactly why I'm bullish on Bitcoin.  So much so, in fact, that I'm proposing we apply it to cloud technologies: 
Thanks for the post.  I appreciate your passion for the technology!

Not sure I follow your negative comment. I'm not providing a OpenBazaar marketplace or a solution.  It's simply a demo that people can play with.  I'd insert a random pic here as a rebuttal, but I'm too lazy.

I like the idea of not having to leave a node running.

This argument is a fallacy. If you calculate return based on fixed buys of X amount of BTC, instead of fixed amounts of USD, it works out differently:
20BTC purchased at $800 costs you $16,000.
20BTC purchased at $500 costs you $10,000.
Gross value of those two transaction if BTC goes to $10,000 is $400,000.  The net 'loss' of buying at a higher rate becomes $6,000, which is a negligible (1.5%).


The answer is about a 1.5% loss, if you buy equal amounts of BTC.

Owner of StackMonkey here.
From a decentralized perspective, you may only be running a small fraction of someone's infrastructure.
From a centralized standpoint, ISPs have to deal with this stuff all the time, so this is NOT a new problem.  Providing services to individuals is distinctly different from participating in whatever the individuals are doing.  Car companies are not culpable because their cars are used as getaway vehicles.

While NVC will say he shouldn't make blaming statements, I'm 100% positive he doesn't feel heard here.  The only one that can alleviate this is Goodman.  In the meantime, he can rant and blame all he wants - he and Dorian have earned that right through their suffering.

While their communication methods may be less than ideal, it remains this attack cannot enable someone to remove funds from a wallet they do not control.  Given Coinbase was susceptible to this attack (which at this point is unknown) it would allow a customer of Coinbase to conduct a transaction and then 'invalidate' it immediately after it completed.  
This would have the net effect of draining funds from Coinbase's BTC 'buffer' account.  It would not affect any legitimate user's funds.
As Coinbase claims to park 97% of their coin in cold storage there would be an upper bound of risk associated with this attack vector over a given amount of time, even if they were susceptible to it.

I'm throwing non-violent communications out the window on this one:  You need to stop with your weakly supported biased arguments.  You asking a blaming question and then pleading for upvotes is ridiculous.
You aren't 'revealing' anything unique or interesting here.  You ask if we're all 'playing a game' then say that everyone is going to down vote you because you are 'right', without actually making a valid point.  Yes, life is a game.  That doesn't mean anything you say after it is true.  You are making an ad hominem argument.
As for the comment, that's simply not true.  The top link in 'more links' points to this:   That document gives you clear methods for acquiring coin, including mining.
Fuck off.

Whatever organization is formed as a result of the desire for an improved outcome, it surely won't be brought about by someone spewing negative statements about others.  I think you are out of line for making these types of comments.  Whether you believe that or not matters not to me.  I only care about the ecosystem and the success of Bitcoin.
The fact is, no central pool of control should exist that gives any individual or group of individuals a 'lever' by which they are able to do more work than others with similar amounts of stored work.  This is the Bitcoin way.  Pools of power suck and will not be allowed.
If there was a 'foundation' for Bitcoin it should ONLY exist to provide press relations (PR) for the effort.  The fact is, we don't need anyone to sit on a 'board' of a 'foundation' and make the decisions to hire a PR firm when we can do that ourselves using coin to fund it.
Solution?  Find a fucking fantastic PR firm who will take this gig.  Self fund the advertising campaigns by putting qrcode Bitcoin addresses on the posters, billboards, magazine ads, TV spots, Bart posters, etc. and MAKE THE THING ALIVE AND SELF SUFFICIENT.  The PR agency will shit money if they do it right.  If they don't, solicit someone else who will.
Take some time and think about what it is that Bitcoin gives us.  Use those things to start slowly changing the way we think about things moving forward.  Trust is the new hotness.  Let's use it to become better!

I'm a day late and a dollar short on this thread, but here's my take on it: Bitcoin will take off once the early adoption crowd figures out something useful to do with it.
IMHO, Bitcoin (or a coin built on Bitcoin) is PERFECT for doing infrastructure reconciliation.  Network, storage, and compute can all benefit from the trust of the blockchain.  Paying for and authenticating with coin is going to be the hotness that drives it.
