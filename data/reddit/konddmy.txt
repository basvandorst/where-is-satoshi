Just to clarify all this sh*t 
Literally 3 minutes of googling.
TLDR: not the onion

Actually if you’re on android (supporting OTG USB) - treznor integrates with mycelium wallet. Hardware wallets introduce their own risks however.

Wtf people? This is as old as Deadpool 1 doing the same thing 2 years ago, also no1cares. And not Netflix original - in my country (idn bout US) Netflix doesn’t even catch up with Agents’ episodes.

Ok, I agree. I'll edit my comment to reflect that

for small ammounts, apps like  bread or mycellium running in a relatively safe environment [that doesn't expose private data to other apps and has disabled jit (like ios)] might be used as a cheap and dirty alternative to a cold hardware device and easy to setup alternative to a cold software-based solution, but in either case, NOT a replacement.
To make it truly cold on the spot, as an exotic solution you could use (let's say) python script creating and signing transaction on let's say smartwatch with permanently disabled networking - so u could broadcast it manually from your phone (for example, using this:  The advantage of the latter is that you have a control over what logic is actually being executed on your device.
EDITED. Previous misleading version: "Breadwallet, for instance, is cold-storage ...but “thin” client of course - it doesn’t load the whole database to your phone."
Previous version of my comment was misleading as generally software by itself cannot be called a cold storage. Also mentioned mobile wallets can't work offline:
- bread-wallet cannot give you offline-signed transaction (as far as I know) so cannot be used as part of software cold storage setup.
