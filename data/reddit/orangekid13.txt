The IRS isn't who decided it would be regulated as a commodity, and you aren't the one that can decide to regulate it as a currency. If you don't want to pay capital gains on Bitcoin you can give it away.

It's the best way to keep it safe. Leave in on the hardware wallet, protect it and more importantly protect the seed phrase it tells you. And don't forget your pin.

Don't use a Google Voice number and keep track of your phone and you should be solid.

If they have access to your email but not your phone they can't get past 2FA. If they have access to your gmail, they also have access to your google voice and can use incoming 2FA auth codes to steal your BTC.

The 2017 peak started from 220, but lets say 1k for what the price roughly was at new years, and landed at 19.9k, rounded down that's a 9,000% increase. If we repeat that from 3.1k (we won't) the top would be 61.6k. That would be scary in a completely different way...
If you count from the bottom in 2015 to the peak in 2017 we went from 200 to 19.9k. That kind of percent increase would push the top over 300k. Not gonna happen this time around.

The base station will be licensed but I'm assuming it's an encrypted digital signal. HAM radio requires a license because you're the one operating the radio and you must comply with regulations. I don't expect the user would need an individual license since they don't have control of the device to change bands or broadcast. 
Satellite phones and existing satellite internet devices don't require the individual be licensed, why would starlink base stations be an exception?
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:36:04
That is cool, but ham radio requires a license and special equipment. While starlink will probably require a base station which will need a power source, the only line of sight that would need is to the sky.

I was even able to get the exact dollar amount I wanted. They should really let you enter either way and just do the math on the rate and fees for you. Not an instant buy though so my BTC won't arrive until Saturday.

Coinbase (if you're in the US) is great, I was able to buy in about 15 minutes. The week long wait is the transaction pending after you lock in the price but after the week is up you get the coins and can submit multiple transactions while others are pending. 
If you verify your credit card (as a backup source) and identity you can have access to the coins immediately but still have to wait a week to make more purchases from the same bank account.

The input is "bitcoin" which it's not interpreting properly. 1 "bit" does equal one cent, but that's not the input.
It doesn't mean it's wrong to know what a bit is, but it lacks the ability to work with "bitcoin" which is what wanted to do. I'm assuming they were trying to use wolfram alpha with bitcoin like it works with stocks.
