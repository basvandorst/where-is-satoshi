good intro to bitcoin video just overdone on the cex.io advertising, which was like 3x at the end

I still didn't get is Satoshi Nakamoto a real person, or not

Crypto-currency Conference in Atlanta on October 5, 2013.

I really hope it does not end up like Bitmit. The site was closed down when the interest was at its peak. The reason given by the admins was that they don't have the capability to deal with so many users and vendors. Hope that this site will be run by more competitive people.  Grin
BTW.... isn't Cryptothrift a P2P trading site?

While it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest that Satoshi would have links to an intelligence agency of some sort, the idea of Bitcoin being a purely CIA/NSA project just doesn't add up, not least of which because it's open source which is something that these people making the accusations totally ignore. Tor browser for instance was supposedly built by the American Navy at first and ended up being re-purposed but it's one of those things where you go "Why the fuck would an intelligence agency deliberately release something that completely undermines them and their government" the only thing I could think of is if it were some kind of person like Edward Snowden who got sick of them and decided it was time for some payback.
Like most of these 'conspiracy theorists' a lot of them like to represent these governments as big unstoppable forces that are out to destroy us and of course the only way we can fight them is by hanging onto every word that we say, while completely disregarding the fact that a lot of them are incapable of sending emails without fucking it up completely.

But that doesn't resolve the issue of it not being written down or copied before spending or trading, that is for private storage.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:07:57
And after this statement we still think we live in a free country, hah? I don't think so anymore

Oh my god. When I had a look at SR I remember looking at that captcha and wondering how they were locally generating such a high quality captcha code

I would like to see shorter confirmation time along with larger block capacity, without larger size. I haven't heard of a way to do the latter but I think if one was discovered it would be a major improvement.
As much as I'd like to see faster confirmations, the reality is that Bitcoin is primarily an internet currency and double spending isn't much of a risk for small value transactions such as a cup of coffee, but it would still be nice and help to address some complaints.
We are starting to run out of space in blocks though, especially since pools sometimes use lower than the recommended limit. Ideally, we'd find a way to store more transactions without increasing the block size.

Woulda, shoulda, coulda. 
Sounds like you aren't doing too badly anyway.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:44:45
i'm curious how they shipped illegal drugs/ guns to the buyer/customer?
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:19:02
Niot unless you're a miner. It wont effect the rest of us or the network if thats what you're worried about.
@_date: 2014-08-31 22:08:47
Bitcoin mining is very risky and you should only do it if you can accept that you might lose out.
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:51:39
Isn't here a contradiction? don't you think that Bitcoin ATMs make general public more aware about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:05:26
Looks nice, maybe I'll try it as well soon.

all hail the majestic genes...

this sounds interesting. krypto the world started to go into all the technology without exception. amazing development

BTC donations become more and more popular! 
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:51:18
Which would imply that taxation is not progressive. In a bitcoin economy, if the government depended primarily on sales tax, the rich and poor would pay similar taxes on consumption. Might not be considered fair.

I'm new here so sorry for the stupid question, but what's wrong with your iPhone? 
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:50:40
Everything is now speculation apparently with this. We say one thing at CCN, CoinDesk says alother in a matter-of-fact manner, then AhaMetals says something different. No one really knows why people do what they do right now, but my guess is that the downward pressure of big businesses like Dell selling bitcoins for fiat is causing the market to fluctuate, but to stay low.

Well if mining does not work out your dad will at least be able to play some games on that type of hardware.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:45:21
Maybe we need to quit worrying about making Bitcoin mainstream and let companies that take cryptocurrencies do part of the leg work for us as part of their branding efforts

Was a while back. They never mentioned Bitcoin. It is a shame. I was expecting Colbert to mention it considering the fact that he has included it within his program before.
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:20:11
Not being many details it could be a scam so best to not get too over excited until more details if they are, are released. On a good note though a bitcoin island party does sound like a lot of fun to attend.
@_date: 2014-02-13 10:01:25
I'm at the point of panic actually and when I saw this it made me instantly go and check - it is up and running.

I think political situation is not good enough in Israel. So i think they should think again about this conference.
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:30:06
I guess you won't use in the near future...
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:38:50
Pretty damn cool
That said, one would expect vendors on the campus of one of the worlds foremost tech universities to be enthusiastic adopters of new technology

After reading the article I realize how little I know of the whole BTC buisness.
@_date: 2014-02-13 10:49:01
This must be another nice try, huh?

bitpay do not trade as much as you think on exchanges. they do large private trades bhind the scenes away from exchanges. so the impact is not as big as you may think if growth was to increase really fast

What this enables now are startups that need some basic IT infrastructure that are in the Bitcoin Space to directly use their crowdfunded or VC (BTC) funded bitcoins for direct purchase of Dell hardware.

Off chain transactions will be the fastest way to get mass adoption. Of course that also requires trust so it will take time. I personally would love to pay for my coffee with bitcoin.
