In any biological evolutionary analyses, you should consider the cost to change. The change only will occur if the profits of changing surplus **by far** that costs.
There are no room for the "rational actor" argument in this question.

Yeah, I use mycelium as My wallet, but even using it is somewhat hard to find sellers in some places, I only completed two transactions on five months.
I thing bitcoin is not a thing in Brazil yet, even mycelium have slightly over prices when compared to bitstamp prices. I'm pretty convinced that it's the Brazilian equilibrium price.
Thank you by trying help me!

Yeah, I have PayPal, but you know that tax over financial transactions, yeah it applies to PayPal as well.
I'm looking for other Brazilians that would like to trade bitcoin in a little more fair rate, seems like they don't exist.

BitStamp: 1 BTC = BRL 680,38
Bitcointoyou: 1BTC = BRL 710,66
It's 4,4% higher, that was my point!

Acabo de lembrar que no Cartão, temos também a flutuação da moeda estrangeira.

Isn't that the coin that came to rule them all?
If it is only supply and demand acting, so bitcoin is not better than us dollars.

BitStamp: 1 BTC = BRL 680,38

* Relays on internet
* Relays in a peacefull world (If a war breaks up comunications of large amounts of nodes, the transactions may become inviable or invalid)
* Is based in hardMath (that you ca't stop talking about)
