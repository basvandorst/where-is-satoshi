It was beyond brazen of him to run a multi-million dollar online drug bazaar.  An example has to be set.  If people were allowed to get off on a light sentence for an illegal operation of this scale, others may follow and commit far more heinous crimes on the darknet.

How much of this can be attributed to the recent BCH pump?  How many % of it was a result of people buying the wrong coin?

We need to collectively create a webpage that has one message: BCH IS NOT BTC.  That webpage should be the first thing that shows up when people google "BCH" or "Bitcoin Cash" or "bitcoin core".  Is there any way we can make this happen?
