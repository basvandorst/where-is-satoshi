Yeah sure and FBI will go to her country to arrest her right? Cmon... let\`s be realistic. We can\`t do shit! Especially if they\`re out of US.

Type or stickers leave a residue. Magnets are clean also you can remove them easily when you will have a video call or a recording session

Watch it here

Also it's not 2018 but a 2017 documentary 
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:13:17
I don't know if I missed the part you mentioned the Credit Union's name but which institution was the one you talked to VP on the phone and she was very supportive about crypto?

I'm not gonna wear a suit just to open a business account in a bank. I'm there to give them my money. They better appreciate my business and my trust in them. If they don't then fuck it! I'll find other options.
@_date: 2018-05-11 04:34:55
Guys, we didn't really look like bums. We had sweat pants and nice shirts over`em. We looked more like we came from Gym.
But I see your points. It's really sad that we have to lie to banks in order to get business accounts.
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:17:50
I'm getting lots of ideas from people but everyone says the same thing. Do not mention the word crypto or Bitcoin. Just use general terms like software or computer industry etc. otherwise they won't open a business account for you. So I assume this is same for unitus also
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:27:37
Yeah thx. I mean why people are buying like crazy.
@_date: 2014-11-13 07:24:32
Less and less everyday

I hate that they have facebook verification. Also the site gives issues on my end saying please refresh the page. Plus cloudflare verification keeps popping up and asking me to enter capthca almost everytime I went to the site.
PS: I am one of those with early access also
@_date: 2014-11-30 11:52:56
So this is where he spent all those Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-11-13 09:25:07
He should be and then he should ask himself, what did we do wrong that the people hated this system this much?
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:28:28
At what price?
@_date: 2014-11-14 07:23:06
@_date: 2014-11-16 00:11:16
No. But I`m trying to access it from my country in the middle east
@_date: 2014-11-14 07:33:54
Visit Turkey :) there are many people interested in BTC here and you`re so close to us. I live in Antalya
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:31:21
Sorry. This was the first time. Actually I wanted it to go down a bit so I could buy more so I was kinda upset. But you`re right tho :)
@_date: 2014-11-14 07:42:23
and that was 16 hrs ago :)
@_date: 2014-11-16 00:14:39
Ok but that doesnt really answer my question.
1- what makes BTC more fair in terms of market manipulation?
2- you can never get caught for market manipulation in BTC. Is this not a bad thing?
@_date: 2014-11-13 07:18:45
Who still uses paypal now anyways?
@_date: 2015-01-16 07:45:52


What is that? I dont get it
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:59:05
It`s kinda late for Portland
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:58:26
Better call Saul!
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:58:23
I was hoping for an answer like this. Thank you
1- Majority of Bitcoins are also owned by just few wallets/people. So Ripple owning majority of XRPs doesnt technically make it centralized
2- If the company gets shut down, that apperently wont kill the network and will leave it to the community and users right? Now I didn't understand how community validators can cheat each other? Is it possible? if so how?
I personally really dont like XRP at all since the begining. But now people keep coming to me and saying it's decentralized (because of this and that I rote in the post) so I want to know...
@_date: 2018-10-01 03:58:16
I\`m not gonna risk of having him sending bunch of who knows what stuff to 9 of my friends.
@_date: 2018-10-01 05:06:00
I agree. Pretty sure you`re right. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 08:38:01
You may wanna look up the difference between "investment" and "gambling"
@_date: 2018-06-05 01:04:15
You're right but it's the matter of giving up on your company and going back to job market or not
@_date: 2018-06-05 01:02:39
İ was expecting it to down too. This is very normal in this market but didn't think it'd stay down this long and at this price. İ thought we were done with 4 digit numbers
@_date: 2018-06-24 02:40:20
Look at when did i created this profile before attacking right away dumbass. Isn't it just super easy to bully people without even looking at their profile instead of try and understand?
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:04:05
I`m not gonna sit down and try to prove myself to you. I just wish you looked at yourself before attacking other people you Mr. member since 2016 the real deal OG.
I`d still respect you if you actually wrote something useful because anyone can know something I don`t know but you`re just trying too hard to bully.
So maybe consider talking to people who can actually be at your level and take you seriously. I don`t really have time prove myself to you.
@_date: 2018-06-05 08:35:53
I should clear out few things...
1\- Call me old fashioned but I'm not interested in investing anything other than the top 5. So don\`t come to me with other coins to invest in. As most of us know &amp; of the coins that are out there right now are just tools to make few people rich.
2\- I\`m not interested in buying your Bots. For solid reasons. Successful bots are never for sale. Because each bot exploits an opportunity which loses it\`s value when more people exploits it. That\`s why I have my own bots that are in trials. Of course they may just not work at all. We\`ll see.
3\- I\~m not interested in buying your technical analysis. Mainly for the reason that I don\`t believe technical analysis works most of the time when it\`s applied to crypto. I don\`t think there\`s enough stability and data to analyse and come up with right predictions when all you can do is to use the same methods you used for years in stock market. When you think crypto is anything similar to stock market, you lose me there right away.
4\- I\`m not losing money. I\`m a big time proud HODLer. But I\`m not making enough money to pay my bills anymore. That\`s why I\`m looking for other smart ideas to make money in crypto world. Not ICOs or buying bots or buying technical analysis. Also I should mention that I never trade with fiat. It\`s always crypto\-crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-05 05:55:27
Oh sure... i believe you. I’ll put everything i have in that coin and just sit down and wait. It’ll make not just me, everyone rich... for sure. No doubt there at all
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:46:42
What year was this?
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:51:24
You cant login there with the email. It asks for your Wallet ID which also we dont have
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:33:41
This is a market. The rate will go up and down and in crypto currency world the environment is very volatile. So he should know all these things and then just go for it.
It will go down for sure though just like the last few days... But we, as Bitcoiners all believe that it will go back up and it will go up super high eventually
So wish him luck and tell him to keep it up!!!
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:44:04
How come it shows the halving will be on 2020 and you guys are talking about this crap now already? 
We have bigger problems to deal with like CHINA and KOREA and IRS
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:01:46
My recommendation is "Rise and Rise of Bitcoin" it`s kind of an old documentary (3-4 years old) but it really shows the early stages and how this all started
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:04:12
Can I see the math you did to come up with these numbers?
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:22:39
QT Forever!
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:19:07
I guess your comment after my comment explains very well that Bitcoin is for everyone...
Even for you :)
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:41:43
Thx for explaining but I don`t get it. I`m sorry.
If I have 1BTC and I sent 0.8 to someone, the remaining 0.2 is my just remaining balance.  I`m not sending that to anywhere else. I don`t understand why my sender address change while my remaining balance just stays in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:53:03
What is a change address? Is it like a mask to cover your real wallet address? so It`ll be more anonymous
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:19:56
You should be very much proud of him. Pick a wallet, buy some BTC and then teach him. Teach him especially about the movement and the reason of the Bitcoin`s existence
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:05:07
I guess Im a brainless zombie also. But Im making pretty good money from my Bitcoin FB Group.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:16:25
What is a replay?
OMG, I`m so behind this and there are tons of things to read and most are pretty technical things. That`s why I wanted some simple, summarized info.
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:57:02
I couldn`t really find any good info on this. Can you please explain more about it? 
Airdrop has matched the LBC amount in your wallet and gave you BCH?
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:44:26
Oh wow, does it actually get sent back to your wallet? if so, after how long you get your money back to your wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:58:19
EVEN? socialists... really? even?
I think socialists defend Bitcoin more than others already. Because they`re the ones who are most against the banks and corps.
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:48:04
Because the point of that boat existence is to cross the river with none to super low fees. Remember that was our biggest selling point up until the last 2 years...
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:23:39
I`m  a little confused. What I understand from your message is that I will get my airdrops and free coins no matter which wallet I keep my BTC in as long as I got my priv keys.
But there is a possibility the software may not recognize my Core Wallet because it won`t see the segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:54:12
What do i search in the search bar?
"What happens if you`re running Bitcoin Core when the fork happens? or the segwit2x or whatever the fuck is going on nowadays" ???
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:12:03
But why would they do something like that? just to make the transactions more anonymous? like they mask your real wallet ID and create a new one to send the coins from?
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:27:38
Let me guess, the number is 1800-Satoshi?
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:28:41
What do you mean at the time I submitted? Are there cheaper times of the day compared to busy times or something?
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:25:36
Is the reason of golds existence to replace fiat and be used as a "currency" ?
Well Bitcoin has that mission since the day one
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:35:46
So if we have our Bitcoins in the Bitcoin Core Wallet (QT) when fork happens, are we not going to have the airdrop of the new coins?
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:51:24
Also yes, astronomically low fees FOR astronomically low amount. I thought Bitcoin was the best solution for micro payments and our best selling point was the "Fast + None to almost no fees" transactions. What happened to us?
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:06:23
It just really bothers me that this person gets paid to write an article in NYpost. Do they not have any standards or qualifications on their writers there? WTF?
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:26:36
It is for me and it is for everyone but it`s not I guess it`s not for micro transactions nor it is to be used to buy a coffee.
Does it hold value? yes. But it`s really not so much more convenient than gold at the moment
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:03:36
I can do that for public APIs but I dont know how to do it for private apis where there is 50 digit api key and then a secret
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:05:18
I dont want just the data like that. I want my own data to be automatically pasted in an excel sheet in a specific cell so I can automatically compare those numbers to other investments etc.
@_date: 2015-03-02 06:15:31
Instead of creating competition in the market, I think you should help the OpenBazaar
@_date: 2015-02-17 11:42:37
Can someone to please focus which exchange site is this???
Instead of the freakin passwords
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:50:43
Holy crap dude! You tip literally everyone!
Dont get me wrong... I just want my share :D
