My advice would be to relax, but don’t make this a legal trading advice thing, I give this bona fide! 
Buying at the top happens to the best of traders. 
Re Bitcoin, two main rules! Don’t FOMO buy into a unsustainable price development, and more importantly DON’T panic sell once you did. This thing has got legs to run. 
Trading generally is more of a psychological game than anything else, especially atm. The price is likely to continue a correction until there IS futures around, and then not much will change to the original outlook and we’ll continue a stiff bull run as the uncertainty gives way to renewed confidence.  
Most big banks like JP Morgan et al only allow SELECTED investors to future trade BTC, and most only allow futures on LONG (price appreciation) contracts because risk is too high to collateral them otherwise because of brutal volatility and mass sentiment, aside from a tremendous fundamental base on which to rationale BTC value. 
A gazillion people (your grandma?) panic sells and or locks in profits atm and that is why the price dropped like a hot potato. DON’T PANIC SELL! We’re still above the high from some DAYS ago. Later tonight future trading starts officially, and as soon as people realise that not much has changed the price will go gangbusters as confidence returns. 
3) 
Banks and other institutional investors would be stupid (and as immoral as they might be, they aren’t stupid) to play the 500 pound gorilla card and throw 500million sell orders/short orders into the rig tonight, or this week for that matter. If that’s their plan they will do so when few expect them to do so. Not tonight, not this week. Maybe after the next monster wave to follow. 
You could consider to HODL a percentage of your equity until doomsday as a core position and ignore all the noise in the market. I do so, the JP Morgans et all can go and suck lollies, they won’t get any coins of mine for any price. They should neither get yours. 
5) 
Patience is King. Buy dips, accumulate, don’t freak out when a correction comes, the worst thing that can happen is you have no equity to buy more for cheaper. 
6) 
Like any market, and probably worse in crypto because of the psychological impact of extreme volatility involved, a herd runs a certain direction in panic or excitement and wolves run alongside the herd and bite the ones on the fringe. This here right now with BTC is a case in which the majority of investors hold, the herd still runs a major uptrend, mind you. Grandpa and Grandma with  TC on their smartphones are freaking out right now. In a correction, the wolves bite those that panic sell and thus they buy up their assets for cheap, in bull runs they bite the ones that cash in despite the ongoing momentum. 
Don’t be a sheep and let the wolf bite you as you panic sell. Realise that the herd is running towards profits in the future, and if you stick with it and don’t drop out on the margins towards the wolves waiting for you, you’ll be frolicking in the direction of the previous uptrend.
These corrections do happen, it’s normal, and required for markets to breath fresh air. Don’t buy expensive and sell cheap. Accumulate when it’s cheap. 
Source: I’m a wolf! 
TLDR: Don’t FOMO buy, don’t panic sell. HODL, you have little to nothing to worry about.

HODL is a thing for me and so many others because all the Goldman Sucks and greedy short terms “investors” can get farked as far as we’re concerned. 
So many people crying out loud for government backed stability and state sanctioned security and endorsement, as if that was a thing, completely missing all the points and potentials. 
So here goes the rant of the day, and I’m not even remotely salty in any way, before the haters bring it up. 
Fuck you! Bring the cheaper prices, I’ll add to the position... It’s my Bitcoins. 
I’m not fucking selling, the show goes on.

There’s an inherent risk that the information and thus access to the funds will be lost forever. 
Just some reasons why I do not consider this good practice:
-	Accident involving brain damage/memory loss
-	Early onset dementia
-	General forgetfulness in humans
I would argue against that route of memorising as good practice.

The acronym KYC stands for “Know your customer”, a requirement to gather information about the counterparties which is imposed on exchanges that facilitate transactions of cryptos (and various other financial services) in many countries. The rationale is usually to impede money laundering, tax evasion, organised crime and terrorism financing. 
In Australia, and many other jurisdictions, these requirements are becoming increasingly stringent by requests from AUSTRAC or equivalent authorities for such businesses. 
I hope that helps.

It’s the same mistaken argument that is uttered against government surveillance and the creeping incursions of the surveillance state more generally.
“They can spy on me all they like. I’ve got nothing to hide.” you hear some people say. 
If you’ve got something to hide or not is not the matter at hand, and is a limited and self-centric view with only temporary relevance. If one agrees to leave any such behaviour by any superior force unchecked, they’ll be next in line on some topic that DOES concern and involves them. But by then it’s too late to wish for a change that has become personal and relevant at once.

BinanceUSD (BUSD) is Binance's own 'stablecoin' presumably pegged to the US dollar.
Turns out they experienced "liquidity issues" when, someone \*cough\*, emptied the BTC/BUSD order books. This wasn't hard as the liquidity appears to have been about 600.000 BUSD according to [reports](
So during the flash crash, BTC was on sale for BUSD 1800. Convenient bargain, and some punters sold their BTC in exchange for some measly amounts of BUSD.

Well, as an understatement that sure sucks for those that had sold BTC for a presumed equivalent of US$ 1800 as a result of stop orders, bots or whatever. I won't say it was Binance themselves, I'll leave that up to public imagination. But someone bought BTC for dirt cheap. What an arbitrage opportunity if there ever was one!

Oh my dude!!! 
Your imaginary economics degree gives you such a tremendous competitive advantage to lecture us all and let us rejoice in your unparalled wisdom that  


Yet, you can’t even get the most basic policy frameworks and concepts of authority as pertinent to the United States economy [straight]( In fact, it’s exactly the other way around than your statement. As a refresher: 


Monetary policy is a term used to refer to the actions of central banks to achieve macroeconomic policy objectives such as price stability, full employment, and stable economic growth. In the United States, the Congress established maximum employment and price stability as the macroeconomic objectives for the Federal Reserve; they are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Apart from these overarching objectives, the Congress determined that operational conduct of monetary policy should be free from political influence. As a result, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency of the federal government. Fiscal policy is a broad term used to refer to the tax and spending policies of the federal government. Fiscal policy decisions are determined by the Congress and the Administration; the Federal Reserve plays no role in determining fiscal policy.
Yet, you come to this sub to lament about how much more clever you are compared to the presumably big pool of cognitively impaired riff raff that doesnt hold an economics degree. 
If you truly hold an economics degree, you probably have a solid understanding of value for money. I‘d ask my university for the tuition fees back!

That’s both incorrect and misleading. Taxation agencies have tremendous capabilities largely outside the scope and knowledge of the public, virtually limitless financial resources, and the legal power to put them to work. 
In my experience, the “smart ones” out there acting as you do, or at least suggest to do, end up in deep, deep shtuck and frequently behind bars.
Aside the tax man, there is few enemies you can make that will come down on you harder than a ton of bricks. They relish running into people with this sort of smug attitude.
