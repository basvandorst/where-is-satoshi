You cant. You just have to wait and see really..

You really cant back up these claims with proof. Really they are just intuitions and like everyone says, no one truly knows whats going to happen. If we did, we wouldnt have so much doubt would we?

Not advice, just a personal story. I had the fear of the prices being too high and unprofitable at 5k. So I didnt buy. Had the same at 10k so I didnt buy. At 12k I said if it goes back to 10k ill buy. Now its sitting on 14k and I am not going to go back on what i've done so I invested.

Its so crazy. Went down to 18k for a moment and i went to message friends about it. Check again after and its back to 20k!

Of course he is, not for the money, but to rub it in my face :')

Same situation as you. I get this rush at the thought of buying now but also a drop in my stomach thinking that the moment i invest, itll drop. BUT. Im going to do it. If it drops, ill buy more at that price. If it rises, i profit. Eh?

@_date: 2017-11-28 22:14:34

I remember when it was at 3k and my brother told me to buy some.. I was so stupid not to, believing bc it was at its peak back then, it would go down...
