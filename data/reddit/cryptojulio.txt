Yep. The mixer create a flow of transactions that keep things hard to untangle from the outside.
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:30:49
I did same in August 2017.
But your timing seems better than mine :)
Good luck and happy leveraging!
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:01:37
Oh. You are in denial. See you at 7k lol
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:59:46
Thank you Nostradamus. Luckily you are here to make us rich.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:59:28
So you are basically saying the price will go up at this point. You are pretty contradictory.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:41:38
BTC dominance going to the roof
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:47:20
Oh god that’s so true. But in a bear market it’s better to be a dumb bear than a smart bull. ����
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:45:50
Oh yes. you are. 
Try to buy Bitcoin now if you have some balls and believe it can be bullish this year. Lol
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:29:05
Do you understand where crypto adoption is right now ? We are at less than 2%. 
So no, the BTC train has not passed long ago. It’s still only the beginning.
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:29:52
It’s the reflect of inflation! Price is not going up. It’s buying power in $ that decrease. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 06:59:02
Agree. Gold is for oldschool investors. Bitcoin is for the internet generation. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 18:50:36
What to get ready if we don’t know ? Lol
Buy gold and BTC I would say. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:17:26

Ahaha true. Dramatic world loves drama. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 19:06:36
Yes the volatility is shutting down. Sign that the bitcoin super cycle is almost over and ready for a new one! 
@_date: 2018-08-23 07:09:33
Start with max 10% of your capital if really you want to... if you put more your emotions will keep you away from the success 
@_date: 2018-08-23 07:11:25
Same. I’m holding only alts and I’m very down. I wish I could buy some BTC now but too much money involved at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:15:12
Exactly. And now is panic on crypto market. So even more volume. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:19:56
This is the one million question. Will bitcoin become a safe haven when stock market crash ? 
I like to think that if bitcoin regain popularity and start a new bull run by EOY or beginning 2019, while stock market start crashing, it’s a nice timing of a transfer of value. But I have to admit it’s only my hope... 
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:45:22
We love FIAT because it’s still usable in real life ans trusted by the mass. We love FIAT until it falls and lose it trust and value. At this point you will truly LOVE bitcoin. Or you will HATE yourself if you sold too early. ;)
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:21:19
I'm 31 years old and have about 85% in crypto. I just keep the minimum to live in FIAT. I sleep like a baby because I'm super confident about the futur in medium and long term. Digital economy is starting from now. No turning back.

Lack of volatility means market cycle is complet. Now slowly preparing for a new one. If you survive to cross this desert you will be rewarded well.

It makes a lot of sense thank you :)
In any case I hodl like a spartan ! 
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:43:36
So you mean the crash will benefit crypto market ?
I’m not sur I understand everything that you said. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 22:42:39
So wait for it to go down. But don't cry if it doesn't move down anymore lol
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:02:48
That's a good point! How to check the authenticity of the thing ? Someone ?

Dude, you really have time before the big bull market in 2/3 years. When we reach that point, the crypto ecosystem will be more evolved that now and you will probably be able to spend directly your crypto without cashing out to pay your bills or even loans. Or maybe some regulations will allow long term holders to cash out it in an appropriate way (with some private company maybe) to help and secure a big profit cash out without risking a funds freeze or worse. 
Anyway, it’s not for today and you probably don’t want to sell today. 
So relax, and let things grow! One step after another. 
I would finally conclude to slowly start changing your mindset. Start thinking more crypto and less fiat. 
Bankster money is not reliable for the very long term. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 13:58:25
What analysis you provide ? You just show candles and some moving averages. I don’t see anything else here. 
@_date: 2019-11-23 06:09:47

@_date: 2019-11-14 08:06:55
We have a lot of common points. I’m also leveraging my life in a similar way and have similar vision. Next year I plan to live in a camping car. So I’m totally with you dude, go for it. Your life will be better in both ways. You will grow spiritually and in term of money eventually. If you already know how to manage risk your life will be rich, with or without money.

@_date: 2018-10-24 10:24:33
I have entered the crypto market last september with a loan of 20k€. I know everybody saying it’s a terrible thing to avoid. But I don’t have this mentality. For me as an investor it is a normal process to borrow some money to make a natural leverage in the long term. When you invest in real estate, you have to borrow money to your bank to run your project and generate a cash flow, right ? I apply the same process here with crypto. And the good thing is that you don’t need as much money as for the real estate. A five digit number is enough to trigger nice profits in the mid/long run with cryptos. Of course now I’m in the red with my portfolio because of this bear market. But I manage my risk. I have a job that generate a salary to absorb each monthly refund of the loan. As long as I don’t sell my cryptos I’m not losing anything. So I just need to wait few months to be in the green again, and in few years I’ll thank myself to have borrowed some money and took that managed risk. Once again, it’s just a matter of strategy. Of course don’t borrow some money to trade, in this case it’s a perfect way of loosing your money. But for a buy and hold strategy it’s just perfect to borrow! It’s like buying with a leverage but with no stop loss. It fit me as an investor so I’m perfectly ok with this :) 
@_date: 2019-11-06 12:05:10
We (as hodlers) are buyers. Not sellers. 
We will convince you to buy BTC the day we will need to sell it.  
But the next FOMO will convince you to buy. So we don’t need to.

90% of fiat money is already digital. Only 10% is paper. If all people decide to withdraw, banks cannot satisfy them. If armageddon strike, we go back to basic. Bitcoin and fiat = same same in case of global apocalypse.

Stock market crashing, nobody talks about bitcoin now in the media, volatility super low... best time ever to buy. I’m doing the maximum effort to put some cash in BTC right now. I will thank myself later. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 13:53:46
Move to Binance. Fundsa safu ! 
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:28:40
Yes. It gives -75 to -90% down from ATH. It cannot really go deeper. So it’s a good thing to start long positions in this area I think. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:30:28
Yeah. Make sense. I’m already all in since the last dip. Now I’m floating around the break even point. I just wonder if I should go out and come back later sub 5k. But it’s a mind torture to go out and wait hoping for the price to drop...
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:10:06
Yeah. I think it’s the minimum time needed for human mind to put the last FOMO out of his mind and start to trust an asset once again. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:34:11
DONT. TRADE. CRYPTOS. 
BUY. HOLD. TAKE PROFIT DURING FOMO
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:37:22
Agree. With strong volatitily is very hard to hande this kinda stop loss. Better to estimate the big target with TA. It’s much more easy when the consolidation pattern is clear and long in the time. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:41:35
Lol. It's exactly what's happening. How can you misunderstand this ?
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:44:46
Of course it will recover! Learn about the life of a speculative asset bubble. They all have the same steps. Capitulation is one of the last, with all people saying "it's over, the dream is finish, bitcoin is dead, go back to work, bla bla ba" and after that step the market slowly go back to a healthy growth. It's been like this for decades if not century. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 08:19:27
Possibly yes, probably not. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:34:02
Fomo is when your hair dresser and your taxi talk about investing in bitcoin. It’s when media attention is at the maximum. Then it’s the right time to take profit and wait for several months to buy back. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:58:10
Damn I fear that's true. I feel this shit smell more and more on reddit. Last step of bubble burst incoming. And I think it will not be the more confortable to live....
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:19:46
Banksters scam 2.0 
They are always creative to find new way to get our money. Avoid this please guys. 
They don't buy now because it's easier to borrow our cheap bitcoin that we hold for a long time before they jumped in the game. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:47:02
Lol. You want the market to capitulate faster than it's able to. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:42:51
I think we only enter capitulation step. Long term hodler only start to leave the market. Still a long way to go for the next cycle. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 07:24:07
Thanks for the explanations. 
But if every crypto consumer think btc will go to 4800 they will probably sell more or capitulate, leading price to this target. I don’t see any obstacle for this. You ?!
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:51:00
Oh yeah bro you are so right. If I become a millionaire after starting invesing late 2017, I will have a good story to tell my kids
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:28:35
Yes, this is what makes me think that the bottom is here or close, and that we will start a new cycle in the coming months. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:55:25
That's a god damn good argument. I'll keep it for all the stupid people who blame me with this false bitcoin problem. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:58:30
Exactly. FOMO are irrational. Just like bubble burst. No links with global rationnal context. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:11:30
Why so negative talk? A lot of people are talking of positive things here
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:37:27
Please stop trying to give reasons to irrational market. Crash are the opposite equivalent of FOMO. No reason except emotions of the seller that are stronger than emotions of the buyer. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:30:13
Yes. That’s crazy to read the crypto sentiment here day by day. Actually Reddit is a good tool to watch market sentiment and detect peak of the bubble and despair. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:59:19
I pray for this truth. Can't wait the next bull market
@_date: 2019-08-17 13:54:20
Yep I am :)
If I could borrow right now I would do it. 
But I have shot all my bullets already. 
Now waiting 2023.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:50:06
Don’t say it’s irrelevant. Say you don’t use it. 
It’s just a measurement.

@_date: 2018-06-04 11:45:40
Wow that's not good. Far too many coins and in and out moves are the worst you can do. Focus on very few coins and hold them. Do not trade please. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:42:51
Ahha same mistake. I had 100k if I just took that fckin profit. I won't miss it next time. Hold is good, hold and take profit is better ! 
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:51:06
Bro please just learn about what a market cycle is. Then come back and you will know how to buy and hold bitcoin without emotion and fear. 
@_date: 2019-08-24 18:10:12
No. Wait one or two years. We need help to build a strong FOMO that will make us all rich baby.

@_date: 2018-06-04 11:43:58
Yeah bro just keep it and forget for a while. The market is stabilizing now and should grow up slowly in the coming months. Now is a good time to buy more if you can, but for sure not selling any crypto coins! Hold on !  
@_date: 2019-08-17 11:00:28
It’s a good leverage idea I think. 
At least you can buy and hold. 
When people does margin trading with long leverage positions, they take the risk of loosing it all if the prices goes south. They can’t fully buy and hold. 
So it’s a yes for me. Borrow, buy, hold, and be happy in few years.
@_date: 2018-06-20 08:20:32
Stop fearing. Learn more and your fear will disappear by itself. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:52:48
Exaxtly my case. I am about to enter red zone. Just wonder if I should hold or sell and buy later
@_date: 2019-10-17 19:11:54
It is totally psychological dude. Even more in the crypto market. People buy and sell with greed/fear. Who buys here for the tech? Less than you can imagine.
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:36:19

Lol. Who’s first: the chicken or the egg ? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 08:28:03
I exactly entered long at the beginning of this graph. Now I am back to april lol. I feel so stupid one more time to not take any profit one month ago. 
@_date: 2019-08-11 08:03:17
Nice prediction. I like the timing with halving and global idea. I have similar scenario in mind. This mini bubble is similar to the 2017’s one.
@_date: 2019-08-10 17:21:44
In the last cycle, ALTs only started to move after BTC has reached previous ATH. 
So why should it be different now ?
Reaching Bitcoin ATH is the true bull market confirmation that we need.
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:37:22
Yeah. It make a lot of sense. I am fully agree with you. But I can also imagine instutionnal money starting to flow during Q4 and make a new FOMO and then after a real crypto winter. Or not. We will see. :) are you holding now or completely out and waiting for more capitulation to buy back ?
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:27:57
There is 20 cosmological constant in the universe. (Mass of a protons, electric charge of a neutrons...). Number of bitcoin is the 21st parameter to set the univers. 
But the answer is 42. 
If someone can hack bitcoin blockchain and double it, he can solve the universe.  Chuck Norris is not qualified. Bogdanov is.
@_date: 2018-06-21 08:10:17
I was talking at you this way because sometime it’s easier to see the peak of the bubble with mass psychology than in the chart. Yes. The same. Now I’m eating my nuts to not have taken a profit during the f**** peak. But we have to be realistic. There is no asset in this world that can sustain +2000% or similar in a short amount of time without going back for a while. Next I take profit for sure. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:32:52
Man you are so damn wrong. Bitcoin is so far to be a currency used by all country. So few people just own a tiny part a bitcoin. You can say that you have capitulated (before the market has really shown any sign of capitulation yet) but god please don't say it's game over. The market has so much space to grow up with the mass adoption that will occur in the coming years. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:39:06
Holding for holding is a non sense. 
I think the best strategy is to buy, hold, and take profit during fomo/mooning action. Require very few trading but offer big ROI. But for sure, don’t day trade guys. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:39:28
Captitulation incoming. 4000$ soon
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:06:16
In this way it’s rational. But we use to say irrational for the link between value and fonctionnality in real works. Of course it’s also subjective a lot. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 07:29:52
Some have stopped because they have "capitulated". It's typical from bubble market as I said previously. Once the market show bull sign they will go back to their position and accept bitcoin in no time. 
@_date: 2019-08-10 20:29:07
Look better at the chart my friend. Alt season only start when BTC reach last ATH after the krach. I carefully watched the correlation with ETH/XRP/XMR/LTC. they all did the same.
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:59:34
I see this during summer. Everybody will enjoy their sunny moments and nobody will care about bitcoin. Maybe september we will start a new rally ? 
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:24:17
BTC break 20k$ during Q3 or Q4 of 2020. 
Next Bubble peak in 2023. 
Mark my words. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:07:19
I’m only worried that I cannot buy more cryptos with fiat before the next bull run.
@_date: 2019-10-17 11:48:13
Lol you just said one thing and it’s opposite. The market is only guided by psychology. You understand market like my grandma.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:34:28
Oh. You should be new in crypto lol.
Price going vertical ?
3 years of bull run ?

No. Being a day trader means only using a technical frame at short time frame and having a risk managment. The volatility is not the problem if you know what to do in every scenario by advance.

Exactly the same. My BTC transaction in unconfirmed for hours... 
@_date: 2019-02-23 08:47:03
Congrats for selling one year ago. 
But if you are smart enough for doing this (sell at the top) you should be smart enough to understand that now is perfect to buy back (buy low). 
Why do you ask this question, smart guy ? :)
Or maybe you sold because of luck ? Naaaah I can’t believe this. 
@_date: 2019-08-02 09:05:44
Agree. We have a replicate of the last 2017 bubble but with smaller scale. The mini bubble has to burst first.
@_date: 2019-02-22 12:20:44
Thank you for this solid argument and your light on top of that ! 
@_date: 2019-02-02 20:13:56
Oh thank you for that. It’s the price action you are right. But I was thinking something more visual. Any way to see it with candles and chart ? 
@_date: 2019-02-14 15:54:01
without any time consideration, your question is totally irrelevant. Sorry :)
And if you decide to rephrase it with time, nobody know the future. So... sorry again !

@_date: 2019-02-09 21:41:11
No bull run before spring 2020 guys. Keep this in minds. 
2019 will be a boring range between 3k and 6k. 
We won’t break out before the next halving.
After the break out institutions will enter. That’s the moment where you can call it a true bull run. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:18:41
Omg. Epic darknet purchase. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 12:19:37
Define what time frame you want to play and stick to it. If you wanna be a day trader then stick to a solid strategy. If you want to be a holder then intra-day volatility is not a big deal. But please define the reasons of you being here first. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:36:21
You didn’t understand what I said. I was talking of the climax in your chart in the Red zone when you say « hodl ». It’s stupid to hold in these zone without taking some profit. That’s what I said. 
I didn’t mentionned the move we are seing now.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:20:37
Hodl during climax is a non sense. Just take some profit and don’t be stupid after hodling during few years. No profit are made by hodling for ever.
@_date: 2019-02-02 21:34:59

Bitcoin is not the cause of hyper inflation. 
The fondamentals of any fiat lead it to be hyper inflated over time. Look at deutsch mark back in the previous century. Look in Venezuela or Zimbabwe by example. When the fiat system start to reach it’s limit, govs has no other choices than to push the money printing so hard that the inflation goes to the roof and the purchasing power of the people goes to the floor. That’s a fact. So yes I am speculating on this because we already have a lot of proof that it happen all the time. 
So when I say that when BTC price will hit one million it’s not the cause it’s more the consequence. 
Global bitcoin adoption looks to me very nicely synchronised with the decline of the most famous fiat € and $ in the next 5 to 10 years. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 13:47:28
Yeah that’s a damn good quote. I agree. 
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:21:45
Why not using bitcoin ATMs ?
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:47:18
May I ask when you first buy some bitcoins ? When was it exactly ?
@_date: 2019-02-22 08:32:27
When bitcoin will hit 1 million per coin, fiat money will be hyper inflated. So relax guys, it will hit this damn million. But it won’t be the value of a million dollar from now. When it will happen you will buy a coffee at starbucks with 100$ lol 
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:33:27
Use your eyes better. Facebook and reddit are full of crypto noob asking if they should invest now these days. We have a bubble right after the bubble. It’s going to be painful for some

Of course I don’t believe you because I travelled by myself in poor countries. 
I have been in India several times by example. They ALL have a smartphone in their pockets, even if they are poor. Every teenager and adult have one because the technology is cheap and available. You have to go in the remote village to find people with no smartphone, but these people are not the mass. 
The mass is in the big city, they are poor, and they have smartphone. They can install crypto app and buy or share crypto between each others.
Plus, people like Zuckerberg are working damn hard to provide internet to remote location with drone and laser technology. It’s already working. The internet is covering the world. You should update your infos.
@_date: 2019-12-02 19:48:36
Let’s hope no bears are remaining around and ready to sell! 
You might be true on this one.
I like the fact that the price has quickly bounced on the 6500$ mark. It looks like a solid level of support. 
Let’s see!
@_date: 2019-12-02 09:23:13
Well. With crypto the game is changing. The poor can finally participate the financial game and buy something that can behave as safe haven: Bitcoin. 
So if a crisis happen, then can decide their faith and hedge if they want. This crisis may actually help them to rise because they will have this power to raise their small capital from all the markets in bubble and the fiat falling all around. 
Such a crisis wouldn’t be a fatality. It could be an opportunity.

I’m chocked to see a new bubble only 18 months after the last one. This market is insane. 
Soon this second bubble will burst and it won’t be cute to watch. All noobs who came in crypto space after the crash are going to get rekt the hard way with no lube.
@_date: 2019-12-02 12:33:21
So what about the private key? Its not the one associated with the public key on the watch. Right?
@_date: 2019-02-24 07:33:36
You are too impatient. 2019 will be a long accumulation phase. No ATH so quickly. 
Only 2020 we will see a true break out of 10k$ and later new ATH. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 06:44:19

@_date: 2019-12-02 19:16:50
Practically nobody? Do you have numbers ?
Without any opportunities to start accumulating ? Can you tell me how ?
Almost everyone can buy bitcoin. It’s easier than having a bank account in poor country.

@_date: 2019-04-06 11:13:56
Don’t think a crash like we had can be followed by a true bull run. It’s impossible. We need one year range first and before everything else. 
So the chances to see 3500 again are very high to me. We will create a kind of 3500-5800 range for all 2019. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 17:51:44
You are confusing how reality should be (your dream) and how reality is. 
Not only government teachers are paid for the knowledge. 
I’m an entrepreneur and I’m selling my expertise to people who wants to know what I know. Am I a bad person because I don’t offer it ? No. Because I also have bills to pay and project to fund. 
I worked 10 years to accumulate some skills and a vision. It’s valuable for some people who wants to save this time and learn it more quickly. So there is a price for this to pay. 
If you don’t understand this, I’m sorry to say that you only deserve average quality free informations.

I bought cryptos with a 20.000€ loan. I’m in the red like most of us but I sleep like a baby. I know the market will recover and in less than 3 years I’ll be able to pay it off. I have an investor mindset so I’m ok to invest with borrowed money. That’s the price to leverage some project in life. I can focus on my work now and everything’s gonna be ok in few years. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 07:53:52
The fact that there is no sellers is not a reason to believe there is a lot of buyers at the same moment :) 
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:25:14
Agree. Avoid bank moves as much as possible. Stay on your favorite exchange. Some altcoins are actually pretty strong during bearmarket so you don’t need to cash out. Look at binance coin and dogecoin. Very stable during 2018. Could work as stable coin and even make profit if you can swing them. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:56:18
It’s perfect and I agree. More time to accumulate. The next massive FOMO is more likely to happen in 2020.

I hate this FUD argument. Some of my friends also told it to me. Anti crypto people have found a serious thing with this argument to manipulate the mass and uneducated people
But you can reply that:
1) Bitcoin is a young technology and will evolve a lot just like the internet in it’s early days. It’s useless to extrapolate energy consumption from now. 
2) there is a lot of other industries now that are consuming huge amount of energy and participating to global warming, more than Bitcoin (palm oil, automobile industry...)
3) Bitcoin is such a strong solution to a lot of problem in this world. Pointing out this temporary default and hiding it’s quality is like saying internet is shit because it consume to much electricity. It’s stupid. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:28:31
Yes. Some people prefer to buy low and sell high. I really don’t understand why. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:39:06

Good boy. You just have short term view. I’m here for the long run and I’m patient. I’ll be rewarded for this even if I didn’t buy at the best moment. Don’t try to give lesson to people by starting to judge them. You just can’t do that. It doesn’t give any credibility even if you achieved some random business in the past.

Honestly I understand that you can’t get enough of the memes things with noobs investors. But I find this very useful to track the market sentiment and to check where we are in the bubble. I think we really need these signals as investors to see our direction in the medium term. According to reddit people and their meme, I’m pretty confident that we are in Capitulation. I’m not sure that I can identify this without scrolling all the reddit memes and comments! That’s give me more confidence to hold on to my coins and I sleep like a baby even in the red. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:49:58
Exciting time !
I was waiting for that fckin capitulation for months. Very happy it happen finally. After the big wash out we will start a fresh cycle.

Where exactly is the bullish divergence ? I don’t see it. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:19:47
I have just finished a statistic analysis of all medias/youtube/subreddit available to know if this is the last dip or not. 
The answer is 50/50. 
No need to say thank you ;)
The only question to solve the problem now is:
How confortable you are with the psychology of risk and control in your life ? 
If you are confortable with risk and don't care about absolute control: buy now and live your life. You'll cash out in 3 years. 
If you are not confortable with risk and don't care  about control: leave the cryptospace asap. 
If you are not confortable with risk and care about control : wait until you can't wait anymore to enter. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:34:49
I would just reply 1 BTC = 1 BTC it’s ok. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:29:00
Do you trade to accumulate or only buy more with fiat on a regular basis ?
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:03:09
Please learn about market cycles. All cryptos are followings the same steps. 
- accumulation with low volatity
- break out
- volatility expansion with steady growth
- parabolic growth with high volatity
- crash
- price compression and fall of volatility
- and so on... 
Just zoom out and see it on all charts
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:46:50
Honestly I don't know. I just know that in France we are often few years delayed to understand new tech and paradigm such as crypto, compare to the rest of the world. Others countries are better educated than we are.   
I am just happy with the yellow vest movments because it can increase interest for cryptos and adoption.
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:40:48
I am french. Most of my value already out of bank account in crypto. Proof of keys, proof of cash! 
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:23:56
Cryptos are not sensitive to censorship directly. But our centralized exchanges are. Politician can ask to shut down few of them if really they feel in danger. In the coming years we will have the rise of decentralized exchanges. At this point, governments won’t be able to control anything in our wallet. It will mark the historical split between money and state.

You really think this is a content ? Taking old data back is not creating anything. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:39:05
You spotted it!
It's very similar to 2014. 
First time since that moment that BTC price cross two times the 200MA. it's smell bad. 
But IMHO it will not last two years, the market is more mature and dynamic. I think it will last between 6 months to one year maximum (from the last ATH at 20k). I still think we could have an entire 2018 bearish year. But I prefer to hope the market will recover around summer and start a new bull cycle. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 08:17:24
You can always find a solid TA that push the point of view of the person. That’s why I don’t look anymore at others TA. It’s sooo biaised by each POV on the market. 
Try it by yourself. Imagine that bitcoin will go lower, and you will start to draw lines and build argument that will defend this POV. The opposite is same. 
Finding the exact bottom is a stupid game. 
2019 will be boring range at the best. Start an accumulation strategy now until the next bull run, instead of trying to find the bottom.

@_date: 2018-03-27 06:02:10
Yep I agree. That's why I think it will last 3 to 6 months to recover. Not 3 years. 
Maybe this summer we finished the crash...

@_date: 2018-03-26 20:36:51
Look back to 2014. 
The past teach you that a full bitcoin market cycle is about 3 years. We just ended one. 
I feel that 2018 is almost only bearish. 
We will meet bitcoin back around 2/3k$ (return to the mean) and the bearish cycle is over and we will begin a new accumulation step before it grow and make a new FOMO in 2/3 years. 
Just my humble opinion! 
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:25:05
Yep. But it will last 2 years down for stock! 
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:33:50
Yes of course. But you can learn how to identify a bottom structure. Any strong bounce from here will wash away the sellers a create a nice bottom. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:21:15

@_date: 2018-07-28 12:11:45
Great stocks ? Are you sure you want to invest in these stocks with such an overbought level and full wall street manipulation ? It’s risky as hell. Same as buying bitcoin at 19k$ last year. Better to invest in less known stocks with low prices and no parabolic curves. 
I have decided to not show Tesla because the curve was not so simple (parabolic curve) to understand.

There is a lot of barrier for institutional money dude. You really think institutions can buy bitcoin with there billions on binance or kraken like you and me ? They need secure platform for this kind of transactions and we don’t have this right now. The market was only fitted for small investors, not for institutions. Moreover OTC is not for everybody. 
When some structure will be deployed to allow institutions to buy, it will start a new bull run. Institutional FOMO will be crazy huge and drive to market to tens of trillions market cap. I’m just quoting Charles Hoskinson, ex co founder of Ethereum. And he is not the only one to know that.

@_date: 2018-07-22 07:34:50
Are you for the long or short term?
If you are for quick profit, wait for an eventual new bottom. But there is a probability bitcoin will never bottom again this year. 
If you are here for the long term (3 years or more) honestly it’s a great time to buy. Bitcoin has already retraced 70% from last ATH and won’t go a lot deeper. If we go for another bottom the price won’t stay very long at such level. So being few % in the red for a month or two is, in my humble opinion, an interesting risk to take if you are for the long run. In both case (with or without bottom) you will be happy to have started investing now, in 2021 or later. At least now you are sure the price is nice. If you wait to much, you take the risk to buy bitcoin at 10.000$. For the long term it change a lot for you final balance ! This is where the real risk is, for me.

Not a pyramid. It’s an exponential growth. A technology adoption run with a sigmoidal curve so it’s normal to find a logarithmic growth for bitcoin market. Once we have reached global adoption, the market will reach a plateau and will stop growing this way. Bitcoin has a lot of time and the market a lot of space before reaching this. Million per token is definitely a target. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:47:42
We are talking about different things. I’m talking about technology adoption, and that phenomenon occur with a sigmoidal curve. You are talking about biosphere and other things. In this case we can’t agree, because we talk about different things.

Bad story bro, but I have learn the lesson from this also. Holding an asset during a bear market is a non sense. But now it’s time for new investor to come for buy and hold. So now it’s the moment you really want to hold. Please don’t trade or sell at loss. Now is the time to really be strong and hopeful.

I’m here from June 2017. Right now I’m not panicking at all even if my holding is plumetting in fiat value. I’m pretty confident about the tech and the futur. My only emotions come from the fact that I didn’t wait enough for this kind of price to buy. I try to accept that I was not patient enough to remove any negative feeling toward myself. That’s life. I’m learning. I know I’ll considere myself as « smartmoney » during the next bull run, even if now, it looks more like « dumb money » lol. For sure I feel that this bear market is deeper and longer that I was expecting. But that’s not a surprise hey? Timing the market is absolutely impossible. That’s the main lesson I have learn this year.
