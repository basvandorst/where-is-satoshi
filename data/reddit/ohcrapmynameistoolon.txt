Incredible, every single one of you guys is a complete moron here. I have been in for long and the way you guys act make me sick. 
The fact that you guys are being blind to negativity is the only reason the fees are up so high right now. I want Bitcoin to succeed but be reason it’s not at the moment is that everyone here refuses to accept negative points like this guy made up here.
Being open to negative points of your investments opens up room of improvement, looking at every negative comment as FUD will only fuck up your investment. It’s not gonna make you rich if you ignore the problems, idiots.

Can’t believe it, it was happening enfront of my eyes, knew it was happening, knew it was gonna happen.
Somehow I never considered Bitcoin an investment, telling all my friends “Bitcoin is the future” while dropping all my money on altcoins like NEO.
Don’t get me wrong, I have been with BTC since 2015 December but I’ve never seen it as an investment. Even made a lot of profit on altcoins. I’m still really happy to see BTC smashing ATH after ATH. It meanst the cryptoworld is getting more recognition, even if it’s just because of the forks. Unfortunately I will have to watch this piece of history from the sidelines.

Just a very idiotic picture/post, if you invested $1000 in Bitcoin in the beginning. Bitcoin might not have been what it is today. Just imagine if someone would have had 1M+ Bitcoins

I lost $160K if that makes you feel any better.

I can’t wait for $192.512.000/ Bitcoin in 6 years ����‍♂️

Bitcoin has the biggest market share, it’s paired with every altcoin. Most altcoins are in its infant stage, they are starting to get developed. 
Bitcoin is the face of cryptocurrency, once it tanks, it drags altcoins with it because it’s paired with them and most of the time it indicates how the market is feeling. Once Bitcoin starts stagnating and starts swinging less, that’s when altcoins start to grow.
Your question, why should we invest in altcoins is simple. Do you believe in the technology, vision and the team of the cryptocurrency you’re investing in and what real world problems they are trying to tackle. If so the answer is yes, altcoins aren’t Bitcoin, a lot of them don’t want to be Bitcoin they want to be their own coin/company whatever.

Just looked at your post history, all you’ve been doing is spreading negativity? What’s the deal?
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:41:21
Dow Jones goes down, stocks go down. What’s the point of keeping stocks?
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:22:01
Pretty sure it’s been my anus for the past week
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:19:48
It’s not supposed to be an argument, it just makes all your points a little bit less convincing if all you so is spread negativity. I understand your points, but I don’t see why you’re still here after all these weeks of continuos negative talk on everything really. 
Edit: Don’t get me wrong, I am not trying to defend Bitcoin/ cryptocurrency, but it’s not healthy to be in this negative mindset for weeks on end.

I’m pretty sure his entry point none of your concern. 
Don’t let the $20.000 ATH cloud your judgement.  If he doesn’t feel like holding anymore and the thinks current resistance levels won’t hold up and decides to cash out a piece to buy at lower price it’s his decision, and that is called profit taking or cutting losses. If he did so last week he would be up 20%, if he did the week before 30%
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:04:49
Securing profits, why would you hold if you think current levels won’t hold? You’re making profit if u buy back at lower levels..
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:59:35
But you’re using Bitcoin as a means to an end right? I am not using fiat, I am using Bitcoins to achieve my end goal.

I have 1400 NEO, never sold, lost about $190.000.
I’m 21 years old and was too greedy

Well, you’re using Bitcoin to buy things of off Amazon right? I don’t see how my post is perceived as something negative towards Bitcoin? Or te community
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:03:05
First, the crash, destroying longs, after that the pump which destroyed shorts.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:10:53
You’re buying Amazon balance/ gift card directly with your Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:11:59
Well, actually no I can’t because I said “ I don’t have a credit card” and you didn’t read what I actually said instead you’re trying to find another reason Bitcoin is bad.
Edit: Fun fact: You can now use your used PS4 games to buy anything you want! Simply sell them and use dollars to buy what you want? Why stop there? You can actually search for bottles and return them to the stores to get deposit back! Wow! And did you know that if you find 10KG of apples and sell them you can actually buy groceries! Amazing
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:18:37
Actually, see my post history, it’s the first time I’ve ever mentioned the website. I simply use that site because I don’t have a credit card and it’s something that I’ve never seen mentioned. Why would I get anything from that website? Do you see it mentioned anywhere else? A referal code?
