It's a bureaucratic black hole that doesn't do very much for education, but people act as if public schooling would collapse without the DoE.

So...has No Child Left Behind been a positive or a negative?
Has Common Core been a positive or a negative?
Do you think its necessary that students in all very different and diverse from one another 50 states receive the same education as enforced by the DoE? 
Should a student in rural South Dakota be forced to learn the same things as a student in the Bronx? 
Do you think a student in the Bronx should learn the exact same things as a student in rural South Dakota?

I believe that $0.89/dollar taken in ny the DOE goes to its own bureaucracy, not the schools/students.

I could become a barber. 
But wait- I have to pay to go to school and get a license. And then I have to rent a second space because I'm not allowed to work out of my house. So now I have a license I have to pay each year, and rent+insurance on two properties to be allowed to cut someone's hair for a few bucks.

What if the regulations are what's holding you back?
