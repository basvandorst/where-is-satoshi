lol, the point is that the more people on reddit the better potential for discussion, hence we want reddit to be crowded. So Not sure why we need your website to discuss Btc. also the is bitcointalk forum.

True true, but I was just to tell that the volatility in crypto is so many times higher than stockmarket and therefor you should be prepared to stake bigger swings. If people have a hard time handle the ups and downs in crypto they are to exposed. They need to have more in stocks and bonds. If you hold 90% in stocks and 10% in crypto a 33% hit to crypto won't be to hard because that means total value only went down by 3%. Everybody can tolerate risk differently.

If you need to sell then you lost money, But in 2-3 years this might be a tiny dip. Crypto goes up and down, just get used to the ride a see the bigger picture.

look at coinmarketcap.com Check some of them out, check their websites to see if you like the project. 
I guess it depends on what you believe in. Personally, I am invested in Basic attention token and Substratum just to name two. I believe in the project. I would say keep maybe 40% in BTC and 50% in projects you think will make it long term. The last 10% can be speculative investments, small-cap coins under 100 million market cap. The last 10% should be coins you think will beat BTC short/medium term. If you don't like riskier trading or don't have to time to research then put the last 10% in BTC also. 
THIS IS JUST MY OPINION, it is not financial advice. 
 To keep everything safe long term holds should be on a hardware wallet, like the ledger nano s.

At some point in time BTC will correct to 50% of it's value is my prediction. But it could be now or when btc hits 25k. But at some point a major correction will come. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:46:50
I have no idea, Assuming we get a 10% of all value in the world is store in crypto and BTC keeps it market share thats a 25 trillion marketcap or about 60x more than now. If BTC keeps it marketshare, you will see btc be worth almost 1 million per coin. Your $100 could at that time be worth $6000 dollars. However assuming it takes 10 years getting to that point, the you have to count in inflation bringing your $100 dollars today worth around $7500-8000. So don't expect buying a house for those $100 dollars in the future.

Saxo Bank however is pretty bullish on BTC. They predict the price next year will go to 60k

lets say you a going from Earth to the moon in a rocket. We might be ready to land now, or we are still waiting for people to board. The prices are just going up now because you have to buy a ticket from a person already on board. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:36:55
Thats a good point, people will cut loses before it is going down under 10 k I think, and after that it will go a little further until the whales buy back in.

my portfolio has gained value, but I have not made any real money until I sell:) Merry Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:28:04
the thing is, you have to be 100% sure you know when it will dip and buy back in before it rises again. Yesterday at somepoint BTC dropped $1000 dollars in 20 minutes and 5 minutes later it was up $1000 again. First rule of investing is to not lose money.

Move on, don't take an ex back. You will ultimately damage yourself more trying to get her back than the short term hurt you feel moving on.

True haha, But I think people worry way to much about the daily price fluctuation. It is not the stock market, if a stock goes down 20% in a day you have to worry. If BTC goes down 20% in a month then you have to worry. The daily ups and downs of crypto in december represent almost 1 year worth of priceaction in the stock market. 
 So if you take a look at 2007-2008 the stock market went down a lot, but i recovered in 5-7 years. Right now BTC goes down a lot, but in 7-10 days we might be back to new highs. It could also take a year to get to 20k.

My portfolio is rising again right now. And so are yours, cause the whole market is gaining again.

Read the books - "the millionaire next door" and "rich dad, poor dad" that will help with the mentality, next invest 20% of your monthly income in a diversified portfolio, I would say 80% stocks 20% crypto. Wait 1-50 years depending on salary and ROI.

This is my "Dream car" well that least the kinda affordable dream car.  
Hopefully, it will cost a lot less. But then again if we get a 50% total correction next month, it could take 6 months before we are back again where we are now. (maybe worst case scenario) but I think it would be a good idea to not hold all money for it in crypto. Just for safety. 
Anyway happy for you.

You can buy a lambo or and lollipop. Seriously if I knew how much bitcoin would be worth in 6 months or a year, I would probably be taking home all the loans I could right now assuming it is higher at that time. 
On a serious note, BTC is at an alltime high it stands for a correction at some point, but then again it might not correct downwards it could just go sideways. 
You can buy on coinbase.com, do I think you should buy it, sure why not. if you can afford to see your investment go lower in the short term, you will probably come out ahead in 6-12 months. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:29:16
If you buy now be prepared to hold through a dip, but if you think bitcoin with hit 1million pr coin in the future, buying at 9700 or 9200 will probably not make a difference for you at that point, you will just be happy you bought when it was still under 10k. 
Short term trading it is most likely not the right time to buy, but I have no conclusive answer.

obv 1 million per coin is a little high investment perspective, but I agree if it actually becomes a currency we can't predict the final outcome, will it be that Japan use it as a main currency or with it be a global one. If It becomes the global currency then just holding $100 worth now will be a small fortune in the future.
