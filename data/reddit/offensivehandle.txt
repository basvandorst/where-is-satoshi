it's only by profit (or loss) you aren't taxed on the entire stack every time you make a trade. correct me if I'm wrong

I'm gonna post my rookie technical analysis for shits and giggles... first time please be gentle 
In the short term, BTCUSD is in a descending wedge looking at the 2hr chart from 6/26. After the $13.8k high and flash crash on 6/26, the price began a series of fairly quick up/down movements with high volatility and high volume on downward moves. The intersection point of this descending wedge is around $9600 on 7/05. 
$13.8k is the 61.8% fib. retracement level from the ATH high of $19.9k to the bottom of the slump at $3.1k reached in November of last year. 
In the long term, BTCUSD is trading inside an ascending broadening wedge looking at the weekly chart from 4/01. The weekly candle for 6/24 is a shooting star with a small body and massive upper wick. 
Here's my Scientific Wild Ass Guess^TM on the price: the current down trend will continue until BTCUSD breaks out of the descending wedge. If it fails to break out at $96xx the opening price of the 6/17 weekly candle (preceding the shooting star) of $8977 will be the next support. Once the price breaks from the down trend I would expect the rally to continue with the next top at $16.3k, the 78.6% fib. retracement level. 
comments and constructive criticism welcome :)

price is trading close to the resistance line on the descending channel. what are y'alls thoughts, bull trap or breakout imminent?

appreciate the comments. 
how come you think it will maintain sideways movement? historically it's been pump and dump lol but the peaks progressively get higher and higher. for example:
* April 2013 - $257
* Nov 2013 - $1166
* (long recession bottoming out at like $211)
* Jan 2017 - $1157
* Mar 2017 - $1375
* Jun 2017 - $2987
* Aug 2017 - $5079
* Dec 2017 - $19.8k ATH
* (long recession bottoming out at $3.1k)
* July 2019 - ????
I'm curious on your thought process. Because I think ATH will be surpassed but I'm not sure when it will happen.
