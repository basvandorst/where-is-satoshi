who said redzone is $10 ?? Redzone is only $6 a month and your provider gives you redzone for $15 that's first difference . for $10 you get all games plus redzone plus archive from 2011 till current day . third your provider doesn't support all devices while streams on my website can work on all devices ( Xbox / PS4 / iOS / Android / PC / MAC / Apple TV) and quality is 4500kbps 60fps
