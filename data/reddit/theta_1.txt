bitcoinfees.earn.com has useful information (all the transactions breakdown) but its recommendations are horrible. They recommend whatever fee will get your transaction in the next block, when most of the times you would prefer paying a tenth or even less and wait a couple of hours. You should look at what fee level the number of pending transactions is thinning out versus the number of confirmed transactions and set the fee yourself.
This website is actually doing more harm than good with its recommendations because by recommending high fees it pushes up fees for everyone. Even right now that transactions under 10 satoshi/byte get confirmed quickly, people enter new transactions with fees higher than 200 satoshi/byte! The moment a few of those get stuck, this will become the new required fee for everyone (for real this time). Do yourself and everyone else (except miners) a favor and set lower fee!

If Electrum runs in a dedicated VM is it/could have been affected? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:43:02
Or a mobile that you put on your desk
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:55:50
Thanks, good to know for the future.
For the past, does this means that Electrum inside the VM was vulnerable to this particular attack all along, or was it safe because I was using a password for the wallet? (Ignoring privacy concerns, I only care for the btc safety for now)

If you empty account 2, will the funds in account 3 still show? In other words, when the software looks for unused addresses, does it take transactions or only end balance into account? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:47:37
It is mentioned that funds are safe if password is used. Would it be possible for an attacker to get the private key during the signing process (for a transaction or for signing a message)? 
In other words, ignoring privacy concerns, if we had Electrum with a password, and the bitcoins are still there, and we have now upgraded to 3.0.4, do we need to move the btc or are they safe?

With Revolut the transfer and the fx conversion would have been free. It would take 3-5 days to arrive to Turkey though.

it wasn't 152 BTC, 152 was just the very last print, if you look just below at the exact same time there were prints at higher levels. The order was for much larger size and it took the entire order book all the way down to 1 EUR.

If I want to send a transaction and I'm not in a rush I will put the lowest possible fee and wait. Right now with time off activity including trading (record volumes) and wallet coin splitting (because of BTG), it's normal to hands high volumes. This is no evidence of spam/bad actors. 
Btw, when I split my coins between BTC and BCH (moving the BTC to new wallets) I paid less than 5 satoshi per byte. Transactions were confirmed the next day. When I recently moved the BCH I tried the same but the lowest fee that allowed the to even be in the mempool was 6 (sometimes 7) satoshi per byte. Is this a feature of BCH?

Wealthy people don't have more than a tiny fraction of their wealth in cash, so your comparison is invalid. 
Typical example of a wealthy person: lives in a mortgage free $5m house, has a few more properties worth another $5m, has $10m in stocks/bonds, $2m in bank deposits, and maybe carries a few thousand in actual cash. What percentage of his wealth do you think can easily be stolen? Compare that with someone with 99% of their wealth in BTC. Whose wealth can more easily be stolen?

It's more than $10bn (right now at least) because it includes all the forks

Quite interesting analysis. The one thing I'm not sure about however is whether it's a bit tautological to compare the market cap to the value (as opposed to the number) of transactions. Of course there's going to be a high correlation between the two (which is the basis of the first chart and what the whole analysis rests on). Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:53:48
it's much easier to steal than real estate (expensive house) or regulated securities/bank deposits

So for off exchange transactions? And they trust them over regulated exchanges?

Thanks for the writeup. There's still something I don't understand. Yes,technically the  NYA was dead when bitcoin cash was forked. But given the risk of a new fork, would it hurt to increase the block size to 2mb in the core so that there's no need for a fork and core keeps going? Where's the harm in that? And where's the corporate takeover in this case if core developers still write the code? You give them the 2mb, you shut them up and you move on. What's wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-09-30 06:35:24
You mean for storage or to transact? In either case where does a broker help?

One more day of GBTC outperformance compared to NAV. Right now GBTC trades at an equivalent of more than $7750 for the sum of 0.92 BTC and 0.92 BCH, almost 75% premium to its NAV.

So you agree to hire someone for say $60k a year when BTC is trading at $600, so you sign a contract where his salary is stated as 100BTC, then the following year BTC goes to $6k and you are suddenly underwater. 
Then you learn from your mistake and you decide to hedge yourself, so you hire another guy for 10BTC this time and buy 2000 BTC to hedge future salaries. 
Then the following year BTC goes to $1k, your second employee demands a big raise or he will leave because he can't even pay the rent, but you can't do that because you already hedged your exposure and are out of cash. 
See a pattern here?

Sorry, I wasn't clear. I know very well what a broker is. But a "bitcoin broker" sounds like almost an oxymoron. How does the contract handle things like private keys ownership etc, how is the broker regulated, these are things I'm curious to see.

Regulations for financial instruments allow distinction between custodian and beneficial owner. I am not sure how this works in the bitcoin world. 
Also, the bar is pretty high in terms of regulation compliance to be a broker (high fixed costs) and I find it hard to believe that someone would be a broker just for bitcoin as it would be hard to recover these costs just from this.

Dumping continues, $4147 now, and other exchanges follow on the way down (possibly traders arbitraging?) 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:46:15
What's the point in doing that? Waste money on exchange fees, both ways, and the employee runs exchange rate risk.
