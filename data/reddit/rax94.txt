I have sent BTC from Exodus to my Coinbase and then imported old exodus key into electron cash. It's showing the transaction date before the fork.
Tried every single server from the list.

Sorry, I'm a noob. 4 years here and almost no activity.
I will not do that again in the future.
By the way, I'm about to claim those BCH. Can I send them straight to the Split chain on Ledger or do I still have to send them to Main first?
Just want to be sure, would be stupid to lose them now :)

Did you use exodus? I found mine here:

Here you go.

All makes sense, thanks. Look at my solution below.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:11:31
yes, it was safe to send them straight into split (I decided I was sure enough to risk and not wait for the answer)
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:29:36
okay, my BCH was all safe here:

this is the other transaction, done after the two visible on the screenshot. That's what I had left after exchanging 0.03 BTC for Golem about the time my BCH "disappeared".
I don't recognise the BCH address at all, it has nothing to do with where I've sent any of my bitcoins to.
I was not missing my BTC, it's been sat in my wallet till about a week ago.
I've just noticed the BCH missing because I haven't used a BCH wallet before. I was away on holiday and didn't have access to my Exodus.

hmm thanks, but whose address could it be, and why did the transaction take place before the fork? I can't make any sense out of this.
