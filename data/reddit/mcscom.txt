What if you pay all of your wages in the form of bitcoin sent out from your branch in *insert island nation*?

Thanks for reading. Your comments are right on point for sure. 


I would say that in comparison to other currencies the supply is much more predictable in the short and long term, no?


Fair enough. I think maybe I should change it to "Cryptocurrencies *could* enable self-enforcing cryptocontracts"

Really interesting, thanks for the link. It seems no matter what way things go, Bitcoin likely has some role to play in this crisis.

Great to see that Canada is at least trying to be open to the Bitcoin technology.

Short story about a similar idea, for those who might be interested -

Don't get too excited though, our politicians are (almost) as controlled by moneyed interests up here too.

Encrypted cryptocontracts

There could be a means of providing this. For instance, a bitcoin wallet  could insure your bitcoin against theft and just send you new bitcoins if they get stolen. 
I do not think that there are any wallets that offer this service yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:12:39
I figured that something like that was happening. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:56:51
Is there no way to know where the bitcoin was transferred?
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:41:13
Or maybe, at what price would you sell the majority of your bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:23:25
What is stopping you from doing that right now with your bank account?
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:15:03
The problem was really more that the article was poorly written. After checking out your kickstarter everything seems to make a little more sense.
Good luck with the project, I think its a great idea
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:11:20
Wait, why do they need 70k for 3 months?

But you could have your money insured with your institute. Point being, crime is always possible. 
Is it easier to do with bitcoin? Maybe. Are there ways of minimizing the dangers of bitcoin crime, absolutely yes.

You libertarian types always seem so angry

To be fair, neither is overtly "evil", and it's kind of silly to suggest otherwise
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:16:50
But you could give your banking password to a friend and then after they transfer your money out you could claim it was hacked. Easy peasy
@_date: 2013-12-31 07:53:56
I'm not defending him either, to call either thing evil is pure hype and not productive

I for one have been inspired to get my security under control following a recent interest in bitcoin. I suddenly understand how vulnerable I would be if someone got access to all of my data.
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:38:03
It seems they are making a doc as well, so it makes a little more sense
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:07:14
If you are holding them in a wallet then they could tell if they have been transferred somewhere, no? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:55:55
That would still be fraud and you could still be sent to jail for it whether it occurs with bitcoin or not.

You are free to move away from the country and never talk to the US government again, but you don't really want the chaos of a stateless place do you?

Hot language about something that just might come to pass

I set up dropsync to synchronize keypass on my android and my PCs and I have to say it is pretty slick once you get it going. It ends up not being too hard to do it either. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:52:20
Perhaps then what I would want is a trustworthy bitcoin bank. I realize this might circumvent the purpose of bitcoin for some people but if an institution could actually take my bitcoin and hold it for me then it could issue other bitcoin if I wanted some for my wallet. This institution could offer services such as insurance. 
Does this exist? 
Apologies for the naivety

I want a place with balance.
