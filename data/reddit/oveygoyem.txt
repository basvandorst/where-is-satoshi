lol even with tethers it's going to keep going below 8

Haha this is like when the banks were telling each other not to sell while they secretly liquidated everything because they knew everything was going to flatline

Run while you still have a portfolio

And all you have to do is lock $5000 into the coffee shop and pay a $50 fee to do so, then you can enjoy all of the coffees with low transaction fees that you want as long as you only ever spend the money in that coffee shop.

Trends mean nothing in a pyramid scheme

Like tether except tether just prints hundreds of millions of dollars a day with no accountability

Because they wanted to exploit the huge profits and running an exchange has zero risk. They were too slow.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:43:57
Always too slow to make money

It did before but then $100m in tether was printed allowing them to buy up the supply and keep it from dropping further

I hope you aren't invested in this without knowing that 90% of the market is just one guy who wrote a billion dollars into his exchange out of nowhere and used it to buy the currency to get the price up to 20k and keep it from crashing too much.

Once their memecoins crash they will dump their entire stock on the market making them dirt cheap

Well if I go to a shop and want to buy a hat then it's not really practical for me to spend 
$200 in fees to open up a channel and then deposit $5000 in it so that I can buy hats whenever I want because I don't need to buy hats regularly.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:12:26
Uh oh the tether support broke and now it's going below 10 for good

The mistake you guys made was believing in market cap as if that is somehow an actual measurement for something that has no value and relies entirely on demand.
If even 1% of the "market cap" was sold then the price would flatline.

It is though, the entire design of the system where 5 people own most of it and everyone else gets it by buying off them makes it a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:51:37
This is known as the sunk cost fallacy
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:52:24
Yes put everything you have into it
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:25:54
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:08:07
That only works if the price doesn't permanently collapse, if your asset drops to 1% of its value and stays there then you have lost a lot of money.
