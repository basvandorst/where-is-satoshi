Roger Ver will come to the rescue with a steam-powered shitcoin?

If you're a bit thick, maybe just give up?

Ghosts, having no physical form, are attracted during the Halloween period to Bitcoin, which also has no physical form.
It is the only way for spirits to financially invest.
Try this experiment: Install a keylogger, then put a piece of cake on your keyboard on the 31st of October.
You will find that, overnight, your bank account has been emptied by a ghost buying Bitcoin.
You have been warned!

Purchase.  Hold.
Trading / day-trading is mostly for fools.
Just invest in ~~Batman's~~ the technology ~~which I stole from his batcave.~~

I'm worried about 100 dollars, because that's what I give Brie Larson and Ruby Rose as spending money in the town each quarter.

In many ways, it is quite good it is stuck in a range - it shows that there is resilience in Bitcoin's value.  And bear in mind that it now far out-values an ounce of gold by over a factor of 5.

So you want to make a fortune by trading crypto?
Bear in mind that so do millions of other people.
If it were easy, everyone would be rich - which of course is a contradiction.
Personally I would hodl your 2 BTC - compared with the vast majority of people, it is rather a large quantity of Bitcoin.  JMHO.
Got to go - Ruby and Brie are arguing about whether makeup is an instrument of the patriarchy - I wish they'd just get on with making dinner.
Cheerio Bitcoiner !

No such word as misserimae in any language BTW.
But SALVE BITCOINER!

Well, they might have travelled from the wrong past.

Difficult at my age, but I'll try.

Begins with M, ends with onero.
Severely underpriced IMO.
Here comes another ban :)
(Ruby and Brie also say goodbye.  They're back from alpaca feeding and are having a little superhero fight in the dining room.  There goes the cut glass!)

p.s.  I have no relation to bcashbtrash.  He is simply my inspiration.  Love Brie.

It's not how I talk.  And what you write isn't necessarily what you say.  Have you thought this through?
@_date: 2019-10-10 17:36:52
Heh :)
@_date: 2019-10-10 12:53:35
I'm not sure I'm happy with seeing that word on this forum.  Seriously. 
Why not edit it.

5.5 dollars per month?
You could set up a lemonade stall outside your house and do better :)

To some extent, though, the market has responded and recognised Bitcoin as the gold standard.  No-one takes the alts seriously; especially Bcash which has plummeted in value, and now struggles to be worth more than 2.6% the value of the coin it has repeatedly and dishonestly pretended to be.
There are people out there day trading alts, and good luck to them, but it is a dangerous game.
I have always invested in the technology and the distributed nature of coins.  That is the long term, sensible approach IMO.
Good luck Bitcoiner!
Brie and Ruby would no doubt send their love too, but they are out feeding my alpacas.  They love doing that.   (I'm more woke these days - no more dangerous animals for me.)
@_date: 2019-10-10 10:16:04
Brie would like to add that, despite me being a member of the patriarchy by the accident of birth of having a dick and balls, the person you allege me to be has always forcefully supported Bitcoin, and attempted to drag imposters like Dodger Ver through the mud.
I guess Brie is allowed to have an opinion.  BTW I can't find Ruby, I think she's upstairs tidying up or something.
@_date: 2019-10-13 15:36:55
Nonsense.  
If Bitcoin's cryptography is broken - ALL cryptography is broken.
Bitcoin will be the least of your worries.
Tired of this FUD.
@_date: 2019-10-12 08:31:07
Agreed.  There is clear and mounting evidence of price resilience in the old coin :)
My algos predict a significant and sustained price rise short to medium, so I'll be stocking up.
See you on Mare Tranquillitatis :)  Bring sandwiches and a cold beer.

ouch :)
@_date: 2019-10-11 18:56:22
I diversified, a little, into the only fully distributed and honest altcoin out there.  
My God it has let me down vs Bitcoin price-wise :(
I'll hold tho.  I like to stand by my fuck-ups :)
@_date: 2019-10-05 11:13:34
Only kidding mate :)  Good luck.
SALVE BITCOINER!
(Brie likes you too :)

Nocoiner with superiority complex - name checks out.

Is a noobie a noob?  And do you mean 'an' asset?
There's some serious noobying going on around here, and I suspect t is YOU SIR :)
@_date: 2019-10-05 11:46:05
But they live with me :)
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:09:29
Because people aren't patient.
@_date: 2019-10-10 11:03:53
I hate that term 'noob'
We are all noobs.  I was a noob when I stole Batman's gear.
Everyone is a noob at something.

Sideway strong, bullshit high.
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:34:14
Good for Bitcoin.

Day trading is the apprenticeship for future trollers on this board when they lose all their dollars.
Batwoman told me this.

Most of us don't need to self-censor, we try not to offend in the first instance.  As for being triggered - nope, politically I'm slightly to the right of Genghis Khan and over twice the age of a millenial, you pudding.
