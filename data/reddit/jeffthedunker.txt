I wouldn't be completely opposed to deferring my NYU acceptance for a year, but at the same time, if that doesn't get me into a position where I'd have sufficient scholarship and other aid to support me, it probably wouldn't be a likely option.

My primary noteworthiness with my Bitcoin involvement is writing. I'm not too active currently (stepped away from it throughout the whole application process), but I've worked with several different entities, including news sites and individuals. [Here's my portfolio on one of the sites I worked with.]( Outside of writing, I do a lot of different small stuff. I'm a hero member on BCT forums, so I've been pretty active there for a while. I like to look around for cool Bitcoin start ups and new altcoins to support. I do a lot of normal stuff like trading, buying things, and occassionally sports betting. That's pretty much it right now. I took an AP programming class this year, so I'm going to utilized my basic coding knowledge to attempt to code some Bitcoin application over the summer.
And I know Bitcoin scholarships wouldn't be the only way to go. I'm going to be looking into a lot of different areas, I just think Bitcoin might be a good start.
@_date: 2016-04-28 13:47:49
I don't think that's the case. Bitcoin isn't that cool in the eyes of the common man, and why should it be? Despite what we all may personally believe, Bitcoin appears as an extremely volatile investment and a weird internet money that can't do anything that can't already be done with credit cards and fiat to the common man. This isn't something that can be fixed over night, but rather, something that will take years, even decades to achieve. We are already on that path right now.

Let's say there are 1 billion BTC addresses that hold Bitcoin (actual number is probably closer to 200 mil), that means you're likely to look through (based on the previous number) 7,922,816,300,000,000,000. I don't know how many keys a feasible operation could scan in a second- I'll give what I think is a very generous guess: 1 billion keys/second. At that rate, it would take on average over 250 years to find one address that holds Bitcoin. Given that probably 97-99% of addresses hold less than .001 BTC, the time needed to find any meaningful amount would be far greater.
With these numbers, it doesn't seem feasible to use computing power towards this vs. mining Bitcoin or literally anything else.

There is a very reputable local trader in my area I found on localbitcoins.com. He is a licensed money transmitter so not one of those ppl u hear about getting raided for trading BTC. Whenever I want to sell I give him a text and arrange to meet up. He pays me cash I send the BTC to his trezor. He's usually got his shop set up in a pizza parlor that is crypto-friendly.
Like someone else mentioned, don't think it would be that difficult to go through Coinbase so long as you don't try to buy or sell when BTC is having a crazy day.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:17:15
Exactly. The first exposure I had to this was a pretty barebones set of criteria someone laid out on BCT forums about good shitcoins to buy on yobit. Put like $5 into 5 coins. Three of them died but one of them did a 10x and another did 35x. With some diligent research you can cut the risk of losing your AppleBee's 2 for $20 to a relatively slim %.

@_date: 2017-12-28 04:30:47
So, if there are 1 billion addresses that hold Bitcoin, it would take them almost 90 years on average to find an address? And 450 years at the much more accurate number of 200 million BTC addresses.
Someone earlier pointed out that the LBC is likely a scam anyways. They are losing a lot of money if there is no ulterior motive.

Bitcoin had no value before lazlo bought pizza. He gave it a real world value. People who sold and used their BTC all along the way have expanded the coin to a wider audience. And OTC trades or limit sells don't hurt the price. They are market makers who are selling. Price goes down when market takers sell (i.e. they go on an exchange and hit market sell vs placing a sell order above the current highest buy order)

I think part of the disconnect is that when I first started doing this, people weren't investing major amounts of money. I never invested *any* money, just participated on the forums in giveaways and signature campaigns, made some money doing freelance jobs, and made the bulk of it from trading. If I invested 1k and doubled it, for example, I wouldn't cash out and use the profit to go on a vacation. Of course, a lot of newer members are putting signficant portions of their net worth into crypto.

I don't, and the information wouldn't hold up today. It basically said to pick coins trading between 1k and 10k sats with a daily volume of at least .2 btc and no more than 1 btc.

Most of it is researching, the other part is trial and error and learning from my mistakes. I only buy coins I feel are undervalued in relation to their tech, where they stand against their competition, and with their target market. Part of my portfolio is long term, and I do not touch it rarely if ever. Part is more midterm, where I'll hold coins for a while and swing trade if they are moving sideways until they pump. Part of it is short term, where I flip coins that have been oversold or due for a big explosion. I'm not perfect and would have made a lot more if I didn't make some huge mistakes (heard of RaiBlocks? I passed on it this summer because its audio captcha was too difficult for me to interpret and I got frustrated and uninstalled the software, bought ChanCoin before it dipped 90%).

While I don't see inflation as the evil many on this sub regard it as, I still think it is important to point out that this argument is not necessarily true. Since the graph states USD is worth just 1/20 of the base year, any recent changes will appear very small on the graph. Despite this, the decrease from $1 to 50 cents was as big a change as 10 to 5 cents. The slope may be getting lower but inflation is in regards to recent years.

The world's supply of gold is worth over 75x that of Bitcoin, yet gold's total cost of production is only 25x that of Bitcoin. So gold energy/unit of value is 3x more efficient than Bitcoin.
And if we look at the raw energy consumed, gold only uses like 3x the amount of BTC to make it exponentially more efficient.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:23:00
While this is true, a lot of the long term holders were still pretty far off from the mark. The general sentiment several years ago was that if Bitcoin ever appreciates to what it is now, it means USD is failing and the global economy is collapsing.
There is a pretty popular post on Bitcointalk from some years ago that says exactly this- if Bitcoin ever trades for $10,000 it must mean USD is now worthless.
Obviously, this isn't the case, Bitcoin has appreciated to such a value without a real world doomsday. A lot of the early holders are lucky because they severely underestimated the price of Bitcoin in a disaster setting.

What are you talking about? Two years ago this kind of post absolutely would have been criticized. Probably even harsher than today. Bear markets cause a lot of introspection, and by 2016 the collective community had become self aware that the outside world's perception of crypto enthusiasts was piss poor and there were many a discussion about how to civilly and respectfully engage in dialogue with BTC agnostics and skeptics and what are/aren't good arguments to share in trying to convince people that Bitcoin is for more than just anarchistics and cypherpunks to stick it to the government and anons buying drugs and hitmen on the dark web.
You abolutely would have been criticized and I'd be apalled if I saw this on the front page two years ago. I'd probably write a similar comment to the one you responded to and similarly gotten voted to the top of the thread.

I used to do this on Yobit, buy coins at 1 sat that were at least sometimes trading up to 2 sats and wait for the 2 sat order to hit. This worked great until they opened Doge markets. Now the 1 sat coin is only worth fractions of a sat. and I'll never be able to sell it for nearly as much as I paid.

Consumer spending is a determinant of GDP. The more consumption that takes place, the higher the GDP goes. In edition, the higher the average rate of consumption, the larger the effect. (10 dollars of income with an average consumption rate of 50% is better than 20 dollars at 25%, since the merchant will also spend 50% of what they earn, so on and so forth).
You do bring up solid points on blocksize and mass consumption. The current system does not support mass consumption. However, the current price level does not either. The price increases have been largely due to speculators measures, which hodling could be seen as a variable of. However, if a person does sell their coins (and every investor does have an intention to sell at some point, that's the point of investing) they completely negate the effect they made when they first purchased their coins. You are right that not every saver has sold out, but each does have a price tag to sell at. Now, those who choose to exchange their Bitcoin for goods and services at the right time (what I assume you are implying when you mention not al savers plan to sell) are not grouped into the same category, as they do plan to contribute via consumption.
Consumption is the only way to create use cases for Bitcoin, because merchants and businesses cannot operate without customers. Sure, Bitcoin may retain speculators value for some period of time, but if it becomes clear that there are no actual uses (which will be the case in an extreme setting where nobody consumes) then price will eventually drop to 0. Conversely, if more people use their Bitcoin, more use cases will appear, leading to increased adoption and overall usage, which will organically increase the price.
Sure, individuals will act out of self interest, but their self interests can have a positive (or negative) impact on larger entities. Money supports businesses. The more Bitcoin you send to Bitcoin merchants, the more that niche will grow. Saying you an individual can't help an economy uses the same logic as saying an individual can't effect the price. If you whole heartedly believe consumer spending plays no role in the larger Bitcoin economy, you should also believe that no Bitcoin user has any effect on the price of Bitcoin. Obviously, that's not the case.

That's exactly my point. Hodling doesn't help the economy because the deflation it causes is artificial. Once someone sells their Bitcoin, they negate the changes they made to the price when they first bought. Since nobody is going to hodl indefinitely (it's an investment, they'll cash out at some point), they don't contribute. If you want to help Bitcoin by actually reducing circulation, burn coins.
Now, there is nothing wrong with Hodling, but I do have a problem with people who hodl under the guise that they are "helping the system" when they are, in fact, doing no such thing. Helping Bitcoin on a consumer level would be doing just that, consuming. Spending your Bitcoin in support of Bitcoin businesses and merchants contributes to Bitcoin. Hell, if you want to take it a step further, do some freelance work in Bitcoin and spend the fruits of your labor to support the businesses.
The point is, hodling serves a purpose of artificially and temporarily effect the price, but since all hodlers are inevitably waiting for the right point to cash out, the 'benefit' is nothing more than that shift in the price. 
For the economy to actually grow, consumption is needed. The extremely low propensity to consume among Bitcoin users is one of the major inhibitors of growth. This isn't a problem solely found in the Bitcoin ecosystem. If you don't think this concept is a real thing, look at Japan's economy. Their economy has endured decades of little growth and stagnation due to the saving mindset that dominates the culture. The people are not consuming a large enough percentage of their income for Japan's GDP to grow on the same pace as the rest of the world.

Bitcoin is no where near ready to take on a closed economy. We lack the community or infrastructure for anything of that nature to be successful. While you may still be sending fiat to merchants, the card still offers a lot of utility for Bitcoin to be used, which will help bring more people into the community and make more sellers willing to accept Bitcoin.

As someone who isn't too invested in the blocksize debate, all I have seen thus far is centralization. A handful of core devs and Chinese miners will be wholly responsible for whatever decision ultimately takes form, and a select few community administrators have immense power to influence what decision wins. That is not decentralization, large blocks or not.

That's a good philosophy to have. If more people exchanged their Bitcoins for goods and services (even if only when price is high) rather than for a local currency, we would see more use cases for Bitcoin, a wider variety of sellers and businesses, and organic fluctuations in price (as opposed to the speculatIves ups and downs that account for a vast majority of major price changes).
@_date: 2015-12-27 06:34:28
It makes the price go up so long as no current hodlers sell in response to another's accumulation (which, of course, they do, or the price would be increase infinitely). If you want to make a donation to all current Bitcoin users, purchase coins and burn them. Hodling isn't a bad practice, but it's also not beneficial. It plays a neutral role (at least in my opinion) and those who 'accumulate and hodl' shouldn't be praised for contributing to Bitcoin, when they are doing no such thing. If you want to contribute to Bitcoin through a similar strategy, use a 'spend and replenish' method to help Bitcoin businesses, merchants, and industries, which in turn will organically push the price upwards.
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:59:26

I'm taking a course right now called Marxist Economics and for my final paper I wrote about blockchain technology as a disruptor to the capitalist mode of production. There are a lot of socialist/Marxist thinkers who see the role of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations as a method of production that is radically empowering for workers/participants. This can also be argued through a neoclassical point of view which is algorithms as a means of organizing capital and labor has 0 marginal costs, thus displacing the role of the manager/investor/CEO. 
This does go beyond Bitcoin, as the DAO isn't (yet) completely possible with Bitcoin due to the necessity of smart contracts as a way to organize data and participation. If you Google scholar "socialism and Bitcoin" or something like that you can find a few interesting scholarly articles. Here is one to check out:

My point was for people with weaker currencies, storing their wealth as USD does the job. For us citizens, wages are readjusted for inflation rates in most cases. There are very secure (much more than bitcoin) investing options to ensure that your USD grows over time. It's really not on the brink of collapse, and if the USD were to implode, the world would have much larger problems than which currency to adopt. Even if it were to happen, they still wouldn't choose Bitcoin. The system couldn't handle a fraction of a percent of the world switching to Bitcoin, and it won't be able to for many years.

When you look at the overall value of Bitcoin, you take the price of Bitcoins x how many are in existence. (15million* 455 per coin about right now, or just under 7billion USD). However, if 10 million of these coins are controlled by people with no intentions to use or sell their coins for any reason, the real total value would be just 5million *455.

Bitcoin is already appreciating. Stores want sales. Nobody is going to go through the effort of accepting Bitcoin if they don't think they will get enough sales to be worth their time. It doesn't matter what hoarders can drive the value to, if they aren't spending what they accumulate it's worthless to the business. 
Furthermore, if people are concerned with their investment gaining value, they will be more likely to cash out, and less likely to spend. Anyone who purchases and then sells their Bitcoin without using it has 0 effect on the Bitcoin system. The price increases they cause is equal to the value of the currency they take out of circulation. When they sell the coins, they negate their initial upwards pressure.
If people don't spend, merchants won't adopt. There is no work around to this.

@_date: 2016-01-13 23:00:52
Ah, I thought you were implying you were in favor of the increase.
To be honest, I'm not heavily invested in the blocksize debate. I'm very pessimistic of Bitcoin's ability to "go big" before it loses the shitty reputation the batshit crazy radicals in the community have given it.
However, outside of MB size, the blocksize debate also concerns maintaining decentralization. Personally, I don't think allowing a select few individuals the power to dictate the direction of Bitcoin is good for decentralization, even if it means third world Bitcoiners can continue to run a full node. Furthermore, I don't see how relying on a single third party system (LN) is more decentralized than utilizing larger blocks.
Furthermore, relying on third parties down the road to simply use Bitcoin means the protocol isn't all that special. There are already businesses and other groups building their own systems and services on top of the Bitcoin network. The general consensus is these businesses are no harm, because "you can't have a blockchain without Bitcoin". While Lightning Network or another party isn't exactly the same, I think it would be proof that different softwares built in conjunction with the current protocol will work, and are potentially disruptive to development of Bitcoin as a whole.
Also, it's a relatively popular opinion that some significant event will propel Bitcoin to mainstream. If this is the case down the road, such an event would be spontaneous. At the current specifications, the network could not handle some significant event that sparks a great number of people to switch to Bitcoin. If this were the case, I'd argue that Bitcoin has ultimately failed.
Now, I've read many, many arguments on both sides of the debate. I'm just not convinced that keeping the current blocksize limit is good for Bitcoin in the sort and long term, and I haven't seen a single person explain exactly how keeping this blocksize will absolutely not be a hindrance to any type of growth in the future.

Bitcoin is a long ways from 32MB, and currently at about 1% of the tps you stated. I don't think anyone is arguing for a 32MB limit right now? 
I do agree that something needs to be done to keep mining/running full nodes from being too centralized, but I also know that the network can't fundamentally appreciate to that level of usage at the current blocksize.

The problem is a vast majority of Bitcoin owners do not use their coins, at all. If more users took this strategy, we would see extensive growth.
The problem with hodling is it increases price at the expense of the supply of coins. Theoretically, this is beneficial, if the increases in price prompt users to use their coins, but the reality is a majority do not.

To clarify: sending Bitcoin to merchants who instantly convert to fiat isn't very beneficial. I think encouraging business of merchants that accept and use Bitcoin grows the economy (similar to what you mean with niches) and I think the best way to do that is to actually use Bitcoins.
Also, I don't think price is necessarily an accurate measurement of the Bitcoin economy size (but still a good indicator nonetheless). A large variable of price fluctuation is hodling. Hodling increase price per coin at the expense of essentially taking coins out of circulation.

This owner, after doing a bit of googling, only uses these franchises as a side income. He is the CEO of a digital production company, and these paychecks he picks up off the backs of impoverished labor are practically passive income. I've never seen him come in to work at a Subway before.

Furthermore, coins that are 'hodled' and out of circulation don't actually contribute to the real market cap.

If all 15 million were being traded for any amount above 0, the market cap would be 15 million*current price.
What you're implying is price dropping to 0 because everyone wants to get rid of their coins. That's a phenomenon that takes place outside of the market cap discussion.
You can't include coins that are not being used because they have no footprint. They never change hands, and as such, do not provide any wealth or value (outside of the decreasing supply, which is accounted for in price). There is no market for these coins because there is no way to buy them. If someone were to buy these coins, then they are, by definition, not hodled, lost, or destroyed.
Don't get me wrong, it's necessary that a certain % of Bitcoins are being hoarded. It's just a side effect that it accounts for an artificially inflated market cap. Hodled coins are factored in through the resulting increase in price, counting the coins as well is counting them twice.

He's got some good ideas as to why he likes gold, but the reserve argument is a false one.
The only way the federal reserve would once again apply a gold standard would have to come as a result of a global banking collapse and complete dissolution of the US banking system.
If that were to become a reality, Bitcoin would skyrocket similarly with gold, but beyond that, we'd have much, much bigger problems on our hands.
Actually though, in such a situation, Bitcoin would still be the preferable investment. Both would appreciate significantly, but with the resulting collapse of the US dollar, liquidity and ease of transaction would give Bitcoin far superior intrinsic value.
He is correct about the safety and mining of gold though, which are two valid points that attribute to gold's inherent value.

USA offers one of the highest standards of living in the world, (currently) the strongest currency in the world, and is operating an economy at full employment. Anyone can have a house, a car, and start a business.
Loans are not a bad thing, they boost the economy with the start ups they fund.
Let's say you come up with a great idea for a new product, but you only have enough resources to produce 5 of it a year. Are you going to only make 5, wait until next year, and reinvest your earnings to make 10? Or are you going to take out a loan, buy a factory, and produce thousands of products per year? Without any loan, it will take 20 years to get to that factory. With a loan, you have a factory and the loan paid off in 3.

Google "money multiplier". The current system allows banks as a whole to loan out 10x the total deposits. It's the reason why virtually anyone can take out a loan for a house or a business at a reasonable rate. We fundamentally can't do this with Bitcoin, due to the nature of the currency.
This isn't a good thing, it's a bad thing. Loans would have astronomical interest rates, which would lead to a further divide between the rich and the poor (something Bitcoin is supposed to help), due to the poor being unable to receive any affordable funding.

Engineering != economics
Furthermore, the value of Bitcoin hasn't been increasing because "The USD is losing value". Fuck, the USD is gaining value. BTC is going up in price because it's speculated value is increasing at a rate (much) larger than that of the dollar.
[Here]( is a source with some good statistics. Current inflation rate of BTC per year is 4%. What that means is, for the value of each coin in USD to remain constant, the market cap must increase by 4% from start to finish of 2017, or you will actually lose money. Also noted is what this means per day- an increase of 1.33mil in Bitcoin investment every single day of the year.
Now, during the next having, the inflation rate will drop to under 2%, and overtime, this % will approach 0.
However, it will never be a negative number, nobody is going to start *losing* BTC just from holding it.
Now, that's not to say Bitcoin isn't a good investment to hop on board of nowadays, but "deflationary" isn't the magic word that makes it such. If a deflationary currency was the key to infinite wealth and success every country in the world would adopt a deflationary monetary policy.

What's beautiful about this is I remember a few years ago, people asked "Could I use a miner to heat my home?" And the consensus was overwhelmingly "No, you'd need so much mining power that it wouldn't be worth it anymore." Fast forward to now and people are actually able to do it.

Rather than replying to all of your comments individually, I'm going to keep the discussion here:
To start: I'm only working because my parents told me I have to get a job before I start college (I'm starting in september). The only jobs hiring are the absolute shit tier jobs, because of the fact that I'm leaving in a few months. I've had maybe 5 manager tell me they'd love to have me but can't justify it for just a couple of months.
Anyways, these subway franchises are located in a very nice area, where cost of living far exceeds national average. Regardless, the wages given rank very low in comparison to other franchises, far below median wages for subway employees across America. To give you an idea, the Fry''s marketplace across the street starts its bag boys at 9.50 an hour, more than everyone at these subways makes.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. I understand subway is an absolute shut job and I shouldn't be expecting anything more than the bare minimum. However, I have coworkers that have been working at subway for months, even years, and I feel bad for them, because I know they are working 50-60 hours a week just to make ends meet. And that's why I can see how plenty of Americans think the economy is rigged towards the few. This franchise owner got a check from his parents to purchase a subway when he was 18, automatically surpassing his workers who have years of experience at the minimum wage level.

It's a classic tragedy of the commons. If Bitcoin users spend more money on Bitcoin businesses who then spend those coins on other goods and services within the Bitcoin ecosystem, the velocity of Bitcoin goes up, and as a result, so does the value of the Bitcoin economy as a whole, which translates to an increase price tag.
With that being said, if just an individual adopts this mindset, they won't see the other end of increased spending, they'll simply spend their Bitcoin and run out eventually.

I don't think that logic adds up. It's deflationary in the sense that the rate of inflation is decreasing... but there is still an inflation. For prices to sustain, 12.5*current price needs to be invested into Bitcoin every time a block is mined for prices to sustain, in the long run.

One approach that not many mention, and one that I personally used, is to earn rather than invest. It's rather easy to earn money just from participating in the community over at bitcointalk.org, where you can earn money just for talking to others and learning about Bitcoin. From there, it's quite easy to get into freelancing if you have some sort of skill (I did a bit of freelance writing myself), trading, or selling some good or service.
I've accumulated between 4 and 5 BTC from doing a variety of things, mostly from writing, trading, and participating on the forums. This mostly took place when price was $200-600. Unfortunately many of those coins were spent or gambled away, but I still came out with a solid amount left and some nice things to go along with it (bought a PC early 2015 with it).

Don't help them. This happens *every* time price is surging. People around you that have always been skeptical suddenly want to buy in. If they're seriously interested they can do the research and figure it out themselves. If they will do that, they won't panic and understand they might lose money off the bat. 
If you baby them and do all the steps for them, and they lose money, they will try to get out, hate Bitcoin forever, and never come back.

If you approach Bitcoin as it's own economy/ecosystem then hodling is detrimental to the continued growth. The more times some portion of Bitcoin changes ownership, the more businesses and industries can sustain themselves and grow. Conversely, when Bitcoin doesn't change hands (or is hodl'd), stagnation and eventually decline is probable for Bitcoin businesses.
Not many people will ad.it this, however, because almost everyone is hodling a sizeable portion (if not all) of their Bitcoin savings

Man, I saw your situation yesterday, and I was actually one of the people who quoted one of your posts saying I didn't think you deserved your trust.
I recognize Quickseller, he is one of the people on default trust and seemingly the most active. If something so much as looks like a scam, it can potentially lead to a permanent negative trust by Quickseller.
I looked through your entire dispute, and looked into your background. You had been an active seller since longer than I have been around, and hadn't had a single dispute until you were subject to a fraudulent item that was sold to you (yes, OP was given negative trust while acting as a consumer).
I was baffled that although you received your negative trust, the same person let the fraudulent seller escape completely unscathed. It's unbelievable this entire ordeal led to your ban, and I'm really disappointed that the default trust users aren't held to any standards - they basically have free reign to destroy anyones credibility single handedly.

For me personally, it is. However there are people who work within the Bitcoin community full time.
Actually, Bitcoin is very attractive as a real wage for people living in third world countries. In some places, minimal wage equates to around $50 USD per month, but doing simple things in the community (like participating in signature campaigns on bitcointalk.org) actually provide an income greater than what they would normally be making.

Don't think of him like a shopkeeper, or a professional business. Trading on localbitcoins is more like posting advertisements on Craig's list. You indicate how much you are willing to buy/sell, at what rate, and how you are going to do the transaction. From what I understood, the person wasn't attempting to sell Bitcoins to the people directly, I think he just used 15k a year earnings as a selling point. As far as localbitcoins goes, you can't really scale or even create a business really. The site uses a trust system, so that even if he showed his coworkers exactly what he was doing, they would still have individual accounts, and with little trading history they wouldn't be able to sell at a premium, until they got more trades under their belt.
To put it simply, yes Bitcoin does require an internet connection. If you have no connection to the internet, for the most point, you can't send money. It's not like you lose your money, however, it's more like losing service on your cell phone. You can't call or anything, but you don't lose any of your contacts or files.
Right now, Bitcoin can't be used worldwide. There are many billions of people without proper internet access. However, with the speed of which internet is expanding, worldwide access may take place sometime in the next 20-30 years, which is when "mass adoption" could potentially take place. 
Although many people see Bitcoin as an investment, others don't. I personally have not invested in Bitcoin. I started with nothing in the community, and by working as a freelance writer within the community I was able to begin amassing considerable amounts of Bitcoin. As someone who is under 18, I wouldn't really be able to do freelance otherwise. With Bitcoin, anyone can send me my payment from anywhere in the world with only my Bitcoin address, which is similar to an email address.
As far as promoting it goes, this is actually a huge dilemma for Bitcoin. You can send any amount of money anywhere in the world, instantly, for just pennies. Every transaction that ever takes place is stored permanently and publicly on the blockchain. This is why NASDAQ is using Bitcoin- so that they can create tokens that represent stocks that can be traded anywhere for just pennies. They don't have to put money into making sure transactions are never lost or forged, because the blockchain does it for them. This is why Honduras is using the blockchain to maintain and transfer land titles. This is also why countless of hundreds of thousands of third world country citizens work within the Bitcoin community. Their standard of living is significantly lower than that in the first world, and by doing micro jobs for others within the community, many are able to earn a wage far above the minimal wage in the company. (For example, People can sign up with a company that pays them to post on Bitcointalk.org. The amount people earn for several dozen posts a week is three times the minimal wage in Venezuela.)
These features are fantastic, reveolutionary, and unheard of anywhere else. The problem is, the general public do not understand what all this means, or why it's important. And many of those who do, don't even care. Nobody is going to buy into Bitcoin because they can send money to China from USA without losing 10%+ in fees, unless they actually need to do that. (Businesses with international clients post here almost daily saying how much they have saved from fees by using Bitcoin).
The average Joe doesn't care about any of this. He doesn't care that you can store your wallet in your brain, and he doesn't care that Bitcoins could change the lives of billions. What he cares about is money, so unfortunately, the most successful salespitch for Bitcoin is promoting how you can make money from it.

@_date: 2015-07-30 03:25:17
Very good questions, allow me to dispell your fear.
First of all, yes, the more people that buy into Bitcoin, the more each unit is worth. This is not the new investors putting money into the pocket of the old. Rather, the price increases due to an increase in demand. In addition, the more people that spread Bitcoin, the more likely mainstream organizations look into it, since the currency also has very beneficial technologies behind it.
As for the profit, he doesn't earn anything for recruiting new people into Bitcoin. The 15k a year he boasts happens because he buys and sells Bitcoin with a premium. Localbitcoins is a site that connects buyers and sellers locally in person, as well as worldwide online. The person who you are replying to sells his Bitcoins at a slight premium (most likely in person), and buys back (once again most likely in person) at another premium. In other words, if he sells 1 Bitcoin, which is officially listed at $250, for example (not the actual price), he may charge $260. Then he offers to buy Bitcoin locally, and instead of $250 for 1 Bitcoin, he buys at a rate of $240, generating a profit of $20 worth of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a currency, however the technology that allows Bitcoin to take place is revolutionary, which makes some people see Bitcoin as an investment. They look at all the things Bitcoin has to offer (minimal fees, ability to send worldwide, immutable ledger, finite supply, etc.) and think that because Bitcoin has several major benefits over local currencies, such as USD, and realize that people are going to increasingly use it, which in turn will make the value rise. This concept does not only take place with Bitcoin. People all over the world use different currencies as an investment. In countries with weak local currencies, many, many people convert their savings to USD, because they feel the future value will be much more than that over their local currency.
Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme. People are eager to recruit others because if/when mass adoption takes place, the value of each coin will raise significantly. (There are only 21 million coins that will ever exist, if the entire world dealt in Bitcoin the price of each would be astronomical). Since there is no company or entity that runs Bitcoin, the only way it can be advertised is through the community, so everyone tries to do their part.

Boggles my mind that the overwhelming majority opinion is that hodling is the way to grow the economy.

You should Thinkmoreaboutit. Deflationary currencies are fundamentally *bad* for primary use on a societal scale. When your currency is expected to appreciate in value, you are punished for using it. You are punished for taking on loans and credit. You are punished if you can't set aside money to save and if you don't have much saved already. 
The result is the rich are rewarded and the poor are punished. Have you ever been to a developing country where bank loans are difficult or impossible to get? It's not pretty. Families are tied down to the same household for generations because they can't get a mortgage on a new one. They build onto their house one room at a time because they can't take out money to build an entire floor. A bad storm effectively destroys the family's lineage.
Amplify this kind of disparity on the order of magnitudes. If you think cryptocurrency is going to bridge the global economy, reduce inequality, dismantle governments and bankers, you should also recognize the way this happens is *not* through Bitcoin as the one world currency.

For context we are doing state standardized test this week. Well actually we already took those I'm good to graduate. They are making new tests and using my class as guinea pigs. The test isn't structured very well and we had a really weird schedule this week. It was last class on a Friday and the teacher was just putting up a video to relax. If it was important content we would have gotten a worksheet to use with it.

Hey guys replying to every comment is hard so I will just supply some extra info here:
So first of all I appreciate the condolences but this didn't actually bother me that much. I just thought you guys would enjoy it more than anything.
Also a lot of people are wondering about the background of my teacher. She started teaching after a successful marketing career (supposedly). Nobody has confirmed allegations but in her about me segment at the beginning of the year she said she sold gourmet baking products for restaurants and other industrial buyers. Supposedly she made six figures and sold the cookie dough that was used to create the first pazooki (giant cookie w/ melted ice cream on top its 10/10 if you haven't tried it.) Again nobody has confirmed this but supposedly she has a really  big house and made six figures consistently when she was a sales person. So yeah one of the wealthier teachers at the school definitely and passionate about teaching.
As for the class itself its a complete joke. It's an elective class (not a core class, you choose to take it) but I didn't choose to. I chose to take a computer science class but it filled up and I got put in marketing. The class is a piece of cake and most of the business concepts and vocab I was already familiar with through exposure to bitcoin businesses and other general knowledge. At the very least the class is an easy A, but I haven't learned nearly anything apart from miscellaneous business fun facts.
And the teacher didn't laugh because I was being disruptive. The video being played was a filler more than anything to give students something to do. The teacher came over to see why four of us were huddled around a laptop while she was walking around the class.

Interesting as it sounds, I can't help but be entirely skeptical. Will the efficiency and low fees of Bitcoin transactions outweigh the added time and effort required to purchase all their necessities with Bitcoin? How will the community react to price fluctuations? Will most farmers be able to afford their currency potentially dropping 10-20% in a single day?
Don't get me wrong, there is huge upside in this concept, but I think it's too risky at this point in time.

Hey, that guy isn't explaining his logic too well, but I think I understand what he is trying to say. In that original equation, where Supply x Velocity = Price x Goods/Services he is saying that supply and velocity are inversely proportional- that if velocity increases/decreases, supply must do the opposite to ensure that the equation remains true. However, price x goods/services isn't a constant, so in reality, if velocity increases, we will see an increase in price/goods, rather than a decrease in supply. Velocity increases, and supply remains constant, hence a lack of correlation.
I'm not sure if I agree with his line of thinking, but I think that's the gist of what he is saying.
@_date: 2015-04-07 04:28:50
My bitcoin introduction is so lame compared to most people. I saw bitcoin available as payment on some pay per download app. Asked my computer savvy friend what it was, he told me they were volatile and not a very good investment, about $5 per coin. (This was the start of 2013 so his number was way off). Several months later some guy was offering a referral link to a minecraft casino. I liked minecraft and gambling so I joined, found out it used bitcoin. Learned that bitcoin prices were almost 20x what my friend told me a while ago, thought it hit the moon, joined the craze.

Sorry. People are okay with exchanging their Bitcoins for certain fiat prices (which can be explained by how important a role the USD exchange rate plays in the every day Bitcoin community).
Anyways, I guess everything is up to interpretation, but my theory is that the Bitcoin community can be regarded with its own GDP. GDP increases with consumer spending, so I imagine that consumer spending will pressure the Bitcoin value upwards. Now, investment also increases GDP, so hodling isn't bad. However, the lower the propensity to consume (i.e. hodlers aren't spending and new coins are also being held), the lower effect each transaction has on increasing the GDP.
Now, I have absolutely no proof to back up this theory of mine, and for all I know, I could be completely wrong. However, it fundamentally makes sense to me. If it doesn't please explain why. Thanks 
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:46:34

Nice Ad Hominem... my age has nothing to do with my argument that a Bitcoin howto uploaded to a channel with millions of subscribers is infinitely more useful than one upload to a channel with just a few thousand.
To elaborate, the channel you linked previously wouldn't be very beneficial for a few reasons. A: relatively small views. B: caters to the niche that is already likely to know about bitcoin. C: already has an informative video on Bitcoin.
Now, a video that explains Bitcoins to millions, on the other hand (an audience larger than the entities you mentioned) is very useful, as it gives a lot of people who were previously unaware of, or currently confused about, a good rundown as to what Bitcoin really is. This means, if millions of people now understand Bitcoin, we can expect some new adopters. If you don't understand why that is beneficial, I can't really help you out. Bitcoin needs to expand its userbase to ultimately be successful in the end game, and I don't see how you could argue that a larger group of users is a bad thing.

Hi, I'm 17 years old, been using Bitcoin for a few years now. Initially, I used Bitcoin to gamble online (mostly poker). I participated in micro tasks and giveaways on Bitcointalk.org to get my first BTC. Eventually, I started working as a freelance writer for a few Bitcoin sites (although I haven't recently, college apps/scholarships is what my writing has gone towards). I also earn from signature campaigns on Bitcointalk.org. I've used my Bitcoin to buy a bunch of stuff online (Steam games and Netflix accounts mostly) as well as a PC from newegg.com. I recently put in an order for a hoverboard on purse.io, but some errors went through on the seller's end and that order got canceled. I may purchase one through newegg in the near future. Right now, I'm primarily using my Bitcoin to bet on NFL through nitrogensports.eu. I've used Bitcoin a little bit in different online games trading items with other players, but not on a significant scale.
Generally, I imagine Bitcoin would be appealing to 11-17 year olds for small online purchases. It's very easy to earn a few $ worth of Bitcoin, and there are many appealing online purchases to be made in the $1-$50 range (premium accounts and Steam games in my situation). Many teens don't have their own debt/credit cards, and for those of them who also have parents that aren't fond of frequent purchases on their cards, Bitcoin is a good solution to essentially buy whatever you want (if you are willing to put in the bit of work for it).
@_date: 2015-03-14 21:16:33

@_date: 2015-11-12 23:00:09
I think a balance is needed. One of the major problems right now is that Bitcoin business isn't really doing so hot, because nobody is willing to part with their precious coins. This is why no big businesses have really began accepting Bitcoin recently, and also why many who have accepted Bitcoin no longer will. I imagine if nobody were to spend their Bitcoin, it would be hard to use it in a practical setting. I suppose this may not be a big deal depending on your belief, but I personally believe a practical future for Bitcoin should be a goal, as practicality will also drive up the price as Bitcoin is exposed to more utilities and use cases.
@_date: 2015-11-24 02:29:53

Hey guys, I am a writer with the site in question and I would like to share my personal experience with the site. I know I'm a bit late to the thread so I hope you guys see this.
I would first like to say that all of my articles that I have personal written for the site are original. I have only recently joined, so I haven't written a huge amount yet, but I do have several articles on the site, all of which are my own work. These articles can be found [here](
I have worked with several similar sites in the past and out of those who I have worked with, btcfeed has been the most strict about quality. Some of my posts are not immediately published, and those ones are typically advertise across different outlets for me. If I am on when my articles are published, I do post them myself onto this subreddit and other relevant places on the internet.
BTCFeed provides quality content, as the moderators have noted. The submissions on reddit from are no different from any other article posted on this subreddit. Spamming, at least to me, implies constantly posting and reposting the content onto this place along with many others. Articles are only posted once onto and as the mod pointed out, duplicate submissions are removed. If posting an article from BTCFeed is considered spamming, then posting an article from forbes or anywhere else is also spamming.
I have written on other sites that have encouraged grabbing content from other websites and rewording to make it appear more attractive. When I first started at BTCFeed one of the first things I was instructed was to not do this.
There are definitely poor sites out there that should be banned from This site, however, is not one of them.

The thing with hodling is it pumps the value of Bitcoin by taking coins out of circulation. What this means is the real market cap (coins in circulation*price per coin) doesn't change. If 10 million coins are actively in use at a price of $100 each, that's the same real market cap as 5 million coins in use at a price of $200 each. Hodling drives up price by taking coins out of circulation, and when a smaller size is being traded, higher volatility occurs.
I don't think gold is a good analogy because it's value has already been established and its been respected as a store of wealth for millenia throughout much of the world. Gold has little volatility because we know exactly what it is worth.
@_date: 2015-10-17 15:58:13

@_date: 2016-05-07 20:10:49
Exactly. If we look at Bitcoin in terms of an Economy or market, the only way for it to *really* grow is by exchanging Bitcoin for goods and services. The more times it changes hands without being traded for another currency, the higher Bitcoin's market value is. Any price fluctuation caused by hodling or other speculative measures aren't organic representations of Bitcoin's actual value.

With Bovada, I'm able to gamble with my BTC without breaking into any rules or stepping into grey areas. I thought this would be a lengthy process, but my account was created, verified with ID, and credited my Bitcoin deposit in all of 40 minutes. I'm amazed at how efficient it was, and I highly recommend any poker players within the Bitcoin community to give it a shot. There is much more to do thanks to the huge playerbase, and competition is also much, much easier than what is found on Bitcoin sites. My experience thusfar has been great and I hope I can continue playing on Bovada with Bitcoin for a long time to come.

The problem with that little anecdote you just shared is that the above scenario doesn't happen.
The "hodlers" of Bitcoin fall into one of two categories.
Category A: They are an early adopter and have been holding their coins for years.
Category B: They bought in 2013 when the boom took place and have lost money on their investment.
The people in category A can continue to hodl if they want, but the success stories they can tell their friends and family are all the same sales pitch that gets told over and over again. Hell, anyone can say that bitcoin went up x percent over y time and everyone who got in at that point is a millionaire.
The people in category B can't share their success stories because they haven't been successful.
Now, sure, there are a very, very small minority of people who bought in just before the boom late 2013 that have stuck around, and a small minority have also bought in at low points and seen small profits.
However, this very small minority that could potentially recruit a few people shouldn't be a valid excuse for everyone in group A and B that are currently contributing nothing with their holdings. Economies grow with spending, not saving and speculation.
The only effect on Bitcoin these hodlers have, as you mentioned, is on the price of Bitcoin. However, the idea that higher price due to hodling = more stability is actually quite absurd. Since no economy or industry is growing or expanding due to the purchasing and holding of Bitcoins, it is clear that any changes in price that take place due to these hodlers is purely speculation. As any significant change in price due to speculation can be seen as artificial, the actual effect on volatility is quite the opposite.
Now, if you believe that the only future Bitcoin has is as a store of wealth, much like a digital gold and nothing more, than sure, continue to promote hodling. However, many of us envision a coin that has real world uses and applications in every day life, and for this to take place, people actually need to put their coins towards consumer spending.

Some of us want Bitcoin to ultimately change the world. This can't happen while the general public rejects it.

There isn't a single Bitcoin gambling out there that offers a quality that matches Bovada. The huge playerbase is certainly a plus that cannot be found anywhere exclusively in the realm of bitcoin

OH SHIT HE IS AN EXPERT EVERYONE FOLLOW HIS ADVICE

Personally not a butter, but I might be able to share some insight.
I've been a Bitcoin believer for quite some time now, and a some of my friends know this. To the outside world, Bitcoin is generally regarded as a cultist society for drug deals and other illegal transactions. This, of course, isn't the case, but it's how a large portion of the public views us.
Anyways, one friend in particular likes to keep up on Bitcoin, checking in on the sub pretty frequently to catch up on the juicy drama. He has no interest in investing or experimenting in Bitcoin, but we talk about it enough to where he understands pretty well the whole concept and the history.
Every few days, he messages me on skype with a link to this sub, or where something hilariously stupid/interesting takes place over here. Sometimes we make fun of the mods overstepping their boundaries and overcensoring the community. Other times he links me to a comment/post of someone obviously delusional whose post has earned him a moment of infamy on or elsewhere. Sometimes I tell him some of the absurd stuff has taken place lately.
Honestly, I really appreciate these conversations. Don't take me as anti-bitcoin, because I certainly believe in it as much as the next guy, but talking to someone who isn't invested from a more neutral standpoint is very entertaining as well as insightful. It's shown me that there actually is a bunch of circlejerk/delusional bs that gets thrown around on here and eaten up by the community and sent to the top. I didn't realize it at first, but it's pretty entertaining to look at the sub from this new point of view, and I imagine the nice people over at get the same entertainment value out of it as I do.

I get the point you are trying to make but the gold rush towards California was largely a failure for the miners. Most of the profits to be made were of those who offered goods and services to the miners and inflated prices, and not the gold itself.

No need to be hostile friend, I'm just trying to help.
I cannot speak for everyone on the site (I just work here, I don't run it), but I can personally say that I am in violation of no reddit rules. You can check my account if you don't believe me.
You are right, there are a lot of freshly made accounts used to post our articles. You need to realize, however, not 100% of these automatic submissions come from the site. I recently wrote an article that hit front page of I was confused, I didn't post it. I asked the editor if he did, and it wasn't him either. Something unaffiliated to the site posted it. The account was also new, which leads me to believe there are bots or people who look for content that hasn't been exposed to reddit yet, either within the bitcoin community or in general, and post it for Karma, which has a number of uses.
The other thing you need to note is that subreddit rules and guidelines supercede general reddit rules. You know this. Nearly all of the "spam" is directed towards If the moderators allow it (which they have as shown by your dialogue) then there is no problem.
If you feel BTCFeed is promoting unethical business practices, then you should promote them, rather than the entire community.

I saw the price start dropping from $330 and put in a purse order to buy a hoverboard. Aaaaaaand looks like I overpaid on this purchase :)

Card games are a huge thing in my family. I started playing card games when I was 4, played in my first family poker tourney when i was 6... played $20 buy in and got 3rd out of 9. I've always loved gambling on poker but I've only been able to at family gatherings which involve gambling, and many of the poker players are getting old/have died, so these occasions are less and less frequent. I'm still underaged, and I live in one of the more conservative US states, so I won't even be able to do much when I turn 18. Bitcoin has given me the freedom to recreationally gamble when I choose to and that alone is enough for me.

The only way hodling affects the exchange rate is when hodlers cash out, which is effectively not hodling. If you are implying hodling is good because it creates a perception about what the price should be, well, you don't need to hodl to do that.

Thanks for the bold assumption, but the people I am referring to are, in fact, real. (crazy to believe I know) Maybe it's the area I live in (which is fairly conservative) but people who do know what Bitcoin is don't particularly respond well.

I, too, have dreamed of being able to play wager matches of video games I play frequently. You are right that it's not that much, you won't be able to make a living off of it, but you really can make a healthy sum of bitcoin playing on here. Higher level mobs can drop up to 100 emeralds (.1mBTC) each, and players who deposit pay good amounts for other ingame items. I think you should at least give it a try.
Also, I don't know if you like league of legends, but if you do, you can bet btc against other players in league of legends matches on leetcoin.com

Bovada is bigger? It's biggest site in the US, and third biggest in the world.
@_date: 2015-10-21 00:38:18
It's the whole mindset of "the system is out to get us, everyone is against me. No third parties, everything is evil."
Don't get me wrong, there is nothing bad about being wary of your environment, but advocating these ideals has garnished our community a piss poor reputation practically everywhere.

Online poker and livec poker are essentially two different games. Most live players would agree that online just isn't the same.

Hey guys, just signed up at Bovada, and went to deposit $25 in BTC. Turns out in order to deposit Bitcoin (and I'm assuming fiat, too) you need to verify your account by uploading a government issued ID and proof of address. Not a huge deal, this is standard for casinos that offer compliance. Kind of a hassle that I'm not used to, either way, but the much larger and fuller online experience makes up for it.
EDIT: Verification approve, took about 40 minutes. Bitcoin deposit was granted instantly. Very speedy in the grand scheme of things.

From an employer's standpoint it's a very big red flag to what this guy did. He went against his superiors to support a personal motive. As a Bitcoin supporter huge props to him, but if I were an employer that wasn't adamantly pro-Bitcoin (which happens to be a majority of all employers) this isn't a promising stunt.

If you are looking to accumulate coins but have the income earning is always an option. If you have any particular skill that you can sell online (think writing, programming, artwork, etc.) you can accumulate BTC by sharing it. Check out or the services section of bitcointalk to get an idea of the work available.

Met a girl in college, been dating since the start of February. She's my first girlfriend, and I had no idea what girlfriends cost. I've had a great first four months with her, and I've taken her out to fancy restaurants and we've gone on weekend trips. Today, I sold a Bitcoin through localbitcoins and was able to completely recover my expenses plus a few hundred $. What a time to be alive.

The article does mention Bitcoin/blockchain in explanation of this statistic, but it also talks about a shift towards multiple applications for payment/lending/investing. If mobile, digital transactions replace the utility for cash, that would certainly be disruptive to banking and payments.
