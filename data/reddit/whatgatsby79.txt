when i read the OP message I too thought of Apple shares. I owned 3K shares at $30 pre-splits ,,, panicked and sold them a few days later, just as it was making its historic run. this remains a big regret. why? grew up on SF Peninsula close to AAPL HQ plus i went to college with one of the sons of key insider (Regis McKenna) and was an early fanboy of apple products: Mac, Mac SE/30, IIcx, IIci etc ,,, I was also a stock guy, buying and selling shares of high tech companies,,, to be honest I took my eye off the ball ,,, later i said there is bio way i'm chasing AAPL how can i buy it at $50 or $100 when I could have had it at $30 ... this debacle of mine stings, for sure, even to this day ... i last looked at AAPL products in year 2000 and they were junk and i was asleep when they brought out the G4 models which were a cut above the field... when AAPL announced they were bringing out a phone the market applauded again and the stock shot up and I said, so what? there is Palm and  others. I lacked the foresight to see that AAPL would own a huge chunk of the smart phone space and that the public would go bananas for those sleek phones and wait in long lines and that AAPL would become a status symbol and luxury good par excellence ,,, how is it possible that I grew up near AAPL, went to one of the premier high schools in Silicon Valley (Bellarmine) etc etc etc have AAPL products all over the house and have been a prolific speculator in tech stocks ,,, and yet never made a dime on AAPL? and have been exposed to Apple-Mania and the hagiographic regard for demiGod Steve Jobs? i don't have a good answer to this question
