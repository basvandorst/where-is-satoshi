The end story is that there's no cheap way around it. The only way to get a partial preimage in SHA256 is by brute forcing, ie mining. There's no statistical bias (there is in the nonces, but it's due to implementation not weakness), no shortcuts, no way of generating blocks ahead of time. SHA256 is a cryptographic hash, meaning that one small change catastrophically changes the output.
There's lots to learn in the Bitcoin world.

Passing it to a p2pool node is better than giving it to ghash.io or BTCguild, who own 2/3rds of the network between them. We also know that Ghash.io has been double spending against people making it arguably worse to join them.

The input space is vast. You would never be able to make a rainbow table. You're talking more data than there it atoms in the universe just to try. Go look how the block generation works in the wiki and maybe you'll understand.

Some builds have basic support for floating fees based on network averages. I'd expect to see it in the 0.9 release. Don't expect a massive drop though, the estimates it produces aren't that dissimilar to the ones we pay now.
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:44:42
Some clients do force the fees when they're really not needed, so it's not unexpected that the average is higher than you'd expect.

ASICminer flunked out on their second generation designs and skipped forward to the third. February sometime, 0.2W/GH. Should be something to look forward to.

**You do not understand what you are talking about.** 
The block contains the previous header (256 bit) and the timestamp, and the nonce, and a random coinbase, and any transactions you decide to include. For a "rainbow table" of this you would need to include values for at a minimum for every value of the previous 256bit hash, the time, the coinbase, the difficulty target and the nonce. It's just not happening. 
If you think this is possible, I suggest going back and getting a basic understanding of what is being hashed when mining. There's not enough storage space to store your lookup table, and not enough energy in the universe to create it. Even if you could you'd be spending far more time creating it that if you'd just given up and mined normally in the first place.

I actually called this one out on IRC multiple times. The IP address is a university rather than a VPN service, it's on the west coast of the US. 
    
    MrBlaine: Is anyone looking to buy a KnC Jupiter Miner? I'm being stationed overseas next month &amp; I just listed one up on eBay last night,  - but I would be willing to sell to someone on IRC for a quick sale and remove the eBay, saves me seller fees too.. hehe. Just shoot me a PM
    brisque: anybody would be extremely unwise to expect that this person is the ebay lister. 
    MrBlaine: well, it has my phone number in the ad, you are welcome to call it to verify ￼
    MrBlaine: just ask for MrBlaine from IRC, LOL
    brisque: MrBlaine: your IP address also doesn't match the ebay listing. 
    MrBlaine: brisque, it doesnt match?
    MrBlaine: 100% I posted the ad, lol, you can PM me on there if you wish
    nsh: MrBlaine, people here are cautious because there have been a lot of pretty aggressive scammers. don't take it personally ￼
    brisque: MrBlaine: your ebay listening says Pennsylvania, your IP address says a university in Los Angeles, that's all. 
    brisque: can you explain the location discrepancy? 
[Maybe take it up with the university. It's fairly obvious they're a student there.](

Litecoin is substantially weaker than bitcoin, even with a large pool controlling hashrate. Botnet could easily take Litecoin over at a moment's notice.

You need a full copy of the blockchain, which needs a fairly powerful computer and a lot of time if you don't. It's not something you can set up on a raspberry pi in a few minutes and get mining with.

Brand new account. Nice FUD.

Most universities keep logs of internet access for this reason. Give them a call and tell them what is going on, people from the channel can give more detailed logs too. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:38:37
That's pointless, the address the miner was "mining" at has never been used. Photoshop.
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:01:56
It's not really.

No, every transaction would take 80 bytes. 


If you want it done, write the code and submit a patch. Limited developers working on a difficult codebase that needs lots of testing and frankly kinda sucked to begin with. 


Trust is not reduced, read the paper.

It's quite involved, there's guides on bticointalk.

Mm on p2pool you might get a payout once every few months. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:49:16


That's pretty much it. 


Yes. The operators of public nodes can charge fees for that service but there's none if you're connected to your own node.

The vast majority people use raspberry pi or beaglebones for their miners.
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:23:43
That's strange. I was expecting links to malware or phishing sites. The SPF checks out so it was definitely not sent by anybody else. I can't work it out. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:01:06
No, but you might be waiting weeks for a payout if you mine slowly.

Have any plan to port the functionality into a webapp? Safari has absolutely everything you need now. Apple has long suggested this course for apps that are inappropriate for the store itself.

Connecting to somebody elses node like that is a proxy.

This website has some stats about how the network is doing. 
If you don't want to run your own node, you can mine at any of the public p2pool nodes by setting your address as your username. Pick the closest node to you with a fee that sounds sane. You won't get a payout for at least a day but hang tight. Variance is more than with a normal pool, but income is the same or higher. Set multiple nodes as failovers in cg/bfgminer just in case of downtime.
Join us. It's easy.

Could you post full, censored headers? Remove your email address and name, but include everything else. Top button on the right and "view original".

Shares are difficulty 1M rather than difficulty 1-10 like you might used to be seeing on other pools. They're worth a lot more, but take significantly longer to find.
