JIM REPLY:
Your best strategy is to export the private keys unencrypted and have a look at the file that is exported. It should have the format as described in the help here:
Then import them, say into blockchain.info one by one.
You'll appreciate there are hundreds of thousands of Multibit users so we canot offer personal support. Sorry.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:46:27
I hope he helps me, I need that money bad :(
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:37:35
No, I did not.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:44:33
i am in lobby now, name is starbucks.  feel free to say "**" to identify yourself lol
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:31:18
The person was not online, and instead of me trying to get an address for him and holding additional funds longer, as a businesss person, I decided to refund him the same way he paid me.  What he does with it, is his choice.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:39:45
At least it has not moved yet.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:08:00
Yea, I was resonding fast all night..... I was wondering why you said I didnt reply....
@_date: 2014-04-09 13:11:10
Yes, I have backups from before and after, and none contain the private keys when I export from them.
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:17:45
1. I have a ton of space available, 300+ GB free
2.  It is not on an encrypted container
3.  None that was found during routine scan
4. Yes, I tried them all.
5.  No issues have presented themselves to indicate any error with hard drive
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:30:47
It will not let me send any amount, I tried small, large, and everything in between
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:11:32
I will be moving, most likely to blockchain.info, as I have been totally turned off on personal wallets due to this experience.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:23:53
Win 7, AMD Dual Core E-450, 4GB DDR3 RAM
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:46:04
I hope all is ok.  It seems this is rare, but it is a possibility.  Crossing my fingers for you.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:36:18
Yes, that fake user posted HIS address when I was sleeping.  Thank you guys for downvoting him.  I hope this user didnt send him anything.  I posted my address in the OP, and also in a reply here and in a PM to  "fuckmybitchup"
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:56:52
This is correct.  I am getting another migraine dealing with this again.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:40:18
Ok, so I got the .001.
I tried to send back .001, and it stuck, like the rest of my btc did.  I think because It tried to sent your .001, then the miner fee, which is going to obviously come from the phantom btc I have that I cant access but can see :(
I am going to reset the blockchain again, and ry to send you .00099, is that ok?  
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:14:31
He replied to me, one time, in PM.  Then ignored me.  Here is our convo:
MY FIRST PM:
I have tried everything in my power to fix multibit, and I am at a loss.  Can I send you my multibit wallet, and see if you can access the .49xx btc in it?  Here is a description of whats going on:
I really need help, this was supposed to go for a loan repay and also a bill I need to pay.  Only offering this because you are the developer of multibit.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:52:43
Life changing money in my case.  230.00 isnt a ton to most.,...to us, it is.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:21:21
I have my private keys of every single address in my client, except the one that has my btc.  Multibit did not save it and will not export it for me.
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:45:58
Then I missed your message probably.  Resend?
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:21:32
No.  I do not.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:42:08
He is a hell of a charmer, isnt he?
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:58:46
yes, same issue.  tried it on girlfriends computer.  then on a friends too.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:15:48
I have sent them tons of info, and offered to send them my wallet as well, as once they get the wallet, they can load it and see exactly what I am saying.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:46:47
But it didnt save, is the prob.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:22:19
And I did it one at a time.  Went through the process 3 times....took like 2 hours each time.  I didnt miss it.  I know that much.
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:05:45
True, but you would think the dev would show an interest in a bug that could cost someone a ton of money potentially.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:55:16
I am not asking for a hand me out, I am going to send back if it lets me, if not I will send the equivalent btc in seals chips to you.  So please do not think I am trying to get something for nothing, I will even send the chip first if needed.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:55:58
I do not know how to accept that, not sure if serious.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:17:16
This is EXACTLY what happened to me here....so I am not the only person.....
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:24:37
Seems like it.  Or maybe he just doesnt have any social grace.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:12:00
Hindsight is 20/20.  I should have.  Thanks for the idea.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:20:39
I am thinking I will take you up on this, since the dev basically told me to f*ck off, he does not want to look at this.  I will be home tonight from work, and will compile the info.  Please message me.
@_date: 2014-04-08 05:25:27
He created the program and puts out the bug fixes, updates.... 
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:23:19
I will most likely send the wallet to a few poeple who have pretty good rep, then if they are not able to fix, I will dump the info here.  I am so sick about this....but at this point, it seems gone to me.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:54:33
I did....
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:05:49
ok will try that in a moment.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:38:22
It is all I owned, and I neded to cash it out to fiat to help offset losses we are having since my wife is on maternity leave.  It is a HUGE sum for me.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:20:44
I know, right?
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:40:29
And they don't care to look.  Jim has said basically as much in his responses.  If it was his btc, you can bet your ass he would turn on more lights at his house and work on it.
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:00:52
Just chekced on changetip, it says:
WACOMalt You 9 minutes ago 54.925 mBTC
Tip Error
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:24:47
No, it is not. I sorted the address before the screenshot. That change address was like 100 addresses deep. So the whole its the first or second address always is false.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:54:48
Did not work. :(
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:31:45
checking now, will see what happens.  Thank you, what is your btc address to try to send it back to you? Same as you sent to me with ok?
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:45:34
It is.  It is literally 1/3 of my 2 weeks paycheck.  
Thanks for understanding what is not a lot to some may be a ton to others.
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:57:49
Yes, probably over a hundred times now.  I can see the btc when I am in Multibit.  It just won't let me send, because when I go to send, multibit does not have the private key, so it will not push the transactions out to peers.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:39:25
Somewhere, that private key exists.  It isnt on my computer though.  So where is it?  SOOOOOOO mad.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:44:20
He has ignored this from day one.  It is not his btc, therefore he does not care.
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:02:51
So awesome.  I just got it on my address.  If this gets resolved, I will be repaying you and anyone else.  Will be putting this towards the new baby.
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:37:01
none were encrypted.  I know that for sure
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:47:10
I am sticking to blockchain.info, when I get more bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:23:29
I went through the proper channels. He is still spewing saying i didn't....but I contacted him on github as he stated, and I did it 8 days ago.
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:08:22
My coins made it to multibit fine, and I was even able to spend them one time, with no issues.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:00:11
The only issue with this is everytime I try to import the .key into blockchain, it fails.  It asks me for a password, even when I export without a password. It says password may be incorrect.  Never had a password on my multibit wallet or the exported .key file.  So I have to import one at a time.  I can try that tomorrow, importing almost 600 keys one at a time is a long process.  I have done it 3 times.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:42:25
I just had a newborn.  Every penny counts.  My wife is on maternity leave, and I dont make a ton, although I do work full time.  So yes, its a huge deal for me.  And like it was said, what if it was 2 million?
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:24:12
Pretty cowardly thing to do, in my opinion.  I guarantee if it was his btc or a friends, he would be all over this.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:41:14






@_date: 2014-04-08 01:46:40
I have even allowed some trusted people to import my wallet onto THEIR multibit, and it does the same to them...then see the balance, but cannot send it.  And it does not export that change address private key.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:48:56
not hacked, as the bitcoins are still in the same btc address, not moved.  And I see the pub address in my receiving addresses on multibit.  So yes, never associated a private key with the pub address, which is really odd, and really bad.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:07:22
I don't know where to ask for donations, and I don't want to get in any trouble for breaking rules.....  ideas?
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:26:30
That is my post on GitHub, yet he tells everyone I did not report it there.  Of course, he made one reply....pasting directly from help doc on his site.  I tell him I did all that, and this is not the same issue, and he goes dark for over a week.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:19:44
I just tried, they are not spendable, still
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:13:49
Thank you.  Not a good week for me.  We are scrambling to make up the funds.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:32:37
Thank you.  I am so upset.  I needed to repay my small loan, and was going to put 100.00 of this toward newborn stuff, we have a 2 week old addition to our family.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:32:16
My safe address is:  1sea1GxLeqJDvpe41Ad5iBjs2zQkJK4zy
The other person posted was not me....hope you did not send them anything.
I am going to message you my address also.  Thank you for the thoughts.
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:11:53
You would think, but they do not.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:36:45
Thank you to whoever sent me .01098, anything helps, will make it up to you somehow, someway.
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:53:51
Yes, like 20
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:48:21
I imported every single private key (550+) that multibit dumped.  Nothing.  Did it one at a time, three seperate times.  The change private key is not being dumped.
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:15:02
Since obviously after a week, Jim refuses to look at this.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:48:52
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:17:22
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:25:34
I had to do some errands, left seals for a few
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:13:31
I am missing one private key (have one less private key everytime I export keys, than I have in my receive addresses).  Of course, the missing private key is the only address that has btc in it.  It appears the private key for the 1Ad address is not saved.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:40:07
I will count them now.  
Not a shared wallet between 2 computers.  And did not import a paper wallet.  Did import a few vanity addresses I made from vanitygen, but they show up in the export file, and 1Ad was not one of them.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:30:12
Thank you.  Anything you need, PM me.  Or post here.  I will be home later today
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:38:23
I enetered every single private key that multibit dumped, and it does not dump the change addresses private key at all.  It dumps every address except that one.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:38:40
Sorry, replying to all these questions, and also being so frusterated, maybe I was not clear.  I apologize
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:49:23
I do not have any btc to send to it, this is all i have.  But yes, that is one of my multibit addresses, I do control it.
I got the multibit I am using directly off of multibits site
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:03:35
They are not helping, they told me to find someone else to do it.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:23:45
Yes, I can do that in the morning, have baby awake now, so hard to stay at computer for more than a few minutes....feeding time.
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:02:01
I already replied to another comment stating this same fact.  I am going to be contacting him once I get home from work tonight, I do not have access to my files when I am at work, they are at home.  I appreciate his help.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:17:35
FINAL RESPONSE I SENT TO DEV JIM:
I understand you have thousands of customers.  So personalized support is not easy to happen.
But this is a serious bug, my bitcoin is gone  now, and if you load the wallet file, you will see what happened!  It might be baciuse I have hundreds of address in multibit.  But I am telling you, I see the bitcoin and the address in mu client, but when I send, it never is seen by peers.  Then when I refresh blockchain, it totally disappears.  If I restart the client, it comes back, same thing happens.  I see my bitcoin are still in the same address, when I look it up on blockchain.info.
And when I export the priv keys, it does NOT export the priv key of the change address multibit created.  I hand enetered each addres (almost 600) one at a time, last night on blockchain.
This is all the bitcoin I had left.  This is a serious issue.
Please look into this.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:22:58
I opened a ticket, over a week ago:  
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:14:21
Thank you so much. I didnt know about this bot thing, I just connected it. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:56:24
false. It was recommended by someone here. I don't gamble...well, I can say I have gambled maybe 20.00 total on seals.  I chat there mostly, and conduct business.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:55:06
Too late, sent it back.  I appreciate you trying.  I owe you .0001 still, if it gets resolved some how, you will get that 100 fold.
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:08:12
Which would basically render this address with my btc in it unrecoverable, it seems?
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:12:02
I am somewhat computer literate, but doesnt armory use command line?  I am not versed well in command line programs.
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:16:21
Thank you for your kindness.  I have gotten more responses here in an hour, than I have from Jim and anyone else on GitHub and bitcointalk in a week.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:40:11
I would like to try a test, but have no btc.  Can someone send me .001 btc to another address in my multibit?  I will send it back if it somehow fixes the issue by kickstarting multibit.  If not, I can send you a sealswithclubs chip, as I have like 6 on there at the moment.
A random address in my multibit is:
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:47:33
It is not that, I have never used a paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:28:38
I have a newborn, so my focus was not all there.  I will email you tonight with the wallet and stuff.  Life is hectic at the moment, I apologize for forgetting, and I thank you for trying to help.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:13:25
A user suggested I ask for donations to cover my loss.  IF I am wrong for posting this, I apologize and will delete it.  I can accept donations to:  
Some people have already been kind.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you for considering.  I will pay it forward.  I also have a few Verismo Coffee Machines (They are the starbucks version of Keurigs), that I sell on the side for extra income.  I would be willing to donate/sell those to anyone to recoup some funds, if needed.  They are brand new.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:20:07
Thank you tons.  Appreciate it :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:04:05
Here is a pic of my multibit wallet just taken..... proving multibit made this change address, and it is in my multibit client.  Yet, it is not able to be sent, nor is it able to be exported and imported into another wallet/client.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:52:42
OK, then import the keys into a new multibit wallet?
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:14:12
Long nights.  I work full time, and have a second job.  Of course, he sleeps right until I go to bed, then instant awake....no sleep ever :(
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:00:51
A- I have backups, and if multibit NEVER saved the private key, which it did not on this address, all the backups in the world won't help
B- Not demanding instant support....just asking a dev to look at a major issue.  A canned response then being ignored is pretty sad, its been over a week.  It's not like its a minor issue...
C- How am I throwing a temper tantrum?  I stated the facts as clearly as I could.  A temper tantrum would be me cussing, yelling, and threatening, and spreading FUD on multibit.  I just want it looked at.
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:06:54
Again, thank you so much.  Beyond awesome, and unexpected.  
I can't believe all this happened though.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:46:19
I did this.  I tried it on 2 different computers.  Both times, the client showed the balance, but it was unspendable.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:09:28
This is OP.  I am awake for the day, and hope that this can get looked at.  
For those that asked for my safe bitcoin address, it is in the OP, and also it is here:
To the guy who made a reddit account similar to my name, and tried to scam the guy who offered to donate to me, you do realize that the funds I am trying to access are going towards our newborns supplies right.  I hope you get hit by a bus, you lowlife.
Thank you all for following and trying to help.  It means a lot.  And thank you to the few people who send some millibits, I will pay it forward when I am able to.
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:27:43
Where is the hidden private key file located generally?  
Win 7, was only running multibit and chrome when initially happened.  I have scoured the system, have not found anything
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:31:15
I did, no response.  Not sure if he was serious.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:57:51
Someone else tried to recreate and they were not able to.  I am scared to try to recreate it until its been looked at by a dev, as to mess it up worse.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:30:53
Thank you for your words.  While I do understand that he may be busy, this is a rather serious issue.  I was not rude in contacting him, I was very calm. The least he could do is look into this, and although he is not required to, a show of good faith and helping us get somewhat whole would be nice.  But I dont that will happen.  Looks like I am SOL.  I do hope people see this though, and know this can happen.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:00:06
I got a 2 mbtc tip earlier and it worked.  I did not get a PM from yours though, and I checked the changetip site, nothing.  Thank you though for the thought, really nice.
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:46:25
Yes, I will be contacting him this evening.  He will be the fourth person to look at my files at this point.  Hopefully, it is more fruitful than the first 3.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:05:08
Isn't that a totally condescending post?  I hold out hope that he is just socially inept, and that he does care and will help me.  But that is fading by the hour.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:08:19
As I said before, big is relative.  This is huge to me.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:09:50
Yes, I have tried sending the full amount, partial amounts, min amount, and all amounts in between.  It will not get broadcast at all by multibit, at all.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:20:40
Yes, it was more like importing 570ish address though, not 449.  And yes, all were empty.  It will not dump the priv key for the 1Ad address.
So yes, that is exactly correct.  Posted a pic of the multibit client as I see it right this second, btc staring me in the face, unusable.  :(
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:32:38
Very much so... :(
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:25:20
I did not set out to persuade people not to use multibit.  But after his lack of response, then him saying this when he DOES respond.....I do not blame you.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:35:31
I am emialing you the files now.  The .wallet and the .log.  The .log is really huge, So it is uploading through dropbox/yahoo as we speak.  I will send it as soon as uploaded.  
Please keep me up to date.
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:52:32
Here is the link I created on bitcointalk.org for help.  Can post response from Dev that I received in a PM there if wanted.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:22:48
Ahh, I thought you were referring to the large chunk.  I was sending that btc to sealswithclubs to refund someone some chips, because shipping for their items they bought from me was less than I charged them.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:09:14
I have hidden files opened, and was able to locate the normal multibit hidden files.  Everything there is what I would typically see.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:22:23
Thank you, I am looking into this for when I get more btc. May be awhile, I do not have the extra income, we live paycheck to paycheck, and formula is expensive for a newborn.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:16:09
MY RESPONSE:
I did that, I have almost 600 addressesw, I did them 1 by one, something is wrong.
All I ask is you to import the wallet into your end, and see if it works.  For some reason, multibit sent the change to an address is my multibit client, but the priv key for that address does not appear in the exported file.  Its really weird.  I see the address that has my btc in it in my receive address list though in the program.
Please help me.....
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:18:27
When did I send money to sealswithclubs?  I chat there with fellow players, and sell my starbucks items as a side business for extra income.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:41:20
If it was accessible at one time, it was for minutes, since I completed one send, then tried to do another send a few minutes later, and it didnt work.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:18:08
Funny you post this.  I DID message you on GitHub here:  
And I DID go through all the help steps on the multibit website, multiple times.
Please DO NOT try to be condescending.  I gave you a week, and messaged you many times asking for someone to look at a major bug.  You chose to ignore me.  As for you only having one light on, how does that relate?  You certainly have time to log into GitHub/reddit/bitcointalk.
Obviously it didnt solve my issue, and you being condescending isn't a great way to help.  I was not aggressive at all in stating the problem.  Not sure why you get all aggressive with me.  
Imagine if YOU lost all your funds (just because my funds only total ~230.00, I am poor).  Would you just accept being ignored, or try to explore all avenues to get your funds back?  It is NOT like I threatened you, or even threatened to smear your brand. (Multibit)

I only show one rolling backup, have not tried that one yet.  I guess I would import one at a time again with that one?
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:27:45
I have backups saved. Tons of them.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:54:23
When I sent anypart of the .4985, it is always seen by 0 peers, multibit will not even broadcast it.  I had the person here send me .001, and I was just able to send back .0009 to him, and it went through fine.  So my multibit works fine, except for the funds that are in the address that the change was sent to (the 1Ad address)
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:43:38
Same time, they were all generated 100 at a time, together.  Within minutes of each other.  The few vanity addresses that I imported (not the one with btc in it), were all imported before I generated any addresses.

This is starbucks, yes.  I am not LEW though, not sure who that is.  But yes, I am starbucks on SWC.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:30:47
its not in the backup....it is literally the only private key missing.
@_date: 2014-04-12 10:30:17
Sent my wallet files to mike Hearn, have not gotten s reply or a confirmation that hr git them....was over a day ago.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:10:14
It says sent, but it never actually sends, it is seen by 0 peers.  Then when I reset the blockchain, it reappears in my balance.  I have let it sit for days to make sure, its not my connection either, as I had someone send me a little btc to another multibit address earlier, and I was able to send that bit back to him, no issues
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:57:39
I am missing just that one address....  556 get exported, 557 addresses in my multibit
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:03:25
OK, trying now
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:58:58
Yes, the user who said he would sent me that, did, and I thanked him!
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:21:13
The DEV OF MULTIBIT needs to address this issue.  I am out almost .5 btc, and it is all I had.  This is ridiculous.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:50:32
Because I tried to send the full .001 back, but the miner fee dips into that unspendable .04985 that this topic is about (.011 sent after miner fee).  If I reset the blockchain, it should revert back, since when I try to send anypart of the btc I cants sent, multibit doesnt even broadcast it.
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:43:09
None of these solutions worked.  Thank you all for trying.  Feel free to watch my .4985 bitcoin sit in the address forever, never to be able to be used again.  They are stuck here:  
If the Dev Jim or anyone actually wants to help, we could use it and would appreciate it.  MY blockchain address that I can actually access is:
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:28:42
I do not control that address, that is a nitrogensports.eu controlled wallet, and the funds did not end up there.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:20:58
Read that about a week ago, did not help me at all.   Thank you though.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:31:59
Thank you, I hope you never have to go through this either.  So sick that I was about to cash some out to get some baby stuff :(
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:37:11
I might not have done pywallet right, it is kind of over my head.  Do you know how to use it well?
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:14:42
I would like for someone reputable to tke a look personally.  I can send the .wallet to someone, if they show me they are reputable (bitcointalk acct/ vouches/etc?).  Maybe if they import it, and see what happens, they can look into it also?
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:33:44
Yea.  I don't understand why it didnt ever give me the private key of the change address.  It was all I had, not much, but I owed on a small loan and was sending to pay it back.  So sick.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:48:10
Not from the 1Ad address.  I made a successful spend, that used the 1Ad as the change address.  Then I tried to make another send, and all this started.  The transaction is in the OP
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:18:38
Transaction ID:  e61476e59a1180f5f18c58ea99016173f0d078f0e005a727432feee9a2499644
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:59:39
Thank you for trying to help.  I hope so, sooner rather than later.  This is a life changing amount for me at this point, with new baby and us losing an income due to maternity leave.
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:15:34
He took over her snapchat account...
I messaged it....thinking it was bullshit....
He replied...and gave a kik address...  i told him if he was legit, prove it. 
He said hed sent 1btc...i gave an address...thinking yea right. 
He sent 1btc.
Is it him, i tend to think so. Who throws away 1btc?  
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:16:45
NEXT RESPONSE I SENT TO JIM:
There is some kind of bug going on.
I sent .024 btc, and multi sent all my btc.  It sent the .024 btc to the correct place, but it sent the rest to another address ( I guess a change address).  I see the address in my receive addresses in multibit, and when I open my wallet file, my btc balance is correct.  However, when I export my private keys, it exports almost 600 priv kets ( I have a lot of addresses) , but doe sNOT export the one for the change address.
Its .49 btc, its all I have.  I have searched the internet and tried everything all night.  Tried importing to blockchain one by one, and the address with my btc was not one of the 574ish private keys that exported.  Still I see the address in my receive list on multibit.  
Please look into this.  Its like its an address that only multibit has the private key to, and will not give me.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:38:09
It's ridiculous that he wont look into this.  I KNOW I didnt do anything wrong, my wallet is not corrupted, and its a Multibit issue.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:27:11
The private key WAS NEVER GENERATED!
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:38:58
Go trump
@_date: 2016-10-19 23:55:31
Doesnt help the person who paid a fee, then no block for 2 hours, and cant adjust their fee....
@_date: 2016-10-19 23:47:14
Please show me a block with 2k transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-20 03:12:55
I am very unhappy. Thank you dr phil
@_date: 2016-10-20 02:27:40
How about the 20 before those?
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:40:54
Which solves the problem that we have at this moment. Also, difficulty should be adjusted more often than every 2 weeks as well. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 23:26:43
There are 33k transactions backlogged. Average block has about 700 trasactions, and is full. Exoect the backlog not to be cleared for at least 8-10 hours, if we are lucky and if we start finding blicks faster than 10 minutes apart. 
Difficulty needs to be adjusted more often than every 2 weeks, and size needs to be increased, to help mitigate some of this. 
Size increase wint help speed, but will help clear backlogs when they happen.
@_date: 2016-10-20 01:27:12
There has literally been 1 block with over 1200 trans in the last 15.  Idiot
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:27:18
28k unconfirned transactions. Huge backlog. This is why the size limit needs increased. Instead if confirming in 10 minutes, its taking 3 hours. Itll take like 6 hours to clear the backlog, and thats only if we start getting blocks every 10 minutes now.
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:51:22
It doesnt prevent a backlog. But, it mist definitely helps clear the backlog twice as fast. When there is delayed blocktimes, you need a way to clear the backlog in order for bitcoin to be taken seriously.  We are now iver 30k in backed up transactions, with many using a hugher fee...and they are still backed up.  A bigger size would help clear this. 
How do you think 30k transactions will be cleared in a reasonable time at a 1mb cap? Know what you are talking about.
