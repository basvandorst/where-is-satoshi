I know this isn't such a valued post but guys you don't need to attack each other on this thread- outside the internet - the world is not all that bad. 1 month since I deleted my FB account and at first it was tough....but a month later I have realized what tormenting hell I was in.

You are literally telling me i need to constantly support other channels of content to share or you'll stalk me and use negative connotation.... You are forcibly threatening me while you shill for websites with ad revenue.

Well I trade the Bitcoin spreads on Nadex so I play the volatility without having to go short.

So you are a shill for Bitcoin and alt coins because you reply with a username all over Reddit with it to shill them? What is the difference between your name encouraging people on bitcoins and alt coins versus where I got my things from? If td emailed me newsletters with motivation, I'd share them....I don't understand why you are constantly trying to make everyone (judigng by your comments on your profile) your enemy? Why? What happened where you turned on the rest of the world and made yourself everyone out there has an alternative motive or is out to get you?

this is why the internet needs to be blown wide open and 4 tech companies should not rule what we see through the internet. This is crazy.

Also you know what I did even though you were a complete dick to me for really no reason? I cleaned up my Reddit by your advice and even read a few articles. Can you please explain to me why you hate me so much ?

I'm not sure what you mean by "marketing taglines" you mean hashtags???? And yes I shared the video because people typically source news from places they trade. I guess I'm not sure what you're angry at me for, I am assuming social is to communicate ideas or content source? If I'm doing it right, please give me some tips it's not like I'm a professional trader or marketer tagliner.

The platform currently has a pricing issue showing like tens of thousands profit/loss right now, but it's really max loss 890 max profit 1934. My break even would be if Bitcoin lands near 7300. 
The setup is either I trade this into the end of week above 7300 btc or lose $70-890 if it closes under 7300.

You again. 1. What is shilling 2. What is now wrong with this now? Is motivation now evil? Is it because I get these via newsletters from a platform I trade on? What am I doing that is bothering you or making me shill you on Reddit?

I remember when there was a gold vending machine out there - trading on the OTC markets.
