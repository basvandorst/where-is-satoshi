No problem, mixmaster all you want, Karpeles, you also will be mixmastered until you give up all the MtGox and your personal and any other private keys you know of.  Then if there are off-ramps, we will force you to identify these people as well and repeat recursively until transitive closure or your life's closure, your choice.

Karpeles has as much chance of winning an extension to his bankruptcy protection as a hanged man of his sentence being commuted to life imprisonment.  Karpeles has chosen to try to stonewall the courts as if they have not seen this kind of scam before from con men a lot smarter than him.  I predict the judges involved will take great offence to this affront to their intelligence and slam the book on Karepeles nether regions and consign his pathetic schemes to Neverland.

Does he not realize that his bizarre and inconsiderate behavior is being etched indelibly into the immutable archives of the Internet....especially ironically twisted by the fact that he is working with the Internet Archive.

I believe that the complicated part is over.  As documented in the email I sent,  Roman Shtylman has claimed he is
holding the check for Citicorp which will be sufficient to reimburse all the ex-customers of Bitfloor that had outstanding
USD balances at the time of Bitfloor's closing.  Also, from the postings of Reddit user AudenX, we know that
the Internet Credit Union is ready, willing and able to deposit said check in the account Roman has set up with them.
If you look at Roman's official Bitfloor updates (not the investigative research done unofficially by AudenX), you see
that although there are "updates', they provide virtually no information since the posting of the reception of the check 
from Citicorp and that was over 2 months ago.  The AudenX information of ICU's readiness is over 3 weeks old
now and yet we see NO OFFICIAL UPDATE on bitfloor.com that the ICU is game to process the refunds.
This is a material omission  of fact and is patently fraudent as its only purpose could be to disadvantage Bitfloor
customers into not inquiring further as to why refunds are not proceeding even though the path is clear assuming that
Roman does indeed have ALL the money he needs to refund ALL cash customers.  What possible hang-up could there
be to publishing a refund schedule on Bitfloor.com and being purposely secretive and evasive other than Roman, in fact,
does NOT have all the money to make good on refunds.
I am open to other theories of why Roman might not be able to start refunds given no apparent impediments to doing so,
however, the party that is best informed and most compent to provide such theories is not talking and the only possible
reason for this dome of silence that I can see is that he is protecting the truth of his culpability (i.e. stonewalling to use
a phrase from the Watergate Period).

I do understand your frustration, all I was trying to explain was that as a not for profit we are staffed for a certain level and for a whole week we experienced a volume over 100 more than we do on daily basis.   So when the level became clear over the weekend I dipped into our limited budget and engaged a division of a Credit Union CUSO wrote the scripts and helped train them on how to represent us so we could further help.  All for clients that will for the most part close their free accounts after they get them.  Which is fine, really,  was just pointing out our break even point is not evident.
As to why you could not get through during business hours I am sorry.   There are two of us in the office those days and I am pretty sure we were on other members calls.    We are predicated on controlled growth.  Our main mission is to help the largely under/un-banked residents of New Brunswick.  Being closely aligned with our the Internet Archive on a philosophical basis we/I am also a strong believer in the bitcoin world and therefore wanted to help in what ever we could.
As a business we can not afford to staff for temporary situations as this - as I am sure you understand.   As a charity it is tough on us when the very people we are trying to help SEEM impatient with us.  I apologize if I misinterpreted anything in your letter, I had been working from 6am to close to 2am trying to help on the bitfloor situation.   We do need time to straighten all this out.

I appreciate your timely response and thank you for assuring me that the KYC calls will be
done within a week.
However,  as far as not treating your staff in a respectful manner, this is a complete misrepresentation
on your part.  I simply was treating your staff in a businesslike manner expecting that your organization
was being run as a business.  In contacting you or your staff, at no time did I use profane or insulting
language.  I simply let you know from a customer's viewpoint, what my legitimate concerns were and
asked for an explanation.
A business, let alone a bank, does not leave phone calls unanswered for days on its main branch number.
That is, if it expects to be respected as a well-run, tightly controlled entity entrusted with millions of 
dollars of customers' money.
I understand that your bank has somewhat the character of a charity run by volunteers on a non-profit
basis.  That is one aspect of your organization, if I understand correctly.   However,  you are advertising yourself
as a credit union to the entire segment of potential bank customers who most like know nothing of this nor should
they have to.
As regards to as "what business I was in"... I was a senior kernel support engineer with Sun Microsystems for
over 17 years and I have solved many very difficult critical time-sensitive technical problems for major corporations including
some of the largest banks in the world (ABNAmro, Citicorp, BOFA, Chase).  These companies, nor did Sun Microsystems
care that I was oftentimes  put *very* ill-at-ease by their urgent demands and I did not balk at my duty when in the breach as I had
made a commitment to the other party (Sun) when I signed my employment contract that I understood this was part of the
job and I willingly bonded myself to that duty for the compensation promised by Sun.

Dear Mr. Hopkinson:
I am not sure who said - "no good deed goes un-punished" but as my father always said it I like to think of him.  I am not sure what business you are in but imagine if you will a Credit Union branch, a brand new one at that, who one day finds a line of thousands of people outside it.  Now imagine that the Credit Union is doing nothing more than trying to help these people and is losing money on those like yourself who write to us and say: "Please explain or remedy this quickly."   
I am not sure what happened when you called as I was actually in the branch those days but most likely we were talking to other customers.   To lose even more money on trying to help you we actually engaged a firm to make some of the outbound calls so please be patient as they should be completed this week.
I understand that this has been an ordeal for you but we did not cause it - we are only trying to help so please treat my staff in a respectful manner.

Email to timothy.lee
Mr. Lee,
Thank you for drawing attention to the Bitfloor shenanigans in the previous Ars Technica story you did at the beginning of May. If I may be a bit presumptuous, I think you were probably motivated to do that story as a way of pressuring an equitable resolution that would result in Bitfloor customers having all their money returned as is just and also to help preserve the integrity of the BitCoin ecosystem at a time when it is most sensitive to the criticism of being a domain for scammers and fly-by-night artists.
Despite these laudable intentions, I am sad that I must inform you that your story apparently has had no measurable effect on the evasiveness and stonewalling of the person responsible for returning the money, the proprietor of Bitfloor, Roman Shtylman.
The sorry fact is that although Mr. Shtylman has acknowledged in his public updates on the bitfloor.com website that he has received the check from Citigroup Bank to reimburse all his customers, he has only remarked that he is working on a way to return the funds. This "working on it" status has been in a statis field for at least six weeks. Here is a cut-and-paste of the bitfloor.com home page taken just now:
QUOTE 2013.06.26
We are still working on the process by which funds will be returned and appreciate everyone's understanding as we work to return your funds.
The ETA for receiving the check is around 10 days. Until then, we will be unable to make any further payouts. We are exploring various options for returning your funds. ENDQUOTE
What Mr. Shtylman does NOT acknowledge and is even more telling is that the Internet Credit Union has given him a green light to use their services to process customer refunds. That he did not update this on the bitfloor.com home page is a material omission of fact and is thus fraudulent by its very omission. The basis of this information is from the Reddit user AudenX who has been acting as a liason between Roman Shtylman, his lawyer John Snyder, the executives at the Internet Credit Union and the ex-Bitfloor customers. Here are the relevant updates from AudenX:
URL:  .......deleted for brevity QUOTE Good news! 10-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 2 weeks ago Good news at last! I spoke today with Jordan Modell from Internet Credit Union. He was able to confirm that Roman has been in touch with ICU for a few weeks and has been working with them to set up a way to return USD funds to customers. Here are the key points: After conferring with their counsel, ICU confirmed that they can legally open an account for Bitfloor. They have done so. Bitfloor’s account with ICU is now open. ICU and Bitfloor are setting up ACH transfer capabilities for the account. Jordan should be able to confirm by Friday this week whether ACH into and ACH out of the account is set up and working. The main delay at this point is that ICU has to wait to hear back from their counsel whether they need to follow “Know Your Customer" guidelines for each of Bitfloor’s depositors. Jordan said it might take as long as until the end of next week (6/21) to hear back from their counsel on this issue.
And more recently and more downcast as the stonewalling of Bitfloor continues:
QUOTE 26-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 1 day ago Roman posted a very brief update on bitfloor.com today: We are still working on the process by which funds will be returned and appreciate everyone’s understanding as we work to return your funds. I do not have any additional information at this time from Roman or John Snyder, but I will continue prompting Bitfloor for public updates. I have been reading discussions on Twitter, and bitcointalk.org over the last week that indicate some individual Bitfloor users have recently taken legal actions against Roman and Bitfloor. I am going to reach out to those users to learn what they have done and try to find out how those actions might affect refunds. 21-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 6 days ago Just a quick note to let you know I don’t have any new information since my last conversation with Jordan Modell on Monday, 6/17. Next week I am going to turn my focus back to pressing John Snyder and Roman for a public update on the status of USD and BTC refunds. Based on what I know now, I believe that ICU is committed to providing the checking services Bitfloor would need to return funds and that Bitfloor should now have the ability to provide some information to customers about their plans for processing refunds. 17-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 1 week ago I spoke with Jordan Modell today. ICU’s lawyer has advised Jordan that ICU itself does not need to gather “Know Your Customer" (KYC) information about Bitfloor customers, but the lawyer said Bitfloor must collect that information from all customers in order to start processing USD refunds. So, at this time, all the legal questions on ICU’s end have been answered, as far as Jordan knows. The remaining tasks required to start processing refunds appear to be Bitfloor’s responsibility. Jordan does not know what procedures Bitfloor may be planning to use to satisfy KYC guidelines, so we will have to wait to hear that from Bitfloor. Roman called me shortly after I sent my previous update email (June 13). He asked me to be careful about making any statements that might mislead other Bitfloor customers regarding how refunds are going to be processed. I told him that I am doing my best to include in my updates only accurate information given to me by people I think are credible, and I invited him to please tell me if I ever include misleading or erroneous information in any update email. He did not say whether I have made any misleading statements to date, but I’ll be sure to include corrections in future updates if he or John Snyder provides any. Roman said they are making progress toward starting refunds, and he said the reason he has not been providing frequent updates while he works on setting up the refund process is that he cannot speak freely and therefore does not want to set any false expectations or provide misleading information. I urged Roman to start making more public updates, even if he doesn’t give complete details or a finalized action plan on refunds, because it’s a good business practice to maintain communication with customers in a time of crisis. Roman said he is hoping to make another update soon. 13-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 2 weeks ago I spoke with Jordan Modell again today. He hasn’t heard back from his lawyer yet regarding the “Know Your Customer" verification requirements, but he thinks he’s going to have that info tomorrow and asked me to call him back then. 1 Good news! 10-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 2 weeks ago Good news at last! ENDQUOTE
In addition to this omission of material fact of ICU's willingness to go ahead with the refunds for the last 2 weeks, Roman and Bitfloor has not been responding to customer inquiries, pleas or remonstrations and imprecations as can be easily seen by searching Twitter for "bitfloor".
What we DO find on Twitter, though, is Roman Shtylman studiously avoiding any mention of the subject of Bitfloor or Bitcoins while he goes hither and tither on extended vacations in the San Franscisco area:
(DELETED FOR BREVITY)
END QUOTE
During this entire time he has been touting that he has been "hard at work' returning our money.
I and other aggrieved ex-Bitfloor customers entreat you to investigate this further in the hopes that inquiry into the Truth will hasten justice in this matter. I and many others have substantial amounts held hostage by this Bitcoin Terrorist, Roman, and returning this money quickly is critical for many of us that were depending on it to pay essentials like rent and food for our kids...not to have fantasy-fulfillment trips as apparently Mr. Shtylman is doing and most likely with our money.

It doesn't really sound that Roman really have returning people's money
as a high priority otherwise he should have happened upon those resources you mentioned.  Maybe Roman thinks we are all millionaires to whom 10 or 20 thousand dollars is just weekend soiree money...If so,

Yes, exactly WHO is working on this matter if Roman is out vagabonding in the
Bohemian lifestyle he has chosen for himself??   Given his updates, I dare say
he is more of a "lie-down" guy...lying on other peoples' couches whilst perhaps
lying to his former customers??
@_date: 2013-06-24 23:27:28
My take away from all this is that Roman Shtylman belongs in prison where he cannot hurt any other innocent people with his scams.
He may or may not realize this, but I am sure a lot of people are depending on that money in order to luxuriate in the glow of such extravagances as food and shelter.  Having large amounts of critical money in limbo for so long is psychologically painful and has caused much anxiety.  Pain &amp; suffering and puniative damages are called for.

Don't project your own selfishness on everybody.  Not everybody is a schmuck like you.  It should be obvious from your own case that Roman is susceptible to pressure, like anyone.  It is an easy mental extension to use that same kind of pressure augmented in the way I have described to induce Roman to come clean earlier.  Maybe if he saw that the illicit road he was contemplating was not going to be so easy if you had tried to include others.  You are struggling in your own mental quicksand and the more you contort your arguments, the deeper you sink.

Enough of this nicey-nicey enabling of a most probable fraudster (Roman).
Everything about his behavior screams culpability.  Tomorrow I will
file a criminal complaint with the NY. Attorney General's office

For those people that down-voted my comment,  see how far "patience" has gotten you to this point.  There is no legitimate reason for Roman not to be updating us with his action plan as the ball is in his court since the Internet Credit Unit has agreed to cash his (alleged) check.  In short,
you are either idiots or Bitfloor shills and don't deserve to vote...just stifle yourself and take every sharp stick up the ass that life's predators care to send your way with that insipid vacuous smile you always soothe yourself with like a well-dipped jar of mental Vaseline.

I believe that the complicated part is over.  As documented in the email I sent,  Roman Shtylman has claimed he is
holding the check for Citicorp which will be sufficient to reimburse all the ex-customers of Bitfloor that had outstanding
USD balances at the time of Bitfloor's closing.  Also, from the postings of Reddit user AudenX, we know that
the Internet Credit Union is ready, willing and able to deposit said check in the account Roman has set up with them.
If you look at Roman's official Bitfloor updates (not the investigative research done unofficially by AudenX), you see
that although there are "updates', they provide virtually no information since the posting of the reception of the check 
from Citicorp and that was over 2 months ago.  The AudenX information of ICU's readiness is over 3 weeks old
now and yet we see NO OFFICIAL UPDATE on bitfloor.com that the ICU is game to process the refunds.
This is a material omission  of fact and is patently fraudent as its only purpose could be to disadvantage Bitfloor
customers into not inquiring further as to why refunds are not proceeding even though the path is clear assuming that
Roman does indeed have ALL the money he needs to refund ALL cash customers.  What possible hang-up could there
be to publishing a refund schedule on Bitfloor.com and being purposely secretive and evasive other than Roman, in fact,
does NOT have all the money to make good on refunds.
I am open to other theories of why Roman might not be able to start refunds given no apparent impediments to doing so,
however, the party that is best informed and most compent to provide such theories is not talking and the only possible
reason for this dome of silence that I can see is that he is protecting the truth of his culpability (i.e. stonewalling to use
a phrase from the Watergate Period).

Hi Carl - 
 Thanks for this. I'm sympathetic with your frustration. But it does appear from what you quote below that BitFloor has been communicating regular with its former customers. 
  Unless you think or can show something underhanded is going on, I'm not sure the fact that is taking more than a couple of months for the return of funds -- considering anything involving bitcoin and money is complicated -- is necessarily a story for us. But I'm open to looking into it if you known anything else outside of your last email.

Email to timothy.lee
Mr. Lee,
Thank you for drawing attention to the Bitfloor shenanigans in the previous Ars Technica story you did
at the beginning of May.  If I may be a bit presumptuous, I think you were probably motivated to do that
story as a way of pressuring an equitable resolution that would result in Bitfloor customers having all their
money returned as is just and also to help preserve the integrity of the BitCoin ecosystem at a time when
it is most sensitive to the criticism of being a domain for scammers and fly-by-night artists.
Despite these laudable intentions, I am sad that I must inform you that your story apparently has had no
measurable effect on the evasiveness and stonewalling of the person responsible for returning the money,
the proprietor of Bitfloor, Roman Shtylman.
The sorry fact is that although Mr. Shtylman has acknowledged in his public updates on the bitfloor.com
website that he has received the check from Citigroup Bank to reimburse all his customers, he has only
remarked that he is working on a way to return the funds.  This "working on it" status has been in a statis
field for at least six weeks. Here is a cut-and-paste of the bitfloor.com home page taken just now:
We are still working on the process by which funds will be returned and appreciate everyone's understanding as we work to return your funds.
The ETA for receiving the check is around 10 days. Until then, we will be unable to make any further payouts. We are exploring various options for returning your funds.
What Mr. Shtylman does NOT acknowledge and is even more telling is that the Internet Credit Union has given him a green light
to use their services to process customer refunds.  That he did not update this on the bitfloor.com home page is a material omission
of fact and is thus fraudulent by its very omission.  The basis of this information is from the Reddit user AudenX who has been
acting as a liason between Roman Shtylman, his lawyer John Snyder, the executives at the Internet Credit Union and the
ex-Bitfloor customers.  Here are the relevant updates from AudenX:

Good news! 10-June-2013 Bitfloor update
Posted 2 weeks ago
Good news at last!
I spoke today with Jordan Modell from Internet Credit Union. He was able to confirm that Roman has been in touch with ICU for a few weeks and has been working with them to set up a way to return USD funds to customers. Here are the key points:
After conferring with their counsel, ICU confirmed that they can legally open an account for Bitfloor. They have done so. Bitfloor’s account with ICU is now open.
ICU and Bitfloor are setting up ACH transfer capabilities for the account. Jordan should be able to confirm by Friday this week whether ACH into and ACH out of the account is set up and working.
The main delay at this point is that ICU has to wait to hear back from their counsel whether they need to follow “Know Your Customer" guidelines for each of Bitfloor’s depositors. Jordan said it might take as long as until the end of next week (6/21) to hear back from their counsel on this issue.
And more recently and more downcast as the stonewalling of Bitfloor continues:
26-June-2013 Bitfloor update
Posted 1 day ago
Roman posted a very brief update on bitfloor.com today:
We are still working on the process by which funds will be returned and appreciate everyone’s understanding as we work to return your funds.
I do not have any additional information at this time from Roman or John Snyder, but I will continue prompting Bitfloor for public updates.
I have been reading discussions on Twitter, and bitcointalk.org over the last week that indicate some individual Bitfloor users have recently taken legal actions against Roman and Bitfloor. I am going to reach out to those users to learn what they have done and try to find out how those actions might affect refunds.
21-June-2013 Bitfloor update
Posted 6 days ago
Just a quick note to let you know I don’t have any new information since my last conversation with Jordan Modell on Monday, 6/17.
Next week I am going to turn my focus back to pressing John Snyder and Roman for a public update on the status of USD and BTC refunds. Based on what I know now, I believe that ICU is committed to providing the checking services Bitfloor would need to return funds and that Bitfloor should now have the ability to provide some information to customers about their plans for processing refunds.
17-June-2013 Bitfloor update
Posted 1 week ago
I spoke with Jordan Modell today. ICU’s lawyer has advised Jordan that ICU itself does not need to gather “Know Your Customer" (KYC) information about Bitfloor customers, but the lawyer said Bitfloor must collect that information from all customers in order to start processing USD refunds.
So, at this time, all the legal questions on ICU’s end have been answered, as far as Jordan knows. The remaining tasks required to start processing refunds appear to be Bitfloor’s responsibility. Jordan does not know what procedures Bitfloor may be planning to use to satisfy KYC guidelines, so we will have to wait to hear that from Bitfloor.
Roman called me shortly after I sent my previous update email (June 13). He asked me to be careful about making any statements that might mislead other Bitfloor customers regarding how refunds are going to be processed. I told him that I am doing my best to include in my updates only accurate information given to me by people I think are credible, and I invited him to please tell me if I ever include misleading or erroneous information in any update email. He did not say whether I have made any misleading statements to date, but I’ll be sure to include corrections in future updates if he or John Snyder provides any.
Roman said they are making progress toward starting refunds, and he said the reason he has not been providing frequent updates while he works on setting up the refund process is that he cannot speak freely and therefore does not want to set any false expectations or provide misleading information.
I urged Roman to start making more public updates, even if he doesn’t give complete details or a finalized action plan on refunds, because it’s a good business practice to maintain communication with customers in a time of crisis.
Roman said he is hoping to make another update soon.
13-June-2013 Bitfloor update
Posted 2 weeks ago
I spoke with Jordan Modell again today. He hasn’t heard back from his lawyer yet regarding the “Know Your Customer" verification requirements, but he thinks he’s going to have that info tomorrow and asked me to call him back then.
Good news! 10-June-2013 Bitfloor update
Posted 2 weeks ago
Good news at last!
In addition to this omission of material fact of ICU's willingness to go ahead with the refunds for the last 2 weeks,
Roman and Bitfloor has not been responding to customer inquiries, pleas or remonstrations and imprecations as can be easily
seen by searching Twitter for "bitfloor".
What we DO find on Twitter, though, is Roman Shtylman studiously avoiding any mention of the subject of Bitfloor or Bitcoins
while he goes hither and tither on extended vacations in the San Franscisco area:
(DELETED FOR BREVITY)
 END QUOTE
During this entire time he has been touting that he has been "hard at work' returning our money.
I and other aggrieved ex-Bitfloor customers entreat you to investigate this further in the hopes that
inquiry into the Truth will hasten justice in this matter.  I and many others have substantial amounts
held hostage by this Bitcoin Terrorist, Roman, and returning this money quickly  is critical for many of us
that were depending on it to pay essentials like rent and food for our kids...not to have fantasy-fulfillment
trips  as apparently Mr. Shtylman is doing and most likely with our money.

No problem, Bitfloor owes me:
BEGIN Bitfloor.com account status:
time	type	status	amount
Thu, 18 Apr 2013 17:46:51 GMT	ach	pending	-14573.53 USD
END Bitfloor.com account status.
Yes, that is correct, Roman Shtylman owes me over $14 thousand USD.
I know of one person who is owed over $30K and another $25K.
In the Reddit group of users reporting to AudenX alone the tally is
over $780K.  And, I am sure there are many other people not bothering
or unaware of AudenX's survey.  It would not surprise me in the least if
the real figure is close to $2 million USD.
So, this might be all in a day's "work" for Roman, but it is a very impactful
amount of money for us muppets.
As far as not changing anything, don't be sure about that as Roman Shtylman is still
trying to maintain a "law-abiding" hireable cool NY Geek type veneer.  He is active
in the JavaScript and node.js communities and fairly well known.  So, it seems reasonable
that he might want to maintain this image as he derives social and technical approbation for it.
Despite the moral decline so evident in Western society in general, I still like to believe that
having  this shabby and very possibly illegal treatment of his Bitfloor customers exposed would cause
damage to that image severe enough in his calculus that he might decide coming clean is the
best course for himself.  Right now, I surmise that he is probably laboring with the tragically
delusional idea that everyone "will just forget about the money" and fade quietly into that goodnight.  I have assured Mr. Shtylman through numerous unacknowledged Tweets that
he is very, very mistaken and have exhorted him not to be a fool and take a black lacquer spray
paint can to the rest of his many, many days all for a few years of splurging on other peoples'
money.  Only a self-destructive,  short-sighted lunatic would make such a deal with the Devil.
Also, let me make this crystalline that I am entirely aware that in pursuing this I must stick
strictly to the facts of the case and not try to misrepresent my theories and opinions as facts.
My guiding star has always and will always be the Truth, fully exposed but unadorned with the artifice of deception no matter how alluring and my only demand is that I and
the Bitfloor community receive the same from Roman.

Another thing I would like to ask John Snyder is how sure he is not being paid with stolen property, namely, ex-Bitfloorer property.  Pleading ignorance on his part might not fly too well when he has a client who has to sleep on other people's couches and wears a Street-Wise vendor's hat
and to all appearances is indigent or nearly so. As a Harvard Law Grad,
in private practice in New York City, I am sure his rates are astronomical.
Unless, he decided to do pro bono work to help out a not-so-needy con man flush with 2 million dollars of stolen money. Not likely.

Subject: Bitfloor refunds....where are they???
Why no substantive update from bitfloor.com since the CitiCorp check was received approximately
2 months ago?  Also, why has not bitfloor.com updated its home page with the news as reported
by Reddit user AudenX that the Internet Credit Union is ready, willing and able to start the
ex-Bitfloorer refund process.  Could not this be considered a material omission of fact meant to
informationally disadvantage us Bitfloorers and cause us not to press for resolution since nothing
now seems to be impeding the refund process?  Your client's stonewalling is inarguable now and
further stalling is unacceptable and immoral.  There are many of us who urgently need this money
NOW to pay upcoming bills are be put into a state of irreversible financial harm as we miss rent and
car payments.

John H Snyder, Harvard Law Graduate, better be right about BitFloor having the necessary funds to make everyone whole, otherwise,
a good case could be made that he lied for his client in the Ars Technica email as he did not stipulate that Bitfloor was making that claim, so,
it could be reasonably inferred that it was John Snyder making that claim based on his own knowledge.

Roman's "soon" can be in geological time.  He better post a hard refund schedule within the next 7 calendar days, else the heat goes back on even more intense than before.  Please convey that to Roman from me if you manage to talk to him or his 30-pieces-of-silver lawyer.

Thanks for the tip Carl. I think this story might be too deep in the weeds for the Post, but I'll try to think of a good angle. I'd encourage you to also get in touch with Joe Mullin and/or Cyrus Farivar, who do Ars's policy and business reporting, respectively.

I have seen a lot of blogosphere talk of filing lawsuits, but I have never heard of a concrete instance of
anyone reporting of an ongoing lawsuit.  Maybe you can ask Roman's lawyer, John H. Snyder, Harvard
Law Grad in private practice in New York City.  But I have emailed him myself and he is equally
unforthcoming as Roman is.  
BTW, I wonder how a struggling programming like Roman who has to
sleep on other peoples' couches while in San Franscisco (for some unfathomable reason) can afford to
pay the sky-high lawyer rates that a Harvard Law grad in New York can command.  Might it be that
 Mr. Snyder is being paid with stolen property?  Non-inquiring minds *don't* want to know ;-)
Speaking of Mr. Snyder, you will recall from the Ars Technica piece that came out early May that he
is quoted as saying that Bitfloor has all the funds to refund customer accounts.  I hope he is right because
,if you will notice, in that statement he does not stipulate that Bitfloor is conveying that information to him and
so a straightforward-reading  of his statement is that he is speaking as one who knows this personally to be true.
If it is *not* true, Mr. Snyder could well be entangled in fraud charges himself, in my opinion.

Time to put some social network "shame and shunning" to bear on this
complete sociopathic asswipe, Roman Shtylman.  If he thinks he is just going to have a nice walk out of the park with our money, he has a big unpleasant surprise coming his way.  If he doesn't start walking the straight and narrow with the Lord soon, his name might as well be
spelled "Shit-little-man" because that is what everyone will think of him
when the Truth gets very widely disseminated.  It will be as bad for him as if he got inseminated in prison.  I invite everyone wronged so callously by this nimrod to partake in the festivities.

Nastygram to Jordan Modell @ IAFCU;Jordan,
I registered to set up a IAFCU account on Saturday but no one from IAFCU has called me
to verify under the Know Your Customer rules nor has anyone at the official IAFCU main
number picked up the phone and I have been calling several times during the stated official
business hours of 4pm-8pm for the last 2 days.  Apparently, this is widespread.
 A number of ex-Bitfloorers are getting quite concerned with this lack of responsiveness
especially given our horrific experience with Bitfloor.  Please explain or remedy this quickly.

If so, Roman's lawyer needs to be MUCH more communicative about what the
hang up is and give us at least bi-weekly status updates....not whenever they
get worried a rebellion might be fermenting from the stink that is Bitfloor...
@_date: 2013-06-25 04:25:25
Ok, then Mr. Insider, what is the hangup then?  Why cannot Roman even give us a current status report?  Is he under a gag order from the NSA??  More likely he is under a gag order from his lawyer trying to keep his derriere out of the prison pleasure pool for as long as possible...meanwhile, all of his former customers take it up the rectum.  My advice to Mr. Roman Shtylman is to rectify the wrong he has done post haste elsewise he will be looking at a lot more pain that he has inflicted.
@_date: 2013-07-06 23:46:34

Just don't let him sit there and get away with it with no pain....we must convince him that the money is not worth the pain that is coming his way if he insists on being a total sheissekopf...

I believe that the complicated part is over.  As documented in the email I sent,  Roman Shtylman has claimed he is
holding the check for Citicorp which will be sufficient to reimburse all the ex-customers of Bitfloor that had outstanding
USD balances at the time of Bitfloor's closing.  Also, from the postings of Reddit user AudenX, we know that
the Internet Credit Union is ready, willing and able to deposit said check in the account Roman has set up with them.
If you look at Roman's official Bitfloor updates (not the investigative research done unofficially by AudenX), you see
that although there are "updates', they provide virtually no information since the posting of the reception of the check 
from Citicorp and that was over 2 months ago.  The AudenX information of ICU's readiness is over 3 weeks old
now and yet we see NO OFFICIAL UPDATE on bitfloor.com that the ICU is game to process the refunds.
This is a material omission  of fact and is patently fraudent as its only purpose could be to disadvantage Bitfloor
customers into not inquiring further as to why refunds are not proceeding even though the path is clear assuming that
Roman does indeed have ALL the money he needs to refund ALL cash customers.  What possible hang-up could there
be to publishing a refund schedule on Bitfloor.com and being purposely secretive and evasive other than Roman, in fact,
does NOT have all the money to make good on refunds.
I am open to other theories of why Roman might not be able to start refunds given no apparent impediments to doing so,
however, the party that is best informed and most compent to provide such theories is not talking and the only possible
reason for this dome of silence that I can see is that he is protecting the truth of his culpability (i.e. stonewalling to use
a phrase from the Watergate Period).

No problem, Bitfloor owes me:
BEGIN Bitfloor.com account status:

Thu, 18 Apr 2013 17:46:51 GMT   ach     pending -14573.53 USD
END Bitfloor.com account status.
Yes, that is correct, Roman Shtylman owes me over $14 thousand USD.
I know of one person who is owed over $30K and another $25K.
In the Reddit group of users reporting to AudenX alone the tally is
over $780K.  And, I am sure there are many other people not bothering
or unaware of AudenX's survey.  It would not surprise me in the least if
the real figure is close to $2 million USD.
So, this might be all in a day's "work" for Roman, but it is a very impactful
amount of money for us muppets.
As far as not changing anything, don't be sure about that as Roman Shtylman is still
trying to maintain a "law-abiding" hireable cool NY Geek type veneer.  He is active
in the JavaScript and node.js communities and fairly well known.  So, it seems reasonable
that he might want to maintain this image as he derives social and technical approbation for it.
Despite the moral decline so evident in Western society in general, I still like to believe that
having  this shabby and very possibly illegal treatment of his Bitfloor customers exposed would cause
damage to that image severe enough in his calculus that he might decide coming clean is the
best course for himself.  Right now, I surmise that he is probably laboring with the tragically
delusional idea that everyone "will just forget about the money" and fade quietly into that
goodnight.  I have assured Mr. Shtylman through numerous unacknowledged Tweets that
he is very, very mistaken and have exhorted him not to be a fool and take a black lacquer spray
paint can to the rest of his many, many days all for a few years of splurging on other peoples'
money.  Only a self-destructive,  short-sighted lunatic would make such a deal with the Devil.
Also, let me make this crystalline that I am entirely aware that in pursuing this I must stick
strictly to the facts of the case and not try to misrepresent my theories and opinions as facts.
My guiding star has always and will always be the Truth, fully exposed but unadorned with the
artifice of deception no matter how alluring and my only demand is that I and
the Bitfloor community receive the same from Roman.

For those of you worrying about your money being returned now, I wouldn't because it is definitely sitting in IAFCU's coffers.  I learned this from the KYC lady who called me who apparently has the authority to freeze Bitfloors IAFCU account, which she did initially when Roman deposited 4 check totaling 2.8 million dollars over a month ago.  We were both mystified as to why Roman would not let this info out as it would have made him look like he was an honest person and not the slime-ball crook his whole secretive, non-responsive behavior suggested.

Mr. Lee,
Thank you for drawing attention to the Bitfloor shenanigans in the previous Ars Technica story you did at the beginning of May. If I may be a bit presumptuous, I think you were probably motivated to do that story as a way of pressuring an equitable resolution that would result in Bitfloor customers having all their money returned as is just and also to help preserve the integrity of the BitCoin ecosystem at a time when it is most sensitive to the criticism of being a domain for scammers and fly-by-night artists.
Despite these laudable intentions, I am sad that I must inform you that your story apparently has had no measurable effect on the evasiveness and stonewalling of the person responsible for returning the money, the proprietor of Bitfloor, Roman Shtylman.
The sorry fact is that although Mr. Shtylman has acknowledged in his public updates on the bitfloor.com website that he has received the check from Citigroup Bank to reimburse all his customers, he has only remarked that he is working on a way to return the funds. This "working on it" status has been in a statis field for at least six weeks. Here is a cut-and-paste of the bitfloor.com home page taken just now:
QUOTE 2013.06.26
We are still working on the process by which funds will be returned and appreciate everyone's understanding as we work to return your funds.

That he did not update this on the bitfloor.com home page is a material omission of fact and is thus fraudulent by its very omission. The basis of this information is from the Reddit user AudenX who has been acting as a liason between Roman Shtylman, his lawyer John Snyder, the executives at the Internet Credit Union and the ex-Bitfloor customers. Here are the relevant updates from AudenX:

Here are the key points: After conferring with their counsel, ICU confirmed that they can legally open an account for Bitfloor. They have done so. Bitfloor’s account with ICU is now open. ICU and Bitfloor are setting up ACH transfer capabilities for the account. Jordan should be able to confirm by Friday this week whether ACH into and ACH out of the account is set up and working. The main delay at this point is that ICU has to wait to hear back from their counsel whether they need to follow “Know Your Customer" guidelines for each of Bitfloor’s depositors. Jordan said it might take as long as until the end of next week (6/21) to hear back from their counsel on this issue.
And more recently and more downcast as the stonewalling of Bitfloor continues:

He asked me to be careful about making any statements that might mislead other Bitfloor customers regarding how refunds are going to be processed. I told him that I am doing my best to include in my updates only accurate information given to me by people I think are credible, and I invited him to please tell me if I ever include misleading or erroneous information in any update email. He did not say whether I have made any misleading statements to date, but I’ll be sure to include corrections in future updates if he or John Snyder provides any. Roman said they are making progress toward starting refunds, and he said the reason he has not been providing frequent updates while he works on setting up the refund process is that he cannot speak freely and therefore does not want to set any false expectations or provide misleading information. I urged Roman to start making more public updates, even if he doesn’t give complete details or a finalized action plan on refunds, because it’s a good business practice to maintain communication with customers in a time of crisis. Roman said he is hoping to make another update soon. 13-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 2 weeks ago I spoke with Jordan Modell again today. He hasn’t heard back from his lawyer yet regarding the “Know Your Customer" verification requirements, but he thinks he’s going to have that info tomorrow and asked me to call him back then. 1 Good news! 10-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 2 weeks ago Good news at last!

In addition to this omission of material fact of ICU's willingness to go ahead with the refunds for the last 2 weeks, Roman and Bitfloor has not been responding to customer inquiries, pleas or remonstrations and imprecations as can be easily seen by searching Twitter for "bitfloor".

In addition to this omission of material fact of ICU's willingness to go ahead with the refunds for the last 2 weeks, Roman and Bitfloor has not been responding to customer inquiries, pleas or remonstrations and imprecations as can be easily seen by searching Twitter for "bitfloor".
What we DO find on Twitter, though, is Roman Shtylman studiously avoiding any mention of the subject of Bitfloor or Bitcoins while he goes hither and tither on extended vacations in the San Franscisco area:

During this entire time he has been touting that he has been "hard at work' returning our money.
I and other aggrieved ex-Bitfloor customers entreat you to investigate this further in the hopes that inquiry into the Truth will hasten justice in this matter. I and many others have substantial amounts held hostage by this Bitcoin Terrorist, Roman, and returning this money quickly is critical for many of us that were depending on it to pay essentials like rent and food for our kids...not to have fantasy-fulfillment trips as apparently Mr. Shtylman is doing and most likely with our money.

Roman has the check (according to him). Roman has the Internet Credit Union ready, willing and able to start processing refunds from the proceeds of said check.
It has been the Russian's move for the last week and his flag is about to fall.
CheckMate, mate.

Mr. Lee,
Thank you for drawing attention to the Bitfloor shenanigans in the previous Ars Technica story you did at the beginning of May. If I may be a bit presumptuous, I think you were probably motivated to do that story as a way of pressuring an equitable resolution that would result in Bitfloor customers having all their money returned as is just and also to help preserve the integrity of the BitCoin ecosystem at a time when it is most sensitive to the criticism of being a domain for scammers and fly-by-night artists.
Despite these laudable intentions, I am sad that I must inform you that your story apparently has had no measurable effect on the evasiveness and stonewalling of the person responsible for returning the money, the proprietor of Bitfloor, Roman Shtylman.
The sorry fact is that although Mr. Shtylman has acknowledged in his public updates on the bitfloor.com website that he has received the check from Citigroup Bank to reimburse all his customers, he has only remarked that he is working on a way to return the funds. This "working on it" status has been in a statis field for at least six weeks. Here is a cut-and-paste of the bitfloor.com home page taken just now:
QUOTE 2013.06.26
We are still working on the process by which funds will be returned and appreciate everyone's understanding as we work to return your funds.
The ETA for receiving the check is around 10 days. Until then, we will be unable to make any further payouts. We are exploring various options for returning your funds. ENDQUOTE
What Mr. Shtylman does NOT acknowledge and is even more telling is that the Internet Credit Union has given him a green light to use their services to process customer refunds. That he did not update this on the bitfloor.com home page is a material omission of fact and is thus fraudulent by its very omission. The basis of this information is from the Reddit user AudenX who has been acting as a liason between Roman Shtylman, his lawyer John Snyder, the executives at the Internet Credit Union and the ex-Bitfloor customers. Here are the relevant updates from AudenX:
URL:  .......deleted for brevity QUOTE Good news! 10-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 2 weeks ago Good news at last! I spoke today with Jordan Modell from Internet Credit Union. He was able to confirm that Roman has been in touch with ICU for a few weeks and has been working with them to set up a way to return USD funds to customers. Here are the key points: After conferring with their counsel, ICU confirmed that they can legally open an account for Bitfloor. They have done so. Bitfloor’s account with ICU is now open. ICU and Bitfloor are setting up ACH transfer capabilities for the account. Jordan should be able to confirm by Friday this week whether ACH into and ACH out of the account is set up and working. The main delay at this point is that ICU has to wait to hear back from their counsel whether they need to follow “Know Your Customer" guidelines for each of Bitfloor’s depositors. Jordan said it might take as long as until the end of next week (6/21) to hear back from their counsel on this issue.
And more recently and more downcast as the stonewalling of Bitfloor continues:
QUOTE 26-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 1 day ago Roman posted a very brief update on bitfloor.com today: We are still working on the process by which funds will be returned and appreciate everyone’s understanding as we work to return your funds. I do not have any additional information at this time from Roman or John Snyder, but I will continue prompting Bitfloor for public updates. I have been reading discussions on Twitter, and bitcointalk.org over the last week that indicate some individual Bitfloor users have recently taken legal actions against Roman and Bitfloor. I am going to reach out to those users to learn what they have done and try to find out how those actions might affect refunds. 21-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 6 days ago Just a quick note to let you know I don’t have any new information since my last conversation with Jordan Modell on Monday, 6/17. Next week I am going to turn my focus back to pressing John Snyder and Roman for a public update on the status of USD and BTC refunds. Based on what I know now, I believe that ICU is committed to providing the checking services Bitfloor would need to return funds and that Bitfloor should now have the ability to provide some information to customers about their plans for processing refunds. 17-June-2013 Bitfloor update Posted 1 week ago I spoke with Jordan Modell today. ICU’s lawyer has advised Jordan that ICU itself does not need to gather “Know Your Customer" (KYC) information about Bitfloor customers, but the lawyer said Bitfloor must collect that information from all customers in order to start processing USD refunds. So, at this time, all the legal questions on ICU’s end have been answered, as far as Jordan knows. The remaining tasks required to start processing refunds appear to be Bitfloor’s responsibility. Jordan does not know what procedures Bitfloor may be planning to use to satisfy KYC guidelines, so we will have to wait to hear that from Bitfloor. Roman called me shortly after I sent my previous update email (June 13). He asked me to be careful about making any statements that might mislead other Bitfloor customers regarding how refunds are going to be processed. I told him that I am doing my best to include in my updates only accurate information given to me by people I think are credible, and I invited him to please tell me if I ever include misleading or erroneous information in any update email. He did not say whether I have made any misleading statements to date, but I’ll be sure to include corrections in future updates if he or John Snyder provides any. Roman said they are making progress toward starting refunds, and he said the reason he has not been providing frequent updates while he works on setting up the refund process is that he cannot speak freely and therefore does not want to set any false expectations or provide misleading information. I urged Roman to start making more public updates, even if he doesn’t give complete details or a finalized action plan on refunds, because it’s a good business practice to maintain communication with customers in a time of crisis.
