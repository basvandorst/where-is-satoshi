would you say that tax treatment for spinoff companies would apply to Bitcoin cash? I am aware of your blog but without clear instruction from the IRS on how the fork should be handled im confused as to what I should be doing. Ive spoke to my local tax professional however im left in shock at the amount I may have to potentially pay when I didnt receive USD income from the fork and would have to sell assets in order to cover the amount. 
Is it still in your professional opinion that the fork should be handled as income?

Bitcoin cash seems to be one that everyone knows but does this include every fork and airdrop?, Why does the IRS not come up with some type of guidance, this seems to be a big deal if people omit this

do you see the transaction on the blockchain? type the address into blockchain.info and see if the transaction is there
also ive never heard of simple bitcoin wallet. There are many reputable and vetted android friendly wallets why did you not use those?

This is if only all are using segwit ready addresses which could take a very long time when the issue is right here right now. 
We still have zero proof of how much this asic boost is actually helping miners. Not only that but we are talking of uasf and pow forks which would effectively destroy btcs network effect 
Satoshi by design made bitcoin so that we don't have to trust miners, what we trust is their greed to always want a higher bitcoin price. What amount of money would asic boost save by stalling progress compared to a 5x increase to bitcoin price. 
The narrative of how we can't trust miners is propoganda, we never had to trust them in the first place only their need to seek more profits
