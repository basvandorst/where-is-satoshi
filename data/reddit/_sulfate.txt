I just bought a whole coin. If half of us buy a whole coin then the rest only have to buy a quarter of a coin.

He was tricked? How?

This hurts bitcoin and never helps it spread. In 5 years I'll have bitcoin advertised on every rental property and every fleet car. Let them come. They'll never get my private keys out of me as even I won't know them nor the location of my cold storage devices. They'll also have to deal with my 3 service dog pitbulls who go everywhere with me and whatever body guards I have at the time. And if I die? Fuck it. They still won't get any of my coins

Looks like the last edit was him acknowledging the fruition of this prediction, along with a farewell message. Wtf?

We have been time traveling backwards for 2 decades now, although it's been with single particles like photons and electrons, it's theoretically possible to increase quantum entangled fields to send larger particles into the past as long as you have a quantum connection to connect to. You can also theoretically create your own gravitational bubble allowing you to dislodge from the time your currently in and move freely into it's future and past. Niel Degrass Tyson and other renowned physicist have lecture on these things all the time. It's not impossible, just currently to the tech we know about it is, and if their is tech that does make it possible today, we have not been told about it.

[The archive thread shows nothing,]( everything is gone in the archive thread. From the post to every comment, how is it back?
Also,[ if you look at the latest edit which is the edit you mention]( it is them acknowledging the happening of this prediction. But previous edits from months ago show the Epstein note already having been there...

How did you even find this?
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:27:29
Yup, this is why you never make your big moves on run ups. [I wait for the correction and buy those dips. Like today, I'll put in 10%, tomorrow another 10% so on and so forth. Dollar cost average style. ](

it appears coinbase is down. First time I've ever seen that happen. My friends order just got filled for 11,500 too. Which sucks because now it's back and away from his reach for a full coin like he had. This is why I don't trade and just hodl -_-

Then I ride the wave lol Take profits at the next ath, and sit on those profits till we hit another 80%, and insert it slowly into the market. hasn't failed me yet in in almost 9 years of this.
