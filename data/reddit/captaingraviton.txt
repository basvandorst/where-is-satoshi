Good to know. I knew he would do.

I know Ed and know that what has happened to you must have just been an unfortunate mistake. I see he's sorting you out. Keep us updated!

bitzino.com for me. They've always been fair and honest and they've been around for ages.

Could it be  ?

Thanks for taking the time to look. It really is good though isn't it? I've got nothing to do with the film except I know the people who made it. I want them to be successful!

Well, after lots of emails and scans, and panic, and woe, I am officially out of pocket.
It seems that while satoshicircle.com was being DDOSsed to bits for a week, on 09/30/13, *somehow* (we still don't know how) someone managed to gain access to my 'secret' address and remove 4BTCs from my balance (I was doing well, wasn't I?)
Now SatoshiCircle has been very apologetic and helpful with me about this situation and they have cleared up a few issues I brought up with them. They say that the google search thing, isn't a 'hack' it's just a list of all the secret addresses issued to the search bots when they catalogued the site, so that theory is out of the window.
They suggested that the fault might be at my end in that my PC was hacked (I'm using Linux Ubuntu and am very careful about security) but I ran all kinds of checks and anti-virus scans and came up with precisely nothing.
The ONLY possibility that it 'might' have come from my end is the fact that I do use Firefox Sync and Xmark plug-ins that would have had my secret URL on them. What could I do about that? Uninstall/reinstall? Change passwords?
Anyway, the end result after all these weeks is 'tough shit', SatoshiCircle wont be compensating or refunding me, I suppose if it were my fault I understand that, but I just find it suspicious that they were being attacked at the time and I couldn't even access the site. The money must of came out apparently in a short window of on-time that I never found.
Not happy.
Your thoughts?

Me too, but we call it 'Football' over here ;-)

Great site! Signed up!
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:40:05
It's very reliable. I've been dabbling off and on for over a year and never had an issue. Happy to endorse them. 
(I'm not associated with them beyond being a very satisfied customer!)
Good luck! 
(Got any good bets? ;-)

Actually, there are a few problems. Mail me and I'll list them for you. I don't think you're ready for a Monday launch just yet...

I've used all4btc.com before and initially their service was fast, efficient and communicative. However, with my last order they messed up with the communication side of things so badly that I actually called them on the phone to chase up my order. It's apparent to me that they're an honest business, but I think they've bitten off more than they can chew. They did pay the money as promised, but I did the rest of the work directly with the vendor and have since erased them from my bookmarks. Which is a shame.

Just buying some pretty cloud brushes now....
@_date: 2013-10-01 20:28:20
I've had an email from SatoshiCircle.com offering to help me resolve the problem (that's nice!) but they're asking me for my secret URL as confirmation, now call me Mr.Paranoid, but if the site had been cloned...?

My pal Rob McLellen has made a genuinely great science fiction short film. I've been trying to persuade him to accept bitcoins so his next project has a little bit of a head start. 
Watch the film for free, and if you like it, throw him a little tip by way of a thank you!
Maybe we can persuade him to make a Bitcoin movie....?

Being fair, it was a shitty thing that happened to Bitspend and they were a great company to use (for me). Looking forward to being as good a customer with all4btc very soon...
