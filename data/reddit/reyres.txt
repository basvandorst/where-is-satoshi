Ok so I finally got my XAPO card, looks like this(link Below) says nothing about xapo or bitcoin on it. 
Card is in USD there is 3% fee for any foreign exchange. 1st year is free after that its 12 USD fee.
I purchase something on amazon for 10 bucks so far so good.

Why would this get shadow banned? doesn't make any sense it 100% bitcoin related

So I added funds to the xapo and completely forgot about it. I was busy at the time. I have completed the order and should get the card sometime 2-8 weeks according to this
I will update again once I get the card

So what happens when my phone gets stolen or dropped in water?

Thanks, I currently have 1.2 BTC in a CAD/BTC Market on coinbase but am thinking to diversify it across a few different exchanges. I was a victim of MTGOX

Do you have a better suggestion?

Whats your password?....Kidding
Serious : Have you stayed on one exchange/market or switched?

Yes that can work for cold wallets. But keeping bitcoin on the exchange means I can trade anytime, market tends to move fast.

Thanks, I actually have a Coinbase account. Don't know why i didn't see this.
Turns out ShiftCard is for US residents only. I am currently not in the US

I live near the US boarder and travel to US when I do I use my bitcoin VISA card for cash transactions. Makes it very convenient

First Year is free, next year its 12 bucks for the year.
3% charge on any currency that's not USD. Ive done multiple transactions in USD and CAD no hidden fees
