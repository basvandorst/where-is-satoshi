I have been trading since 2012. That’s what I do, full time. Lot of people think you build Your strategy and you are good for life. It’s not how it goes. You need to change your strategy all the time and sometimes your strategy can work really well and sometimes you could lose money. Even if you have good backtesting results that does not mean it would work in the market. 
There are very good tools out there, but you need to have your thesis to use them well. For that you have to research all the time... that’s where you spend most of your time; in research, trading it self is automated. There is a lot of calculus, statistics, probabilities and linear algebra involved. It takes time to learn the terms to use these things..but it’s not hard if you are interested. The game is to find your strategy before others. It’s fun..
tbh if I had just hodl the Btc since 2012, now I would have been lot more richer than playing the markets. Do I regret trading? Absolutely not.. crypto market has been most interesting and dynamic.. we are far ahead than any other market that ever existed, we use diffent data class and our machine learning models are getting really good. It’s very exciting times we live in. I don’t know if there is any other work that would be more intellectually challenging and rewarding at the same time.
