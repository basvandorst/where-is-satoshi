I work a full time job in between checking bitcoin prices lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:00:47
Thanks for an actual answer - I'm going to hold, I think the price ill go back up and eventually surpass the previous highs, but what I am worried about is how low it will drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:57:54
If you invested in bitcoin I can be sure my investment was a good idea!
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:39:06

2k for BTC oh my oh my I wish
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:39:23
which is also good if you have a good amount in alt coins too ;) my investment into BTC is the same as my investment into ETH, ETC, LTC, XRP, and DASH combined.
When I traded stock a dip would stress me out, with BTC I see a dip and think "Ohh a sale!"
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:36:50
this guy is a problem solver
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:33:31

I am investing a certain amount every time it drops say 300 dollars. so Now I have an investment on BTC at 13400 13700 13800 and 14000.
I bought in for the first time at 14.5k and sold at 16800. 
I feel like I am dreaming I feel like its a scam, except the money I made is in my bank acc....
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:43:25
yeah bit coins gunna be worth nothing in 12 hours time :( but since I'm such a nice guy, lemme buy all ur BTC for 400 dollars a pop
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:04:16
Can someone please compare this current price drop to others in the past with equivalent prices and the % of the drop? 
As someone who bought at 18.750 I'm hodling but math always makes me feel better
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:29:25
I did anyway
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:37:20
a soft, wet glass noodle
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:14:29
jfc if your gunna set your big hairy nuts on the table like that then don't sellout like a bitch. 
I bought a full coin at 18.7k (after making a healthy chunk of that day trading other cryptos) and while I feel like there is a monster truck rolling over my nuts rn, I have enough faith in BTC to HODL like smegal holding the ring as he falls into mt doom - maybe a bad analogy but what I'm trying to say it 
IMMA HODL
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:00:50


Same, I really dont want to be the one to get someone into BTC and then have it crash... I'd feel so guilty
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:50:03
13400 i think
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:01:25
Exactly, I've sold some positions but have a bit into still which I plan on not touching for months no matter what the price does. 
Other chunks I kinda day trade ever few days or so.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:22
The price has dropped from 20k to 11.5 in about 4 days, its totally normal to "not be confident" 
Yeah, I'll sell so that you can get cheaper coins.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:42:11
I want MY money you cannot hold it from me, I dont know how any of this works but I gave you my money and now I dont have my money
WHERE IS MY MONEY
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:54:22
I have 99999999999999999999999999999999999999x^99999999 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:17:58
Bitcoin has made me more money in 12 days than my full time job in 5 months.

I've seen some websites offer Shariah compliant trading, what is that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:03:17


You know I've been hearing that since bitcoin was created pretty much.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:50:46
I've been considering buying a weights bench (thanks bitcoin) but before I was considering it, i NEVER saw anyone mention buying your own weights/etc online, the day I started considering it, I see like 4 comments a week on reddit suggesting this.
wtf I HAVE TO BUY MY OWN, Nah I won't I WILL
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:43:26


Why the fuck are you buying this person 20 dollar double shots? holy shit man just hire a prostitute.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:59:53
Im in a situation where I am working a full time job and have pretty much 0 expenses every week aside from a netflix account and gym membership a five figure sum wasn't much to put into it tbh I live a very privileged position.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:23:37
Thanks a lot
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:54:29


Even leaving bitcoin aside, it absolutely memorizes me that people ever feel entitled to someone elses money.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:00:20


I don't spend *my* time risking *my* money to give it away for no good reason fuuuuuck that.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:45:52


Way to look good bro! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:58:01


That doesnt make you left wing, I'm far-right and I want the same.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:48:37
so Germany?
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:43:00
it requires valid ID
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:26:03
Lets say *hypothetically* someone barely understands that bitcoin is, and they had invested 700 in it, what advice would you give them?
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:48:43


doesnt seem to be any being sold in Ireland, I've spent the last 6 hours trying to find away around this etoro block, their customer support is slow as hell getting back to me
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:33:53
c'mon baby, just the dip
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:53:41
interesting, I don't know much about crypto currencies as I usually trade in stock of defense companies but this sub is a great help.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:03:54
well that was just nutterly disgusting
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:15:26


I think buying a resource for one price and selling it for another means you earned that money.


Go back on your meds.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:23:34
When is this fork due to happen?
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:08:09
I spent 600 on crypto where as my usual expenses are like maybe 10 eur a day I think thats why
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:23:30
ETC is doing well the last 8 hours or so, up 4.62 USD since purchase fingers crossed this continues, I want to get into ETH but my damn bank froze my account due to suspicious activity haha, shit.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:59:54


Illegal immigration, mass immigration I.E people willing to work for lower wages and a surplus of workers drives down the minimum wage. It happened when women entered the work force and it happens with mass immigration. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:52:56
sucks ass, shoulda had my shit in order weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:55:57
that would be awesome and then they can try and get another say two people to invest, and so on and so on. :D
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:57:37

@_date: 2017-11-19 12:58:27
well if you were really my friend you wouldnt want me making a loss on my coin would you? why don't you pay me double for it because thats what real friends do.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:32:48
I see, that I can agree with, I see republicans in all caps and I assume the comment is blaming anyone right of center for the problems we face. Sorry if it came off as overly dismissive, but this is reddit after all and most commenters see right wing or republican and just start hurling insults and smugness.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:07:40
I saw the word "REPUBLICANS" in all caps and decided not to read your post, also, remember that you are a Jew and I'm far right not a Republican. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:51:16
Missed the dip in price bc of account verification issues on etoro :( have now bough in with 1K exciting!
Any guesses on how long 9k will take?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:16:58


SELL IT ALL SELL IT ALL!!
EDIT: My Etc is taking an ass reeming today as well, dunno whats going on.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:24:00
My plan is to buy a lot of ETC and just wait two years and see how it goes. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:56:10
Missed the dip in price bc of account verification issues :( have now bough in with 1K exciting!
But from the advice I see on this sub in the 2 weeks I've been here, the general consensus is:
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:40:31
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:41:20
I was going to buy a bitcoin when it was 437 then said nah, i'll wait for it to crash cant go up much more right?
Then I was going to buy a bitcoin when it was 755 then said nah, i'll wait for it to crash cant go up much more right?
then I was going to buy a bitcoin when it was 1001 then said nah, i'll wait for it to crash cant go up much more right?
Now I'm sad, and buying into it at 7,805.57
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:34:08


Just like when you work for your employer and he gives u a paycheck you feel entitled to that paycheck. 
I don't know if your a communist or a retard (they're usually one and the same) but that is a terrible and deliberate twist of the concept.

I've got 3 lite coins myself, have only lost value since I bought them but I'm looking more towards the long term. 
What do you guys think about ETC? I bought around 20 of them, again I'm looking to the long term.
