Do you expect the exchange rate to drop?
@_date: 2012-09-05 04:42:27
I constantly see people post 'Bitcoin is NOT anonymous' but so far not a single one of these bitcoin hackers have been tracked down.
@_date: 2012-09-05 04:55:32
I lolled too
@_date: 2011-10-17 23:24:21
How many people purchased BTC at 0.0001? Did you?
@_date: 2011-08-01 01:19:21
that is all
@_date: 2011-07-06 02:52:02
Pack it up, bitcoin is over.
@_date: 2011-08-01 01:21:46
No of course not. If it could, anyone's wallet can be cracked and stolen.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:42:40
Not hacked. Fucking lol.
@_date: 2011-06-18 01:20:13
Pretty sure he was lying
@_date: 2011-08-07 00:38:13
Also known as 'speculating on e-currencies'
@_date: 2011-06-20 03:59:47
AKA How can we still trust MtGox?
@_date: 2011-08-07 00:12:33


Speculating on e-currencies?
@_date: 2011-06-15 06:09:24
It's called 'being a cynical bastard' and there's no known cure.
@_date: 2011-10-09 21:30:40
Until someone sets up a derivative market, no. Can't short em.
@_date: 2011-10-19 00:06:04
Schadenfreude   
@_date: 2011-06-21 23:18:30
It's a conspiracy by ATI and General Electric
@_date: 2011-06-21 05:43:30
Wait until MtGox opens the floodgates...
@_date: 2011-06-13 23:21:56
Wait so... did you just use a bad password or something?
Also shame on you for using college money to speculate on e-currency. 
@_date: 2011-06-18 01:20:35
A lulz boat.
@_date: 2011-06-14 02:56:27
Yea you got pwned by re-using your password.
Still you should not have speculated on bitcoins with money you need. Put it in a savings account where it's guaranteed by the government. Bitcoin is not an investment.
@_date: 2011-06-16 03:38:13
Sure just make up more shit why don't you. Still no links = you're full of shit.
In fact, I have a link here just proving how wrong you are:
Suck shit asshole.
@_date: 2011-08-01 01:20:20
fucking millions of dollars too
@_date: 2011-06-21 02:11:33
SELL SELL SELL
@_date: 2011-06-21 23:17:04
No, just most of it :(
@_date: 2011-10-18 08:20:07
I guess you're right, it's irrelevant since it's going back to $0.0001 anyway.
@_date: 2011-06-15 02:30:37
@_date: 2011-06-21 02:18:02
We can't get our fucking BTC out of MtGox!
@_date: 2011-06-15 06:00:20
You're full of shit, I don't see any such thing.
@_date: 2011-09-11 00:32:53
Makes sense cause Silk Road is probably the biggest active Bitcoin based market. Nobody really spends much BTC elsewhere.
@_date: 2011-10-09 21:31:27
Not too long ago BTC was like $20. Then $10. Now $5. Next stop: $2.
@_date: 2011-10-10 00:15:18
$20 -&gt; $5. Great.
@_date: 2011-10-17 22:16:40
$2.60 right now, still think it's going up?
@_date: 2011-06-15 02:56:37
Links? Screenshots? I don't see it.
