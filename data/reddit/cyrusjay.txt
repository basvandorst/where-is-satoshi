You guys realise its harder to add features the bigger your customer base is right? You all act like coinbase is behind. When in fact they are taking a justifiable amount of time to do what they have to do. Fuck the "I wanna use my bitcoin right this second or ill cry!!!" People on this site.

But we wouldn't know if you tampered with it even with original seal. What technology exists in the seal that makes it 100%? People repackage stuff very well these days.

Might go back to school one of these years. What should i study to better help the crypto world? Computer science I assume? Maybe cyber security or something? I don't know much but i want to learn!!!

But they've already lit the torches. It's sad they can't see how different it is to run an exchange waay bigger than the others.

Marks been talking about it for awhile now.

I dont understand whats taking so long for other exchanges to introduce apps... probably huge security risks and shit but damm
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:55:14
Do they have an app?

It's cute that you guys think this petition will speed up the process. Dont waste your time it will happen when it happens. Maybe we should be making petitions to get other exchanges to design easy to use interfaces so we can just take coinbase customers. Because we all know that's whats keeping them over there. Yet to see something as nice.

I dont make the rules. I knows it's just misspelled, but now it's a meme.

Are you really that stupid? You must be playing Right?
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:06:10
Because they are waiting for real competition. Why give the market away?

I know many people who cant be bothered by any thing but coinbase. It's 1000% more user friendly than the next leading exchange.

I'm saving to watch on my lunch!

How do I know how much my bitcoin is worth without the internet?

Coinbases reputation was only ruined for people who don't understand  business structure

Why everybody obsessed with lambos? Even if i had the money to I would never buy one, by far one of the ugliest supercars...
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:32:50
This! Seriously can people not think these days?

They are the WalMart of their field.
