'Bitcoin miners and internet traders accepting Bitcoins for goods and services will be taxed on profits, with fluctuations in the value of the cryptocurrency reflected in the profits on which UK taxes are payable.'
For mining, does the word 'profit' indicate that the initial investment for mining hardware cost does not need to be declared/taxed?

this is all probably designed for these celebs to have a tarnished view of BTC so none of them will endorse it in the future...

ahh I see the first part makes sense to me. 
So until it 'realised' it is not taxable, and only becomes realised when traded into GBP/USD.
