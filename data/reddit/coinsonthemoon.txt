FaceCoin incoming 
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:04:19
But how else do you know it's a crypto currency?

Ahh, but Bitcoin isn't hardware, and software always updates 
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:53:00
There it is bois, the buy signal
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:12:11
What if "cashing out" doesn't exist because cash won't be worth anything and BTC will be a medium of exchange in a digital economy?
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:43:19
A lot more on the line, maybe a smaller trade with leverage? Go long on Bitcoin lol

Bitcoin is the future 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:03
Adopted as the magical Internet money multiplier... Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:10:03
Store supply management, most of the financial sector, record labels, Realtors, governance, name any industry. Blockchain and crypto will disrupt it
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:44:21
I actually heard the same thing, I think people are scared of market futures on Wall Street... 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:26:11
I thought it was 2140 no doubt tho by 2030 the difficulty will be harder 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:30:18
What's that? I couldn't hear you over the terrorism
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:36:42
I thought we'd eventually just value Bitcoin at the lambo rate 
1 BTC = 1 Lambo (stock of course)
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:47
I do, but new money... Nah they don't know what the fuck is happening but their investment is looking good 
Edit: damn, it's already been 4 weeks, time for a new account again! Lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:41:05
 it's hard to follow an argument that is written like this 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:56:46
New phone, who dis?
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:17:22
I explained this to my grandparents and they said they like the idea, but hate the fact that it's not just American, I believe I heard "those commie bastards might get a hold of it"
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:15:06
Yeahhhh, idk what you want me to say
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:33:59
If someone does figure it out, all other computers on the network will cancel it. It's distributed. I'd find it hard to believe that one group of hackers could hack every single computer on the ledger. 
I encourage everyone to run a node as that strengthens the network
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:05:06
Steam dropping BTC hurts this, we can't get adopted at this rate of acceleration
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:23:50
It's funny to me that they haven't been teaching about block chain in major universities until just this year, and even that is limited. This tech will disrupt the world in a really big way the next 3-5 years. It will render a lot of jobs obsolete. College should be ahead of the game in this regard 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:21:32
Go all in while it's cheap and cover the loss with your income later on. DCA is getting out dated with this kind of growth 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:36:22
That's how it works, Alts are losing value right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:47:30
The Internet is the powerhouse of knowledge right now. Pretty Much Free (50 bucks a month), unlimited knowledge on any subject, updated to the present, and it's got endless reach across the world. Colleges are stuck (or seem to be) in an echo chamber of outdated knowledge, Communist views, and student loans. 
I don't wanna bash on college too much, it's good for some degrees. Doctors, engineers, and whatnot. But even those will change in the coming years with AI advancement. And college will be behind on that yet... Again 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:26:55
Only do it on shitcoins so you can save more bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:06:36
What goes pump, must go dump.. The Alts aren't going to feel the love after this one either

probably priced in already tho
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:10:36
It's a crypto currency, and it will be used as a currency some time. Bitcoin will be updated we just need to find consensus and move forward to the same beat. We will find a way to scale. Mass adopt and free the people with their own money supply. We grew too fast this year and that just makes Devs have to work harder (which sucks) 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:33:44
Haha yes!
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:12:15
An attack on BTC
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:25:15
remember BAKKT?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:46:28
If we end up riding the 10k line for a day, expect a bull run to 12k or 15k even. If we don't consolidate and just smack our head on the 10k sell wall we dropping down a ways for a healthy pull back 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:59:58
On the moon!

*guitar strum*
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:15:37
You win some, you lose most. I love the exciting moments but I'd say I would have a bit more coinage just hodling 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:30:56
"Store of value" was never the original plan, that being said. Buy the Dips and HODL until we can use the true value 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:38:23
Bitcoin on the moon
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:04:41
I'm hoping for 5000 dollar pullback, it'll be healthy to let the 200 day moving average catch up. Maybe hit 10k consolidate and break to the down side?! If it breaks to the upside, the Bulls ain't ever gonna stop and the rocket ship is launching 
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:09:33
She is worth trillions 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:35:20
There's always times you want to sell just to cash out, congrats on the 21 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:33:45
"The BTC"!! And yes, it'll be around a long, long time, we have a bright future we just need miner consensus to get our upgrades, for now HODL and run a node if you can 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:52:43
Shitcoins flipped to bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:57:10
Yeah, probably, but we still need some solution. We as a community should try and scale Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:30:26
People don't understand percentages, this in turn creates a very irrational market!!! I love crypto!!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:19:32

I think Trump might've tweeted about it too, his nicknames tend to stick 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:51:05
Hahaha I was thinking the same thing, that target might not ever hit tho
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:41:19
That game is soooo hard

Got about 50 percent more for a "crash" still I wouldn't be happy with losing that much lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:05:27
"They" are trying to sell the network 
Edit: oversell (to slow it down)
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:19:38
This will be the next step
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:06:56
This is some TA I can buy into

Yeah, I gotcha, Roger Ver has done good things for Bitcoin though, you can like somebody and not like their scaling solution lol

@_date: 2017-11-15 01:13:03
Yes! Works in the market too, always buy More Apple Stock right after they launch a new phone. (Idk why it works like that but it does) 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:55:18
Hope you don't get automated by the blockchain! Good luck to you 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:59:56
She's the one, go after her 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:37:35
I would, it's easier to transfer money around the globe with Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:36:16
One thing I've learned. TA only helps on Pullbacks other wise it's nonsense 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:54:24
Haha the same thing bro
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:26:32

@_date: 2017-11-26 04:19:25
Haha wait wasn't the price like 600 dollars cheaper?!
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:08:39
2 rules...
1. HODL
2. Buy the dips 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:10:23
The bear market after mt gox was a longgggg time
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:42:20
Spend Litecoin, HODL Bitcoin just in case the dollar collapses
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:30:44
Friday night turn up 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:07:14
We need a solution, no doubt. Or we keep it as store of value and use good ole Bitcoin Silver (litecoin) for everyday. But chuck should keep the price of litecoin to 1/4 or 1/10 of Bitcoin all the time. I know he can't dictate the market but still, it'd be useful for everyday 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:05:43
Finally, a TA I can get behind 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:05:40
We wait
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:13:53
Buy the dips and HODL
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:39
"Hold on for Dear Life"

@_date: 2017-11-21 02:01:10
Yeah, happened to like 20 different coins, BTC was around 8200 at the time. Not at the ATH yet... 
Edit: Bitcoin also had a sell off but it was held up by other exchanges... Bitcoin Cash had a big volume spike sooooo idk fam
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:58:58
It was a good HODL tho. Just had to get a life for a while
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:07:59
except not... cuz 2013 and 2014 was the same
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:27:51
