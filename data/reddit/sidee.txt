Litecoin (not LiteCoin) really isn't better suited for it. It might be better right NOW for micro transactions, but miners will eventually expect to be paid market price for transactions just like on the Bitcoin network.

This thread is about security of large amounts of $70.000 and similar amounts, not hoarding vs. spending. I was addressing question, not your post.
If you're fine with that amount of security for vast amount of your savings in Bitcoin, that's your own choice. For $70.000 I would not keep the majority in Bitcoin-qt with encryption on my computer.
I do however have a small spending amount easily accessible for the few things I wish to spend bitcoins on.

While I wasn't necessarily criticizing your reply but adding my personal opinion on the matter, I think having users give fair warning to the substantial risk of investing/buying bitcoins is a good thing. Obviously in a well mannered and constructive way explaining why it's considered high risk.
Someone losing, with more than 10 % net worth in bitcoin, should/would be scared of losing money. These posts are usually made my new bitcoin buyers. There's a threshold where dislike turns to scared of losing a lot of money.
A responsible investor would already be aware of these points. Most people aren't necessarily responsible investors, and there's not much information to go on from OP.

I haven't said saroshi could, I'm saying if satoshi holds 10 % of every bitcoin it's possible to manipulate exchange rate quite easily, even at high volumes. I doubt it's ever going to be a problem, but that's why I wouldnt want anyone to hold a large percentage of the money supply
@_date: 2013-08-03 17:14:56
Bitcoin, not BitCoin by the way.
@_date: 2013-06-08 04:16:45
the lack of self critique in is what makes a lot of the content here really bad. Then we get the tinfoilers and anarchists pushing their agenda while using bitcoin as a tool to do so. And not to mention if you're not a libertarian you're not morally allowed to have an interest in bitcoin.

That's the thing. "Trusted party" is what a lot of other non-profits have. At some point the organization will have expenses. That being salaries, travel expenses or similar.
Asking poor people log on and beg for money on the internet may also be very dehumanizing. While giving "little Marvin" a new mattress might be a fantastic thought, other non-profits may focus more removing poor people from poverty all-together. For instance micro finance, building water wells, eradicating diseases (e.g Gates foundation) and building sustainable solutions.
I think it's great that you're thinking about this, but I'm not convinced running a website where people can apply for donations will be more effective than existing work being done.
Building infrastructure, removing crippling national debt in poor countries or improving educational systems are far more effective measures. But these are rather large scale. I'm not sure how Bitcoin would help here. Maybe as a money transmitter infrastructure and giving everyone financial freedom and security.

This is the only sensible comment regarding deflation vs inflation I've seen on Sadly there's a lot of people blinded by hate for any authority, while failing to discuss in depth the different mechanics of the economy as whole.

I would probably avoided that myself, as it's a common misspelling.
I would probably have changed "Criticism" with "Misconceptions".  There are some valid criticism of Bitcoin, just not the ones you listed. :)

Either way, good riddance. Either he provides proof of some sort or Paypal announce it in their own.
I don't think it's true anyway. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 00:28:04
I don't believe Paypal is adding Bitcoin, but banning bitcoin/mining hw doesn't surprise me. High risk and probably not profitable for Paypal.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:37:57
Huh? I agree with a lot of what you're saying. I think you need to calm down.
$70.000 should be properly tinfoilery secured, whether it is a good idea to keep that amount in bitcoin or not is irrelevant. You're bringing up a lot of different aspects outside proper wallet security.

I would much rather like to have first 'closed loop' economy related to soap/soap production than, for instance, silk roadesque products. Not because I have strong convictions opposing personal drug use, but soap is less controversial in mainstream media (so far;)).
I sincerely doubt gas will ever reach a closed loop economy though. That being said, keep on trucking!

Scams are inevitable using your method.
I would rather donate to a reputable charity than listen to a potentially fake and unverifiable sob story.

And you'd end up in prison. Hardly worth it.
He cashed out about 1/5 to buy the apartment iirc. He'll be ok even if the property plummets, and even then he bought an apartment in Tøyen which is likely to maintain its value considering the location.

I may have misunderstood what you mean or I may not understand what you're exactly trying to say.
There are some inefficient and dubious "charities" out there, and there are others which operates more efficiently. If I understand you correctly you suggest cutting out the "middleman" in the donation chain and send money directly to the individuals.
I've got huge respect for Jason, but he's a middleman. I don't see how it's possible to run charities without people like him? I think it's unreasonable to expect people to work without salaries unless they choose to themselves. And most people don't have the luxury of being able to live off their existing wealth to work for free.
Maybe you could explain a little more in detail what exactly your idea is, and how it's more efficient than how current charities operates?
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:05:44
depending if he holds other assets than those $2000, I would never recommend having more than 5-10% of total net worth in Bitcoin.
So if all bills are paid, but those $2000 is everything he owns, he's way too over exposed to high risk investments (by conventional standards).
@_date: 2013-10-31 11:36:04
The problem most people have with him/her/they owning possibly 10 % isn't because of the insane wealth, but owning a substantial percentage of the total money supply. At 10 % we're talking considerably centralization of the protocol.
That makes Bitcoin susceptible to manipulation from a single individual even as Bitcoin grows.
@_date: 2013-08-24 12:16:57
If Bitcoin still exists, yes. If not, no?
You're planning a mining op in 2020, but you're asking if ASIC's are worth it. I think you gonna need to do more research before you set this plan in stone.
Honestly I probably wouldn't even start planning before 2019 depending on the current system. If you're interested in mining for financial gain (duh), if Bitcoin has survived 'till then the margins from mining will be small. So small that there's unlikely a one man op gonna be able to compete.
Either way, no one here can accurately predict the future.

If the money is in your account I think it's pretty safe assuming they know its yours. If you had bought an apartment using bitcoin (which is unprecented in Norway afaik) the broker is very likely obligated to disclose it as if it was cash. If the seller doesn't use a broker, he is obligated to disclose it.
If you have large bank wires to your account it is automatically reported and you risk getting your bank account frozen unless you disclose the sources of those funds.
Of course if you exchanged using localbitcoin for cash (really?), you COULD escape paying capital gains on it, but what would you spend the money on? You cant buy anything worthwile and you'd have to launder the money into your own personal finances for years. Good luck finding anyone willing to dish out $850k in cash.
I think you better plan your tax avoidance scheming a while longer before you take a stab at it ;)

I sincerely doubt the rumors in this thread to be true, and should be ignored 'till it's verified. Even if he provides proof that he works there, it's not proof that paypal is intregrating Bitcoin in any way.
Thread seems to have been removed anyway.
@_date: 2013-08-04 04:16:19
I just realized calling you a middleman was very belittling the work you've done and keep doing. I didn't mean to imply middleman as necessarily negative or unnecessary. But more as a necessary "facilitator" or entrepreneur.
That being said, I'm completely oblivious to how charities/non-profits operate in North America as I reside in a very different society. But what I do believe, is that people like you is necessary to run it efficiently and successfully.

That's complicated question to answer. 99 % of the homeless are that by choice as there are government housing alternatives (for everyone). No one is forced to live on the streets, but they may prefer it.
I've talked to a few native homeless that preferred living outside because they felt the living conditions in these alternatives were less than optimal. 
Depending on geographical location, you're entitled to approximately ~$2,500/month government aid (cost of living is comparable to NYC). If I had to guess I would guess that the causes of most homeless or semi-homeless are substance abuse and/or psychological disorders.
And Europe in general has a huge problem with nomadic people mainly from Romania settings up camp everywhere.
This isn't really my area of expertise though, but I have shared a lot of conversations with a few homeless people.

Ah yes, the terrible social policies we enjoy over here, including owning 1% of all publicly traded stocks.
It's a mixed market leaning heavily towards a free market. Norway would still be doing pretty well without oil and gas.
