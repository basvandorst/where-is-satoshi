The US is about to discontinue the penny. So, save yours up. They will soon become a collectors item!
@_date: 2014-04-13 09:18:46
Please send me your pennies. Also, the penny is useful. One more fault with government currency, they can't devalue it fast enough. Bitcoin can go as low as it needs too.

Yea I know, but a man can hope right?
@_date: 2012-01-16 00:28:29
That also makes no sense.

Anyone want to bet on me?

I hope they still release the returns. I bet they do like a week before the election. Then Romney will get arrested right quick.

Who gives accreditation to these schools? Does the entrance test raise the price of lawyers? Who flies the most complaints about lawyers to disbar them? I mean, why the hell did it take so long for Jack Thompson to be disbarred, if its a good system? Why can't the system of peer review journals also apply to lawyers?

Capital G god huh?
Governments really shouldn't have a monopoly on the law. Bitcoin is all about breaking government control of money right? I'm a big fan of jury nullification, aggressive use of pardons, etc. Lawyers existing completely outside of government might be a great idea along those lines. I'm very uncomfortable with lawyers and politicians moving in and out of the public sector so easily.
All of your points only make sense if the identity of the lawyer and the client were know to each other. If both parties were anonymous, and the details of the clients care are kept relativity ambiguous, then how might this harm either party? I interpreted this post as advice on, would I get sued if I did this, is this sort of business legal, etc, not a computer screen in a court room. I mean, did you even read the OP?
Yea the digital enlightenment is pretty cool. Please try to go at least one sentence without describing something sickening?
Also, how could determine that I'm dense by three sentences? Maybe I'm a 12 old kid that has no clue how the legal system works. Was it the bird law comment? Because hummingbirds are illegal tender in this country.

If a lawyer was working for me, well then I would be able to afford one.

Do not listen to these naysayers. This is maybe the best use of Bitcoins anyone has every came up with. You will be doing a great service to humanity if you do this. Bitcoin is all about freedom. The freedom of information is the most basic of human rights. Your time and work is valuable, you should be compensated, but the value of your knowledge should not be inflated by a government. Of course, be careful, don't try to get yourself into trouble, but at the same time, remember that the high points of human courage were of individual men standing up to tyranny.
I'm no lawyer, and I've used this account enough the world knows who I am, Grover Cleveland, but I'd be willing to do whatever in my power to help you make this happen. Good luck.

From my experience a lot of lawyers are incompetent. So yea more or less what is even the point of it, I say just get rid of it. It seems like you would agree more or less.

I've been in Masters since beta more or less. I was on vaction for two months and thus fell out of Masters. Almost back in already. So, want to bet on me?

Alright, I was just a little angry about how much the bar was mentioned over all the comments. Really though, what is the function of the bar? No, what even is the bar, because I haven't researched it as much as other aspects of law. Isn't the bar an association that corrects the mistakes of other lawyers, giving them peer review, and only letting in skill and educated lawyers right? If you want the law to be really fair, then why not let every single person on earth help with this?
@_date: 2011-09-17 02:14:09
Yea so just let the public do it.
The problem this guy has with starting is that it would be unethical. But its unethical because it wouldn't be part of the bar. But you join the bar to be ethical. See what I'm saying. I think its a bit of a catch-22. 
I wouldn't say something stupid like you can't hang out in a /r/ if you don't share the views of the /r/ itself. But I would think that anyone who wants Bitcoins also has libertarian views. So the market itself will tell which lawyers are competent enough to serve. 
I don't quite know what law school even teaches, or how much of it is even need. I might say that about the rest of the school. I say that lawyers just train from the ground up in law firms themselves. 
Its a little absurd to say that you can only know something if you're part of an association.

What does being on the bar have to do with whether or not advice is correct? If you gave me some legal advice, and I repeated word for word, would that advice magically become incorrect?
@_date: 2011-09-15 20:08:14
That's maybe the best idea I've ever heard. How would this violate your ethics? You should be able to contract your knowledge to anyone for anything.
Do you know much about bird law?

Thanks for backing me up. Ents are always good people by me.
