I'm afraid the only payment I can offer you is my immense gratitude and the knowledge you've been a huge help to someone in need. The university doesn't really give me much of a research budget to offer anything more than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:31:59
Thanks heaps. It's a huge help. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:19:25
Thank you very, very much! You can tip people with gratitude, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:18:04
I know. And thanks heaps. It really appreciate it.

Sorry for the delayed response. Time zones will forever be the bane of my existence. I've heard some people have had difficulties on mobile, but I can't seem to find the cause or how to fix it. If the problem persists - and you're still willing - I'd recommend switching to another device. Apologies for the inconvenience!

Thank you. My background is in sociology.

Hey, Ether. I'm afraid not, due to university ethical guidelines as well as more practical benefits. By doing the survey via the link, it ensures that the process is completely anonymous, which isn't something that I can guarantee to the same extent here. It also sorts the raw data for me, so that I can more easily run tests on it. Are there any particular concerns about the link that I can help you with?
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:40:13
Thank you very much. It'll be a while before it's ready for publication, but I'll do my best to make it accessible to anyone interested. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 09:19:44
I'm afraid that there isn't much that I can do in that regard. The website and survey software is all provided to me by the university, based on what they have the licensing for. 
Regarding the possibility of sampling problems, there are already issues due to the pseudonymous, globally-diffused, and unreachable nature of a lot of the user base. I've tried to correct for these to make the survey as scientifically accurate as possible, but it isn't the only data collection method being employed with this research, with others serving to help verify or disprove these particular findings.

Thank you very much!

Thank you very much!

Thanks for clarifying all of this for me. The only thing that I would add is that if anyone still has any concerns about my authenticity, you can contact my supervisor and/or the Research Office of my university. Their details are attached on the first page of the link, but you can also independently verify their email over the official Federation University website.

Thank you very much. A lot of publications have a paywall, but I'll try to find a way to post a free-to-access version for everyone who helped me out. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 11:32:37
Thank you very much, both for filling out the survey and for the kind words. You've already been a huge help. I really appreciate it.

Hey, Penzance. Thanks for taking the time to fill in the survey and point out the problem you're having. Although I have all the questions set on mandatory to make sure I don't get a bunch of partially completed results thrown into the mix, you can write anything into the box and it will accept it. So if you feel you don't have an answer to a question or it doesn't apply to you, you can just write a sentence explaining that or even just a simple N/A. I hope that helps and thanks again for taking the time. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 09:21:49
Thank you. It's definitely proven to be an interesting field. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 10:08:36
Thanks heaps, I really appreciate it. I'll be sure to come back and share the findings once they're published. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 03:45:46
Thank you very much. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 03:46:32
Thanks heaps for the help. And I'm afraid I'm at another campus, which is a shame since it sounds really interesting. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 10:21:07
Thank you very much. Every response is a huge help for me. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:26:29
Thank you very much! I really can't understate what a help it is. I study sociology and I'm trying to determine what motivates users at the individual level to adopt cryptocurrency, how they appreciate and understand various forms of economic risk (both in the crypto and mainstream markets), and their investment habits. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:20:19
Thank you. It's much appreciated. :)
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:27:57
Thanks for helping. I really appreciate it. I won't be at the publication stage until early next year, but once I get there this subreddit will be the first to know. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:25:55
Every response gets me closer. Thanks heaps. It's much appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:02:07
Thanks heaps for the feedback. It always helps. Like you said, it's too late to change it this time around. But since it's impossible to predict everything, feedback is useful for refining and improving it in the future. I'll be sure to keep those points in mind. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:40:25
I'm really sorry that you can't take part in the survey. I would have been interested in hearing what you and everyone else under 18 has to say, but Frogolocalypse is right. On top of the extra steps I'd have to take in dealing with minors, I'd also have to go through a much longer ethical review process that would have set me back months. 
Sorry again and thanks for the interest. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:52:12
Thanks heaps for helping out. It's much appreciated, especially since diverse opinions and views help capture the nuance of such a broad community. Ethereum is definitely something I'm interested in conducting research on. Once I graduate and I'm not locked in with my current focus, I plan on checking it out. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:36:13
Thanks heaps. Every completion is a huge help for me. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:35:27
Struth, you little ripper! And no worries, mate. You're true blue. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:30:35
The pseudonymous, decentralised, and globally-diffused nature of the Bitcoin user base forces researchers interested in human data to get it wherever it's available. It's less than ideal, but with the proper methodology - and by not using it as your sole source of data collection, so you have points of comparison - it can be helpful. 
That acknowledgement aside, I've been pleasantly surprised by how friendly and helpful (most) people have been here. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:28:16
Thank you very much, both for the well wishes and the help. It's much appreciated.
