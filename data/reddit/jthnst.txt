Thanks, I’ll have a look. I have been meaning to try btcmarkets but just never got around to it. Now’s the time I guess!
And yep, coinspot!

I use coinspot, Melbourne based. But at premium but also sell at premium. Verification takes a day and the transactions are instant.

They have considerably longer timeframes though. Look at the width of their grid lines.

Curious what industry your company is in?

It’s just a correction. Stay calm this always happens. It’ll go back up.

I thought you were quoting Eminem lyrics for a second then.

Can you not give a summary? (You have to pay to read the article)
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:14:33
I’d pay a lot more than $2000

Bitcoin is a currency, or, a store of funds / value, so this is perfect for what you’re wanting to do. 
After all, Bitcoin sees no borders. 
How long would the process take? Depends on whether you’re both verified with an exchange in your own countries. 
If yes, they’d be able to send you the $2000 within minutes. If not, you’d both have to register accounts, then (probably) wait x amount of days to be verified (as there’s probably restrictions about purchases / withdrawals if you’re not verified). 
Is it safe? It’s incredible safe, every single transaction is on a public ledger to see. Just don’t leave the money on exchanges as people will try and hack them (heck, just like you have people trying to hack PayPal or banks). 
And no, you won’t get in trouble, this is it’s purpose.

Hahaha excellent.

Guy at the end had to ruin it didn’t he!

Just got off the phone with Satoshi... he said it’s for him to know and for you to find out.

There is, there’s a link to another reddit post. Obviously can’t see it [so here you go](

They don’t.

No, it doesn’t. Most places are “,”
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:00:13
Totally agree. Any other way just seems dumb to me.

Greggs sausage rolls. The only thing I miss since moving to Aus. In a cold pack of 4 ready to go! Take me back!

Using local bitcoin is your best option. There's loads of "cash buy" on there for Australian cities. 
However, don't sell more than you need, as when you leave the country and you have over 10k in cash at the border, you'll certainly be stopped, that's their limit for over the border.
