So your claim is that someone is creating artificial supply, but then matching it with artificial demand.  This would not affect the price.

I'm glad someone said it.  I've been reading this subreddit for the past 48 hours laughing my ass off.

Same,  made a post last week at $150 reminding everyone that no one ever lost money taking a profit, got flamed.

it can also go down

If you actually clicked on the website rather than reading the directory folder you would realize that bots flood the stock market with hundreds of thousands of untradable quotes every second to manipulate stock prices.  Website was created because of the flash crash, but uncovered so much more than just flash crash research.

And now you're frozen, not sure what to do.  It might keep going down so you feel you should sell, but then again what if it goes up, you'll feel like an idiot.

Isn't it just a cathartic experience?  The fear you feel?  This is why less than 15% of people can trade profitably. Money has an equally powerful effect on the brain as cocaine.

It depends how you view Bitcoin. Is it a currency? Or it is more like gold? You are long the investment vehicle Bitcoin, which while uncontrolled (yet) by a government entity, is still, at best, fiat. 
However, I contest that it isn't currency as it fails one criterion to be a currency and I could probably debate a second one.
It is not easily transportable.  In fact, it isn't transportable at all without an active internet hookup.  If the power goes out you cant get your money?  Not good.
Also, yet to be tested, is the ability to counterfeit it.  In theory it can't be, but how long will it take for that to be contested by someone like China?
So, as I argue, you may not realize it, but you are speculating on an investment vehicle.  One that no one understands the risks to.  One that people aren't even sure how to classify yet.  I know I will be able to use my gold tomorrow, and I am reasonably confident my USD will still have spending power in a month.  However, I don't see any reason anyone can be reasonably assured that the US government won't make Bitcoin illegal, or try to regulate, or people will realize that the Bitcoin value graph is parabolic.
Am I saying its a bad investment? No. I just think everyone should know what they are putting their money into and know that its okay to take it out.  
Also, the USD value of Bitcoin has declined 24% since I posted.

Which is why it never made sense that coins got above $10
edit: or $0

What was the trading system you used to secure these gains?  If it was guesswork and luck then what makes you think you'll be so lucky the second time around?

even the Fed leaks its minutes to congress and Wall St before releasing to the public..

which is also not random and luck, but a long selection process where ineffective methods and genes die out.

Could you expand on the technological edge present in your HFT?

what exactly are the fundamentals of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:07:16
This happens in the stock exchanges.  Read: 
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:57:48
HFT is sold as a liquidity providing source when in reality, while there is a large volume of HFT activity and tons of HFT algos moving in different directions during normal price movement, in times of major price moves, news, or other fundamental changing events most algos react the same and that liquidity immediately evaporates causing events such as the flash crash.
Also, algos are by and large dumb.  They take headlines at face value.  If unemployment numbers come in and beat expectations, but the report indicates that because of late data 7 states numbers were estimated (read: made up) the algo misses the nuance and trades on the headline thereby removing the market from fundamentals and tying it to headlines.  However, since HFT is about 40% of the market it doesn't matter what the fundamentals are.
Lastly, your first point is that the algo can decide and execute a trading decision before you.  While this is true, it isn't purely due to processing power.  Since HFT servers are co-hosted in the NYSE an algo can trade many times before your first order even gets to the exchange.  Even if you sent your first order at the same time as the algo.

Yea.  Don't.

Supply and demand isn't based on luck and happenstance.  Walmart didn't grow to be a retail giant because people got lost, wandered into a store, money fell out of their pocket, and they left with items.  Humans create supply and demand and human action is not a collection of independent random events, and therefore, is not luck.

I think its random and luck that you're able to find your way to the internet and type words
