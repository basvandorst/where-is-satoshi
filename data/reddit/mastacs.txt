As a fellow moose rider and igloo builder, coinbase is the easiest way to get your maple syrup fund started. Gdax is good as well and you can link your coinbase account to it and save on the transaction fee.

Raiden network.

Do some research. I know there's a few wallet recovery services. They only charge you if they can recover the wallet.

Blind ignorance is a beautiful thing.

Thanks for the comment. What advantage aside from current network size does lighting network have over something like the raiden network?
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:28:22
All great points but my underlying question would be if raiden can scale as fast as the lightning network why not just use eth for value transfer? What benefit is that at that point you continue to use Bitcoin?

If giving reasonable responses and opennly coversating about a topic is blind and ignorant then you are very correct good sir. 
Write that down.

It's a two way street. Both sides silence individuals. If you fail to see that then you clearly are the shill.
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:03:18
Yikes... 
1) Your lack of elaboration and passive aggressive response indicates you struggle debating let alone even conversating. 
2) That is something any blockchain can provide security from. Cryptography is a beautiful thing.

I own 0 of either Bitcoin, rendering your subreddit comment(s) useless. If that's the case then explain any other application it has.
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:22:20
The man, the legend.
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:05:48
In what way? All the points you've mentioned reflect essentially every blockchain created that utilize distributed legers.
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:06:57
Thank you for actually making good points and not having a hissy fit like the rest of the subreddit the second someone questions their beliefs.
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:52:23
How is it more decentralized? I'd say the contrary if you're basing it off the miners.
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:08:25
I know right? Some one that makes plausable sense should never be seen on this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:03:21
Bitcoin will receive a new address every time it received an incoming transaction. If you go to trezor in the transactions tab do you see the transaction with under "unconfirmed"? 
If that's the case you just need to wait for the transaction to be mined. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:15:58
If you go to coinbase does it show a transaction ID?
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:02:00
Is either of the output addresses yours? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:48:25
Reinstall the firmware.

Hundo and tree fiddy. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:23:06
Install the Leger manger chrome application
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:08:22
Can you give me the transaction ID? Does the transaction have any confirmations? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:03:02
I would respectfully disagree. The amount of tunnel-visioned bitcoin maximalists in this subreddit is insane.
