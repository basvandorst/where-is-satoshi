I believe that if you have them send it via the "friends and family" option it won't allow a charge back.

There's a Burger King several hours away from me that's entirely different from the BK everywhere else... They existed before BK and won a lawsuit to be able to stay in the town and BK is not allowed.

I thought you ment Dope the band...I was going to ask to be your friend. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:03:11
Not sure, but I recall them saying they asked for one number and actually got a higher number approved. 
There is also always local bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:20:14
Where have you been.... 
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:31:06
Don't forget silver.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:18:18
I've heard circle will up your limit if you ask them too. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 22:02:13
Buy low, sell high. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:25:21
Send the money to PayPal and then to your exchange? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:55:02
Do your parents want to adopt me? 
@_date: 2015-08-28 00:12:45
About three fiddy. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:44:55
Also could be based on your browsing.
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:13:31
It could be a third party ad service serving said ads? 
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:15:09
The bottom one was actually backed by something (silver.)
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:24:41
Best thing would be sell it for a few dollars to a collector. Unless it's a rare/error one, then they can be worth a decent amount. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:24:40
Is it not bad enough they force a 20% tip, now drivers want more? 
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:38:51
But if they claim they automatically tack in 20% for drive gratuity and do not give it to the driver would that not be illegal as well? 
I've been a chauffer before and one of my dispatch companies did have a 20% built in as he did every thing electronically, so no cash ever changed hands. Never once did I not get it, even turned down cash tips and reminded people they had a built in one. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:11:21
Send me one? 
@_date: 2015-04-21 23:37:34
They claim it disables it like knox....I know the S4 and S5 have methods of roots that don't mess with Knox. I'd imagine it won't be long till we get root without causing interference. 
I just dislike how android claims to be open source then locks you down when on the phone. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 23:33:12
O no! The government will have to actually investigate things? They can't just siphon off all are electronic data to comb through. 
Won't someone think of the children! /s
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:15:05
Or you could give me some bitcoins and I'll confirm it for you. ;-) 
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:09:30
Localbitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-03-03 22:16:29
Hmm mine doesn't have that. Then again it's showing me as having a different version. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 03:24:29
VPN and do that shit online?
Or tell me what to do and I'll do it. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:58:08
Why thank you. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:04:05
Was this on a cell network or WiFi? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:37:57
You should be doing that anyway. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:05:32
Hi :) 
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:21:46
I'd diversify. Some bitcoin, some gold/silver and some properties. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:49:36
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:55:30
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:53:24
Oo I like free stuff! 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:53:40
Did you complete the verification? Maybe they keep sending it thinking it didn't go through? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:02:47
Could have something to do with US banking laws? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:34:28
Are you buying with a debit/credit card? 
They need a bank account to pay out.
