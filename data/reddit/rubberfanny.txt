Only minimal variance would be allowed on miners block. Miner cannot create a block in the past compared to current block, if the block timestamp is too far off a nodes time surely the node would reject the block forcing the miner to be close enough to honest with time?
@_date: 2016-04-13 02:45:13
Yes that's right. But if you have economies built up around blockchain and you're an enemy nation wanting to attack the economy.....so you're motivation is not financial but instead disruption then it becomes more feasible.
@_date: 2016-04-20 10:40:07
As mentioned by the poster above me, the difficulty hasn't lowered yet as nowhere near block 2016 and so still just as difficult to mine a block. (In my scenario)
@_date: 2016-04-21 02:41:21
I believe the time drift does have a set limit in variance tho, +- 70 mins I think I saw in the protocol wiki. But if another miner lies all the other honest nodes will reject the lying miners block.
@_date: 2016-04-21 02:42:56
Surely the 8% as opposed to the 2% would be acceptable because it's retargeted at smaller intervals? So if you're out by 8% for yesterday, offset that 8% today. Rinse repeat every 24hrs and because it's only a day not 2 weeks the network should tolerate wild fluctuations better, I think? 
@_date: 2016-04-21 02:41:53
I thought F2Pool were behind sole of those huge installations with racks and racks of ASICs, they are also known as Discofish yea? But anyway assume like 75% of the network hashing power was wipes out in say a war or targeted terrorist attack etc. I know that block time isn't dead on accurate, but don't honest nodes keep it accurate enough? You never achieve a 2 week exact 2016 block timeline anyway so surely block time is accurate enough as I believe block time is used to calculate difficulty as is?
@_date: 2016-04-13 02:42:56
No, you can't pick and chose a chain, the protocol does it. It would require a fork or implementation in consensus to force on particular chain.

Yea this. Encrypted wallet file put inside truecrypt volume (use two distinct passwords) and then you can plop it on OneDrive etc. and yes make sure 2 factor auth is on for OneDrive etc. I think it is actually the best way to protect against loosing bitcoin as you can't really loose it from the cloud unless you delete it (OneDrive has a 30 day recycle bin dunno bout others) and yea it's backup taken care of. What constitutes something that cannot be bruteforced tho? Any thing can be bruteforced it's a matter if it's easy or not and online you don't know the computing power of your adversaries so whilst you can assume you are bruteforce safe do you really know for sure?

Wow thanks dude! My first post post and first tip :D
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:25:44
Thank god this johoe chap swept the bitcoins before someone else did. I am appalled that an entity as big in the bitcoin industry as blockchain.info is, would allow a non crypto random source to be used for key generation....especially as they have been doing this stuff for years, would have witnessed the same thing happening with the Android wallet. It's just not on and realistically I think this is a big wakeup call for people as to why YOU should be in control of your own private keys. I recognize that it can be a bit hard to ensure that software the average user uses is using a crypto random source of entropy, however I think it should become standard for all vendors of private keys to clearly specify exactly their source of entropy and if they intend to change it they should list it in the update notes of software etc. people time to take back your keys.
@_date: 2014-12-22 09:28:01
No you are NOT RITE. R values are derived from private keys in turn derived from sh!t box not crypto random entropy. Given the R value goes on the blockchain for all to see and the encrypted wallet does not, I would much prefer a user reuse a crap password to encrypt a local wallet then them use shitty private keys.

Heya, this C# API will do exactly that for you, Type the string into the String field of the Demo GUI and It creates both WIF and WIF (compressed Pub Key) so both Bitcoin addresses for the one brain wallet sentence. Enjoy :)

"Unless you are using a Trezor. Than the password does not matter." &lt;- WRONG!!!!! (Or do you mean to say password only matters if you are using a Trezor?)
Trezor creates the 12 - 24 word phrase and it USES THE PASSWORD in a 2048 pass PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 to generate the root seed which all your future private keys are based off. With only the phrase and not the password...you are royally fooked. So again bollocks, password does matter. Here is the BIP39 spec Trezor (And BTW MultiBit HD) uses: 
@_date: 2014-12-22 09:07:24
Yah, SSLstrip, it can also divert ya traffic to a bollocks SSL site. To be sure just always check the site is SSL secured and check certificate  make sure it is issued to the correct domain i.e blockchain.info and be super alert for bollocks spellings like bl0ckchain.info etc. If you're mad paranoid you can write down the SHA thumbprint of the certificate and essentially do manual certificate pinning by only using the site when the SHA thumbprint of the cert matches what's expected, but that's overkill usually.

24 word mnemonic sentence saved in a txt file then in turn that file is save in an AES256 bit encrypted .7z or TrueCrypt container. Oh and the seed bytes derived from the mnemonic sentence sealed with a passphrase so even if they get the sentence, without the passphrase (hmac key) the can't derive the seed bytes used to generate private keys :D
@_date: 2014-12-22 09:39:23
Oh I see, the superfluous "Than" threw me off. That sentence should really be written as  "If you are not using a Trezor then the password doesn't matter".
Agreed, seems Electrum will rebuild your seed bytes from just the phrase and the password just protects wallet locally.

LOL. Fantastic post tho!
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:42:07
That's what I thought. However really SSSS has nothing at all to do with multisig because Multisig is NOT splitting anything up into pieces. It has one big redeemScript that is hashed and it requires m of n signatures from related pubKeys in the redeemScript, but no pieces are created just signatures and signatures just allow the redeemScript to be valid. It has absolutely nothing to do with SSSS.
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:13:28
Nah, the BTC community is too cluey for that. I think you'll find it's more to do with all the investor news pegging BTC as the worst investment of 2014 so you're starting to see the pulling out of mum and dad investors I reckon.
@_date: 2015-05-03 04:46:18
So you're saying one person is performing Shamir to their own Private Key BEFORE participating in a multisig transaction? So the multisig transaction has nothing to do with SSSS in any way right?
@_date: 2015-01-10 11:30:27
That is true, but you can do it through an independent buy/sell trader, set your buy order and you get 30 minutes to walk into the bank with cash and buy the bitcoin onto an address that you control. Then when sell you give the bitcoin you control to the trader and once block height is up enough you get your money.

Sucks to be Bitstamp about now!
@_date: 2015-01-10 04:24:32
Of course the stored keys (or root seed used to derive keys) needs to be encrypted, but that's as simple as a passphrase and any good wallet will encourage you to encrypt your private keys! I can't see how creating a password for a wallet locally or creating a password for an online account constitutes an ease of use tradeoff?
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:55:43
Yah, the fact that it hit Bitstamp really goes to show it can happen to anyone. If you don't mind me asking, what was your choice of Hardware wallet? A Trezor?
@_date: 2015-05-03 13:26:21
Which is what i thought, so when they mention it in Multisig transactions it really has no place being mentioned there!
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:37:53
I understand the technical difference between the ECDSA keypair vs multisig using a few private keys from a few ECDSA keypairs to provide signatures. But if the math related to Threshold Signatures is SSSS, then Threshold signature is used in a normal P2PKH transaction with a single publicKey (not multisig) therefore to say it is used in multisig is superfluous as it is used in all transactions in this case which I simply do not believe to be true!
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:57:18
Yea their site says they have no bitcoins left to sell. I suspect they bought a heap of Bitcoins when they were expensive and now the price has dropped they don't want to part with the Bitcoins. They most likely are robbing you to try recoup losses.
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:50:36
Because the banks can reverse digital fiat transfers and they offer guarantee of pilfered funds and in some cases protected by the Government to do as much. Cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reversed therefore there is a nil chance of fund recovery by the specialist company and zero protection by the government. That is why.
Fiat specialist companies have government enforced regulations they need to adhere to, which protect you from thing like theft. Crypto currency specialist company does not.
You cannot compare a centralised, regulated and officially sanctioned currency with crypto currency (in most countries) AT THE MOMENT.

@_date: 2015-05-03 05:22:28
That's what I was thinking. So the wikki entry here  suggesting multisignature transactions can be done with SSSS is wrong!
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:31:26
@_date: 2015-01-10 08:09:00
What do you mean the base level? Fiat transactions are not locked in a blockchain, unless you hold physical cash in hand, the transaction can be reverted and made to have never existed by a bank operating under financial regulations. This is the reason ATMs only issue a certain amount of money to you each day, and if you want to withdraw a large amount of money from the bank you need to provide ID etc, so that the financial institutions can ensure things are legit.
Bitcoin agents can create agreements but what good is it when someone sends all a bitcoin agents bitcoin to a private key/s they have control of? No agreement between agents can get it back, unless they fork the blockchain and unlike cash which is restricted as to how much can be withdrawn daily, there is none of this sort of protection in Bitcoin by design.
Trying to compare the two is Apples and Oranges, submitting control of your finances to an entity that can (and as we see more than once now, does!) loose it, and no amount of regulating or government can get it back is just plain retarded realistically. You wouldn't do that......well not if you value your coins. But by all means, keep your coins online, you loose the right to complain when they get taken :p

Are you sure? If that's true, what you are saying is that ECDSA (when signing a transaction is providing a threshold signature) is built upon SSSS? In which case ALL transactions would be using SSSS not just multisig. I don't think this is true!

Easy. Use 2FA such that only one device can vote. Ok some
People might have more then one device but only allow each registered voter to use one device, push a 2FA code to that device, job done. Oh and that vote goes on the blockchain without PII so the vote is there but no link to who made the vote. Totally doable.

Fees have nothing to do with security against attack. Fees have everything to do with priority and the chance that your transaction will  occupy space in a block.
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:44:33
None of these answers are particularly great. For one the idea that a big miner reward stops the miner double spending against you is completely wrong. The other answer that we'll be dead well that's not what I'm asking. The first answer saying transactions will probably cost about $7 is the closes t thing to an answer but still nbot much of an answer.
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:48:38


Kinda Correct, it would only allow them to alter their transactions by forking the blockchain to revert their transactions and return their bitcoin to them for a double spend. However they could also do things like drop other peoples transactions off the blockchain thus allowing other people to double spend those funds. It would play havoc but it's not in a miners interest to do this, but the big double spend could be beneficial to them, but I imagine anything that big would be wanting lots and lots of confirmations such that even having 51% of hashing power wouldn't undo.
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:50:59


Yes but they can make Bitcoin payed to you disapear if they fork the blockchain such that the transactions to you no longer appear in the forked blockchain generated with the 51% hashing power.

I heard Satoshi Nakamoto drives a Toyota and eats seaweed rolls.
@_date: 2015-04-18 01:56:00
Ah gotcha! So using P2SH any party can collect pubkeys from N entities and create the redeem script, then provide the 3xxxxx address (Hashed, encoded redeemScript) to the N entities and then bitcoin is payed to the 3xxxxx address by any entity or the input defined in the redeemScript if the op codes lock inputs is this correct? And does this mean the party generating the redeem script needs to take note of it's size and include any fees in the transaction? I'm assuming they would have to yea? thanks heaps :)
@_date: 2015-04-18 04:05:54
I think I have the idea behind migrating to P2SH down pat, the idea is that the redeem script can be created then hash encoded by anyone with all the public keys and then people pay bitcoin to the created address and then anyone wanting to spend the bitcoin has to have a copy of that redeem script and enough signatures to spend it right? So the redeem script need only be passed around before spending where as I think what you're saying is previously the initial transaction to the multisig address contained the script in pubkeyscript instead, so all signatures were added to that transaction which was already on the chain containing the script is that correct?
@_date: 2015-04-18 11:44:18
Yep yep awesome got it. Thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:24:19
Roger that. So M out of N signatures will be required to be on the transaction before it is seen by peers and processed into the blockchain. Thanks!

Right, but the threat here is Craig Wright not the NSA. So to say that faking hotel wifi is not reasonable is an invalid statement as it is very simple and easy to do. To go to the level of using something like a Stingray to intercept/alter cellular data is a capability that the NSA have, not Dr Craig Wrong so it would be far more plausible to assume the cellular is safe then the wifi given the wifi can be spoofed for $30 and cellular takes a lot more money.

Yes he could be fooled, but he wouldn't know he was being fooled if he was convinced beyond any doubt. To say that I have no doubt this is Satoshi, and then say actually there is some doubt I could have been tricked, it's a definite contradiction if they are both put out as separate statements. he could say at the time I had no doubt, but now there is some doubt that would be fine. But to put out two contradicting statements then go dark with no clarification, inexcusable.

The same RSA that's in X.509 certs is used in PGP. You can actually Pick the algorithm/s you want to use in PGP so RSA,DSA,ECDSA etc and OpenSSL is the same you can choose the algorithm/s that you communicate over the net with. I say algorithm/S because in PGP you can have sub keys so it's possible to say specify RSA for encryption and have a sub key that is ECDSA for signatures all bundled in the one public key block.

well svbtle are using a cert issued by Go Daddy so I'm guessing it's not a cert supplied/issued by them. Looks like good ol' Chase Dittmer is hosting his blog with his cert from let's encrypt on the same server as Gavin and so https requests are using his cert by default. Gavin probably hasn't set up a cert on his blog I'd say. I don't think this is an error on the part of Gavin.

Yea bit if the trust that he can't access is legit he might not have access to the 1 mil Bitcoin. I'm just saying if he is Satoshi and his story about the Bitcoin and trust were real. Of course he is not Satoshi, the time is up for him to prove it. Even if now he moved early coin it has been suspiciously long time he could have bought early key etc. He has shot himself in foot with false proof.

Yea true, I agree with that. It is definitely hard to speak up from the crowd. I just thought that Satoshi would have had a more personal visit with Gavin given their previous history, at least met up had a beer or whatever. To lump everyone in a room and then shoo them off seems disrespectful.

Fact: Nerds are socially awkward and don't like making demands. Gavin probably didn't want to make demands because it comes across (in his mind) as being rude and he could be perceived as not trusting Satoshi. Although I feel that the real Satoshi would have commended Gavin for making demands. The real Satoshi wants the trust in people to be removed and Gavin has (unfortunately for him) shown us all exactly why Satoshi wants the human trust removed. The real Satoshi would have made sure Gavin left with MATHEMATICALLY PROVABLE PROOF. Gavin is a nerd, and so I can understand how someone like Craig Wright can put it over him. Makes me get in a red hot rage tho.

Your rule 1 of crypto is not quite correct. The one time pad is provably not breakable. However it doesn't scale well as it requires a random key as big as the plaintext itself which is XOR'd with the plaintext.
Asymmetric crypto is where the danger lies most, for e.g. RSA relies on the fact that we can't generate big prime numbers fast enough to crack it. ECDSA is using points on a curve and again it uses the fact that we can't generate the coordinates quick enough for security. Quantum computing is a threat to current Asymmetric algorithms mostly. So yes Quantum computing is a threat to ECDSA, the basis of Bitcoin. As mentioned I think SHA256 is quite safe itself however if Quantum computer can go through the entire input space fast enough it becomes unsafe. I guess it really depends on the computing power throughput of Quantum computers. All this stuff about the sun will burn out before we ever get the computing power to break 256bit keys I do not believe that nonsense. Todays Science fiction is tomorrows science fact and you always should keep the threat of the crypto breaking in your mind.

Why is he being so vague? Why would he stand and support the fact that CW is Satoshi yet have nothing but a very vague story to support what he says? If all we have is speculation it's because Gavin has left us with no proof and a lot of speculation. Gavin himself is speculating, and making a statement based on his speculation then saying "i could have been bamboozled"....well fuck Gavin, did you prove it or were you bamboozled? Which was it? Completely inappropriate to make that claim then sit on the fence after the fact.
If Gavin didn't eliminate the variables that could allow him to be 'bamboozled' then Gavin cannot stand up and say without a doubt he is Satoshi. That is just not possible.

Nup, the only thing that has happened to P2PKH addresses is they went from a full pubKey to a compressed pubKey format. No change to the underlying crypto either, still secp256k1 ECDSA stuff. I believe any form of quantum resilient crypto would be too slow/large on current computational power devices. I'm sure when the time comes it won't be hard to drop in a new quantum safe algo fir signatures, but there will be a delay and people may loose funds.
@_date: 2016-05-08 05:04:57
Simple way to confirm is to go to the debug window and look at your peers. If each of the peers are reporting a different IP address in the "via" field then you know each peer is on a Tor circuit. Also look for the peers connected via .onion hidden services, you will get them too. I run my full node core client through Tor. ���� The downside is you can't allow connections in when you are explicitly tor only, so if you want to go the Tor only path you are still contributing as you relay through the 8 peers you are connect too but you do not allow anyone to connect to you on port 8333 is the trade off.  So you're not as friendly for SPV wallets etc.

@_date: 2015-02-09 10:34:28
The thing with that tho is it combats MitM over the wire, as soon as the PC is compromised you have to assume the private key in the cert which is used for signing can be hijacked and used to sign bogus transactions. We can mitigate this by requiring an auth token signed from a 3rd party in the cloud and the public key related to the key in the cloud could be stored in the TREZOR and the auth token could have a signature which could be verified by the pubkey on the TREZOR. This would mean that even the most vulnerable of PCs cannot alter what goes to the TREZOR because the auth to do so must come from the cloud. But currently I don't believe TREZOR is doing this, if they are, they are not mentioning as much that I can see. OR of coures, multi-sig transactions with one signature required from a 3rd party cloud provider, this would also cover it I think yes? Does TREZOR support M of N transactions?

To be in a trust type setup the outputs would have to be multisig with all members of the trust to supply signatures. Old coinbase is 100% not multisig so there is no trust provision stopping them being spent, at least not from a cryptographic perspective, perhaps legal?

Genesis block is first block ever created on the Bitcoin blockchain and it was made by Satoshi or someone authorised by Satoshi. Inside the genesis block is 50 bitcoin which were made as reward fir creating the block, this 50 bitcoin reward is known as coinbase. The output script for coinbase requires a related private to supply a signature to prove ownership of that coinbase and spend the 50 bitcoin. Genesis block coinbase cannot be spent due to the bitcoin code however, and it is unclear if that was by design or a coding error. Anywho, basically instead of signing the output script to spend the coinbase, someone can use the private key to sign a message of anyones choosing. So in this example if CW used the private key to sign a message that says "I am Satoshi" then you can be confident that CW has, or knows somebody who has the private key related to the coinbase in that genesis block.

I wouldn't say it's vast at all. For example people say brute-forcing a private key is impossible because you have a like a all but no percent chance. I guess the context does enter into it in some scenarios but the fact remains in this case that two statements that cannot coexist have been mede. He's said he is certain he ate McDonalds in one story, then in another story he said he may actually have ate KFC. It can only be one, he certainly ate McDonalds or  he perhaps ate KFC. He cannot claim to certainly eat McDonalds and possibly eat KFC at the same time (assuming there can only be one choice). So in this path given that Craig can only be Satoshi, or not be Satoshi, and cannot be both, he cant say Beyond any reasonable doubt Craig is Satoshi, then say There is some doubt and he might not be Satoshi. Those two statements cannot coexist you have to pick one and follow it to the outcome.

Bollocks, it doesn't even have to be an exploit for TREZOR, it can be an Adobe exploit or whatever that pushes data into the TREZOR memory for display by the TREZOR interface. People have managed to breach ASLR and do things like Heap Spray even if ASLR is in effect to try get on target, this is not science fiction. You cannot discredit that the attack could be done, you simply cannot. If you can gain complete control of a vulnerable PC including access to all it's memory, what I say is not impossible. Given we find big security vulnerabilities often that achieve such access, it is not unrealistic.

Don't tell Gavin Andresen whatever you do! He is still patting himself on the back for meeting Satoshi!
FYI if you look at Dr (lol) Wright's latest blog, he provides a tutorial on how to create Bitcoin addresses....thanks....but the reason I say this is because he points to bitcoinsharp as being a great C# library for making Bitcoin addresses.... It isn't... bitcoinsharp is obsolete and it creates OLD UNCOMPRESSED PUBKEY ADDRESSES so he is recommending you use a C# library that creates old style addresses and bloats the blockchain and makes transactions larger? Doesn't seem very satoshi like. Thashiznets on github actually updated the bitcoinsharp code to do compressed pubkey addresses and I'd find it likely that Nicolas Dorier did in his NBitcoin implementation as well. Anyone with half a brain would suggest NBitcoin over bitcoinsharp as the C# method for address creation so not much research went into that blog post which s supposed to be helping us do something so trivial...

Believe it or not, the same malware that records the password for your encrypted wallet can easily be made to liaise with a TREZOR or whatever hardware wallet once plugged in.
All you are doing with a hardware wallet is essentially the same thing as storing the keys on an offline computer.....as soon as you plug your hardware wallet into an online device you bring the keys online and it becomes fair game for malware to do MitM etc. So I'd suggest the future is more around educating users about good internet security practices then anything.

Using BIP39 to create a 12 - 24 word phrase, then BIP32 to create a HD wallet etc so wallet can be rubuilt, maximum ease of use. Then, for security we can use multi-sig transactions and our cloud API can also provide one signature in the m of n for extra security :)

@_date: 2015-02-09 05:40:37
I understand how offline signing works, I spoke about how the Transaction would be formed and sent to the TREZOR for signing. What part of what I said is incorrect? The only thing you're saying is that it shows on the screen, so your whole argument is that the user will definitely notice it's going to a different address. Well what if the machine has been churning away creating key pairs and sending the privkey to me and storing the address on the machine, then it picks a similar looking address to inject into the transaction to try and trick the user, you know one with the same like first 3 characters or something. It's easy to say people won't be fooled.....then these people open up emails that say you have won 5 million dollars and infect their machine.
I'm not being ignorant, you are just assuming that everyone scrutinises all their hardware wallet transactions on device instead of what's on the screen in front of them. I wouldn't make that assumption, I'd be willing to bet there are plenty who just push the go button.

yea I don't like that at all, I think keys encrypted or otherwise have no place in the cloud, BIP39 combined with BIP32 and forcing the user to remember the 12 - 24 words is truly the way to go I reckon. Oh with the exception of one key stashed in the cloud on behalf of the client to authenticate multi-sig transactions, but it can't be allowed to be used to transact on it's own.

Yea I see what you are saying, i.e if the cloud nodes get pulled the client becomes inoperable, but I feel that by using standards like BIP39, BIP32 and there are other standalone SPV clients out there that would regenerate keys from mnemonic sentence, this would mitigate the risk. I think.

At what point did I say the TREZOR was insecure? I'm saying it has attack vectors and not necessarilly the holy grail ignorant people like yourself would believe it to be :)
And yes, I mentioned nothing about changing anything on TREZOR, I mentioned only manipulating what is going into the TREZOR and what is shown on PC.
Indeed people are insecure, which is why I stand by my original comment of making people more secure when it comes to things internet. Get them scruitinising SSL certs and cross checking the domain etc. Educating them, this is exactly what I was saying and you are confirming that.....

There is always some kind of centralisation, whether it be the wallet software creator or the cloud. If keys are stored locally and can be moved from wallet to wallet, I don't see the cloud as creating more centralisation, it's just an extension of your choice of wallet software.
@_date: 2015-02-09 03:33:24
You dont? You manipulate the transaction as it is being sent to the TREZOR for signing. Remember, a Transaction is maleable until it is signed, so if you control what is going into the TREZOR to be signed you, ultimately create your own transactions. Then if you can control what is displayed in the user interface to look like they are sending to where they intend, instead sending to the address you swapped in. I'm not saying it's being done, I'm saying it's hard to discredit that it can be done.
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:57:14
Yea I see what you're saying, I just think of people in sketchy network areas where 27MB of data is a lot! I think given what you've shown me SPV is great, but I think if we can create super thin clients that don't even need to obtain block headers then that will be a benefit.
I'm trying to think of ease of use, I have a friend that lives in a rural location where he relies on mobile broadband and 27mb takes a while to download. This would frustrate a user if they have to dl the headers the first time and their connection sucks and may be off putting. Thus by doing all this in the cloud I'd suggest that we are creating a more dl and go approach for the user with a reduction of setup stuffs.
@_date: 2016-07-10 01:29:41
That looks awesome!
@_date: 2015-02-09 05:35:41
I already said there is no extraction of the keys from the TREZOR. You might see it? Some people don't see faceb00k.com in bogus SSL certs and blindly type in the password. If you perhaps have been pre making addresses on the malware infected machine, what's to say you can't pick a similar looking address from the pool of pre made addresses to try and trick the user? That TREZOR screen is tiny.
"The Trezor is designed to only accept certain types of data" says who? How do you know what it accepts? I'd say it accepts the parameters necessary to form a transaction ready for signing would you not? So if one can alter the parameters before they get to the TREZOR then they can steal the funds. And all the people like you who think the TREZOR is fully safe just keep blindly pressing the button sending their funds away :)
Remember, you need to use the computer/android device to use the TREZOR, it will not transact on it's own. Again, if you control what goes into the TREZOR and can manipulate what is seen on PC/Phone, there is a fair chance at stealing funds. You cannot say otherwise.
@_date: 2016-07-10 01:40:53
I thought transactions had to be formed in a merkel tree and the Merkel root stored in the block header before hashing and finding a block? This would mean you can't add transactions after the fact as the merkel root is in the header

I believe signatures can be software dependent, off memory a signature in MultiBit does not verify with a signature from Bitcoin Core etc. So it makes sense to use the same software that did the signature for verification to be certain.

I was under the impression that the Android wallet did and users got upset about all the data coming over the mobile network to dl the block chain, I thought this forced the birth of SPV which is now implemented in the Android Wallet, Bread Wallet, Electrum etc?
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:12:38
Yes. Just like BIP70 which it is an extension of. I don't understand why AA and Peter Todd are getting their knickers in a knot over it!
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:43:23
Hmmm interesting. Ok yep so straight away by using the cloud we can remove the requirement to download 27MB worth of headers.
Yea I can see what you mean about the privacy because the cloud can log your IP each transaction, so perhaps the inclusion of using P2P purely to route transactions so the API never sees your true IP?
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:20:04
I agree, but with &gt;20gb block chain it's just becoming un viable for mobile devices, which is why they implemented SPV to allow verification without needing the whole chain but I'm saying do all SPV in the cloud. Nothing block chain related should go to the client, no headers, no merkle roots do it all in the cloud. But I do see what you're saying because if clients stop doing SPV you become reliant on the cloud nodes and you loose that P2P swarm of verification.
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:15:53
Yes very similar, except why is Electrum not on mobile devices? Also add with the removal of SPV by the client. Use the cloud to do any SPV and make sure the connection between the client and the cloud is trusted.
Oh wait I see Electrum is on Android. That's pretty good.

Just as I can choose to throw my vote away, I can choose to sell it if I want. I only get one vote and if I sell it so be it, selling my vote is my vote, my vote is that I don't care and I'll accept $x and allow the buyer to make the vote, that in itself is a vote, I have voted to take the money and accept the consequence. Someone could pay me to vote a certain way at the booths now so it makes no difference. Also right now I can go around to a heap of different polling booths and cast a vote. They simply ask "have you voted today" yet they do not have a way (currently) to check if I have voted. By using a public blockchain they could do this. Also right now someone can take my identity, walk into a poling booth and vote as me (provided I have not already voted at that polling booth). Very easily. All too easy. So yes I do dismiss it as extremely easy, especially given how easy it is to "game" the current system. Of course I pre voted for the flux party today. Maybe I'll head into my electorate tomorrow and do my bit and pump out a few votes at 10 different polling booths all for the flux party. I know it won't matter because the choice is always the giant douche or the turd sandwich, but it at least proves a point.

How is it not true? The software the interfaces with TREZOR sends transactions to the TREZOR to be signed, how can you say with 100% assurity that malware can't send it's own transactions to be signed by the TREZOR, and alter what is seen in the software interface by the user? Sure keys may be safely stashed in the TREZOR, but it doesn't stop you manipulating the software running on the machine to instruct the TREZOR to do bad things ;P Even if say there is an SSL link to the TREZOR, you have to assume the private key can be read from memory on the compromised computer etc. Sticking a TREZOR into a compromized computer will not save you from TREZOR TARGETED attacks. Feel free to enlighten me otherwise if you have a better understanding of how TREZOR works, instead of just telling me to understand it.

Also factor in the possibillity of a pool in another location, I for instance have a DB sitting in Azure with 463,225,944 pre made keys (growing by the second) and I'm not generating them as quick as I could be because for each made key I am firing out a web request to something like blockr and checking for a BTC balance.....just for sh!ts and giggles. But a premade pool in the cloud is not terribly unviable and if you can do a quick enough http request to poll the DB and get a similar key back this could well be viable.
Yes it's shy of the 56 billion by lots however I'm confident if I wasn't doing the http requests my generation time would probably decrease in the order of 10 - 100x quicker I reckon and that took me no more than 3 months to make those addresses at the current slow rate. I think it is quite viable to hit the quoted amound in a cloud DB and poll it, just hopefully you can trap and hold onto the transaction before it goes to the TREZOR for long enough for the http request and DB lookup to complete. My DB sucks to poll, but I'm sure it could be optimised to be faster, when I bump it up to a P3 premium grade DB it goes lots better.
It's not a concern if you are vigillant and look at the whole address, so intelligent people will do that, but there are so many dumbarses out there that you could pull this trick off with me thinks.
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:04:45
Correct. It gives the merchant an extra degree of certainty that they are dealing with Bob not Alice, with the added benefit of two way encryption.
Also, any exchange that verifies your identification for the purpose of KYC you'd assume they're recording this anyway. Nothing stops them from doing what BIP75 proposes now within their own platform. it's about an industry standard to make it easier for devs to see how things should be done, and if any flaws are found the BIP is able to be revised and devs can act accordingly.
Anyone screaming AML-CTF KYC blah blah is just a parrot.
I only just looked at this now, but from the way people were carrying on I though that there was an identifying fingerprint following transactions around or something!!!! This is nothing more than a website sticking a cookie in your browser and making sure you have that cookie when you do anything on the site! In fact realistically you could abstract  BIP75 out of the Bitcoin protocol altogether, it's kind of an external added nicety as is BIP70.

Yes I believe this is bloom filtering, but I also believe that the full block needs to be downloaded for verification. So I *think* what happens is they maintain block headers and if they need to verify a transaction on a particular block they download the block. Is that right?

The crypto being broken would not surprise me, it would be horrible but if Quantum computing does arrive and we can compute operations quick enough it is entirely plausible that the crypto can be broken until it is shifted to something quantum proof. That's why things like RSA that rely on the fact we can't generate huge prime numbers fast enough scare me, it is inevitable that RSA will be broken in the future. Scary stuff. But symmetric stuff in particular the one time pad which is pretty much just XOR with a random key as long as the data is safe from such attacks.
@_date: 2016-07-01 10:02:45
If you actually read the BIP....... It's just a way Merchants can enforce some kind of relationship only with customers they know by pre-issuing customers a cert and expecting signatures from that cert before issuing payment addresses. It actually changes nothing to the underlying protocol, Bitcoin transactions do not change. I actually thought given all the fuss that they were writing a fingerprint payload in transaction data, that's how most of you carry on like. This is nothing. I just assume anyone who performs KYC would be recording what I do anyway..... ok so they add the extra step of requiring a cert.... cert can be stolen just sayin'.  I think good on 'em for this, makes an industry standard available for a very genuine use case.

@_date: 2015-02-09 03:23:25
Holy shit. I don't think you have any idea how it works! Given that the TREZOR plugs into a computer.....But feel free to enlighten me!
Yep sure I do, the TREZOR stores your keys, but you plug the TREZOR into the computer and there is software that interfaces with the TREZOR sending it transactions which are signed on your TREZOR using the keys stored in your TREZOR. How is it not possible that malware COULD POTENTIALLY hijack the transactions going to the TREZOR for signing? Sure your keys might not be able to be extracted, but if you manipulate the transactions to send to malicious address and spoof what is displayed by the software to the user, why is that not possible? Perhaps instead of carrying on like a muppet, explain to me why it's not possible?

Yep, coinbase transaction forms merkle root if no ther transactions. If a miner wanted they could just mine Coinbase only blocks to keep the block size down thus increase chance of propagation. This is one reason why increasing block size (at the moment) is the wrong direction to take.
