'Satoshi' is probaby a group of people, not 1 guy.

Bitcoin has no real value behind it tbh. I'd choose 1 BTC worth of gold instead of 1 bitcoin.

Pawn shops? lol. Go to the big guys like APMEX for .9999 gold coins/bars. Also stock market exists for selling.

I honestly don't know how people don't see its a bubble. It has no physical value behind it, gold has a physical manifestation, bitcoin is just worthless code backed by nothing. Its a huge gamble, and most people won't jump ship until the bubble bursts, but it will be too late. + there is the threat of govs fucking with bitcoin legislation.

Digital things can be valuable, I don't doubt that. Like how companies datamine social networks, which is invaluable for marketing for example, or digital money, which is backed by a countries economy,  or items in online games, etc. The problem is btc is not backed by anything at all, but the belief in it constant rise. People don't want to miss out and they jump in. Until the bubble bursts. Its still a good way to make money, if you cash out in time.
Many people here say *'but I have 15 btc from 2013, now I made tens of thousands!'* But they didn't make anything until you cash out.

No. I said worthless code, because it is backed by nothing at all. The digital things you listed are valuable, because they have a book/game/whatever behind it. But btc has nothing.


Lol what? Ever heard of bank transfers? And its not the only one.

I dont trust if because it is pure speculation (thus extremely  volatile).
Also it is a huge energy waste to mine some crypto that has no real value behind it.

Its a gigantic energy waste to mine btc, it is not going ot be viable for a longer period of time.

This thread did not age well :D
I knew time would prove me. I personally expect it to fall down to 3k by mid 2018, and eventually it will fall towards to oblivion, and will be known as tulip mania 2.0 One tip: don't be a hodler. Its [sunken time fallacy]( and its an extremely bad mindset if you jump into volatile/speculative markets such as btc and other cryptos. Cash out while its worth something.
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:03:40
And people here laughed at me here when I said bitcoin is tulip mania 2.0
Mark my words, bitcoin is gonna crash down to 3k or even lower by mid 2018. But I guess at least the smart people cashed out when it was 15k+, while the idiot hodlers cling to a bubble.
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:42:33
Ill keep that in mind when it crashes down to 3k and below.
Hodlers are nothing more than people with the [sunk cost fallacy.](
This mindset is the ultimate enemy (and also the downfall) of people who jump into extremely volatile/speculative markets/investments, such as bitcoin and other cryptos.
