See that bitcoin tip above?  That is why. Bitcoin allows you to do so much more than a proprietary system can achieve. That is why people compare it to the internet, anyone can build it into any project/idea/whatever. Does veronica wanna tip her friends on twitter? Or buy porn/shoes without her spouse knowing? Or you name it, it will be included in everything and things we haven't even thought of.  Sure she can keep her fiat, pay bank fees, and lose it to inflation, but bitcoin is just better money.
In the future, child veronica will be able to text her mom asking for 5 ubtc to go to the movies and veronica will get the money in seconds, multisig with the movie theater so she can only spend it there.

Unlike PayPal, Bitcoin is open ecosystem. You can choose coinbase bitpay or any other service you wish or none at all.   Credit cards are not a good way to transact online. You give up all your info and let them "pull"  the correct amount (hopefully).  This has many security concerns as well as higher fees.

Thank you for your comment, Gavin. 
I have one question though, you are paid by the bitcoin foundation for your time as the lead developer.  Something you can not be forever, do you picture the future of your position always being paid by a foundation(s)? Do you think this could lead to monetary incentive for that programmer to include something that could benefit certain foundation members in an unfair way? I assume nothing, and would just like your input.
 Thanks for everything Gavin.

Which is just an opportunity for a business to provided insured banking services for those who need it in the bitcoin space. I see no problem with either/or or both cases.  Bitcoin is a very new and still high risk, if is obvious you should do your homework and it is still far from mainstream use cases. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:36:18
Just buy a reasonable amount for you situation.  Then wait until at least 2020.  If you wanna try to day trade,  set aside only 10% to do that with and keep the main stash away from an exchange.
If you wanna spend your BTC, just rebuy at the same time to keep total btc balance the same.  
Remember to look at all the metrics not just price.  As long as bitcoin is still growing then price is not an issue. It will boom and bust as its done since it started.

@_date: 2014-03-19 19:49:23
You have it backwards. Its not about laws, its about morality. Nobody should be put in hierarchy above you. Giving people power corrupts them, and when you mix the power to print money (indebt the future) and people in power you get corrupt goverment. War, theft (taxation), and slavery (economic or otherwise) is all morally wrong.  Freeing the people and the markets will produce an expansion in technology and growth. It is like getting rid of slavery of blacks, sure it hurt the farmers short term, but it was morally right and innovation and technology helped the farmers overcome their reliance on slaves.

I always imagine the first Autonomous Corporation to be a self driving car like the google car, that is a taxi service.  You could open your app on your phone that found the best closest one/price ratio for your situation because these cars would be bidding against each other for pickups.  You would have to pay with bitcoin for the door to open. 
Once inside it automatically takes you to destination, it will have a computer inside for alterations.  The taxi will be completely autonomous, paying for its own fuel, repair, etc, all profits made could go to expanding, buying new or more cars, or even directly to Charity. All done with bitcoin.
Bitcoin opens up so many possibilities, the fact anyone can add the abilities of a bank plus way more into any computer is going to change many things.

This has been discussed many times. The energy is not wasted it is used to secure the network and process transactions. There is also no way to use energy for scientific research because any algorithm that can be "pre-mined" would be insecure. Sorry that is as basic as I can make it, but please do more research.
PoS is inherently insecure and not a viable solution. Ideas like proof of idle seem compelling but more research and testing must be done.

I am talking about government in general not just US government.  I live in the United States, but I see all government as unnecessary and suppressive to our rights as humans. 
The concept of "voluntary" government does not exist today. For example, If I want to live in my home in the United States, I am coerced into paying my taxes and following unjust non victim crime laws. It is similar to a Mafia. If you own a business and the mafia comes to you for "protection" you must pay or bad things will happen to you and your business.  The government is just a larger mafia with more branches and arms into all aspects of life.  Anytime you are coerced into doing something, and it is not voluntary it is not moral. 
Prostitution is just another victimless crime. If it is voluntary on both sides it is not a problem. The difference between porn and prostitution is a camera.  Why that woman chose or ended up in that lifestyle should independent of government interaction.
U.S. prisons especially federal prisons will shoot if you are escaping, they automatically see you as threat to society if you escape and will use whatever force necessary. U.S. Marshals when transporting criminals make this very clear.  U.S. has more people in prison than any other nation and is the worst offender at imprisonment when no victim is involved. 
I believe the government is too big to change now. Governments only grow and get bigger in influence. We must now try to change society from within. The easiest thing to do is raise your kids free of violence and aggression. Hopefully we can raise a generation who will not be coerced by the government and the debt they hold even before they are born.

B. Bitcoin gives you a sliding scale of anonymity.  You can be transparent, how we want banks, goverment, charities etc, or you make bitcoin as anonymous as you want so people for example can't see how much you make per year.

This isn't really that big of deal for the future. Eventually the transaction fees will negate any very very small advantage you get by including less transactions in the block. There has been blocks with 0 transactions included.  
This really isnt something to freak out about. Look BTC guild just included 1687 transactions.

Building  on your MMO idea. Ive had a few ideas about a MMORPG that was based on bitcoin. You had subscription fees in bitcoin that were then seeded into the game through drops/quests/whatever, and had a auction house that also used bitcoin. A real free market MMO. You could sell items for bitcoin that you can use at anyplace that accepts bitcoin. Picking up a few hundred satoshis by killing a boss. Or finding an epic loot worth so much you could pay your bills. Provide services in game for bitcoin, If you provide a service you are meeting a demand and it wont matter if its real world or digital. Money is money.

This was a JOKE, are you entitled to be over sensitive or you can you realize you can't stop it?

Get rid of hierarchical society. The constitution was first step, right after we became a free nation from England we experienced the largest economical boom (industrial revolution) and that was when our government was the smallest. The founding fathers tried to protect us with representational government but it has failed, government has grown and grown with corruption down to its core. 
I think the non-agression principle should apply to our lives as well as the state's actions. They apply force when it is not moral to do so.  Do I have all the answers? No, but government is not the right direction.

That is chicken or egg situation though. Without the vendors accepting bitcoin there won't be adoption. They add value to the ecosystem even if instantly converting to fiat.

Actually bitcoin isn't really mined like gold. Thats a common misconception.  Bitcoins are mined at a set schedule and halving the amount produced at given intervals until all bitcoins are mined.  A gold vein could be found tomorrow or a meteor filled with gold could hit earth tomorrow changing supply. So one is certain and the other is only somewhat certain of the supply.

Bitcoin is an amazing technology and will no doubt add wealth to the world.  Poor countries will have access to financial instruments not available in their countries and give them a real free market to do business. This is worldwide and will facilitate trade never seen before.

WTF guys? Its not propaganda if its true, its activism. Wtf is with all these fuckheads coming into the and spreading this bullshit about how cringey and preachy it is to talk to people about bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a tool and a great technology but it is all about social cues. If someone is interested why not talk about the future benefits and values. Much like the internet, and how it was labeled fringe and geeky at first, it will have huge implications if sucessful.  If they aren't interested, you then don't try to convince someone to buy it like some used car salesman.
If you ask if somewhere takes bitcoin it is the fucking same as asking if someone takes credit or debit. Not fucking cringey or preachy at all.

OH don't be alarmed with the whole tracking money bullshit. We want bitcoin to succeed because it is open and allows for a full slider of anonymity with technology at the edges. We have tor and pgp and proxies for the internet, we will have other software at the edges such as darkwallets, tumblers, mixing services, shit we haven't thought up. We can keep public institutions and charities whatever public and keep our private lives private. We just need to make sure there is always fungibility in the fundamental bitcoin protocol level.  It will actually allow us to have greater freedom with our money, while making everyone play by the same rules. 
Also if bitcoin doesn't succeed make no mistake about it, another digital currency could and I doubt it will not include even more harmful privacy concerns. Most likely that currency will be gov or corporate backed and not decentralized.

Safer to pay with visa?  Yes, give the merchant all your information and trust they pull the right amount. Not to mention identity theft issues.

Exactly the same reason I don't worry about the price. Bitcoin has the market cap of peanuts, but its potential in remittance, payments, store of value, and many many other use cases is huge. The fact its a protocol and can be built into anyone's project, its open source, and has a growing active community supports its future success. Bitcoin is peanuts right now and the price is 400, imagine if this catches on. I'd say buying a few bitcoin with your extra cash is a good gamble.

Coinbase is terrible at setting fees and doesn't let you set your own.   I understand their position though,  either they set it too low and people complain their transaction are taking too long.  Or they set it too high and people complain the fees are too high.
Coinbase should allow you to set your own fee.  Or at least give you an option for high priority high fee transaction, or low priority low fee transaction.

They give store credit. This is very common with stores accepting bitcoin. They sell most of their bitcoins immediately with coinbase/bitpay/etc so they have no way of offering BTC refund. Most will only give store credit, and as you said its in their terms of service.   Until we see companies holding bitcoin, paying suppliers/distributors in bitcoin this won't change.

I still think the best solution is BIP SIPA (~17% annual growth rate) with higher initial immediate block size say 4mb. Basically BIP SIPA back dated to when the 1 MB limit was originally set. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:42:23
I think BIP SIPA combined with higher initial block size say 4MB, would be superior to both and could easily gain consensus from all parties. Just my opinion though.

The value of bitcoin needs to grow in order to control its volatility. Thinking of bitcoin as a commodity or asset instead of currency is necessary for financial institutions to invest, bring up the market cap and by doing so reducing volatility. In order for bitcoin to be used as a currency, it will most likely need to grow from a commodity market first.
