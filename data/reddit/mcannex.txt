It's definitely worth it to mine with dedicated equipment and more worth it when BTC is at 10k+... energy costs are more than covered ATM ... seems like people want to keep mining a secret or something ... least its smart till the next halving event

1) These people also traffic children into sex slavery, so be careful not to glorify them  
2)  They are probably moving to alt coin because their heart was never really in Bitcoin and they just need a functional currency for money laundering and BTC is too popular for it to be comfortable running your child porn transactions through, regardless of how secure you think it is.... it's getting a lot of attention and I assume they don't like that

There's legitimate value in both. Ad hom arguments are good and valid, while abusive ad homs are not. These people aren't being judge on anything they didn't choose.

There was a bona fide dip 2 weeks prior to the BCH fork, but circumstances are quite different now it seems. The 2Xcon fork 'threat' may actually be strengthening BTC due to overall attention it's getting and the unity of the users kind of displaying the very cool nature of a deregulated currency.

Why? They aren't supporting 2x so why not let it go down in flames?

Why is it a problem for Bitcoin to be back on the high difficulty it was at the time of the fork? That's expected, right? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:57:25
Can you choose to manifest some, none, or all of your coins on either fork? On both? How does this not just duplicate everything and diminish value, or does it (BCH worth much less than BTC, while BTC is really strong still despite the fork)?

But, isn't nakomoto consensus dependent on the blockchain technology? The interesting thing about bitcoin to me is that it's thriving despite being a clear threat to central powers.

'If the coins on the contentious hard fork have any value...' Sick burn

That helps, thank you. Does the 2X group have any leverage to retain people? Seems like most folks would just as well be done dealing with them altogether.

In other news: the sky is blue.  
  
Not actual news if you follow this sub, but:  
  
Lee suggested that they continue to list Bitcoin as BTC since it's the incumbent chain and since the NYA didn't obligate them to anything regarding naming conventions.  
  
"...It’s the people who use the coin that gives it value, and miners will mine the coin that makes them the most money. And right now, pretty much all the Bitcoin Core developers and a large part of the community including a lot of prominent figures in this space have come out against this hardfork,” Lee explained.

TL;DR: This is good for bitcoin

This is just not true... I've recently come back to Bitcoin after looking at it a few years ago. I work in the payment processing industry and it was not at all clear what the relationship of BCH to BTC was at first. It became clear pretty quickly, but it does take some amount of learning to realize what's what. For anyone remotely informed, sure, there's no confusion... but in terms of alt coin affects on adoption/new user on-boarding there are definite concerns in my mind at least.

I have read that you can't signal for hard forks, so what gives? Are we 95% signaling NYA or can hard forks not be signaled for? I'm brand new, go easy on me.

Why call Bitcoin 'S1X' when Bitcoin is Bitcoin?

The benefit of having a $2.60 energy drink right now outweighs the risk that Shift is an elaborate scheme 
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:36:53
I think most people are invested as BTC as a store of value but also realize it's full potential will eventually be unlocked in being an actual functioning currency, so it's both/and here IMO. Buy energy drinks all day long, but rebuy your depleted BTC with fiat if you are a hodler. There are very few people who just want to buy stuff with BTC because it's cool, for now at least.

A temporary 75% paycut to gain control of Bitcoin for the future would be a bargain. Taking a big temporary loss with BTC AT 4400 USD to essentially own it when it hits 44k ... easy math? Thankfully, it looks like the majority are core/legacy loyalists and have told the NYA signers to go fork themselves.

As far as I can tell, there was a dip a couple weeks prior to the BCH fork, no? Super new TBH. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:10:30
Very good points. Plus we can actually transact still, just at a slower rate, right? What does miner signaling entail BTW?
