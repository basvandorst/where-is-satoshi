Even if I do get back my Bitcoinica money I'll have trouble ever trusting another exchange again. It sucked loosing that much money in an instant.

Can anyone vouch for this site? Any successful orders?

Yes advertise to this subreddit. We have enough info in the sidebar for people to do their own research. People would be much less inclided to visit an external site from the ad. People feel comfortable on reddit.

Why is he just coming out now? Bitcoinica was almost a year ago.

I think this is great for bitcoin. Most sites are trying to sell computer or tech things for bitcoins. Having this will expand the market to other people. The site looks great too even if your not into furries.

What's that plugin called? It sounds awesome.

This has to be fake or it's his own address. Nobody is stupid enough to tip someone $2,000.

I've changed my mind too. When I first heard about bitcoins I thought it was a stupid idea (based on negative comments), as long as people see the positive comments they can change their mind too.

He actually sounds pretty sincere. But then again so did Zhou and Pirate.

Yes this would be great and I'm sure people will tip with the Bitcoin bit every thread.

I beg to differ.

Ya I'd like to put this up all over the place. This could be huge for adding new users.

Tell me about it! We have free shipping on the 5 bar pack if you're interested.

Coinbase if you're in the US allows bank transfers with low fees.

You should have waited to post this until you actually had proof. Now you just sound crazy.

Thanks for this. Just won some money playing blackjack on Bitzino.
