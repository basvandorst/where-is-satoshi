Just because this guy is good at coding doesn’t mean he’s a visionary. Most of these guys lack awareness.

Lol where you gonna spend it at??? It will take 20 minutes for the cashier to actually get confirmation you paid if you can even find someone that accepts it. Moronic post.... go find your 3 businesses that accept it in your town and be a pioneer.

Day traders and scalpers seem like the leeches to me.... big money sits cool and collects the motherload patiently while “day traders” scurry around like roaches looking at the markets 24/7. Some people are investors... nickel dime trades that enter and exit the markets are temporary liquidity. The paper champ....

I lived in Saudi for a year... they made it so that I couldn’t use a vpn for a week but they still couldn’t trace anything depending on what vpn you use. China is probably more savvy than the Saudis. I don’t think they’d care too much about a westerner avoiding their bs just their nationals. Also with billions of people there I don’t see how they can dedicate the manpower for this.

It happens even in the US and we’ve been very tolerant of crypto.

Yes.... I want more virtual currency trusting that the exchanges I’m buying from are actually facilitating these trades
