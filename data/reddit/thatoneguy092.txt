Depends on your strategy. There are ways to make money other than holding if you need $ short term. Still, holding is clearly more profitable long term

Yes I dont understand keeping large sums of coin on an exchange anyway unless you're an active trader. You're essentially trusting the exchange not to get hacked.

And to be fair, the opposite is true:
BTC goes up by 5%, every other coin in the top 100 bounces up 13%

You misunderstand. This is an old order for 50 btc that at the time cost just under 5k. They are just getting around to asking him to update his info and will deduct 4.8k and give him 50 fucking btc

Looking to get my first whole BTC soon! 
I got into crypto during the ETH boom from 40-300, looking to branch out. 
My meager stack is going to love this dip

I've got a buy for 5050
Because there's a 5050 chance anyone knows what the fuck is going to happen next.

Congrats on your future house paid in cash. Wish I could invest like you rn

Why would BTC go off and have corporate interest in the first place? What value does it add to the world? Research these questions first before buying.

No, they're buying. This is what you do when you have influence. Do the opposite of what you think average joe will do.

Trend lines point to 2800ish as next support. I'd wait to buy there
