The only thing I've seen that looks a little screwy is the fact BCH/USD rate is currently showing as $30,607, apart from that it looks good.

Or go down the Scientology route. When all the hodlers are rich enough to afford high priced lawyers, bombard them with law suits until they declare Bitcoin as a religion and write-off the tax bill.

There aren't even that many Bitcoin in circulation. About 17million have been mined, but its estimated 4million have been lost forever.

Just make sure when you've got plenty of your own money from your investment and forward-thinking, she remembers she wanted nothing to do with it. Have fun spending your new found wealth, get a new wife. Live happily ever after.

The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 420 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 94,920 satoshis.

I Use Kraken and am in the UK. I set up an account with Fidor. They offer SEPA transfer rates of only £2.49, compared with most UK banks at £10. I transfer what I want to deposit from my main bank account into my Fidor account via usual means. Then transfer from Fidor to Kraken using SEPA. You will end up with Euros in your Kraken account but who cares. It's the cheapest way to fund from the UK.

They're lost forever, so yes, the final number of BTC will be less than 21 million.

Yes, definitely has lots more room for a deeper correction I believe. But still, looks like the bullish run might be set to continue.

They're just mad because the only time their altcoin moves north is when it's being pumped, otherwise it's a slow descent into regret and bag holding.

Kind of, you're using the fiat value of your coin to cover the cost of the leverage. We're only talking 2x here, it's pretty safe territory in terms of the price movements of the past. Bitcoin historically drops around 40% during the dips. So if you put one BTC in an exchange, and buy @ 2:1 during the recovery of the dip, the the price would have to drop 50% for you to lose your coin. On the other hand, if the price rises 50%, then not only does the value of your coin go up by 50%, but you would earn the same amount in fiat. This is my experience. I tried it on Kraken, it worked for me. I'm not saying it works every time. I might have been lucky.

A slow but certain non-reliance on the ever-present, immutable, banking cartel.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:01:26
Yes, as far as I'm aware, this is how it functions. You also pay a tiny amount of bitcoin or fiat (whichever you select), every 4 hours, whilst your position is open. I'm talking like 65p (75c US). This is the "interest" you pay for borrowing that $1000.
No, you will not owe them more than is in your account.

Go 2x long using a single coin. That's advice from Richard Heart. I took his advice and did make euros from it. I closed the long and used the profits to buy more BTC. I will do that again when the next dip occurs (~30-40% down from current)

It's not wise to be spending it before we see some real stabilisation IMO. It's discovering its price. This is the free market in action.
