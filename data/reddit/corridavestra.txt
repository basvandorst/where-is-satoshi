It did fail though (sadly). Falling from 20k to 3k is death by every mean. Now, yes, it also gets artificially resurrected every now and then, but in financial terms it's unstable and a bad investment, so basically a major failure -- as it should be, by the initial design of "Mr" Nakamoto. You know, that initial spec, which assumes it is going to be used as a real currency, and especially not a wall street profit machine..  again failure. It's success in the originally targeted use cases is marginal at best (again, sadly).

Anyway it's not that important to waste too much time over in reddit discussions :) I'm fine with it being mainstream, also fine with it disappearing, so good luck if you are invested in it. ��

But it did take off, on the crypto markets, where it wasn't supposed to. And then it fell. In financial terms, losing 80% of value is practically death.. sure, it didn't go to zero -- which was probably due to one of the tech's best stabilization features (slow replication and slow transactions) -- but.. it did lose most of its peak value.
I mean, this is good for the coin, as the point of it was to be a real currency, not some random stock value. And to be adopted and regulated, it needs to go way down, closer to 1. Think about it, which "real" currencies are 2000x stronger than a dollar or euro? Unfortunately while it's fluctuating like this, it's not doing any good for the adopters, especially not for companies or legislation. So yeah, financially speaking, it dies quite often and gets resurrected quite often too, until that trend stops we won't be seeing much of it in the mainstream.
