NW Ohio.  Not a densely populated area, but we have a large oil company with their HQ in town, and the past few years have brought a ton of relocations into town and drove up home prices in our small town (and surrounding) quite a bit faster than other sections of the state.

We have not purchased yet.  We actually had an appointment with our bank to get preapproved on the day before the rate cut rumors were starting to fly so we moved it out until this coming Monday.  So, as much as I do not believe that the rate cut was a smart move, it definitely worked in our favor.

This is my dream.  I obviously do not get excited about people being in bad situations and getting destroyed.  What I mean is to be on the right side of any kind of a great deal on a real estate purchase.  My wife and I have been looking for the past six months to buy our first home.  We saved, did went about things the right way (probably saved cash slower than we would have since I insisted on using cash to buy BTC and LTC in 2018, but glad we did), ANYWAY, watching housing values go up 2% per MONTH where we live and thinking "What in the actual fuck?!" the whole time was a bit depressing and made me question if I should have waited and saved for a bigger down payment like we did instead of moving earlier before things were going nuts.  
Well...I certainly rambled a bit there, but I am leaving it because I think many of you will know exactly what I am talking about and will most likely relate.  Thanks guys. :-)

You know, there have HAD to have been many divorces where the wife heard her husband's constant ramblings on "Our Bitcoin is worth ____ now!" and "I really can't miss this dip", etc., then the wife brings the BTC up in divorce proceedings, only to have the husband say "no...actually, I lost that somehow".
