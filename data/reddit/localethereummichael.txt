Disappointing customer service.
You could easily recover this user's lost $5,000, but you've chosen not to, or you don't understand what's going on.
@_date: 2018-08-21 11:23:06
I'm really sorry about your situation. I hope you get your money back soon.
@_date: 2019-11-21 02:16:30
No, we don't ask for your identity. Other traders might.
@_date: 2019-11-21 00:10:42


That is an unequivocal lie. There has never been any leak of account data whatsoever, or any intrusion ever, and hence no "cover up". Please present even a shred of evidence to back up that extraordinary claim — where/when/what was this data breach you mention, and how did we cover it up?
Also, the vast majority of user data is encrypted, including the self-custodial wallets and any messages shared between users. The only unencrypted data is the public offer book and information such as emails (which have never been leaked or breached contrary to your comment).
@_date: 2019-11-20 04:07:21
If you use LocalCryptos, it's impossible for us to freeze your account. Your keys, your coins.

The most user data we have is your email and (optionally, if you choose to provide it for notifications) your phone number. Messages are end-to-end encrypted; unless you report a trade or open a dispute, we can't read the contents of messages sent between users (e.g. bank account details, names, photo attachments, whatever).
@_date: 2019-11-21 23:50:23
You need to work on your reading comprehension. You're going in circles now, regurgitating the same unfounded nonsense about a nonexistent issue.
Everything you wrote here has already been responded to my reply above.
To reiterate: There was no hack or breach. The data you saw is a public S3 bucket, which you can think of as a shared folder that everybody has read and write access to. It has nothing *whatsoever* to do with "user wallet data". The data in there is not related to wallets in any way. It's not user data. It is 100% useless gibberish binary trash to you.
Also, you reddit account is brand new. You made this account just to try to slander us. The Telegram account you used to randomly come in and ask these questions was also freshly created and anonymous. I'm not sure who you are, but I'm sure you have an agenda.
I won't be wasting my time replying anymore.
@_date: 2019-11-21 00:26:27
Awesome. Unfortunately we don't have an ETA yet, but we'll announce when we do.
We don't plan (currently) on open sourcing everything, but only the client-side SDK, which is the biggest and most important component given the cryptography-heaviness.
Anybody will be able to use the SDK to create a custom LocalCryptos interface, or to create a trading bot, for example.
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:26:17
Open source is already on the roadmap!
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:19:29
Keep in mind that messages on LocalCryptos are end-to-end encrypted and your wallet is self-custodial.
The most data we have is your email address, and anything you make public (i.e. your offers).
@_date: 2019-11-20 04:06:39
There have already been two (known) hacks against LocalBitcoins users. One time the official forum site was taken over and redirected to a phishing site.

For more liquidity, I invite you to try LocalCryptos, which is also non-custodial and end-to-end encrypted. The trading fee is 0.75% if you respond to an offer or 0.25% if you create an offer (fees are priced into the rates, so no math is necessary).
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:09:50


Ah, I thought that might be you!
As I told you in the AMA (which [hasn't been deleted]( you can scroll up in the Telegram group and find your messages), this data is indistinguishable from gibberish due to the nature of cryptography. Thus it is totally useless. It's not possible to decrypt that data — not even by brute-force using a wordlist of weak/common passwords, because those files are not encrypted with passwords.
This data is encrypted attachments shared between users in encrypted messages. Each file is encrypted with an ephemeral 256-bit key using AES.
These attachments are uploaded directly from the user to Amazon S3 for speed, unlike all other data (which is not stored in Amazon S3). It is essentially a public read-write S3 bucket, which isn't a problem because any file is useless to anyone other than the sender or recipient.
The indecipherable data in there has nothing to do with self-custodial web wallets nor any other part of the platform. That is not our database.


Other people? [That was also you.](
You asked if we use Google Analytics to track users, and I replied no, because we don't have Google Analytics or any other third-party trackers on the platform. I told you that we only use a self-hosted tool (Matomo) for internal analytics, and the data never leaves our possession. [I later clarified to you]( that we do have GA on the blog subdomain, but not the trading platform. None of these messages were deleted, as you know. You [thanked me for the clarification](


The [blog post recap]( is just that: a recap. The entire transcript was edited for length/readability, and your questions didn't make the cut. Many other questions were also not included in the blog post, but remain in Telegram. You know this, but you're lying.


Anybody can check for themselves that the keys are being encrypted and sent to the API as described in the whitepaper (PBKDF2 + AES-256-CBC). You know this. Advanced users can also choose to not use the web wallet by logging in directly with an Ethereum web3 wallet. This is something I want to replicate for Bitcoin, but not at the sacrifice of UX. Work ahead!


1. I work for myself.
2. I don't want people to trust me; that's the point.
Edit: Included screencaps of your chats to make sure it's known you are lying, and your attempt at anonymous slander using a 1-day-old reddit account has utterly failed.
@_date: 2019-11-20 04:09:21
You can use LocalCryptos, the most popular non-custodial P2P Bitcoin marketplace. We launched yesterday after renaming from LocalEthereum.
@_date: 2019-11-21 00:28:08
Yep! LocalEthereum is no more. We considered creating a new platform, but then we'd have to start from zero users and manage two websites, which seems like an unnecessary headache.
Our LocalEthereum traders have been asking for Bitcoin for a long time.
@_date: 2019-11-20 20:44:32
@_date: 2019-11-24 01:23:00
Try LocalCryptos. Also non-custodial and private, yet good liquidity.
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:20:12
Sorry you feel that way.
@_date: 2019-11-30 06:18:36
Your comment is based on the false premise that you don't know and can't know who you're trading with. There is nothing stopping you from asking for the identity of the other party. Messages are hidden from third parties like us; if you're involved in the trade, you're not a third party.
@_date: 2019-11-21 23:41:42
Welcome back, anonymous 1-day-old account created to slander us. Our website has never been breached, as you know.
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:59:28
I made a post to announce it, and it was shortly after deleted and blacklisted. I'm not sure why — we have a proven reputation as the most popular non-custodial P2P marketplace.
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:09:20

In response to today, LocalEthereum has [reduced the trading fee on cash exchanges to 0%]( From today until July 1st, you can buy or sell ETH with cash using LocalEthereum for free.
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:57:14
Use LocalEthereum and SideShift.AI. No hoops, self custodial and end-to-end encrypted.
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:41:57
I would've have said anything if the parent comment didn't list us. :-)
It's an alternative. If you want BTC, an option is to buy ETH and then exchange the ETH for BTC using something like SideShift.AI.
@_date: 2019-06-02 06:58:55
I pulled the number from [BitcoinFees.info]( If you're saying that's not the average fee, you are wrong and possibly in denial.
Also, Ethereum doesn't charge per byte like that.
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:37:40
What makes you say that? I like Bitcoin and Ethereum; both are useful for different things.
Ethereum is cheaper and faster than BTC, and has greater script capabilities (Bitcoin doesn't relay nonstandard scripts and most of the super cool op codes were disabled in 2010).
@_date: 2019-06-02 11:07:03
Right. And which Lightning Network wallets work on my phone which are self-custodial (without the extra steps of installing and managing a node on a remote dedicated server)?
I like Lightning Network (we sponsor LN research) and Bitcoin, but I think your "on-chain is so last year" is false. LN isn't nearly ready for production yet; don't kid yourself.
@_date: 2019-08-22 23:06:41
There weren't really any Bitcoin brokers in 2009. There was hardly a market price until Gox launched in mid 2010.
The only popular place to buy/sell BTC over the counter in those days was IRC ( on Freenode).
@_date: 2019-06-02 04:15:46
Sure, as long as "whatever script you want" is a max of 10kB (520 without Segwit) and doesn't do anything semi-complex such as verify a signature of a custom message or check the balance of another address.
At 178 sat/byte (the current fee), remember that you're paying about 1.6c per input script byte. A 1kB script carries a transaction fee of $16. Much higher when BTC throughput hits the block cap again.
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:50:17
Try building DAI on the BTC chain and get back to me.
@_date: 2019-06-02 11:16:06


If you consider holding your own private keys a tough condition, then it's not ready yet.


But you don't need a fully-synced archive node to send a secure transaction. LN works very differently. I can point you to many different Ethereum wallet apps that give you access over your keys plus fast and secure transactions with programmable money. You can't do the same for LN wallets.

No, reorgs aren't unthinkable on Bitcoin. Countless reorgs have happened in the past, including notable ones spanning *more than 10 blocks*.
For example, in August 2010, 53 blocks were orphaned due to [this major incident]( when millions of BTC were accidentally printed.
Before you respond "oh but that was ages ago when Bitcoin was only a baby!", keep in mind that the fork occurred when the Bitcoin chain was 18 months old. The DAO fork happened in July 2016, when the Ethereum chain was only 12 months old.
For the record, I vehemently opposed the DAO bug fork and the vast majority of the community oppose any protocol-level "recovery" for an application bug. I strongly believe it won't happen again.


You could say the same about BTC-maxi and LN proponent culture. Search YouTube for "Magical Crypto Conference" for some A-grade lambo/ego/price cringe (they brought an actual living bull to the conference — we've never done anything like that).
@_date: 2019-12-02 03:56:59
Right. Public knowledge, yet you're the *only* person on the internet mentioning it, despite LocalCryptos having more than 100,000 users. (And you have presented exactly zero evidence of a data breach; if there was a data leak, show me some data.)
No results

Cool wallet though! I have it installed already.  ;-)

Given the account was created just to slander our business anonymously, I'd say they are most likely a shill. Their first post was the same unfounded claim of a "data breach", and now they're following my account around with the same nonsense.

Localethereum is a dApp; it has decetralized escrows and end-to-end encrypted messages. We don't hold or escrow any crypto ourselves, and we can't decrypt your messages ([unless one party raises a dispute](
@_date: 2019-09-06 05:14:45
