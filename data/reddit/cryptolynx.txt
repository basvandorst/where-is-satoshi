.bit is already active, and censorship resistant on the bitcoin/namecoin blockchain!
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:25:00
more like 100% attack from inception-&gt;
@_date: 2014-07-04 15:42:02

@_date: 2014-07-09 21:55:39
bit•coin, bit•coin, bit•coin (slow yet enthusiastic chant)
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:32:10
although bitcoin users tend to be smart enough not to pay for cable.
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:51:22
did you just?
@_date: 2014-08-15 07:31:20
more like a short-squeeze on goxcoins that never existed in the first place-&gt;
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:12:56
if you write on their bitcointalk forum they're more likely to payout.
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:35:58
what about gold?
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:50:27
beat that @_date: 2014-07-03 01:54:30
because bitcoin isn't just *paper*.
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:10:06
roger knows.
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:17:56
@_date: 2014-07-21 00:49:48

then we'd *really* see moon.
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:02:48
ah, the good ol' reverse-psychology.
@_date: 2014-08-14 19:38:02
kinda self-explanatory, considering they're *exponential*.
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:11:57

*irresponsible*, we'll put.
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:43:44
@_date: 2014-08-10 18:19:59
though it only takes weeks on the *fiat* side of the transfer.
@_date: 2014-08-03 01:06:34
no amount of "features" could trump BTC *utility* value.
@_date: 2014-07-23 03:43:55
it doesn't *exist.*
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:17:51
no frills?
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:05:01
@_date: 2014-07-07 22:52:16
ah k cool, another reason to drink-&gt;
@_date: 2014-07-14 00:31:23
this is actually *good* news?
oh sorry, that phrase may no longer be relevant-
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:01:36
internet currency government cannot print on paper.
@_date: 2014-07-10 16:47:31
