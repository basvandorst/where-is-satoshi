All my predictions come good ,  it's a strange ability,  my great grand father was a very famous mathematician and actually has numerous books and has his portrait in the national gallery in London.  Now I'm somewhat retarded but the genius seems to lurk on behind the scenes . Bask in my retarded genius.

Everyone's currently holding their breath , which as we know leads to brain damage. But the rise to 900 should be fun.

Shit joke . Saying" their on the money" then saying thats like mother teresa, implies that she too was" on the the money" in general. Id say referencing someone else would improve it. Any ideas?
