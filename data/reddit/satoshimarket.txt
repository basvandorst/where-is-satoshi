If your computer is hacked and say for example they take your withdraw password all that can be done is finalize the order (to the seller), so unless the seller is the hacker, there is nothing to gain.
They could also decrypt your private key, but this would not unlock any funds because 2 private keys are required to unlock the funds in Multi-sig escrow.  Thus the hacker would have have access to a buyers computer and a sellers computer; or either buyer or seller and the market private key for the particular escrow transaction.
- To add to this we are in the process of adding 2FA for login using Google Authenticator.

You mean once an order is finalized?  The money is sent from the multi-sig escrow address to an address you choose (in your account profile).  So for example your blockchain.info wallet, or directly to your Coinbase account to move some of the funds to fiat if you wish.
