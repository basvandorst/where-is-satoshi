I have noticed this at times too, but often coinbase's price is higher than Circles. Not always. It fluctuates a little bit.
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:01:40
Yes. It tells me during that phase that some files could not be found or were skipped. Not infront of it right now to copy it exactly.
@_date: 2014-07-19 19:12:07
My limit after linking my bank account Is 2500. I bought $20.00 worth this morning and it was also available instantly, and with no fee at all. As much as I have liked using coinbase, at the moment I no longer have a need for them. Of course I still don't understand what garuntee this insurance actually gives me, so I will not be keeping anything over $100 on their site. Why should I need to when I have my own secure system in place that I trust? Of course if my mom wanted some bitcoin it would probably be safer for her to store it on circle than try to figure out a paper wallet.

852 bits Welcome!
@_date: 2014-05-21 19:32:07
I do have questions. I don't understand any of it! Haha. What info do I need to gather and input to get it to work?
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:11:46
Ok so i did your first step. Where do I type in qt4? I am a Ubuntu noob
@_date: 2014-07-16 17:46:18
Of course I can not add funds until my bank account is linked in a couple of days, so I can not say for sure if there is not an inflated price for the coin. But if there is then that really crushes their entire model... 
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:17:19
What is the best way for me to account for coins I have spent.
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:32:45
Right now its only $1.00 difference. I'm not tryign to be a circle fanboy but I have tested this a few times and it just seems like normal varience, not them "charging a fee"

@_date: 2014-07-16 18:25:23
I love the cinicism. All I am interested in is this idea of being able to buy coin, for free, instantly. Then instantly sending it off site to my harddrive and paper wallets that I control the keys to... That is the part I am excited to try out, and that is also not possible until my bank is confirmed.
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:09:47
For the lazy, can someone upload a template for this spreadsheet? Pls thx :D If it's already posted, I'm sorry, but I did scroll through the thread... lazily....

1 gentlemen to you sir! @_date: 2014-07-16 18:23:06
The balance shows in big bold letters in USD, but under that is the actual bitcoin balance. The USD balance flucuates with the exchange rate, which would imply to me that they are holding bitcoin for you not USD. I should note that I tried to send the 10$ away to my Elecrum wallet but it will not let me send bitcoin until my bank is verified. I would not suggest sending any bitcoin from an outside account until you know you can withdrawl. Also I do not see any reason why I would send any bitcoin to it because I still feel more comfortable with holding my keys.
@_date: 2014-12-01 19:56:58
Yeah I don't get it. Somehow it looks like someone ends up making a lot of money off of some kind of altcoin or something.
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:27:48
I use coinbase to buy my coins but I prefer to pay with Electum or phone qr scan on overstock. I enjoy watching bitcoin do exactly what it was ment to do. I like enjoy watching the confirmations etc. Uh oh... I think I might have a problem...
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:35:28
* sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin 
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt
I have tried it with typing 'install bitcoin-qt' and 'install bitcoin'
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:43:05
Depends if there was a backup of the keys.
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:24:23
I always get this error. It is very frustrating.
* E: Unable to locate package bitcoin-qt
@_date: 2014-06-05 18:29:49
I do plan on checking that out for sure. Is it mostly a place to meet other bitcoiners for trades and information or are there actual merchants set up there?
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:28:45
852 bits Welcome!
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:30:17
After following the commands I end up with error:

@_date: 2014-05-21 19:42:09
OK sorry I did not see the other sheets. It should make much more sense to me now.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:35:38
I can't work out the details but maybe a pgp encrypted email could be sent, with only one pharmacy's public key, meaning you would only be able to pick it up at that one location.
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:32:56
This is interesting to me. I'm on the verge of convincing my boss to accept bitcoin. If he does, I wonder if I could get him to pay part of my wages (or anyone elses who is interested) with the bitcoin that he makes (if any). In that case it would be a way for me to slowly acumulate bitcoin, without paying any exchange fees. Even if it is just a little bit per pay period this would be very attractive to me, and possibly one or two others that I work with. We could start our own mini bitcoin economy right here in this tiny town.

This is why I do not trade. It's ok to have these thoughts if you are just buying and holding... I'm along for the ride, but will not sell emotionally. I do keep buying though all the way down...
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:34:28
Where can I get the best info on getting started with mining?

@_date: 2014-07-17 01:19:26
Ah I see now. I was pressing the 'Withdraw' button not the 'Send' tab. Obviously I would not be able to withdraw to bank account until my account is confirmed. Got it.

As far as I can tell, there are no features other than a nice interface, insurance, and no buy or sell fees (can you sell?) I guess we just have to wait and see if all of that is true and stands the test of time. Then I really do see this having potential to help increase adoption.

One thing I would change is that there are NO FEES for the merchant unless they are moving their coins around... The buyer may or may not have to pay this fee... Unless I have something wrong?

@_date: 2014-12-11 05:26:05
I saw this yesterday. It was the first time I have "randomly" ran into bitcoin. I'm a jam band fan and so I have used them a lot for music. Donated 20$ right away.
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:13:39
As far as I can tell though, the fees for this account are no different than the one I had before... No fees as long as I have direct deposit.
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:02:25
I am using 32bit 14.04
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:29:51
Sounds fishy. There are plenty of very good easy to use free open source wallets. Electrum is what I reccomend. The seed backup is so simple and easy.
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:27:02
I am really confused as to if I donated or not and how I will get access to the first rounds of mining. I set up a counterparty wallet as the instructions said, and then sent some BTC to the donation adress. Now what?
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:24:15
I'm kind of new to this. Most of the crashes I've seen had an obvious news related correspondence. This one has no outside issue that is clear to me, and I'm surprised no one is talking about it.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:52:45
Is it possible for apps like this to be harmful?
@_date: 2014-07-19 19:13:46
I am also still in awe about this.

Pita City in the lower West sideish. The guys there were very helpful, although it seemed to be their first time someone came in to pay with butcoin. The food was good too.
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:53:41
I did not realize it had to be in specific increments. I don't like that at all. I was thinking how great it was that some places were starting to use the "load your account with bitcoin" idea, because it gives a way for people to combine some bitcoin and some fiat to complete a transaction. A lot of people getting microtips could at least feel the benifit even if just slightly to spending the 4000 bits someone sent them. Oh well.
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:38:02
Can somone clarify if this effects you if you already have a stable version downloaded and installed? Should I stop using it? Is data that was encrypted with a stable supported version effected?

Why are more people not talking about what I think is the coolest part about this all. The "load your account with bitcoin" approach is perfect. It allows for people to actually use tips to help them buy something real. More sites like overstock etc should do this. Micropayments.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:30:55
Maybe I'm just a victim of the hype in this sub but the more I read the more confident I am in the technology as a game changer in the future. Still hurts to see literally 1 hour after every buy I make the price to drop 50$. Have not made one gain yet, but I guess I wouldn't if I'm not selling. It's not like I got into this for day trading, but it's addictive to watch.
@_date: 2014-10-03 01:28:15
The point isn't that Coinbase and BitPay are some how better than JPM... The point is that Bitcoin is a step towards a world where you might not have to give up all this private data just to make financial transactions.
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:52:06
It is bitpay. I posted a screenshot of what it looks like in thier back office. I'm hoping to enable it at the store I work at tomorrow.

Exchange rate on circle right now is 616. Preev says 617 and bitstamp says 616

@_date: 2014-05-13 02:03:00
So a colored coin would be worth more than it's standard bitcoin equivalent. I think that is the point that I was missing. Still though I would think that the coin would only be valued if someone could trust that it really meet you owned that item.
@_date: 2015-05-23 03:43:53
i thought about blacking it out, but really all you know is that there is someone that works at that location with that name.
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:37:23
Thats what it looks like to me. Still not clear to me if you can cah out without fees too, the only reason I think this is because it sounds like they don't want to be looked at as trading platform, more of a place for the masses to buy and store bitcoin without having to be tech savy at all. If that model works they could become a major player in bringing BTC to the masses... And we know what that means ;)
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:40:03
Hhaha I wish... What I should have said is that the value of my bitcoin is greater than the value of my dollars.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:28:47
I understand that this is nothing compared to what could happen with bitcoin, but like I said, I'm new to this, and last night bought again at 610, to wake up to it being 580 today. Not a big deal, I know how it goes, you never get in at the bottom, but what I'm asking is why.
Is this a late reaction to blockchain being down?
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:53:30
Oh... then why did I see monthly payment options on their website? It did not seem to have a lot of information on it.

@_date: 2015-01-24 16:58:10
I use the same method, but I use a relatively simple BIP38 password, one that I will easily remember when needed. It probably would not be inpossible for someone to brute force my password, but this is on purpose. I will never write the password down, but in the event of me being unavailable there is a small chance my trusted ones someday could unlock the funds from their copy. Otherwise I am relying on the physical secruity at both locations more than the password. The password is really just to slow someone down if one site is comprimised. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:42:27

I do not claim to know the answers to these complicated issues, but I hope that some of these ideas have developers are working on them. I don't follow Peter Tod, but if he knows how to run an exchange following this protocol why does he not start one. It should be successful because of the amount of trust it would recive if this is indeed the best solution or a major part of it.
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:20:22
If this works, and we can fully decentralize the development of bitcoin, using bitcoin... well then I think that's pretty fucking cool.
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:55:36
i ate there once and paid in bitcoin! The guy working at the time wasn't quite sure how to do it as it was his first transaction, so we ate in while he figured it out. Really though there was nothing to it he was just nervous he would mess it up. I had to go behind the counter to scan the QR code because the POS system they had was not ideal for bitcoin. He was also very concered that the transaction did not go through because he was waiting on some confirmation email from bit pay.
The food was very good, I really liked the style of pita sadwhich they make. This all happened back in July
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:24:17
Hmm I think it actually does this for me by me putting my total current BTC in.
