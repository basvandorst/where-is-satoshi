Which "exchange"? How does the blockchain knows the exchange rate?
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:35:23
This sounds circular then: you need some centralized fiat/BTS exchanges to define the rate, so that a decentralized exchange can work?

How does your service compare with localbitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-25 10:06:28
So which one is the largest?
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:02:42
The dataset seems much earlier than that. So probably bitcoinica?

Would you mind give a link to the kickstarter project?

Isn't that the Bitcoin system will crash when quantum computer is invented? Because the cryptography assumptions would be broken.

Too bad that I lost it then. Does someone running this script regularly?

u/bitfloor is actually younger than u/BitfloorPR, eh?

My bitcoin withdrawal haven't appear on blockchain after a long time, it's even *not* zero confirmation. Why??
@_date: 2013-07-22 08:19:04
Did you get this through Google translate?
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:24:10
Will Mtgox send the TX to a particular miner in this case?
@_date: 2013-12-22 03:57:07
No. Those fake tradings still happen after they had fees.
@_date: 2013-10-17 08:08:41
I think the question here is why could you send a TX with such huge fee through mtgox.
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:13:35
Well all the 10 BTC fee goes to BTC Guild. However will the hacker be this stupid? Or could this just be some bug in Mtgox?
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:24:14
Yeah. This completely rules out some merchant services aka. Coinbase in China.
@_date: 2013-07-19 11:55:58
How long does it take for you to send me the gift card after I paid Bitcoin? Is it instant?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:25:52
So how do I find out the my txn hash? Is that the "Transaction reference" sent in the email when I withdrawal?
@_date: 2013-09-02 12:47:39
I would like a free-trial too, or something like a freemium model.
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:25:11
And if I remember correctly, it's also BTC Guild got those coins at that time?
