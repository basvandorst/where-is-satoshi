Keep responding please it's fun seeing you try so hard to cover your mistake.  I never said conspiracy theories are true, just admit your mistake sit down like a good kid

This doesn't answer any of my questions

Learn how to read.  Nobody said the price isn't real.  Are you schizophrenic?

You're still avoiding my questions, but anyway I think I got a clear answer from this thread in general.
Basically, unless all exchanges are regulated (which we may or may not want) there's nothing preventing them from price fixing as long as they stay within a window of plausible deniability.  It may or may not be happening and it's just a risk to be aware of

I'm basically asking how we verify that the calculations are honest.  Buy and sell orders meet at many prices.  What mechanism forces exchanges to pick the price that maximizes volume?
Please read the 3 fake scenarios I made up.  I'm not saying any of them are real, I'm asking what stops them from happening (for my own education).

Asking how rules are enforced is not the same as saying the rules have been broken.  I guess this concept is too difficult for you?  There's always one I guess...

Can anyone link me to a resources where I can read about the audits and learn more?  That's exactly what I'm asking for

You're hilarious.  I never disagreed with any of this stuff that you're trying to change the subject to.  You thought someone was claiming conspiracy theories but nobody is.  I called you out and now you are trying to save face by changing the subject.  
Please keep responding and making yourself look dense.

For 1) I don't understand why people would be pissed off.  How would you even know?  People don't leave even when an exchange totally freezes buy or sell orders (literally happened on coinbase hours ago).  If you fix the price to be $0.50 higher than it really is, almost nobody will notice unless there is an audit mechanism, and the exchange would easily make millions.  The price can vary across exchanges by hundreds or even thousands of dollars (coinbase and gdax are the same company and they are off by hundreds of dollars right now)
For 2) that makes sense.   I guess this tells me that if I am a whale who needs to buy or sell a huge amount of Bitcoin, then it would be dumb to buy or sell only Bitcoin.  I should buy a wide range of coins so that I move the price of the entire market rather than just the price of Bitcoin
3) again how would you know.  The price across exchanges varies wildly right now

This doesn't answer the question at all.  The price of bitcoin varies across exchanges by hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
See here: 
Price varies by thousands and there are millions in liquidity
