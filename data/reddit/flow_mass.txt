Yeah I do understand that, I should have phrased it. Better, how does a market such as Plus500 or etrade decide how much a bitcoin is?

what dip?

The thing is I for me I don't give a fuck if it was with Bitcoin or dollars, he created a website that people used to sell so much drugs. Obviously illegal.

He follows me.

BITCOIN DEFENITION: a type of digital currency that uses state-of-the-art cryptography, can be issued in any fractional denomination, and has a decentralized distribution system.
Even if you don't like bitcoin, it is quite literally real money.

yeah, they were $28 two years ago, now they're $39. prices went up by $4 on Friday, or you can fly 2 hours to Indonesia and buy them for $2 a pack.
its not as bad as it seems though, apparently in America minimum wage is 7.25 an hour, over here its $20.95. (depending on your age and industry)

I'm at 0.08065, looking to round up to 1.0 or maybe a little more next week.

Wouldn't be a good idea to capitalise on the situation, sell now and buy when the price drops

Cigarette prices in Australia rose from $35 to $39 on Friday and I have quit to invest in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:39:05
what does this mean?
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:42:32
even if it drops a few percentage It's still encouraging me to save a currency even if it isnt a fiat currency. 1 seems like such an achievable goal.

By backup my wallet do you mean keep the recovery phrase?
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:29:05
So during the actual forks you will be keeping your BTC in breadwallet? Mine are in breadwallet now but I'm really unsure how I will be able to sell me bitcoin gold and the segwitx2 coin or exchange them for real bitcoin

I do understand that point and it is a valid argument to be made BUT it's important to remember that this isn't a stock, it isn't run by a CEO, its decentralised and that's why we love it.

They sent me a confirmation email and I only just thought of it I am both relieved and feel like a fucking idiot. Thanks everyone for helping guys. Green money doesn't have a community that btc has
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:41:57
That is also my plan but how do I do it quickly?
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:18:13
What if everybody uses there coins from the hardfork to buy more real bitcoin driving the price up?
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:20:02
Also remember $1500 was once an all-time high look where we are now
