Your title makes the implied comparison to Bitcoin, which fluctuates 30% over the same time. This graph only seems like Bitcoin to idiots who can't read the axis of a graph

Claiming I had a temper tantrum whilst writing an essay to a seven  line comment. Idiocy again. And still you can't understand that context makes it blatantly obvious what I refer to. Also, your very defensive over your investment, sure it's smart to traffic like that? Being emotional can distract you
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:58:24
Yeah you would make money on anything invested post Sept 18 and lost a large amount on anything invested for. Yeah these things breakdown when you change the assumptions they are predicated on, but with the assumptions I stated you are likely to have lost significant sums. If you change the timeline on Buffets active passive management bet, active management looks better.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:43:51
And yet by your other comment you understood that I was talking about the ATH, and not at any point around that.
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:59:12
I'm not sure how much I can trust bitcoin as a store of value until we see a major sell off in the equity markets. If it does well, then I will feel comfortable in it as a store of value. And yeah privacy I like, and its use of a currency might get there. But right now its difficult to love cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:01:57
It is blatantly obvious which day I spoke of, as signalled by 20k. How do you not get that. The exact terminology referring to that date doesn't matter as it is a well known point in time for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:46:23
People would have had to have bought it for it to be trading at that price. And yeah, I realise Bitcoin has had some crazy upswings, but the downswing was mental, and fell as much as most markets did in 08 recession. And this was in a time of the largest bull market in recent history. As an investment asset the volatility is way to risky and you can end up being poor as easily as rich. And yeah, being poor is shit at the moment, but my investments have a much greater chance at working out than Bitcoin does, so I'm happy.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:34:32
Your not particularly bright are you. The context and point of the comment is the exact same whether its 18 months or two years. Yes, it makes absolute sense you complete donut. If people buy and held at the all time high of 18 months ago, they are still underwater and better off buying a US gov. bond. If your this dumb and fucking around with Bitcoin, then your going to get screwed as it gains efficiency.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:00:20
Two years is a decent length of time to be negative to all time highs. Plus, how long will it take to get back there? Another year? They would have been better off buying a 5 year US Gov. Bond with 2% coupon rate than they were buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:07:16
You can do all this with a bank just as easily, especially if your paying $10k monthly, plus you get the added security of making the transaction reversible. The only thing that may not be beaten is speed, but at $12k p/a there are plenty of either online or regular bank services that would be willing to quote prices at a similar rate to the actual exchange rate. Also, you say "if the local person needs fiat" as if they ever dont need fiat. It's unlikely everywhere you visit during a day will take Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, and the local person will need to have the ability to do that, and also you bring in a third party in an exchange from what I'm aware, which incurs a minor cost and also counter party risk as you have to trust the exchange not to fuck up whilst your completing a transaction. This may not be a problem individually, but on a macro level could cause conditions where people lose a lot of money on a given day. Also, unless its massively difference elsewhere, you should be able to set up a standing order to wire the money into their accounts every month, meaning the whole transfer part is automated and you just have to monitor. 
I like Bitcoin and find it interesting, but I disagree on the ease of use, and the speed is replicated in the UK by normal banking, so its pretty unnecessary here. But I like the privacy that it has, and the potential it has in the developing world is really exciting.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:47:59
Yeah you could have done dollar cost average investment for 9 months, and your return would still be negative as the bottom wasnt until September 2018.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:16:59
Its like 6 months, and anyways does it matter? Bitcoin has underperformed every other asset class over the last 18 months, and if you had bought and held 18 months ago to now, your still down about 30-40%
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:12:56
Trading normal assets is much easier and simpler than cryptocurrency, and the infrastructure around the products is much stronger. Also, how is it auditable if your not able to show where it came from?
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:55:49
False and everywhere.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:19:47
You keep repeating that question, you got a stutter ?
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:29:32
Why? I know people who didnt try to time the market, bought at $20k, and have made a loss over the last few years, with no guarantee that they will get the money back.
Edit: If anyones got a problem with the words "few", stop being pedantic. It's clear the timeframe I'm talking about due to reference to ATH.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:08:19
Yeah cool, its been 18 months, not two years. How much difference does that actually make?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:23:13
Yeah, I was too lazy to look up the date. Bitcoin really isnt that important an asset class to know dates off by heart. Plus I have other things to do than memorise those dates. If you can tell by context what I mean, then being pedantic about it just comes of cuntish.
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:16:44
Interest rates would have to hit about - 5% for the rate to be negative on my account. Even then its better than the bitcoin volatility and not being able to predict how much I have from one day to the next
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:44:59
You started the conversation about third world I was continuing talking about third world. In the developed world sure the infrastructure is there, but the need to hide money is not. In the 3rd world the need to hide money is there but the infrastructure isn't. You need Internet access to buy/sell bitcoin and to store it you need an external save point if you don't consistently have Internet, which adds to the cost.
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:42:20
Their is no risk free saving, and some investment products are safer than bank accounts and a mattress. Houses can be robbed and banks can go bust. But if I buy a US T-bill, then I know the chance of the USA government defaulting is lower than bankruptcy and home invasions and is therefore safer. Plus if it does default, then I'll know early that armageddon is coming
Edit: also why shouldn't they be counted? Cash are just  another form of financial security, and are the exact same as investments, just with a nominal interest rate of 0%
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:06:41
Having an emotional attachment to an asset class will lose you money
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:22:41
Means absolutely fuck all unless your in a 3rd world country with family in parts of the diaspora. Or your a drug dealer on an international scale. Otherwise those factors are damaging to governments trying to collect tax to pay for schools and hospitals

Yeah please do, reddit is an awful echo chamber where the same bad economics points do the rounds on a regular basis, and most wilfully ignore facts contradictory to the narrative. I'm guessing you've read about how the republicans love money from big donors? So do the Democrats. Each party has received equal amounts from Co-ceos of renaissance technologies, yet only Mercer is vilified for it on here (probably because he gave to republicans, and his role with Cambridge analytica). But then people read a newspaper and think there informed, which is just the height of idiocy in the current polarised environment. Shame because we should be able to have balanced articles showing both sides, but we don't so we have to piece things together bit by bit.
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:59:42
Tbh most people who have thst understanding leave and don't come back here because they usually get insulted by bitcoin hodlers. It's a shame because there's a lot of brilliant people on reddit, but when you get people loving the deflationary aspects of bitcoin because it makes them rich, then degree holders in econ just walk away because what is the point
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:21:14
Yeah and only 40% have internet access and you can guarantee that the majority are rich already. And even if they have internet access on a regular basis affording all the shit to make it secure will cost more than they have. And even after that point will there be enough people taking bitcoin to make it viable to hold your daily spending money as bitcoin? I doubt it personally
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:39:27
Yep, but usually standard economic theory is hated on this sub, so putting that was to much of a stretch for me. To many crazies without a basic understanding of economics for me to put that here
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:16:20
Yeah this is why Bitcoin is pretty shit at its intended purpose
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:34:58
Yeah got a BA in Economics, and an MSc in Finance. Plus done a shit load of research on Japan and their deflationary aspects, as they had similar demographics in the late 80s as the EU has currently. So yeah, I know what happens with deflationary currencies. Plus, I'm fairly informed about the deflationary spiral, and the debate around whether its true or not. But the issue is deflationary spiral is only the beginning of issues when it comes to deflationary currencies. So your answer is yes, it comes from a much deeper place than 'deflation=bad'.
Edit: Further explanation, the problem with deflationary currencies is that they cause massive amoujnts of problems due to capital and human capital flight, as there are no great investment opportunities and usually limitations are imposed to ensure more capital doesnt leave. Further, there is the issue of ever increasing debt burdens on the population as more money has to be borrowed to fund the same level of public services, as GDP falls alongside deflation, and thus reducing the tax receipts of the country. Finally, it weakens the financial system as investment is massively disincentivised, and therefore produces a country with lower efficiency and lowers productivity due to the lack of investment. So yeah, you can disagree, but me and you both know your professors at university would be saying similar things. If you can find a professor at a top school who promotes unequivocal deflationary currencies go for it, but I doubt you will be able to.
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:02:27
Then how is it any better than money right now
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:57:41
Greece hasn't had hyperinflation since the 1940s. Fractional reserve banking did nothing to cause Greek problems. Greece cause Greek problems, and the rest of Europe bailed them out. They should have let their country collapse, they deserved it, but the immigration out of Greece would have been completely intolerable.
And it is but bitcoin does fuck all to help in its current state for the reasons above and its volatility. And the USA is not printing money, QE is not printing money, and its not a miracle the economy has done well its the USA economy being incredible compared to other developed nations
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:24:44
Name one corrupt government stealing money in the developed world? That's a 3rd world problem that isn't fixable by bitcoin until the infrastructure is in place, which it isn't right now
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:06:01
The usd value is based on 150 years of historical prices and is backed by the US government and federal banks, which in turn are backed by 350m Americans. I understand the monetary system in enough depth to see how value is given to the dollar. Bitcoin operates on similar principles.
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:18:18
It would be if hiding money is that easy. How you going to get people to pay the right amount of tax when you can't trace who any of the payments are too? And if you can trace payments that means bitcoin loses half of its purpose, that of being anonymous. Tax evasion isn't a massive problem right now, but it would be when half the country is doing it
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:16:13
For real, that's your go to thing, a Corbett report? And why is it due?
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:52:29
Nah that view is just the narrative pushed by left wing commentators, but unfortunate because I'm fairly left wing, but there just as bad as republicans when it comes to using stats to feed a propaganda point. The amount of tax evasion is absolutely dwarfed by the amount of underreported income, which is usually committed by small business owners and cash workers, but no one wants to target them (source: IRS). Most tax fraud done by the lower class is completely intentional, I mean how many waiters do you know who fully report there tips?
Stop listening to politicians they are bullshit artists of the highest degree, along with opinion pieces in from pretty much any media organisation. Go look ar the data and stats produced by top quality organisations such as the IRS, the Fed, and non biased independent think tanks. Honestly, if the general public managed to use bitcoin for everything then you can say goodbye to your schools, hospitals, military, and any other government provided service. Because when your poor evading tax is acceptable because your poor, so everyone does it. Only issue is the bottom 80% contribute about 70% of tax receipts, so you have a major issue if this happens. Bitcoin adoption is not the answer for any of the USAs woes
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:46:34
Depends how you save, if you put it under the mattress yes that will happen, but most savings are in pensions or investment accounts and so will be seeing returns above or comparable to inflation
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:57:54
This is a personal opinion, and would love to see if it is reflected in risk management protocols at banks, but I don't feel you can separate physical risks from other forms of risk. And yeah I get that, but what I'm saying is that by saving cash, you are at more risk than if you invest it. You have less of a guarantee with cash on future consumption than you do with a security like a government bond. Yes, sovereign debt is negative in lots of places, but this is why I specify USA government debt.
Further, misratings don't seem to be commonplace, a lot of sovereign debts have been downgraded to reflect the worsening environment, and I'd find it hard to accurately work out the misratings, plus recession hangover should prevent against misrating scandals like in 08. Not sure on markets, don't know whether the low interest rate environment is propping up the S&amp;P or whether its QE or just simple exuberance. It's very interesting right now, and I'd love to know. But it's difficult to say what is causing markets to act like they do, especially with PE ratios so high and yet no structural problems with the US economy.
