the news is about cryptocurrency not the writer

I don't think so dear, white papers have the longest shelf life of all content and they can be sliced and diced to meet a variety of marketing purposes and re-purposes

BitPay will convert the bitcoin into fiat currency and directly deposited to the merchant’s bank account, that is really good

This is the most common thing that political authorities must be aware about the problems that can cause here when it comes to crypto

I thought he would draw prediction with standing line
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:06:21
but he was write when price dropped around 3K, what about that, he is not from future that he can predict exact amount, this is his vision, at least he is sure that he is posting on his official twitter account, no one have that guts to show his/her thought with that assurity in public, can you do the same publicly? I think you can't
@_date: 2019-06-11 05:30:05
ohh, that google effect
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:24:30
but that doesn't mean that you can be always writer analyzing or criticizing other people, its actually true that people in new age or generation are more criticizing without understanding the concept behind "accept everything positive and apply very few of them", he is not saying that please follow my prediction so you will get more profits, he has his point
the main concept behind liking few things and disagree with other things is always depends on choice, if someone don't like apple phones they will hate it till their death, that is the truth  [**KrisBkh**](

adding bitcoin currency format can rise bitcoin price, GENIUS
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:56:13
People are really mad, when you see them talking on old stuffs like this, its about 3 years old news, still people are talking about this
