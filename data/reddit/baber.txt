It's over 11k already at coinmarketcap. Seems we are going green finally.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:23:47
And still others told it will hit 60k and then crash. High time for experts to coordinate their forecasts...  lol

Your last paragraph completely describes what I was thinking about Bitcoin while getting to grips with it for the first time. It’s true that as soon as you figure out how this all works you will no longer wish to use banks with their fees, queues and centralization. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:21:11
Yes, it’s far over $3000. According to the forecasts this could be a bad time for Bitcoins. But it was much more stable than I thought. So now it’s all good. And the rate is going higher. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:46:18
I am also holding both coins within the exchange. It makes me keep BCH ready at hand for selling if the price touches record highs. Does anyone here plan to hold Bitcoin Cash long?
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:34:10
It can only make some sense in a short term. Probably your friend believes that the rates of Bitcoin Cash will be higher and higher. For now, that is how things are really going. But there is absolutely no certainty on how long Bitcoin Cash will continue increasing in value. I think that it won’t last long. This can fortunately bring some profits, but it is very risky if you have a lot of funds on the line. I have some Bitcoin Cash, but it’s not a great amount and I got them for free. So I keep them in case the price will increase. Even if it falls I won’t regret a small amount of money.

You are right saying that it’s not only about Bitcoin specifically. Cryptocurrency is truly a new way of how finances work. But I’d also say that it’s even wider. I mean the blockchain as a whole. It is applicable to any sphere, not only financial. In this way, whomever he was, Satoshi brought us a new decentralized way of how we can communicate with each other.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:57:39
It is now considered that $5000 is not only a realistic price for Bitcoin but also a short-term one. So it will not only reach the point of 5k, but also cross it and will continue increasing.
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:16:54
When you understand that within 8 years the price of a currency has increased in thousands of times, it makes you want to buy it and wait for the same growth. But I first bought it because I believe in Bitcoin and I like the idea behind it. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:01:19
I guess, the best way is to write a private key on the paper and keep it together with the will. At least, I think i would do something like that. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:59:16
If you have money for living, I would advise you to hold all the mined bitcoins. And withdraw them only when you need to re-invest into more equipment.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:29:28
Congrats! Pretty sure that if you HODL it for some years, you will be even more excited than you are now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:03:53
Such things motivate to buy Bitcoin even at $7k, knowing that soon we’ll move to numbers like $20-50k.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:02:08
I don’t like the idea that bitcoin is better than gold. I love to think that bitcoin is the new gold of the digital era.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:57:40
I was saying the same before bitcoin surged 2, 4 and 7 thousand. Really waiting for 10k at the end of 2017, or early 2018.

 *'Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is purposely misleading consumers into thinking they’re getting Bitcoin.'* Tell me I am wrong but if consumers go to Coinbase to buy Bitcoin they theoretically understand what it is, how much it costs and how it is marked. Why it caused so much buzz at all? Coinbase is not the only exchange that lists Bitcoin Cash. Take bitfinex -  kraken -  cex -  . They also have large market shares and they launched BCH early on, and everyone was fine with it. Can’t get it, really... 
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:07:10
I love bitcoin when I know how to deal with it when the price drops...
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:03:50
Today if one wants to make large investments, he would probably go for bitcoin rather than altcoins. I would do the same. But it doesn’t mean that bitcoin will be on top forever. Really, there are many cryptocurrencies with much better functionality. So, maybe in some time another cryptocurrency will overcome bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:01:42
Wow. That’s a great idea. Because even the one who doesn’t know anything about Bitcoin will very likely come into the store. People are lazy to research about Bitcoin in the internet, however when they see a physical store, it makes them very interested.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:02:12
Yeah. The main idea is to keep in mind that Bitcoin will eventually increase. Bitcoin price is going down again, so I guess panic-selling is inevitable.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:12:25
Well, Cex.io seems to be supporting any alternative coin that is likely to emerge in case of split. At least I made such conclusion from their blog post. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:03:29
Difficult to choose. Both exchanges are respectable enough and have good reviews from customers. I know that Coinbase has recently been down for several days, probably they had some issues. I am not sure if it is operating properly now.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:24:22
It depends on the exchange you use. Some exchanges have already informed the users about their plans for SegWit and possible split. Cex.io, for instance, promises to support any of the forks and split coins if it becomes necessary. They recently shared it on their blog.
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:45:34
Yeah, that's a wide-spread issue among the exchanges now, and mostly among the leaders. That makes sense, because they serve a huge number of users, both established and new. Sure, they are sometimes unable to cope with ever-increasing requests, especially at the market peak.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:24:04
I don't see any reasons for panic. According to the latest updates given by most exchanges, the coins will be split and new versions will be supported. Nothing extraordinary is going to happen. I keep my bitcoins on cex.io and I am not planning to withdraw them.
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:06:47
Why am I not that man? I wonder whether there are many luckies, who really became so rich with bitcoin through holding it since the very beginning. Or is it just a hook for newbies?
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:09:36
CEX.io is registered as Money Services Business and approved by FinCEN. They are legit and compliant with all necessary standards.
@_date: 2017-07-10 12:26:49
They serve different purposes. Exchanges exchange, wallets store. Wallet is just an interface that generates your keys and helps you with transactions. In case of exchanges it’s the place where you can store, trade and exchange your crypto for fiat. 
Need long-term storage - go for wallets;
Need flexibility while trading - go for exchanges.

I consider it a good thing for Bitcoin. It shows that Bitcoin is big and far from being a ponzi-scheme (as some unaware people consider it). It is up to you, whether to keep your private keys in the bank or not. I personally prefer not to. But still I’m glad that Bitcoin is expanding. I mean… Swiss Banks are the most reliable banks in the world. The fact that they accept Bitcoin can affect the whole cryptocurrency market in a very good sense.
