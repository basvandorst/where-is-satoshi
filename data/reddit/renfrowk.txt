It would be really cool if Dwolla could integrate with Bitcoin. I think it's a step in the right direction.

The difference between kidnapping and arrest is that when the state does it, it's called arrest.

I realize you're likely done with this awesome giveaway/action event, but I felt the need to contribute the little I could due to your incredible generosity.
As someone who suffers with Crohn's disease, I decided that it would be fitting to give back a little to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America for their work in advancing research towards cures for Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, their advocacy of people like me who suffer from these diseases, and other support networks they foster in the community.

Thanks for the reply. Yeah, I haven't really sat down and formulated a business model, just seems a bit pricey for me. In fact, I've never ordered cookies online in large part because of the high prices.
With the expenses you listed, it appears that your prices are fair (though as someone who has made a fair number of cookies, I have a hard time believing it costs ~$5-8 on ingredients for 12 cookies). Unfortunately they're just too high for me at this time.
I do wish you the best of luck though! =) Great idea. Perhaps I'll splurge and order some as a gift at some point.

yes, but are the *'s just obfuscated digits?

ah, ok. not sure how i've never heard of that before, but seems you lucked out with your id of BITCOIN.
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:56:41
I'm in the same situation. Account wasn't verified for ACH withdrawal and now am unable to upload an image of my ID.
I sent an email to support Have you heard anything from them or anyone else about how to proceed?

I'm sorry. I did not see that post and searched for the url of the youtube video before I posted. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:10:24
Same here. I never got the email from Bitfloor saying they were shut down and didn't know about it until I saw this thread. Got my BTC out just fine, but my USD is stuck for now since my account was not verified for ACH withdrawal.

I'm looking into using CapitalOne360 P2P to deposit into my bitfloor account and I had a question about fees. Bitfloor and CapitalOne360 seem to both say that there are no fees, but when I request a deposit of $50 at bitfloor they say I need to send $51.87. Do you have any idea what that extra $1.87 is for/from?

Thank you. Those were the words I was looking for. =)

It's the first time I've posted it (look at my submission history). I searched for the url of the youtube video before I posted and it wasn't posted to any subreddit.

Not saying I agree that "the twins" have any doing in this, but to address your question, people are saying basically the following:
1. Buy bitcoins
2. Price goes up, sell before bubble pops
3. DDoS leads to price crash
4. Buy back in at crash price
5. Long-term, price goes back up
Basically, by selling at the peak, forcing the crash, and buying back in after the crash, they have greatly increased their actual BTC holdings with the same amount of USD. Assuming they believe that Bitcoin will rise again in the long-term, it's highly profitable for someone in that position to force a crash.

Weird. I know it used to be free to register for an account.
Seems that they've temporarily disabled the free account registrations while they fix the spam filter.

Those coins I got last Oct at $10 are looking pretty nice right about now. Though, of course, it's not profits until I sell it.. and I don't intend to sell at the moment.

Seems to be down at the moment, but it was trucking along.

Cool idea, but seems a tad pricey. ~$15-20 for a dozen cookies. I could understand if you were shipping overnight, but it seems you're using USPS priority mail. How did you determine your price point?
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:03:51
You're not really making any money until you cash out. There's just the potential for profit.
