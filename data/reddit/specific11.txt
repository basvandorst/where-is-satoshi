As if I own enough btc to justify a hw wallet.

The world has changed. Maybe we should change with it.
Or not. Who knows?
Anyone who claims to have a definitive answer is probably wrong.

I turned in my bch for btc too early in the pump at ~940. I did not think shit would get as crazy as it did.

We used to have a Western Union at a small chain store I worked at for a few years. We would *always* tell customers the machine was down. The manager just looked the other way. We never used it even once. I wonder how corporate never noticed their machine didn't make any transactions for at least 5+ years...    
I'm only telling this story because saying "I dunno" is totally something I would do.

How worried *are* you? On a scale of 1 to a little?

No current btc wallets have a built in solution.

Ho Lee Shit
The fact that you are upvoted is crazy AF.
I'm not going to judge whether you are right or not, even if I had an opinion on that, I wouldn't share it.
That said, this is certainly a reflection on the type of person browsing this sub. Usually, financially oriented communities are very businesslike and politically correct. You could never say shit like that in a corporate environment. And here you are breaking like every HR rule ever, and people are (silently) agreeing. 
The times, they are a changin'...

The reason a dip is nothing to fear is that millions of poor people like me are waiting for one. There are several layers of price support that are unseen by most.
