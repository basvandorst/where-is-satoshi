It's only my opinion. But considering Bitcoin, the Blockchain, is a revolutionary concept and should be growing at exponential rates yet the price has been stuck in a trading range for years now, how is this not considered stagnating? Where is any mainstream adoption 8 years after its invention? I'm quite comfortable of my understanding of what Blockchain should be capable of. It seems other have lost that understanding.

That the market will resolve it and one day everyone will transact on the Blockchain, poor and rich, small payments and large payments. The article covers how it can do that moving forward.

So you judge a book by its cover? Give it a read it may give you some food for thought?

Things will happen in a ecosystem, theres still thousands of people who are here on this subreddit for example. However the key thing is everyone outside of here are not using it; are the changes focused on mainstream users eg the person on the street? People don't ask me about Bitcoin anymore (people used to in 2013), the average person still doesn't uses it. Until we start focusing on user needs, which is focusing once more on the Blockchain then Bitcoin will remain in a niche. Segwit and Lightening which I mention in the article will not bring any significant users into the ecosystem.
I'm not bothered about being a gazillionaire. I'm bothered about getting everyone to use Bitcoin and doing what it should be doing; changing the world. Instead its stuck outside the mainstream still 8 years after launch.
