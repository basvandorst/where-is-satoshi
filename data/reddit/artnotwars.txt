Haha I actually went to copy your spelling, and I wasn't sure if it was right or not so I googled it ��

Hahahaha damn it! That would have been fantastic!

I remember when I was a kid, I always dreamed of being able to send and receive money through the computer. This kid has grown up knowing that magic internet money exists in the form of bitcoin. When I was a kid, I would have thought that was cool as fuck and would have wanted some too.
Is it him that is Brainwashed, or is it the kids that want the newest shitty Chinese made toy that is on the market that are Brainwashed?

It would come in handy if you were travelling to a different country and wanted to use your bitcoin as spending money in your destination.

I sent a text to Gaddafi, but still no response.

You know some kids like to save their money right? I know kids that started saving their pocket money for a car as soon as they started getting pocket money. Also I'm sure the kid has heard, from his parents or elsewhere, how much bitcoin has increased in value. Kids aren't as dumb as you think.

Same. Fuck it, I'm going all in. I can't stand thinking about the 'what ifs' any more. Tomorrow I'm investing a large amount of money.

That still doesn't link it to you. So you withdraw $500 cash, buy a second hand iPhone from some guy on the internet, then he goes on a Vegas spending spree. Add infinite transactions between you and the Vegas party boy without it being banked, how would that be linked to you?

The one time you can't use that excuse is when you try to correct others and fail.

Shut your mouth, you're making us look bad. We have gun stores. I just drove past one yesterday.

I know benzo talk when I see it even through a computer screen. Definitely high af on Benzo's.

Awesome, Thank you man. So all these years I had it totally wrong. I always thought that the block size was the how much data had to be processed to mine a bitcoin. 
I'm going to prune the shit out all this wasted space. Introshine said above that a 'con' is that you have to download the entire chain once to be secure. Is this much of a con? haven't I already downloaded the whole chain once, hence the 97GB on my hard drive? Every time I open bitcoin core, don't I download the newest part of the chain anyway? I don't see how this could be a 'con' to pruning this extra data. 
Thanks again.

So obviously the less I decide to prune, the more secure I am?

Thanks for he explanation. I appreciate it.

Why liquid specifically? I've always had the theory that it is easier for people to dilute when it changes hands from dealer to dealer, to increase their profit margin. In general I have found tabs to be stronger.

"Person who provides information leading to the **arrest and conviction**"
It says it right there in the signed message.

Thanks for the reply mate.

When you say it re-verified the blocks, do you mean it had to 'synchronize with network' again? How long did that take?

Dude, your entire post history is talking about veganism in all different subreddits. Nobody wants to hear it. You're not converting anyone, you're just annoying.
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:17:07
Hahahaha never thought of it like that.

Ear mutilation? Seriously? I'm all for leaving baby dicks be, but to speak of ear piercing as if it is anywhere near the same thing as circumcision is a bit much.
