Ardor is a design that reminds a bit of sidechains. It's based on having everyday transactions on custom-purpose child chains, with one master chain to synchronize between them. It's meant to mitigate the problem of the main blockchain being bloated with irrelevant data.
It was designed for use in NXT and planned to be implemented in it soon. But like all new blockchain design concepts, it's possible it could be applied to Bitcoin as well in the future.

Like I said, if these two people are creators of Bitcoin, then they know full well that "transferring a note with the private keys" does *not* constitute a transfer. The original owner would still be in possession of the keys. Depositing coins in a fund can only mean sending them to an address controlled by the fund.

Starting from the end - if the check is triggered every 10 minutes, that is close enough to continuous for our purposes.
My simulation intends to answer a simple question: "Assume hashrate is constant and block finding follows a Poisson process with rate of 1 per 10 minutes. How long, on average, do I have to wait until I witness the event: 'in the past T hours, at least N blocks were found'?"
Specifically, for T=4 and N=48, my simulation (which is indeed similar in approach to btcee99's) shows that it will take about 4 years (more accurate figure coming soon). Note that you might have misinterpreted it slightly - it doesn't generate "48-block sequences". It generates a single continuous sequence of blocks, and checks every 48-block subsequence for T&lt;4 hours. If found, it also includes a reset to prevent the same anomaly from being double-counted.
Gavin's code - and apparently you as well - assumes this question can be answered trivially by calculating "4 hours, divided by the probability that a given span of 4 hours will have at least 48 blocks" (resulting in an answer of &gt;50 years). But this calculation actually answers a different question: "Assume I divide future time to neat, disjoint intervals of 4 hours. How long will I have to wait until one of those intervals will have at least 48 blocks?". Of course, I will have to wait longer, because this is a special case - there could be a 4-hour span with &gt;=48 blocks that crosses the boundaries of the neat intervals, so it would finish my search in the first case, but not in the second case. (Note that this is exactly equivalent to dividing to neat, disjoint sequences of 48 blocks).
The bottom line is that with the alarm code is written, even if hashrate doesn't increase, the alarm will trigger every 4 years rather than every 50 years. Thus, it's touchier than we intended.
I'll point out again that I don't know of a way to figure out the question we really care about symbolically. It's not a trivial question. So for now we're stuck with simulations, but I'm working on methods to accelerate the simulations to get more accurate results (using importance sampling etc.)
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:39:13
Yes, the time to find a block follows the exponential distribution. The chance you will find a block in less than half the target time is 1-exp(-0.5) = 39.35%.
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:38:20
I've added some explanations to my parent comment.
The gist is that Gavin tried to subdivide time to neat 4-hour spans, and calculate the chance the event would happen in each span. So he's multiplying the probability per span with the number of spans, which is a low number, so he arrives at a low probability (that is, a high number of years).
In your original calculation, you went to the other extreme - multiply by the number of 10-minute spans, under the assumption that we check the condition after every block. This resulted in a low number of years.
As you correctly noted, the correleation between overlapping spans means the actual number of years is higher.
I don't know how to calculate the real number analytically. But we can simulate it.
(The pdf/cdf issue is minor in comparison)
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:39:47
I'm not sure I understand what you mean here.
Edit: Ok, I think I get it now. I didn't try to suggest something else to look at (e.g. something based on historical hashrate growth). I just took what Gavin sought - an alarm threshold that should trigger once in 50 years if hashrate is constant - and showed that he didn't choose the correct threshold, and the threshold he used will trigger every 4 years instead. Sorry to disappoint if you thought I was doing something more clever.
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:21:23


That's one possibility but I think it's inferior to choosing a more appropriate threshold for the current schedule, for two reasons:
1. I think a continuous test has better discernment power. That is, we want to minimize false positives while maximizing detection of abnormal events. I believe (though haven't yet proven) that sampling more rarely will result in a worse tradeoff between these - with a fixed false positive rate of 1/50 years, you'll detect less hashrate spikes.
2. I'm not sure changing the testing interval is that easy - it's not enough to run the test every 4 hours, you need to do it in the correct times - otherwise different clients can report different things (and the collection of all clients will fall back to continuous sampling). This means you'll also have to worry about what happens if you miss your scheduled test - either you put extra code to sample a past interval, or you risk being oblivious if your client happened to be offline at the exact minute of the sampling.

It's not. I've added an explanation to the parent comment.
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:00:57
Only if we let the threshold be hardcoded. Trying to calculate it in-place (as it is now) would be too tricky at the moment.
If you replace the following line:
    else if (p &lt;= alertThreshold &amp;&amp; nBlocks &gt; BLOCKS_EXPECTED)
    else if (nBlocks &gt;= 52)
Then with constant hashrate it should trigger about once every 50 years. (More accurate estimates coming soon.)
I see the code also tries to alert when the blocks found are less than expected. This also requires fixing if we want it to happen every 50 years in normal conditions.
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:20:52
I didn't say there wasn't a bug in Gavin's code - there are two bugs, the cdf thing and the subdivision thing. I just said the part that he assumes constant hashrate isn't a bug.
You're right, the cdf thing isn't negligible - after I wrote my original comments I took a look at the numbers and saw there was more of a difference than I thought, so I softened my comments up a bit. Basically I knew that the ratio approaches 1 for large x, and assumed our x is large enough. I was wrong about that. It's still a more minor issue than the subdivision thing, though.
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:58:07
There are many pitfalls to watch out for here, but the main one is - the normal approximation here is simply inadequate. It works ok for values of the variable reasonably close to the mean, but degrades in quality for extreme values (which is exactly what we're looking at here).
If you work with the Poisson distribution directly you will get a better match.

The thing is, an elastic block cap requires penalizing miners somehow. Greg suggests penalizing the effort required, but I think requiring them to pay is more direct. The question is - pay to where? Without a rollover pool, there's nowhere for him to pay.
As clarified by Giszmo, in this suggestion, the rollover pool is used only for miner penalties, not for transaction fees. I agree that paying fees to the rollover pool is an independent modification that should be discussed separately. But conveniently, if we implement a rollover pool for one use, it will be easier to implement the other.

This reeks of a hoax. Nothing in these "leaked" documents seems even remotely consistent with Satoshi's style.
I find the following especially dubious: "I, Dave Kleiman have received 1,100,111 Bitcoin from Craig Wright". There is no record on the blockchain of Satoshi's bitcoins having been transferred, and of course they wouldn't be foolish enough to consider sharing of private keys as "transfer". Also, it makes no sense whatsoever that Satoshi would deposit his coins in a "trust".

As I said, we should prevent miners from leeching, meaning that leeching is an abnormal state - I didn't claim miners are by default leeches.
Leeching means consuming more resources than you are giving back. If a miner, for his own personal gain, includes a transaction that is worth less than what it costs the network to process it, then he is a leech. Block limits prevent this.
@_date: 2015-06-04 09:08:13
Gavin's point was that, historically, the drop in number of nodes resulted from the advent of SPV clients and not from an increase in block size. As I replied, this is correct but also completely irrelevant.

No, what I calculated is the same thing Gavin tried to - how rarely the alarm will trigger if the hashrate (and hence, lambda) is constant. If hashrate increases significantly, the alarm will more likely trigger and alert us to this fact.

1) The post isn't just a copy-paste of the Monero system. It includes:
a. Analysis of the problem and solution
b. Making the idea applicable to Bitcoin, by using a rollover pool
c. A better penalty function (IMO anyway)
d. Renewed discussion about the idea, with which many people were previously unfamiliar
So even if I had known about the Monero system, the post would still be valid, with the only difference being a note that there is something similar in Monero.
2) It's not reasonable to expect me to be familiar with the system in each and every alt. It's also difficult to search for it when I'm using different terminology from Monero. A search for "Cryptocurrency elastic block limit" doesn't find Monero in the first page.

I'm not sure you understood what my claim is.
I'm assuming the network condition is sampled in a continuous or at least frequent way. I can't tell for sure if the alarm mechanism is triggered continuously or not since I don't know who is calling the function I looked at.
What I'm saying is that if the alarm is sampled continuously, then with a threshold of 48 it will trigger every ~4 years, not every 50 years.
The alarm won't be issued multiple times because there is additional code that makes sure there is at most 1 alarm per day.
    if (lastAlertTime &gt; now-60*60*24) return; // Alert at most once per day
The same event won't trigger multiple times in my simulation either because I have also included a provision to prevent that, as explained in my parent comment.
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:42:56
It's a feature, not a bug. The rarity calculation assumes constant rate, so that if the alarm is triggered, we know that the hashrate has increased significantly.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:34:45
The miner collects the fees for every transaction he includes. He will include a transaction as long as its fee is higher than the *marginal* penalty for including it (given by the derivative of the penalty function).
As the blocks get fuller, the marginal penalty per tx increases, and miners will demand higher fees from transactions.

Maybe we have different definitions for "credit"? As I said, I have no problem mentioning in the post that CryptoNote has a similar system - in an academic paper it would be a bibliographic reference. And [I just did]( - I was in no particular rush to do so, since as you said yourself, this fact already appears right there in one of the first comments. (Also, I wanted to spend more time examining the Monero system before making this "official".)
But I won't say anything along the lines of "Thank you to CryptoNote for devising the idea which inspired this thread". Because it didn't.
I can't prove I didn't know about it, but I'm not sure why that matters. Furthermore, if I had known about it, it wouldn't have really been a good strategy for me to pretend otherwise.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:16:09
Clearing the pool will behave more or less as in the original post, yes. The simplest way is that each block, the miner gets a specific percentage of the current pool. One difference is that instead of 20% as in the original idea, a more appropriate value here would be 1%.
The pool shouldn't back up. The rate at which it clears is proportional to its current size, and the rate at which it can fill is essentially bounded, so it will reach an equilibrium.
I believe we should ease up on our aversion to hard forking changes. The original Bitcoin protocol is 2008 technology, it needs to move forward to survive. If needed, though, we can design the functions so they will require less parameter adjustments.
@_date: 2015-06-07 19:41:30

1. The only authority users have with your proposal, is to switch to a different software which does not have your suggested miner voting. I agree this is in fact the ultimate authority, but if we go with that, why include miner voting in the first place?
2. Miners want high fees. Users want low fees. Like in any other market. You are confusing "miners don't want people to stop using Bitcoin altogether" with "miners and users want exactly the same thing and they will happily frolic together in the open green fields".
3. When you optimize one value, other values suffer. Miners want to maximize their profit - everything else, including user satisfaction, is just a means to an end. What maximizes profit is not the same thing as what maximizes user satisfaction.
 
 In every single market, manufacturers want consumer to keep using the product, and yet giving manufacturers the ability to enforce anti-competitive laws is *bad*. Why do you think this is any different? It's like you're assuming there's some strangely unique synergy in Bitcoin between miners and users. There's not.
4. I did not say anything even remotely resembling "max profit is at infinite block size", so I would appreciate it if you stop with the strawman arguments. I didn't say max profit is when block limit is so low nobody uses Bitcoin, either.
 
 What I did say: There is a block limit optimal for users. There is a block limit optimal for nodes. There is a block limit optimal for miners. These are all different, and the optimum for one group will be less-than-optimal for the other groups. We should strive for a compromise between all the different needs. Letting just one group decide is perverse.
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:27:07
... And an easier time to run nodes, making the sure the network remains decentralized.
FWIW, given the choice between sticking with 1MB and increasing to 20MB, I'm for increasing to 20MB. But there are two sides of the debate, and each side should respect the arguments of the other.
Anyway, the point of my post is that an elastic cap will make for a better system, regardless of which size is chosen. The elastic cap is not a replacement for a size bump.
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:20:59
I'll add a note about related research. I won't credit them for the idea, because I came up with the idea independently.
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:54:59
Do you recognize the fact that if Craig used any of the above methods to "transfer" the coins to Dave, then Dave is *not* in full control of the coins? That Craig could, at any moment, take the coins back to himself, using the same private keys? And that in light of this, Dave would never consider these coins as deposited with him, or offer any commitments in their regard?
Unless, of course, Dave promptly used the keys to swipe the coins to his own address. Which, again, we see no evidence for in the blockchain.
What Bitcoin is *all about* is using the blockchain as a ledger to prevent double-spending, overcoming the inherent insecurity of simply sharing information. It is not reasonable that Satoshi would eschew all of that - and in a humongous transfer of 1M Bitcoins, no less.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:47:57
Decentralized, of course. It's just a number in the Bitcoin network that can be calculated deterministically from the blocks. You can think of it as an extra field in the block, specifying the current size of the pool. In each block, the miner collects 1% of the pool; and if his block is too large, he pays into the pool.
Technically, it will require a change in how generation transactions work. Currently, the outputs on the gen tx must total no more than minted coins (currently 25 BTC) + tx fees in the block. With this suggestion, the outputs of the gen tx must total no more than minted coins + tx fees + 1% of current pool - penalty for large block. Each node can independently figure out the pool size at any block, by totaling the (penalty - collection) for all previous blocks.

Can you explain? A vote by actual use of the system seems fairest to me (BDD might not be a perfect proxy, but it's a start). It's no more "by the wealthy" than a vote by miners.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:41:30
Yes, but that's very difficult to do. It's a general problem in the current protocol that fees are not paid out to nodes. I hope something along the lines of the [red balloons paper]( can solve this problem.
@_date: 2015-06-07 10:36:06
Yes, for a given penalty function, if mining is more centralized blocks will be bigger. Assuming we have a target block size, the centralization will affect our choice of function - not the other way around. (That is, if mining is more centralized we will have to choose a tighter bound).
Interestingly, this means that supersized blocks can serve as an indication that mining is centralized. Right now we have no real way to know if mining is centralized or not (other than voluntary reports by the centralized entities).

The rollover pool *is* deferring (though there may be many ways to defer).
I'm not talking here about rolling tx fees over, as I did in the 2012 suggestion. I'm simply talking about taking the blocksize penalty out of the miner's reward and into the pool, and then giving future miners extra reward out of the pool.
The miner needs to pay the same penalty for every transaction he includes, regardless of whether there is a fee for it or not. There is no advantage for the miner to accept a fee out-of-band. So the particular criticism you've raised is simply false.
Anyway, I was not aware of Monero's system when I wrote the post. Now that I am, the main issue I have with it is the choice of function.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:53:29
There's no minimum block size now either.
Your scenario is not likely, because it only takes one miner to include all of the transactions that the cartel skipped.
If the cartel is a majority of the network, and it excludes all blocks not belonging to itself, then it's not a cartel at all, it's a malicious attacker with &gt;50% hashrate doing a DoS attack. It's possible this attack can be resolved with DAGs, but that's still subject to research.

The claim is that Craig = Satoshi and Dave = his friend which agreed to hold Craig's money for him.
But if Craig "gave" his money to Dave to hold, and then use the keys he kept to take the money back, and then blame Dave and request compensation for the loss... That would be theft.
But that's besides the point. It simply makes no sense whatsoever that they would go through this whole legal document and complicated repayment scheme *when the coins remain under Craig's control*.

Because the miner that collects the fees for txs, does not bear the full cost of his block's size. The whole network does, and he must be penalized for it.

Do I understand correctly that with this proposal, miners have the ultimate authority to determine what the block limit will be?
That would be ill-advised. Miners have their own interests which are not completely aligned with those of the nodes and the users; we should not give this single group complete power.
Depending on the demand curve for transactions, miners may want to reduce the limit so that tx fees will go higher, resulting in greater revenues. But that is of course against the needs of the users.
A voting mechanism makes it very easy for miners to collude. Normally, it would be difficult for miners to be anti-competitive, because each individual miner acts according to his own interest rather than that of the group (tragedy of the commons). But there's no risk in *voting* in favor of a rule that, when applied to everyone, works in the interest of the group. (There are real-world examples of industry players lobbying for laws that restricted their entire industry, because that ended up increasing their profits.)
Alternatively, the demand curve may be such that miners will want to increase the limit, to increase transaction volume and revenues. But that will make things harder for the nodes. There is currently no mechanism to incentivize nodes, so they rely on the protocol rules to look after their interests. This is betrayed if we let miners set the rules.
I agree completely that we should start small to set a precedent that we can upgrade the technology. But this proposal, as it currently stands, is anything but.
I suggest we scratch the provision for future upgrades, and simply reexamine this at a later time when we have a better understanding of the problem and possible solutions.

If a majority of miners want to reject a transaction, they would have to consistently reject blocks that are legitimate according to Bitcoin protocol. That is a very visible and serious infraction. Bitcoin nodes can then try to reject these miners' block.


That will not be very stable, because miners are not a monolithic entity. If a group tries to limit the blocks, the optimal strategy for each individual in the group would be to defect. A single miner on his own does have an effect on the fees, but only a small one.
But a voting mechanism changes everything. Because the miners don't have to self-enforce a limit and hope others will follow. They can just vote on a rule that will force everyone to comply.


Not really, the economic majority of users have the ultimate authority, by choosing which network to use.
Giving more legislative power to the miners would be a bad thing.


 
That's a breach of what people signed up to when they started using Bitcoin. It's not going to happen, anything with this change will not be Bitcoin. It has nothing to do with the voting power of miners, a change that increases reward to 100 BTC/block would be similarly impossible.


"The miners" are not a monolithic entity. Each miner will prefer that the other miners run nodes.
This will probably result in ~3 big mining groups running nodes; nobody can start a node because the blocks are too big and they receive no funding for it, and nobody can become a miner because they can't run a node (and the big miners won't let him use theirs). Centralization.
@_date: 2015-06-14 09:12:59


I agree there are some practical issues to figure out. But in theory, if users as a group realize that a miner has gone rogue, they can reject his blocks (identified either by origin, or by the infractions themselves). Then they can trade freely on the network of honest miners, and the rogue miner will not be able to sell his coins, wasting his mining effort.


There is some subtlety here, but the protocol says "accept the longest branch which follows the protocol". A Litecoin node won't accept a Bitcoin branch even if it has more work. Likewise, if a majority miner consistently rejects blocks which are themselves legitimate, he is not following the protocol and this is a first strike, a casus belli of sorts, that gives honest users and miners the right to reject his blocks.


Any change that significantly alters the inflation schedule must be rejected, even if the total remains the same. Minor corrections are ok (e.g., a PI controller for difficulty that guarantees a "halving every 4 years" regardless of changes in hashrate. )


That is exactly what we're trying to prevent. Barrier of entry for both mining and running a node must be sufficiently low.

If you're talking about a miner creating spam on purpose, that's not the primary problem we're trying to solve (since there's little incentive for miners to do that).
If you're talking about ordinary user transactions, then that's similar to the original application for which I introduced a rollover pool, however
1. It doesn't eliminate the problem, because even if 90% of the fee is shared, it could still be the case that low-fee transactions are accepted.
2. There's a potential issue of out-of-band payments, where users pay the miner outside of the built-in tx fee mechanism to include their tx.
@_date: 2015-06-04 09:05:50
Right, removing the penalty from circulation is possible, and in theory it would appreciate all bitcoin holdings, however:
1. This creates systematic monetary deflation, and as such is an essential economic change (of the same sort of "making more than 21M coins") and thus should not be done in Bitcoin.
2. Even if we agree to make a change of this magnitude, I think the overall macroeconomic effect of this deflation will be for the worse. How a non-inflationary currency like Bitcoin will play out is already suspect, we don't want to magnify the issue.

Right. My goal was to make the problem more like what I thought it was before I read Mike's post. There still is a problem.
I do think, though, that it takes an important sting out of the problem, giving us more time to discuss, and more advance warning when things become critical. e.g., we can wait until blocks are obviously too full, and then everyone will agree to increase the limit - without going through a crisis.

Followup, with the recent addition to the document in mind.
I'm all for mechanisms to let the market decide. But a market functions properly only when certain conditions are met. Among other things, it requires consumers to pay for what they consume, producers to be compensated for what they produce, and to have no artificial barriers to increasing supply.
These conditions are not satisfied by the Bitcoin network, and they will be even less so if the voting mechanism is implemented. In such bad conditions, I think design-by-internet-flame-wars might actually be better than the "market".
On one side of this you have the nodes, which currently have no way to charge for their services. We want it to be easy to run nodes to keep the network decentralized, so we want to limit the size of blocks. A committee can do this. The market of miners, probably not.
On the other side you have the users, who want to transact on the network with competitive fees. In normal markets, if prices go too high, it becomes profitable to increase production, and any entrepreneur is free to do so. But here we want to enable a vote to impose an artificial rule that limits supply. Fees can inflate arbitrarily, and nobody can produce more block space in response.
Think about how such a thing would play out in any other market. Let's say manufacturers of cellphones would be able to vote on a rule that limits the total number of cellphones that can be produced around the world. They would choose a number much lower than the number of devices today; prices would skyrocket, as will the profits. Luckily, in most markets, nobody would even consider giving the industry players such power.
The size of the effect depends on the necessity of the product in question, but it is always true that lack of competition is good for the producers, and bad for the consumers.
In our case, the miners won't choose a limit so low that people will stop using Bitcoin altogether, but they will choose a limit that will force people to pay much more than they objectively should.
Jeff suggests that public scrutiny and stake in Bitcoin's health would keep miners in check, but that is as ineffective as it would be in any other market. Notably, voting on limits would not require any explicit collusion or overt attacks.
Perhaps the time scales involved in the voting would mitigate this, and perhaps this is really the "lesser of evils" after all... But to me, letting the cat guard the cream, and giving a single group the power to decide in an ecosystem consisting of several groups, is a bad start.
I think the best overall plan is to have hardcoded parameters, chosen with bargaining and debates like the current one, as part of a system that minimizes the sensitivity to the choice (e.g. [my proposal here]( or other ideas).
If not, another idea (not sure if suggested before, might warrant its own discussion): Vote by Bitcoin days destroyed. Let users configure their choice in the client, and mark it in their transactions. This way we can make a vote based on the desires of the people actually using the system.

Externalties. The payment for including a transaction is to the one miner who includes it. The cost of processing the transaction is borne by the entire network. So we have to design the protocol to limit greedy miners' ability to be leeches.
In your plane analogy, the cost of operating the plane is borne by the specific flight company, not by all flight companies. So it makes sense for them to have bigger planes, so they can fly more passengers, and no one is in the right to tell them otherwise (ignoring safety concerns etc.)
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:20:39
Right, of course. That was a simple typo I've now fixed (in the calculation I did of course use 48).
@_date: 2015-12-27 15:40:39
I'm pretty sure the "50 years" figure is incorrect, and the correct figure is 4 years.
This is hard to calculate analytically because of how things correlate, but I've run some simulations, and I got an average of 4 years between occurrences of the event "In the past 4 hours, at least 48 blocks were found". The error of the estimate is ~10% (I can run more extensive simulations for a more accurate figure). To prevent the same lucky period from being double-counted, I treated as separate only occasions that are at least 100 blocks apart (because of the rarity of the event, there shouldn't be significant false negatives).
 This is all assuming, of course, fixed hashrate and an ideal Poisson Process with rate of 1 per 10 minutes.
ETA (after reading some comments): I was referred to the code that is responsible for triggering the alarm, and I can see where Gavin's code is going wrong. There are two issues, a minor one and a major one.
The minor issue is that it uses the pdf rather than cdf - the value calculated is the chance of exactly 48 blocks, rather than at least 48 blocks which is more relevant.
The major issue is that the code assumes we subdivide time to neat, disjoint spans of 4 hours, and figures out how long it would take to get a span with 48 blocks. But in reality there are no disjoint spans, at any point in time the alarm system can look at the past 4 hours and see if there are 48 blocks. So if we take a period of 50 years and subdivide it, there will be on average 1 neat span with 48 blocks. But there will be ~10 more 4-hour spans which cross the borders of our subdivision and have 48 blocks.
At another extreme, we could say that every block gives us another opportunity to look at the past 4 hours. This would give us an average of one event per 2 years (50/24). But that's not right either because the events are correlated, so we'd be counting the same lucky streak multiple times.
The correct value is somewhere in between, and currently I don't know how to calculate it analytically. I can simulate it, and as mentioned the result is about once every 4 years.
I should clarify one more thing: The code tries (in an incorrect way, but still) to calculate how rare would be such a lucky streak - under the assumption that hashrate is constant. That is a feature, not a bug. If hashrate is increasing of course this event will be more common. That's what the alarm is trying to do - we are encountering something which was unlikely based on just random variation, so there may be another factor (such as a massive hashrate increase) which we should watch out for.
ETA2: Another point to consider - since the alarm is triggered by the number of blocks, which is discrete, we can never reach a threshold which will give a rarity of exactly 50 years. One threshold will give significantly more than 50 years, the next will give significantly less.
So even if the code is fixed, we shouldn't take the "50 years" constant in it at face value.
If the code is changed so that instead of looking at number of blocks in the past 4 hours, we look at the amount of time of the last X blocks, the parameter is continuous so we can choose a threshold that will give exactly 50 years.

You'd need to replace the rollover pool with something. The most obvious would be to remove coins from circulation, but this has harmful macroeconomic implications, and doesn't even completely solve the problem.
But - after thinking about this some more, I've realized the issue is less severe, and much more complicated, than I initially thought. See the current analysis here -

It's a feature, not a bug. The alarm should trigger whenever something happens that is very rare under the assumption of constant rate. If it triggers, we know that probably the hashrate has increased drastically (or something else is going on), and we should watch out.
Of course, because of the error in Gavin's calculation, it's a bit more sensitive than we'd like.

And then? The users can complain all they want, but if they need the service they'll use it, even with inflated prices.


That does not work in any other market, and it won't here. Users want low fees, miners have high fees, and miners will have the power to set fees much higher than should be.


I have no idea what you are referring to. The dynamic block size I mentioned obviously does take the market into account, and it was given just as an example for a general concept (not because it applies to the issue at hand). Vote by BDD was more of an afterthought, but it also obviously lets the market of actual users decide. I don't recall proposing any other automatic systems. In case you are referring to elastic block cap, it's not an "automatic system" and it has a very specific purpose, which will remain valid even if your plan is accepted.


Gavin can't force anyone to use his code. Users have the final say of which code to run, as they should have.


Voting enables producers to enforce anti-competitive laws, so there is no free market.


It's not. And it's the lesser of all evils. You assume the free market will just magically solve everything even when it is denied the rules of engagement required for it to work. It won't.
If you can come up with a system that lets the market decide *where all interested parties have a say*, then we may have something to talk about. Until then - it's clear we won't be able to convince one another, so let's agree to disagree.
@_date: 2015-06-14 09:35:47


Why not?
Bitcoin is unlike most other markets. In most markets, there are physical limits on resources, and the market finds out how to be most productive under these limits.
In Bitcoin, everything is abstract and ruled by consensus. Limitations are placed artificially to make sure the system isn't gamed. For the same reasons we have hardcoded rules for inflation schedule and time between blocks, we could have hardcoded rules for the block size.
We should strive for rules that are flexible and dynamic, reducing the sensitivity to parameter choice. But that doesn't mean we should just put whatever automatic system we can think of. This can result in far worse things than the central planning risk.
e.g., I proposed once [a system for dynamically choosing time between blocks]( This would give more power in the decision to market forces. But there were missing pieces of the puzzle, and without them resolved the proposal is dangerous, so I'm not actively promoting it, we're fine with hardcoded rules. (And I do hope that eventually, the hardcoded rules will be that we have GHOST and reduce to 5-sec blocks).
So yes, I do propose a new static size for the time being (and a better mechanism in the future). It's not perfect, but better than letting miners vote.
PS: As in my other comment, I also suggest considering "vote by Bitcoin days destroyed".


Miners will choose whatever maximizes their profit. They will keep Bitcoin still usable; but at much higher fees than are justified, resulting in Bitcoin being much less useful to humanity than it should have been.


Voting on a self-serving block size does not require an explicit collusion or overt attack. If miners are thinking long-term, they will be happy to vote on a rule that will increase their profits in a few months.

No... Drag has a quadratic component. If you move your arms down fast and then move them up slow, the drag you created on the down motion is greater than the drag you cancelled on the up motion. Together, you've increased drag.
e.g you move down with speed 2 over 1 sec, and up with speed 1 over 2 sec. Then drag created is 2^2 * 1 - 1^2 * 2 = 2.

There's a tragedy of the commons issue. "Miners" are not a monolithic entity, there are many miners. A miner can only set his own soft limit, which may not be wise since it doesn't affect what others do. But it may be wise of him to vote for a limit that is enforced on everyone.

I think you're right. A bigger miner benefits proportionally more from the externality of rollover rewards, and thus has less to lose from the penalty and can afford to include more txs.
On the other hand, including more txs reduces scarcity of block space and the average fee paid. This effects a bigger miner more. I think the two effects partially cancel out.

A limit isn't strictly necessary, but it's good to have so that nodes can know what is the most they have to endure. Also, even without a hard limit, you don't want a function which is too wide, since it might fail to find fees that make sense. It's better to restrict it to a narrower range, parameterized by a value that replace the role of a limit.

0) I do believe it's best to use separate comments to ask different questions.
1) The GBA has no official policy on this issue, but we can share our individual views.
I think Proof of Stake is a good conceptual approach aspiring to solve a real problem. However, I don't believe that any of the concrete manifestations of this idea that have been proposed so far really work (not without additional research at least), and I don't believe much thought has been put into the currently available PoS-based coins.
2) I believe that Bitcoin is not just Bitcoin, but rather the whole world of cryptocurrencies. Talks about alt coins shouldn't be discriminated against if the coin, the topic and the speaker are all good. Is any of the currently existing alt coins good enough to warrant a keynote talk? Probably not.
3) I don't know of any such cultural attachment.

There are actually additional sources of variance that interact in complex ways depending on the window length, miner hashrate, and the period of time over which you do the measurements. If you mine over a short period you get a stronger effect from the window size (which might be what you observed). I'll try to do a more detailed profiling but for now, if I'm not mistaken, assuming the window is not excessively short and that we're mining over a long period, the relative variance is roughly
1 / (HNT) + 1 / (hNDT)
Where h is the miner's % of network hashrate, H is the pool's %, N is the average number of blocks per day, D is the number of shares per block and T is the period of time.
Assuming p2pool as-implemented would, of course, necessitate exploring all the details of how it is implemented - which I doubt are really relevant.

The GBA has no official policy on this issue, but we can share our individual views.
I believe that raising the block limit (by some yet unknown amount) is inevitable. In general, looser bounds make running a node difficult, while tighter bounds drive people into using off-chain solutions relying on a 3rd party. Right now we are way too much on the tight side of things.
As you say, miners have an incentive not to take action that would destroy their livelihood. Given the importance of raising the block limit, miners will comply eventually. I don't know about "easy", but it will happen.
Also, it is a common myth that ultimately miners are the ones who get to decide on protocol changes. Miners mine to gain value out of the bitcoins they generate, so ultimately the bargaining power is at the hands of those who give the coins value - the choice will be made by the economic majority.

There is an option to pay with Bitcoin. But denominating the ticket price in Bitcoin is not practical. If BTC rate goes up x4, will we charge the equivalent of $1,000 for a ticket? If it goes down, will we take a huge loss on the organization?
And if we change the BTC price according to the rate... Then you go back to having a dollar-denominated price.
Despite everything that is wrong with the US dollar, it still has a more stable purchasing power than Bitcoin.

Going forward it will not be practical for individuals to run a full node, so this seems to hurt individual miners rather than pools, aggravating the problem.

The reserve is the bottleneck, in the sense that a typical's pool reserve is too low to offer PPS with reasonable fees, so it offers a risk-free method such as PPLNS instead. For this scenario, miners can simply [mine in multiple pools to reduce variance]( which is ok for now and requires no action by pools (maybe that's the solution we should push?) but I don't think that's sustainable long-term. Variance (which is more often talked about) and fees are mirror images - Multi-PPS will allow PPS simplicity and no-variance with the low fees they know from PPLNS pools. (In the same way that normal mining in multiple pools allows reducing variance to near-PPS levels).
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:43:38
1) It's been a while since I've considered p2pool in depth, but I don't think this is correct. There are two kinds of variance, pool-variance and share-variance. The one that concerns small miners is share-variance, and that is not affected by the length of the window you use to compute rewards.
Think of it like 1/a + 1/b (a is the miner hashrate and b is the window length), you can increase b all you want but as long as a is small you won't get a small number.
To help small miners you need to make atomic shares smaller, in traditional pools that's no problem because of the direct miner/pool connection, in p2pool it causes network latency issues.
Increasing the window does reduce variance for large miners, but it comes at the cost of more time to wait to get the reward.

Of course, big players have their impact too; as well as not-so-big players who nevertheless understand the market more than most of us.
Because you never know who may be tricking you, consistency is key. Don't let the day-to-day fluctuations get to you. Decide what you want to do and stick with it - in the long term, the fluctuations and manipulations don't last, but Bitcoin's growth does.
2) I don't know if Bitcoin has the power to end wars.
But the fact that we quote the value of a bitcoin in USD is a non-issue. It just so happens that currently, USD and similar currencies are very liquid and have a relatively stable purchasing power short-term, so it is convenient to measure the purchasing power of a bitcoin in USD. We could just as well have measured it in quarts of milk or bags of Cheetos. But going forward, we will see more and more often that it makes sense to simply denominate prices in BTC.

1) P2pool is neat but you're giving it much more credit than it deserves. Shares in the p2pool are essentially blocks in a virtual blockchain, and it has the same effect on variance reduction as reducing the time between blocks. If shares are frequent you have the same network latency problems as with short blocks, and if they are infrequent you haven't reduced variance much so individual miners would be out of the picture.
If you take the idea of p2pool, think how to make it work and follow it to its logical conclusion, you'll arrive at Multi-PPS. This is more streamlined and while it does have the concept of pools, they do not have the built-in tendency to grow large and centralized.
Perfect is the enemy of the good, and we should focus on practical solutions, rather than impossibly idealized ones.
2) I'm not sure why you think eliminating ASICs could be good. We're used to thinking about CPUs as commodity, but in fact they are incredibly complex pieces and there are only 2 companies producing consumer desktop CPUs (likewise for GPUs). If Bitcoin grew large enough and was CPU-friendly, we'd see a point where Intel and AMD concentrate all mining within themselves, without anyone else having a chance to compete. It is much better to have a simple function, that anyone can design an ASIC for. We're still in the transitional period, but going forward SHA-256 computation will be a commodity.
3) "Variance", not "Varience".

2. Ok. The reason I asked is that this post already discusses the earlier idea of load-balancing (it doesn't call it that), so it seemed weird to highlight it as obviating Multi-PPS.

The heated debate on Bitcoin's scalability and governance roadmaps hasn't quieted down, so to follow up on our successful [panel event]( we're holding a round table event. It will feature a series of short lectures presenting the issues, followed by multiple discussion groups which will explore the issues.
We will compile a summary document of the discussions, and translate it to English for the benefit of the international community. Hopefully, we will be able to come up with some new solutions and insights.
@_date: 2016-03-04 14:05:45
Well... I did try to clarify it's just a short story rather than a new paper or some breakthrough.
I have some good news though - Aviv *does* have a breakthrough new discovery that should blow your mind. He hasn't published the paper yet (though he did give some talks about it) but it is my understanding he should do so soon. Stay tuned...
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:11:17
Of course should and shouldn't is relevant. It's important to have defenses, but it's also important to make sure nobody wants to attack.
EDIT: Oh F. I had a significant Typo. I've fixed it now. I was disagreeing with you and saying that should/shouldn't is relevant, for the reason specified in the second part.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:49:56
Of course you can use the old rules, if you find like-minded users and miners who will run a separate chain together with you.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:45:22
I don't condone such attacks in either direction. If BU want to go fork themselves (*responsibly*), they can go ahead.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:34:42
You should probably ask them that. They want to destroy the minority chain and admit as much. They claim that if they don't do it the market will be confused. But an alternative explanation is that they simply want to destroy the competition.
It's like Coca-Cola hiring assassins and sending them to the HQ of Pepsi Cola, instead of using the same money to produce more cola. It might be a better business decision, but it's not an acceptable moral decision.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:48:12
Yes. In one case the minority can continue operating with their own chain, in another case they cannot.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:22:35


Nope. The Core chain wouldn't try to mine on the BU chain anyway (it's a hard fork), and if BU decides to actively attack them, there's nothing they can do to continue running their protocol.


I think this is adequately answered by my assertion that as long as people have the ability to work on the protocol of their choice, it's fine.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:40:22
Ok, note that the second one (which I've linked now) does have subtitles (it was individual talks rather than a panel, thus much easier to transliterate). So if you haven't watched it already, now is the time!

That's a strawman. I agree with all of that. We will get all of that and more (confirmation in seconds, fee of less than a cent for small payment) once we have SegWit and Micropayment-channel-based solutions like LN.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:06:37
I'm not talking about just "mining empty blocks". I'm talking about mining empty blocks and purposefully orphaning other blocks, in a way that no transaction can be included in a block ever.
This is a variant of the well-known "&gt;50% attack". If you have more hashrate than the rest of the network, you can effectively "erase" any blocks that do not belong to you.
What they talked about is the more sophisticated "Selfish mining", which allows you to erase blocks even without majority hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:02:39


They need to mine their own blocks on their own chain. They just need to make sure they are ignoring the majority chain.
If they accidentally try to mine blocks on the larger chain, of course they will be orphaned, but that's their fault...
I agree that it's not perfectly pure because they will need to add a checkpoint, which is a kind of a protocol change, but it's a technical one, not a fundamental one.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:08:25
If you've been following my views on this, you know that keeping only one version of the Bitcoin blockchain is not high on my priority list.
@_date: 2015-05-06 21:26:01
1. I didn't say anywhere that I invented smart mining. I said it's a requirement for Multi-PPS, and that it's not ubiquitous and thus requires explanation. Perhaps the distinction got a little blurred in the interview transcription. Relatedly, I mentioned Eligius as a pool that already uses multiple outputs in the generation transaction, though apparently it didn't make it to the final version posted (the actual interview was much longer).
2. Have you read the [Multi-PPS forum post]( Load balancing as a way to reduce variance is an idea I invented, in AoBPMRS at first and then in a forum post. Multi-PPS is a step forward, not back. You're mistakenly assuming that pooled mining will look the same when the block reward diminishes as it does now. Multi-PPS is actually simpler in the future scenario. It's definitely simpler for the miner, who doesn't really need to worry about variance.
 In any case, the fact is that currently mining pools are centralized, so whatever the current solutions are, they're not doing their job. The whole system should be replaced with something better.
3. There are many things I should do, but I only have 24 hours a day. Most of my time is spent on my activity in Israel, but that doesn't mean I should stop innovating.

They can't continue their chain accidentally, but as long as they're not attacked, if they insist they can do it.

It's an extreme analogy, I'll give you that. But the basic ideas are the same. It's about trying to damage the competition instead of competing fairly.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:24:44
Um, no. *All* blocks will be empty. There will be no blocks that have any transactions at all. That's the point of a majority hashrate attack.

I am. The linked comment is consistent with this, I was arguing against plans to attack Core.
But the issue is bigger than that. I believe in the right to split more than I believe in Core. I would be against any plans to perform hashrate attacks on BU as well.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:47:06
We wouldn't be having this problem if SegWit wasn't being opposed. Just saying.

Thanks for the clarification, this position is very reasonable. Though, 90% to accept a version you did not originally support seems to me a bit on the low side. Something like 95% is more clear-cut.

It has happened occasionally by fringe actors, it was not condoned by either me or most of the Bitcoin community. How does the fact that it has happened before detracts from my argument?
The fact of the matter is that there are hundreds of alts operating currently. Attacks have never been a widespread thing.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:08:58
It's not playing by the rules of the protocol. The protocol says you're supposed to mine on top off the current leaf block, rather than purposefully ignoring and orphaning blocks.
The possibility of a &gt;50% attack (and actually &gt;25% via hashrate amplification aka Selfish Mining) is a flaw of the protocol. Exploiting that flaw to attack the network is malicious, whether the attacker is a bank or a BU supporter. Just like going inside an unlocked house and stealing stuff is malicious - "Possible" is not the same as "Justified". We should condemn attackers just like we condemn thieves.
@_date: 2017-03-30 10:27:41
I don't think Jihan Wu is that important. I started to invest into Bitcoin in 2011 by ignoring so called "Jihan".
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:31:49
I think you are confusing "mining your own business" with *active attacking*.
If BU reaches 95% (or anything else), and start mining their own chain with &gt;1MB blocks and ignoring Core blocks, that's perfectly fine. (I mean, up to the fact the BU itself is not that great). Core miners can still mine their own blocks on their own chain.
What they are talking about is actually infiltrating the Core chain and orphaning blocks (while replacing them with empty ones) over a prolonged period of time. In this scenario Core can't continue to mine their own chain as they are consistently harassed.
With 95% SegWit activation, if there is anyone who still wishes to use the old Core protocol sans SegWit, they can still do so. They'll have to modify their code to identify their "correct" chain but once they do they can continue mining their old protocol in peace.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:48:36
I didn't come from anything to anything. I've been saying that a clean split is reasonable outcome for the past 1.5 years, as you can see in the linked blog posts.
Other Core supporters are entitled to their own opinion.
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:21:52
It's supposed to happen once every four years *if hashrate stays the same*. If hashrate increases it will happen more often.
It's an alarm. It's supposed to tell us when something is going on. Something is going on now (hashrate has increased considerably in a short amount of time), so it's telling us that.
N = Everything is normal
A = Alarm is triggered
The alarm was designed so that
Pr (A|N) ~ 0
Pr (N|A) = P(N)P(A|N)/P(A) ~ 0
Pr (!N|A) ~ 1
Meaning, if the alarm is triggered, then almost certainly things aren't normal.

Feel free to link to references that might convince me I have underestimated the problem.
In any case, as mentioned, I don't condone these attacks either.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:08:00
I'm starting to be convinced you are indeed being disingenuous. In previous successful soft forks nobody wanted to remain with the old protocol and came under attack. There might have been some miners too lazy to signal acceptance, but once they saw the protocol changed they happily moved along. (Or, maybe they weren't happy, but agreed to move on.)
What I am opposing is an actual *attack*. As in, there are users and miners who insist on the old protocol and try to operate according to it, and other miners purposefully attack them to prevent them from being able to do it. That's not the same, at all, and I don't see why I need to repeat the same thing over and over again.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:12:50

Their announcement is naive and dangerous - they're saying coins are safe with them, when they're apparently not.
However, Your title (here and on FB) is misleading and twists their message. Breadwallet's announcement didn't mention Bitmain in any way, so I don't see why your title should.
Even if we all know that practically, "the chain that is the most popular amongst miners" will be largely determined by Bitmain.

As I recall, once when Roger was explaining Bitcoin to a bunch of people, a random passerby told him that how he teaches people about Bitcoin is just like how Jesus taught people, and that he's like a "Bitcoin Jesus". Since then he's been calling himself that, and others followed.
The fact that others followed suit does indicate that he was highly regarded. If most other people had tried to call themselves that it wouldn't have caught on.
Hm, this makes me wonder how much mileage I'd get trying to call myself Bitcoin Moses.

@_date: 2017-03-25 19:07:00
No. As long as they have more hashrate than the network they're attacking, they're guaranteed to be able to orphan all blocks.
Even if the chain finds a few blocks, they just need to keep working until they have the longer branch.

You are misrepresenting game theory, and decision theory / rationality in general. The objective of the above is to maximize your utility. Utility doesn't have to mean "your selfish self-interest", it can definitely take into account the interests of others.
Basically, moral arguments can refine the utility of actors such as Bitmain, so that their game-theoretical actions work to benefit mankind and not harm it.
This doesn't necessarily mean Bitmain itself has to be moral. It's enough if its potential customers demand moral behavior and provides disincentives to immoral behavior.

I didn't imagine it would receive such a wide response :)
I've seen some criticism of the singing in the end. I'd like to point out a few things in my defense:
1. My voice was already thrown from all the yelling that preceded the song. This itself resulted from a combination of a. I decided not to hold a mic for a variety reasons, most notable is that I had other plans for my hands. b. My voice isn't so loud, so being sufficiently audible required quite a bit of effort.
2. The vocal range of this particular song is challenging for me, and I'm struggling with some of the higher notes. It's touch-and-go how well I pull it off. I chose this song anyway because it's a nice song, and actually relevant to my message on multiple levels.
3. I didn't really have time to rehearse it much - my performance improves drastically for songs I rehearse. I came up with the whole bit the night before the event in which it took place, and due to being otherwise engaged I had little opportunity to practice.
4. The recording equipment used wasn't ideal for capturing singing.
5. Good singing or not, people are talking about it, so it achieved its desired purpose.

No. I'm talking about a different effect.
You are correct that the off-by-one error causes a 0.05% slowdown. I'm talking about an additional 0.05% slowdown caused by... Well, you'll have to read the paper to understand why (it's because the time per interval is a ratio of Erlang variables, rather than simply an Erlang variable). For a total of 0.1% above the original intention.
The paper also explicitly addresses the fact that the bug exists, and moves on to analyze the "correct" system without the bug.

The most significant factor determining this is hashrate growth. Unfortunately, nobody knows what it will be (except maybe the guys at Bitmain, who refuse to share this information).

Not sure how much is into Reddit (last post a year ago) but he's been informed of this comment, and will hopefully reply soon.
In the meantime I'll try to address some of the concerns as a big SPECTRE fan, with my limited understanding based mostly on a talk he's given about a year ago (a year which was dedicated specifically to make as sure as possible there are no serious mistakes).
1. I don't think there's such a thing as "invalid blocks". All blocks are valid and all of them give minting reward to the miners (and tx fees for txs which first appeared in the block, where "first" is measured by the ordering dictated by the SPECTRE method). So worrying about losing your rewards due to mining on a "dishonest chain" is a non-starter.
2. You seem to have a point about SPV, he mentioned it before as a "future work" kind of thing and I haven't heard any news about it since. Should be doable, though.
3. To me it's quite clear that the network split attack you've described doesn't generalize to SPECTRE. In longest-chain, each block is forced to point to the one block which has the most work, which for every side will be one of its side, making them diverge further apart. In SPECTRE, a block can point to every known blocks, including blocks from both sides of the network. So if propagation time is X minutes, each side will be up-to-date about, and acknowledge, what the other has been doing X minutes ago.

@_date: 2015-08-25 08:16:04
Right, the problem was indeed discussed ([here's an earlier reference]( but I'm not sure a satisfactory solution was found. We'll need to come up with one.
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:06:37
1. No, I do not realize this. I do realize that I help solve the problem by spreading accurate information wherever I can.
2. I'm not sure what being a technical expert has to do with the politics of forum moderation.
3. I've actually openly stated I disagree with the moderation policy. I'm not sure the same can be said about any other redditor with the expert flair.
4. I know that no matter what I'll do, I won't live up to your ideal of perfection. So, should I just stop doing anything? If everyone does as well, where will that leave Bitcoin?

I haven't. But the exchanges for the less popular chain needn't even be the same ones that are major today.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:07:12
Right, the guest chain needs to support merged mining for it to work. That's probably a more significant change that switching the hash function, so I didn't discuss it.

@_date: 2015-08-19 21:25:34
Miners shouldn't be the ones making the choice about the block size limit, as I explained in response to Jeff's BIP 100.
They're only supposed to ratify choices that were made by the community, with the core devs as their proxy.
@_date: 2015-08-18 08:07:46
Sorry for being the odd one out in theymos' list, not having my stance on the issue clear :). I will clarify it, but only after I explain at length why I reject the whole premise of the question.
This used to be a technical debate about block sizes. We were presented with two bad choices: Keep it at 1MB which is obviously too low, or increase to 8MB/20MB which is obviously too high (obvious to me anyway). As a community we've failed to reach a compromise, and I think that if more people pushed for a reasonable number like 3-4 MB in the short term (including also Gavin and Mike on one extreme, and Peter on the other), things would be different now.
Given that compromise failed, Gavin and Mike went ahead to push Bitcoin-XT, and now the real issue isn't about technology, it's about the philosophy of Bitcoin evolution. To me, Bitcoin-XT represents a somewhat reckless approach, which in the name of advancement shatters existing structures, fragments the community, and spins the ecosystem into chaos. Whereas Bitcoin Core represents a frigid approach, where no technology improvement will ever be made because consensus can't be reached, and where we can't do anything about the fact that we can't do anything, because of the delegitimization of attempts to change the status quo by forking and letting the best currency win (and make no mistakes, there *will* be many necessary technology improvements down the road; the block size limit pales in comparison).
Both choices are bad.
I had plans once to write a paper about the game-theoretic aspects of changing the Bitcoin protocol, the contingencies in case of a fork, and how the mere threat of a fork can create a Schelling point which would prevent it from happening. I regret never getting around to it, because it might have been illuminating in the current debate. (For that matter, the other paper I had plans for writing was about transaction fees and how they relate to things like a block size limit; I regret that too, but again the block size is no longer the real issue).
But anyway, I do strongly believe that the *possibility* of forking Bitcoin - even if at first it has no consensus - is vital to Bitcoin's health, growth and survival. It's the glue that holds everything together and makes sure the Bitcoin economy has a say in case something goes wrong with the development. Ideally a contentious fork would forever remain a theoretical possibility - but if it is possible it means it can happen, and that's what we're seeing right now. Rejecting a fork on the grounds that it's a fork is wrong.
Of course, there are reasons to reject Bitcoin-XT on the grounds that its timing and method are wrong. The objection to the technical change was too strong to just gloss over it. We're definitely not anywhere near the point where Pieter, Greg or Wladimir can be conceivably considered rogue and we should break away from them. Mike and Gavin have, quite arrogantly I would say, assumed that this is just like any other software change and that virtually everyone will just automatically follow them, where the reality is far from it. They didn't properly consider the consequences of making this move without enough support. (They might reply that they have been fighting for this for a long time and exhausted all other options, but I don't accept this - they made many attempts at persuasion, but not enough at compromise).
So here we are, having to choose between two bad alternatives. The mere act of choosing commits, in my opinion, the logical fallacy of privileging the hypothesis. There are millions of possible approaches, and "someone" out there restricted them to just 2. Most of the decision process (culling from millions to 2) was made for me and I'm left rubber-stamping one of the choices that remain. (See also 
But hey, even a noisy bit contains some information, and the question *was* asked, so...
Given the choice between short-term sticking with 1MB or going all the way to 8MB, I am in favor of going to **8MB**.
Given the choice between sticking with Bitcoin Core or switching to Bitcoin-XT, I am in slight favor of sticking with **Bitcoin Core**, but that could change any time.
All that said, the parent post explaining theymos' policy makes no sense to me. As explained above, the possibility of forking is an integral part of Bitcoin. As long as Bitcoin-XT has non-negligible support as the true Bitcoin implementation, even with nothing resembling unanimous consensus, it is a part of what Bitcoin is, and of course is on topic on a Bitcoin subreddit.
Even if for some reason we take a purist approach that Bitcoin = Bitcoin Core, I'd imagine that most posts about Bitcoin-XT would compare it in some way to Bitcoin Core, and as such are on-topic (just like a post comparing Bitcoin and Litecoin would be on topic).
I'm considering upgrading the above to a post, but honestly, since it includes a discussion of Bitcoin-XT, I'm not even sure it passes the moderation rules...
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:59:37
Well, I disagree.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:22:09
Dynamic block sizes are an idea that might sound pleasant but I'm yet to be convinced that is has any sort of sound basis.
It's basically saying that whenever miners push against the limit, the limit gives. So it's really like not having a limit at all.
But, as long as we're talking about new sophisticated mechanisms... I'd like to remind everyone about my suggestion for an [ block cap). I'd spend more time pushing it (I've even considered hiring someone to code it), if I thought the main issue was still the block size limit.
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:55:18
They should consider the consequences of their actions. Forking Bitcoin in an unclean way can have dangerous consequences.
Bitcoin-XT has a trigger that, under certain conditions, will start accepting big block starting in block X. They should make it so that starting at this point, the client will only create and accept txs with a changed format. This way Bitcoin-XT will be completely compatible until this point, and completely incompatible after this point.
@_date: 2015-08-25 10:34:43
I think that as things stand now, mining on multiple pools is too complicated. A new multi-PPS framework needs to be developed to make things easier. But there just hasn't been enough effort in that direction.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:42:03
There are some preparations required, but there's nothing which is inherently complicated. After the first incompatible block, trade and withdrawals will be frozen for an hour or so and the order book will be erased. All existing balances will be duplicated - a 100 BTC balance will become a combination of 100 BTCc and 100 BTCx. Then trades will be resumed as separate currencies with their own order books and withdraws (in pure coins). Deposits will be considered based on which blockchain includes the deposit tx - if it's on the c/x/both chain, it will be credited to the c/x/both balance.
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:11:51
But it's a good idea for me to do so. It is of utmost important to be prepared for the contingency of two chains. Exploring different possibilities with the exchanges is a key component of this preparation.
@_date: 2015-08-21 13:51:36
It's out of scope and would be significantly more complicated to arrange.
But the panel will, whatever the language, include proponents of various views - but people who are probably not as famous as Gavin, Mike, Pieter, Greg, Adam etc.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:57:47
I do. But honestly I hadn't thought of that as I wrote the post. So it's worse than I thought, but still, it should work since some miners will care about their chain and make an effort to keep it going.
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:02:54
Good point (though I don't think the typical miner is in the business of shorting and attacking competing chains), and a good reason to switch to another hash function altogether.

@_date: 2015-08-20 15:16:13
Because it makes no sense to make a x8 jump when we have the option of a more gradual increase.
Simulation is often not the same as reality, and the only way to know for sure what will happen with a bigger block size limit is to see it in reality. A saner plan is to start with a modest increase, see how it goes, and work our way from there.
Sometimes, we don't have the luxury of a gradual increase. Then we must make simulations and arguments and take a leap of faith based on them, if it's worth the risk.
But here we have this option. So why not take it?
Furthermore, a large increase will give us a false sense of security that the problem is resolved. But it's not, we need algorithmic improvements and we need research for that. 4MB should give us enough time for this, after which we can switch to a more permanent solution.
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:56:45
I [did]( propose this. Unfortunately it's not that easy. I'd have to spend lots of time and energy pushing it, and possibly fund its development. Also, it would solve only one aspect of mining centralization (pools).
But I'm not really sure about the relevance of this question to this post. Mining centralization has little to do with the block size limit, or with forking.
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:08:52
Note that I said "not enough compromise effort" not "none at all".
I don't trust miners to choose between forks. And I don't trust them to set the limit, soft or otherwise.
The fact that some people want miners to vote on setting the rules is unfortunate. That's not how Bitcoin is supposed to work.

I don't forget. I just remember that Bitcoin is more than just a Github project.
Bitcoin-XT is not a new implementation of Bitcoin, it's a new Bitcoin, with a new protocol, a new blockchain (bootstrapped by the old one) and new coins. Writing code is one thing; convincing people to use the new currency **and to call it "Bitcoin"** is another.
@_date: 2015-08-25 09:45:49
Look at all the chaos that is being caused by this fork. People aren't going to switch to a different repo every Monday and Thursday. They'll just accept what Mike does, for what could be years.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:41:43
Well, I wasn't discussing Bitcoin-XT. I was discussing how Bitcoin can survive a fork.
Anyway, I think the policy is that we can only talk about the debate if we add something new. I believe I have.

I'm highly skeptical that commodity transcription+translation would deal well with a niche technical debate. They wouldn't understand half the terms used.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:23:28
I think you're confusing the protocol with its software implementations. Writing another implementation is "easy". Changing the protocol is hard because software running different protocols are incompatible.
Right now, the widely used Bitcoin protocol is one in which several developers have a say. Switching to Bitcoin-XT would mean one person has a say (until he is overthrown again, which as we've observed is messy).
I think you've elsewhere said that the two chains will not coexist. Here you are contradicting this.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:12:28
Algorithms and code are not the same thing.
As long as we stick with a design like the current one but with just a different block size limit, the coding effort involved in changing a parameter is close to 0. Heck, even I could probably do it, and I'm not a professional software developer.
So I don't think there's anything special about the fact the M&amp;G wrote code for this. It's not the code that matters, it's the ideas behind what we want to code - and ideas can only be refined with analysis and discussion.
What does set M&amp;G apart is that they've pushed for their new code to be adopted, which is more a matter of politics than actual coding. So, kudos to them for taking action, but it's not yet clear their action will actually be good for Bitcoin.
If we go beyond parameter changes and implement more sophisticated methods, the coding is nontrivial, but there is still much algorithmic research work to do.

Re the mining oscillation problem: If all else fails, one of the sides could simply switch to a new hash function, and use GPUs until ASICs emerge. It would still be fairly resistant to hashrate attacks. It will be painful, but not fatal. Again stressing my point that we need to prepare.
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:51:16
That's a good plan overall for switching to a new hash function, but it won't help much for this problem. We'll need those 99 SHA-256 blocks, and we'll never get them because all the SHA-256 miners are on the other chain.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:10:17
Currently the most valuable ledger is the traditional banking system. How many people are willing to sacrifice its network effects for what Bitcoin has to offer? About a million, I guess. Why wouldn't people sacrifice the marginally increased network effects of one coin for its better governance vision?
You seem to be underestimating how much people care about this.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:42:40

Everyone's business models and investment are directly harmed by control of Bitcoin being handed over to a dictatorship. Much worse than they could be harmed by any divide.
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:38:50
I'm not talking about BIP101. I am talking, of course, about Mike being given absolute power as to what goes in the code of Bitcoin-XT. Having the de-facto Bitcoin implementation a software that one person controls is as far from decentralization as it gets. When I talk to people about Bitcoin, I don't want my answer to "but who controls Bitcoin?" to be "a guy called Mike Hearn".
I don't appreciate the accusations, though, and I might not respond to this line of inquiry much longer.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:02:17
4x block times (temporarily) is very different from 4x less useful (especially considering you don't even need confirmations for most purposes). And even if 4x less useful, it doesn't necessarily mean 25% of the price.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:16:41
Probably. But I hope that this decrease was already priced in (partially at least), and that's the drop we've seen lately.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:34:06
You're confusing theoretical possibilities with practical ones.
Sure, everyone will have the power to overthrow Mike, just like Mike is trying to overthrow the current developers. But after all the core developers who have been with Bitcoin since the beginning quit, there will be no one around to develop competing code.
Furthermore, contentious hardforking is messy, so there needs to be a reasonable governance model in between forks. Several developers working together is more robust than one deciding everything.
The use of the word "dictatorship" is of course completely appropriate. It's not even necessarily a negative word - many people actively ask for Gavin and/or Mike to be a dictator. I disagree, of course.
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:08:58
I'm a miner since 2011 too. High five!

The "somehow" is called "economics". The primary purpose of a business is profit, and it would be a very weird coincidence indeed if what maximizes profit happens to align perfectly with what end users want. Competition is key to having the two aligned, but when the business can vote on rules that prevent competition things will not end well. In this regard, the mining market is similar to any other market in the world.
Bitcoin is about personal empowerment, not about handing over all the power to a small (or large, for that matter) group of miners.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:52:29
Yes, the initial difficulty will be arbitrarily set - at some number which is surely low enough, which will then rise quickly according to actual hashrate.
I agree a new retarget mechanism is in order, but that's an even bigger change.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:55:39
Not "forever". Until they figure out how to proceed, on their own terms. If they believe in Bitcoin's current governance, they don't need to dance to two developers' flute.
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:50:17
You can have confirmations with the remaining 1%. Furthermore, the 99% will quickly switch back once they realize they can't do anything with the coins they're mining.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:35:51
I don't consider the increase schedule to be very important. We have absolutely no way to know what will make for a good schedule, and whatever we choose now we can always change it again by the time it's relevant. It might serve as a guide but it's silly to think we're just going to set a schedule and stick with it forever.
The block size limit is a series of choices, right now we should be focusing on making the choice that will serve us for the next 1-2 years. Future choices can wait.
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:59:19
Each chain will have 21M, yes. I wouldn't call it "a total of 42M" since they're not commensurable. You'll have 21M coins A and 21M coins B.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:31:18
Coding it is the easy part. Gaining support for it is the hard part. Suppose someone would do that, Gavin and Mike will stick with Bitcoin-XT; and judging by Pieter's recent proposal, most other core devs will stick with a more conservative version. Everyone else will rally behind their favorite core dev. Once extreme positions dominate the discussion, nobody would rally behind the compromise. Compromise must come from within.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:43:06
You misread. You missed the key word "ideally", as in, this is what I want to happen. I explain in the next sentence that AFAIK, that's not what's happening.

Like Jiten, I'm not sure the stress tests were typical of what real demand will look like.
Furthermore, don't forget that any chosen solution must be implemented way in advance. When demand becomes critical we will not be able to change it immediately, we need to plan now for what we will need 6 months from now. And if there's another wave of adoption, we will need more than 1MB.
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:31:26
No, they don't have that vote by design. If 99% of miners agree to change the rules, their blocks will just be invalid and rejected by the nodes of users and their proxies.
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:37:13
Great initiative, the debate badly needs to become more structured.
However, it seems it only covers the technical issue of the block size. Common opinion is that it's not the major issue anymore, but rather the governance structure, Bitcoin's evolution model, forking policies and whose camp everyone is on. Perhaps you can expand it with arguments about these?
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:11:43
I don't think so. The network isn't smart enough to determine what the best block size is. If whenever blocks get full the limit will increase, it's not much different from having no limit at all.
@_date: 2015-07-20 11:13:53
I think that Aviv Zohar's algorithmic research is very relevant here. GHOST solves the problem of reducing the honest network's effective hashrate due to orphans; we still need to figure out a way to eliminate the superlinear advantage big miners have.

There is more to Bitcoin than just the debate about the fork. The censorship, while unfortunate, is really a drop in the bucket.
While you may be correct that speaking out against the censorship is in order, I just don't see how it fits into the post. The point I was trying to make in the quoted paragraph is different.

Why don't they have both?
Besides, there are (many) exchanges for alts, why shouldn't there be exchanges for the less popular version of Bitcoin? It just makes no sense that no exchange will remain for a currency that has a following.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:33:48
You reminded me, I need to add a section about miners.
But I don't think so. The miners and difficulty will split in proportion to the exchange rate. So if coin A is $300 each and coin B is $100, then 75% of miners will mine on coin A, and coin A's difficulty will be x3 that of B. So for an individual miner, both chains are as profitable to mine.
There is an issue of oscillation (miners switching from one chain to the other en masse every difficulty change), this still has to be figured out.

This = me? I'm not a core dev and never have been. I don't have a single commit to any Bitcoin-related repository.
Anyway, given the choice between Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Classic, I support Bitcoin Core. And I believe that it would be noble of Bitcoin Classic to switch their hash function, given that they're the ones pushing for a hard fork; but if they fail to do so, I support Core switching function as a defensive measure.
@_date: 2016-02-13 20:25:19
I think this is prudent.
@_date: 2016-02-14 00:49:52
Hashrate is relative. The new Core would have no fancy ASIC farms, but neither will any would-be attacker.
If the value of the Core coin will be higher than those of alts, it will have higher hashrate, and thus be safe from attacks on their part.

That's just it, the divide is not merely technical. It's about how Bitcoin should be governed (or not), more than about how big the blocks should be.
In fact, even if I didn't think a split was inevitable before, I sure do so now that I've seen Brian's post. I definitely want to split off from all the people who believe Bitcoin should behave the way Brian says it's supposed to behave.
@_date: 2016-02-13 21:16:41
To the extent that we need to "outcompete newer tech like Ethereum", this requires Bitcoin to have a way to evolve and adapt. This will be much easier if we have a natural way to fork and split.
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:49:39
The situation is definitely not symmetrical. Core keeps the team we've had so far, the process we've had so far, and for the time being, the protocol we've had so far (up to soft forks). If there is a split, it is definitely Classic that is splitting from Core.
You should also note that I have offered two alternative ways Classic could have proceeded. If they don't intend to split, they have no right to declare themselves the new Bitcoin development team, without a *very* good reason. And the lack of support indicates they do not have a good reason.
I also never said Core is perfect. Just that Classic is worse.
I'm sorry if my views sound silly to you, but I believe there are proper ways for Bitcoin to evolve, and that what Classic (and XT before them) have been doing isn't one of them.
@_date: 2016-02-14 01:48:25
Because the real difference between Core and Classic is *not* anything technical (block size or whatever). The difference is in a philosophical view of how Bitcoin should be managed, and I reject the view that Classic represents.
What Bitcoin has going for it is the shared belief in some ideals. If we're willing to betray that, we may as well just go back to government currency.

I haven't analyzed it (or Guy's for that matter). I'm not even sure if I think ASIC-resistance is a good thing.
I am sure though we need to have procedures for gradually phasing into new hash functions should the need arise.
I don't think that Myriad's system offers such a strong protection from 51% attack. The same pool can support miners of different functions, and you can also have several pools operated by the same entity. And a single attacker can invest into infrastructures of all functions. That might be more expensive than just one function, but not by much.
@_date: 2016-02-14 00:03:44
It's turtles all the way down.
You, and Brian, and others, can think that Bitcoin is and should be a democracy, and together use a currency based on this principle.
Meanwhile, I and others who reject this view, will split off, and use a currency based on the principle that Bitcoin is a plurality.

Well, Coinbase themselves have quite a lot of pull - for many people they are where they buy and store their coins.
Miners are somewhat flaky - they mostly rejected XT, then mostly supported Classic, then mostly signed a letter supporting a consensual 2MB bump. Who knows what they'll support next. The letter is notably missing Bitmain Tech.
As for nodes - apparently 20% are Classic, which is impressive considering the software was released only a short while ago.
There surely are many other services I haven't mentioned. But it's difficult to gauge exactly how much support each side has. But to me it seems there's enough on both sides for there to be an issue.

Then you can support Bitcoin Classic. Or you can support something else.
My support for Core is not the topic of the OP and I have no intention to convince anyone to support Core. The topic is that there are supporters on both sides and no group should be forced into a chain it does not agree with.
@_date: 2016-02-14 12:34:28
Are you *sure* you've read the linked blog post? Because I never said the minority should have "veto powers". I said it should have the option to split off.


That's easily contradicted by the fact that I held the same views about the possibility of splitting long before there was any actual conflict I could take sides on.
Just because you can't think of a reason why someone would hold a certain view, doesn't mean there isn't one.
And actually - I'm in favor of increasing to 2MB! So I don't understand your logic here...


Then you and I hold different and incompatible visions about Bitcoin, and we should split into different versions.


I understand how usability is important. I also understand that the world is not black and white, and there can be more than one thing that is important. USD is arguably more usable currently than Bitcoin, but I still prefer Bitcoin.


But they have analyzed it and decided that a blocksize increase would not be good.
Once they reached this conclusion, the only question is - do we support the technical experts, or do we allow hostile takeovers by popularity contests?
I supported a blocksize increase when the debate was technical, but I support the experts now that the debate is political.


As I explained at length in the post, this isn't and shouldn't be the reality, and you shouldn't be fooled by him into thinking it is.


Brian (and you) are the ones trying to force your principles on others, with the suggestion that everyone should go for one chain no matter how vehemently they disagree.
I want to allow everyone to live by their own principles.
Reasonable people compromise when it's reasonable to compromise. Sometimes it's not. To give an exaggerated example - if a serial killer showed up in your doorstep and said he'd kill 2 of your children, would you respond "Hm, 2 is a bit much, how about you kill just one instead"?

A basket of currencies is a valid way.
Note that whenever there's a split, you keep your proportional value on each side. So if all you want is to hedge, you don't have to think too hard - simply invest in whatever the dominant currency(ies) is at the time. You will retain your value however it splits in the future, and whichever side wins.
Gold has negligible inherent value because, unlike Bitcoin, it cannot be teleported anywhere in the world cheaply and easily (and industry uses don't nearly justify its current price). So there is little sense in "going back to it".

Maybe not all, but probably most. They've worked hard - some of them voluntarily - on developing Bitcoin, and suddenly the community informs them that "sorry, your roadmap is bad and you should feel bad, you're not good enough for us, we're going with these other guys"? They'll likely feel betrayed and not have motivation to continue. I don't see them crawling to join Classic with their tail between their legs.

Nobody's perfect.
But the ranking of possibilities from best to worse are:
1. Responsible hard fork (assuming there's something that requires forking).
2. No hard fork.
3. Irresponsible hard fork.
IMO Classic is pushing for  while Core is pushing for  which is why I'm more sympathetic towards Core.
But none of that is important. What's important is that both Core and Classic have supporters, and that's not going to change.

I hope you weren't caught up too much in the analogy. My real point is actually basically everything that goes after the first paragraph.
The reason I gave this analogy, is that we don't think much of US president elections, because that's just how US presidency works - we're used to it. Meanwhile, we're used to plurality in the computing market, which is why one vendor takes all seems dreadful.
For me, the way Bitcoin is supposed to work is that there's (potential for) plurality. So elections are dreaded, just like with computing.
I'm well aware of the distinction between protocol and software - I've even addressed it in the original post!
Do I understand correctly that you think it's *bad* the Microsoft dictates the office protocol, and that everyone follows suit? And that it would be better if there was plurality?
In this case, don't you agree it would be bad if Classic (or whoever wins the elections) dictates the Bitcoin protocol, and everyone follows suit? And it would be better if there's a split, and everyone can choose their preferred protocol?

Neither side is perfect. And while I may disagree with Core, I disagree with Classic even more.
It's true that comments from Core's camp can be viewed as anti-pluralistic. But they were said in the context of two attempts at irresponsible forking and should be seen as such. I'll reserve judgement until I can see their commentary on a more responsible fork attempt, when one happens. If I don't like it, I may start opposing them as well and go for whatever is the least evil at the time.
Besides, anti-pluralistic commentary is not unique to the Core camp, as evidenced by Brian's presentation that prompted my post.

@_date: 2016-02-14 23:09:30
Indeed, the definition of responsible is open to interpretation and possible disagreement. I've written some thoughts about my own view about it here: 
From a purely technical perspective, you can always fork (into a separate chain) whether you are 95%, 50%, 5% or 0.1%. And you are able to do so regardless of whether you're doing it responsibly or not, by my definition or by someone else's. That's what I mean by nobody having veto power.
Socially, you can condemn a fork for being irresponsible, which may or may not prevent it from happening. Your power to do so will depend both on the strength of your arguments, and your political clout.
@_date: 2016-02-14 13:46:38
Overall, I'm of the opinion that some mechanism should be introduced that will keep the fee for a transaction proportional to the value transferred (I'm envisioning something like 0.1%, far below traditional banking). This ensures mining is funded by the people who gain value from the network, regardless of technical issues like data size (which is handled separately).
This vision is not completely fleshed-out, because it is not clear how this will behave when non-monetary uses of the blockchain grow in importance.

I can't really tell now if this comment simply fell between the chairs (this happens when there's such a deluge.

@_date: 2016-02-15 23:59:55
Well, the quoted text was something of an exaggeration (and an obvious reference to  I try to be lighthearted even in serious discussions).
The point is that it's not necessarily what the people are saying, but it's definitely how it can feel from the developers' perspective.
Another point is that the main deviation of Classic from Core is not in some constant or scalability roadmap or any such technical thing. It's a change in process. The Core team has a specific process for designing roadmaps and introducing changes, a process which has worked ok so far (not only for Bitcoin, but for other Open Source effots) and which they believe in. A process which, by the way, acknowledges that disagreement is possible (it's "rough consensus", not "100% consensus"). Classic tries to overthrow this process - and that's a big deal.
You are correct that change is possible in a decentralized system, but as I discuss elsewhere in the thread, there are appropriate ways to effect change, and what Classic have been doing, IMO, is not it.
I won't presume to know what Luke-Jr feels about anything. But I'll emphasize that one technical detail or another is not the main issue.
@_date: 2016-02-13 20:27:59
1. Dozens of combined years of experience with Bitcoin tech of Core developers.
2. Defense of the belief that there is a responsible way to fork Bitcoin (and that the way Classic did it isn't it).
On the technical issue of block size I sympathize with Classic's position. On the broader issues, I think switching to Classic would be harmful.
@_date: 2016-02-13 20:37:06
Hashpower is needed for the currency to operate, but it ultimately gets its value from people willing to offer goods and services (including traditional currency) for it, not from miners.
"The hashing power" is not monolithic. If, say, 80% of the hashpower switches to a new coin, and 20% stays with the original, then to a first order approximation, both can coexist - and the coin with less hashpower could be much more valuable than the other, if more people choose to use it.
However, there are some stability issues and possible attacks in this scenario, and this is why one of the sides should switch to a different function, and then the two can coexist peacefully.
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:36:22
Because the difference between Core and Classic is not technical, it is social and organizational.

You'll have to more clearly explain the difference you're seeing.
How do you define "other networks" vs. "a single network"?
My claim is that Core and Classic will be different networks, much like Bitcoin and Litecoin are different networks.
And I never said there are no network effects. I said there are factors other than network effects.
@_date: 2016-02-14 13:30:20


No, this renaming drastically changes the meaning. A fork can be responsible without unanimous support.
There are several ways to have a fork responsibly - none of them require that I agree with the change proposed. (Case in point, I support 2MB blocks, and I still think Classic is forking irresponsibly).


I don't think so. The fact that  means there's only slight status quo bias.
A minority can't veto anything - if a majority wants a change, they can have it, as long as they fork responsibly. They may or may not have to depart from the minority in the process.

Soon Aviv Zohar will publish the whitepaper for his new SPECTRE protocol, you should definitely have a look once that happens. It shares some ideas with what you've written here (e.g. uses a DAG instead of a tree), but is provably immune to several attacks that the current Bitcoin protocol is vulnerable to, even with short intervals between blocks.
An important reason difficulty exists is to regulate the inflation schedule - we want a specific rate of bitcoins/day, so there needs to be a relationship between hashes/block, hashes/day and bitcoins/block. With the current mechanism, bitcoins/block is fixed every 4-year period, and hashes/block is scaled with hashes/day. Any alternative mechanism would have to address this issue.
@_date: 2016-02-14 12:10:14
Yes! I am not describing a difference between a &lt;=2Mb vs a &lt;=250Kb chain. I'm describing the difference between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic.
As I've mentioned multiple times in this comment section, the real difference between Core and Classic is *not* anything technical like a block size, and if you think it is then of course we'll be talking past each other.
Good people want to defend Bitcoin's ideals, because they think they're important. And if they also believe that abandoning Core in favor of Classic constitutes forgoing those ideals and capitulating to a hostile takeover, they will resist it (e.g. by suggesting a split instead, as I do).

This is the video from an event that took place on February 4th 2016. The event's goal was to spread awareness of a variety of issues concerning Bitcoin's scalability and governance, and to come up with new insights for tackling the challenges Bitcoin faces.
The event had 3 main parts:
* 40 minutes of short lectures
* 45 minutes of moderated round table discussions with the event's participants
* Summary and conclusions of the discussions
The lectures are spoken in Hebrew with English subtitles. The summaries are spoken in English. Glimpses of the round table discussions are also featured in the video.
Lectures were given by:
* **Meni Rosenfeld, aka Israeli Bitcoin Association** - intro, embracing the possibility of splitting to two currencies
* **Aviv Zohar, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel** - the tradeoff between volume and security
* **Ron Gross, aka former Mastercoin executive director** - technological progress and democracy
* **Nadav Ivgi, aka Bitrated founder** - the importance of consensus
* **Adlai Chandrasekhar** - Giving users a choice
* **Guy Corem, aka Spondoolies-Tech CEO** - how Bitcoin Core can survive a contentious hard fork
Discussion moderators included Ron, Adlai, Guy, Nadav and also:
* **Ayal Yona Segev, Bitcoin emBassy in Tel Aviv founder**
* **Jonathan Klinger, Advocate**

I still think the distinction is quantitative, not qualitative.
For every two networks, a potential user which has to choose one must conisder 1. Each network's features, 2. Each network's size. If the features are too similar, the network size dominates and everyone merges with the big network. The bigger the difference, the greater the disparity in network size can be while still maintaining each network's independence.
Litecoin continues to exist because its proponents believe it is different enough from Bitcoin (in a good way) to justify the smaller network.
Similarly, if there is a split to Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic, the difference (technical and social) will be big enough to justify forgoing the bigger network.
In fact, it will be easier for the Core and Classic networks to remain independent, because each has a jump-start of following - unlike traditional alts that had to start from scratch.

Correct, the main causal direction is Usage -&gt; Price -&gt; Hashrate. In case of a Core/Classic split, there will be many people (like me) who will ascribe value to Core coins, keeping its market cap well above the alts; mining power will follow.

The causal graph is Users -&gt; Price -&gt; Hashrate.
I, and many others, will use the original currency, because we believe it represents stronger ideals. We will also be willing to pay for it. And either we, or someone else, will mine it and sell it to us.
@_date: 2016-02-13 21:07:36
That's interesting.
But I have an assumption of good faith that in neither side there is a majority that wishes to deliberately and maliciously attack the other - they just wish to have a currency that goes by their preferred rules, for them to use. So the other side needn't agree, it just has to not care.
The problems we're trying to solve are those that would happen if things follow their natural course. The countermeasures are quite different for an intentional attack.
@_date: 2016-02-14 12:15:42
Maybe somewhat cheaper, but much? The cost of attacking adjusts itself to be proportional to the total mining reward (itself proportional to the coin value).
Also, arguably, Bitcoin has now more protection than it needs, because of the generation of new coins.
@_date: 2016-02-14 00:20:12
Don't worry, in case of a fork, I'll keep some Classic coins as well.
Also, in fact I originally intended to include in the post a paragraph to the effect that the ease in which one side will be abandoned is directly contradicted by the abundance of alts. I've added this paragraph now. It goes like this:


@_date: 2016-02-13 23:42:36
Remember that hashrate is not absolute, it is relative. The only requirement for the network to be secure is that the honest network has more hashrate than a would-be attacker.
If we switch to a new function, we won't have fancy 28nm ASICs... But neither will the attacker. By the time attackers develop ASIC, so will we.
We could also adopt an ASIC-resistant methodology. Guy has suggested a frequent function rotation, to prevent ASICs from ever being developed and keeping everyone mining on GPUs (or FPGA, or CPU, or whatever, depending on the function). This way it's strictly a matter of how much BBB the honest network puts on GPUs, and how much does the attacker. If there are enough users, the price and mining rewards will be high, so we will have adequate security.
@_date: 2016-02-15 18:03:59
I do have a few more things to say, feel free to disengage if you think this discussion has run its course.


To an extent, yes. Forking shouldn't be done willy-nilly. If they can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.
But I have to clarify something about my position: There are several levels of split. It can be short-, medium- or long-term. I *prefer* that there's no split but I'd like people to have the option. And as much as I disagree with Classic, I might be ok with a short-to-medium term split where people *can* stay with Core if they so wish, but ultimately decide to switch to Classic after all.
So while clearly Classic had no intention for a long-term split, my  alternative could have been satisfied with a better preparation for a short-term split. That is, I'd be ok with a message like:
"Hi guys, we don't approve of the current development team and its roadmap. We want to try something new. We hope everyone joins us and that this will be the new Bitcoin - we don't want a rift in the community. But anyone who prefers the current way can still continue to use it, we're not strong-arming anyone"
But since they've made no preparation for a short-term split, they're basically saying that if they succeed, nobody should be able to choose to stick with Core - it's their way or the highway. That's hostile.




There's no black and white. The greater the suggested change, the greater the onus. A soft-fork, even if unpopular, is not the same as team change + governance philosophy change + hard fork.


Classic knew there was a fundamental disagreement before their inception, so I don't follow the point here.


This is basically exactly why I've written the OP. I think there are irreconcilable differences on many levels and that a split is inevitable, if not now then in the future. Debate can only go so far - we've been at it for almost a year with no apparent progress.


I think the term "alternative client" understates how big a deal it is to promote a conflicting protocol.
The bad thing is that the capacity of "decision" allowed by their offer is very limited. The way they went about it is consistent with Brian's vision, where you can "vote" on your preference but if you're a minority, tough luck, you'll be trampled by the majority and no longer be entitled to the coin that you (and others) want - no more decision for you. Leaving Core to be the responsible adult that has to clean up the mess and prepare for the split. Classic are promoting the bigger change, they should be the one in charge of ensuring the process goes smoothly.


Even if we agree they have the right to write code and put up a website that talks about it, that doesn't mean it's not harmful, or that I mustn't reject them for doing so.
@_date: 2012-12-13 19:28:55
The paper explicitly specifies that it is assumed that the difficulty is constant, and hence, amount of proof of work \propto number of blocks.
Since difficulty changes only once every two weeks (and normally, will only lead to a deviation of 1 block) this should have little practical importance. And, the scenario you suggest only disadvantages the attacker, as there will be less relative variance in the number of blocks he finds; hence he will not follow this, reducing to the standard case.
@_date: 2016-02-14 13:20:12
There are responsible ways to fork, and there are irresponsible ways.
I'd be more sympathetic to Classic if they had done one of the following:
1. Get significant support from technical experts before announcing anything publicly.
2. Clarify from the get-go that they are going for a split, choose a less misleading name than "Bitcoin Classic" (preferably without the word "Bitcoin" at all), and take care of any issues of tx version / hash function required to keep a clean split.
Everyone always has the right to split off for whatever reason (as I advocate in the post). But nobility obliges to do it in a non-harmful way, as I described in 
Alternatively, one can announce that the current technical leadership is untrustworthy, and Bitcoin as a whole should switch to a new team. But in this case there must be many technical experts who share this view - they can't all have gone rogue. Failure to find such support (with all respect to Gavin and Jeff, there's only two of them) indicates there's no real problem to begin with, and in this case there's no justification for a coup.
Since Classic is neither a declared split nor a justified coup, I can only view it as a hostile takeover attempt. And I can't condone that.
@_date: 2016-02-14 12:52:45
It's a technical issue.
If we assume both sides are peaceful but profit-maximizing, then having the same function for two chains means the hashrate will fluctuate back and forth between them (according to which is more profitable at the time), and
there will be wild oscillations in each side's hashrate and difficulty. So much so that one side could have a "winter", where nobody mines because the difficulty is too high, but the difficulty never adjusts to the low hashrate because no blocks are mined, and 2016 blocks are required for a retarget. If this was a rare occasion it could have been hardcoded out, but that is actually a matter of course in this situation.
This issue might be alleviated with a faster-acting retargeting mechanism, but for now we're stuck with Bitcoin's 2-week interval. We might suggest changing that instead of the hash function, but that's a more drastic change IMO.

Why would they need to install a new, non-bitcoin.org client? They can just continue using the known-good old bitcoin.org client. Which is the default, by the way, they need to explicitly upgrade to the new, potentially compromised client - which they should only do after it has been properly vetted.
Also, the person installing it doesn't need to check the source code himself, he just needs one person in the entire planet to make any exploit known.

Back in the XT days I would agree that your scenario  is the most likely. But Classic seems to have much more support than XT did back then, so it's not at my top anymore.
Your scenario  is what I would consider a nightmare scenario which must be avoided at all costs. It's like the extinction of a rare species. This is why I believe Core should, as a defensive measure, switch to a different hash function if there is a danger of Classic prevailing. This will allow the two coins to coexist peacefully, each with its own hashing network.

Yes, with the same number of confirmations, in Litecoin the attacker has 4 times as many opportunities to try double-spending per time unit. But if Litecoin merchants waited for 24 confirmations instead (same average wait time), the attacker's probability of success can be a million times less (or whatever, depending on the particular numbers). This is the dominant factor, not the time to carry out the attack.

This is wrong.
The odds against winnning the lottery 10^15 times are **not**
    (2*10^8 * 10^15).
    (2*10^8)^(10^15)
which is incredibly more massive. It's a number with about 8 quadrillion digits, much more than 49 digits.
The chance of hitting a random key is like winning the lottery about 6 times. (And if you take into account scanning many keys over a period of time it becomes more like 3-4 lottery winnings). Which is still, of course, very unlikely.
@_date: 2012-12-15 16:02:36
reph, what you say is wrong because you forgot an important part.
The "mainline" bitcoin client will always follow the chain with the most hashing power *that follows the same rules it does*.
If there is a chain that has lots and lots of hashing power but follows completely different rules, the client will reject all those blocks as invalid and ignore this chain.
If there are 1000 TH/s working on a chain that sends extra coins to Gavin, and 10 TH/s working on a chain that has no such shenanigans, clients of the latter will simply ignore those 1000 TH/s because their blocks are invalid. The entire world for them will be 10 TH/s, all the rest is just some other incompatible network unrelated to Bitcoin.
Hashing doesn't exist to make the rules. It exists to do just the one thing for which hashing is needed - to synchronize the order of valid transactions.
@_date: 2012-12-15 16:04:52
For setting the rules - neither, as lllama points out.
For ordering transactions - it's &gt;50%, though it's actually a bit more complicated than that.

The question is, what is the invariant?
If the invariants are the network hashrate and the attacker's hashrate, then a reduced difficulty means a reduced time constant (either by design or as a temporary artifact), which has no effect on security.
If the invariants are the attacker's hashrate and the time constant, then yes, a reduced difficulty means reduced network hashrate, increased attacker proportion, and reduced security. But that's not what I, or apparently Jiten, were talking about.

You would have an app on your phone that manages keys, and allows you to create channels, issue payment requests and send payments.

For me it's less like a president winning the US elections, and more like Apple winning the elections and forcing everyone to use their products - no more Windows (and Linux) computers and Android phones.
As I mentioned elsewhere, the real difference between Core and Classic is not anything technical like a block size. It's about how Bitcoin is governed and how it evolves.
For me, Classic represents populism, recklessness, and dismissal of technical expertise and proven dedication. Because of this I oppose Classic. You could say I support Core "religiously", but it's not 1MB religion, it's social ideals religion.
But that's *not the point* and not the reason I view  as a disaster. The point is that I'm not the only one. There are many people who, for whatever reason, oppose what Classic represents. And in  all of them will have to see their vision of what Bitcoin is supposed to be destroyed. That's too much to bear.
Even if the transition to Classic appears to happen smoothly, we'd still have to worry about the longer-term effects:
1. How will the new team handle future technical challenges, after losing almost everyone who has been with Bitcoin since the beginning? How will their "decide by popularity contest" governance mechanism play out?
2. How will the Bitcoin community handle future crises, after surrendering its ideals and allowing a hostile takeover by Classic?
All in all this sums up to the basic point: There are people who want the original Bitcoin to continue its course. Not just "weakly prefer", it's actually meaningful to them. Having it vanish despite their wishes is bad, and does not bode well for the future.
If this was just about "the economic incentive of following the supermajority", I'd ditch Bitcoin altogether and just stick with government currency. But it's not just about that - it's also what each currency is, how it works and what it represents. That's why we have alts like Litecoin, Ripple and Ethereum... And why we can have Bitcoin split in two.
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:00:40
1. I think a block limit of 2MB is fairly harmless, and has meaningful upside.
2. The more advanced scaling solutions aren't here yet - and even when they are, there are still tradeoffs to be made, and I believe a healthy limit is bigger than 1MB. In fact, I've read research (haven't analyzed it though) that no block limit is needed at all, because miners will limit the block size on their own to prevent lost revenues from delayed propagation.
3. I believe that in the future, hard forks for more meaningful changes will be necessary; and I fear that by strongly opposing a simple change like increasing to 2MB, we're calcifying into a situation that no hard fork will ever be made. Getting one fork out of the way will make future ones easier.
4. Hopefully, adopting 2MB in Core will take support away from Classic and put an end to all this nonsense (at least for now). I don't condone surrendering to political pressure, but I think a small concession that can go a long way is ok.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:02:36
I think he's just describing a singular payment channel, with the understanding you can only pay someone you've already established a channel with. That idea, of course, is not something I came up with.

@_date: 2018-03-18 01:47:37


This is only true if you assume a tree topology...
In a randomly connected network of a billion nodes, you need more than 10 edges per node just to be connected, let alone have a diameter of 20.
In an organic network which is not completely random but still has cycles (for redundancy if nothing else), you'll still need more than 3 edges per node.

There are some fluctuations, but if you're ok with a few hours for confirmation, then sending with, say, 5 sat/B is fine. Good wallets allow you to choose the fee freely.
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:30:08
I'm in favor of increasing the block size (in addition to the increase built into SegWit) sooner rather than later, for the following reasons:
1. It can help reduce fees until other scaling solutions are deployed, which will take quite some time
2. It will be necessary at some point even with all other solutions
3. The network can take it, running a node will still be manageable even with a further increase
However, I think there are higher-priority upgrades. One of my next goals is to write a paper discussing elastic block caps and start championing them.
Anyway, for a long time the scaling debate hasn't been about scaling, but about governance. The various camps differ mostly in their ideas about how protocol change decisions are made, rather than specific technical solutions.
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:03:17

Correct; but the path is gradual, and some increase will still be needed earlier than 50 years.
Also, I can understand people who say we shouldn't increase the block size now, but not people like the parent comment (now removed apparently) who say we shouldn't increase the block size ever.

I *should* be upgrading to the latest version. I just have different priorities personally. Of course the effort that went into developing it is blessed.
Anyway, I think a fairer comparison is all Core nodes vs. Classic+XT nodes. Because XT supporters will likely support Classic, just haven't upgraded yet.
But as also mentioned, counting nodes isn't reliable anyway because that can easily be gamed.

Well, yes, the goal is that eventually all the channels and stuff will be done under the hood, and the end-user interface will be reminiscent of current Bitcoin wallets. But developing this will probably take even more time than just basic LN clients.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:57:55
tl;dr: LN can work; it is fast and cheap; hubs are not strictly necessary and even if used, are nothing like banks; the future is bright.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:13:27
Unfortunately I'm not an expert on this; however, the way I see it, fully-validating Bitcoin network nodes know of all transactions, so they can know the entire LN graph at a similar cost. These nodes can be queried to find optimal paths, just like nodes are currently used to support SPV clients.
Or, if the user runs a node themselves (making this possible was the point of offloading payments off-chain), they can find a path on their own.
Anyway, doing this efficiently will require cutting-edge graph theory algorithms, and possibly new ones that will be developed as the need grows.
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:57:32
I don't see a problem with having LN nodes on smartphones. If I'm receiving a payment through my phone, it usually means I am currently interacting physically with someone, and opened my app for this purpose, making it available to receive a payment.
A bigger problem is that you need to watch out for cheating. By default this requires you to be offline for no longer than the CSV period. However, this can be resolved with Watchtower.
I think we will definitely see delegation schemes for covering for us when we're offline, but we need to be careful not to let it devolve into traditional hosted wallets. One possibility is that, in addition to our normal node, there will also be a compound node based on multisig between several providers. When we're offline, we can accept payments through this delegation, and they can only steal funds by colluding. Finding the best arrangements will require a lot more R&amp;D.
I'm actually not sure if it's technically possible to have a delegate that can only receive payments on your behalf but not send. That would make things much easier.
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:48:43
I don't think this terminology has been fully defined yet.
Currently, LN nodes should know about all open LN channels (so that they can find appropriate paths), but they don't need to know about other txs in the Bitcoin network, thus, are not fully validating Bitcoin nodes and they don't download the full blockchain. They can connect to Bitcoin nodes, like SPV clients do, to learn about txs that interest them.
As the network grows, it is expected that most end users will not want to know the entire network topology. They will run "lightweight LN clients" that mostly manage keys, and get data about routes from LN nodes they connect to. Or they can contain partial information and find routes based on additional information they gather from peers.
When most txs on the network will be LN channels, the distinction between LN node and Bitcoin node will be blurred.
Again, it's too early to answer definitively about the different kinds of nodes/clients that will exist, and their names.
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:23:48
If an LN node has outdated information about the fees for each channel, and tries to route a payment based on it - will the payment attempt become invalid, or will it just involve a suboptimal total fee?
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:21:47
You do realize that even with LN, the block size will eventually need to be increased significantly to support global ubiquitous usage? My calculations suggest a target of roughly 500MB.
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:49:26
I think there are indeed some errors in what wrote, though I haven't read the full context.
In theory, a merchant can operate while only ever having 1 channel. He receives payments through the channel; then when he wants to pay suppliers, he does that through the same channel; through this channel he accepts more payments; and so on. Money just flows back and forth through this channel. Hopefully, the counterparty is a bit better connected, and can route incoming and outgoing payments through the whole network.
Of course, with only 1 channel there's isn't a lot of flexibility in finding routes, and if the counterparty happens to be offline they're screwed. That's why they *should* open several channels.
And yes, hubs which open up channels as a service will require a fee for it. The cost should be, as discussed in the post, quite small.

What, in your view, does the word "consensus" mean?
To me it means that people bring up ideas, discuss, and after discussing they can decide if they agree with something or not.
But it seems you don't believe people should bring up ideas and discuss. You rule out blocksize increase as some sort of axiomatic dogma, and suddenly anyone who argues that it should be done in Bitcoin is not a true Bitcoiner.
You should take your own advice - just because *you* don't want the blocksize to ever increase, doesn't mean that's the consensus. You should ask some people what they think, I believe you'll be surprised by the results.
Also, you are factually wrong. Schnorr signatures and the like are a drop in the ocean, there's no way these incremental improvements will be sufficient, and that's *with* LN. I'd bet you didn't even bother to go over the calculations in my post, you just decided there will be no blocksize increase and that's it, you're immune to facts and analysis.
In my last comment the only thing I said I wanted was for everyone to be able to use Bitcoin. If that's not what you want, perhaps you should rethink who among us is a true Bitcoiner and who is not...
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:01:25

You're right; actually I wanted to use this term in the last comment, but its exact name escaped me for a moment. In the post I think it's fine to omit this term, since the time value of money needn't be due to opportunity cost; it can be actual interest payment for a loan taken.
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:07:12
1) Well, I'm aware, but perhaps I don't fully understand the implications. But if I understand correctly, the intermediaries can still deduce the sender and receiver if they all collude. So I think it's safe to work on the assumption that the intermediaries do know something.
2) Possibly it's overkill, there are many possible configurations - there's a tradeoff between number of hubs, number of channels per hub, and number of hops per payment. With only hundreds of channels per hub each payment will likely require 5 hops - which is still pretty good, but 4 is better and achievable.
0.12 BTC limit seems awfully low to me (maybe not so much if BTC price goes up?), I hope it will be relaxed sooner rather than later.

Yeah, you can be sure I was confused too. I based this observation on about 4 examples, which was suspicious but not conclusive. I expected someone smarter than myself to tell me either "it's wrong - here's an example", "it's a bug", or "it's by design". Which Hal eventually did :). But I should have pressed this further when weeks passed without resolution, maybe we would have identified this sooner.

To the best of my understanding, channel factories don't significantly help with this.
Side chains don't offer the same security guarantees that Bitcoin does. Yes, if people use some sidechain they like it can reduce the load on the main Bitcoin network while preserving monetary continuity, but I want everyone to be able to use the real Bitcoin.
Maybe some sort of new sharding design that makes heavy use of ZKP can allow the network to scale while minimizing the resource requirement for any single node, but this is at this point completely speculative.

To the best of my knowledge, what is conceived as an LN node in the current protocol and implementations, is something that knows the state of all open channels.
That can should change in the future, as it becomes impractical to have up-to-date information about everything.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:19:59
Note that this part referred specifically to channels between hubs and other hubs. These channels aren't for their own use; they exist to provide a service to others. The hub operator took funds which he could have invested someplace else, and put them in a channel so that others can enjoy it. This has a cost, and those who enjoy the channel will pay for it.
Also, I mentioned "time value and cost of security" in one breath, but it is actually the security that I find more significant. Bitcoin being non-inflationary, simply keeping bitcoins is fine, you don't have to invest them. But you want to keep them in secure cold storage. When they're in an online LN channel they are not in cold storage. Securing them under these constraints comes at extra cost.

Terminology-wise, I distinguish "transaction" which is the thing that is broadcast publicly on the blockchain, and "payment", which is what can be done with a channel/LN by updating information stored privately by the parties involved.
Anyway, you're right, it will be harder than I described; but it will still be easier than with traditional on-chain, because the stakes are lower. For Bitcoin nodes, if they don't know about every single transaction they break consensus with the rest of the network. For an LN node, if they have out-of-date information, the worst that could happen is that they will attempt invalid paths and retry.
This means that an LN node needs to keep just the current state, not any history; they can update only occasionally, not for every single payment being sent; and they can keep just a piece of the information, and rely on other nodes to patch it up, without much to lose if they receive incorrect/incomplete information.
Additionally, it might be possible to take the entire connectivity graph and construct a low-dimensional Euclidean representation of it, so that nodes with similar coordinates will tend to be linked. Then it will be easier to find peers who may have information about how to reach a desired node.

Even if each payment is only up to $100, it's still preferable to have channel capacity well in excess of $1000, so it can support many consecutive payments.
If, for example, payments go in either direction randomly, you have Brownian motion, and if the channel capacity is only x10 the size of each payment, it will soon reach the boundary and render the channel ineffective. Better to have bigger channels to keep them stable and getting more bang for the tx fee buck.

Among the 5% who hold different views, some believe SegWit2x should be called Bitcoin; some believe Bitcoin Cash should be called Bitcoin; and some believe no single currency should be called "Bitcoin", but rather fully distinctive terms should always be used.

It does, but I should clarify: What I meant is accepting testnet coins in the same nominal amount as Bitcoin - which are worthless. The idea is that we basically give stuff for free as a reward to someone who has shown initiative by using LN to pay.

Um, what? CSW didn't do any of those things. I doubt he's even heard of Bitcoin before 2015.
But, CSW did do one good thing for Bitcoin - he acts as a litmus test. Anyone who trusts CSW, should not be himself trusted. Makes it easier to resist propaganda and pick the right side, thus furthering a solution.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:03:22
Is it known what exactly went on in the demonstration CSW gave to Gavin and Matonis? That has always been the only reason to suspect CSW is SN, so explaining it away is required to make the argument ironclad.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:22:19
The part "while this remains the case" is important. If at some future time we see consensus that SegWit2x is Bitcoin, we will follow suit - but we don't expect this to happen, and we will not be quick to make the switch.

Someone will have to pay for it, I don't think it's necessarily the receiver. In terms of hubs, yes, a merchant wanting to be able to accept payments will likely pay hubs for the service of setting up an incoming channel.
In a p2p network, I think the norm should be that it is the sender's responsibility to make sure the payment gets through. If there is already a route, the sender should pay the intermediary fees; and if there is no route and the sender wishes to pay by establishing a new channel, he should bear the costs of that as well.

I guess your question is fair but take what you want from the above - trying to convince people of the significance of the IBA itself, for people not already familiar with our work, is not within the scope of the current announcement.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:06:47
You should note that the document says "We, the Israeli Bitcoin Association", not "We, every single person in Israel". The IBA makes this statement and that's what the document says, so it couldn't be more honest.
Anyway, this was approved in a BoD vote (5 approve votes out of 5 board members), not in a GM.
Also, you'll be surprised how unanimous Israeli Bitcoiners are against SegWit2x. I can only think of a handful of people who support it.
We have a website, but I believe pdfs are the best format for official statements such as these.

I don't know of any public displays of trust Gavin has given recently in regards to Craig. I don't recall he said much on the matter after stating "It's certainly possible I was bamboozled". So Gavin can be considered exempt from this rule.

To be fair, I don't think he ever claimed in the blog post that the signature was supposed to be for anything substantial.

This doesn't support your claim, at all.
It is usually the case that when someone loses a job, he seeks another job. Would you rather be the one to break the news to Gadi's familiy that they'll have no livelihood for months until it is appropriate to get a new job? I mean, we can't have him getting a new job the same month, right?
Of course, not all people succeed in finding a new job immediately. And Guy's recommendation obviously influenced Bitmain's decision to hire Gadi. But deducing from this that he "sold his company to Bitmain" and is "a paid Bitmain shill" is conspiracy nut level speculation.

I have very little knowledge about the specifics at play here, but I can offer my own perspective based on our work in the Israeli Bitcoin Association.
Regulators will eventually enact Bitcoin-specific regulation, whether we like it or not. Ignoring regulators isn't going to change that.
What we, as the Bitcoin community, can change, is what this regulation will look like. If we engage them, their decisions will have our knowledge and desires in mind. If left to their own devices, whatever they come up with will be much more draconian.

I didn't necessarily say that they will accommodate our desires. Only that they will be in their mind, which is kind of tautological.
But, it might surprise you to know that government agencies have very few individuals that are actually evil (it's the system as a whole which is corrupt). When exposed to an industry which has specific needs (which are synergistic with those of the country), they might actually consider how to avoid trampling it as much as possible.
@_date: 2016-05-04 12:00:25
I agree - and we need to people to understand this now, so that if he ever does move it, everyone knows why we remain skeptical.
That said, if he does move coins it will demonstrate some sort of connection to Satoshi (even if it's just being able to hack him) - which is more than Craig has now.

@_date: 2015-10-23 09:07:54
Spoken like a true armchair conspiracy theorist.
If you had ever actually talked with people in government positions (excluding politicians - they're a separate issue), you'd learn that that's what they are - people, trying to do their jobs as they understand them. And it's not in the power of any single one of them to redefine what a country is or what is good for it.
You're talking about ideals, while I'm talking about practicalities. There will be Bitcoin regulation, and you can help shape it to a friendly form by talking with the people making the decisions. Or you can bitch about it, and hope that if you close your eyes and wish really hard the government will crumble. Your choice.
Also, the fact is that most people don't want anarchy. I'd venture that most people in the Bitcoin community don't want anarchy. Your attempt to force your anarchistic views on everyone else is fascism in its purest form.

If you've been following what's happening it will probably not be much news to you, but you may consider using it as a reference for people who inquire about this.
Note that originally I was told that BitcoinABC is Bitmain's contingency plan for the case that UASF succeeds, and thus irrelevant if NYA succeeds. Since the time I wrote the original post there have been more talk about BitcoinABC, which can happen regardless of NYA, and thus the prospects of a split are more likely.
By the way, our name in Hebrew for UASF is Yossef / Joseph.

We halved each block multiple times, just to be sure.
@_date: 2016-07-08 03:05:54
The halving time is non-deterministic. It's not really possible to have a party for 300 people at a non-deterministic time, so a date had to be set in advance. The actual halving turned out to be later than the set date.

To be honest I have no idea. But assuming they made it to within Israeli borders, there's no reason they shouldn't join the party.
@_date: 2016-07-08 03:12:10
The main issue is that halving time is non-deterministic, so a date had to be set in advance, on the understanding that most likely it will not coincide with the actual halving.
One of the considerations that went into choosing this particular date is, indeed, that doing it any later would conflict with Shabbat.

This is correct. I was thinking about writing a detailed post about it sometime.
The basic general idea is that while the utility of money is usually concave, in some situations it has steps. Then gambling can increase your expected utility, and the optimal bet can be calculated.
This can happen in a bigger scale - e.g., some shop closed down and you want to seize the opportunity and buy it cheap - but SD wouldn't be suitable for this. (Some raffle-based gambling service, where the service isn't exposed to risk, might work.)

The private key remains offline. But when generating the paper wallet you also derive a public key, and the hash of that is the address. You do bring the address online when you send a payment to this specific address (exactly like you would with an online wallet).
Later when you want to claim ownership of the coins in this address and send them elsewhere, you broadcast a digital signature signed with your secret private key (since most people can't calculate ECDSA signatures with pen and paper, you will likely import the key to a computer, even if it is disconnected from the internet).

BTC is and for a long time will be a high-risk speculative investment. It is not prudent to have too much of your net worth in a single risky thing. As the rate of BTC increases, it automatically becomes a larger portion of my entire portfolio, which isn't good. So I have to sell some to limit my risk.
A polynomial function is the most obvious choice for the overall dependence of position on rate (of course, tactical moves pertaining to specific information may apply). As for the specific exponent of 0.2, it's just what feels right.
More generally, if I keep my position at p = a * r^(-b) then my profit from the rate going from r1 to r2 is a*(r2^(1-b)-r1^(1-b))/(1-b). For b=0.2 this becomes 1.25a * (r2^0.8 - r1^(0.8)).

This is insane. He asked you what you do with the bitcoins because he wanted to know what you do with the bitcoins. If he wanted a randomly picked fake use he would randomly pick a use rather than asking you.
If you don't want to tell him what you're really doing then tell him you don't want to tell him. But don't under any circumstance lie, it's a scumbag thing to do and will hurt him by distorting his understanding of reality.
