Did NXT got delisted? or is it not back online yet?

He had 1.8 millions woth of NXT but no exchange would have accepted them i think. I think he choose the easy solution instead of the long one.
He also said in one post he "believe in NXT" (probably why he kept  8M) so maybe he didn't wanted to hurt the currency too much by keeping them all

Even more salt. More technical statement :
-*they may be able to change the hash, but not the addresses*
-*and once you send a tx you dont listen to your fucking customers saying it didnt send, it fucking sent, thats my routine, hack away i dont give a shit*
-*mtgox use a bullshit wallet system obviously*

You'll have to pay a fee only if you need support by your own mistake. (forgot credentials).
The goal is not to make money, it's to make it so people are more responsible instead of relying on support.
And for the mcxFEE, you only lost money if you sold. They are now back up to pre-shutdown price.

NXT in itself was never compromised, only the major exchange.
NXT future was uncertain when the hacker had 5% of all NXT and Bter was insolvent, with hundreds of user's NXT vanished.
Now that the hacker gave back the NXT and Bter can pay back their users, the worst is behind.
The situation is not pretty for sure, but the great features are still here and the development continue.
You can see the market cap already almost recovered .

Everything RealSolid did for the exchange is custom coded. That mean there is zero know vulnerabilities to exploit. The hacker doesn't know the code and never see it, so he can't find one. 
And that's only one aspect of the security. I'm not an expert in this and i'm only reapeating, RealSolid could explain this a lot better.

There was 1M $ deposited in BTC/alt. And that was before the update. I think it's enough for a good hacker to be motivated.

I'm one of the betatester and i'm so proud the site is live.
We had to close our mouth on the "secret feature" for weeks !
Yes, you can earn interest on your BTC and i think it's BIG. 
Feel free to ask me any questions and i will try to do my best to answer them.

Like i said i'm only repeating.
If you want some proof, the exchange is up since 5month now, and nobody never hacked anything, no downtime, no money lost.
Now compare that to all the other exchange...
I think it demonstrate the site is more secure, probably not perfect, but better in this aspect than the other.

When i say future-proof, i'm talking only about regulation. Government can't do shit about the site, it's only "virtual" money.
Exchange like Bitstamp or Mtgox can't share revenue with the users, can't do interest on deposit, can't do gambling or gaming because it's a big NO from regulatory law.
Mcxnow can do it, and he's doing it.
Of course it have nothing to do with security in itself. Having fiat or not doesn't really have an impact here.

I talk sometimes with the admin of 
And you're right when you say the hardest part are security and regulation.
The security is probably the most important part and the guy spent months to create and test his security, when the exchange code in itself only take less than a week.
For the regulation it's even more of a headache. His bulletproff solution was to simply don't trade Fiat on his site. It's 100% crypto, there is less volume but it's more future-proof.
For Bitstamp and Mtgox, i don't think those error, delay and crossing book are simply incompetence. It's manipualtion on their side for their benefit. Nobody know what is happening behind close doors on their black box and they profit form it.

I'm the one who posted the thread.
They don't let me respond on the forum so i post my response here
"Hello, OP here. (sorry for my english)
Since I posted this thread, my post require a mod approval. And neither of my 2 reply appears (yet?). So i made a new account to respond.
I asked for a refund because :
-when a ordered, the unit were shipping and JODY claimed 400units/day.
But today the shipping seems a lot more slow than what i was lead to believe and i don't think i will receive my unit in time (more than 2 month).
-There are a few thread from early adopters who complains from the products (ventilation, Error rate, etc..)
-I made a wire bank transfer through Paypal, and i don't think its a good idea to wait 2 month because the litigation complain have a 45 day limit on Paypal. And it's maybe the same with my bank (i will check)
-And last, when i decided to order, BFL still offered refund, as the forum told me so,  so i jumped in (the place in line matter). I was sure of my purchase but i though the refund protected me from misjudgment/misrepresentation.

I think  can answer some of your question.
Do not hesitate to contact the adiministrator (  ) if you want more.
@_date: 2013-09-13 17:40:30
But the exchange is targeted like all the others. It hasn't failed yet when the 4 or 5 other big one have. So yes, It's more secure.
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:04:54
Yes, you're not gonna double your deposit with the interest. But it's not an investment, only interest on deposit, so you can withdraw your coin whenever you want. You doesn't even have to trade.
