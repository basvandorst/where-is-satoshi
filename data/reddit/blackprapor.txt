If it all depends on user's consensus, then its sad that there's no simple scroll button in wallet GUI to set your preferred block size limit, so users can actually vote. As for my contribution, at some point I did secure up to 5% of the network hashrate, and helped conman to test and debug cgminer for fpga and later asic compatibility. Also, at some point I believe I saved litecoin from being destroyed by 51% attack, but that's a different story.

Its quite easy to implement. Use message signing option and include a link to a media file on a cloud service. Just need to add UI elements to do that in a couple of clicks into mobile client.
While reading Andre Woons' article, I realised that namecoins could be used to attach an easy to remember phone numbers (with ".bit" at the end) to your long strings of bitcoin addresses. It should be possible to make a mobile app which could make your address registration prone to cybersquatting (there are many namecoin addresses already taken just for that purpose) by using verification codes sent to your phone or let the app read your phone's IMEI. There are several ways of securing your .bit addresses, which then would be linked to your bitcoin addresses. 
Since namecoin is merge mined with bitcoin, its security level is almost same as for bitcoin network. And its name just speaks for itself, but now it could be used not only to register domains, but also tie user's bitcoin addresses to their phones (or real name could be used as well, although many people have the same, so its not the best option)

1. People still have no idea what bitcoin is.
2. Its very hard to buy bitcoins, compared to purchase of other foreign fiat currencies, or bonds, or stock paper and etc.
3. In order to keep bitcoins safe, you have to be an IT graduate to understand the whole process (or for most people it seems that way).
4. 99% of merchants accepting bitcoin converting them back to fiat, which creates an additional sell pressure on bitcoin. Selling pressure is already high because of all those 'smart' investors in asic hardware need to pay for electricity bill and they also prefer to get investment back in fiat (most likely). 
5. Price roller-coaster isn't giving anyone an assurance in bitcoin's future value. (no matter how many log based graphs you guys put here every day)

I think its more about how predictable your outcome is. Every investment is partially gambling per se, because you'll never know all 100% of variables. Pure gambling is about not knowing your chances or having less than 80-85% of confidence in the perceived outcome (not the size of your investment). Overall, if you invest in one venture you tend to decrease your chances, so yeah that does look like gambling even if you're confident about your chances. 
P.S. Good luck to OP, I'm 50% in btw :)

Right now most bitcoin hash rate is produced by asic based hardware, miners can't switch to scrypt any more. To produce an efficient 51% attack and sustain it for at least a few hours will involve manufacturing own asic chips or placing enormous orders to all current asic manufacturers to gain enough hash rate by the time it will be deployed a few months later. 
There are many estimates circulating online about the required hash rate and funds needed to gain it, but as of now, I reckon its around 55-60Ph (keep in mind that in a few months current hash rate will rise more and 51% will have to be of that figure). If someone would make that much hardware with the 20nm chips, it would cost around 250M USD (3$ per Gh chips, making a mask, infrastructure, logistics and etc.). Its a few million chips, so it will take some time to assemble. I'd say put +10-15% more hash rate on top and same percentage of funds to be sure.

yes, you're right about the micro payments. This isn't going to work, unless dev's will implement floating fees (which they're planning to do very soon), and pool operators need to be more "market aware". As you might know, most hash rate now is controlled by pool operators, only a few miners could go solo these days without loosing btc to variance. My point is, we need to get attention of those guys, so they take some action and allow lower fees tx's to be included in the blocks they solve. Most major pools pass on tx's fees earnings to the miners anyway.

I'm not saying its a great secret. But think of what the opportunity to buy lots of bitcoins without affecting the price (maybe even with discount) might give, by dumping them on exchange thus lowering the "official" price then buying again at much lower prices from miners again. This practice is deadly for crypto currencies and it must be prevented.

I think its too late now. Miners are facing decreasing prices on exchanges, and have to sell nearly all bitcoins they mine to cover the electricity bill, while the exchange rate still plummeting down. The adoption rate is just too slow for the demand to catch up.
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:50:07
Its a great deal on their part, really. Cheapest, most merchant friendly and fastest payment processor ever. However, it creates a great danger for the bitcoin itself. Most merchants at this stage prefer to cash out to fiat and as more merchants accept bitcoin through bitpay, that sell pressure is going to increase. It can literally kill the whole system, if there is no counter weight of bitcoin buyers, large enough to offset the pressure. And remember that thing we all like to brag about, when talking about bitcoin, that it doesn't have a central bank or any authority? Well, there is no central bank to stabilise the exchange rate either. We'll see how this plays out =)
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:08:20
there is no point in increasing tx fees. miners will get more fees via increase in the volume of tx's. Fees might get over standard 25btc per block if bitcoin becomes de facto internet payment system.

Ok, I have to admit, now it looks a lot better than it used to a year ago. Only 6% rejects opposed to 50%. But, those 6% may be nothing for you, its definitely not for large scale miners, who's got hundreds or even thousands of miners running. Its a pure business venture. Why would I switch to p2pool with 5.5% less profit? It doesn't make sense. I really hope that it could be improved to at least 1%, so I could consider it for use, at least as a backup pool.

8 digits decimals means it can be 'almost' free to send the funds. At this point bitcoin miners can afford to add free tx's, its just that the fees were increased at some point to prevent the blockchain from being littered with spam (satoshi dice, 1 satoshi tx's with messages and etc.)
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:53:59
it would take dozens of millions of dollars to make enough hash rate, or being a pool operator and compromise your rep and millions in profits (pool fees) you loose once everyone knows you've done it. And it doesn't look like any pool of single entity on the network is even capable of doing that. So, stealing a tank of gas using xx$m equipment? Yeah, sure =)))

"There used to be this saying amongst us PM bugs, mainly refering to ETFs or gold in vaults in Zurich or Perth: if you don't hold it, you don't own it. "
So true. Personally, I don't get the idea of storing bitcoins anywhere but your own cold storage. I mean, its so easy and doesn't require you to have the key kept in a metal box. The key could take virtually any shape or form, be encrypted, have multi signature for decryption, and multi signature for signing transactions.  Why on Earth you'd give your savings to someone else?
@_date: 2014-07-11 17:49:08
Its not really about saving more. Its about making more rational decisions when it comes to spending. Every bitcoin spent has more value because you kind of vote with every purchase for the product or service you buy.

Its against the law or very expensive to hold gold in some countries. For example, in Russia you have to pay an equivalent of VAT (or GST) when you sell your gold. This law removes any incentive to buy gold in the first place. Many governments don't want people to accumulate wealth for apparent reasons, and bitcoin could turn the tide back. Its very hard to control btc trade offline, that's why governments fear bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-10-30 10:11:26
Exactly. The fact that whales want to buy cheap, btc price is controlled by only a few exchanges online, and the fact that you can buy bitcoins offline, outside of exchanges creates an opportunity to short real hard and make money out of thin air. The only problem is, it won't last long, because PoW currency has a break-even point so to speak - mining cost. When those greedy bastards hit that point the currency will collapse and the rest of crypto as well. The only way to stop this is to somehow make all cross currency trade (crypto/fiat) pseudonymous but public. I have a hunch that CIYAM's AT might be the answer.

He won't get the money back, nor the same equivalent in bitcoins. Check this website  helps to calculate ROI. Every miner bought today and delivered in a few weeks won't ever break even, unless your electricity is free. At the current exchange rate of bitcoin, most hash rate in the bitcoin network is running at a loss waiting for bitcoin to go up in price. If it doesn't within a couple of weeks, hash rate will plummet down, that might cause rate to go down as well. Bitcoin might survive that, or not. I'm not making this up just to troll everyone, I had to turn off my farm because its not profitable any more. Check the numbers yourself. So, if you want to support bitcoin, don't buy hardware, invest in bitcoins ;)

p2pool is inefficient. Current asic hardware would throw out 50% of its work, meaning twice less hash rate and profit for miners. Find another way to decentralise mining and people will follow :)

its often called opportunity costs. If you have a certain amount of funds enough to buy only one thing out of a few things you'd like to buy, all other things you don't buy are the opportunity costs. The point here is, your customers make that choice *before* the purchase. They are aware that buying that product would make them loose the opportunity to profit from future btc value, and as noted above all your prices are in USD anyway. Bitpay should be able to come up with a way to do the refunds back to btc at the current spot market price. Good luck =)

Its not nonsense. I took average prices and besides we all know where majority of hashing power is located. Its China, Iceland, US and a few other countries. You could investigate costs for each mining node but I think we get the picture anyway. You should also take into account cooling electricity costs (which is usually 1/3 to 1/2 usage of the ASIC equipment itself), space rent, salary if any and etc. I've been mining large scale until summer this year, so I know what I'm talking about.

Yes, fungibility might be a problem, but we're not talking about days or weeks, its a matter of hours. Liquidity variable might be linked to current block sizes, so TXs have cooldown only if blocks are getting full. This is something to consider.

Except, of course, that its dev's don't allow it to scale by keeping the block size limit and not using something like sharding, to keep the blockchain size in sane limits. Otherwise its perfect.
@_date: 2016-03-07 21:59:27
Lower block size limit? Seriously, or just trolling?
IMHO the whole debate is nonsense, when you look at the way DDOS attack on bitcoin network is done, and variables available to Core Devs. It's possible to limit the liquidity of bitcoin network, thus stopping blocks getting spammed with tiny transactions, without affecting any genuine user. All spam TXs are chained together, leading from one address to another, so essentially same bitcoins are tossed again and again at maximal velocity quickly filling all blocks. If we could set a cool down time, for the newly received bitcoins, which doesn't allow you to spend it for some time (say, an hour or a couple of hours). Then set a multiplier effect to that variable, so if someone is trying to move same bitcoins as fast as possible, each time it gets moved to a new address the receiver has to wait longer and longer time. This effect can be avoided if the receiver waits for more time (say 6-12 hours), then multiplier is reset to shortest wait time. Most people don't move bitcoins like spammers (with exception to bitcoin mixing services), so I don't see why not implement this into bitcoin algorithm. 
P.S.: It should allow to use 1mb blocks for some more time, until core devs finally agree on something =)

That's why there should be literally only one blockchain sharded and shared among all bitcoin nodes. There would be no need to store entire chain on every node.

Some news about storage demand these days:
Russian government is planning to force all cellular and internet providers to keep customer's data (calls, emails and etc) for 3 years, which is around 157 exabytes of storage needed. According to Storj, all domestic storage available in the world today is around 250 exabytes (which could be shared via Storj if its widely adopted). If Russian ISPs would build their own DCs for such task, it would cost around 1/3 of Russia's annual budget.

I think I know how to come up with the right docs for them to verify your account, without having to obtain a new travel passport. Almost every exchange would actually ask you the same docs for AML and KYC purposes, so I can tell you what I've done to pass verification at Bitstamp, which should be enough for you. 
1. make a translation of your passport and other docs, like driver licence/ electricity bill into English. (make sure its certified, i.e. the guy has a Diploma).
2. Go to the Notary and make your copies notarised  (sawn together sheets, stamps and all that)
3. post all those notarised copies to Cryptsy and hope that they're actually honest about their verification process.

Charlie Shrem had an AMA here a few days ago. I also have(!) this kind of issue, where my mtgox codes went missing and bitinstant did not respond for almost 3 weeks. Charlie then refunded $500, and another $500 he decided to keep. I can't find any other explanation, since no one of the bitinstant team responds to emails or comments here on reddit. Beware of using that service. Its not customer friendly, and many people report funds missing for weeks and months. For me, its been over a month now.

First, you need to open and get verified on all major exchanges. 
Then, after transferring funds to those exchanges, proportionally to their average trade volume you can *sarcasm on*:
1. DDoS MtGox and a few other key websites, like blockchain.info, bitcointalk.org until the btc price drops like hell and buy up.
2. Post false news about dangers about to happen to the bitcoin network and buy low.
3. Slowly buy some bitcoins worth 300-350kUSD then sell at once or in two steps at the right time, when the price is not so strong. Buy low.
4. A combination of strategies  off*
P.S. Please do not use any of these strategies, some of them are illegal....but that's what I've been seeing happening for the last few months. I guess somebody did invest a few million bucks in bitcoin.

the real figure is around $12m. If you develop your own asic chips. However, by the time you deploy all your devices, you'll need a lot more hash power due to constant difficulty increase. I'd say it takes $20m to attack within 8 month period.

It can be done in a more elaborate way. Use nmc to notify about your wallet withdrawals, and set bitcoin wallet to proceed with the transfer only after a certain number on confirmations in a nmc blockchain, enough for the owner to know that the transaction is about to commence. Since nmc's are merged mined, everyone can mine them and support "safe transfers" in bitcoin chain. This is as safe as it gets. Up vote this if you like the idea please =)

@_date: 2013-04-07 11:30:06
IMHO, comparing bitcoin adoption to debit card adoption is a more relevant comparison. Bank accounts as well. Maybe also p2p communication over the internet in general and torrent usage, although most p2p communication over the Internet is available for free. Bitcoin is certainly not a bubble that is doomed to collapse, but the demand is so high, that we do experience small bubbles on the way up.

Don't mine with nVidia cards, not even altcoins. You're going to spend more money on electricity bill than the coins you get in return. Its ASIC's era now, 2nd and 3rd generation already. But as an early adopter and a miner, I can tell that I wish I just bought the coins. Its much more profitable.
@_date: 2013-06-16 14:19:27
The fact that asic miners are able to outgun gpu miners doesn't mean that the hash rate distribution is becoming centralised. Someone could be owning a few ASICminer shares, and using your logic be considered to be a monopolist =)). Get real, its just an adoption phase of the next gen technology.

I've started using bitstamp, and just received my first withdrawal to my bank account. It took a few days to clear. The downside with bitstamp at the moment, is that your bank might ask you for papers proving the source of funds, and bitstamp doesn't have any user/customer agreements.

According to Luke (developer of bfgminer) its even easier to attack p2pool than a regular pool. Each node has a lot less bandwidth and protection tools than pool servers with expensive anti-ddos protection. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:18:57
Absolutely right. This is a solution which could be applied to "savings wallets". Your bitcoin wallet is coupled with namecoin wallet, and no btc transaction can be processed until a specified number of confirmations of nmc transaction to a specified address have passed. It could be either a default number or specified by wallet owner (preferably owner). It should give you enough time to stop the "real" btc transfer. You don't have to have much nmc, but then namecoins could be put to some real use. This doesn't have to be for all wallets. You could still keep your normal wallet without nmc coupling.  I think there are ways to make it work.

just open a troll box on btce and you'll know straight away. People there are being duped and lied to so the attacker could buy cheap. Plain simple. Because Gox cut the trade, instead on letting the attacker to manipulate the price on gox, the attacker was left with only choice - is to troll btce users. 
P.S. btce is the second largest exchange after gox, based on trading volume estimates

I just got one of two missing coupons deposited into my btce account. Thank you. Will wait for another to be deposited into bitstamp account. Of course, I've lost profits of x2.5 times increase in btc value since evening of 22 March. I doubt you're going to compensate that one, but I guess learning from your own experience does have a cost.
All of this **could** be avoided if everyone had an account at bitinstant (or at least an option to have one), and email notifications for all transactions, including failed ones. And of course your biggest issue is support staff. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:32:15
Look Charlie, it logged like a month ago. I've contacted support, and Seth made a couple replies asking for details, then he was gone. No answer, dead silence. I forwarded all emails to all members of your company and when you asked me here on reddit, I forwarded you those emails again. Either you didn't read them (why asking about support if you know that the correspondence is dozen emails long now?), or you just mocking me. Either way, my patience is almost up. $500 is not much to loose, but I'll go after justice. I've heard US courts are quite efficient at what they do.

Getting bitcoin accepted in as many places as possible, is more important than building a network of ATM's. While you can't completely avoid using fiat currency, simply because you have to pay your employees and taxes in local currency. However, bitcoin has its potential to become traveller's money and  currency for Internet purchases. Existing money exchangers might become interested in bitcoin very soon, because of its well known properties in handling transactions.

I've opened a support ticket before trying to cash out less than 5k USD, asking if they really resumed wire transfer withdrawals. After getting a very clear confirmation, I made a withdrawal, but after waiting for more than 3 business days it became apparent that it was a lie. I opened another ticket to ask again if they can process that withdrawal or should I cancel it. They responded with a question asking me if I confirm cancellation of that withdrawal. No comments, no information. I cancelled withdrawal, bought bitcoins and transferred to my wallet. That was my last transaction with MtGox. I think its more like a zombie exchange - still works, but totally useless.

Bitcoin still can prosper during a war only with some conditions:
1. Its not a nuclear world war. In case of WW3 entire planet is doomed. There would be no one to use bitcoin.
2. During a war, the Internet does not get fragmented or blocked in countries with major planetary population and Internet penetration rates.
P.S. the likely scenario a few weeks ago was, that there would be a conflict between Koreas, then China attack Taiwan, Pakistan&lt;&gt;India, and it all starts with Israel attacking Syria, with the help from US (as usual). Then all realise they don't have enough oil, and the last place left on planet is next to North Pole, which is claimed by many countries atm, including Russia. There you go, everyone is busy fighting each other and banksters are making money (as usual).

Encrypted wallet that binds the private key to be used with that particular software. Your regular password is just to initiate transactions. But the pass for the second layer of encryption that binds the key to this software is not accessible even to the owner, once created.

@_date: 2013-04-27 20:35:18
The idea was to use 2 different passwords for initiating the transaction, and for private key itself, giving the client software time to broadcast about the transaction which is about to commence on the namecoin blockchain. Attacker won't have access the private key itself, if he haven't got the second stronger pass. But as ButterflySammy noted, the private key that software would be using has to be stored somewhere too...so, its a dead end...is it?

If one would would really be interested in buying $1m worth of coins, the best way is to slowly buy on falls of exchange rate, again - on all major exchanges.

Ok, here is the last letter I've sent you over a week ago:
Hello Seth,
I already provided you with a long list of QuoteIDs I have in my browser history. I can do that one more time if you wish. Here is a repost of previously sent letter in regards to missing fund transfer from mtgox.com to btc-e.com:
I went through all orders recorded in my browser history, and got 12 orders, 2 of which has failed. But I also used btc trader application, and after using some codes there I saw that they aren't appearing on my btc-e account, so I used some codes second time on your website. That could explain failed order issue. But one code is still missing. Here is a list of QuoteID's I have:
And 2 failed orders:
Here is a list of mtgox codes used for those transfers:
Some of the codes I used to transfer using mybtc trader application from here:  Which is unfortunatelly doesn't save a history of orders. I could only retrieve this one Quote Id from its .ini file:   
The second missing fund transfer is from mtgox.com to bitstamp.com. Here is a repost of the letter regarding that issue:
I've tried to move funds from mtgox to bitstamp with $500 codes. This particular code failed 4 times: MTGOX-USD-W2NWG-P8659-JUSEC-44974, but nevertheless withdrawn from my mtgox account by you. I haven't got those funds on bitstamp. This is a second code missing, totalling in $1000 of missing funds. I'm contacting mtgox support, because I haven't got a singe letter from you."
I went through my browser history, and here is a list of QuoteIDs I have for transfers to bitstamp:
Here is a full list of mtgox codes used for transferring funds from mtgox.com to bitstamp.com:
MTGOX-USD-W2NWG-P8659-JUSEC-44974 &lt; this one is missing
As previously stated above, the last code I've tried to use 4 times, while getting a failed order message, it means 4 QuoteIDs are for the same mtgox code out of that list (probably last ones).
Since not all QuoteIDs could be retrieved, I can also provide you with additional information about my accounts used. 
For security reasons I'm not providing here the last bit of that letter with my MtGox, btce and bitstamp account names, but you had it all this time.

PayPal works in favour of the buyer, and bitcoin might be a good alternative to use for the sellers on eBay. Its open source, with strong and free support, almost 0% fees.
