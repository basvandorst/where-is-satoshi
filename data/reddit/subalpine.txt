he is making fun of how much crypto and blockchain are buzz words for selling junk right now

lol did you see the big post they had wishing Ver a happy birthday the other day?
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:39:09
They act like they don't look at him as a leader, but I mean come on, these posts are just weird and sad. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:16:56
well a few things, 1. something selling doesn't mean it isn't junk 2. I'm not saying that the flamethrower IS junk, just that using buzz words is a good and popular way to sell junk these days

it's aimed at people wanting to send money back home to cuba/mexico/south america
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:59:10
for sure, but businesses seem to be investing more in the future of eth than they are the future of btc. at least as it stands right now. losing steam and stripe support has been a blow even on a personal level.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:50:20
who cares what the 'real bitcoin' is. Eth is creeping up on bcash, and unless bcash starts getting used more and accepted in more locations, it's not going to mean much.
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:30:31
yeah bud this is getting weird. your ego is really indicative of some larger problems I hope you sort out in the years to come. maybe one day you'll learn to be humble and make some friends.

woof that username

how do you expect to get rich if you can't even figure out how to read the sticky at the top of this sub

It was in regards to a state law, and the supreme court just agreed to hear the case as of last month

he should be flattered then
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:52:13
Shilling for what? just other coins? not any specific one? that doesn't make any sense. also rule three is about not posting news articles that don't mention bitcoin, how is that relevant?
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:29:04
transfer it to gdax

That just isn't true. Again, currency doesn't exist in a vacuum, and it is important to at least know what other cryptos are doing. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:35:28
Pointless? you think the price of other cryptos in relation to bitcoin is pointless?? Do you think currencies exist in a vacuum unaffected by other currency and events surrounding that currency?? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:25:03
Did you think bitcoin was somehow exempt from capitalism? The day of idealists died right when the banks started joining in. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:09:13


@_date: 2017-08-22 01:57:23
why do you say that?
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:49:51
jesus christ are you fucking serious? I never said it was a better coin, I just said over the last week it grew a higher percentage. That is just a fucking fact. There is no "everyone should dump their bitcoin and get ether" in anything I said. I was just pointing out a fucking fact. You're insane if you're upset at someone for just casually mentioning a fact. that is burying your head in the sand a disgusting amount.
I never said ether was better, I AGAIN just said that ether grew more than bitcoin in the last week. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:35:12
and that ether pump? what a night. Coinbase was flatlining for almost  an hour.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:01:28
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:27:06
calm down there bucko, giant banks engaging in price manipulation is a way bigger threat to crypto than some wet behind the ears dude asking questions he could easily google.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:57:42
yeah eth has gone up 17.5% since last week, and bitcoin has gone up 11%, so that is something to keep in mind with all these memes.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:06:50
My dad lost a lot of money in the stock market around 2008, and sounds a lot like you do.
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:45:03


This isn't how any currency works-- ever. Especially when people use things like eth when they're pumping and dumping.
Seriously I'm baffled as to how you logically think that what happens with one crypto doesn't in some way affect others. especially the second most popular one next to bitcoin. that doesn't make sense in basic economic terms.
That doesn't even begin to cover processing times and fees and how that is DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE POPULARITY/DIFFICULTY OF OTHER CRYPTOS. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:26:06


You sound like a insufferable human. 'you're welcome'? really? for a dude that just graduated college, you sure have a big ego. Literally nothing would be different if you were never born.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:26:11
yeah same. I have some real egg on my face from every time I've tried to trend buy/sell
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:06:43
a few days ago this would have been downvoted. people really thought it'd drive bitcoin over 5k within a day
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:05:52
was I there? yeah of course I was there. No one seemed to complain when I talked about eth being stuck at 300 for a long time, and litecoin being under 50 forever. I am more interested in discussion on actual facts, no matter what they might be. bitcoin is the top coin for good reason, but that again doesn't mean you should ignore all other alts. that info isn't irrelevant, because we use the daily ups and downs to help forecast where things could be headed. that sort of speculation isn't always accurate, but it is more productive than just spamming the same memes constantly 
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:19:36
booooo get this shit off bitcoin. Spencer is a twat just like Shkreli. I never wanna hear either of their awful names again-- especially on a bitcoin sub. 
It just fell below 4k! is everyone buying?
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:32:06
welp we just went under 4k
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:02:58
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:21:13
You're saying we shouldn't even acknowledge how other crytpos are doing in relation to bitcoin? that is so silly. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:25:44

you forgot everyone yelling HODL constantly 
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:12:44
so if say coinbase gets caught stealing everyone’s money, and the CEO hightails it to Japan, but that’d never happen right?
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:04:07
lol or just maybe a sub dedicated to memes.
