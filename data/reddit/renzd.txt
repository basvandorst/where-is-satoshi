You are right, friend. I overstated it. It's just really rough to see people literally starving next door and knowing there's not really much any one person can do about it, and then find out donations have gone to people whom have never even been to the place, you know?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:58:20
Venezuelan here. This is becoming very common. I posted recently on r/vzla asking for donations to be banned and any type of monetary exchange to be done from a very skeptical approach because nothing is worse than people taking advantage of the sutation countries like Venezuela are going through.

If they haven't already.

This is true. 
I am living in Venezuela. A McFlurry for example, used to be less than 1 dollar a couple of weeks ago, the new price as of 2 days ago is of nearly $2.25. It used to be cheap to live here if you were earning dollars but now the prices are skyrocketing to above global market levels. Mind you, the minimum wage right now is standing strong at a whopping $2.65. So people can literally work extra hours all month and still not be able to afford a couple of sundaes. 
Internet service last month was $7 for a 10 MB connection. This month's bill is going to be $82.50 for the same service... Which isn't even decent. I have no idea how I'm going to pay it yet. But I need to, I'm mining using it. It's my whole family's main source of income. The profits are nearly a fifth of what they used to be earlier in the year but I still make more in a day than what some people make in a trimester here.
Let that sink in.

It's getting insane in here.
I remember just about a month ago I thought of taking a small barbecue grill and making hot dogs for the kids who are usually hanging around the square, begging, selling pens/candy trying to get a few Bs. But for the first time the pricing seemed outlandish to me... Buns and hot dogs used to be so affordable literally a couple of days back. Now the hot dogs alone were more than a month's paycheck and I'm talking about the simplest, common, standard 20 sausage pack. Even whilst earning a few hundred dollars now, it is hard work to stretch it out over the whole month because it's getting to a point where food and basic goods are retailing for over international level pricing but the wages and basic services are the poorest/lowest in the world. 
It's literally a kill or be killed economy fueled by bad policy and horrible management from the government, not to mention the sky high homicide rates. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:40:49
$3 is about 3 million Bs. As of now, a poor family could probably afford a few kg of beans and some rice with that money.
The main issue is: there are very few accountable organizations which are receiving and spreading these donations. There have been records of non profit organizations taking staged pictures of people receiving the goods to then take those away after the picture and instead just give them a minimal fraction of the money donated in exchange for their silence.

The CLAP project has been going on for a couple of years now but in that whole time, I've only seen about 5 or 6 of these boxes which are supposed to be delivered on a monthly basis.

Venezuelan here. You don't understand. Our banks were literally down. Transactions were iffy at best. For the most part, we resorted to using cash $ and BTC in exchange for food and water. I don't like carrying around cash in the worlds most dangerous country, so I did not have any but I used BTC to buy ice, flashlights 
 and a first aid kit at a couple stores that accepted it. Not worth losing your mind over it but it was very satisfying to be able to rely on BTC at a time of crisis. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:42:21
I see your point... but then again, I don't think you can make up the shitshow we are living in Venezuela.
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:32:32
Even if you remove that fact, the point remains the same. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:41:41
Yeah, I have my wallet on my phone. 
My family has a generator and I have a satellite connection. We put the two together and managed to stay connected during the blackout. 
Cellphone towers flared for a few minutes before blacking out for hours during the blackout.
Everything is back to normal now. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:00:57
Ever heard of generators and satellite connections?

Absolutely right, when they get mysteriously "hacked" in a few weeks, don't come crying because you didn't learn from the countless times this idiocy has been committed by ignorant people. 
Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Might as well be Stanley Nickels if you have no control over them or have the ability to store them safely.

Venezuelan here. The government initially jailed about 10 miners in Carabobo because they were connecting their ant miner rigs straight to electricity poles, causing the electricity to be distributed unevenly and erratically at the local grid. Their neighbors complained to the company and they came and jailed them, siezed the equipment. Since then the government has actually encouraged mining and, although I don't agree with it at all, created a registry to detail equipment types and locations of the equipment being used by Venezuelans to mine. Obviously barely anyone registered, but still. Just thought I should clear a few things. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:37:23
Absolutely, friend. We run the operation from an undisclosed location that is not affiliated in any way to the business. I only mentioned it as means to evidence the experience we have with the hardware aspect of such a set up. Thanks for your concern!
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:50:03
It had been declared illegal initially but has now become legal and even encouraged. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:57:52
Yup. They are now setting up farms at every college and created the first Crypto currency observatory in South America. I'm thinking that if cryptos help Venezuela get out of the critical situation it's in, even if it only helps it marginally, it will be a huge boost for the Blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:30:36
Haha, nah. I just thought it would be a service people from other countries would be interested in given electricity here is free. We've only sold the processing power to nicehash and before that we experimented a little bit with Ethereum.

That's why I mentioned the fact I have all the evidence for everything I'm saying ready for anyone with a serious interest to see. But you are right, be very wary of every and all posts regarding crypto exchange in Venezuela. Many people have run scams asking for donations and making up stories on this sub and on r/vzla

Prices have remained relatively stable in comparison to the past few years BTC has been available. I think they'd request BTC knowing full well there's a chance that they might be getting 2-5% less in say a week's time but, probably, 50%+ increase by the end of the year.

One dollar is roughly equal to 800.000 Bs as of today.

Most people who are earning minimum wages don't have time or realistic access to BTC. Some of them, I'm sure, can every now and then buy in a few bits but they are not the average users. Business owners getting paid in BTC the equivalent of the fixed dollar prices on their goods and then exchanging that BTC into $ or Bs are the people who are making these transactions.

How are you doing this? A family acquaintance has approached us several times about it but I usually dismiss it as I believe it's probably illegal. Are you getting them out legally or via tourist visas and requesting asylum?

I'm a 28yo venezuelan living in Venezuela. 
It is easily accessible for people - You only need localbitcoins and a bank account, any bank account. 
Further adoption is prevented by crime and electrical issues, I'd say. Most people now are basically using burner phones (only used for calling and texting) anticipating the fact they are very likely to get mugged at any given point. Additionally, power cuts and so on probably limit the amount of transactions we can realistically perform.
A lot of people know about BTC but not in depth, I wouldn't say "most" people know about it. Mainly business owners and traders. I trade BTC for people who get paid via BTC and come to me directly instead of Localbitcoins as I usually pay a higher rate.

There's a fairly organized community of Dash and Ripple users near my area. They schedule meetings, workshops and seminars every couple of weeks. Even though those aren't really considered stablecoins, that's about as close as it gets for crypto alternatives.
@_date: 2019-05-21 06:10:03
As a trader, my circle's BTC involvement is at 100%. However, when I'm out and about I ask about BTC at stores as form of payment or exchange, those who know, let alone accept, are very few and far between.
@_date: 2019-05-21 06:16:29
See... I feel there isn't as intense opposition to the fees in BTC here in Venezuela. At the end of the day, inflation is so high that people are just looking to get the money from point A to point B as fast as they possibly can. Meaning: those already minimal fees are not only taken into consideration off hand when doing a transaction but also, nearly instant wires are a way better alternative than transferring money to other bank accounts the regular way and having to wait days sometimes for it to reflect on the receiving acc, heavily devaluating the initial amount.

I went to college in the States. I always wanted to come back here, though. For better or worse, I love parts of my country. Admittedly, those parts are growing more and more dangerous as the days go by but I have been thinking about the possibility of going back to the US. I guess the main deterrent is obviously the money I'd have to come up with whilst not being able to work legally and the fact I have no one there whom I could go to for help.
