Bwahahahahahahahaha. 
Funniest shit I've read all month.

Don't you mean the other way around?

May I ask why you are the only one to support litecoins? Are you the only provider seeing their huge potential alongside BTC? Even coinbase and gox hasn't acknowledge those silver coins of god...yet.

So....not to the moon?!
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:21:06
Is it wise to buy now, or will post-crash prices be sub 200$? 
Also, how will another crash transpire? You know this absolutely? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:32:37
Can confirm, am stoned bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:44:42
No fucking shit.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:00:48
Is it because of the song "21 Questions" by 50 and RIP his soul Nate Dogg?
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:58:32
It was just 1 but still got me in the feels.
How many have you invested in?

I'm Mexican and there is no difference.

Get your lighters roll that sticky let's get high - got that mBTC and its DAT FIRE.

The game is over I'm literally going to shoot you.

I'd like to give that news reporter my investment tip.
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:32:55
The bubble is going to pop? 
How low will it go do you think?
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:25:50
But there were never as many news stories on it, were there? Nor was there an announcement of a new CEO starting a 9M company founded on the concept of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:24:10
So even if it did pop, it would probably never go below 170$ ever again is what you're saying...
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:52:59
Outstanding work, you guys are at least 3-5 years ahead of the game. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:49:12
An astute observation has led to enlightenment!

I sold my BTC at 345 and have been weeping since.
Enjoy your yummy food

I, for one, welcome our new Chinaman overlords.

Don't you dare break the circlejerk! 10,000 per BTC by 2014, and stuff.

What do you mean by this? 
Are you telling me BTC is going to crash, or inflate in a couple of weeks?
