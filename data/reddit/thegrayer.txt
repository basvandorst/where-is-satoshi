Sigh. I just wanted to share my experience, so take it or leave it.
For what it's worth, I have been an active contributor at bitcointalk.org since 2010. For privacy reasons I will not disclose my nickname here but I would be happy to send a PM to a veteran bitcointalk member who can then reconfirm this on reddit (any volunteers?). Would that be proof enough for you that I am not lying about being an early adopter?

The law requires the bank to do this for any asset of unknown source. If a restaurant asks you to stop smoking because of anti-smoking laws is it the restaurant that is being hostile? 
If we are going to use that definition of hostility, yes then of course the bank is hostile towards bitcoin but that is because it's hostile towards *everything*.

It's not game over, it just complicates things.

They said that a bank statement showing a EUR transaction to a bitcoin exchange would suffice. 
They didn't really demand hard proof, more like supporting evidence for the declaration that I signed.

Yes, I reside outside the US. 
As of crypto-anarchist privacy rights, yeah, if you want those then you have to keep 100% of your wealth in Crypto and I guess I don't have the balls for that :)

Yes, unfortunately you have to be prepared to have your privacy violated if you don't want to go 100% crypto. 
But even then ... I was surprised that the bank was prepared to have me as a customer *at all*. 
What if you couldn't prove the source of the coins? Then it's probably a bad idea to sell them on Bitstamp in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 00:34:53
So are you saying that the *mere* fact that someone is selling bitcoins on bitstamp is suspicion enough to seize funds?  Do you know of any cases where this has actually happened?  
Scary shit. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:32:25
No, I definitely never touched anything to do with the US.

Yet there have been quite a few stories of private Bitcoin users having their accounts terminated or frozen for trading relatively small sums.

Yes I asked, "what if I didn't have a proof of purchase for *any* of my bitcoins" and the answer was, "It would complicate things.  We have been monitoring the price of bitcoin and we would require some kind of proof of ownership at a time when the price was much lower."
@_date: 2014-10-18 07:34:58
That wouldn't have been a problem. 
They just wanted proof that I bought or owned X worth of bitcoin at a time when the price was much lower.   
They didn't want to track the *specific* bitcoins that I had sold at bitstamp.
If you tumbled your bitcoins *and* you have no proof of purchase *and* lost your original wallet then it might be a problem.  I have no idea what they do in such situations. Perhaps they require statements from witnesses? 
Another lesson from this is **never delete any of your historic wallets**.

No I'm not from the US. I'm not a banking expert and to be honest I can't remember the *exact* words of the manager but that is the gist of what they said. 
I found it a bit odd too. This is just a wild guess: UniCredit is a huge bank and they might be nervous about losing business in the US, which *has* been acting very aggressively against foreign banks, as this example illustrates:

a) Throwaway account for privacy reasons.
b) Actually I also sold many bitcoins at the *wrong* times during last 4 years, it's just that the Dec 2013 bubble was the first time I made large enough withdrawals to draw attention from the bank.
c) I'm sorry the dialogue above doesn't come across as believable, but I assure you it happened. Look, I'm not the most talented of writers and maybe some of it was lost in translation (the original didn't happen in English). I have also left some parts out for the sake of brevity. It's not word for word.

The bank is UniCredit.  That's as much detail as I am willing to disclose.
