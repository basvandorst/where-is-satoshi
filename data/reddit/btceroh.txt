Don't bring traffic to his bullshit
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:33:47
Ill make this simple.
Lets say you have two computers.
One is online and holds bitcoin, but isnt allowed to spend them without permission from (mommy) or w/e
The offline computer is (mommy)
So the online computer makes a transaction and asks mom to sign off on buying some cookies or some shit.  
The transaction needs to be signed of by mommy, because only she has the authority to say whether or not its okay to use them. 
So if you had an electrum cold storage wallet  you would make a transaction with the online wallet and you would get an unsigned transaction and put it on a usb or w/e.
You'd take the unsigned transaction to the offline computer and "sign" it.
You'd bring that signed transaction back to the online computer and it would then have the authority to broadcast the transaction.

I mean if there is a reputable wallet that holds them all the only reason not to would be diversifying risk of theft. Jaxx can hold multiple coins but I dont know enough about them and I've never used them.
Personally I'd just use different wallets if I was holding the coins long term.
EDIT: I know literally nothing about Jaxx but look into it.
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:33:45
I've heard good things about bitpay. Its used by Paypal, Microsoft etc... although in capacities other than a debit card.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:55:31
No. Coinbase is an exchange not a wallet. They *have* wallets they use to store  bitcoins but its not *your* wallet.
Literally anyone here will tell you don't store your coin at any exchange for a long period of time.

People do, but I see what your saying.
In my experience a lot of the disparities between exchanges are usually due to the fees and length of time involved in depositing and withdrawing fiat; so the arbitrage isn't usually as good as it seems.
