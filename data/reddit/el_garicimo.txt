Also, whereas theaters are open all year, most drive ins are only open for part of the year, when the weather permits hanging out outside.
Here is another good article about the situation:

Why isn't this dispute resolution being used in the various scams out there? (paypal scam, reversible transactions in general, etc.)
Are is it being used, and I just don't know about it?

Perhaps, but I would argue that the drive ins should be given more lee-way than cinemas--a lot of cinemas are franchises, whereas drive ins are locally owned and (i'm guessing) don't have as high margins as the cinemas.
It would be like if all burger joints across the country suddenly had to buy expensive new cooking equipment, and you expect the smaller independent burger joints that are unique to their specific city's down town to adopt as quick as all the burger kings and mcdonalds and wendy's, etc.
There are only 350  drive ins in the US right now: 
I think it would be relatively easy to investigate which ones were affected by the change from film to digital *edit and are on the verge of closing* if enough people were interested in helping out.

Granted I just found out about this issue and so may not be as well versed about it, but it is my understanding that most Drive in theaters, at least in the US, are Mom and Pop operations. There are only 350 or so left country wide. Do you know if they had the access/ resources to these sorts of deals?
It seems odd that Honda would have sponsored a campaign to "save drive in theaters nation wide" if all of them could have just paid some higher Film rental fees for a couple of years.
