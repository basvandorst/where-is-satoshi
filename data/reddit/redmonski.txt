You can also check out Applebyte - cryptocurrency for artist and musicians. They have AppleByte Music Store coming.

Maybe you can integrate with a local exchange, e.g itBit in Singapore. In the Rebit website there's a summary showing Amount+Rebit fee+Transfer=Total. You should include itBit fee and how much I paid for the BTC from itBit (all converted into peso - at the current exchange rate). So I can see how much is the total cash outflow for sending 1,000 peso to Philippines. Let's say total amount would be 1,020 pesos, that would be significantly below how much the remittance centres are charging here - the lowest I know is around 90 pesos per transaction.
But there's a shortcoming in the Rebit model - the 0.85% Rebit fee and the itBit fee (if you decide to integrate with a local exchange) - they're both as % of the amount. For large remittances, it would be still better for me to use the remittance centres here (I can send a maximum of 10,000 SGD = around 337,500 pesos). Fee charged by remittance centres is a fixed amount per transaction.
I hope Rebit can have a solution to this. : )

I would love to see this implemented in our country.
A census system based on blockchain technology could be the starting point, birth and death registration should be integrated into this census system.

Eventually, cost of remitting money should be almost free. Bitcoin replacing peso would take years. But I'm optimistic, people can think of something that would really disrupt the remittance industry in the near future.

something like UBER model would help the bitcoin remittance industry + colored coins/smart contracts + coinapult / bitreserve.
If colored coins can be fixed in value, then possibly no need for coinapult / bitreserve.
Profit sharing to system participants. Profit would come from voluntary tips/donations by the sender (not service fee).
Platform should be simple for the sender/receiver yet secured.
