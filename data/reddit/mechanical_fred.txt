central banks still use gold as money

Central banks use gold as a store of value and a medium of exchange.  Therefore, central banks use gold as money.

Backed doesn't mean what you think it means.

Gold has value because it is gold.

Backing means that there is a commodity that stands behind the value of a piece of paper.  A car's title has value because it is backed by the car.  A deed has value because it is backed by real estate.
Commodities have value because they are commodities.  Asking what gold is backed by is a nonsensical question.  During the gold standard, gold was not what was backed, gold was the commodity doing the backing.  The bank notes were backed by gold, gold wasn't "backed" because it is not a bank note.  Said differently, the bank notes were valuable because they were exchangeable for gold.  Gold is valuable because it is a commodity.  
tl;dr bank notes are backed, commodities do the backing

It doesn't make any sense to talk about what a house is backed by.  That's what I'm calling awkward.

A house is valuable because it is a house.
You're using the word "backed" in an awkward way.  The term, in this usage, comes from bank notes, which are pieces of paper that formerly were backed by assets.  The bank notes (paper) had value because they were exchangeable for a commodity (usually gold or silver).  If you want to talk about backing in the context of houses, then we also need to talk about paper being exchangeable for a commodity.  The deed to a house (paper) is valuable because it is exchangeable for the house.  The deed is backed by the house.
