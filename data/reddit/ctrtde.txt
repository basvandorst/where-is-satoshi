Actually, until you mentioned I never saw this social media tab. Thanks for the hint.
Still sadly not helping too much: The people that I would support by saying "DO NOT BUY THIS!" actually would not really research a lot. So a One-pager would be perfect ;-)
Hehe, well, maybe with your recommendation I have another subreddit to follow.... ;-) Thanks again!

Thanks - I found this one. What I am missing there is the value proposition and premined coins.
And this would be quite essential for me.
Background: I know some people who just see prices rising of a shitcoin and then they want to buy in, without knowing any background.
For me it would be essential - before considering investment - to know how much of the coins are in the hand of the "inventor" (to see how they can manipulate the market) and what exactly that coin is supposed to do (value proposition).
If it actually has a good use and is not easily to be manipulated by the issuer it might be a better investment than having neither of these properties.
P.S. An integration of these points in coinmarketcap would be awesome ;-)

Just wondering if someone who has more time made something like this and I just did not find it.
Would help a lot when checking alt-coins...
For example: Name, Abbreviation, Cap, Currently in Circulation, Value Proposition, Short History
Mostly the information about different coins is completely distributed everywhere. And to get a very quick overview it might be really helpful...

Thanks, pretty close but missing value proposition and the amount of premined coins....

Just some thoughts that came to my mind today.
Happy to get yours.

Same thought hit me yesterday like a stone when thinking about electronic payment systems in China:

Oh well... also really curious what will happen.
But surely a bit excited - not sure if I am going to like the presents I am going to get ;)
Since it seems that I am missing the right Karma to make a new post with a URL - let me share my thoughts and Comic here:

Still, this is something that came into my mind too. Currently there is a big ban of VPNs in China going on (as long as they are not certified by the chinese government), at the same time we have a lot of ad-hoc changes in the law with big impact on the markets, that it is basically getting impossible to have anonymous internet access and the great firewall. As far as I understood:
- China is dominant in bitcoin mining
- Chinese users play quite a big role in bitcoins
I had a similar arguments with some of my friends and my answer was always: It is impossible to block the bitcoin network itself basically (... is that so?). But it would be possible to make laws that owning, buying and selling of digital currencies is forbidden.
Currently i think it is &lt;20% probability but still possible.
Wouldn't that have a serious influence on bitocoin price?
Would be happy to get your thoughts. Maybe I am also having a wrong thought here.

... While one of the main reasons for the real estate speculation is: there are not many other assets with a perceived high security and still high profitability  available to Chinese people. And capital controls keep the money mostly inside of the country.
Changing the asset class to invest is somehow improbable, but a real estate crash indeed could happen some day.

Suggestions which sources should be added are very welcome ;)

Regarding the payments part: this is the standard in China already with alipay and wechat wallet. Everything being paid by the phone.

I also bought my first ones in July  and started to worry when I had - 30 percent shortly after  in my portfolio. Felt like this:
Since then I am much more relaxed...

IMHO the shortterm-market is quite unpredictable.
Even if you know then where the price went, you have no better clue if "now" is the right time.
Did it go down? "Damn, maybe i should not buy now, this correction will continue".
Did it go up? "Damn, I missed an opportunity".
I just bought shortly before the "crash" in July and already was angry at myself... see also this comic that i made after:

Now it is around 2 months later and my portfolio worth is up a lot.
I dont want to tell you to buy now. But watching does not bring you any benefits i guess. Cost-Averaging might be the way to go if you certainly want to invest.

If you just follow the postings here on Reddit, it seems like everyone is HODLing anyway... ;-)

Maybe I missed something, but: except the price premium, are there other reasons to not trust the exchange?
And how is tether supposed to be connected to it?

In all fairness : a few months ago when BTC was going lower and lower, most of the people claiming BTC would beat ATH became pretty quiet too.

Heey heeey heeeeeyyyyy!
