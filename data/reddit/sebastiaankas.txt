I meant a long timespan. And on a global scale.  Gold is used for trading purposes since written history.

I think so because it's so solid. I would ofcourse love to see crypto replace fiat. But in case of a massive solar flare (for instance) we'll still need something to trade with.

Litebit.eu also works perfect!

Nothing beats gold when it comes to stability.
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:58:27
That is not OK. I've used the service about 10 times and all transactions were in a minute!

The code works! I send a little to show appreciation and round my nr's =D

Yea its an incredible discount, just in anticipation of an 'ultimate' value. But its also symbolic, im not gonna work 40 hours a week like this. For now. If there is an steady increase and i have enough offers who knows.
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:08:28
Whoo didn't know those existed. Thanks!!
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:54:39
Allright! Good too hear.
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:50:57
To bad its almost all tech related, and not in Europe.
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:06:46
Yes, nice one!
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:59:13
Thats what i intend to do, to close the loop. 
Ofcourse there will be a time of transition where both transaction options excist alongside each other. But if more and more people pay one another for services in BTC, i suppose goods wil get valued in BTC aswel.
@_date: 2019-12-10 06:53:10
Nope, only for the milfs!
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:56:02
Haha nice offer. But i will manage perfectly on my own
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:51:22
I indeed saw some quistionable things. But thank you for the reminder!
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:39:34
Nice! I live near Middelburg so its possible. I'll send you my nr.
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:56:49
You've got a point. Will do next time!
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:37:05
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:58:52
Nope, the idea is to stop using € all together.
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:33:51
Haha nice. The more people buying and using, the better! I take the risk with a percentage of my time. And I think the chance BTC rising 14x is more likely than winning with a scratch card. I for one dont gamble.

'the rabobank' doesn't exist.
Its just people working for people working for people, and some of them are impatient, greedy, dumb or lack any productive skill.
I personaly have (an already four year during) affair with this former Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank. I'm Dutch and the bank either owes me 174.000€ or i owe the bank about half that amount. 
Depending on the outcome of the current lawsuit i may or may not go in detail about this case. Either way, it made me rethink the complexity of such organisations.
 Hate and love it just like crypto.

I would like to know if and in what extend  mainstream news coverage on crypto coins influenced the holders and developers via the social construct. In other words: Did the load of (dis)information cause the 'dip' in value and trust?
A nice graph could be helpful, who's got some beautifull data =D ?
