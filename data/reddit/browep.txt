Great job.  Very useful

same for me.  I would rather give coinbase a plaintext key and an encrypted key from an offline comp instead of the other way around.

Where does bitcorati get it's data from?  I know  /  get theirs from open street maps.  Which seems to have the biggest database of brick and mortar stores.   Wouldn't a combination of OSM data and yelp be viable too?  Or does bitcorati offer more than that?

This is wonderful and more than could be expected of congress. I don't know its chances of getting passed but things like this help legitimize crypto currencies in the eyes of a lot of people even if it doesn't.  Even getting it discussed in committee is a win.  Anyone know where this would go next?  Committee? Look for more backers?
If we make noise about it law makers will too.

Is there any sane subreddits for bitcoin?  is pretty dead
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:59:35
is there no middle ground?  I WANT to "push" payments and not have a merchant "pull" them, that's what's attractive to me.  Is there no way to have a customer pay every month?  Why not send an email invoice every month?  I would much prefer that than a merchant hope I forgot I set up recurring billing, that's the point.  I have VPS hosting that invoices me every month for services.  If I don't pay them, they stop giving me those services, makes sense.  If I don't want to have to remember I can buy 6/12 months of service.  There is multi-sig built into bitcoin for a long time now, it's the perfect escrow service.  Why not that?

if you submit it to coinmap.org ( really openstreetmaps ) then it will get picked up by  .  The OSM data is probably the best reference and is crawled by lots of directories so you're really submitting it to lots of sites.
if you're in canada:  
another directory:   has physical and online listings, Australia focused.
Quite a few places can do banner ads, , just-dice.com, other gambling sites that cater to a bitcoin crowd.

understood, but I also get to vote with my bitcoins.  It's good to know if I am supporting a business that is supporting bitcoin or supporting themselves.  That's the beauty of it.  I can take my bitcoins and leave, just want to know what their intent is and this isn't a positive one for me.  
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:31:05
makes sense, it's much easier for Coinbase to do this internally than get things working through the protocol, hopefully they move in that direction, dont know.  For gittip ( and I am sure other merchants, myself being one of them ) integrating using the coinbase api is much easier than running a node and integrating it yourself, worrying about diskspace, node uptime, ddos, hardening, key management, etc.  Although I hope in the near future you'll be able to integrate it much easier into a server/system with off-the-shelf software.

in a 2 of 3 setup you have the parties CUSTOMER, MERCHANT, ESCROW.  Any 2 of those 3 can sign a transaction and send coins.  Let's say we want to do recurring billing, once a month for 12 months.  I can put 12 months of payment into that 2of3 address.  Every month, the MERCHANT requests a payment from the ESCROW for that monthly cycle and provides some documentation.  The escrow does some verification of the documentation ( this is something easily automated ) and releases that months funds using the private key of the ESCROW and MERCHANT.  The user has to do nothing, receives an email about funds paid.  
3 months in, CUSTOMER no longer wants the service.  They tell the ESCROW this, the ESCROW and the CUSTOMER send the rest of the funds back to the CUSTOMER, escrow sends a nice little email about the funds leaving and to cancel service.  
At no point does the CUSTOMER need to commit a full amount completely to the MERCHANT's control.  Nor does the CUSTOMER need to remember to pay every month, can put as much in the escrow as they want.  The CUSTOMER and MERCHANT agreed on an escrow they both like.  The CUSTOMER gets back anything that they haven't used yet and the MERCHANT only needs the ESCROW to release funds instead of the forgetful CUSTOMER.

does that mean that you will need a coinbase account to pay?  will you not be able to pay with any other option?  no QR code, no actual bitcoin address?

i like the idea but you're approach may be a little off, some observations:
* there are two groups, content creators and content consumers and they have very different motivations
* content creators ( specifically the ones you want to attract ) are motivated by money.  You need to advertise in places where people are looking to make money by uploading content, ie not here.  Bitcoin is great fit here because the barrier for paying and getting paid is so low.  Good choice.
* content consumers, could give 2 shits how the content got there, how the uploaders are getting paid or who's video it actually is.  They want content that's easy to find and plentiful.  Advertising that its "bit-something" makes no difference.  content is supreme.
* don't confuse those two groups.

probably something that shows you're legit.  Names and investors are a good step but I think people want to know if you're going to walk away with their money.  Addresses and phone numbers help.  Some sort of legal trail.

can't the Android client do this pretty much already?  A simple android phone with no plan can be acquired for about $150.  Or do you think that is still too much of a learning curve?  
I think there is a need for a tutorial site that is geared towards payment receivers and foregoes the technical stuff. 
@_date: 2011-08-25 14:39:32
There is some simple supply-side and demands-side stuff going on here.  On the supply side you have a hoard of coins ( early-adopters ) and steady stream of new ones ( miners ) being sold all the time, this causes the price to go down.  And on the demand side you have a bunch of people who need/want coins ( speculators / people buying drugs/goods ).  Most of the wild speculation is gone, the price drops saw to that but there are still people who will need bitcoins, mostly right now buying drugs.  But the stream of early adopters and people still mining are dropping their coins on the market daily and there are not enough people needing to buy bitcoins to keep the price up,
So what will happen?
The price will continue to drop until enough people are convinced to stop mining ( it becomes severely unprofitable ) so that the number of coins being mined is equal to the number of coins actually needed ( buying drugs , other bitcoin only uses ).   Not really sure where that bottom is but it's there.  From there you will see steady growth.  
@_date: 2011-09-07 20:23:37
right, and for any larger purchase you would have those stipulations about enough money needs to be in an account so that double-spend would be extremely difficult.
@_date: 2011-09-07 04:35:55
I agree, if I buy a coffee or a meal you don't really need to worry about a double spend anymore than you would a credit card chargeback or counterfeit bills.  If the purchase is more than people feel comfortable with then maybe a few stipulations like the account must have at least 4 times as much as the purchase.

didn't a "buy with paypal" service get shutdown by paypal?  Is GC any different?  What is it exactly you are doing about chargebacks?

I guess I thought there was some standard for URI's or maybe that was just for the Android app.  A standard for URI's would be super if it doesn't already exist.  
@_date: 2011-09-06 05:11:04
I don't agree that it's "coercion".  It's more of "hey X business, if you accept bitcoin you will get all these new customers".  It's not a protest for people to stop frequenting if they dont accept.  
I read through  which is what I am assuming you were talking about.  I am not sure I understand how that helps adoption, or maybe it was just all over my head.
@_date: 2011-09-06 05:05:56
I do see that bitcoin is very volatile right now but I don't really know when that is going to change.  Is there some stabilizing feature or event that will be happening soon?  I think it would be wise for any system to take into account this volatility and compensate for it.  Maybe tie prices to the current market rate and dump any bitcoins as soon as they are confirmed?  Wouldn't that take care of the price volatility? 
@_date: 2011-09-12 21:25:07

most of the info is geared towards investor types and leaves out a lot of the technical stuff that I would like to know.  Like, will they be actually buying and holding bitcoins themselves?  How many will they be buying and how often?  What does 1 share equal? 1 share == 1 btc ?  What about price variance between the share price and an exchange price?

good video, albeit sensational.  I donated because I want to support pretty much any and all who are passionate about creating tools to work with bitcoin.  From what I got from the little information they actually show us in the video and the indiegogo project page is that its an implementation of wallet that allows for 
* trustless mixing ( not sure how they just say it does, is it coinjoin  ? )
* obscured identity ( not sure how more obscure you can get than the current hash that represents your wallet )
* open stack ( although i dont know of too many closed stacks in the bitcoin world )
im sure there are answers to my confusion and if I dig deep enough I will answer them but if they want a wider audience to fund them they might want to put more info up there.  The bitcoin community is still mostly techincally literate and doesnt mind at least a small taste of the gory details.
