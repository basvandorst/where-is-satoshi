Don't mine to your ledger. Mine to separate wallet and transfer the funds say, once a week to your ledger.

Not that lol...

You can avoid this potential security threat by calling your provider and tell them that you don't want your number to be ported.

It's about utilities on the network, not the fact that you could play it for free elsewhere.

Nice try, IRS.

That's the way we like to... Conduct transactions?

I dont understand how these rumours even come about if they are always debunked shortly after..

Water actually isn't wet. Water is water, and we associate that with being wet.

You guys are literally all blind. The only reason Bitcoin is pumping this hard is because everyone wants the forked coins. Not to mention the bitcoin gold fork already happened so everyone buying BTC for the fork is screwed.

I like how the "hackers" went through all of the trouble to essentially mine undetected and cover their ass and Tesla just says, "No problem, let me just fix that real quick"... 
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:18:52
Don't be so sure.
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:07:14
Glad I could help, best of luck.

Well for one, I interned with them and can verify they do KYC as I've conducted it personally. Everything is above par, and you have absolutely no idea how many loops you have to jump through to stay legitimate, they are legal if you do your due diligence.

That's a false accusation. The hardware takes live photos.
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:31:30
You're wrong.

Sometimes the user is incapable of following directions on taking a clear picture, and they blame the machine.

During the purchasing process. I'm not really sure what your end goal is.

Child, please.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:02:07
Can someone explain this to me like I'm 5?
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:21:20
21 days is child's play. PayPal held my funds for 6 months without a chance for "premature release".

Saw a 1024 GB microSD the other day.

Dude, what the absolute fuck. I disagree strongly with you decision.
