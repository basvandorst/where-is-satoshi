Bitcoins received *never* come from addresses, so I can literally point to any transaction on the blockchain to make that example.

An attempt to hijack Bitcoin by convincing the community that they must switch to the "Bitcoin Classic" altcoin because 75% of miners insist. (The miners didn't go along with it, so in practice it *mostly* functions as a Bitcoin node for now.)
@_date: 2016-08-20 21:45:14
No. Bitcoins don't come from addresses at all.

They allow honest users to double-spend, instead of only dishonest users. It was never only miners. Honest users don't commit fraud, only the dishonest users who already could double-spend anyway, so it doesn't really increase the risk.
Treating opt-out-of-RBF differently is just a false sense of security.

This would risk fracturing the network, which could result in consensus failure. Besides, there's nothing wrong with creating "non-standard" transactions.

This isn't a Bitcoin problem. It's a computer security problem.
Note it's not enough to verify the Bitcoin binaries are legit - you also need to be sure every other program on your computer is legit.

Considering that difficulty increases quick enough that miners won't even pay for their electric costs a year later, break-even probably needs to be within a few months.

No. Transactions happen consuming a UTXO id, creating new coins which have an executable script to check signatures of the transaction spending them. At a high-level, this is simply transactions from an unknown wallet to an address. There is never a "from" address, and addresses don't hold bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-08-20 23:23:03
You get all those with PayPal. They're not benefits of Bitcoin, just normal features our competitors already have. Bitcoin's unique features all rely on you running your own full node.
While it's *possible* for light clients to have equal or better user interfaces, at present, Bitcoin Core's UI is far better.

If your PC is compromised, the latter is more secure. If not, Bitcoin Core is, since Electrum requires trusting a centralised server. For the best security, you'd want to run your own Electrum server (based on Bitcoin Core) and use a Trezor (or maybe Trezor will finally add Bitcoin Core support some day..)

Some miners prioritise transactions spending older coins. But even aside from that, miners have different policies - some might consider your fee too low, but others accept it.

Probably Canonical/Ubuntu. I would not trust it more than you trust Ubuntu. But PPAs are generally only for Ubuntu, so you're presumably already trusting Canonical if you use them, so might as well assume it's legit in that case.

Litecoin is NOT a good example of a mere software fork, since it changes the consensus code. Rather, an example of this would be Bitcoin Knots or Satoshi RBF.
Should note that softforks are only ever deployed when quick success is certain (95% of miner support).
The hardfork description is basically wrong. With a hardfork, it is (sometimes) possible the old chain with more work can kill off the forked chain. If the old chain continues to be used, it is furthermore an altcoin rather than merely a fork - otherwise, Feathercoin and Litecoin would merely be hardforks of Bitcoin.
Many of the examples of when hardforks are required, can in fact be done with softforks. In particular, most network abuse can be prevented with softforks, and segwit is a softforked block size limit increase.

Both of those fall in the category of malicious when performed against the production network. Testnet exists for a reason.
Besides, the only thing the network *can* do about it is up the fees. Or get the miners to use smarter spam filtering.
@_date: 2016-08-24 06:01:52
Accepting payments through a watch-only copy *is* safe, so long as you're running a full node for it.

@_date: 2016-08-28 22:38:56
It's simple *when consensus is had to make a change*. Desire for a block size increase hardfork has never had that, and been at most a minority of the community.
@_date: 2016-08-18 07:04:11
Might be interesting to add a DHT to the p2p network which is rate limited by Bitcoin spending/ownership. So instead of the fee getting N bytes on-chain, you get N bytes on-chain *and* N bytes off-chain. But I'm not sure how useful this is. :)
More useful would probably be to revive some searchable p2p filesharing system and add support for multi-party signed files.
@_date: 2016-08-23 20:59:10
Politics. And apparently there's a belief that miners won't follow good advice anyway, so it's a waste of time to even discuss giving it. (I disagree, and think that even if it gets ignored in the end, we ought to give advice that is good for Bitcoin.) There's also a valid point that by the time segwit activates, compact blocks will probably make these bigger blocks a non-issue - but that's yet to be seen in practice.
@_date: 2016-08-15 06:53:46


Bitcoin Knots is AFAIK the *only* node software that allows you to set the policy you are asking for. Every other one (including Core, Classic, XT, and Unlimited) has spam filtering mandatory and impossible to disable.
This should do it:
    spamfilter=0 acceptnonstdtxn=1 prematurewitness=1 mempoolreplacement=fee,-optin strictbytespersigop=0 relaypriority=1 limitancestorcount=4000000 limitancestorsize=4000000 limitdescendantcount=4000000 limitdescendantsize=4000000 minrelaytxfee=0.00000001 maxmempool=4000000 mempoolexpiry=4000000 permitbaremultisig=1 limitfreerelay=4000000 datacarrier=1 datacarriersize=4000000
But the result of the network adopting such a policy will almost certainly be very high fees. Spammers are almost always willing to pay more than legitimate transactions.
@_date: 2016-08-23 19:23:04

On principle, major Core releases never include the code for activating network changes, as that could be perceived as forcing the network change on the community.
@_date: 2016-08-23 07:38:37
If you're running a light client, then anyone can send you random garbage and you'll blindly accept it. You have no reason to trust the random node you've connected to is checking it.

There's quite a few organisations, but none formally/legally non-profit AFAIK (maybe MIT DCI is?), and pretty much all the important ones work on Bitcoin Core (which is a project, not a team).

@_date: 2016-08-02 17:53:31
Since X.X includes only the network change, the community is not pressured to adopt it because of other features they might want. In other words, they get exactly the same features without the network change in X.(X-1)

1. Already have a trusted OS and PGP implementation. (Good luck bootstrapping...)
2. Create a PGP keyring for yourself.
3. Go to a Bitcoin meetup and meet some people.
4. Have those people give you their PGP key fingerprints in person.
5. Go home and have your PGP keyring download their keys from a keyserver.
6. Verify the key fingerprints match what you got from them.
7. Sign and set their keys as trusted in your keyring.
8. Download untrusted Bitcoin binaries from somewhere (it doesn't matter where).
9. Download signed SHA256SUMS file for those Bitcoin binaries from somewhere (it doesn't matter where).
10. Use your PGP implementation to verify the signature on the SHA256SUMS file. If you don't have a path of trust to the release key, go to another Bitcoin meetup and jump back to step 3 until you do.
11. Use the standard sha256sums tool to verify the Bitcoin binaries you downloaded match the hash in the SHA256SUMS file.
12. You now know that the file is signed by someone you supposedly trust, or someone they trust.

Bitcoin does not, and indeed *cannot* (and I'd dare to even say *should not*), prevent a government from banning its use within their borders. All it takes is a law declaring use of Bitcoin illegal, and then all law-abiding citizens will refuse to accept it as payment.
The important thing is that large organisations cannot turn into governments themselves, and that governments cannot interfere with other jurisdictions.
@_date: 2016-08-18 05:02:30

That's the weak link for basically all crypto schemes. How do you know the address you're paying is the right one? How do you know the server's SSL cert is right?
The answer for SSL/TLS is that you trust a centralised group of "certificate authorities".
The answer for PGP is that you use it yourself, and verify people you know in person; they verify people they know, and you end up with a web of trust. So make a PGP key, and whenever you're at a Bitcoin conference or meetup, coordinate key signing. Verify with each individual their own key fingerprint (*not* just the short id) and sign their key.
@_date: 2016-08-24 18:00:15
It doesn't work like that. The network relies on a supermajority of payment acceptance running their own node. Not merely an absolute number.

Not even that. It's entirely possible, albeit unlikely, that all those 140,000 addresses are in fact individual people, and that the next 8% of bitcoins are held in 10+ BTC quantities by different people. :)
It's also entirely possible that some of those funds last received by an address are shared by multiple people.
I believe the upper bound for number of people with over 10 BTC today therefore works out to be 15,247,397 total BTC / 10 BTC per person = 1,524,739 people.

The most important thing a full node does to help the network, is being used to accept payments from other people. Uptime doesn't matter much at all beyond when you're using it.
(There are other ways nodes can contribute, but those resources aren't lacking on the network.)
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:41:04
Balances don't exist in the Bitcoin protocol at all. There are just UTXOs with a value, which can be spent, but never changed.

That math would work *if* compact blocks were already widely deployed, *and* this was an unusually low outlier bandwidth, *and* he wanted to dedicated his entire internet connection to Bitcoin.
None of those are the case today. Without compact blocks, relay nodes need to download and upload the full block to multiple peers in a matter of seconds. Even in NYC the internet connection was "really slow" (in your terms), and numerous people with better bandwidth have voiced their concern that their monthly bandwidth limits may be exceeded in block sizes increase too early. And I don't think anyone wants a dedicated internet connection just for Bitcoin.

If someone has a quantum computer, chances are they can double-spend you much faster than your initial transaction gets relayed. In other words, the one miners see first is *probably* going to be the QC double-spend.

1. There is no such thing as "from" in Bitcoin.
2. There is *especially* no such thing as a "from" Bitcoin address.
3. Addresses should never be used more than once ever.

Nodes have multiple possible ways to contribute:
* Relaying transactions: this contributes to Bitcoin's original L2 network, but there are far more nodes doing it than Bitcoin ever needs.
* Relaying blocks: this contributes to Bitcoin's L1 network's censorship-resistance. It is currently a lost cause due to blocks being so large that centralised block relay is required for mining.
* Mining blocks: this contributes to Bitcoin's L1 network's censorship-resistance and decentralisation, so long as the miner isn't a large portion of the overall mining hashpower. It is currently a lost cause due to mining centralisation.
* Making transactions: this contributes to Bitcoin's overall economic use. It's more than sufficient right now.
* Receiving transactions with a light client: this contributes to Bitcoin's overall economic use, but at a significant reduction of Bitcoin's L1 network's decentralisation. If too many people do this, Bitcoin de facto hardforks away *all* its rules and becomes a fiat currency ruled by the miners.
* Receiving transactions with a local full node: this contributes to Bitcoin's overall economic use *and* Bitcoin's L1 network's decentralisation. For Bitcoin to maintain its protocol rules, a supermajority of economic payments must rely on their own full node to verify them. (In theory, a true SPV node would be sufficient so long as there were a lot of full nodes as well, but these don't exist and may be impractical.)

There is not necessarily any such thing as "Alice's keys". It could just as well be "key derived from a common private seed shared by Alice, Bob, and Dan, the particular derivation of which is identified for Alice", but this doesn't mean the signature itself indicates the transaction has anything to do with Alice. It could just as well be from Bob or Dan.

Note that these release notes contain *bad* advice. Miners *should not* change blockmaxsize to blockmaxweight at this time.
Using blockmaxweight prematurely may result in blocks larger than 1 MB being created when you later upgrade to 0.13.1, and the network today is not prepared for such larger blocks. Instead, continue to use blockmaxsize and reevaluate the network situation when 0.13.1 is released.
If compact blocks sufficiently improve p2p block relay such that centralised miner networks (like FIBRE and even Core's own "addnode" option) are no longer required, then it will become reasonable to possibly increase block sizes.

The bottleneck for the blockchain isn't storage, but syncing. Specifically, bandwidth and CPU time. It's likely with 1 MB blocks that bandwidth improvements will eventually outpace the requirements, but for CPU time we are only likely to see ~15% improvement each year. 300k blocks mean ~15% blockchain growth per year.

Yes, using a light client with your own node is perfectly safe and gains the full benefits of running the node, *as long as you're connecting over Tor*... if you're not connecting over Tor, you get most of the benefits still, but at the risk of a MITM attack.

Most "paper wallets" are only a single ECDSA key, which is not sufficient for a wallet in itself. You'd need hundreds of them, and somehow keep track of which ones are for what, without losing ones that might be used again.

It could be a hardfork, but might as well be a softfork.
You'd want two changes:
1. A new script type that allows you to commit to a future spend before revealing the spending script (this is to safely spend EC-based funds).
2. A new script type that supports using QC-safe crypto for keys (for future funds).
The first is merely a specialisation of covenants, which can be implemented as a Script upgrade; and the second merely a normal upgrade to Script. Script upgrades have been done before with softforks many times (p2sh, cltv, csv), and segwit will make them even easier.

Every node does that for themselves. If the recipient doesn't check it, everyone else doing it is for naught. It's also not necessarily before miners add it to a block: if miners skip the checks themselves, they make an invalid block.

Hosted mining is nearly always *inherently* a conflict of interest. Miners are supposed to keep the network secure by being decentralised, but hosted mining is a centralisation force.

Reminder: With centralised mining, 6 blocks is *not enough* to consider transactions confirmed, even with a full node. (Light wallets should probably be waiting at least 30 blocks.)

Responding to pings also does not prove a working node, much less that the node is being used.
@_date: 2016-04-01 00:26:31
Depends. In the case of a simple uncontroversial upgrade, the ideal is for old nodes to gracefully degrade and otherwise continue to function, rather than break (which can leave nodes insecure, although a well-designed hardfork can prevent this). But when it comes to *wallets*, I don't think there is any scenario where breaking them irrecoverably like this is a sane choice.
@_date: 2016-04-30 06:39:57
Trezor doesn't support Bitcoin Core yet (and the wallets it does support don't meet my "sanity" criteria), so I don't see that I can reasonably recommend it.

Laptop without a wifi card running Bitcoin Core. Ideally, use the raw transaction APIs so you never need to connect it to the internet, but failing that, it is acceptable to connect it only for syncing.

Witness data is just another part of the transaction. As such, it's included in the block. However, clients are always free to choose how they want to transmit it (the p2p spec in BIP 144 just sends the entire block).
SegWit removes the block size limit entirely, and replaces it with new resource limits. Under the new limit, witness data costs 1/4th as much as the current transaction data, which results in block sizes up to 4 MB being possible (but 2 MB is more likely typical).
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:14:07

@_date: 2016-04-03 04:43:35
Everything can be pruned. SegWit allows pruning signatures *earlier*, but that's not a big deal IMO. AFAIK it's 1/4th so that the typical use block size limit works out to be about 2 MB. IMO it should probably be at least 3/4, but it's not something I consider worth arguing over.
@_date: 2016-04-23 06:43:37
If miners, or even a majority of the ecosystem, decide to remove protocol rules (ie, hardfork), everyone who does not adopt the changes will ignore their forked chain entirely, as if it didn't exist. This is necessary to Bitcoin's design so that each person has autonomous control of their own money, and the rules can't be changed out from under them. So in a scenario such as this, you would end up with two independent cryptocurrencies, the original Bitcoin, and the forked chain. So long as the original Bitcoin exists, it clearly has well-established usage of the name "Bitcoin", so the new chain must select a new name or it its users would be essentially committing fraud by misrepresenting their new altcoin as "Bitcoin".
For a situation where Bitcoin *itself* hardforks, the previous chain must cease being used. The only way this is true, is if literally everyone using Bitcoin decides to switch to the new rules. A super-majority of maybe 95+% of the economy (not miners) *might* be able to coerce the remaining 5% to switch, but it is very uncertain at what point this would be successful, and in some cases may be ethically dubious since it is literally forcing that 5% to devalue their money. Note that significant uncertainty of success is generally considered an unacceptable gamble for a currency of Bitcoin's market-cap. Because of these (and other) reasons, it would be very irresponsible to try to proceed with any hardfork until reasonable certainty can be established that there is no significant objection (from even a minority of the economy) to the *exact* changes in the proposal.
Furthermore, even without a significant objection from the community, it is uncertain if there may be a significant part of the economy *entirely ignorant* of the proposal (a *lot* of Bitcoin users, surprisingly enough, seem to be unaware of the entire blocksize discussion!). So a hardfork also needs to consider these users, and any attempt should be done in a way that doesn't put them at jeopardy of *accidentally* forking - which is what will happen if someone fails to change to the new rules even out of ignorance.
So applying this to the hardfork that I and some other devs agreed to propose, the current [tentative] plan for the proposal as I see it is:
1. We must determine what changes are likely to gain consensus with the community. (Although the proposal is contractually required to handle ~2 MB of current pre-segwit transactions, whether or not we believe the community will accept this change.)
2. The code needs good review and documentation, on all its effects, so the community can make an informed decision.
3. A soft hardfork process will be used so that old nodes are not compromised.
4. Users must indicate through some to-be-determine mechanism that they agree to the changes.
5. Miners must gauge user consensus, and signal readiness with a configuration option *only* when they see the entire economy has consented.
6. When this readiness is signalled, nodes of users who have consented to the changes will switch to the new rules. If there are users who have objected to the changes, *their own nodes only* will automatically switch PoW algorithm (note this condition would never trigger so long as miners stick to the plan, but is necessary to prevent someone from forcing miners to signal before the network has consented).

Ideally, you would run it on a usually-offline laptop. None of the dedicated hardware wallets have bothered to support it yet, unfortunately.


The RPC interface can be used for a fully offline wallet using Core. You'd setup an online system with a watch-only copy, and use fundrawtransaction there to create transactions which you then sign (with signrawtransaction) on the offline PC. This is a bit complicated for novices, however.

Just download the newest version and install it. Note that you should not simply blindly upgrade, however: evaluate the changes and decide for yourself if you would like to accept the new rules.

Addresses are an opaque abstraction. They are implemented using scripts that can be satisfied only by a certain private key. The script is not the address, however. Often, that private key may also be the same for many different addresses. And most critically: while the address indicates a specific user, the keys do *not* represent users. So it is quite possible the UTXO was created when sending to Joe, but spent when Fred is the sender.
@_date: 2016-04-29 21:48:27
It creates UTXOs that do not represent value.
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:48:00
If there is a real hardfork, then nothing special happens. But such a hardfork requires consent from the entire community, which isn't what happened in Ethereum (only 5% of the community consented to it).
Without consent, an attempted hardfork just becomes a separate coin with initial balances equal to the original coin. In that case, your bitcoins would be unaffected, but you would have an equal amount of forkcoins on a new forkchain. One facet, however, is that any action on either the bitcoins or forkcoins could initially be replayed so the same action occurred on the other blockchain as well. However, just because a transaction to you confirms on one, does not mean it will confirm on the other, and so the two chains will gradually diverge.

With nearly 1 MB blocks, the peer-to-peer relay network has been unable to keep up with getting blocks from Miner X to Miner Y in a timely manner. This would normally reduce network security significantly (attackers are unaffected by the latency). However, it can be (and presently is) "solved" by having a centralised block relay network - but that centralised network can censor participants as it likes. Unfortunately, the existence and necessity of this network means that using the peer-to-peer network for block relay impacts not only network security, but also miner profitability - so miners effectively *must* comply with the rules of the relay network (where censorship can be enforced), or else they take a non-trivial hit in income.
@_date: 2016-04-29 23:02:41
No, but blocks larger than ~400k do. Bitcoin is *presently not* censorship-resistant. (0.13 should improve on this threshold, if Matt's relay improvements get merged.)

Great, [I proposed that in 2013]( But a more important issue today is that people want to reuse addresses. As-is, your proposal fails to support that. I suggest starting with BIP 47, making it sane (remove its required address reuse), and combining it with BIP 124 and your suggestions.


There's libbase58. Why didn't you use that?


This seems unavoidable. (Your own proposal in particular is also variable-length.)

Yes and no. There are improvements that could be made to the p2p protocol, some of which will hopefully make 0.13 (but note they don't help until most of the network, not merely miners, adopt them).  But part of it is also the reduced latency of only going 2 hops instead of N (grows as the network gets larger), which is inherently centralised.

The seeds merely act as a failover. You connect to one of the peers, and then you can use the normal p2p network to find more. Normally, you don't even need the seeds, since Core remembers IPs from the last time you ran it.
The operators of the DNS seeds used by Core are all specified in the source code comments.

To be safe, I suggest you make a new wallet in Bitcoin Core, and send all your funds to it ASAP. You do not need to wait for it to sync before you send, but it won't show up there and you won't be able to send it again until the sync finishes - that will require approx 80 GB of download (during which time, additional bandwidth will be used for the p2p network). If you can't run Core for some reason, Electrum is *probably* safe for this purpose.

That doesn't contradict what I said. And segwit is the only softfork block size increase possible.
@_date: 2016-04-02 07:40:21
The block size should be lowered, not raised. Actual transaction volume right now is approx 420k/block, and an unsolved problem with Bitcoin is that IBD time grows forever (even after accounting for tech improvements) at any size over 300k/block.
The block size *limit* can be raised independently from this fact, to allow some peace of mind should Bitcoin experience a sudden adoption surge, and work is under way to do just that. But Bitcoin is intentionally designed such that changes to the rules like this are impossible without consensus from all (or at least close to it) Bitcoin users. This was/is necessary for it to maintain its governance-resistant properties and provide true ownership over ones own bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-04-23 04:03:13

Well, the high level idea is oversimplified and poorly phrased in such a way that it enables the FUD. Would it not be equivalently high-level and much clearer to simply say the witness data is skipped when computing the transaction id?
As for the latter part, backward compatibility is maintained by not giving old nodes the full block, and thus those nodes' enforcement of their "block size limit rule" is defective. SegWit can then take advantage of this degraded check to increase the block size, provided it enforces new limits that are carefully designed to avoid old nodes believing the "block size" (as they see it) is too big. (In this case, the new limit is on the UTXO set modifications.)
@_date: 2016-04-09 03:12:48

1. The HK agreement did not specify any exact dates, merely that the hardfork would be ready within 3 months after SegWit.
2. SegWit's original estimated readiness was sometime *in* April, not *before* April.
3. This estimate is merely an estimate, and not promised in any form.
4. Those of us party to the HK agreement have discussed trying to have something ready in July even if SegWit's release slips a bit.
All that said, 0.x.0 releases on principle never include softforks, so 0.12.0 does not include SegWit.


My crawler keeps an updated count at

Those quotes are all from the page.


I don't appreciate having to help you read what is quite clear right there on the page... not sure how that relates to sentiments.


I don't think it's quite fair to classify me as a "big blocker", since I think the block size needs to be reduced, and am willing to see the limit increased only as a compromise.


My guess is that I was not listed because I am sometimes considered affiliated with Blockstream, despite remaining independent. It certainly doesn't seem like Greg was trying to give an exhaustive list there, just name a few examples of entirely-unrelated-to-Blockstream devs. That quote sounds like it was in response to some anti-Blockstream FUD, more than related to hardforks.

Importing seeds isn't necessarily something you want to do on a regular basis. For the actual scanning, you can build a bloom filter to optimise the matching. And in theory, wallets could stop watching for an address once they find a single transaction to it, since addresses are supposed to be single-use, but I don't know of any that do that yet.

Old wallets cannot receive segwit UTXOs, but they can receive from new wallets that have them.
Sending to segwit from an old wallet is fine (assuming the new wallet uses the current address formats instead of something new that hasn't been invented yet).
@_date: 2016-04-03 03:02:29
P2SH (addresses that begin with '3') was designed with new output types in mind, so it can support segwit outputs. Every reasonable wallet supports P2SH addresses by now.
@_date: 2016-04-30 10:29:02
Spamming is any unsolicited/misuse of Bitcoin network resources. In this case, the non-spam filter is looking at the age of the inputs. If the UTXOs being spent haven't been touched in several weeks, it's *usually* a fair bet that it can't be spam.

It's only a matter of time before Lightning is completed, and I'm pretty sure there is at least one working-despite-being-incomplete implementation right now.

Lack of any centralised entities.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:02:50
No, Lightning is actually more centralisation-resistant than Bitcoin today. To try to act as a centralised hub, you would need 200% reserves, and you would have relatively high on-chain costs since your channels would constantly get unbalanced. On top of that, users would need to willingly enable you to become or remain such a centralised hub by choosing to peer with you and nobody else, which would fall apart quickly if you tried to do anything stupid.
@_date: 2016-04-29 05:42:31

There is no meaningful distinction. Your current Bitcoin transactions don't produce a blockchain either. Lightning is no different.

Voluntarily stopping their machines is no better than mining honestly. Regardless of what they did, they *could* have double-spent there. That *possibility* is the problem of centralisation, not the actual fact of what they chose to do.
@_date: 2016-04-01 20:51:59
Such a scenario would likely be when there are no double-spends in the reorg. Bitcoin is intentionally designed such that malice is required for fraud, and when malice is absent, fraud doesn't accidentally occur.

They're not in the protocol, just Core.


New users might have a harder time getting online. They'd need to find another Bitcoin user manually and tell their node his IP.


Seeds aren't nodes, they're special DNS servers that give you a list of normal nodes. Typically the list of normal nodes is chosen by crawling the network and monitoring which nodes have the best uptime.


They're just DNS servers. Usually your ISP caches the results, so they never even get the direct query.

It's not separated, just rearranged. The point of putting it all together, is to skip it when calculating the transaction id (which fixes malleability).
@_date: 2016-04-18 21:40:48
Bitcoin transactions do not come from addresses at all, nor are there sums in the protocol, only distinct coins (UTXOs). It isn't possible to send only part of a UTXO's value, because doing so would either allow for replay attacks, unnecessarily complicate the protocol, etc. Furthermore, change is not a problem, and helps improve privacy.
Blocks are found randomly, not based on a sum of work. Every second, a typical USB miner will make 30000000000 *independent* attempts to find the block. More attempts per second increases your chances to find it first, but it doesn't eliminate the chances others have to find it.

That thread is nonsense. SegWit doesn't reduce/save space, but it doesn't make it worse either.
In any case, while SegWit only increases the block size, Schnorr signatures and Lightning are still coming and will improve on *actual* scalability.
@_date: 2016-04-18 01:43:32
Getting closer...
Signatures are still part of the transaction as always; they're just skipped when calculating the txid (which is how it fixes malleability).
Because old nodes don't support this new txid, the block uses two "mappings" for transactions in it, one using the txid, and the other using the hash of the full transaction. Old nodes only see the txid mapping, while new nodes see the new mapping. Because the old nodes think the txid is a hash of the transaction, they can't be told the signatures, so they calculate it correctly. But this also means they're not counting the signatures toward the old block size limit. The new UTXO modification limits are specifically designed such that old nodes will never overflow their block size limit with the stripped transactions, while new nodes which see the full block enforce only the new limits (and don't need to limit the block size at all, except to 4 MB as an optimisation only).

He intended for all businesses to run a full node *and* mine, and individuals to run SPV nodes.
But as reality has it, SPV doesn't work, and most businesses don't care to run their own node or mine. We can't really fix SPV in a meaningful\* way, which leaves us with a system where you need a full node to actually use Bitcoin. I don't know a good solution for businesses outsourcing their node - maybe we just need to encourage a lot of diverse service providers for them somehow?
\* Technically, it may be possible to make a near-SPV work to a limited extent, but only if these near-SPV nodes are *capable* of being full nodes.

Well, phones are all inherently problematic because of the insecure environment. Apps autoupdate by default, and you literally can't stop Google/Microsoft/Apple from getting in via backdoors. But I guess you're asking about user experience more than security...
The main problem is that it shows an address with no obvious purpose, and I literally couldn't figure out how to make an address for a specific receiving. Even when I received a payment, I couldn't figure out how to label it post-facto, much less label it before receiving. The transaction details also shows a bogus "input address".
It also created a new wallet without making *any* effort to get the user to back it up. Admittedly, Core also has this problem, and Mycelium did a little better by alerting to backup as soon as it received bitcoins.
There were also some technical glitches (it still shows a balance even after I emptied it, and says it's "Sending 0.0000518 BTC" even though it just sent nearly 11 BTC.

@_date: 2016-04-01 05:00:45


It's not optimism. The theory is sound. All that is missing is implementation, and it is known certain to be possible. There is no uncertainty to be optimistic or pessimistic about.


No, Lightning *needs* a blockchain - the same one we're using directly now. It's merely implementing a write cache with Bitcoin's built-in scripting.


The current bottleneck is bandwidth, not storage (by far). Throwing away the old blocks doesn't help bandwidth at all, besides the Initial Blockchain Download (IBD). However, to address the IBD issue, we'd literally need a 300k block size limit - and nobody is seriously suggesting that right now, we're just *assuming* that problem will get solved some other way.


Not sure why you think this. It isn't especially complicated (maybe they're aiming for a more-complex-than-needed-but-better protocol?). Absolute worst-case scenario, we could steal a centralised-directory system from Tor, which already does similar routing. (Note this wouldn't make Lightning itself centralised, since anyone could run a central directory.)

That implies miners have a vote on hardforks, or are relevant to them in some significant sense, which I have already debunked. 75% of miners is less than 1% of the network, far less than consensus.

Well, I think he still wants [at least a minority of] Core to propose a hardfork in a few months.
@_date: 2016-04-15 00:15:24
It also would mean hardforks can be deployed as a sidechain, entirely opt-in. When everyone has switched, the old chain is simply deleted. Basically the whole difficulty in coming to consensus for a hardfork could have been avoided, if we had done sidechains first.

@_date: 2016-04-19 06:32:48
Nope, but we can trust miners not to actually make any bigger blocks until the network is ready. I hope.
If the community doesn't want to trust miners with that, then someone will need to organise an effort to add the block size limit back in before SegWit gets activated.
But SegWit is our only opportunity to get rid of the limit without a hardfork. If we add the limit back in for SegWit, the only way to increase it later will be to wait until there is consensus for a hardfork.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:22:26
Fees are caused by spam, not block sizes. And no, it's FUD to say LN needs a block size increase.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:30:13
It's pretty simple math.
Historical improvement to the speed of processing the blockchain amounts to about 17% per year. 300k is about 17% of 100 GB. So to avoid increasing sync time, assuming future improvements match past trends, we need the average block size to be around 300k.

1 MB is *NOT* fine. It is demonstrably too large, as clearly shown by the many people who don't use full nodes of their own because of the long sync time.
To actually get a safe size, we'd need to reduce it down to 300k or so.

So long as this is true, Bitcoin can never achieve mass adoption. It only works if most users are using their own full node, period. Saying it "will never happen" doesn't change this fact.


Then they should use centralised currencies, which are inherently far cheaper and faster.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:31:54




When/if we reach that 200% growth, that means the time/cost to start a new node will increase by 156% after accounting for the expected 17% improvement in technology. That's over 2 times as long, and already people consider it to be too long!


Coin.dance doesn't measure actual node count, and what is important isn't node count, but node *percentage*. It's not clear if we're increasing on that metric.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:54:48
Your node is already up to date. Keeping up-to-date is not the issue. Starting a new node and syncing from 2009 is.

You're missing that Ethereum is highly centralised and its apps are not simply distributed, but rather *replicated*.

The security model of Bitcoin (or any decentralised currency) necessarily implies that most economic activity must have the receivers using full nodes of their own. If more than half the economic activity is insecure (which is what you get without a full node of your own), then the network as a whole is insecure as a result.
The fact that your own full node is required to be secure receiving bitcoins is a pretty big incentive...

It only seems weird to the current generation. Why hold back future generations just for that reason? The higher-order digits are inverted forms of the lower-order digits, so 9 is the flipped 6. 10-6=9, 10-9=6.

Implementing Segwit won't significantly reduce fees. But it will harm Bitcoin by enabling larger blocks. So personally, I much prefer if they *don't* implement Segwit.

The "congestion" is simply legit users paying a fee lower than spammers. Outbid the spammers, and things will just work. With p2pkh and even p2wpkh, that can get expensive, but Lightning should alleviate the cost significantly.
My comments were mostly regarding the decentralisation standpoint, which is far more crucial.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:45:13

People who aren't using their own full node have not adopted Bitcoin in the first place. They've merely switched from one trusted system to another one, and their new trusted system poses a systemic threat to Bitcoin.

Segwit has been active since last year, and has been over 80% of full nodes since before then. Nowadays, it's over 98% of full nodes.
No special effort is needed for the remaining 2%. Far more important to get people not running full nodes yet, to start using their own.
As far as usage... Segwit does not reduce fees, and should ONLY be used when upgrading to Lightning.

It's basically trivial for governments (or ISPs, if not prevented by government) to block Bitcoin.

The problem is that manufacturers have moved to hoarding and self-mining themselves, so you can no longer acquire ASICs without buying the centralised competitors even more. For every 1 Gh/s you buy, the manufacturer can buy 10 Gh/s more themselves for self-mining - so you end up making the problem *worse*. :/

That's fine. The time you need a full node is when you receive. Without a node, you can never be sure you have any bitcoins for real.
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:08:59
Bitnodes doesn't count all the nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:52:14
What is needed specifically, is that for a majority of the economic activity, the receiver of the payment is using a full node he runs himself. And we need to maintain this majority going forward.
Currrently, the only realistic approach to get to that point, is to reduce the block size limit.
Block size increases aren't scaling solutions anyway - they're avoidance of them. Scaling means using less resources for the same activity.

The Bitcoin protocol has no concept of people either. To send to a person, you use the abstraction of an address that person provides you. So the recipient must set down the terms of the UTXO before you can claim to have sent it to him.

Correct. It is presently impractical to achieve the standard of compatibility requires for consensus systems, except for using the exact same source code on all nodes. That's part of why this particular code is being isolated and moved to a dedicated library: so that it can be treated less as a private project, and more as the consensus protocol definition that it really is.

Have you tried the Bitcoin Wiki? That's where I tend to put explanations.


Generally, and especially in the context you seemed to be using it (notably the word "investor"), investments imply money has been put forward *toward* something, entitling the investor to some influence or authority to direct those he is paying. Buying bitcoins doesn't put money toward improving Bitcoin, it's merely a currency exchange and doesn't come with any entitlements whatsoever.


In this case, someone who merely buys bitcoins is not putting anything into "financial schemes, shares, or property" nor is "using it to develop a commercial venture". Bitcoin is not any of those, it is merely currency.


I mean my goal is to work on improving Bitcoin, with no concern given to how many people buy it or what the desires of people who hold it are. (Not including people who pay me to work on their specific interests, which is a real investment.)
@_date: 2015-12-02 09:53:42
Well, they're not *all* made in China. There is KnCMiner and 21Inc. China is actually the least evil in this regard (since they actually are willing to sell to people at barely-unprofitable prices).
The "fee market" isn't really a big focus, but has been thrown into the limelight by big-block hardfork movements. Probably if not for that, it'd be on the backburner until it was an actual problem.
Note that an ASIC-resistant system, even if possible, would be much worse than ASIC-friendly algorithms. Changing to a new ASIC-friendly algorithm over and over (this will take months between each change) until we have Bitcoin-friendly manufacturers who will sell at near-cost (they should get *some* profit to be fair) should be a reasonable solution - but first the community needs to be ready to insist on it. As a hardfork, it needs essentially 100% support from the economy, or at least everyone but the manufacturer-miners.
@_date: 2018-09-20 01:46:41
Then you don't understand/appreciate how crucial it is to use your own full node. Sure, the network suffers slightly, but you also have zero security yourself.

@_date: 2015-12-10 11:02:49
No, for security reasons also. Even without quantum computers, there are security risks to address reuse. Addresses have been single-use ever since they were originally introduced in Bitcoin; your "early wallets" (which weren't all that early) were a result of newbie third-parties not understanding how Bitcoin addresses work.
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:23:03


Validity is determined by the set of consensus rules in the protocol. For example:
* Transactions may not spend more than they have as inputs.
* The generation transaction may not claim more than 25 BTC + fees.
* Blocks may not be larger than 1 MB total.
* Inputs to transactions must not already be spent.
* Inputs to transactions must have been created previously within the same blockchain.
* Two transactions may not spend the same inputs.
* etc
Length only matters *after* all these criteria have been met. Hard forks propose to *change* the criteria for what is a valid block, which is why length is irrelevant to them. And if less than a supermajority of the economy is enforcing the consensus rules, they effectively do not exist at all, and there is no reason for miners to hold back on inflation or violating any others of them.

If you know who they are, you can sue. But the security needed to protect your bitcoins held by a website simply *doesn't exist*, so it's still a risk (that the company will go bankrupt) regardless.


The wallet.dat file *is your private key*. And it can't just be copied out of the directory either, you *must* make a copy with the Backup Wallet option in the program.


Addresses are basically invoice ids. You use them for a single payment, once. Wallets generate you a new one every time you want to receive. Note that *in no circumstance is Bitcoin ever anonymous*, however.
@_date: 2015-12-19 05:14:54
Nothing is certain until the release is published.
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:48:11
Finding the pubkey remains impossible for addresses both before 2012 and today.
The problem is with the wallets, not the addresses: as soon as you go to spend, you reveal the public key, and any quantum relay node can go ahead and double-spend you.
@_date: 2015-12-01 08:44:32
Well, obviously you could do the above with multisig or Lightning-like transactions, but this requires an additional step on the blockchain - it isn't something that can just automatically work in any of the use cases RBF is meant to solve.
Simply including a UTXO from the receiver won't help, since virtually every replacement transaction needs to change inputs somewhat anyway, so you can't lock them to the same set of inputs reasonably.
@_date: 2015-12-11 02:15:15
Well, it may be possible to get the behaviour you describe, but so far all soft-forks have invalidated old miners unconditionally, and I doubt SW is likely to change that.
Hard-forks leave old full nodes completely non-functioning and insecure. The benefit of a soft-fork is that it only reduces old full nodes to SPV security, and they continue to work fine otherwise.

Sadly, a *real world problem* is that nodes don't actually customise their policies, and at times this has been attributed to risk of breaking consensus with the network. So the result of making consensus possible to break from configuration, is people will shy away *even more* from making configuration changes. And the benefits of having such an option are literally zero, so...

@_date: 2015-12-27 14:58:37
1. 75% is a supermajority, not a consensus.
2. 75% of miners is ~0% of the economy (which makes the decision).
3. 90% is not demanding change - more like 5% at most from what I can tell. (to be fair, it may be a higher % when weighed by economic influence, but certainly still not a consensus)
4. 51% is only a mere majority, also not consensus.

May I share it privately with other developers at least?
@_date: 2015-12-14 00:29:03


This isn't really true. Once upon a time, before blocks were sorted at all, *arrival order* was relevant, but that hasn't been the case in a long time. The only metric used for priority is age and value of the inputs.
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:24:36
One thing I've suggested before for such a case, is a "miner vote" where miners are explicitly expected to turn it on via a config option (contrast with always-on-and-can't-be-disabled-without-downgrading), and do so only when they observe economic adoption of the change.
@_date: 2015-12-10 09:19:06

Sounds like the perfect use case for centralised off-chain payment systems like Coinbase and PayPal.
@_date: 2015-12-14 23:07:14
There is no consensus-compatible "seen order" - every node sees transactions in a different way. So consensus rules cannot be made based on "seen order", since there is no consensus as to that input.
FSS-RBF is restrictive because you must add an input, rather than simply reducing your change output.
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:05:02
Mining isn't what matters for hardforks. Merchant acceptance is.. and guess what Coinbase's nodes are used for.
@_date: 2015-12-10 11:00:46
It's a softfork. But ideally, we would want to also provide some resilient/safe upgrade path for old wallets, and that might need a hardfork. But it doesn't matter too much, since nobody in their right mind is going to oppose a hardfork to fix a completely broken Bitcoin... so economic consensus should be a very quick thing. ;)

Chips (of any kind) always have some failure rate. In any multi-chip device, that means you'd be near guaranteed to be shipping defective products if you didn't do burn-in testing. (That being said, there is definitely *better* burn-in testing than real-world mining... like feeding the chips *past* blocks to be sure they find them all.)

But miners/hashpower are basically irrelevant to hardforks.

This makes sense somewhat, but we don't necessarily know all those things, and hardforks can't be done overnight in any case.

That's why policy is human-defined and not a consensus rule. Miners (and to a less important extent, nodes too) need to keep on top of their policy to avoid mining spam at the expense of legit txs. For example, during Monday's spamfest, while most miners were producing blocks 90% full of spam, wizkid057 (Eligius) was keeping on top of it and producing large blocks *without* spam to clear the backlogs.

Anything that not 100% of full nodes have agreed/consented to store. So anything that isn't intended as a financial transfer between two parties, or abuses node resources outside of their designed use. A common example of the first is SatoshiDice, which uses transactions as messages to indicate interactions between gamblers and games. An example of the second is things like ASCII Bernanke, where text is disguised as ECDSA key hashes and does permanent/irreversible damage to the UTXO database.
@_date: 2015-06-05 04:34:10
There were signs of technical difficulties, but there were *not* publicly known signs of any financial losses - only a constant stream of FUD from people who didn't indicate they had any clue what they were talking about. MtGox was, at the time, in the best position to keep bitcoins secure, and even to date no other* company holding bitcoins has really come close to the theoretical level of competency MtGox *should have had* from public information. The lesson learned is never to trust someone else to secure bitcoins for you online, because *nobody* is competent to do it.
\* Except maybe BitPay, but AFAIK they don't hold bitcoins (but I don't know their merchant side).

Based on manually analysing your transaction, it would ordinarily take 123 more blocks (from now; about 21 hours) before becoming eligible for priority (no-fee) relaying and acceptance (under default relay/mining policies). I have prioritised your transaction on Eligius, so if we get lucky it may be mined sooner.
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:01:12
Depends on their wallet software. Bitcoin itself has no restriction.
@_date: 2015-12-14 04:09:08
I certainly plan to support it in Bitcoin LJR as much as I have time for, but it's much harder to maintain things separately from Core right now due to git's typical use model (which pushes people toward centralised projects).

* Week of Jan 17 at 500k
* Week of Jan 24 at 600k

That's transaction volume, not fees... :p
There's no doubt more spam now, but I'd need to figure out how to update the code to identify it accurately, and I don't see the benefits outweighing that cost.
In terms of future expectations, I think for the most part, with Bitcoin's current state (barely usable and unfriendly wallets being the biggest barrier; merchants almost *need* to go through a payment processor; etc), most of everyone who would be willing to adopt it already has. So growth for the time being will probably be slower than it has been for the past few years. During the history of 6 years, we only got up to 1/3 of the block full, so with that in mind, I do expect at least another 6 years before we start bumping into the limit with no changes. Hopefully things *will* change (especially, better wallet software, although I don't see much effort in that area), but I would be [pleasantly] surprised to see a big adoption spike that pushes us to 1 MB any sooner than 1-2 years from now. Any such increase of adoption will hopefully bring an equivalent number of developers to help out, so we'll also have more resources to put into scaling at that point than we do now.

A hardfork would just have a set activation time after which the rules change. So the new software would work with both rule-sets and switch automatically at the right point. Then it's just a matter of everyone upgrading before that time.

Yes, this is why in practice it is really no less centralised than traditional client-server pools using the GBT protocol.
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:31:17
Basically agree, except that having "too few users" is *not* a centralisation issue; it is an adoption issue. Centralisation is measured by % of users that are running nodes and/or mining. So if there are only 10k users with 90% running nodes, we're less centralised than 10M users with 50% running nodes.

Lightning is an extension to Bitcoin that allows trustless unconfirmed transactions, which by extension means people can simply throw away transactions entirely in some cases (eg, when A pays B, B pays C, and C pays A), saving space on the blockchain and improving privacy.
Hardforks are essentially altcoins that are proposed to *replace* the current Bitcoin network, and typically maintain the balances of all existing Bitcoin wallets. Deployment is difficult, since every Bitcoin user needs to agree in advance to switch to the new blockchain. Whether they are beneficial or harmful depends on the specific changes being made.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:36:42


If miners have any plans to go beyond 1 MB blocks before the entire network can handle it, I will be forced to change my position on all such proposals from "neutral" to "strongly opposed, and may need to start/join an altcoin when/if it happens".

Great. The Bitcoin development community is planning ahead by implementing Lightning networks to actually *solve* scaling, rather than workaround it by simply increasing load beyond what we're capable of.

When it comes to the consensus protocol/rules, the economy (merchants and especially creators) have all the power. Miners can restrict things further, but the economy can always replace the miners if they try to do something bad. People may try to delegate that power, but you cannot delegate *responsibility* against the will of the recipient.
When it comes to policy, each node operator is the sole authority unto themselves. You decide what policies to use on your own nodes, period.

Softforks are decided by miners. Miners are the ones the block size limit needs to restrict. Why would a miner ever softfork it down?
@_date: 2015-12-07 06:28:22
Hmm, problem here is that CPU usage is not the primary bottleneck for block sizes: bandwidth is. And unfortunately, SW doesn't help in the bandwidth area at all. So while I do think we should take this opportunity to get the block size changes softforked in instead of hardforked (buying us a bit more time before a hardfork is required?), it does still need to be gradual and not just 4x at once.
My suggestion is to go based on either BIP 103 or John Sacco's double-the-limit-every-subsidy-halving idea.

@_date: 2015-06-10 02:14:32
You've got that backward. Increasing the block size prematurely can do permanent damage. Waiting until we *start* filling blocks has no risk.

Near the end of [the documentation for 0.10.x-ljr]( is a detailed description of my spamfilter patch. Besides this, I think wizkid057 has some further improvements; at the very least, he has been monitoring the situation today and tried to keep on top of it. Since other miners are just mining 90% spam, Eligius has increased its max block size to 1 MB to try to clear up as many non-spam transactions as possible.
@_date: 2015-06-04 02:56:07


No cherry-picking was done. Every single block found after 10 minutes +/- 10 seconds (according to the block timestamps) was included.


No, it isn't. Please learn how Bitcoin works. Many blocks are found only after several hours, and many are found in a matter of seconds.

1. Eligius doesn't make you wait the 120 blocks. That's completely up to your wallet.
2. Coinbase supports signing messages, so you can change the config fine with it.
3. Description of Eligius's reward system is completely wrong. The pool will pay for the most recent shares first.
4. Eligius's reward system never runs in the red.

It increases *while* it's in the mempool, for external reasons (more blocks being found), but the duration in the mempool isn't itself a factor to what the priority is.
How you phrased in in your OP edit is "close enough" IMO. (Technically, it gets recalculated every time the miner rebuilds their target-block in 0.11, but there's no need for that and it will be closer to how you describe in 0.12 if it doesn't get disabled entirely. Either way, it's just an irrelevant implementation detail.)

With current mining policies, it will eventually confirm as long as it isn't identified as spam (eg, dust amounts). But as of right now, there is a movement within Bitcoin Core to remove the "priority" logic so that no-fee transactions *never* get confirmed, and worse, to make it difficult for miners to restore this policy. I am in the minority that opposes this, but it seems like the other devs mostly have made up their mind and are going to just ignore me.

Not very quickly, no. It's around 350k right now after 6 years.


No, we'll most likely have several weeks of a functioning fee market before it becomes a problem. This is plenty of time to do an emergency hardfork if a better solution hasn't surfaced by then.


Can't, that whole section is read-only. Maybe I can suggest wizkid057 take it down - hopefully it's not needed for anything anymore.


I couldn't say I'm entirely unaffiliated, but Eligius has never provided any economic benefits to its operator(s). Even when transaction fees were retained by the pool, those fell far short of operating costs. The only economic benefit I get, is from *using* Eligius for mining.

[See this comment](


More like a false sense of security, really.


We're not approaching the 1 MB block size, and probably won't for another 2-5 years. There is at least one viable proposed alternative, the Lightning model, and it seems reasonable as an unrelated third-party (to Lightning) that it could be implemented before we get close to having issues with the 1 MB block limit. Sidechains do not attempt to address scaling at all.


There is no beta branch of Core in terms of hardforks, and in practical terms *cannot* be (this is the very problem sidechains are intended to address). An accepted change to the consensus rules would have to be deployed by every single Bitcoin node, without exception. Threats of forks are not a rational argument for making a change.


Unless bigblock-XT reaches 99.999...% adoption, it would become either a "premined" altcoin (if it sustains more miners than Bitcoin) or merely a buggy node implementation (if it fails to acquire miners) at the "hardfork" date.


This isn't really a technical question. I don't predict the future.


The Bitcoin whitepaper is not relevant to the direction of Bitcoin. We have no central authorities, so the decision making simply must follow its natural course given the design of the system. That effectively means merchants and exchanges people want to use have the decision on hardforks, and miners have the decisions on softforks. The only thing developers really have a part in, is writing code, giving informed advice/opinions, and deciding to jump ship if people make stupid decisions.


Why would this make sense? We founded Blockstream to improve Bitcoin, not to make a scamcoin. No amount of good will on the part of the developers of an altcoin can prevent scammers from taking advantage of it for pump and dump. Furthermore, even if we could make an altcoin somehow immune to the scamcoin effect, it would either still fall under the same decision-making nature as Bitcoin (presumably with the same results), or be centralised (which seems pointless).
@_date: 2015-06-14 03:56:59
You'd have to define Bitcoin for that. If you mean the current system without any hardforks, I agree USD will outlive it. If you mean the currency as changed by hardforks, then it's too broadly defined to seriously wager in favour of (eg, the 20 MB block stuff is a real existential threat to Bitcoin). But I can still *hope* for the latter! :)
Also, what currency would we wager in? If Bitcoin, then it's win-win for me (if you win the bet, those bitcoins are worthless); if USD, then it's lose-lose for me. ;)

A "small percent of the network" losing money due to critical bugs is a worse situation than "nobody on the network" losing money because the exact same code is used as-is.

If normal users' normal transactions are considered spam, there is a serious problem with the spam filter.
My point was only that **priority policy** guarantees transactions will eventually confirm. Spam transactions are excluded because miners are supposed to prevent those from ever confirming - so they *never enter into the picture* for priority. The discussion here is about priority.

1. They weren't Bible verses.
2. They weren't embedded by abusing transaction structures, but placed in a part of the block that simply *needs* to be there and unique, to act as a salt.
3. I needed to use something non-random there for testing the new (at the time) merged-mining code, and prayers seemed like the perfect size as well as basically good to include.
4. This part of the block is *immediately* prunable, unlike most spam.
5. Using non-random data here also actually makes the block (and therefore the blockchain) more compressable.
6. Eligius miners were able to (and some did) submit their own short strings to include this way.

It does both in theory. Unfortunately, the anti-spam part doesn't actually work in practice, as spammers have figured out ways to get financing for their spam.
Maintaining the same block reward value is not sufficient. Right now, a small State could easily overpower Bitcoin by spending only some of their defence budget on miners. To one day have a network secure against (external) States, the mining reward will need to increase substantially.

I am no expert on quantum computing, but I think it is a pretty fast operation to break ECDSA with a reasonable QC. There is hopefully time lag between few-qubit QC and sufficient-qubit QC...
But since the addresses are themselves secure (provided no reuse), it's okay if we cannot adapt right away.  We just need to stop spending when that QC goes online (so the relayed transactions cannot be compromised in the meantime), and a hardfork can provide a quantum-safe upgrade path (transactions spending ECDSA-secured UTXOs would need to be mined as a hash pre-commit before the actual signature script is revealed).

Sidechains can implement whatever rules they want. If they tried to "withdraw" more bitcoins than went in, however, the withdrawl would be rejected from the main blockchain. Personally I think the demurrage approach of having coins change numeric amount (rather than the value fluctuate) is more straightforward to users.

All the miners combined, are at most a tiny tiny *minority*. There is no known way to measure economic majority in a consensus-safe manner.
If BIP 101 specifically said miners shouldn't set the bits until they have personally observed economic consensus, had a plan for what happens if miners collude to lie, and the software implementing it had the bits unset by default and enabled by such a flag indicating the operator has observed the required consensus, then it would possibly be reasonable. But as it is, XT's implementation *forces* the bits to be set unconditionally.

BIP 100 is more like miners A, B, and C ignoring miner D who made a block bigger than 500k and thus producing a longer chain so that block gets lost. The difference is, by expressing this as a protocol rule, full nodes can *also* know to ignore miner D's bigger block, thus be immune to attacks based on it.

I don't know that it's impossible, but fixing it may very well piss off a lot of people, and be politically impractical... that is, we could hardfork every time mining starts to centralise, until manufacturers learn they can't just abuse their position without losing all their investment. OTOH, Bitfury's recent announcement and general cluefulness seems to suggest they might "get it" and try to solve the situation on their own - I think we ought to give them a chance to do that before acting too hastily.

Softforks are based on miner majority acceptance, which can be perfectly measured by the consensus system itself. Hardforks are necessarily by near-universal agreement by merchants, which is not possible to measure in this way. The only way to deploy them is by humans (the entire community) waiting until there are no more known disagreement, and then everyone deploying code with a switchover date prior to that date.

In that specific example where 5M nodes is 50% and 9k nodes is 90%, yes.

@_date: 2015-12-13 06:14:40
It does also improve security of all the transactions already in the blockchain by giving them one more block confirming them - they'll get to 6+ sooner than without it. Also, the alternative to these empty blocks is (necessarily) a *stale* block, which would not only fail to improve the current blockchain, but cast doubt on the most recent block.

@_date: 2015-12-14 00:42:37
Yes. What happens internally, is that when the node receives a transaction, it calculates the current priority (which is not a cheap operation) and caches that in its mempool. The function you linked takes that, and adds the calculated difference in priority that would result from the increased age *since then*. In other words, if it was received at block 444, this function sees that the node is now at block 448 and adds ((448 - 444) * TotalValue) to the cached priority to calculate the current priority cheaper than if it calculated the priority from scratch. **tl;dr: This just calculates the current priority in an efficient manner.**
There is actually a bug resulting from doing it this way (0.11 and earlier did not use this trick), in that transactions spending unconfirmed inputs do not get adjusted correctly. This is fixed by [PR  which could also use some support.

Transaction fees are nothing new. And they're *still* lower than most fiat payment processing fees (but that won't last forever).

And with Lightning coming within the next year, that security will soon be *instant*.

Unfortunately, other implementations of the consensus rules are likely to have subtle bugs that break consensus, and there is no real way to find these bugs yet.

What utility is Bitcoin if the blockchain is itself no more secure than off-chain? That's where 20 MB blocks today would probably get us (note: I'm not talking about just the max size here, but actual blocks being this large - which *is* a possibility nobody can stop if the max is raised).
*IF* Bitcoin volume needed to surpass the blockchain capacity (highly unlikely), centralised off-chain transactions for *low-value* things is a reasonable compromise to keep the blockchain useful for *high-value* transactions without making it useless. In the meantime, development on making Bitcoin scale through Lightning or other improvements would continue, and hopefully bring these low-value transactions back eventually.


I would expect sooner, but it depends on how much people are willing to invest in making Bitcoin scale. If it's just Blockstream, maybe it will take 3 years - but if other companies contribute, that time can be made much shorter.


There is no such thing as "zero conf". Unconfirmed transactions are *not* on the blockchain at all, and Lightning is a strict improvement over them. Every Lightning transaction is also an unconfirmed blockchain transaction that you can be *certain* will not be double-spent. That's how it's trustless and provides instant confirmation.


No, because Lightning will be just another part of Bitcoin.

Yes, it would - but:
* I don't know that a 100% loss to current miners is going to meet any *more* opposition than a 10% loss.
* Since the centralised mining is basically not involved in the economy, they have no say in the matter.


*Possibly*, but centralisation also reduces security, so maybe a net gain? Of course, the ideal circumstance would be to have some "good" manufacturer involved so new ASICs are widely distributed before the hardfork occurs.


There almost certainly would be - for years now there are already chips that do both SHA2 and scrypt.
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:43:58
I don't know anything about how it works. Since only full nodes can even begin to make a reasonable guess, I would have to assume it probably queries some centralised server(s). If it's actually reliable, then it may simply be over-estimating the fee - that should work fine; it's only when people try to use the lowest fee possible that they'll run into trouble.

In theory, nothing stops hardforking for confidential values in the main chain.


If they're developed. So yes, you could prototype Lightning on a sidechain.


Three options:
1. The functionary model, where cosigners mechanically verify the withdrawls.
2. The SPV model, where the main chain is effectively a light node.
3. The SNARK model, where the main chain is a light node and verifies a proof that a full node has checked the block obeys all the rules.


* Functionary model: The functionaries could all collude to do something with the sidechain coins.
* SPV model: The miners could all collude to do something with the sidechain coins.
* SNARK model: You're stuck unless there's a backdoor in the rules (maybe with a time lock).


Only there for Alpha. Future testnet sidechains may very well be SPV or SNARK based. Nothing stops anyone else from continuing to maintain and make federated sidechains either.

The evidence doesn't seem to support this assumption: [only 44% have updated to 0.10.1+, over two months later, despite security vulnerabilities in prior versions](


I'm looking forward to this as well, but keep in mind the consensus rules *must* be identical for the system to function - and with the current state of technology, that means they *must* be using the exact same code for consensus itself.


Consensus matters such as block size limits *cannot* differ from node to node without breaking the system.
@_date: 2015-06-12 00:01:25


This is precisely why I don't actually *oppose* the increase (although I still think it's a bad idea).


That's a bit large - maybe even disturbingly so. Why?


I don't think any dev (even Gavin) thinks the default soft limit should be increased.
I have been thinking about adding a simple option for miners to vary their max size by time-since-last-block. So for example, a miner might set -blockavgmaxsize=400000 to make blocks up to 100k for the first 2.5 minutes, then increase to 400k over the next 7.5 minutes, eventually hitting 1 MB when the previous block has been 25 minutes ago (and possibly further when/if there is consensus for a hardfork to the hard limit). This seems like a more scalable maximum - although I'm not certain it's strictly better than just setting a fixed limit since the latter provides more fee market incentives.

In BTCC's case, it is merely copies with no value. But when people run a full node themselves, it is *verifying* all the transactions on the network, making Bitcoin secure for them. Unless a supermajority of the economy runs full nodes for their own transaction acceptance, Bitcoin is basically completely insecure and can be controlled at will by a miner majority much like the Fed controls the USD. They could then print more than 21M BTC, etc.

Fees don't entitle you to others' resources - *especially* when those fees don't go to the people whose resources you are consuming.
Spam is anything *unsolicited*. Full nodes have solicited transactions moving bitcoins implicitly, because that's what the system was designed for, but any other use case lacks consent from all full nodes. It's actually quite similar to the need of hardforks to gain unanimous acceptance, except without any way to enforce it.

I would argue that the inefficient stuff *ought not* be in blocks, and that miners including them is the very same DoS risk that Satoshi added the block size limit to prevent in the first place. If the normal transactions were to be enough to fill blocks, then miners would need to choose between mining the inefficient ones for profit or mining some of the normal transactions; hopefully they would do the right thing and drop the less efficient transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:04:30

I don't expect to reach 1 MB any sooner than 2 years from now. In that time, I expect Lightning to become usable and the primary mechanism for exchange of bitcoins. That buys us decades until 1 MB is reached. By then, increasing the block size shouldn't cut anyone off from the system (as it does today).

The evidence would actually suggest a reduction is a good idea at least temporarily. But is it worth the effort to argue? That's not so likely to be true. Also note the decision-makers are different groups: while an increase is a hardfork and falls to merchants/exchanges, a decrease is a softfork and falls to miners.

[See this comment](


More like a false sense of security, really.


We're not approaching the 1 MB block size, and probably won't for another 2-5 years. There is at least one viable proposed alternative, the Lightning model, and it seems reasonable as an unrelated third-party (to Lightning) that it could be implemented before we get close to having issues with the 1 MB block limit. Sidechains do not attempt to address scaling at all.


There is no beta branch of Core in terms of hardforks, and in practical terms *cannot* be (this is the very problem sidechains are intended to address). An accepted change to the consensus rules would have to be deployed by every single Bitcoin node, without exception. Threats of forks are not a rational argument for making a change.


Unless bigblock-XT reaches 99.999...% adoption, it would become either a "premined" altcoin (if it sustains more miners than Bitcoin) or merely a buggy node implementation (if it fails to acquire miners) at the "hardfork" date.


This isn't really a technical question. I don't predict the future.


The Bitcoin whitepaper is not relevant to the direction of Bitcoin. We have no central authorities, so the decision making simply must follow its natural course given the design of the system. That effectively means merchants and exchanges people want to use have the decision on hardforks, and miners have the decisions on softforks. The only thing developers really have a part in, is writing code, giving informed advice/opinions, and deciding to jump ship if people make stupid decisions.


Why would this make sense? We founded Blockstream to improve Bitcoin, not to make a scamcoin. No amount of good will on the part of the developers of an altcoin can prevent scammers from taking advantage of it for pump and dump. Furthermore, even if we could make an altcoin somehow immune to the scamcoin effect, it would either still fall under the same decision-making nature as Bitcoin (presumably with the same results), or be centralised (which seems pointless).
@_date: 2015-06-06 23:17:47


To run a SPV node, you still need to request the blocks - the difference is that you're now asking the sender to spend *more* effort filtering them so you don't need to download it. In some cases, this may be more expensive to the sender than you just downloading the full block. So, a limited SPV mode is still needed since even SPV nodes may be expected to pay for their resources.

Developers have no particular say in the matter. It's exchanges and merchants that make the decision, and 100% of significant ones need to agree with it.
I don't think Mircea Popescu is significant. Maybe I'm wrong, in which case when/if everyone else is onboard, the community will need to discuss whether to give any heed to his un-reasoned objections.
Changing the number of bitcoins issued in any way other than further division would go against what has been socially considered an unchangeable constant, so in that scenario I think even if merchants/exchanges were all on-board with it, I think we'd have an ethical obligation to consider it an attack and resist it as much as possible unless every single node had agreed. The block size and many other technical changes are different because they were never "promised" to stay the same, and even expected to change down the road: so it's not unreasonable for exchanges/merchants to put economic pressure on the rest of the nodes.
P.S. I think it's a bad idea, but I'm not explicitly objecting to changing it myself.

Online games only do this by being closed source and tightly controlled in a dictatorship fashon - and even then it's possible to hack at them. Basically it works by making the client tell the server (or other clients) his own version, and the other end refusing to communicate with you if you report an older version. In other words, you can just lie to get the other side to accept your custom software.
Anyhow, this is inherently contradicting with Bitcoin's decentralised design.

Sorry, but I agree the F2Pool move was a net improvement over the status quo. Nobody ever had any guarantee for unconfirmed transactions, and can only blame themselves if they treat them as irreversible. But more importantly: miners have gone too long without making their own policy decisions and relying on centralised default policies; so F2Pool beginning to make these decisions is a huge improvement in the mining situation. It's quite unfortunate they were immediately attacked for doing so.
The latest in the RBF discussion after this, is to try to treat RBF, and therefore policy, as some kind of protocol rule that must be standardised in a BIP. This is a very dangerous direction, since it lays the grounds for holding miners liable for not using BIP-defined policies, and therefore government regulation of Bitcoin itself. If things continue down this path, I am inclined to strongly push for miners to deploy full RBF immediately just to prevent it - the damage to negligent merchants is frankly a non-issue in comparison.

@_date: 2015-06-10 10:07:06


In both cases, the sender must voluntarily set the fee they are willing to pay, and miners must decide based on that offering if they will include the transaction.


No, because if the price ever differed, you'd just transfer your bitcoins to the other blockchain to get the better price...

There was a separate "BDB lock limit" nobody knew about until miners starting trying to *actually make* blocks bigger than 500k, at which point nodes failing to enforce that limit got forked off the main blockchain. I didn't read through this whole thing to make sure it's a correct account of the incident, but it's a link that might be more or less helpful:

Full RBF is needed to *increase* the utility of Bitcoin. In particular, right now if you send a transaction with too low a fee, it will just get stuck for at least a few days - but potentially forever, especially if priority gets removed. FSS-RBF doesn't allow bumping the fee unless your wallet has additional UTXOs available, and both FSS-RBF and CPFP are expensive to bump fees. CPFP is particularly bad about it, but necessary for *recipients* to be able to take action. Only full RBF provides an efficient and always-available way for users to increase their fees on transactions that are taking longer than they would like to get mined.

Peter Todd is in fact a Bitcoin Core dev paid by Viacoin. Don't ask me why Viacoin pays for Bitcoin development, but it is what it is.


No, it's actually a pretty good idea.


No, only merchants who need the transaction to be irreversible need to wait for confirmation. This is *already* true today, even without RBF.


While centralised pools ought to make their policies known to miners using them in advance, miners in general have no obligation to make their policies public at all, certainly not in advance.


Incompetent payment providers should not be Bitcoin's fault.


This is not true. Treating unconfirmed transactions as if they are confirmed is *always* unsafe/risky. RBF does not make it significantly worse.
IMO, F2Pool should decide their own policy without coercion from anyone other than their own users/miners. One of Bitcoin's major problems today is that miners just run with default policies, and I find it a huge setback to have F2Pool attacked so relentlessly when they make their first step into taking responsibility for their own policies. I am, however, glad they decided to only downgrade to RBF-FSS rather than abandon policy customisation altogether.

As far as increasing the block size, it's not just some magic number that can be freely tweaked without real side effects (such as making Bitcoin unusably centralised). Nor is it my decision (nor any of the developers') to make.

Yes, I think so. Although it does also make sense to raise the block size by discounting the witness data only, to encourage people to use it appropriately - 75% may be a bit too much of a discount, though. (Note that no developer, including me, is opposed to any block size increase whatsoever.)

Couldn't a miner just use 80x 100k transactions for the same effect? You'd need to make sure all of the transactions are valid, but I'd think that you can still get more sigops in with the new 8 MB limit - probably approximately the equivalent of ~3 MB blocks without the new limit.

600 MB blocks requires nodes to have 1.3 Gbit upload minimum.


It *might* require blocks bigger than 1 MB to scale beyond *30 million people*.


The point of the block size limit is not to hold back transaction volume, but to prevent spam. It continues to prevent spam even with Lightning, so no, it doesn't become pointless.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:55:47
No, I mean 1 MB. We're not even anywhere near it yet, and already full node count has dropped by 95%. And when people are asked why they don't run a full node, the answer generally comes down to block size.

@_date: 2015-06-20 05:35:33
300-400 kB seems to be a better target right now. Going too far also damages Bitcoin by stifling real transactions. Note we don't need to adjust the hard limit to get smaller blocks: miners can (and should) be monitoring the appropriate level on an individual basis.
@_date: 2015-06-05 02:51:19
Because there isn't a central authority to enforce your payment to them, and the current state of decentralised consensus requires an hour to be almost-entirely secure.

They do. And even on smaller blocks, 10% of the transactions tend to be spam.
@_date: 2015-06-26 05:50:21


How about making Bitcoin work better? Strict RBF allows simply adjusting fees to incentivise confirmation if the first transaction was rejected. RBF-FSS requires adding more inputs, thus uses more data and needs higher fees.


How about to avoid merchants implementing bad security practices harmful to Bitcoin in the long term?

[I looked into transaction volume earlier this year]( and found that the current rate of growth is about 10k per month. That puts us at approx 400k/block now. Over the summer and fall, there was no big boom to Bitcoin adoption that would explain a change in this rate of growth; however, one thing *did* happen: spam attacks began to try to put pressure on increasing the block size prematurely.


Not all of them propose an immediate increase to 2 MB. I like Pieter's BIP 103, which seems to be modelled based on reality. Even Gavin's BIP 101 was justified on the basis that miners could be *trusted* not to make full blocks.


Not an immediate increase to 2 MB...


I don't think it's forbidden to talk about here. After all, nobody is complaining that you just did.

It isn't what Bitcoin was made for, and it does not have the consent of 100% of Bitcoin users (ie, full nodes).


Bitcoin does not provide secure proof of fairness. This is just a marketing gimmick at best, especially when you consider these "services" have provably defrauded a number of winning bets.


You're ignoring the full nodes, many of which DO NOT desire the transactions but are still forced to download and store them by the  malicious (in your example) miner.
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:42:33
Miners and devs have no direct voice in the matter. The only thing anyone can do to directly influence things in a hardfork, is become a person/entity who others want to pay with bitcoins.
Anyhow, before you try to promote a hardfork, you really ought to research it somewhat. And frankly, if you think it should be increased, you have *not* done this research and *you* are the idiot.

I'm not sure this is a useful goal. Penalty or not, the damage is still done. And when there's actually a need for larger blocks, we don't want to penalise. So... when would this make sense?
* If the blocks shouldn't be large, a penalty doesn't address the problem.
* If the blocks should be large, the miner shouldn't be penalised.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:18:23
Your reasoning is correct, except that we're nowhere near exhausting 1 MB. We already have plenty of time for Lightning *without* kicking the can down the road.
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:13:55
A hardfork without consensus is technically identical to an altcoin. So XT in the scenario laid out by bitcoin.org's policy would de facto be an altcoin with a large premine and trying to claim the name "Bitcoin" for itself. The reason past hardforks were not altcoins is because they had consensus.
@_date: 2015-06-12 01:47:23
A gradual increase seems more reasonable, but I'm not sure it makes sense to out-pace bandwidth (15%/yr) or start until either we *need* to, or we aren't sacrificing the network decentralisation by doing so.

What about when the person who controls that private key is not the person who owns the bitcoins?

@_date: 2015-06-08 19:04:24
It also gives *centralised* influence to mining policies, since the protocol hard-codes assumptions. If it could be reduced to *only* give nodes influence, then it would become viable.
It doesn't solve big blocks, however: it's merely an influence, and a miner can choose to ignore it.
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:54:37
Yeah, it's called testnet.
@_date: 2015-06-23 04:58:26
There is a slight increase in security, but a greater decrease because the honest miners are wasting more work with stale blocks (while the attacker has no such waste at all).
SPV nodes sync only block headers, and 2x more frequent blocks means 2x as many headers for the same time period.
@_date: 2015-06-19 04:02:27
Your client won't know it's confirmed until it syncs, but it will still send just fine.
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:47:59

@_date: 2015-12-12 08:45:21
Nodes and miners employ anti-spam algorithms to try to filter out garbage. To get past that, the attacker would need to spend money for fees, and hope people don't catch on to a new pattern and update their spam filters. Furthermore, legitimate users can just start paying higher fees to get around it, so it doesn't really deny service much.
These attacks are actually ongoing, and make up the majority of transactions these days.

Only ones paying no or low fees. Just including a minimum standard fee got transactions confirmed in the very next block. 8 hours isn't bad in any case.


Not for non-spam, which is kinda the point.


The blockchain isn't supposed to be realtime. At a minimum, a transaction takes an hour to get the full 6 block confirmation. It's perfectly reasonable for low-fee transactions to take a day to confirm, and one might even *expect* to see that in a healthy blockchain.

Did you pay a high fee? If not, you should only hope for it to confirm sometime in the next week (although in practice it's usually quicker). If so, then maybe you didn't put enough of a fee on it, or produced a transaction that miners are considering as spam.

Delays are expected for low priority transactions in a functioning fee market. If there is no progress made on Bitcoin in the next 2-5 years, we may start to see unacceptable delays at that point.


If it's done today, it can. Hopefully miners won't be so foolish as to do this, even if the limit is removed. Also note Satoshi did *not* suggest removing or increasing it at this stage where the spam problem is still unfixed and the current limit not a problem.
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:19:57
I think most (all?) of us are biased toward larger blocks, actually. That almost all of us think it's a bad idea *despite* our bias toward them, is pretty important to note.

That's oversimplified. All the caching is not stored to the blockchain, only the final outcome. You can have ~unlimited transactions that occur and never need to be recorded.

It was supposed to be removed when the spam problem was otherwise solved. Since it hasn't been solved (the situation now is worse than when the limit was added), it still serves the useful purpose of limiting the damage.

Yep, probably.


Not likely. After all, only the main chain has the subsidy, so sidechains rely on fees alone to incentivise miners.


No, but it might be worth it for whatever features the sidechains offer. It's certainly a better situation than altcoins.

You don't need broadband for 1 MB blocks - dialup can do acceptably. I'm certainly not a "deciding line" or deciding anything - I can only give my opinion and hope those making the decision (merchants and exchanges) yield an appropriate conclusion.


Yes, holding Bitcoins might give people (including myself) a conflict of interest along these lines. I try to avoid letting my biases influence my opinions in this area, however. This certainly wouldn't be the first time I've taken positions against my own interests.
@_date: 2015-06-13 19:53:52




People seem to already be worried enough about market acceptance outpacing what Bitcoin can handle. Seems to me we should focus on making Bitcoin *capable* of scaling, before trying to spend more effort on adoption. Sidechains may not help scaling directly, but it's an important tool for testing those improvements.

Bitcoin XT actually predates the block size matter entirely, and was forked by Mike Hearn (*not* a Core developer) to merge some relatively ill-advised things appropriately rejected from Core (because they don't/can't work): particularly, double spend relaying/detection.


To complicate matters a bit: if you send 1 BTC, you also send 1 BTCXT, and vice versa. Unless the bitcoins being redeemed (essentially chosen at random) happen to only exist on one or the other blockchain.

It *is* prunable, but before you can prune it, you must still first download it. Furthermore, almost every valid use case, can also be done privately with an ordinary transaction indistinguishable from any other payment. The only exception where I can see OP_RETURN may be an appropriate solution is Counterparty. But in reality, the graphs didn't change much when I added the code to count OP_RETURN anyway.

@_date: 2015-06-04 17:10:34
No, there isn't a way to do it without moving them. The sign-message functionality only proves you own an address to receive with,  it doesn't prove you still own any bitcoins that were previously sent to that address (nor does the un-spentness of the UTXO created in that transaction infer this). If someone trusts a signed message as "proof of possession", they are open to fraud.

The blockchain doesn't store data, it records transactions. If you have a JPG of pedo stuff, and a PNG of your coat-of-arms, and both of these coincidentally happen to be encoded using the same bit pattern, what is the difference between the two? Are both illegal? Generally, the difference is spoken of as the "colour" of the bits - what they are intended to represent. In the case of the blockchain, the data is all coloured as financial transfers. You could make software that transforms that data into an image (eg, by decompressing it as JPG), but then your software is manipulating the colour in doing so - the blockchain data itself isn't illegal.
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:18:20

Big difference between being able to mine, and being able to run a node (ie, *actually use* Bitcoin).
Besides, you weren't cut off from mining, you simply chose not to do it. Anyone can buy a GPU (or a FPGA, or an ASIC). Not everyone can get unmetered 43 Mbit upload bandwidth.

In effect, this would probably just be a miner discount on transaction fees - but we actually sortof already have that: only full nodes can reliably guess the fees they need, while "SPV" nodes are left having to over-estimate based on insufficient information...

It means "not centralised". The only reason people are "stuck" on consensus with the block size matter, is because there *really is* no reason to make the change.

If that's the only change, no. But progression of development can make it easier, hopefully counteracting the additional cost of more nodes. Sidechains in particular will allow testing out hardforks before deploying them to the production network.


A hardfork necessarily "fires" every miner, merchant, and user, and "re-hires" at least the merchants (without whom, there is no economy). If miners choose not to be "re-hired" (or if the hardfork doesn't make them "re-hirable" such as a change in PoW algo), that has no relevant effect on the hardfork.

It will render fiat banking websites insecure *at the same time* as Bitcoin... and then the central entity monitoring the fiat banking websites will just turn them off until they are fixed, and reverse any fraudulent transfers.

Not worth forking over. Just ask miners to make smaller blocks. Anything below 300k right now is IMO absurd, though.
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:30:52


Not quite. If you ignore consensus rules, you are no longer a functioning full node, and are vulnerable to many of the same attacks SPV nodes are at risk for. Furthermore, if you continue to relay transactions and blocks in this state, you will be banned by real full nodes if you ever encounter them, and thereby isolated - so you won't see the real blockchain anymore, and will remain on the attacker's fork even if the real blockchain gets more work. This is a pretty dangerous situation. Note this situation might *in practice* work out slightly different (in regard to isolation only), at least for "mere" block size changes, but merely accepting such invalid blocks is still a risk.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:21:49

1. There is no "the mempool": each node has its own mempool, usually different.

Instead of a GitHub, wouldn't it make more sense to try to improve the [existing wiki page]( :)
Anyhow, my comments:


Everyone notable AFAIK agrees the block size needs to be increased. I would clarify here, that the concern is that the volume will increase *in the next year* more than double what it has been after 6 years until now.




Is this inclusive of OpenTransactions? I'm not sure it's quite fair to classify that as simply "third parties", at least considering the more common centralised services that fit this category better. In other words, I think OT and similar things ought to be 1.1b.




This is not possible with Lightning. Mike Hearn's claim that it is possible with StrawPay suggests these are two significantly different things.


An implementation is not needed to observe that the design is sound, and therefore a sure solution.




The changes are less than for a block size increase, so it isn't really an argument for that.


Moore's Law has apparently never applied to bandwidth, or at least not in recent years where the average increase is only 15% annually.


A temporary measure *to prevent miners from spamming*. Yet this problem has *not* been addressed in any other way since, and the spam problem is at least as significant (I would say more) as it was back then.


The last hardfork increasing the block size to 1 MB was performed with merely 2 months notice.


I'm not sure this is a real argument. More changes in a single hardfork make it that much more difficult - it may be easier to roll out N hardforks one at a time, than all at once.




More like References? I'd suggest adding more reputable sources such as developers' reddit/mailing list posts.
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:30:01


It's not true. v0.8.1 scheduled a hardfork for 2013 May 15 (2 months out from release), to raise the max block size from ~500 kB (not measured in actual bytes, so I'm estimating) to 1 MB.


Ok, that was a softfork then, yes.
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:12:17

@_date: 2015-06-11 01:43:41
Even full nodes without 8333 open still contribute to some degree. It's not really practical/ethical to count them, however.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:17:36
They do allow you to turn it (Multibit HD) off. Maybe an option to empty the wallet (ie, to change to another wallet) without the client fee would be an improvement in this area though... (if it's not already available)
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:16:00
There is no "slapfight" when people are in agreement. The last block size increase (from ~500k to 1 MB, in 2013) achieved consensus in under 24 hours (IIRC) and was deployed with 2 months notice in 0.8.1.

Humans should never handle individual ECDSA private keys manually. Not even expert core developers like myself can provide the necessary guarantees to do this safely.
@_date: 2015-06-25 16:33:01
Ok, point conceded. You're right, there is arguably a general economic interest for devs to want scalable solutions earlier rather than later. But I don't think this is contrary to the best interests of Bitcoin, nor is it the reasons behind why increasing the block size right now is a bad idea.
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:08:54


Sadly, I believe the answer is "none". Apparently none of them took the risk seriously. :(


IMO the goal of changing the PoW is to send a clear message to manufacturers that the network won't tolerate their abuse of position, and can reactively overcome it at great loss to the self-miners, therefore manufacturers of the next-PoW ASIC should not abuse their position. This won't be effective if they make most of their profit before we hardfork.

I think it is rational to care about Bitcoin's future. Allocating 5% of the block to priority transactions seems more than reasonable. "Rational" does not necessarily mean "profit-only". There are also de facto miners who *explicitly do* use and want the priority policy support.

1. There is no BIP 248.
2. SW allows up to 4x\* the data without a hardfork, but that's still data - so 2/4/8 just means *that data* is allowed to expand the blocks up to 2-8 MB. It's not 4x 2/4/8 MB.
3. Your schedule for 2/4/8 is too fast. Make it every subsidy halving and it should be okay.
4. \* In theory SW could allow for more than 4x, especially with sidechain proofs.
@_date: 2015-12-08 06:05:25

You can publish your recommendations, just like anyone else (that's why we have the BIP process, remember) - but if you want Bitcoin to adopt it, you also need consensus just like anyone else.
@_date: 2015-06-25 17:25:01
Generally, there would be a private key, which generates a read-only seed, which generates many ECDSA public keys, each of which can generate one address. When someone sends to the address, the ECDSA public key is associated with the UTXO created, but the UTXO is not itself tied to the address - the owner of the address may spend the bitcoins without the UTXO being redeemed, or vice-versa (the UTXO might be redeemed in a transaction unrelated to the owner of the address).
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:15:37
This is nonsense. Nothing has been abandoned. The federated peg system was always considered a necessary step 1 of implementation (see Appendix A of the whitepaper). For decentralised sidechains, we need a softfork in Bitcoin - and before that happens, we need to prove the viability of it all. The federated peg sidechain is an ideal testing ground for that.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:25:57
No, I can't think of any way to do this in a blockchain with confidential transactions. You can prove the sum is &lt;21M, but you can't find out exactly how many there are. Considering that you can't prove which UTXOs are unspendable anyway, I don't know that there is any significant functionality lost by this.

Unfortunately, if you do that, then people tend to just abuse other opcodes to disguise their data as hashes. This makes it *worse* because you can no longer prove they're data, and therefore full nodes *must* store them in the UTXO set or risk breaking consensus with the rest of the network.

Changing consensus rules without consensus is making an altcoin. That is what makes altcoins what they are.


AFAIK even Gavin opposes actual 1 MB blocks in the near future. The hardfork would only be a change to the hard limit, and miners would be expected to stay below 1 MB for quite some time. I take no position against the hardfork proposals themselves (although I think they are a bad idea). In any case, the final decision is made by merchants/exchanges, not developers.


There have been a number of changes made, of both kinds (soft and hard) that have gone just fine despite your claim of "ill-defined". The hard limit was just increased to 1 MB\* two years ago, without any controversy.
\* The old limit was not measured the same way, but effectively made 1 MB blocks impractical.

Bitcoin Core already does that, except only seed nodes are supported right now. BitTorrent's ability to work without all nodes being seeds, is I think dependent on the assumption that all nodes *want* to become seeds: so even if you don't connect to a seed directly, your non-seeds will eventually become seeds themselves. That doesn't hold true for pruned Bitcoin nodes, so it's a little more complex to get right.

Miners *can* mine *empty blocks only* with just the header. However, doing so makes them and SPV nodes all *highly vulnerable to attack*.

ASICs actually improved decentralisation at first. We started with CPUs (realistically, 2 manufacturers), went to GPUs (1 vendor in practice: AMD), then FPGAs (1 in practice again), and then ended up with about 5-10 ASIC designs.
It is only recently that the manufacturers have been so completely abusing their position to self-mine, and I am borderline on proposing a PoW hardfork to counteract this.
@_date: 2015-06-07 03:50:55
You're confusing Bitcoin with the blockchain. Lightning networks are still Bitcoin, and is how Bitcoin will scale. Furthermore, there is no refusal to allow changes: the decision not to increase the block size limit *at this time* is based on 1) a lack of capacity, which will change as technology advances, and 2) a lack of necessity, since we only use 300-400k blocks right now. Should these change, the block size limit may change as well.
@_date: 2015-06-20 23:04:28
Why? It's fine how it is.
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:56:50
This is precisely why I don't actually oppose removing* of the hard limit: because miners can be expected to keep the soft limit reasonable (softfork-like if necessary) until a future time.
My current recommendation for pool operators and miners, is to use 400k as their soft limit. But it's also important that miners make their own independent decisions with regard to policies, and not simply use someone else's recommendation at face value.
\* I don't oppose removing or raising the hard limit, but I *do* strongly oppose making such a change without consensus as Gavin and Mike are now proposing.
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:24:09

There is no "the soft limit". Soft limits are strictly miner policy, and not something developers or anyone other than *that individual miner* has any authority over. The point of the limit is to prevent *miners* from spamming. Thus, your suggestion here doesn't really make sense in any meaningful way.

As I understand it, they have done this because they perceive it to have too big of an impact on the latency of CreateNewBlock because their pool servers are poorly designed.
The performance penalty for calculating priority has been pretty much solved before this change, however, so that excuse should be gone in 0.12 regardless.
Edit: Also note, that Chinese miners are not *all* the miners, and while it might have justified a default change, it certainly does not justify the general direction of *removing* priority support altogether, much less making it difficult to re-add, which would impact *all* the miners. Changing the default has only been justified thus far, on the basis of the direction of removing it entirely, *not* on the basis of what's currently popular configuration.
@_date: 2015-12-23 07:07:37

Online games only do this by being closed source and tightly controlled in a dictatorship fashon - and even then it's possible to hack at them. Basically it works by making the client tell the server (or other clients) his own version, and the other end refusing to communicate with you if you report an older version. In other words, you can just lie to get the other side to accept your custom software.
Anyhow, this is inherently contradicting with Bitcoin's decentralised design.
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:20:48

The goal for the hard limit is not what is optimal for miners, but what is a reasonable extreme without causing unnecessary centralisation. As we have seen over the past years, 1 MB is probably too high.

Bigger blocks makes it harder to run a full node. If you're not running a full node, you're essentially using someone else's full node as your trusted third-party. In effect, the blockchain has become just another Coinbase holding your funds for you. Only the elite few who can run their own full node can now benefit from Bitcoin.
I'm saying centralising unimportant things is a good temporary solution if the alternative is centralising *everything*.


The problem is that the Bitcoin network is *not really* capable of even 1 MB blocks today. So a more apt analogy would be that we're currently overclocking our "supercomputer" to 125% of what it's capable of, parts are failing (mining centralisation is already a problem, and full nodes have dropped 95% over the past year or so), and now some people are pushing to overclock it even more.


Not likely. We're at 300-400k (30-40%) after 6 years. We should at least be able to get 2-5 more years out of the remaining 70%.


The soft-cap is a miner choice. They can (and should) set it to whatever they want. Based on the graphs posted here, it seems the miner who wants to do what's best for Bitcoin ought to consider setting it to 400k for now regardless of what the hard limit is.

Not in practice. Fees work only as a metric for miners, who make the judgement. Unfortunately, the fees also are a reward for the miner, so when the spam pays a fee, the miner's short-term interests are not aligned with the network. The block size limit was added to prevent *miners* from putting their interests too far ahead by mining excessive spam.
@_date: 2015-06-29 07:42:07
Why use Bitcoin at all, if you're just going to keep it with a centralised entity?
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:49:48


No? I'm not sure what you're referring to here.


The fact that &gt;90% can sit on a panel at all, means mining is absurdly broken and the community ought to hardfork them out of relevance.
But more importantly, miners *have no authority at all* in the case of hardforks such as block size increases; they have *nothing to delegate*.
While it makes sense for the decision-makers in the economy to listen to developers as topic experts, the end decision lies with them, and they cannot avoid the responsibility by simply deferring the decision to us.

SegWit allows turning some block size changes into a softfork. So BIP 103 would be possible to adapt to it as part of the softfork.
Also, no point deploying a hardfork together with a softfork. Might as well just do both as a hardfork in that case.
@_date: 2015-12-12 08:11:54


No, I do not. Nor do more of us. For those who do, it is for fulfiling the janitorial task of merging code that has been generally agreed on, not for their own personal judgement.


Again, there is no investment unless you are contributing money to development in some way. If you are, then sure, you have a reasonable right to ask those whom receive it for such reports. But otherwise, to the extent that we do so is an act of *charity*, not something we have in any way a moral responsibility to do.




But it is. Don't rant about developer "responsibilities", and then refuse to take on your own real responsibilities. If you neglect your duty to discern what software to adopt rather than blindly trusting what we release, you have nobody to blame but yourself.




If the entire community actually wanted XT, then adopting it against merely the developers' will would make sense. Although you may lose all charitable coding we do in the process, but that isn't something we ever had an obligation to do either.


I have to turn down a lot of work simply due to time constraints. If Blockstream started to ask me to lie, I could simply stop working for them and accept the other work instead - so there is really no financial influence in this case.


Sorry, but I'm pretty sure it only seems this way because you believe you are entitled to something you are not, and I am calling you out on it.

That script is not a standard p2pkh, and you can't just make up scripts or addresses for other people and expect them to respect it as valid. To produce a valid address, it would need to be p2sh, and to do that, you'd need to coordinate with the recipient's wallet somehow.

At least Bitfury and KnCMiner are self-mining, and at least KnCMiner does not plan to sell their hardware (Bitfury has not stated either way). Only these two have announced chips under 0.1 J/Gh, which means everything else will soon be obsolete.


I expect anything new to go rather quickly to GPUs, and probably not long to FPGAs. Hopefully when ASICs are produced, the manufacturers will have learned from SHA256d and will not self-mine.

As long as the inputs are all bitcoins and are not double-spent, the transaction will eventually confirm on *both* blockchains.
The logical outcome of this, if most people only accept bitcoins (which is in their interest) for payment, is that there will be *no benefit* to the 20 MB blockchain, since your transactions will need to wait to confirm the 1 MB blockchain anyway.

For online, I'd advise merchants to wait the standard 6-block confirmation.
For retail, I'd probably have extended the payment protocol in some way to include something where your personal identity is revealed to BitPay if you double-spend the payment, and then file lawsuits against thiefs as needed until the fraud rate drops to a level the rest can be insured against. I know this idea won't be popular, but it is pretty much the best option with the current system. Lightning will change that entirely, by making instant confirmation possible.
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:10:37
They're also *centralised mining pools*. This is a serious regression that needs to be addressed: Bitcoin needs *decentralised* mining. To use pool resources as a relevant factor not only ignores the needs of regular users (full nodes), but also makes decentralised mining essentially impossible.
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:38:30


That's because miners are being lazy - complain to them and their pools. Eligius has had it rolled out since 2012.
When people start experiencing delays for their transactions in a few years, that will encourage them to start using Lightning.


Yes, that's why it doesn't seem to work in practice, and part of why the block size limit is necessary. Maybe when difficulty catches up to price finally, and there are no profits to be made, perhaps then the for-profit miners will start getting rid of their hardware and letting people who care take over.


Lightning only works if you can settle on the blockchain. Settlement is a blockchain transaction. So you need a full node to be secure with Lightning too. Note that unlike traditional money, Lightning settlements are between individuals, not between payment hubs or banks.

It's highly probable that if there were actually problems on the horizon, there would be consensus for a hardfork within 24 hours (like last time, in 2013, when we hardforked to raise the block size limit to 1 MB).


No, the community has not. Only 1% of nodes are running XT even after all the hype. Seems to me it's mostly trolls and sockpuppets, with a minority of users deceived into thinking it's a good idea.

First, the UTXO has a script; that script includes/uses a hash of a public key in a wallet. The public key, and the hash of the public key, are *not* the same thing as a Bitcoin address. The Bitcoin address, while technically *implemented using* such scripts, keys, and hashes,  is an opaque identifier that indicates the recipient of the transaction (which is a person, not a wallet). The UTXO created in the process is an internal component to the wallet, not specific to the recipient nor his address.

Yes, that's a matter of math. But no, I don't have a link and don't have time to hold your hand through it. Maybe someone else will engage you to that extent.


Yep, lots of that is readily apparent. Nodes continue to drop off the network; miners have ceased validating blocks; etc.


No, soft-forks require the miners to act, and since this limit is for *restricting miners*, it is unreasonable to think they will do so. Especially when you consider how negligent miners are already with their current powers.


By the time that becomes apparent, the damage would be irreversible.


No, 2.5 years.


It means nodes must be *capable* of every block hitting that limit.


We aren't hitting the block size limit, and empty blocks are inevitable no matter what the block size limit or transaction volume simply due to how mining works.

Not nearly. Beyond 250 kB blocks is already pushing my 5/0.5 Mbit DSL. 1 MB blocks needs better than 2 Mbit upload. And even more if you want to mine without taking a big hit.


I find that hard to believe.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:32:23
Theory != reality. The only time I'd expect a fee-less transaction today to take more than the next block to get mined, is when it gets caught in the miner's spam filter(s), or someone else is spamming the network.

As you seem to know already, coins don't come from addresses at all.
For financial auditors (what I assumed), they don't care where bitcoins get sent anyway.
For "better make sure people aren't buying drugs" auditors, they would likely get a list what addresses and other accounts each account sent to - but even in this case, they have no need to know what addresses your account has (ie, for receiving).
(note, I'm assuming a sane design, which I know Coinbase didn't have originally at least)

I find the wording here (if accurate) to be disturbing. Do Chinese pools plan to *actually* increase their block sizes?

Please clarify and (if applicable) strongly reconsider.

Bitcoin Core can be configured to execute a command whenever it detects such an unusual condition with the "alertnotify" configuration option, however.

Blockchain fees are almost certainly too low today (the default was changed to 1/10th of its previous value *without any discussion or agreement*\* by Mike Hearn in 0.9). If Bitcoin ever gets big, it's going to get more expensive than credit cards for small transactions. Lightning should always be cheaper than the blockchain for money you're actually spending on a regular basis.
\* It was proposed as a "fix" for a bug that was only semi-related. Since it did effectively eliminate the bug as a workaround, and the release was already late, it was accepted into the code. But the change of default itself was never discussed or agreed on. It's not strictly Mike's fault, but it's a bit interesting how things turned out.

The willingness of people to spam the blockchain indicates the block size is at least as necessary today as it ever was. We simply do *not* have real volume to get past an average ~350k/block, which is the only metric that matters in this way.

1. Blocks are based on the previous block. So until  is found, you don't know what the foundation for  will be, and can't start working on it. Besides, it wouldn't do you any good.
2. No, just less than the current target. 2a. Uh, no. This isn't even possible because of what a hash is...
3. Miners start over frequently. You know how miners have ratings in terms like 1 Th/s? That means they start over 1,000,000,000,000 times every second.

It might cost more fees to use Lightning for money you do not intend to use. So you would want to only maintain your spending amount on the Lightning network, and keep your savings on the blockchain. Also, since everything done on the Lightning network must be settled to the blockchain, the chance of anything "cancelling out" a large purchase is significantly smaller - so it's just simpler to do the purchase on the blockchain directly and wait an hour for it to confirm. IMO, anyway - maybe others will disagree and use Lightning for everything.

Miners are the ones who have to *obey* the block size limit. If they don't, they're simply mining invalid blocks. Developers just write code, they can't force anyone to use it.
The ones who have influence over the consensus rules are the people investing new resources into Bitcoin: the people you want to accept your payment of Bitcoin for goods (or fiat currency, in the case of exchangers).

And will continue to have excess capacity for at least a few more years, even if nothing improves.


No, the burden of proof is on the one who wants to make changes to the consensus protocol. Besides, there is plenty of sound reasoning/evidence that hitting the limit is beneficial - you *can't* get any better than that without actually doing it. If you want to test it out before 1 MB, then please feel free to convince miners to collectively reduce the soft limit for all blocks to 400k for a few months (or at least until your expected "major disaster" starts to show a possibility of happening).

Miners can select minimum fees they require, but if your competition accepts lower fees, you'll just end up mining empty blocks while they get *all* the fees. You can't make it a consensus rule because miners can just pad the transactions with bogus "fees" for free (not to mention the variable value of bitcoin).

LOL, somehow being Catholic makes me divine now? Do you think calling me a "nutter" makes you look good? XD


False premise. It doesn't benefit Blockstream at all.


The only scalability solution we're funding is Lightning, and we started funding it because it is beneficial to Bitcoin. There are also no competing solutions - increasing the block size limit doesn't solve anything.


It certainly won't be "all hail Satoshi". If he came out and said something, it would merely refute all the Satoshi-idolators once and for all.


I haven't seen evidence of this. Gavin claimed most merchants were onboard a few months ago, but when I went and asked them explicitly, they denied it... And miners are irrelevant to the block size limit.

Unconfirmed transactions can always be double spent, with or without RBF. RBF doesn't make fraud any easier (it's already easy), only legitimate double spending. So the answer is "yes", but it was already "yes" before RBF, and there is nothing wallets can do to change it to a "no" either way.


Only to make use of it. This opens up a lot of room to improve wallets.

Most people won't dedicate the resources needed for 1 MB blocks to running a full node. Instead, they do in fact opt for trusting third parties.


So you're saying nobody will use the Bitcoin system itself no matter how little resources it needs? That is pretty pessimistic, and also inconsistent with the answers given when people are asked "Why aren't you running a full node?"

Block propagation time is, as you say, *only* one of the issues with increasing the size limit. A much bigger issue is the centralisation pressures it puts on full nodes. Further, all efforts to reduce block propagation time thus far (AFAIK) have serious inherent centralisation effects on mining. People can put bounties on workable solutions - but doing so is quite similar to putting bounties on finding security issues: the probability of success is small, so it is generally not worth risking time doing the research and risk not finding anything (and therefore not collecting the bounty). For something like this, you're going to need to fund research regardless of its results (or lack thereof). And when you're done, you've merely solved *one* of the issues preventing the block size from getting *linearly* larger - which won't help at all in the long term. This is why we generally focus on practical solutions like Lightning that not only make Bitcoin far more efficient, but also buy us decades before the block size needs any increase.

No, the number is relevant to new users. The security of the network depends more on percentage too.


Exponentially? Not so sure. We haven't seen CPU frequencies increase significantly in like a decade, and bandwidth only improves 15% *on average* each year... Storage and RAM isn't a big/relevant issue for Bitcoin at the moment, but it sure doesn't seem exponential either.


This seems reasonable. But keep in mind block sizes are ~300-400k right now. So to mimic networking improvements, we'd want to go to 460k blocks next year, 529k after that, then 608k, 700k, 804k, 925k, and finally break the current limit of 1 MB in 2020.

In terms of perception, 140 tps isn't much better than 7, IMO.
In regard for perception, I would suggest pointing out that Bitcoin does *not* have a 7 tps limit, only its blockchain does. There is an unlimited number of tps using off-chain transactions, which can be done today using centralised systems, and almost certainly done trustlessly using Lightning within a few years.

There is no such thing as ASIC resistance. Any algorithm can be specialised. The best you can do is try to design an algorithm that people *already* have an ASIC for. This is the goal of memory-hard algorithms (ie, memory is the ASIC), but none of them to date have been successful at meeting the requirements for proof-of-work.
What we *can* do, however, is simply hardfork to change PoW whenever manufacturers abuse their position. I'm getting rapidly convinced we should do this soon.

It reduces the network's security more than changing the block size.
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:40:07
Downloading a block over 10 minutes is not enough. Even if you're not contributing, over 63% of blocks are found in under 10 minutes - and that's *without* the difficulty increasing. For a contributing node, you also need to be able to upload the block rather quickly - 30 seconds would be the maximum reasonable time here - to multiple peers.
So the real math should be:
    20 MB = 160 Mbit
    30 seconds to download the block = 30
    160 / 30 = 5.33 Mbps downstream
    8 peers minimum = 8
    160 Mbit * 8 peers = 1280 Mbit
    30 seconds to upload the block = 30
    1280 / 30 = 42.67 Mbps upstream
And if most people were only able to make the 30+30 second mark, blocks would take *minutes* to relay across the network. So even with global average of 6/43 internet, you can forget mining anonymously - you *need* to be part of the central miner backbone now.
@_date: 2015-06-12 04:47:03
BIP34 was a soft-fork, which meant it was backward compatible with the old consensus protocol and only miners needed to switch/upgrade. This works cleanly because miners can indicate their support in their blocks, and a 51% majority of miners can actually force it on the rest of the network by essentially performing a 51% "attack" against the miners who didn't switch.
The block size, however, is a hard-fork, which is *not* backward compatible: all existing nodes will *reject* the new blockchain as completely invalid, and will never use it no matter how many miners support it. It would be the same as if miners decided they were going to get 5000 BTC per block instead of 25 BTC. Therefore, every single node, miner or not, must switch to become compatible with the new protocol. And unfortunately, there is no way to securely measure node adoption, nor if we could, for even a majority of nodes to force the new rule on dissenting nodes. The only way to force nodes to adopt a new protocol, is if the merchants and exchanges all switch first, and the old Bitcoin becomes worthless "overnight". Basically a hard-fork entails literally creating an altcoin and convincing everyone to use it.

That's more than I can upload in a month if I max out my connection! 0.5 Mbit = 162 GB
Consider also that for the network to function, people need to relay the block to their peers *quickly*; so to be a contributing full node, assume 8 peers within 30 seconds (a generous amount of time for this purpose). In the end, the realistic requirements are 43 Mbit upstream for 20 MB blocks.

You never have to include a fee, but miners have no reason to mine your transaction unless you do. Transfers in either direction need to be mined on both sides, so you should expect to offer 2 fees (one on each blockchain) for each transfer.

Only ones paying no or low fees. Just including a minimum standard fee got transactions confirmed in the very next block. 8 hours isn't bad in any case.


Not for non-spam, which is kinda the point.


The blockchain isn't supposed to be realtime. At a minimum, a transaction takes an hour to get the full 6 block confirmation. It's perfectly reasonable for low-fee transactions to take a day to confirm, and one might even *expect* to see that in a healthy blockchain.
@_date: 2015-12-22 11:34:07


Sounds like what SW is proposing to do better...


No... 8 MB requires at least 17 Mbps upstream for the average node.
8 MB * 8 peers / 30 seconds * 8 bits/byte = 17,066,666 bits/sec.


VPS is under someone else's physical control, so you might as well not have a node at all...


Raspberry Pi probably couldn't even keep up with 1 MB blocks if we got there. [Everyone]( is the target group and should ideally be able to run their own node under their own physical control.

Yes. The current model in Alpha uses a normal P2SH multisig, so the functionaries all verify the signed block and then sign a transaction redeeming the coins on testnet.

There are literally *zero* legitimate non-monetary applications of the Bitcoin blockchain, almost by definition, so yes, *hopefully* Lightning and/or other improvements will destroy spam as much as possible.
Proof-of-existence/"notary" does not need to spam the blockchain. Proof-of-ownership does not exist. Coloured coins are monetary and Lightning-compatible (in theory). Voting systems have no sane use of the blockchain. None of these have any reason to be abusing OP_RETURN.
The rare use case which actually needs a blockchain for non-monetary purposes (eg, "BitDNS" aka Namecoin) can just as well use a sidechain.

Nope, they are skipping verification. Due to the block size, the benefit they gain from this is (at least in their perception) greater than the risk of their blocks being actually invalid and rejected, *even after* that *did* occur following block v3 deployment.


Your link was *never* introduced... that was a proposed block size increase to 7 MB.
In 2013, we discovered that the effective block size limit was in fact more like 500k, and in v0.8.1 (released 1 week later) deployed a hardfork to increase it to 1 MB, scheduled for 2 months after that.


No, XT proponents have been spamming the blockchain in order to try to make the claim blocks are full to justify their cause. There is no evidence *actual transaction volume* has increased so significantly.


And that is mostly because wallet software is immature and not user friendly. That area appears to be slow to improve, so I doubt we'll see mass adoption for at least a few more years.


In 2011, even 500 kB blocks would have been very quickly fatal to Bitcoin. We're lucky miners haven't been *that* negligent until recently.

The "point" is decentralised money. Nobody is proposing 1 MB blocks forever, just *actually scaling* and *actually having a need* before increasing it.

If blocks are full, the recipient can always include a higher fee to get it mined more urgently. Even if he doesn't, the funds would not revert back to the sender in any case other than fraud. Miners could clearly see such fraud, and could provide an additional level of protection by refusing to mine it. It's *far* easier to double-spend an ordinary unconfirmed transaction.


This seems like a very reasonable *and* probable outcome. Not because of block size or scalability, though: even if there was no cost to using the blockchain, retail merchants are obviously going to favour instant confirmation and zero fraud over 1-hour confirmation-or-some-%-fraud.


Does it matter, as long as they charge you less than the fee to put those same transactions on the blockchain? If they charge too much, then just run your own Lightning hub.

The actual comparison seems to ignore the fact that CoinJoin+ConfidentialTx basically just works (although it's mentioned in the conclusion). The conclusion also erroneously equates CoinJoin to a kind of mixing and from there says it causes blockchain bloat, but CoinJoin does not bloat at all (in fact, it *reduces* blockchain use). So the only advantage I see to ZeroCash is smaller proofs... and I'm not sure the risk of an undetectable compromise is worth that. Especially when you consider the same zk-SNARK technology can be used with the block verification itself.

The solution Bitcoin has always used, was for miners to not mine/confirm spam. You can still transact bitcoins without confirmation by the blockchain, it's just insecure. The only way to solve security with modern technology is for *everyone* to know about the transaction.

Going from ~200k blocks to ~400k blocks has seen a loss of 95% of full nodes. When people are asked why they no longer run, or don't wish to run a full node, the answer usually comes down to the block(chain) size.

If you have any suggestions for how to improve Eligius, feel free to let me or wizkid057 (who has been running it for recent years) know. Obviously we need to avoid address reuse, but that's more difficult than is apparent for us. Whether addresses are being reused or not, however, is unrelated to the status of spam. Eligius sends transactions only for reasonable payout amounts, and does not use them for anything other than miners receiving their money. This is not remotely similar to SatoshiDice's spamming the blockchain as if it were a TCP-like messaging system.

The plan was, that if manufacturers self-mined rather than selling hardware, the network would hardfork to another algorithm (probably some near variant of SHA256d) to make their hardware useless until they learned not to do it.
All ASIC manufacturers were therefore advised that their chips should be designed with some kind of "alternative PoW mode" that could be supported in such a scenario (ie, so the ASICs they sold to people would continue working after such a hardfork, while only the ASICs of self-miners would break). Assuming they did that, the new PoW would be "Avalon variant *OR* BFL variant *OR* ...", and miners with that hardware would continue to secure the network.

The evidence would actually suggest a reduction is a good idea at least temporarily. But is it worth the effort to argue? That's not so likely to be true. Also note the decision-makers are different groups: while an increase is a hardfork and falls to merchants/exchanges, a decrease is a softfork and falls to miners. Miners can also individually reduce their own block sizes on policy alone.
@_date: 2015-06-05 02:49:33
Definitely not. With mining centralisation the way it is, you might even want to wait 8.
Edit: To be clear, I am suggesting this if someone running a service wants to be *certain* they are never double-spent.

Not quite. Fees are, as always, strictly miner *policy* and not decided by the network or development team. What is being discounted, is the size of the data toward the block size limit. So 100 bytes of witness data only counts as 25 bytes toward that limit.


This example is incorrect (with the current concept) because the 80 bytes of signature/witness still count at 25%. So in terms of the 1 MB limit, it counts as 90 + (80 / 4) = 110 bytes.


I haven't figured out how to accurately detect all the latest waves of spam that started over this past summer, but considering we were only about 1/3 of the way earlier this year, I find it very hard to believe we're anywhere near the limit yet. And with the deploy speed of CLTV, I wouldn't rule out SegWit as something we can pull off in the next 3 months.

To run a full node, you effectively *need* to be able to satisfy the limits. If there are no limits, you *need* infinite resources. When the majority of full nodes cannot satisfy the limits, you end up with nodes failing at different blocks due to their varying physical limitations, which results in a complete failure of the consensus system.
Also note that the networking code in Bitcoin Core today cannot handle blocks larger than 32 MB, and having no explicit limit would turn this networking code into consensus code, breaking the desired abstraction and making it harder to correctly implement a full node.

The network's resources can't really even handle 1 MB block sizes today, let alone 3 MB. The only reason I've chosen to remain neutral in the limit decision, is because it's only talking about the *hard limit*, not the soft limit miners use (which can remain &lt;1 MB even with a hard limit increase) and therefore not the *actual* block size. It's quite expected that anyone who opposes 20 MB will likely oppose any increase simply because we can't handle it yet.

I can only upload 162 GB per month if I max out my 0.5 Mbit upload. So I couldn't even support a single peer.

How many people do you know who can relay 20 MB to multiple peers *quickly*?


Higher price doesn't mean more full nodes at all. I'd have to spend $30000 to upgrade my connection, and even if the price went up enough to make that for me, that doesn't mean it's the logical thing to spend my money on.

This is similar to the Catholic concept of usury, except:
* Interest is permissible to counter-act inflation. So if the $1M you loaned is now worth only $500k, it's permissible to accept $2M (with the original value) as payment.
* I don't think the profit-sharing model would be considered an acceptable workaround. Basically he is asking for repaying of the money *plus shares in the "business"*. This is still usury AFAIK.
What is normally done, AFAIK (but I don't take out loans...), is that *instead* of making a loan of money, the "bank" would buy (eg) the house at the agreed-on price, and then resell that house to the intended final purchaser at a higher price (to be paid over time).

After a block is found, the node needs to calculate the transactions to put in the next block and transmit that list to the miners. While they are waiting for that, most good miners will work on empty blocks rather than wasting electricity on the previous block (which was already found). Even empty blocks benefit the network, since they improve the confirmation on the rest of the blockchain prior to them.

Everyone needs to download the entire blockchain once, regardless of whether the txs are spent or not. Archive nodes therefore need to store it so people have somewhere to download it from. Pruned full nodes can discard spent transactions after they are checked.

Nothing has changed. It is still something we all agree needs to happen at some point.

Jeff appears to have forgotten that even with a softfork, non-miner nodes still enforce the rules once they update. A rule enforced only by miners is equivalent to *permanently* making miners the *only* full nodes...
So this BIP can be either interpreted as one of:
1. Only miners may run full nodes.
2. Raise the hard block size limit to an adjustable-by-miner-vote 2 MB.
The former is a terrible idea IMO. The latter is a bad idea for the same reason 20 MB was a bad idea (still too large), but obviously an improvement (over 20 MB) - it would need to be clarified as such in the BIP first, however.

This is mostly correct: 0.8.0 was in this case accidentally an altcoin, while 0.7 retained the network consensus (IIRC about 90% of nodes at the time). The 0.8 altcoin was in used by ~75% of miners.


No, miners had to *downgrade* their nodes, or otherwise emulate the consensus rules of Bitcoin 0.7. This came at a significant cost to some miners (especially BTCGuild, which IIRC had to re-do the initial blockchain download, and allowed miners to steal bitcoins from them due to a bug in their software while the transition was in process). Note the critical factor here was *not* the 90% support, but the lowest-common-denominator: both versions accepted the 0.7/Bitcoin blockchain, while only the 0.8/altcoin blocks were rejected by 0.7 nodes. In the block size matter, this *always* points to the *smallest* block size (which is why a reduction of the limit is only a softfork).


No, the one to be abandoned would be the one rejected by the consensus protocol rules (currently 1 MB blocks). It's no different than if miners decided to change the genesis block, or make their subsidy 40 BTC instead of 25 BTC.
@_date: 2015-06-05 18:47:46


That's the *only* way to define a consensus protocol, at least today. Anything else *cannot* work.

Increasing block size has the potential to reduce security. Reducing the block time *guarantees* reducing security. Additionally, there are in fact no benefits to this approach. Waiting 2 minutes is no more acceptable for "instant" transactions than 10 minutes, and to get the same security 6 blocks provides today, you would instead need to wait 30 blocks.

It's big enough to break "every user has his own full node", which is a necessary premise for Bitcoin's security today. Note this is *already* broken before we've hit 1 MB blocks, as evidenced by the 95% full node drop over the past years with most people answering the reason is block[chain] size.
Compared to the current status quo (already broken to that degree): If all blocks were 1 MB, it would become impossible to run a full node on simple ARM systems. It's *tolerable*, and probably wouldn't *break* too much... but it's pretty close to the edge right now.

Unconfirmed transactions are insecure even *without* a 51% attack - it is *never* secure to treat them as irreversible, and you're pretty much *begging* to be defrauded if you do.
A 51% attack is only needed to double-spend a transaction that has been confirmed to some degree. Also, despite its name, it can be performed imperfectly *without* 51% (30% gives you a good chance).

Make the to-be-mined transaction 100k with lots of inputs. This will propagate the network slowly, since nodes need to download 100k, verify every signature, and then upload 100k to each peer. Send this first, to mining nodes.
Make the not-to-be-mined transaction tiny, with only one input and one output. Broadcast this immediately after the mining nodes receive their version. Ideally, go for nodes you observe to be nearby your target.
It may not be 100% successful, but you lose nothing when it fails.

Yes, that's why Bitcoin has an intelligent/human component: the miners. Miners are supposed to make decisions to help filter the spam and low priority traffic, so the real transactions aren't affected. The simplest way to do this is to increase the minimum transaction fee.

Actually 30 seconds is on the high end of time you want block downloads to take. Anything more and propagation just starts to fall apart. If you're an outlier, maybe barely keeping up at 10 minute download times is acceptable - but if most people need that long, Bitcoin has died.

Post-quantum signatures have various practical problems today. I'm only slightly familiar with one: Lamport signatures. They're *large* in data size, and reusing them *guarantees* a break. Your NTRU link says it is patented, so we couldn't use that (so I didn't bother to look at its properties).
It's not usually discussed anymore. Obviously we've had discussions enough to have a vague idea of our response plan should quantum computers suddenly exist, but not much more.
It seems likely that Schnorr signatures will be merged at some point for speed reasons (it's already used in the Elements Alpha sidechain), but I don't think that it's any more resilient to quantum computers than ECDSA.

I don't consider it a priority since we're so far from hitting 1 MB, but yes, solving it would be nice. If we were bumping into 1 MB enough where low priority transactions took a day to get mined, I'd suggest we increase the limit to 2 MB to buy time.


By collapsing many transactions into one blockchain transaction, Lightning makes it practical for the normal transactions to pay a higher fee (now divided among all the Lightning transactions being collapsed) for getting mined. This leaves the flooding and inefficient use behind competitively, and restores the fee-based antispam mechanism to viability.

1. There is no "the mempool": each node has its own mempool, usually different.
2. You can't send bitcoins from an address, only to.
3. Reference spam protections have detected your scenario for a while. You would need a fee on every transaction to get them relayed.

You're completely ignoring/forgetting/unaware of the real costs?

Developers have no special power, and doing what others want is not necessarily for the good of mankind.


Implementing it would have no effect on its own. The community/network would need to adopt it. If they choose to do so, it isn't the developers' fault, but their own.


Not really. If the community adopts the change, we have little choice but to go along with it (or quit Bitcoin entirely).


I refuse to be held responsible for the empty promises others make.


Why? Blockchains are mostly *terrible* for storing information. There are much better ways to do this for a long time now.


People buying bitcoins are just exchanging currency, nothing more. If they want to invest in Bitcoin's future, they need to actually do something that works toward that future, either by developing themselves, or hiring people to do the development for them.


Long-term holders are basically irrelevant in terms of determining Bitcoin's future.


Then you don't have an investment in Bitcoin. You're still welcome to use it, of course, but don't expect to have any influence over where it goes (although you could practically gain such an influence if you have goods/services to sell for bitcoin payments, making you a part of the economic majority).


The people paying me don't get to control my opinions or what I do outside of the time and work they are paying me for.


You have the same access I do. Bitcoin development does not require any special privileges.

There is no such thing as "0-conf on-chain".
1. *Un*confirmed transactions are *not* confirmed. "1 conf" is short for "1-block-deep confirmation", but until the transaction is included in that 1 block, it is not confirmed *at all*.
2. Unconfirmed transactions are not on-chain. That's why they're unconfirmed. Perhaps you intended to contrast "on-chain" with "on Lightning", but *every single Lightning transaction can be mined and made on-chain*, so this contrast does not make any sense.


This implies double-spending is something that needs to be sanctioned. Only *fraudulent* double-spending is a problem, but this fraud is already possible a number of straightforward ways even without RBF. The double spending that RBF makes easier is the *honest* double-spending.

Suicide? Hardly. Mine one invalid block, get the other miners to build on it, and you've frozen the network. In the meantime, you have 100% hashpower to mine your own valid blockchain, and as soon as you release the invalid block, everyone will reject it no matter how much longer it is...

Most miners are filling their blocks with spam; they're not actually full. It's perfectly fine (actually a good thing) if the spam never gets confirmed. Also, "full" does not necessarily mean hitting the limit in this context; some miners have soft limits set to a more reasonable size.
ALSO, the transaction in question pays a fee of 0.00007278 BTC/kB, less than the "standard" minimum fee of 0.0001 BTC/kB. So many miners are probably going to ignore it even if that means making empty blocks. (@_date: 2015-06-22 06:51:12

It actually does! By making legitimate use far more efficient, it effectively makes the fees that spammers have managed to acquire so far worthless. If miners no longer have incentive to spam, then the original purpose of the block size limit is solved. In the immediate future, it also reduces the needs of block size to probably around ~10k average (with lots of room to grow before we hit 1 MB). Maybe there are other reasons we need a limit, but to pretend Lightning makes no progress in this area is stupid.


Maybe in a few decades.


No, it doesn't. The problems this statement summarised have basically been solved AIUI.


It's a solution to hitting the limit any time soon, and buys enough time so that we are unlikely to need to address it until a future time when it can simply be removed.


This depends on speculation on time to implement Lightning, and unreasonably optimistic hopes for Bitcoin's adoption.

Investor in what exactly? (Note that buying and/or holding bitcoins is *not* an investment.)


Doubling size at every halving of the subsidy is pretty much the most aggressive increase practically possible.


That's not enough. The economic majority needs to be running full nodes, or else the rules just cease to exist and miners are de facto trusted to run things more than the Fed is with the USD.


Non-Bitcoin abuse of the blockchain doesn't do that. However, it is possible to support all these other use cases just as well *without* bloating the blockchain. I think we should do and encourage that, but it isn't a personal priority of mine. But on the other hand, if anyone else wants advice on an everyone-wins approach to do something, feel free to ask me.

I don't pay any attention to bitnodes.io, I keep [my own statistics]( since 2012 June.
I also observe the nearly complete centralisation of mining (even before chip manufacturers began abusing their position for self-mining): people continuing to use centralised pools even when decentralisation options are available, simply because the centralisation is needed to relay new blocks quickly.

You need a way to prove fraud, which turns out is harder than Satoshi originally anticipated (or at least harder than I was aware until recently). Current "SPV" clients make no effort to do any kind of fraud proofs. The nature of SPV fraud proofs mandates that the SPV client must be *capable* of downloading and validating a number of full blocks itself.

Eh? You don't spend money more than 3 times every few months?


Maybe. But let's be realistic: we *aren't* going to see 2.5x the volume overnight just because &lt;anyone&gt; offers discounts using Bitcoin. It'll raise faster, but we'll have time to do a hardfork when/if it starts.

Either a result of spam DoS, or their transaction was misdetected as spam itself. A transaction paying the minimum standard fee even during the worst spamming attacks, still manages to get mined in the very next block.


The block size limit is *not* an "issue at hand". It is a theoretical far-future problem.


The block size limit prevents the spam from getting too excessive. Lightning indirectly solves the spam problem, so once it is deployed (probably before we get to 1 MB of real volume) we will be closer to being able to simply removing the limit.

98% of *what*, is the question...
If 98% of miners run XT, then Bitcoin nodes ignore them and the network hashrate to 2%; difficulty adjusts, and life moves on without the 98% of rogue miners.
If 98% of consumers run XT, then they're vulnerable to attack from rogue miners who produce blocks &gt;1MB.
If 98% of consumers + &gt;50% of miners run XT, then bitcoins gradually become invalid as the newly mined bitcoins on the XT blockchain get into circulation.
If 98% of merchants and &gt;50% of miners run XT, then they will gradually begin to reject payments using bitcoins "tainted" by new blocks mined, and everyone else gradually learns they can't buy products with their bitcoins, possibly decide they need to adopt XT, and the situation resolves. The 2% of merchants in the meantime get compromised and scammed, and the people who held Bitcoins mined after XT split lose some semi-random amount of bitcoins. Some might end up with their payments returned to them.
If 98% of merchants and consumers switch, everyone is vulnerable to exploit by rogue miners producing &gt;1MB blocks.
If 98% of merchants, consumers, and &gt;50% of miners switch, the network sheds the miner minority, and the remaining 2% of merchants/consumers are left vulnerable until they switch.
Any other interesting situations I missed?

So far, nobody has come up with a viable PoS system, and there is no evidence to suggest such a thing is even theoretically possible.
Smart property ASIC chips are mining ASICs that have a tiny bit of non-volatile storage for their owner's public key, and refuse to hash any work unless it has been signed by the owner. They also accept signed requests to transfer ownership, hence smart property: they can be atomically traded with a bitcoin transactions. But since they only process signed work, a compromised datacenter (for example) can only shut them off, not use them to perform an attack.

You are correct, the patch does not change any of the consensus rules of Bitcoin. Blocks with spammy transactions are accepted just as they always would be, and nodes running it will only slow it down unless they near or reach 100%.

Really? I thought it was by generating a PGP key and signing messages. What makes you think a blockchain is useful for identity?
@_date: 2015-06-06 22:38:41
Then who will incentivise the archive nodes needed for initial blockchain download? ;)
Besides, it's not *impossible*, just complicated: the downloader can just give the uploader a public key he thinks has received coins, and operate  in a limited SPV mode to setup the channel.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:47:21
Last I checked, we don't even have 1 year worth of *total work* with current mining technology. That is to say, if all the miners wanted to 51% attack the blockchain back to the start, it would take them less than a year to do it. And this is the metric you'd want to use for such a rule (not raw time), so it wouldn't have any effect right now.
Pruning is another matter: you aren't trusting anything, just discarding old data you no longer need. Pruning nodes can prune a lot more than all-but-the-last-year, but they can't bootstrap someone new.
Pruning, however, only works because the data has already been processed before being discarded. You still need to download the data to process it, and Bitcoin today can't skip that unless you trust *everything* (including the future).

This is a broken by design substitute for watch-only wallets and multisig. There is no use case where you should ever need to watch a single address.

It actually is, in most ordinary use today. Until those flood-network transactions get mined into the blockchain, the transaction ids could be modified at any moment, which effectively prevents you from using the *change output*. SegWit will fix this, but as it is today, there is a reasonable comparison to be made.
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:37:07


Actually, it can't work like that. Spammers are human beings, and can innovate new ways to bypass any filter. Notice how email spam has evolved over the decades.


Right now, the vast majority is easily identifiable by looking for patterns in the transaction scripts. No doubt when miners start doing their job, spammers will change gears to avoid those patterns, but it's only a matter of time now until we get to Lightning, which enables ordinary people to pay much higher fees than spam (by only using the blockchain for settlements, you split the blockchain-tx fee up among the N transactions being settled).

Well, almost, but not exactly in the way you imagine - contrary to popular misconception, bitcoins *aren't* held by addresses. What you would do (with a custom wallet app) is make all of your addresses P2SH, where the script is something like "private key X *or* both private keys Y and B"; then you put private key B in your will-locked safe (or give it to someone trusted to release it only when you die), and give private key Y to the intended recipient.
There has been occasional talk of a OP_BLOCKHEIGHT_GREATERTHAN_VERIFY which would provide automatic timelocking in scripts, but it isn't supported today unfortunately.

What you want to do is get SaruTobi to pay you less frequently in larger amounts. If they send you a penny each time, then you end up with a bag of pennies to spend, which is why your fees are higher. If they wait until you reach $1, then you'd be sending 2-3 coins, and getting a better rate.

Your source does not back up your assertion. p2pool earned less than Eligius during the periods of 1-14 Mar, 1-14 Apr, 1-14 May, and 1-14 Jun. Additionally, while 8 months may be reasonable to benchmark pools like BTCGuild and Eligius, it is probably still too short a period to account for p2pool's much higher variance. Finally, this benchmark fails to account for performance/error differences between the antminers being used.

No, nodes only forward transactions your software considers sufficiently non-spammy and non-risky. The mainline code currently considers everything risky by default, and does not forward them unless they meet a strict criteria. If they meet that criteria, it also applies some heuristics to determine if it thinks it is spam. This has been the case since v0.3, and Bitcoin would not be working at all today if it merely forwarded any valid transaction.

Two more things:

Maybe. One idea was to have the chip manufacturer include a digital signature mechanism in the chips so they can sign proof of their firmware. Another idea might be to make the platform be based on the idea of zk-SNARKs, which can provide a digital signature based on the actual code executed.

No, to realistically maintain a full node with 20 MB blocks you need 43 Mbit upstream. Your node merely not falling behind isn't really sufficient. $30k is the setup cost to get better than 0.5 Mbit upstream here.

A fraction of the computing power is far better than one centralised miner. With 0.07 W/Gh, the trend for electric costs to mine will be toward making *that* break-even. Which means existing hardware at 0.40+ W/Gh will be a 75% loss even if you ignore the upfront costs. Many people may mine at a small loss for "ideological" reasons, but 75% is a bit much, and there's no ideology in being a small sliver of a 99% dominated network anyway. So basically all the existing hardware is made worthless.
On the other hand, any manufacturers who implemented an alternative algorithm will get a chance to publish it, and the hardfork can add support for this variant - so perhaps *not all* ASICs will be broken. If newer gen chips forgot to maintain this, we might get "snapped back" to first gen ASICs though... you saved some, right?


As with other hardforks, this needs consensus from virtually all of Bitcoin users, and the actual decision-making will be the merchants.

Better mining pools have getblocktemplate for miners, which lets them be aware of what transactions are in the block. You could check that. Of course, as pools become more decentralised and miners able to change the transaction list on their own, it becomes less reliable...
@_date: 2014-12-16 06:54:00
Not *exactly*, but that is a close approximation...
Every Bitcoin user has consented to relay and store data for that purpose, so it's fair game. However, the same cannot be said of any other purpose - once you leave the realm of "remitting the currency units", suddenly you have the problem of forcing your data on someone who hasn't consented to it.
Personally, I think the consent can perhaps be stretched to concepts which are the same kind of financial transacting (eg, assets, betting, etc), but some things which are clearly abusive and harm others' ability to use it in the commonly-agreed way seem to be obviously inappropriate.
@_date: 2014-06-13 06:07:52

The percentage is actually more relevant. The number only matters in terms of archive nodes.


Stale blocks occur when miners don't find out about existing block N before they mine their own block N. The ideal operation for this is for miners to directly connect to each other and share blocks, but this is extremely centralised and makes controlling, censoring, or otherwise attacking Bitcoin relatively simple. Because of this, Bitcoin pretty much *need* the ability for miners to work more or less okay over the public p2p/flood network. So we need new blocks to traverse the entire network in well under a minute. When each node receives the block, it must first *validate* it, then pass it on to all of its peers. Validation is relatively slow, and gets slower the bigger blocks are. Same goes for uploading.

Using a web wallet is asking to be robbed. Even the best bitcoin+security experts can't reasonably keep a hot wallet secure long-term.

Mining pools aren't affected in the first place.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:23:23
Sure, there's an EC pubkey that usually controls a single coin. But even if you send multiple coins to a single address (which is broken), those coins are unrelated to each other. And the controlling EC key has no necessary relationship to the legal owner of the bitcoins, nor the sender of the transaction consuming it.
(As for recognising my nick, I am the primary author of the main bitcoin mining software, and mining pool software, a developer of Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind since 2011, founder of one of the oldest mining pools, and various other things - so yes, I know the system well..)

"Off-chain transactions" is a generic term for any transaction which occurs without using the Bitcoin blockchain. This could be done by sending funds between accounts within the same wallet (eg, from one Coinbase user to another), or potentially other more complicated systems.
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:26:30
A single EC keypair is not a wallet. Therefore, writing one down cannot logically be a paper wallet. Wallets by definition are capable of being comprised of many EC keypairs. HD seeds can do this on paper, but EC private keys cannot.

Whatever Peter Todd's motivations may or may not be, he is *not* "wrecking zeroconf security". *UN*CONFIRMED transactions are *unconfirmed* because they *do not have any security in the first place*. Nothing Peter Todd or anyone else does will change that. Even without replace-by-fee, you can easily get 99% reliable double spending on an unconfirmed transaction today. In fact, on the contrary, replace-by-fee gives victims a way to retaliate against double spending! They can throw the bitcoins away entirely to a transaction fee, making it outbid the double-spend; the victim still loses it, but so does the attacker.
BTW, I've had to yell at at least one of your claimed-conspiring companies for stupidly trying to treat unconfirmed transactions as confirmed. They don't *want* it to "break".

If Coinbase was sending spam, I would react the same way to them. It's not mere "transaction volume" - if SatoshiDice was *actually* generating that much traffic, that'd be fine. But they're abusing Bitcoin transactions as a messaging system - it'd be like walking into Walmart and sending a transaction for every item you look at, then them sending it back if you decide not to buy it.


CPU power, disk space *that can never be freed globally*, bandwidth *that every Bitcoin node must spend at least once*, lost nodes from people who don't want to supply these resources, etc.
If someone was bringing this equivalent real transaction volume, Bitcoin would be at 1.0 already and could probably store the blockchain archive distributed rather than on every node. We'd have sidechains deployed to handle higher volume use as well. Companies would have dedicated miners that didn't pay for electricity, just to keep the network running.


There are lots of gambling sites just like SatoshiDice that aren't implemented as an attack on the network.

Miners provide security for the Bitcoin network. What value would your bitcoins have if anyone could counterfeit them at will?
That being said, "cloud mining" services and large centralised pools actually work *against* Bitcoin's security - so arguably they are "stealing" the subsidy. One solution to this is educating people to not fund these kind of things, and trying to minimise any potential loss of profit they might have by doing so - at least until those running these services find themselves without a business until they implement decentralised mining (SP ASICs and GBT).

The "whole world" uses the SI metric system because it was forced on them by governments. The US uses the non-English "US customary" system because its government didn't force metric on people and gave them a free choice - and the US customary system, which is based on 2s and 3s that humans work somewhat reasonably well with, is rationally *superior* to the SI metric system, which is based on 5s that makes it more difficult to work with.
The reason SI gave for doing this rather than adopting the superior [Tonal]( or at least [Dozenal]( metric systems, was that their government mandate required they use a decimal (5-based) system.
In the meantime, [people can use Bitcoin with tonal]( as well as decimal.

No, this would be a bad idea for a number of reasons, including (at least): 1) P2Pool is just one pool, maintained by one person; miners should be free to use or make other pools; 2) P2Pool itself is vulnerable to 51% attacks (the attacker gets 200% PPS and the victims get ~nothing); 3) A P2Pool miner who performs a 51% attack on Bitcoin still succeeds in doing so.
Note that 51% attacks are by definition not a real problem to the Bitcoin consensus system - basically any attempt to "fix" it is an attack of a minority on the democratic nature of mining, since the 51% attacker *is* the majority.

My main work in this project is to focus on not only completing GBT for decentralised Bitcoin mining (moving the mining authority back to the miners), but also ensuring sidechains can be mined both decentralised or centralised independent from how miners choose to mine Bitcoin or their other sidechains. This means that if your policy server (which is currently tied to the pool, but won't be in the future) doesn't have all the sidechains you want, you just *add* another one. It's inevitable that some policy server(s) will offer a "everychain possible" service.

Draft Plan 'B' can drop the two professional; Unicode already has the capital roman letter B with two vertical strokes through it: U+0042 U+20E6. Any such proposals for a new encoding will be rejected: ["Often a proposed character can be expressed as a sequence of one or more existing Unicode characters. Encoding the proposed character would be a duplicate representation, and is thus not suitable for encoding. (In any event, the proposed character would disappear when normalized.) For example, a g-umlaut character is not suitable for encoding, since it can already be expressed with the sequence &lt;g, combining diaeresis&gt;." (from the Unicode Consortium's 'Submitting Character Proposals, Proposal Guidelines')](

You're ignoring:
1. Ghash.io *owns* probably about all of this hardware (in reality, there are some remote miners using the pool, BUT the last time Ghash.io hit 50%, they *HID* a bunch of their own miners - so it's probably more like 70% now total, and 70% of that Ghash-owned-and-operated)
2. GHash.io *has* performed double spends, and very few people cared. Admittedly, the target was one of the various DDoSs-against-Bitcoin, so there was perhaps below-average sympathy - but I doubt the difference is as relevant as to bring their probably-70% down below 50%.
3. "you need not a pool with 51% but you need an attacker with MORE hashing capacity than ALL OTHER MINING combined" - that's exactly what a pool with 51% is.
4. "This attacker needs to then mine privately (not releasing solved blocks)." - Stratum allows mining pools to (for this purpose) mine privately. I don't think Ghash.io supports GBT, so all their remote miners must be using stratum. But due to point 1, this is irrelevant anyway.
5. As gmaxwell correctly points out, you don't need even 51% to perform double spending attacks. Even 40% gets you a 50/50 chance (which you can just repeat if you fail...). 30% gets you a 10% chance (which again can be repeated).

Addresses do not have balances at all.
Sweeping all the UTXOs controlled by a single EC key do *not* avoid the risk of compromise from address reuse, as every UTXO would be addressed independently and need its own signature. Furthermore, this increases the realtime risk since the transaction would be slow to relay (having more signatures to verify) and someone attempting to double spend it could do so in lots of smaller (and quicker to verify) transactions to get a good chance at it, even without being a miner or taking advantage of miner policies.

This is a very technical question, and I don't believe there's a "user friendly" way to answer it. Basically, the wallet (not account) holds the keys to generally many individual UTXOs ("coins") of varying values. When you want to send bitcoins on the blockchain, it picks UTXOs which combined value more than the amount you want to send (or exactly, in the rare instance that happens). Those are the "inputs" to your transaction, and use somewhere around 60 bytes each (rough estimate). For each recipient of your transaction, plus one for your "change", you have an "output" which are usually approximately 32 bytes each. Finally, there is about 10 bytes or so of transaction headers.

@_date: 2014-06-13 03:23:05
Just a note, p2p is *not* a beneficial property for pools to have. A pool doesn't have to be p2p to be decentralised. p2p just means it's easier to attack, uses more resources, and (so far) has much higher variance.

More people using p2pool doesn't reduce the variance on it.

Both of those are already done ([link to public list, shown to all Gentoo users installing Bitcoin Core]( The only thing I'd wish to improve would be making a GUI for configuring it at runtime - but that takes a lot more effort and decreases the effectiveness (it'd require more CPU time to check, so spam would have a bigger impact on you).

Sounds like he should be corrected on the politics... Bitcoin is far better for taxation than cash has ever been, and I've not heard of any government complaining along those lines. I doubt it scares the government - and hope not - because if it did, there would be a serious risk of them making Bitcoin illegal - which is NOT something Bitcoin would simply survive.
Perhaps more relevant to him personally though: he seems to assume Bitcoins will simply rise in value. He should probably elaborate on the risks of investing at least a little, and explain why he believes Bitcoins will rise (it isn't *inherently* true that it will, it's an opinion that he needs to back up - and so far he's only argued against it with the political talk).

Actually, you can't. Signed messages only proves an address is yours; that is, *for receiving purposes* (which is really the only thing addresses are used for! you never send from an address!). It is quite possible to get a signature for an address "proving" you sent a transaction you never sent!
Technically speaking, at a low level (where addresses don't exist), there's usually an ECDSA key you could create a signature with to prove you signed the transaction, but there is at present no standard way to convey this as a "proof of sender", and there are some real practical issues involved with it (the scriptSigs in question may not use ECDSA keys at all, or the wallet may be shared or controlled by someone other than the sender).

 covers the general topic of reuse.
For recurring payments, there are two possible solutions:
* The payment protocol aims to replace bitcoin addresses entirely, but it is software-interactive.
* Serialised HD wallet public seeds allow the payer to generate an unlimited number of addresses for the recipient, which nobody else knows are related unless they have a copy of the specific public seed in use. However, this is vulnerable to some of the same issues as address reuse (particularly, when the recipient's wallet is compromised/lost/replaced since negotiating the seed).

Technically speaking, this doesn't *actually* block them, just slows them down by refusing to help them. It would only block them if 100% of Bitcoin users chose to run with it enabled.
Actually, I'm not sure what would happen if someone were to try to participate in SatoshiDice's attack, while running this code - it didn't really occur to me that people might do such a thing :(
I agree it definitely needs to be better documented, and improving that situation is already planned (the Gentoo bug is asking for suggestions on language to make it as clear as possible).

Yes, we need to process thousands or more transactions per second. But with that (real) volume-growth will also come the *resources* to handle it. SatoshiDice's fake volume does *not* bring those resources with it.

If you receive more than once, you *must* to use the private key more than once to spend it all. Even if those spends are part of the same transaction, you run the risk that someone has an active node which calculates the private key from the signatures, and then double-spends them with a lot of small (= FASTER relayed) transactions. Just a single one of those getting mined means that your original batch-spend is invalid, and the rest of his double-spends will then succeed.
As for cold storage strategy, the best I can suggest right now is to have a separate computer with Bitcoin Core and encrypted wallet, that never connects to the internet, and only connects to your private LAN (to talk to your own "hot" Bitcoin Core) when you want to spend.

Doubt it. There's never been such an assessment for any other improvement to Bitcoin before. Furthermore, any such attempt to assess such a thing would likely be futile - probably more psychohistory than economics.

The Electrum dev team doesn't seem to understand how Bitcoin works, so I can't recommend using it. (their latest code shows a "balance" for every address, which is a bogus number, and has a "send from" which is more nonsense since transactions don't have "from" addresses).

There are lots of problems with reusing an address. Just because you are ignorant of the risks, and nobody has managed to successfully exploit them against you specifically *yet* does not change that. Many bitcoins have been lost because of address reuse before, and while software has been modified to make it more difficult, it is incredibly naive to assume future exploits of the nature won't ever be found again. Furthermore, this behaviour is unintentional/accidental, and you will have nobody to blame but your own bad practices when you get robbed or sued over it (part of the practical problems are privacy-related, which means some kinds of reuse - if not all - could be seen as violation of consumer privacy laws).
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:39:45
It's by definition unavoidable. If someone *is* the majority, they win. Now, 51% of hashing is obviously only a majority from a PoW perspective - if you want to consider the economic majority (required to rule changes), this majority can change the PoW algorithm to defeat/replace the 51% PoW-majority. But we don't have a better PoW than SHA2 today, and there is no reason to think we will get a better one any time soon. Nor are any of the "PoW replacements" viable. So for the time being, the only solution is to simply *avoid anyone being capable of having 51%*. There is no reason mining pools need to ever take that authority from the miners: decentralised mining is possible even without the overhead of p2p solutions like p2pool - it's even possible to do decentralised mining with the hardware all in a few datacenters with smart property ASIC chips. Unfortunately, there are only a few of us actually working on it. Want to improve the situation fast? Help us!

Nobody has the skills required to prevent compromise entirely, just make it difficult. When the reward for compromising is millions or billions of dollars, potentially difficult to trace, it's almost guaranteed to happen sooner or later (see MtGox for example). In the case of &gt;50% of mining authority, that reward is potentially unbounded.
Ghash.io didn't see any significant dent in use from their double spends, so it seems unlikely any pool would put resources into policing it - they've all seen how nothing happens if you do. Furthermore, it's commonish knowledge at least among anyone who's ever run a pool that *at least half of the miners using it don't even notice when things break in a way that hurts them directly*. When Ghash.io is down, for example, only about 40% of their miners failover to other pools.
Finally, I'm not sure why you're bringing up "an all-out attack by a state actor", but FWIW, there is very low probability Bitcoin would survive such a thing in any meaningful sense today (and no, blackmarket-only is not meaningful).
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:26:10
No, even if you were to address all the malleability in ECDSA itself, you still change the txid when you reissue a transaction. For example, to add higher fees, pay someone else at the same time, or CoinJoin.

51% attacks are by definition unavoidable. If someone is the majority, they win. Now, 51% of hashing is obviously only a majority from a PoW perspective - if you want to consider the economic majority (required to rule changes), this majority can change the PoW algorithm to defeat/replace the 51% PoW-majority. But we don't have a better PoW than SHA2 today, and there is no reason to think we will get a better one any time soon. Nor are any of the "PoW replacements" viable. So for the time being, the only solution is to simply avoid anyone being capable of having 51%. There is no reason mining pools need to ever take that authority from the miners: decentralised mining is possible even without the overhead of p2p solutions like p2pool - it's even possible to do decentralised mining with the hardware all in a few datacenters with smart property ASIC chips. Unfortunately, there are only a few of us actually working on it. Want to improve the situation fast? Help us!

If he can't even get his definitions right, I have little hope for the rest of the PDF... (a wallet is *not* a single ECDSA keypair)
Yep, old news (pre-Heartbleed), all because of his single bad definition. If you reuse addresses, you might be at risk of losing it. We've known this for a long time now... This is the primary way people were losing money from the Android bug a while back (remember that?) - while the poor RNG was inevitably going to make you lose your money, the problem was exasperated by these wallets encouraging address reuse.
Address reuse was never supported, and [it's well-documented that it creates a number of serious problems](
Also, contrary to his claims, Bitcoin Core (and OpenSSL) was never affected by this issue... And Armory does use a random value for k (which he admits), but this is safe (not unsafe as he claims).

No,  Bitcoin's function is not to store value. It is to maintain consensus. Your argument falls apart when you realise the "value of having destroyed bitcoins" doesn't pay all the right people, pays people disproportionately, and most importantly, doesn't cover even a fraction of the cost of having to store it forever.
Unfortunately, most miners neglect their duty to filter spam reliably. In this case, such a filter is not even practical* because you're abusing a send-to-pubkey-hash and lying about the message being a pubkey hash.
\* It's possible with improvements like P2SH^2 that require *every user* to upgrade, but that's not practical.
@_date: 2014-12-16 07:28:58
SPV-based sidechains can be robbed by an 80%* attacker, but otherwise should work basically the same as Bitcoin in that respect. Federated peg sidechains are vulnerable to the functionaries being compromised, and SNARK sidechains should be completely risk-free (when/if SNARKs work).
\* The actual percentage required for a robbery is a parameter of the sidechain - the cost is that the inverse percentage can censor valid redemptions.
A State (or any entity) with 51% couldn't take Silk Road's bitcoins, but they *could* destroy them.
If large mining facilities can achieve the 51% or 80% marker on their own, then yes, the sidechain or Bitcoin effectively requires their support. My main task with Blockstream is to work toward reducing mining centralisation so that large mining facilities can't achieve this level of threat.
Back to "blacklisting"... each and every node necessarily has its own policy for what it will participate in by relaying and mining. That policy cannot be mandated by the protocol (it's necessarily outside the consensus rules), so it must be decided by someone. That decision must and should be made by the individual operating the node - nobody can stop him, and it's his right to decide what he wants to allocate his resources on. Now when his resources are being abused by a clearly identifiable pattern, does it not make sense to stop expending resources when that pattern is observed? Not entirely sure this explanation addresses your concerns (I don't actually see any, just opposition because of unrelated sidechain stuff), but hopefully it helps clarify things.

What FUD have you been reading? There is no "the sidechain", and sidechains in general aren't centralised. If the miners stop mining what you consider Bitcoin, then more "bitcoins" for you... but if the rest of the world is adopting sidechains, then that becomes the real Bitcoin, and you may find people unwilling to accept your bitcoins. That's true of any hardfork, no matter how it's done (sidechain or not), though.
Anyhow, Austin is basically on equal footing with the rest of the team, not "the boss", and neither Blockstream nor sidechains are competitors to Bitcoin.

I do work for Blockstream (though intentionally not as an employee), but I don't see that as putting me in a conflict-of-interest position with any of the listed spam-producers.
I don't agree that accounting for my personal interests in the way implied would be rational - perhaps because of that very real "universally objective truth" you apparently don't believe in. ;)
Blockstream's sidechains certainly do have the *potential* to be spammy - but I'm confident the people working on them won't implement them in that way. If they did, then suddenly I may have a conflict of interest, and I hope someone will call me out on it if I neglect to treat it the same as other spam. But that's an issue for the future, as nothing is working yet in that regard.
As for the difference in the assumed ideal scenario: transactions to/from sidechains represent only the financial movement of the currency, and do not convey any information unnecessary for verification of that movement. Furthermore, if "you" don't care about the sidechains, this additionally reduces the overall data needed, since those bitcoins can be transacted any number of times on the "non-existing to you" sidechain with no increase in the data size needed on the main Bitcoin blockchain.

I'm not sure you want a literal ELI5 - a 5 year old wouldn't have the decimal system so ingrained into their thinking yet ;)
Essentially tonal is an alternative number system to decimal. It's very similar to hexadecimal (it has 8x2 digits), but older, and more mature. While hexadecimal only specifies a form for integer numbers, the tonal system defines pronunciations, units of measure (lengths, weights, etc), a calendar, and more. Some references to check out would be [Wikipedia's page]( and the [original book from 1862]( Tonal is easier to use than decimal in many ways (for unbiased humans; otherwise you may hit a learning curve at first) since it is based on powers of 2 only, as opposed to decimal's 2x5 base.
Tonal Bitcoin expands on the existing Tonal system by replacing Tonal's gold/silver standards (which were never adopted) with Bitcoin (which Tonal users can use without substantial investment or adoption, since it is inherently compatible with "normal" Bitcoin).

The logic I had figured was something like this:
* 1) If the scriptPubKey appears only in one transaction, it is considered confirmed when mined to a user-
defined depth (with a reasonable default).
* 2) As soon as the scriptPubKey is used a second time, only the largest such output mined to some depth is considered confirmed.
* 3) Once the public key implementing the address has been published (eg, in a spend of any UTXO), only the UTXOs spent in that initial transaction publishing it can be considered confirmed, and, if the public key has been used for multiple signatures, only after the spend is mined to some depth.
* 3a) This means that when the scriptPubKey has been used twice, the confirmed received will drop to the spending-coin amount (or 0, if multiple inputs signed by the same key are unconfirmed) as soon as spending begins.
* 3b) Note that beyond the first spend, no further outputs will ever be considered confirmed, since it is impossible to know the spender was in fact the proper recipient for the address.
The remainder of received coins that have been mined to some depth can still be shown as "Possibly received" with an explanation that they are still subject to risk of theft due to address reuse. Unconfirmed transactions would of course be a third number "Unconfirmed received".

*Spammers*, as in the entity/person responsible, can still use Bitcoin just like anyone else. It only identifies the *actual spam* by the scripts (which correlates to addresses) used for that spamming. So, the spammers need to use new addresses for their non-spammy use - which they need to do anyway, or else their spam-system would confuse it with its own spamming. Finally, don't forget that using Bitcoin properly means every single transaction uses a new address - so this is nothing especially unusual in that regard.

For example, let's say the pool issues a job and asks the miner for difficulty 1 matching 01ba4719... the full hash XOR is 01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b.
Now the miner finds a hash matching  01ba471998fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.
He XORs it with the preimage part he knows to get 0000000098fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 and now knows it meets the share target. But he *doesn't* know the rest of the XOR, so he doesn't know if it also meets the block target or not.

You say you're a freelance developer - I sure hope you're working on Bitcoin if you're "investing" this much in it; or at least have read through and fully understand at least a significant portion of the [developer docs](
Bitcoin is an entirely new field of computer science ("distributed consensus"), and very experimental. It has scalability issues nobody has yet even thought of a long-term solution for yet. There isn't a single safe wallet program to be using today either. Most of its value right now is speculative, so there's a lot of potential for a drop.
tl;dr: Holding more than you can afford to lose in bitcoins today, is not a wise thing to do.
Disclaimer: Most of my income lately is in bitcoins, and so I'm probably also somewhere about 90% (maybe more) in bitcoins simply because I refuse to sell at stupidly low prices.

51% trying to include counterfeit coins would inherently make their blocks invalid/hardforked/ignored. You can't prove they knew about a transaction they didn't include though, even if that was a good idea (it isn't, you'll end up with an inherently broken system).

It has in fact caused significant damage. Consider, for example, how many people *do not* run a full node because of the 30 GB blockchain size. That would be 5-10 GB except for all the spam. (this is just one example; there are also other ways it has damaged Bitcoin)

Keep in mind miners are also mining at a loss - these aren't the days where they're making big profits off the at-a-loss pool anymore.

Anyhow, wizkid057 runs the pool nowadays, and he's even more opposed to charging a fee than I was.

The summary is a lie: it's completely optional. It's also not political blacklisting (as implied), just hacky improvements on the usual spam filtering already included mainline since 0.3. Furthermore, not only do the "other core devs" object to including this hack in the reference codebase, but I myself also would oppose any attempt to merge it there - it's a hack, and while it's good for real-world use until a better solution is complete, it isn't appropriate for the reference code.

None. The added value of stealth addresses is to have an address you can reuse for the few use cases where you don't care to know who the sender is. (It also works for reuse with the same sender, but so do HD wallet chains)
@_date: 2014-08-25 15:33:45
It confuses addresses (which don't have balances, and can only be used once) with ECDSA keypairs (a technical detail users should never be exposed to) and wallets (which include many addresses and can therefore receive/send more than 1 transaction). Furthermore, it encourages using Javascript (inherently insecure) for generating private key material - which is likely to produce weak keypairs that can be bruteforced. Finally, it tells users to import a ECDSA private key without also mentioning that this action (in general) is a serious security risk and should not be performed in any ordinary circumstances (probably never at all, for end users).
There is [a specification in BIP 32 that can be used for real paper wallets]( but there are no reasonably end-user-friendly implementations of it yet AFAIK.

Basically the idea is that the wasted space in future mining ASICs will be used to verify that all work requests are signed by the owner's key. The owner will run mining software on his home computer which does nothing but sign work requests (but his hardware can be anywhere). Then, for example, if the datacenter is compromised, the attacker cannot hijack the chips to mine. If the owner wishes to sell the chip, he has to sign a message the chip understands as "change your owner to this new key" (which could be a SPV-verified Bitcoin transaction to allow for an atomic on-blockchain transaction).

1) Privacy: address reuse harms the privacy of not only yourself, but also others - including many not related to the transaction. In some cases, these risks are serious enough that they are likely in violation of reasonable consumer protection laws.
2) Security: Bitcoin does not, at a low level, have any concept of addresses, only individual coins. Address reuse, at this layer, requires producing multiple digital signatures when you spend bitcoins. Multiple situations have been found where more than one digital signature can be used to calculate the private key needed to spend bitcoins. Even if you spend all the bitcoins claimed by this private key at once, it is still possible to double-spend them in theft before they confirm. While the situations for finding the private key from signatures have been fixed, it is not prudent to assume there aren't more such situations yet unknown.
3) Accidental loss: In Bitcoin abstraction, an address is an invoice for a specific payment. Once that payment is made, the receiving party has no reason to retain the data for the address (yes, I'm simplifying technical details slightly) and may discard it. Even if someone does not choose to discard that data, it may have since been lost in an accident or compromised. In any of these situations, any future payments to the same address would go in to a "black hole", and be forever lost through no fault of the recipient.
4) Confusion: users who see addresses reused may incorrectly be led to believe they function similarly to wallets or bank accounts. Often this is manifested in people talking about nonsense like "address balance", "wallet address", "from address", and similar misconceptions that don't actually exist in Bitcoin.
For the sake of making this information more widely available, I've added it to the Bitcoin Wiki where others can elaborate too:

It only appears "bonkers" (at first glance) to someone who is used to the decimal system. But for someone with an open, unprejudiced mind, it isn't so "bonkers". Consider the logic in having the MSB-set digits the inverse of the MSB-clear digits: 10 - 1 = , 10 - 2 = , 10 - 3 = , 10 - 4 = , 10 - 5 = , 10 - 6 = 9, 10 - 7 = , and finally 10 - 8 = 8. It is quite a convenient design for actual use, and I take advantage of this shortcut on a regular basis.

A spam filter reduces the impact of spam for its user; vs a blacklist, which is a list of *people/entities* that are punished.

You have a strange definition of "slow". Even for software in general, the quickest usual release cycle for new major versions of things is 3 years - much slower than Bitcoin's rate of change. Bitcoin is a unique pioneer of the entirely new field of computer science known as "decentralised consensus systems", which has much stricter requirements for changes, and due to the adoption of Bitcoin, much higher risks for mistakes. So, Bitcoin moves faster than normal in an area which is inherently more difficult to move! By 2016 (only a little more than a year away), I expect that Bitcoin will have merged in nearly every useful improvement made in altcoins.
Besides, XCP as an altcoin does not provide any actual funding since it was bootstrapped with a proof-of-burn, destroying the Bitcoins that could have potentially been used to fund it. Even if it had been a funding model like MasterCoin, such a thing inevitably boils down to yet another scamcoin since in the long run, any improvements can/will be adopted by Bitcoin itself and those left holding the scamcoin with no value.

Bitcoin-Qt does not support paper wallets. If you're even *able* to "import" it, your "paper wallet" is not really a paper wallet, and you're probably using low-level key management functions (importprivkey specifically) that are not intended for end users, and most likely will end up losing bitcoins as a result (no matter how good you are with Bitcoin).
If you want a paper wallet, you need to use something like Armory (which actually supports them) instead.

Invdividual keypairs are not really appropriate for cold storage, since they only can represent a single address (which is usable for a single transaction in) and spent in full once.
Bitcoin Core manages its private keys properly, but humans do not. importprivkey exists so other software can manipulate wallet internals, but it's a risk for humans to try micromanaging wallet internals like that.
Unlike Bitcoin Core (at the moment), Armory supports HD wallets, which can be put in (real) paper wallet form and safely handled by users that way.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:38:54
That's not true. Pools can still require specific transactions (which miners can then choose to mine or go elsewhere), and share submissions are not necessarily that much bigger than stratum (where they're already insanely tiny).

The page goes so far as to explicitly endorse this slaughter. This is completely intolerable.
The page on "Separation of Church and State" also is very confused, since without religion there is no such thing as objective morality, and thus the logical conclusion you would have to come to if you truly opposed all legislation with "any religious bias" would include repealing laws against theft, murder, rape, etc.

The transaction fees do not cover the cost of the spam. If you want to increase fees to the point where they do, we're looking at being more expensive than VISA - is that okay? Finally, even if someone is paying *someone else* (the miner) a fee, it does not mean they are entitled to abuse *your* resources, or that *you* need to cooperate with them doing it. This patch is not forced on anyone, so if someone wants to participate in harming Bitcoin, they can disable it.

No, sidechains do not *need* merged mining, although they can (and probably should) take advantage of the benefits it provides - even if you want to experiment with alternatives, you can still MM-enable them so multiple sidechains can use the alternative.
Blockchains are not some simple algorithm with a few variables ("PoW/PoS or average block timing"?). There are a lot of complicated parts involved, including entire scripting language(s), databases, etc - which can all be modified or rewritten in sidechains. So for example, you might have a sidechain where there's a daily lottery everyone is automatically entered into - or another where transactions are always anonymous with tor integrated. And you can opt-in to using any of these different sidechains, no matter how much variation, with the same bitcoins (or altcoins) you use today.

@_date: 2014-10-27 06:43:45
They're right, of course. Using the blockchain is much much less efficient than even a poorly designed centralised payment system (assuming it's built on the same kind of technology): every node needs to download every transaction and every node needs to validate every transaction. This inefficiency is inherent in decentralised consensus. This isn't news; everyone involved in Bitcoin development is well-aware of it.
It's also why we get annoyed when people want to spam the blockchain to store their data because they're too lazy/whatever to do things efficiently/sane - their bloat makes transaction fees more expensive for everyone sooner (think of it like burning Bitcoin's "start-up capital").

Thank you for writing out a reasoned argument. Here is where it is mistaken or I disagree with it:
* I'm not choosing between a lesser of two evils, I am choosing a good that enables users to stop an evil.
* The overall network has always dropped/ignored some transactions since 0.3.
* The criteria used by the reference code to determine which transactions it drops is constantly changing.
* The reference policy code is only intended to be a reference, nothing more.
* Spam filtering is not a form of censorship. It is a necessary housekeeping job that *must* be performed for any finite network (which Bitcoin very much is).
* What would be oligarchical is forcing everyone to use the policy determined by the reference codebase, not enabling each individual user to choose their own policy as I have done.

Don't do this sendmany "trick", it's considered spam and very abusive of both the blockchain and the UTXO set (which cannot be pruned and must be stored by everyone for eternity).
Blocks (not transactions) have 95-byte free-form data that can be used for messages. As a miner, you have to be using the GBT protocol and use --coinbase-sig (BFGMiner opiton) to do this. Also note that in practice, the 95 bytes is usually much smaller, since some space is used for extranonces as well as merged mining.

Bank accounts are not the same thing as addresses (the equivalent analogy is a bitcoin account and/or wallet). Addresses are only used once (ideally) and only ever to receive (never to send).

You already need to generate an ordinary address per player to know whose deposit is whose... so I don't see how it'd be a step backward. This lets you give them a single stealth address they can reuse as many times as they need to, rather than a new ordinary-address per each deposit.
Obviously a stealth address cannot be used prior to you generating it, so you only need to look for payments to it moving forward. Admittedly, it does mean you need to check every stealth address you've ever generated while scanning blocks, though.

Really? When have I said anything negative about Ethereum? I'm looking forward to seeing what they produce, although initially I didn't expect anything "real" to come out of it - BUT now that we see the potential for sidechains, that's changed too.
I also don't believe I've ever spoken ill of Counterparty or their concepts - only technical flaws that they have in the past (unfortunately) seemed to stubbornly stick to rather than fixing because they want more miners to accept 80 byte OP_RETURN before they use it. I explained to them that the standards for using it should come first, and they implemented it; the next step is to get miners and nodes to see them as standard - toward that end I've written code to make the OP_RETURN data size easily configurable, and at the Eligius mining policy meeting we decided to increase Eligius's size to 80 bytes.
So to conclude, I don't see how you can claim I'm anything but supportive of Ethereum and Counterparty...

Take a pizza (or really, anything) and try dividing it into 5 or 10 even slices - see how accurate you get it. Next time, try 12 slices (this is 10 dozenal). Finally, try 16 slices (this is 10 tonal). You'll find tonal (16 slices) to be the easiest and most accurate because your brain works well with 2s, to a limited extend with 3s, and terrible with 5s. This same behaviour makes numbers easier or harder to work with in general, not just pizza or physical objects. The only area where this has been found to not be true is when you're doing raw mathematics on just numbers in a calculator (ie, not your brain) - in which case they all perform about equal.

I don't care if there's an informal word for µBTC, and I don't care to try to stop people from using "bits". I just think "bits" is a lame term that's likely to cause problems/confusion. I'm personally just going to continue to use TBC when possible, and SI-based BTC when not.

There is no "key level" in Bitcoin. At a low level, there are coins which are constantly destroyed and created. At a high level, there are wallets which carry a balance (addresses are only used to receive - usually just once - and do *not* carry a balance). FIFO/LIFO only make sense to apply at a high level (wallet). But it's also theoretically possible to talk about selling/trading the same coin you bought at a specific time; this would seem like a really bad ruling, and affect the fungibility of bitcoins as well as create new problems when combined with coins from other purchases.

@_date: 2014-06-13 07:05:56
It's by definition unavoidable. If someone is the majority, they win. Now, 51% of hashing is obviously only a majority from a PoW perspective - if you want to consider the economic majority (required to rule changes), this majority can change the PoW algorithm to defeat/replace the 51% PoW-majority. But we don't have a better PoW than SHA2 today, and there is no reason to think we will get a better one any time soon. Nor are any of the "PoW replacements" viable. So for the time being, the only solution is to simply avoid anyone being capable of having 51%. There is no reason mining pools need to ever take that authority from the miners: decentralised mining is possible even without the overhead of p2p solutions like p2pool - it's even possible to do decentralised mining with the hardware all in a few datacenters with smart property ASIC chips. Unfortunately, there are only a few of us actually working on it. Want to improve the situation fast? Help us!

2) Bitcoin.org does not recommend wallets, only lists ones that meet a bare minimum criteria. It does not favour hosted wallets over real ones. SWB does not appear to limit its recommendations to merely "hot wallet for quick spending" nor warn users about the high risk of loss.

Criminals use what's available. Furthermore, criminals don't care about laws banning weapons either. All such laws do is take them away from the good, law-abiding citizens - *not* from criminals.
Besides, isn't it sufficient to see the clear statistics that crime increases with more gun regulation? On one extreme, you have cities which require adults to have a firearm with *zero* murders, and on the other extreme, you have places where guns are not allowed to citizens at all with the highest murder rates. In the middle, you have various degrees of gun regulation, and almost always the more restrictive the regulations are, the more violent crime occurs.

"bit" predates computer science, though I agree calling µBTC "bits" is lame for a number of reasons.
However, most of the American units (admittedly, NOT including feet/miles) are much saner than the SI alternatives. For example, liquid measurements use a binary system (1 kenning = 2 peck = 4 gallon = 8 pottle = 0x10 quart = 0x20 pint = 0x40 cup = 0x80 gill = 0x100 jack, etc) and shorter lengths use a dozenal system (1 foot/grafut = 12 inches/zenigrafut = 144 dunigrafut, etc).
SI, on the other hand, is a decimal unit system, which is totally foreign to the human brain (try dividing a pizza into 10 slices next time you get one..).

Even 40% (some would go to 30%!) is a serious security risk to Bitcoin users. Forcing miners to use a single pool is not a very good idea, but there is no reason other mining pools need to ever take mining authority from the miners either: decentralised mining is possible even without the overhead of p2p solutions like p2pool - it's even possible to do decentralised mining with the hardware all in a few datacenters with smart property ASIC chips. Unfortunately, there are only a few of us actually working on it. Want to improve the situation fast? Help us!

"Transaction blacklisting" doesn't mean anything obvious to me. Gentoo users would get improved spam filtering by default, which causes their node to not assist identified spammers. It does not prevent those spammers from using Bitcoin, merely denies them use of the Gentoo user's own resources *specifically* for the spamming (ie, the spammer can do non-spam, and the Gentoo user's node will still assist *that*). It doesn't stop the spam, and it doesn't affect the spammer. It just makes it so *you're* not participating in the spam.

Another idea I've occasionally seen thrown around is probabilistic payments. Instead of paying 0.00001 BTC for &lt;x&gt;, you'd send the merchant a transaction that has a provably 1-in-10000 chance of transferring 0.10 BTC to them (whether it does is not known until they receive it). Then for every 10,000 purchases, one pays the costs for all of them. On the customer side, they only pay for one in every 10,000 of similar purchases. It requires a bit of changing the way people think about money, but in theory it might work.

IsStandard has its limitations, but yes, the builtin spam filtering (which goes beyond just that one function) is constantly being improved. Non-specific improvements are a good fit for mainline, but are generally more complex to write and have a higher false positive rate than matching on known spam scripts.

What a gambling site like SatoshiDICE *should* be doing, as you hinted, is taking a deposit of funds, letting the user play as much as they want - using off-blockchain communications like HTTP to tell the site what they want to do, and get their win/loss results - and then when they're done the site can automatically send whatever balance they have left back.

Mining has been unprofitable for ordinary people for a while. If Bitcoin was going to change, it'd be for them, *not* for industrialised mining. That being said...
1) The transaction fee is already too low, due to the default changing without discussion at the last minute in 0.9 (IIRC). This was a quick fix for a bug, and was accepted into the codebase for that reason. Increasing it is a wise decision for miners, and they really ought not to be using the default policies (whether fees, spam filtering, or anything else) in the first place. Developers (who decide defaults) are not, should not be, and do not want to be, responsible for node/miner policies.
1b) Miners should also keep in mind that they can't single-handedly demand unreasonably high fees simply because they want a bigger piece of the pie. Someone else will mine for lower, and they won't get a fee at all. And if all the miners raise the fees higher than the market considers reasonable, people will eventually change the proof-of-work algorithm and make those miners history.
2) I've been running miners off solar power for a while now, and it's still unprofitable. In any case, renewable energy is only cheaper when you don't have another use for it - like selling it to the electric company. With that in mind, it's likely that renewable energy does not help solve the "problem" at all.
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:01:50


If spamming can't even create a slight delay for minimum fee transactions, I see nothing to be concerned about.
If you want to convince me, show me a graph of block sizes after filtering out all the spam, microtransactions\*, and transactions paying less than the standard minimum fee. I think you'll find the average is around 50-100 kB/block.
(* Note, I don't think we should *prevent* microtransactions, but I do think it's reasonable for them to be *infeasable directly on the blockchain*, at least temporarily)


Then we have the current prevalent problem of spam.

While in ordinary/non-critical circumstances, hardforks need a year or so to be sure of acceptance, we've seen that critical non-controversial changes can successfully be deployed in 2 months.

51% is only needed to perform attacks with 100% success rate. Smaller percentages can do the same attacks with lesser probability ([here's a useful calculator]( For example, 10% is sufficient to reverse a 1-block confirmation with a 20% chance (1 in 5 tries will succeed); 20% gets you that same chance for a 2-blocks confirmation; 40% will give you a 50-50 chance to reverse 6-blocks confirmation.

It requires (and ties up) a dedicated broadband connection to maintain a full node. Which also makes Bitcoin exclusive to city-dwellers, cutting off those of us (myself included) who dislike cities.
Edit: Actually, even in cities, the price of broadband is partly due to overselling, and if a significant portion of people ran a full node using the connection to this extent, it's conceivable that prices might go up or limits get placed on connections to compensate.

Sidechains don't actually prevent them from issuing ethers as an asset/altcoin (on the sidechain) - they could still do that, and have some rule that only ethers are accepted as transaction fees on their side chain to give them value.

I agree with this. However, there is a clear distinction between transactions used for gambling, and non-transactional spam that happens to fund itself through other means (which just happens to be gambling in this case).


Valid, yes. But if every valid transaction were mined, the system could not work, since neither blocks nor the resources available to store them is infinite. "Valid" includes a *lot* of garbage, including transactions that are the entire block size alone and accomplish nothing.


Spam is a moving target, which is why Bitcoin has subjective human judgement in control of spam prevention. Unfortunately, that human element begins to make the wrong decision when offered personal gain at the expense of everyone else, since the incentives are not properly aligned (no solution to align the incentives exists at this time).

This oversimplifies the concept of memory pools in a way that seems to confuse a lot of people. There is no *the* memory pool. There are *memory pools*, one for each node, all unique.and independent. The "local copy" is all there is.


This is conflating transactions being mined with their confirmation. By 20 minutes, it seems you mean 70 minutes instead of 60 (given the standard 6 block confirmation). 70 minute or 6 hours for even *most* transactions are both perfectly fine and expected behaviour for a well-functioning blockchain. The few transactions that need to be sure they get the 60-70 minute confirmation time, can pay an above-average fee to get priority. This is precisely the kind of thing we should *hope* to see before block limits are increased.


Not permanent unless the block size *remains* as-is. The backlog would flush out just fine after the few-weeks-notice hardfork to increase the limit. And that's assuming we wait until the very last minute to schedule it - realistically, it will probably be scheduled when the first signs start showing that we're going to have issues.


Obviously these bugs need to be fixed regardless...


RBF (and CoinJoin, to an extent) is always a better option for the sender to bump fees. CPFP is only needed for the recipient to do it the first time.


The race ends when someone wins it. It doesn't go on forever. It's not like miners are going to see two transactions and decide not to mine either of them because they have the same fee rate...


This gives SPV wallets too much importance/credit.


Lightning is not simple. And if Lightning is not a fix, *then we do not know of any fix*. Increasing the block size is merely a *workaround*.


Was Thomas Edison incompetent because he didn't invent the modern Core i7 CPU? Of course not. Consensus systems and cryptocurrency are incredibly new fields of research, and there are only maybe 50 (optimistically) people worldwide even working on it. Sure, idiotic media would probably report it as something bad, but who seriously pays them any attention?

That depends on what happens in what order. Ideally, we would have Lightning deployed and integrated as a native part of Bitcoin for everyday use, and then block size issues get deferred until probably decades from now. If that doesn't happen, then when blocks start filling with legitimate transactions on a regular basis, we may need to consider increasing it sooner to buy time for Lightning. Everyone will know when this occurs, because it will logically result in transactions paying only the minimum fees to wait until off-peak times to confirm.

Definitely not non-innovative altcoins like Litecoin or Dogecoin that bring nothing new. Altcoins like Monero could have a shot, but I think once Bitcoin integrates their features they will die off.

Not if you think addresses have balances.
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:08:14
There is no official system, and changes are not made by a small group. Consent for things like this should be from every bitcoin holder. Actual implementation of this requires the miners, not developers.
This proposed change is essentially not resisting rape because you're afraid of being hurt more by resisting; it doesn't make the rape suddenly consentual, just (possibly) reduces the damage. Consent for blockchain use is only for transactional data, not data or hash storage.
Furthermore, spamming the blockchain does not provide any real benefits at all. Timestamping can already be done using merged mining. People who want to throw their garbage in the blockchain are just being too lazy to implement a *real* solution (although there are a few who actively know and desire to force people to store the data against their will.. which is even worse).
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:49:02
Coins are not assigned to addresses either. Each coin has a unique serial number and script which decides if another transaction may spend it. When a transaction attempts to spend a coin, it must include a script that satisfies the conditions of the coin's spend script. Usually, the scripts work with ECDSA signature verifications. The balance of a wallet is the sum of all coins it knows how to spend.
An address is merely an opaque, encoded token that tells the sender how to produce a redeem script that the recipient's wallet knows 1) how to spend; 2) what the purpose of the transaction is (who it is from, what it is paying for). But the link is broken as soon as the transaction is received - the resulting coin does not remain in any way associated with the address paid when it was sent.
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:00:15
This doesn't make it any less stupid.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:54:33
Why can they? Because miners have the right to arbitrarily choose what transactions they include. Making a system where miners do not have this right, is not possible (it breaks the consensus system) nor practical (you'd end up with infinite sized blocks, or, if there is a size limit, all blocks containing *only* spam).
Why does it happen in practice? Because when block N is found, the miner needs to validate, calculate, and/or download the transaction data for its proposed block N+1, and miners have two choices in the interim:
* Keep mining on block N, and create a divergent blockchain. This makes the existing block N less secure, and results in a loss for one of the miners.
* Mine on block N+1 without any transactions. If an empty block is found, the blockchain and all transactions already in it become more secure, and the miner gets the 25 BTC subsidy.
So, the ideal behaviour is to mine the empty block N+1 until the new transaction data is calculated and downloaded, then immediately begin mining block N+1 with that data when it is ready.
@_date: 2015-05-04 14:08:58
If some people don't switch, the blockchain forks. As long as nobody double spends, both blockchains will confirm the same transactions eventually, but as people double spend they will begin to diverge permanently.
If only some of the miners switch, each blockchain has less security than before. If all the miners switch, the old blockchain is left with *no security* and old nodes can be easily defrauded by malicious new miners.
@_date: 2015-05-07 06:35:51

Assets like this are inherently centralised, so it really makes no sense to use a decentralised system (you get only the negatives of the decentralised system by doing so). Migrating from one to another should be possible, though - assuming Counterparty has a sane way to identify owners (which it probably doesn't, considering their reaction when Bitcoin developers tried to help them fix their problems in the past..)
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:46:02
The idea is that legitimate transactions can rise above the spam, such that it is *only* spam that is "backlogged". Ideally, miners should permanently block spam so it remains backlogged even if that means non-full blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-23 00:46:09
I think so, but I could be perceived as biased (since I started Eligius originally), so I would encourage other miners to respond here as well.

This thing can't run a node... only 512 MB RAM.
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:37:15
The way spammers are working around the reference filter, is by getting someone else to cover the transaction fee costs to bypass it. As a result, the spam that gets in is usually offering a higher fee than real transactions. It is in miners' self-interest to include the spam in their blocks, despite the harm it does to the rest of the network. Right now, the 1 MB provides a hard limit on this: as things grow, miners will need to choose between continuing to mine spam for immediate profit, vs mining the legitimate transactions so their bitcoins retain value. If the blocks can just grow to 20 MB, they can go ahead and put up to 19 MB of spam for personal gain, and then have 1 MB left for the real transactions.

We saw this with the original soft block size limit. We saw it again the other day when spammed the network. If yet more establishment is needed, we could see it again without spamming if miners adjust the soft limit back downward.


0.8.1 included a hardfork 2 months out from release, to address a *theoretically* critical limitation, and that was with no advance knowledge of the problem it was fixing. In this case, we'd be talking about a *practical* emergency, with code ready to go and tested.

You cannot use segwit until it is activated, or people can just steal your bitcoins.
The only way to force miners to activate segwit are:
1. Just activate it. If nodes enforce segwit, miners must follow suit or lose their blocks as invalid. This would require a new softfork, and be incompatible with current nodes (they would all have a permanent reduction in security).
2. Deploy a user-coordinated softfork to invalidate blocks that do not signal segwit readiness. This would also require a new softfork, but it would also trigger segwit activation on v0.13.1+, so they are fully functional with it. (Such nodes would *temporarily* have a reduction in security.)
(Note that all softforks have a reduction in security to old nodes.)

Double spending *unconfirmed* transactions has always been and always will be easy. Anyone relying on them being secure is just accepting the costs of fraud.
There is no such thing as zero confirmation (yet).
Furthermore, node and miner policies are completely up to nodes to decide. There is no discussion to be had about what people do: each person is free to operate their node with whatever policies they prefer, even if those policies are antisocial. We can discuss what policies are *best* all day long, but that is very subjective and in the end has no effect.
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:04:19


"More than a handful" is not millions of people. What matters is who has physical control over the full node.


This is more theoretical than Lightning or sidechains. The latter both have clear concepts on how they would work, but the former only has some notes that assume a centralised policy-maker and are therefore non-viable for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:17:40
I would say 1 MB blocks make Bitcoin accessible today (and affordable only for maybe the next 5 years or so), 20 MB blocks make it affordable for the next 20 years (but not accessible today), and 1 MB blocks with Lightning make it both accessible and affordable for the foreseeable future.

The same small group of people who have been improving Bitcoin for years. We have done many successful softforks over those years, and there's no reason to worry about a sidechains softfork either - we have all the tools in place to avoid problems. (the incident with 0.8.0 was a *hardfork* caused by things which weren't intended to fork at all, not the same as an *intentional softfork* like P2SH, BIP 34, etc).
If Bitcoin remains as-is, it will simply wither and die as altcoins outcompete it. There is no reason to hold Bitcoin back and "free of innovation". There is no such thing as "innovate on top of it" today (this is basically what sidechains make possible).

Yes, but this is unrelated to addresses and not useful* information unless you know the controlling wallet's private information. So, wallets have balances, but not addresses; and wallets are not visible on the blockchain.
\* eg, it's like XORing every byte of a block; you'll get a deterministic answer every time, but the answer doesn't mean anything useful.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:23:36
By security, I would at the very least want to see deterministic binaries signed by many people, like the 3+ signers Bitcoin Core releases have. TREZOR and other hardware wallets help against system malware, but not so much to prove the wallet itself (in this case, the firmware) isn't tainted. I think the ability to upgrade to a full node is necessary for fraud proofs too - unless you have a better chain, the only way to prove an invalid block is invalid, is to be able to download and validate the entire block yourself.


Why would it be lost? Both parties' wallets should maintain the state, in a form that the timeout can settle.


Does it have a way to automatically respend with a higher fee every X blocks?


Perhaps, but there's also basically no incentive for implementing multisig. And by lifting the limit on the block size, we may end up killing the incentive to implement micropayment channels too. I'm not strictly opposed to lifting the limit early, but I fear it may just mess up things worse.

Actually, it could. Since you can reuse a stealth address, your wallet can just split up any payments on some random/arbitrary boundary and make multiple transactions. The recipient client can then detect they were sent to the same address and recombine them in the UI.

Demurrage is suggested as an alternative to the inflation Bitcoin's main chain uses (but sidechains cannot*). We aren't saying a fee-only sidechain is necessarily a bad idea, or that they all need to use demurrage - only that it's an alternative to inflation.

Compromising the datacenter itself (ie, physically) will get you all of them.


No, this is protection from the datacenter too. If chips only do signed work, the most the datacenter can do is turn it off, they can't use it themselves.


A third-party operated p2pool node puts you in the same position as a pool, and is in fact worse than a centralised pool...

The full node can only know, and only produce a proof, if it *actually has* the invalid chain. Which means the attacker just needs to make an unrelated part of the merkle tree *unknowable*, and now you can't prove it is invalid because you will never have that part of the block. But the SPV node will still accept it because he isn't checking the full block. The only way to mitigate this problem is by making every SPV node capable of being a full node itself.

No, because a good chunk of most blocks is already being filled with spam, which will continue no matter what the block size is. The legitimate transactions have to bid higher than the spam to get in either way.

That's not true. One [recent poll]( showed merely 50% support a block size increase, and 20% want it decreased. While 20% isn't enough to deploy such a softfork today, it is probable that will change once Lightning is deployed and legitimate blockchain usage is reduced by a magnitude or two. At some point, it is likely we will reach an equilibrium where the current bip-blksize proposed limit and the socially accepted block size reduction meet.

Bitcoin Core's reference code has included spam filtering since 0.3.x. Spammers have found ways to workaround it, but not yet to such an extent they have filled blocks consistently.
P.S. Despite 's claim, I am actually not that liberal with my definition of spam.
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:43:29
Miners have no positive say toward a hardfork, but they *do* have veto power in this case: 1 MB blocks are valid 20 MB blocks too, so if miners ignore the 20 MB blocks, they effectively softfork the 20 MB chain to 1 MB.
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:56:56
Spammers have a way to get someone else to pay the transaction fees for them (specifically, social engineer gamblers to do it). Since this is irrational behaviour (or at least, motivated by entertainment and not economics), it can often outbid the legit transactions.
The reason 20 MB blocks could make this worse, is that miners can (continue to) mine *both* the spam *and* the legit transactions for their own personal profit. Whereas more balanced block size limits will eventually force miners to consider whether they want the immediate gratification of higher spam fees, vs the health of Bitcoin (and their own holdings) by mining the real transactions.

This concept is usually called [*smart property*]( and goes back to 1997.


This does not exist in Bitcoin. Addresses do not contain bitcoins, and do not send bitcoins. They *only* receive bitcoins.


Sending bitcoins never proves ownership, only that control of some amount of bitcoins has been transferred to the recipient. Since they don't come from an address, you learn nothing about the previous owner. Signing a message with an address proves you are the person who receives with an address (or have the ability to compromise their funds), but it doesn't prove anything about funds previously sent to that address (in particular, it does not prove they own any UTXO created by a prior receipt at the address).


Uh, bad examples. Regular cryptography is far better than anything blockchain-aware here.


Yes, but the examples require changes to the legal framework.

While it's interesting to know Satoshi's plans in 2010, these should have relatively little relevance to what we do today. They *are* notable because of a few non-developers who are arguing that somehow a block size increase violates Bitcoin's social contract, but not much more beyond that.
Slightly related to the Satoshi-plans: I don't think we are at the point he envisioned yet. Yes, SPV clients exist. But none of them (at least that I have seen) are well-designed, secure, or remotely private. Satoshi's vision, as I understand it, was for Bitcoin Core (as it is now called) to support SPV mode itself, and be able to gradually become a full node in the background. While perhaps it doesn't necessarily need to be Bitcoin Core itself, and maybe doesn't need to turn into a full node over time, it seems quite reasonable to expect at least some SPV node that has the basic usability, security, and privacy down.
I think complexity is a reasonable concern, but I don't think Lightning/Strawpay is as bad as HTML5 in that regard. It doesn't *need* to be practical to implement independently with a small team provided the implementations that eventually exist are properly modular (ie, shared libraries) and free/open source: it remains decentralised this way because anyone can fork it as needed/desired.
The complaint about hubs being harder is a non-issue IMO: the network can work fine with even just a *single* untrusted hub. If a hub loses data, your worst-case scenario is that you need to wait until a timeout and be sure you settle in a timely manner. If it just goes down, you simply wait until it's back online before you can use it again. And since you could use multiple hubs, you can just avoid putting all your eggs in one basket if you're worried about downtime. I'm not sure why Hearn disagrees on this - maybe there is some important difference between Lightning and Strawpay after all?
I don't agree performance is a real concern. A few seconds for a confirmation is much faster than the blockchain's 1 hour. If you want to trust the sender (which is what unconfirmed blockchain transactions amount to), you can do that with any network.
To say "there is no time" is just FUD. We haven't even *started* to see a transaction fee market, or delays for transactions paying a low fee. I actively monitor this by sending all my bitcoin transactions without a fee - to date, every single one of them was mined in the very next block (at least when there was a few minutes between tx broadcast and block finding). Blocks are maybe half full on average, and that is with miners neglecting spam filtering - if they start doing their job, we have even *more* breathing room. I will defer to others to determine how long Lightning would take to implement, but as Hearn pointed out, Strawpay *already exists today*. There is no need to rush anything. If Bitcoin businesses are worried that they will see growth fast enough to close the gap too soon, *they should be putting funding behind development to get these solutions implemented and deployed*.
It might make sense to lift the limit prematurely in case of emergency, but only if people in the ecosystem are going to behave in the interests of the network and not just their own. However, this kind of "we need bigger blocks now" FUD makes me weary about even supporting a premature change to the limits: if we go ahead and do it, are people just going to put off implementing *actually scalable* solutions because they no longer have a need for them? will miners continue to put their immediate interests (high fees) before their job as spam filters because fewer people notice the spam's harm?

No, quite often it's a choice between forwarding Packet A or Packet B, and dropping the other. Without QoS, the choice is taken *randomly*. QoS allows the ISP to choose the packet deemed more important based on flags set in its header. I am happy to have my bulk packets dropped more often in favour of others' high-priority packets, especially if I can take advantage of that for my own high-priority packets.

"Enough" and "majority" are not identical. The only way the 20 MB miners could attack the 1 MB blockchain with a simple majority, would be to temporarily abandon the 20 MB blockchain. Actually doing this would result in the 20 MB blockchain having a lower difficulty than the 1 MB blockchain, thus being vulnerable to counter-attack from the 1 MB miners.
Also, if the 20 MB blockchain effectively locks out full nodes, customers might refuse to use it. If the economic majority loses its customers, it ceases to be the economic majority.

Addresses don't hold bitcoins. If you send 3 transactions to a wallet, that produces 3 UTXOs in that wallet regardless of what address you use. (Although it would be perfectly legit for the wallet to only receive the first UTXO sent to a given address, and ignore the rest.)

First, it shows that no change is necessary: Non-spam feeless transactions continued to confirm just fine, and ones paying a minimum fee confirmed in the immediate next block.
Second, it shows that large amounts of the Bitcoin community are still immature enough to spam the live network, and therefore block size limits are needed to avoid it from getting beyond manageability.

1. BU's theory doesn't really work at all. For a consensus system ("blockchain"), all nodes need to enforce the same rules; they can't all have different block size limits.
2. Aside from that, it could be, but the trolls promoting BU want to force it on everyone and do it the least efficient and practical way possible.

Addresses don't have balances. UTXOs aren't sent to addresses, bitcoins are. A UTXO is a product of that transaction, but it isn't related to the address specifically. The "total combined value of coins created during receipt by the address in question, excluding coins which are spent in transactions unrelated to the address" (what you're calling an "address's balance") is not a useful number for any purpose. No spending *ever* occurs from *any* address, because addresses don't send.

1. "Free transactions" are not well-defined. Miners choose at what point they consider transactions to be "free". They must, too, since the value of bitcoins is volatile.
2. Most spam being mined already pays fees. That's why miners are mining them in the first place (they gain personally, while the network loses).
3. Fees go to the miner mining the block, so the miner can just fabricate N*20 bogus fee-paying (to himself) transactions to mine more "free" ones.

Even if you turn out to be right about the vulgar usage of "consensus"\*, that doesn't change the fact that *technical requirements* of what a hardfork requires is ~100%. Many fields have specialised and specific definitions for words that are ordinarily only a close approximation for the technical term. We need a word for the ~100% required for a hardfork, and the word we've used has always been "consensus".

Most of this spam is at present easily identifiable. Admittedly, the spammers could easily change their patterns if they wanted to, so it isn't a good long-term solution. Hiding the problem doesn't help solve it, however.
So far, the only good long-term solution I have heard, is that if the Lightning network is put to regular use, it enables the legit transactions to afford higher transaction fees than the spam. But this still relies on block size limits not being excessive (or else miners continue to have no incentive to leave out the spam to collect both fees).

No, both "sides" lose. All new mined coins are effectively invalid, and anyone who accepts payment with those coins (ie, anyone who supports one blockchain over the other) "infects" their balance and gradually makes it entirely invalid as well. End result is that many bitcoins are lost, including all transaction fees, and no new coins are mined. Which means miners are no longer reimbursed for their costs, so security drops, until eventually we end up without new blocks being mined at all, and even valid transactions never confirm.

Opinion: Reddit is better to make an altcoin than use Bitcoin for an IPO.
While one could use a decentralised consensus system to manage shares/assets, it inevitably falls back on a central government to enforce these shareholders' rights. Otherwise, the company can just declare shares or trades null and void on a whim. This is why coloured coins only *really* works for smart property, *not* assets in general.
Since the benefits of a decentralised system are moot, we can then take advantage of some improved efficiency by centralising other aspects than merely the enforcement. This is what private daughter-chains (aka side-chains) are designed to be ideally suited for: exchange of shares occurs like any other altcoin, but mining is replaced by the company's stamp of approval (remember, the company can already veto any trades it wants).
Obviously, daughter-chains aren't here today. But a private altcoin is the closest you can get to it right now, and could be upgraded to a private Bitcoin side-chain later on.

1. The spammers shouldn't be included in blocks at all. Until they are truly competing against non-spammers for space, miners have no incentive at all to filter out the spam that is there.
2. Spammers are rate limited by how much they can fool gamblers into subsidising their attack. As Bitcoin grows, the number of gamblers does as well, and the number of gamblers who end up aiding in the spam attacks goes up, making more spam possible.
3. Lightning networks partly solve the spam problem by enabling the legitimate transactions (which are now a sequence of many off-chain transactions) to pay much higher fees than the spammers. But incentives to implement Lightning decrease significantly if the block size is simply increased prematurely.

TXOs are *not* associated with addresses. They are associated with scripts that validate attempts to redeem them. The address is derived from this script, but *only* when receiving - the link doesn't extend to the output created itself.


The private key is just a mechanical part of the wallet. The wallet is not necessarily the same as the sender, nor the owner of the coins controlled by it. The wallet has (potentially*) shown itself capable of signing for any output with the same script, but the sender has not. Furthermore, even if we were to assume the sender had proven this, just because other UTXOs might be controlled by the same private key does not mean they are owned by the same person, nor even that the one spent is owned by the person who it was created during receiving.
\* It's also possible a wallet had a pre-signed transaction under its control, and never the private key itself; this is of very limited use due to limitations in Bitcoin's current blockchain, but it is conceivable it may become more useful with some not-near future soft or hard forks.


What "control-of-an-address model"? If you mean signed messages, those only ever have proven that you *receive* with the given address. There is no way to prove you are the sender of a transaction today (although it is somewhat plausible for someone to come up with a spec for doing so in the future).

Each coin has a specific value assigned. So like a $1 bill and $5 bill are both bills, they have different values. Likewise, a 1 BTC coin and a 5 BTC coin have different values (100000000 and 500000000 respectively).
These "coins" can *only* be spent/consumed - not split, sent, etc. When your wallet wants to send a smaller amount, it must consume/spend the whole coin and have the transaction's outputs create two (or more) smaller coins of combined value less than or equal to the consumed coin's value. Each of these new coins created is unique, not associated to the old spent coin, and have their own serial number and redeem script.


The coin with the original serial number ceases to exist entirely.


Again, addresses do not hold bitcoins. Even if someone sends you 0.5 BTC twice to the same address (which only works by accident - individual addresses are not intended to be used more than once ever), your wallet contains two unrelated* coins valued at 0.5 BTC each.
\* While the coins are themselves unrelated, they can be proved to be controlled by the same wallet using blockchain forensics.

Sadly, I have no way to actually reach most Gentoo bitcoin users or even know how many there are. I set "ljr" as enabled by default because it is IMO the best option for users. I didn't even think of the spam filter specifically until some troll started that Gentoo bug, but frankly, even that is a good thing for people to have until we can deploy a better solution.
Probably the only way to make the most people happy at this point will be to add a BITCOIN_NODE_POLICY setting that can be either "ljr" or "vanilla" (or maybe other options), and insist Gentoo users installing Bitcoin make a decision. Before I can do that, I'm going to have to split up my patch into features vs policy though...

It's a simple fact that BIP17 was better than BIP16, and since then we have had at least a few cases which in hindsight clearly demonstrate this to be true: for example, multisig is limited to 15 keys with BIP16, while BIP17 would have worked up to the original limit of 20.

No, because you both should have a signed transaction with a *significantly earlier timeout* that does the last agreed upon split of the funds...




That *should* be necessary, before we start making larger blocks (regardless of when the hard limit is lifted). I'm not sure why you say it requires CPFP... for the sender, the better solution is to just update the original transaction with less change or more inputs. In any case, CPFP has been live on the network for years now.

No, they would remain connected and simply reject the new chain. They *might* start counter-DoS banning the newer nodes, but the new ones aren't necessarily going to ban them.
You do raise an interesting point though: once all miners move to the new hardforked blockchain, this leaves old nodes *vulnerable to attacks* from "miners" of even relatively low hashrate. The old nodes will continue to accept their &lt;1 MB non-mainchain blocks as valid, and can therefore consider this shorter old-rules blockchain as having 6+ deep confirmation for transactions that nobody else recognises.

The argument against cloud mining is that you're not running the miner yourself, merely collecting the rewards from what is supposed to be helping decentralise the network (whilest you actually make the centralisation worse).
That doesn't apply to mining hardware at all.

Bitcoins are only divisible down to 0.00000001 BTC on the current blockchain. They are infinitely divisible on off-chain or sidechain networks, but the block subsidy is rewarded only on the original blockchain. Thus the divisibility restrictions on that blockchain apply to the subsidy halving, unless a hardfork is done to change that sometime between now and 2140.
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:55:56
Non-upgraded clients would no longer maintain the correct UTXO set, and would need to be upgraded before they continued to function. They wouldn't consider the new blocks valid, but rather merely consider entirely-fabricated empty blocks (that no new node would ever use at any point to any extent) to be valid.
A chain/currency split is also still possible if there is dissent. Soft-hardforks differ from evil-forks in this respect, by providing a simple and straightforward way for anyone who prefers the current rules to choose to opt-out of the hardfork by simply deploying a trivial one-liner softfork of their own. (Not that an evil-fork can prevent a split either - it just might take more effort from those who dissent, and is in that regard hostile.)

Eh, you'd probably want to go with something at least a bit newer...
It might make sense to extend BFGMiner to only enable old devices when/if it sees a possible 51% attack in progress, but unfortunately most of the hardware was designed with an emphasis on time-to-delivery and can't actually be turned off :/

Decentralised cryptocurrencies don't work the same as centralised fiat currencies.

This is something in the p2p protocol, which is the right place for extensions (ignoring the merits/demerits of this one specifically). It doesn't propose changing the Bitcoin protocol itself.

No, Bitcoin mining is something that the owner needs to be able to control perfectly. What happens when your datacenter is compromised? The attacker will suddenly take over every miner located there. The solution to this is *smart property miners* that are controlled remotely from your home computer and won't process unsigned work - problem is, nobody has done the R&amp;D to make these a reality.

Yes, super important. Especially about selecting which node policies to use (which sadly few people do).


No, only if the owner hoped to earn a steady income from it. Having miners that are *not* looking to make income is more ideal, since they're more likely to actually configure the miner.


Not necessarily. There are multiple possibilities for decentralised mining, even today.

1. Blockstream wasn't even working on Lightning until *after* those comments were made.
2. Lightning is not "an alternative", it is the *only* proposed way to scale Bitcoin today. Increasing the block size does *not* improve scaling, just delays the need to do it, at the expense of the network.
3. All of us are *individually* opposed to an immediate change, and have been since long before we started Blockstream.
4. Blockstream's main interest (sidechains) is actually *harder* to be successful, with the 1 MB block limit.

Nodes are not mere providers, they are foremost users. You cannot have a truly secure wallet, without running a full node. SPV helps, but to prevent fraud your client *needs* the ability to upgrade itself to a full node on demand.
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:24:33


I disagree. JVMs are a very large amount of completely impractical-to-audit code. And I fully intend to deterministically build my entire OS when it becomes possible to do so. Even those who just run third-party binaries, should IMO demand that multiple third parties have done so and signed off on all the binaries they run.




I was talking about the scenario where *the hub* lost its data. If both the hub and one of the parties loses their data, you're relying on trust, I agree - but if you lose your wallet data, having the transaction on the blockchain won't help you anyway... at least in the off-chain system, there's a possibility that a non-malicious counterparty can assist you in recovering at least some of your loss.

Voorhees did not create SatoshiDice and is not currently involved in its operation to my knowledge. In any case, libertarian and bitcoin are not synonyms. It's also possible (I think he said it explicitly on occasion) that it is trying to force Bitcoin to fix the spam problem it exploits; however, unfortunately exploiting this kind of problem does not in fact help fix it. Implementing SatoshiDice *correctly* would take less effort than the spam (I'd offer to do it for whoever runs the site now, but unfortunately, I'd have to fear the US government prosecuting me if I wrote gambling software)
Regardless, these are just speculation on motives, which are unrelated to the objective/factual reality of the spam and its funding method.

Some of the miners party to that agreement violated it the very next day afterward, so it's arguably entirely void in the first place.

@_date: 2017-02-05 14:12:48
To function as a decentralised network, Bitcoin today requires a supermajority of economic activity to be received using a full node. However, in reality today, probably well under 10% actually is. Generally the reason people don't use a node comes down to block[chain] size being too large.

It's not particularly simple right now... The easiest way I know of would be:
1. Setup an Electrum *server* in a secure environment *locally* (not hosted) using your full node: 
2. Use Electrum with your local server to initialise your real spending wallet.
3. Setup an Electrum server on your dev environment (*ideally* not hosted either) using your full node there. (It can be the same server as your first one.)
4. Use Electrum with this server to initialise your watch-only wallet: 
(Note I have no idea how Electrum holds up to large wallets and scaling. You may find you need to create new wallets after some time if you do a lot of transactions.)

The important thing is to move your bitcoins to a node and wallet *you* control, after you buy them.
1. Install Bitcoin Core or Knots.
2. Wait for it to sync (can take a day or two the first time).
3. Click "Receive" to get an address.
4. Make a backup of your wallet (File menu).
5. Tell Coinbase to send your bitcoins to that address.

And then when the fraudster convinces them to reverse the transaction, the recipient suddenly finds himself looking at his Bitgold wallet empty without being able to do anything about it.

I could have spent my time and efforts securing all my own funds on my own time, or I could trust Mr. Karpeles to do it for me along with lots of others' funds, with a dedicated budget to invest in security. The problem was that 1) the level of security necessary for Bitcoin banks does not exist, and 2) Mr. Karpeles did not in fact make the investment in security he should have in the first place.
Keep in mind that Mr. Karpeles was, at the time, "one of us" in the small group of people technically competent (by the standards of those days) in Bitcoin's technology. Unlike modern Bitcoin banks which have little to no involvement in Bitcoin development, Mr. Karpeles was at least active in  and similar venues up until he purchased MtGox (at which point his time seemed to disappear quickly).

If we were unable to innovate with Bitcoin, we would probably be starting such an altcoin ourselves... remember sidechains are mainly just a road to make further innovation possible, not a goal in of themselves. Just look at these ideas that have grown over the years of things that could be done, but aren't (yet):

Sidechains makes it possible to take any of these things, implement them, get them properly tested, and finally added to Bitcoin after everyone agrees testing is sufficient. If Bitcoin can't do them, then they are ripe of an altcoin to implement and compete with - and an altcoin with many or all of them might very well prevail over a Bitcoin-that-isn't-allowed-to-innovate.

Probably a few magnitudes before it makes any difference. Take the desired reward and divide by 250 to get the fee-per-kB you'd need. So for miners to get a total of 25+1 BTC, the fees would need to be 0.004 BTC per kB.

Pruned full nodes do not reduce security at all.
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:47:51
1. **Lack of creativity / good ideas:** Smart contracts are pretty limited in what they can usefully do, in general. They can't access any off-chain non-mathematical data without an oracle, and once you have an oracle, you can usually reduce the entire thing to a multisig.
2. **Lack of certainty and testing frameworks:** back when I was more involved with Eligius, there was an idea to have the extra funds (held on behalf of miners below their minimum payout) secured by a multisig of {me AND wizkid} or {(me OR wizkid) AND (2-of-3 other trusted people)}. While implementing this was fairly simple, the resulting script wasn't obviously secure, and there's no way to really test that it is.
3. Advanced smart contracts in Bitcoin require a chain of transactions. Due to the unintended-malleability issue, transaction chains aren't secure from being held hostage. So **segwit is necessary** to secure such smart contracts.

Bitcoin is, at its core, a consensus system - it establishes a global agreed-on state. That consensus only comes *after* blocks have confirmed sufficiently. In other words, until the confirmation, there is no global state, and speed-of-light limitations apply. What your node believes to be the "right transaction" may differ from what every other node does.

Hive would use Lightning behind the scenes, just like it currently uses the flood network and blockchain behind the scenes. Using Lightning, however, it can confirm instantly, and the fee only needs to be paid every so often (not every transaction) for settlements.

No, this is talking about the *maximum* block size. Current blocks average under half a megabyte, and it isn't required for blocks to be a full 20 MB after this proposal (so miners *could* just ignore it, for example).

You should be worried if you are having some big organisation hold your bitcoins for you (Bitstamp, blockchain.info, Coinbase, etc) - they are big targets, and *nobody today* is competent to secure their systems against someone determined to get in.
You should be worried if you store a large amount of value on an inherently insecure operating system that implements backdoors, such as Android, Mac, iOS, or Windows.
You should be worried if you use the same bitcoin address more than once, for any large sum of bitcoin transactions.
You should be worried if you don't have proper backups of your bitcoin wallet.
Bitcoin is unforgiving, so if your bitcoins are compromised, consider them gone forever. Keep a secure, offline (remember to disable Bluetooth, Wifi, etc) Linux system with your "bitcoin savings". Lock it up somewhere safe. Make regular* backups to multiple USB sticks and keep those somewhere else safe that won't be affected if your primary wallet computer gets hit by a natural disaster. Be sure you encrypt those backups *before* copying them to the USB sticks, and ensure you only need a well-memorised passphrase (no shorter than 50 characters - use words!) to recover from them. Test that recovery procedure at least once. Ensure your successor(s) can recover the backups in case you die (eg, give them hints they could use to recover the passphrase - admittedly, I haven't figured out a reliable and secure way to do this yet).
\* Some wallet software supports deterministic key generation and can make a "one time backup" that can recover the entire wallet. This won't recover metadata, like any comments you put on transactions, though. Whether those are important to you or not, is something you need to decide for yourself.

The only way to correct the issue of kidnapping, is to stop it. Nobody has authority to kidnap children, not even the government. That holds true even if you or I disagree with how their parents are raising them.
And for the cases where parents have actually committed a crime, *only* the State has authority to incarcerate anyone.

In theory, this may be true, but in practice, XT's code won't cut it. It only accepts or relays double spends if they meet the local node's policy; so all an attacker needs to do is make his double-spend *not* meet your policy, and your node will happily ignore it. Even if you modify your policy to accept anything, your peers' policies won't relay it to you. If you modify XT's policy to relay double spends regardless of policy, you open up spam/DoS vectors again that the default policy was intended to prevent.

Technically, there is better granularity, but it isn't really of much practical use. Even with 10 minute blocks, we see regular reorganisations; it gets worse with shorter block intervals.

SW has the *potential* to bypass the current block size limit, to make a size increase a softfork rather than a hardfork. It doesn't make actually doing it any easier or more practical. 1 MB is too large today, and that isn't changed by SegWit - but lifting the *limit* early in this case is arguably understandable, since if we *don't* take advantage of the opportunity, we won't get to do it as a softfork at all (it will go back to being a hardfork).

Essentially it comes down to there being a void of any reason people would adopt Litecoin as a currency.
Bitcoin by nature can only provide the same value put into it, so in this "raw" state it functions as nothing more than a pump-and-dump scam as it simply redistributes money from the buyers to the sellers.
The reason Bitcoin *itself* escapes this category is that it is a major technological innovation, bringing something new (trustless currency) that has value to the world.
By being adopted as a currency, Bitcoin can benefit even those who buy into it last.
Litecoin and other scamcoins like it, on the other hand, do *not* bring anything new to the table.
They are just mere clones that retain the pump-and-dump nature of Bitcoin, but without the innovation that makes Bitcoin viable as a currency.
Litecoin specifically made three *irrelevant* changes:
* Change of mining proof-of-work from SHA256d to scrypt. This was done as an attempt to make GPU mining impractical. Not only is that a bad idea (CPU-only mining would put cryptocurrency in the hands of illegal botnets), it also failed. Present-day scammers will try to claim scrypt is ASIC-proof or ASIC-resistant; this is also false and impossible in theory. If anything, scrypt is *more vulnerable* to ASIC mining since it performs poorly on consumer hardware. Finally, some people try to pass scrypt off as a memory-hard proof-of-work; while it is true that the scrypt algorithm itself is a memory-hard *key-strengthening* algorithm, it is not a memory-hard proof-of-work algorithm since it requires just as much memory to verify as it does to find (the key property of proof-of-work algorithms is that the work requires more of &lt;resource&gt; than the verification); Litecoin's scrypt parameters also use so little memory, that it can be performed without memory at all.
* Faster target block time. This is often passed off as "faster confirmation", but in reality it isn't at all. To get the same security as 6 bitcoin blocks confirming a transaction, you need around 24 litecoin blocks (there are a lot of factors involved that weigh into this). In the end, the faster blocks just bloat the blockchain more - and not just the entirety of the blockchain, but the headers-only minimal blockchain that would be used by light clients.
* Larger currency supply. But we all know 1 BTC is divisible to 8 decimal places. There are more mBTC than LTC, so no "silver to gold" is needed in an alternate blockchain.

If there was many people, it'd be crashing the price of Bitcoin, not BU-coin. But only a minority think BU is sane, let alone a good idea, so it's unlikely enough will sell their bitcoins for BU-coins to significantly crash the price.

It could very well involve 51%. Bitcoin isn't supposed to rely on 51% of miners for anything more than double spending, but the situation with light clients relies on them to be honest for almost everything.
But note that any 51% attack can be accomplished with much less than 51% at some risk. 30% can succeed at such 6-block-deep attacks with 13% probability; 40% with a 50/50 chance. Many people accept only 1 block confirmation, and a mere 24% can get a 50/50 shot at that.

Bitcoin is a system of digital currency maintained by a decentralised consensus system in which all users verify every transaction by validating digital signatures. A bitcoin wallet is the key required to produce digital signatures that all users recognise as bitcoins changing hands to another wallet. If anyone acquires a copy of the wallet, they can produce signatures allowing them to sign fraudulent transfers of bitcoins such that the entire network observes the transaction as valid.
"Cashing out" seems unrelated to Bitcoin, it's merely a trade of one asset for another. It could just as well be someone "cashing out" on a bag of apples they stole from a grocery store by selling it at some market.
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:26:48


It's *possible*, but not *practical* to reimplement the same protocol. The state of computer science is too immature for consensus systems, and Bitcoin only works because there is a single implementation (and even then, just barely - see events like [the unintended hardfork in 0.8.0 where Bitcoin Core accidentally broke consensus with older versions]( or [the bug fix in BIP 42 which would have caused a consensus divergence even with the same code on different CPUs]( A reimplementation must be *perfect* or it is fatal to the system. Every single attempt to reimplement the Bitcoin protocol has been found to have consensus-critical bugs, and many have discovered new protocol rules that we had not known existed at the time.


The abstraction has benefits too, not merely overhead. We've actually slowed down parts of Bitcoin Core intentionally (one notable example being the internal miner) to make the code more readable and obviously-correct to developers.

**Technical requirement:** Softforks *technically* require merely &gt;50%.
**Safety requirement:** However, if only 51% enforce it, there is a serious risk that due to poor luck, they could become the minority - so at least 75% is needed. Due to miners negligently mining against headers (of potentially-invalid blocks), however, even 75% is not enough, and we need 95% to be safe.
**Ethical requirement:** Most softforks only introduce optional new features. So ethically, so long as there is sufficient community interest so as to outweight the implementation costs, they're arguably fine. However, segwit not only introduces new features, but also raises the block size limit from 1 MB to 4 MB. Removing the current 1 MB rule would be unethical without widespread agreement. Some hypothetical softforks (such as making currently-used transactions invalid) could potentially require consensus to be ethical.
(Hardforks have similar ethical requirements as softforks; but on the technical and safety level, they require essentially an explicit 100% consent)

I don't know of any 1 MB SegWit proposal.
The draft BIP I made a week ago would have had a hard size limit *and* a hard weight limit of 2x the size limit, keeping the 4:1 ratio but without the extremes only possible with spam. But that's not an alternate SegWit (it gives the same 4:1 to non-segwit txs too) since it only modifies limits, and doesn't add any of the Segwit features itself.

Nobody. The algorithm for inflation is set in stone since 2009 and cannot be changed except by a hardfork which requires the consent of all Bitcoin users who run a full node.
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:24:52
A hardfork is de facto an altcoin with a few particular distinctions:
1. It has a pre-mine equal to the presumed last block of [the current-at-time-of-deployment] Bitcoin;
2. Everyone using Bitcoin switches to the new altcoin; and
3. The new altcoin is called Bitcoin.
Step 1 is easy enough technically. Step 2 is the hard part.
If a significant number of people refuse to (or even accidentally neglect to) switch to the new altcoin, the hardfork fails and doesn't replace Bitcoin (which continues to be used by those who refused/neglected to switch).
In this case, hodlers keep their bitcoins, but also now have an equal quantity of pre-mined altcoins on the new system. They *can* choose to sell their bitcoins or altcoins and buy the other.
Perhaps it would devalue Bitcoin. That seems likely. But markets don't behave predictably enough to say for sure.
@_date: 2017-02-12 01:14:18
Spam is an objective criteria:
1. If everyone who is burdened by it doesn't consent, it is spam.
2. Bitcoin was designed for unrestricted financial transactions, so there is implied consent for that.
3. Therefore, anything other than financial transactions requires the consent of all Bitcoin users, or it is spam.
The system puts miners in the role of applying these principles to determine what is spam and charges them with the responsibility of excluding it from the permanent blockchain. Unfortunately, many current miners neglect this responsibility, and the arms race has in any case made it exceedingly difficult to identify spam anyway. But difficulty identifying it doesn't suddenly make spam equal to legitimate transactions.

If only 25% of miners adopt it, it cannot activate at all. Also, even after activation, miners can *and should* continue to make smaller blocks until such a time that larger ones are safe and/or necessary.

Addresses receive bitcoins, but never send any.

No, they are running an underpowered CPU of a much older design, that happens to use a subset of the instruction set smartphones do. And has never had this core component upgraded in any sense despite much better competing products such as the BeagleBone Black and ODROID.
There are no USB ASICs that do generic hashing, and for good reason: the bandwidth from USB would bottleneck them so they would probably be slower than doing the hash on the main CPU (although the Pi's CPU sucks enough that *maybe* it's an exception here). Furthermore, most of the work for a node are ECDSA signature verifications, *not* hashing.

The blockchain just carries transactions. Wallets have to sum and track their own balances.
The blockchain is linear, it is *not* a database. You cannot efficiently retrieve specific transactions from it, unless you keep your own index.
Today, the ~30 GB blockchain can be synced in under a day with decent PCs. With these same PCs and software, 100 GB would probably take a day or two. With tomorrow's PCs and Bitcoin Core 0.12, maybe back under a day.

You don't get a choice whether to copyright software or not: it's automatic. All of Bitcoin itself is copyrighted. Some third-party Bitcoin software has asserted public domain, but many countries don't recognise the right to explicitly put things under the public domain, so the best solution is to grant non-revocable licenses to the software, such as the MIT license Bitcoin uses.

Normally, stale blocks happen when miners find the same block at nearly the same time. "Nearly the same time" is measured by how long it takes each miner to hear about the others' block - which is probably seconds these days (due to centralised backbones), but could potentially be a minute or so for miners just using the peer-to-peer network. So with shorter block intervals, the overlap time becomes a greater percentage of the block rate.

If this were true, Bitcoin would definitely be a failure in decentralisation.
I am pretty sure it is not true, however. Only 47% of the network is presently running the current version; over 14% are running versions so old they have *known exploits*.


I have not seen evidence of this. BitPay recently disclosed they represent (in a limited capacity) merely ~2% of the Bitcoin economy. Without even knowing *who/what* provides ~98% of the economic activity, how can we begin to speculate on the opinion of that 98%?


Core devs have nothing to threaten except quitting. We cannot change the PoW algorithm - that is a decision that (like a 2 MB HF) also must be made by the economic consensus. **To say there is any risk of a PoW algorithm change, is itself an admission the economy does not agree with the hardfork.**


The 2 MB hard fork *is the only potential problem that would be causing this*. The roadmap that came out of Scaling Bitcoin, that most of the Core developers signed off on, has no such risks whatsoever.
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:46:29
Being a softfork means [non-miner] software can be upgraded at their own pace. If it were a hardfork, everyone would need to upgrade by a deadline or risk becoming vulnerable to attacks or losing access to bitcoins.
The anyone-can-spend just means your old software will *ignore* segwit transactions - it won't accept them itself, since they are never to its non-segwit addresses.
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:51:39
Yes, but it isn't really a softfork as the old nodes cease to function in maintaining the UTXO set. The difference between extension blocks and soft-hardforks, is that the extension block leaves them working with a limited UTXO set, while the soft-hardfork has as a consensus rule not modifying the old UTXO set (that is, the old block must be empty).

@_date: 2015-01-29 19:59:42
It's significantly different from what Satoshi wrote nowadays. Furthermore, the (reference) core code is not necessarily tied to the wallet code, which is quite immature and being entirely rewritten for a future release. Some Core developers will even recommend you *not* use the current wallet (although I won't because the alternatives right now aren't really better).
Calling even the core code "official" is kinda defeating the point of Bitcoin, even though it may be de facto true. Extending that to the wallet code loses the de facto bit.

Signalling is only signalling. While `0x20000002` will be counted toward the activation-triggering 95%, it is only *safe to activate* if 95% of miners are *actually enforcing* the new segwit rules. If you put a financial motive behind the signal, there is a chance some miners may signal *without* enforcing segwit's rules, which makes the signal useless for its technical purpose. If it was safe to deploy with less than 95% of miners enforcing, a lower signalling rate would be accepted for activation in the first place.

When the rest of the block is found to be invalid, miners cannot switch back to the previous block. Maybe a way to do that can be added, but it isn't in there right now AFAIK.

I'm not sure about Comcast's limit, but it's quite common for 4G services to limit to 5 GB/mo.


Segwit only reduces the initial sync usage (with insignificantly reduced security). Note that the concerns against raising the block size *still do apply* with segwit, and miners should therefore soft-cap their blocks below 1 MB even after it is deployed. However, while a hardfork requires consensus, the same is not true of the softfork, so those of us who might be concerned cannot prevent the limit increase via segwit.
Lightning only transmits transactions between a subset of the network in most cases, so blocks will be magnitudes smaller. Probably we'll drop from ~500k blocks (predicted at time of Lightning deployment) to more like 5k.

It would be perfectly valid for a non-shared wallet even if it isn't using CoinJoin, to reject and ignore address reuse, in which case the "refunder" has *literally* burned the funds. In fact, this strong prohibition on address reuse is *necessary* to write a wallet that is completely immune to malleability.
The only answer here is to use BIP 70, or ask the customer for a refund address. But in either case, I would question whether the business ought to be shunned as "no longer accepting Bitcoin", as these are valid Bitcoin payments.
There is no such thing as "undue use of RBF", since the merchant has no idea when RBF is "due". If I go to a supermarket, and stop at a coffee shop on my way home, it is absolutely correct for my wallet software to RBF the supermarket transaction and replace it with one that pays both the supermarket and coffee shop. And it is improper for wallets to ask the user in advance if they plan to do this, so literally *every* transaction from an advanced Bitcoin wallet *should* enable RBF.

The average node can't simply download each block over 10 minutes. It needs to download *and* upload multiple times over well under 30 seconds. Otherwise, the relay time across the network cannot perform sufficiently, and mining is forced to be centralised and exposed to censorship risks. Essentially this means that even 1 MB blocks have an typical node requirement of 2.1 Mbps *upload*, well over what is available in the average city today.
You also need to pay attention to total transfer limits. Typical limits for cellular connections, for example, are 5 GB, which is just barely enough to leech on 1 MB blocks (forget using it for the average node). Some Bitcoin users in Miami (a fairly big city) expressed to me that their nodes were already (with &lt;1 MB blocks) using too much of their bandwidth limit to be comfortable with an increase.

You know I did... [I posted a response a few weeks ago to it which you acknowledged reading.]( Maybe Lightning won't solve all scalability, but it's certainly an improvement that can be done before giving up and increasing the block size.




That's not the point. If we were hardforking tomorrow, I suspect 20 MB blocks would make Bitcoin unusable for me (since I could no longer run a full node, and none of the SPV wallets are mature sufficiently). But the later "when" is, the possibility of running full nodes with blocks expands in the realm of possible block size, both in improvements in internet services (maybe) and efficiency of relaying the blocks.




One of Gavin's commits I glanced at did indeed look like it was potentially the simplest viable change, and well suited for an emergency situation should one arise.

No, a better analogy would be building the greatest race car ever and limiting its gas tank to 50 gallons. Sure, with the current technology, that car may only ever drive so many miles on a single fill - but if you make it run more efficient, you can still get more mileage out of it. In this case, we're never driving at the car's top speed yet anyway, and there are known ways to make it near infinitely more efficient (eg, the Lightning network). So why make the car's gas tank bigger at this point?

I looked into SaruTobi a bit (not much), but concluded that it seems to only be doing a lot of microtransaction volume, and not necessarily spam (unless I'm missing something). Considering that, it would be inappropriate to add it to my spamfilter definitions, and the appropriate route seems to be to convince the developer to implement micropayment channels or off-chain transactions of some sort rather than just doing a blockchain transaction for everything.
(a key factor in my analysis is the assumption that they aren't doing multiple micro-transactions to the same recipient - if they are, that may be the first thing to deal with)

4. Because they use broken wallet software that doesn't include the required fee to avoid getting spamfiltered for low-priority transactions. Most miners would prefer to mine an entirely empty block, than a block containing spam (which a low-priority transaction is a false positive on with the reference code).

1) You're putting your Bitcoin wallet on the USB stick. This contains secret information needed to control bitcoins.
2) Yes, bad idea.
3) don't know/care
4) "actual bitcoins" are entries in a global/public database along with the conditions one must satisfy to consume them.
5) Transactions consume bitcoins (by satisfying their scripts) and produce new ones. There are no personal identifiers.
6) Yes, there could be no solution for a given block. But the risk is not practically a problem.
7) Blocks don't need to be full. Miners necessarily choose what transactions they want to mine.
8) If a transaction is valid, then the scripts have been satisfied to spend the bitcoins consumed. Ownership is a legal concept, and cannot be verified by technological means - only cryptographic control can be (and is, via scripting).

Indeed, it should - and that's the direction we would like to see it go. But that's a lot of code (implementing SPV mode, for example), and it'd be pretty simple to throw a new UI on Electrum (and ignore some of the low-level problems that don't get exposed to the user).
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:25:47
Electrum is pretty terrible UI-wise - to make it worse, it "teaches" users about Bitcoin in ways that are just outright wrong. Bitcoin Core's main shortcoming is the 2 day initial sync, but it's pretty nice UI-wise - better than anything else I've seen, at least.

The "technical debt" incurred by softforks is exaggerated. It would actually probably be *more* "debt" to do a hardfork, as you then need to maintain multiple versions of the parsing code (remember, we *need* to continue to accept the *pre-fork* blocks).
While softforks do degrade the security of unmaintained full nodes to a small degree (they remain more secure than your typical light nodes), hardforks *demolish* their security altogether: following a hardfork, old nodes can be easily deceived to think a fraudulent transaction has 6-block or even deeper confirmation.
So in both these areas, realistically softforks are still superior to hardforks.

Yes, that's how softforks work.

Miners are not special in any way, for a hardfork - if anything, they are a "lower" class in that regard. *Everyone* must upgrade. Miners who don't use the current consensus rules (whether current/old, or new with a community-agreed hardfork) simply cease to be miners.
So to do a hardfork, you must coordinate literally every single Bitcoin user upgrading together to the new *specific* set of rules by a certain deadline.
If we do a block size increase with a hardfork, there is no reason to do it as part of segwit. And a 4 MB block size limit is unlikely to work with current conditions anyway.

@_date: 2015-05-31 20:19:21
Yes. 20 MB blocks cuts off 56k dialup modems. It might be possible to maintain such a node on 5 Mbit, but only just barely: blocks would take 32 seconds to download; longer to upload (5+ minutes *per peer* for my ADSL), so these nodes will probably need to be antisocial and refuse to relay the block. Note the latency here is also pretty crucial to stale block rate, and you'd really need more like 100+ Mbit (or probably 1 Gbit) if you wanted to compete as a miner. Even if you weren't a miner yourself, too many nodes with poor block-latency increases the stale rate for everyone, which means more lost income for miners, and needing to wait longer for a full confirmation. Unless miners all go centralised on peering, which they do - but this is not really something that should be required, or you open up serious censorship opportunities.
@_date: 2016-01-06 19:57:26


Yes. Opt-in RBF is a flag set by the sender's wallet, and is an internal implementation detail of the wallet, not a user-facing decision. Wallets which support using RBF to increase fees, CoinJoin, etc will simply set the flag; and wallets which do not support these advanced enhancements will probably not set the flag.


It's certainly your choice, but it's equivalent to saying you do not accept Bitcoin. And RBF-flagged transactions are not in practice any more likely to be fraud than unflagged ones, so it's frankly not in your rational interests to deny them.


There is no evidence this is true or likely.

When/if the consensus protocol is separated sufficiently from the node plumbing and wallet, maybe that can get a 1.0 mark sooner. But it's pretty likely there will be at least a few significant changes to the protocol before then: CLTV, RCLTV, sidechains, Lightning, maybe block size, etc.
For the overall system, I'd want to see a wallet that is secure, safe, and easy to use. We're not really making significant progress on that front.
In short: Bitcoin isn't ready to transition from *experiment* to *real serious* yet.

Yes, but not with the same things.
A listening full node contributes in these ways that you do not:
* Providing a place for other nodes to connect to (you consume 8 instead).
* Uploading the blockchain to new nodes (headers-first *might* make you contribute to this, but only in the unlikely circumstance that you end up connecting out to an uninitialised node yourself).
However, you still contribute by:
* Relaying new transactions and blocks in the flood network.
* In doing so, applying your own policies on relaying; hopefully you have customised that so it's not merely the policy monoculture we have as a centralisation risk now.
* You are another party who might notice should anything fishy be attempted, and could alert non-fullnode operators of a problem.
Other than this, running a full node helps *yourself* by not making you dependent on trusting someone else with your bitcoin security.
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:38:21
No, using an *untrusted* third party doesn't undermine anything.
Also, while I'm not suggesting sidechains are necessarily a solution to scalability, you *don't* have to store sidechains forever - you can discard them when you're done using them.
@_date: 2015-05-02 18:01:39
Addresses should only ever be used once. Avoid BIP38, "brain wallet", "paper wallet", and such things - they are not sanely designed. If you want cold storage without a hardware wallet or dedicated offline PC, look into HD wallet mnemonics such as used by Armory and Electrum.

4. No, we haven't been filling blocks much yet. I send 99% of my transactions without any fee and they get mined in the next block.
5. Hardforks are not a miner decision. If 80% of miners mine 2 MB blocks against *network-wide* consensus, then their blocks get ignored by the network and the remaining 20% of miners get all the *valid, real-Bitcoin* blocks.

The block would contain 2+ transactions. One would be the transaction to your light wallet, and the other one an invalid transaction. The block is invalid because of the second transaction, but your light wallet will gladly accept it for proof that the first transaction is 1-block confirmed. ("Head-first miners" will happily also make additional blocks on top of that invalid block, which your light client will accept as proof of even more blocks confirmed.) However, full nodes will reject that block in its entirety since it is invalid, and instead wait for and follow another, valid block, which in this case would have a double-spend of that transaction you just accepted as confirmed.

Performance optimisations have been done for "hot" code - particularly the initial blockchain download. But that's quite a bit different from memory optimisations. I'm not sure when/if it will be important to run a full node on low-memory systems. Right now, there are so many "todos" that we can't keep up with (there's not very many of us, come help :) ), that I doubt it will be very soon unless a need is found.
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:40:15
You may be correct. I'm not arguing against your overall point, just pointing out that you're still contributing with such a full node.
@_date: 2015-01-21 02:10:07
I doubt we'll know *all* the downsides of a block size increase until it happens. But at the very least:
* Blockchain may grow faster, resulting in more resources (storage, bandwidth, CPU time) required to run a full node (the number of which is already shrinking, when we need it to grow).
* Miners may be incentivised to make bigger blocks to increase the costs for new miners, resulting in more centralisation as only the established miners remain.
* Miners have more incentive to fill their blocks with fee-paying spam, for their own benefit and at the expense of the rest of the network.
* We delay (perhaps beyond our lifetimes, perhaps not) the free market of transaction fees. Until blocks are full enough that transaction fees form a market, we cannot really even begin to consider the big picture of how the blockchain will need to handle it. In theory, miners could soft-limit their blocks to 1 MB even after a blocksize hardfork, but it may not be in their own interest to do so.
Downsides of a hardfork are simply that all nodes who do not go along with the upgrade are left without a functioning Bitcoin node, and susceptible to fraud (double spending, etc). This means a mandatory update of every node in the wild, which could require hardware upgrades as well. Miners are not in any special position to decide a hardfork, and are at the mercy of the bitcoin users (mainly merchants and exchanges) as far as hardforking goes.

* Your wallet (if wallet is enabled)

Only if the need is automatically detected. Basically what you'd get here is the nearest-realistically-possible equivalent to real SPV mode. But yes, I agree that would be sufficient provided the majority almost-SPVs here could not be cut off from the minority full nodes.


Fraud proofs (which are a defining part of SPV) aren't actually possible, since an attacker can just produce invalid blocks that cannot have proofs made for them. Best we can theoretically do today is as just described (on-demand upgrade-to-full-node-when-someone-claims-a-problem).

No, it wouldn't be feasible. While the straightforward case involves an invalid transaction, it could also be a *withheld* transaction to prevent full nodes from validating it. In that case, ignoring it would mean those nodes move on without marking the transaction's inputs as spent, which then get spent in a later block, and then the original withheld transaction gets revealed.

Instead of miners using the p2p network, they also use a centralised network that gets their block to all the other miners as quickly as physically possible.

Generally, there are two options:

2. Get identity information so that if the transaction is conflicted, you can sue or at least not accept future orders from the same person.

One goal is to have "super-pools" that offer centralised mining of all sidechains by default (like most of today's current bitcoin pools), and miners can choose which sidechains to improve security of further by decentralised-mining them. So for a sidechain creator, you'd want to get the super-pools to include your sidechain (this should be easy). Another possibility to get bootstrapped, would be to run the super-pool yourself and have the miner-used super-pools simply sub-pool yours for your sidechain - at this point it gets automate-able for everyone other than the sidechain developer (but provides the least security, since everyone effectively is trusting the developer).

Because a hardforked segwit would break all current wallets until they upgrade, but the softfork allows people to upgrade when they decide on their own. Additionally, a hardforked segwit would *irrecoverably* break existing locktime'd signed transactions, for which the private key may have been destroyed.

Blocks are at about 40% capacity right now. The only risk of that changing at the halving is if more than half of the mining gets shut off. Considering that miners have known for years that the halving is coming, there is little risk of that.

It's *not* consensus-triggered, which is impossible to write software to detect. Miners are not the only ones that need to upgrade for a hardfork - literally *everyone* does. And at the just-concluded BTC Miami conference, I met other people who were (for good reasons) concerned with *any* increase in block size - so it seems unlikely consensus is going to be reached on this any time soon. (On the other hand, softforks do not require consensus, merely a supermajority of *miner* support.)
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:38:56
While it's not a miner vote, the influence of merchant payment processors is in fact a lot more relevant. Unless all the merchants using BitPay/Coinbase are willing to switch to something else, they can effectively exercise control over the economic majority they serve.

It's easier to get consensus when there is an actual present problem. Scalability is unlikely to become a problem for several years, and if Lightning works possibly decades.

Literally everyone. Most softforks require miners to upgrade in a timely manner, but hypothetically, it is possible to do the segwit softfork such that they can continue to function almost as well as before. In practice, that means they'd become semi-SPV miners, so it's likely segwit will require miners to upgrade and only activate when 95% of them actually have.

In a contentious hardfork, people will lose money because people on old-chain will continue to receive payments that confirm on old-chain, and people on HF-chain will receive payments that confirm on HF-chain. Even without any fraud, as soon as miners on either side spend their newly mined bitcoins, you will have transactions that are valid only on one side or another. Since in the end, only one chain can prevail, whichever group was accepting bitcoins on the losing side will suffer serious losses.
With regard to compromises: I am fine with a HF to bump to 2 MB. But someone else will need to do the hard work of convincing the entire (or close to it) economy to go along with it. To be clear, I am *not* advising people to resist a non-contentious hardfork to 2 MB.

Evidence? The few significant miners left basically made their own chips, which is pretty cheap. A high-end Intel CPU costs about 10 cents to produce per unit, for example.




These are good examples, and I don't expect it to actually be a problem.


The last halving was when miners were switching from GPUs to FPGAs anyway, so it was simply the last straw that took down the remaining GPU miners.

This allows a rogue node to DoS you by claiming *literally everything* is unpublished, forcing you to download it all to verify. Might as well be a full node at that point - and if you can't for technical reasons, you can't verify there's not part missing either.

Fee is entirely irrelevant to what I just said here. But this isn't a matter of mining protocol, but the policies of individual miners.

At a technical level, a softfork *adds* new rules, where a hardfork *removes* (or changes) old rules. In a practical sense, this means that old node software will continue to work (with degraded security) after a softfork, but cease to work entirely (and become very vulnerable to exploits) after a hardfork. This also means that miners can literally *force* a softfork on the rest of the network, but have no relevance when it comes to a hardfork since the "default action" of the economy in such a case is to stay with the previous rules.

Then you must not be looking very hard. There is lots of evidence that even the *current* block sizes are severely damaging decentralisation:
* Full node count and percentage are at an all-time low. If you ask people why they don't run a node, the reason is often tied to the block size.
* Miners are de facto cheating by skipping the very validation that is a crucial part of their job. This breaks the little security light clients had. The cause for this is the time it takes to verify large blocks.
* Mining requires membership in a centralised backbone (Matt's relay network) in order to not take huge losses due to stale rate as large blocks take time to cross the p2p network. Centralised backbones like this are inherently not permissionless, and can be censored.
* Even with the centralised backbone, colluding major pools are de facto performing 51% attacks on the rest of the miners, as an accidental result of the above conditions caused by too-large blocks.

What matters is that *people* are *using* their own nodes for commerce. At the very least, the majority of economic activity *must* be using full nodes of their own, or Bitcoin loses basically all security as a whole. Each individual can only take advantage of Bitcoin's trustless benefits if they use their own full node.
So no, there isn't an absolute node count that is important, and sometimes more nodes can be bad (eg, the same person running multiple nodes they have no use for). But it is important for each person that they use their own node, and important for Bitcoin as a whole that most people do.

In theory, these should just be spends to a script of OP_RETURN. I don't see any use case for disguising it as a payment or address... doing so permanently bloats the UTXO set, and for no reason, so it seems probable to be spam, although it's an an obvious-yes case.

Hardforks require everyone to upgrade at the same time or the network just breaks completely. A softfork segwit allows people to upgrade at their own pace, and doesn't cause any harm if only 99% do it instead of 100%.

0.8.1 included a deliberate hardfork to increase transaction volume.
BIP 42 is an accepted and merged proposal for a future hardfork to limit the total supply of bitcoins (originally, after the initial 21mil were mined, block subsidy went back to 50 BTC and started introduction of another 21mil on top of that, repeated forever).

In other words, the code changes do not do what the description claims they do. It may do everything possible to limit it to 30 seconds on the node end, but as already mentioned this is ineffective with current miners which will refuse to ever switch back to an old block.

I've used Coinbase before, but I wouldn't keep any money there. For merchant stuff, it's always felt weird on the customer side. I think the last time I did it, they made me login to a Coinbase account and pay with my balance (I couldn't just pay with bitcoin). Since I don't keep a balance on Coinbase, that meant I had to deposit first. Which apparently now means I have to wait for the transaction to confirm before I can pay the merchant. In the end, I went back and used the merchant's BitPay option despite the slightly higher price...

Despite all the spamming going on, a trivial transaction I sent paying only a minimum mining fee was still confirmed in the very next block. Admittedly, the one I sent without any fee is still waiting, but it's reasonable to expect no-fee transactions to take at least a day.
(Note this is *not* an endorsement for spamming the *mainnet* even for testing. That's what we have testnet for.)
Edit: The fee-less transaction got mined ~6 hours later. This is very reasonable. I conclude there is no immediate or near future problem.

Already incentivised since day 1 (you get the benefit of not trusting other people with your money). Although possible to *improve* incentives further with Lightning (have new nodes pay old ones to bootstrap off them?).


getblocktemplate addresses the pool centralisation risk - but admittedly it could benefit from being remade since nobody uses the advanced functionality complicating the simpler use. Not much we can do about the hardware centralisation though :(


Bitcoin is governance-resistant as a feature, so adding governance is not a goal. Polling seems to *necessarily* imply more weight to the rich.


I think OpenBazaar is working on this?


There are no good solutions for anonymity yet, but Bitcoin's pseudonymity is pretty good if you use it right (that is, don't reuse addresses).


Bad idea. There is a *lot* of work that goes into Bitcoin development that doesn't materialise as git commits. Peer review especially is very important.


Something I've wanted to add to BFGMiner for a while, is performing SNARK proofs. This would enable the PoW to become literally anything (but with significant overhead in the calculation, necessary to prove it was done correctly). However, SNARKs are not really ready yet, and deploying this PoW change to Bitcoin *might* be a contentious hardfork.

What do you mean "appropriate fee"? Transaction fees neither cover the cost of the data (which is several dollars at least), nor go to the people harmed by spam (users).

1. SegWit is actually better as a softfork than as a hardfork. (Perhaps there's some minor improvement to be made by mixing both the hardfork and softfork designs.)
2. Classic is [apparently adamantly opposed to any hardforks other than their own]( (In their chats, they don't seem open to SegWit either.)
3. Confidential Transactions is controversial because of the bloated sizes and inability to filter spam (eg, the dust rule no longer works).

I'm not sure it makes them spam, but at the very least almost none of the mentioned examples would benefit in any way from using a blockchain. The only exception I saw was car ownership, and that only because the car itself would verify the digital signature. Home ownership etc depend on government enforcement, so it might as well use a more efficient and centralised government database - there's nothing to be gained by trying to make it decentralised, and even if one wanted to do that, they'd need to provide some mechanism by which a court could force a transfer as a result of a lawsuit, which is clearly out-of-bounds for something like Bitcoin.

Ah, I see.
* If 32 MB is too much, it could be limited further be a future softfork.
* It doesn't actually reduce the limit to 300k. (To get that, miners would need to activate it sooner than the soonest possible release supporting it.)


I think we'll actually get Lightning first, which is sufficient for this. :)

Payment tokens are meant to be an upgrade following and building on these improvements (that's partly why my draft was incomplete). These segwit addresses are segwit-specific and still not safe to reuse. Payment tokens on the other hand are meant to be generic and possibly reusable (depending on the wallet generating the address; non-reusable ones are explicit).
@_date: 2016-01-11 15:35:09




Only if current software stops working as it presently does (not counting security reduction from fullnode to semi-SPV). So if you zero-out all the amounts, current wallets would no longer work correctly.
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:15:40
Yes, segwit is a block size increase, and as such poses a risk in *some of* the same ways a hardforked increase would. But that is assuming miners make larger blocks immediately. They *should* continue to limit blocks to 1 MB until some future time when larger becomes safe. If we can't trust them with that, the community should either avoid using segwit transactions (which de facto limits them to produce smaller blocks), or push to deploy a (possibly temporary) block size limit softfork on top of segwit (I can write this, but would prefer to see indication of widespread support first).
@_date: 2017-02-19 12:14:54

It's obviously critical to a UASF that a majority of the users require it at the same time. (BIP 148 works by making the segwit-bit signal mandatory, not be activating segwit directly)

Older nodes are no different from pSPV nodes in this regard: they're not full nodes, and don't store the full blocks.
But for all full nodes which download the full blocks (the only thing that matters in this context), it is undeniably a block size increase.

I'm not sure "relay only" nodes have any value, beyond serving light clients (which means they need to be listening nodes). If every node can accept 100 incoming connections, we need 1 node per 100 light clients - but non-relay-only nodes can also serve them just as well (at least, if they're not pruned).
@_date: 2016-01-09 02:54:21
8 is an approximate number of peers each early node (randomly chosen) needs to relay to in order for reasonable exponential propagation, and 30s is a high-end estimate of what is reasonable for a single hop in that propagation.

The code will be released when it's ready. Right now, that looks more like end of April (but I did suggest BitPay and KnCMiner contribute developers to help get things done faster).
Deployment timeframe is up to the miners. BIP 141 defines that it completes at 95% of the previous 1000 blocks. There is no extra grace period, but it's a softfork, so old software will continue to work after the upgrade.
@_date: 2016-03-02 22:00:43
~2 MB in a month or two, deployed as a softfork.
@_date: 2016-01-09 02:22:50
The witness data, which is not counted by the current 1 MB limit rule, is still a part of the block. So basically pre-SegWit nodes won't see the full block anymore, leaving the post-SegWit nodes free to remove (to an extent) the block size rule themselves.
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:16:03
Bitcoin Core used to do that - it's called accounts. The code is still in there, but deprecated and will likely be removed someday.
@_date: 2017-02-05 19:33:50


Because miners are choosing the transactions they put in their blocks.


Nodes don't make the blocks. We can only enforce a limit to the maximum size, and that must be consistent across all nodes.

This is already the case.


They're not stored outside of blocks, just in a more prunable/skippable manner. It only makes sense that using less resources is cheaper.


Huh? The discount is given *to* miners, in the form of increase block space. Miners can always choose whatever transaction fee structure they want from users.

The statuses are documented in [BIP 1]( The change from Draft to Accepted is mostly decided by the author/champion when he considers the BIP complete, but there is some ambiguous criteria as well. When the community has adopted it, it becomes Final. What precisely consists of adoption is BIP-specific. Softforks generally need a miner supermajority, whereas wallet features would just need widespread implementation in multiple wallets and hardforks would require the entire Bitcoin community to move to the new protocol.


Because its author never suggested changing it to Accepted, and it is not a good idea to use or implement. It might not even be a Draft, except that it somehow bypassed peer review.

Transaction volume, on the other hand, is *actually* only about 400k on average. Blocks are being padded with spam to their max size by negligent miners, and that could very well continue if the limit is increased, so we need to be careful.

Typically an empty block is produced when the miner hasn't had sufficient time to calculate a new transaction-including block yet. During that time, he has 3 options:
1. Turn off the miners. Not always practical, and has no value to him.
2. Mine a stale block and hope for the best. Harmful to the network, though.
3. Mine an empty block. Helps the network, and gets him the block subsidy.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:19:39

Miners' wallets work like any other wallet. When they're trying to find a block, the block they create has the 25+ BTC paid to an address in that wallet.


Well, to produce a valid signature. But for any regular usage, that's going to need a private key.


Conceivable? Technically. Practical? Not in the universe's lifetime.


Your wallet shows transactions that aren't confirmed, broadcast over a peer-to-peer network. Until they show confirmed, however, it is entirely possible that they won't complete.

There is no such thing as a "wallet address". Bitcoin addresses are single-use pointers to a wallet.

@_date: 2016-01-09 02:21:16
At this point, I think it's basically just bandwidth. 1 MB per block means the average node needs to move that 1 MB about 8 times in under 30 seconds, so 2.13 Mbps upload. Many high-end big-city ISPs offer better than that, but most of the world can't handle it today, and improvement only tends toward 30% per year optimistically.

Satoshi's idea for avoiding this, was to have fraud proofs so the full nodes out there could let everyone else know if something fishy was going on in real-time.

Yes... *very* negative effects, in fact:
* Full node count and percentage are at an all-time low. If you ask people why they don't run a node, the reason is often tied to the block size.
* Miners are de facto cheating by skipping the very validation that is a crucial part of their job. This breaks the little security light clients had. The cause for this is the time it takes to verify large blocks.
* Mining requires membership in a centralised backbone (Matt's relay network) in order to not take huge losses due to stale rate as large blocks take time to cross the p2p network. Centralised backbones like this are inherently not permissionless, and can be censored.
* Even with the centralised backbone, colluding major pools are de facto performing 51% attacks on the rest of the miners, as an accidental result of the above conditions caused by too-large blocks.

It would be pretty ironic if miners calling for an increase in block size delayed the same increase in a cleaner way. It seems a lot of the argument for a hardfork is (unsubstantiated) worry that SegWit won't be ready "sooner" - so it makes no sense for them to delay it.

Below 0.0001 BTC/kB, it's considered the same as no fee at all. Some miners have reduced the threshold to 0.00001 BTC/kB, but I'm not sure that is intentional (the default was pseudo-accidentally dropped in 0.9 and 0.10).

Not likely, and even if it had an impact, it's your right to do so.
@_date: 2016-01-09 02:33:51
You have it backward. Either way, most software needs to be updated (not rewritten), but doing it as a softfork allows them to do it at their own pace, while pre-segwit software continues to work. With a hardfork, all software must be upgraded precisely at the same time, and old software will cease to function entirely. So, it's a *much bigger* hassle for every Bitcoin developer (Core and non-Core) to try to pull it off as a hardfork.
Edit: I misread as referring to a SegWit hardfork, and not a simple block size hardfork. [See more](

Because once such a thing becomes possible, there is no longer a need for more than one decentralised node, which has the work done by the miner finding the block. Or rather, what a node does is redefined: instead of verifying the blockchain, you now verify the SNARK proof. Basically what you're asking for is an optimisation that current computers are incapable of today.

Lightning should make these practical at scale for Bitcoin.


1. In the long-term, if Bitcoin is successful, the value of BTC are going to be much higher, and those smaller amounts will be worth more.
2. Even if every transaction had a minimum of (eg) 1 BTC, you could still use all 8 digits. For example, 1.23456789 BTC isn't a small value, but very precise. (Note that you already can't send amounts as small as 0.0000001 BTC.)

The harm to the network from ongoing spam attacks is severe. Fewer than 25% of bitcoin holders are Bitcoin users (ie, with their own full node); typically the reason given is related to the block size (eg, slow sync, high bandwidth usage, high CPU usage, etc).
We could easily drop to at least 750k block sizes by temporarily delaying some less efficient (albeit legitimate) uses of the blockchain to low-traffic periods.  Even without any loss or delays, 750k-850k blocks should be practical. And once Lightning is ready, probably at least as low as 100k without compromising *any* legitimate use cases.

Those "extra bytes" are needed even if it wasn't segwit. Notice the second input (the segwit one) has a null scriptSig. If you get rid of the witness data, that data needs to be put in the scriptSig instead or you'd end up with a *normal* anyone-can-spend. So the non-segwit equivalent of that transaction is:
There's a total of 4 bytes difference, two of which are the "segwit signature" (and can therefore simply be skipped/omitted when storing if you like), and the other two are the sizes of each witness vector - which can also be skipped if you want to be fancy. But it's just 4 bytes, and people are more concerned with time to deploy than spending more time optimising them out.

Extension blocks and soft-hardforks seem to fall within the scope of what your article was discussing, however, but are not really covered by your table therein since they behave in many ways similar to a softfork, while delivering basically the same things as other hardforks (to a lesser extent with ext. blocks).

It doesn't work fine at 1 MB. Today, less than 10% of bitcoin users are Bitcoin users (ie, run and use their own full node rather than just trusting someone else). This situation puts the entire network's security in jeopardy.
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:16:03
It's important for *you* because without your own full node, you're just *blindly trusting* someone else's... without one, you don't get the benefits Bitcoin has to offer. It's not secure; it's not trustless; etc. You can never be sure you received a payment or have any bitcoins.
It's important *to the network* because if too few people run their own node, it allows and creates an incentive for miners to change any of the rules basically at whim. It's BU, but worse: they can create unlimited inflation, steal anyone's bitcoins, etc all without being detected. Perhaps a minority of full nodes might detect it, but by the time they get the word out manually\*, it may be too late if most of the economy financially depends on those invalid blocks. A likely outcome of only a minority using full nodes, is that what the majority considers "Bitcoin" ceases to be anything other than "whatever the miners decide" - centralised banking all over again.

Currently, Bitcoin transaction ids (including the serial numbers for coins they create) are based on hashing the entire transaction's data. Because part of the transaction can be changed by literally anyone, they can also change the transaction id under people unexpectedly. By changing the coins' serial numbers, they also "break" pre-signed spends of those coins. This is called the [unintended] malleability problem (not to be confused with malleability *in general*, which includes *intentional* changes by the sender/signer).
Segwit fixes this by skipping over signatures when generating the transaction id.
One side effect of this is that obsolete nodes can no longer *see* the signatures at all. As such, they fail to enforce the size limit correctly on new blocks, and this creates an opportunity to increase the block size limit, provided the new limit is carefully designed.
Because spending coins currently costs 4x as much as creating them, and the spending actually has lower expense for nodes, Segwit was designed to weigh signature data as only 1/4 of the normal limit. This enables block sizes up to 4 MB (but realistically more like 2-3 MB because you can't make sane blocks with *only* signature data).
Segwit also fixes a bug where transactions take more than linear time to validate as they get larger.
BU is a fundamental redesign of the system Bitcoin currently uses. Since it is highly controversial, it would effectively be a new altcoin beginning with Bitcoin's balances as a pre-mine.
The idea is that you basically have two sets of rules.
The first set (customised by yourself) are rules on what blocks you will subjectively accept as a valid block immediately. If a block meets that criteria, you consider it valid. If it doesn't, you mark it as "tentatively invalid" status. But you still watch the most-work chain, even if it's "tentatively invalid". If that chain remains the most-work chain for N blocks more than the "tentatively invalid" block, you accept that block despite it violating your own rules, and move on as if it were valid.
The second set of rules are the "real" hard-and-fast rules. If a block violates those rules, you don't even consider it tentatively valid, and you reject it completely like Bitcoin does right now. Under no circumstances will you ever accept a chain using this block, no matter how much better the work it has. (These hard-and-fast rules are inherently necessary, because you might not be capable of even parsing a sufficiently modified block.)
BU simply lifts the block size limit in the second set of rules to an absurdly high amount, and users must trust miners collectively not to make nor accept blocks which are too big.
Most experts, myself included, consider BU to be reckless, broken, and/or inherently centralising (PayPal 2.0).

@_date: 2017-03-28 12:17:18
**Blocks are too large right now:**
* Full node percentage is at an all-time low, far under a safe percentage of 85%. If you ask people why they don't run a node, the reason is often tied to the block size.
* Miners are de facto cheating by skipping the very validation that is a crucial part of their job. This breaks the little security light clients had. The cause for this is the time it takes to verify large blocks.
* Mining requires membership in a centralised backbone (relay networks) in order to not take huge losses due to stale rate as large blocks take time to cross the p2p network. Centralised backbones like this are inherently not permissionless, and can be censored.
Despite this, **Core developers have conceded all possible block size increase compromises.** The soft limit default was raised prematurely, and now even segwit is proposed with a block size increase to 2-3 MB. Further increases are beyond the control of developers and miners, and require consent from the entire community.
**No block size increase is needed now.** All legitimate uses of the blockchain currently amount to approximately 750k/block average. If inefficient and microtransaction usage is put aside, likely below 500k would be sufficient.
**No block size increase is likely to be needed in the near future.** Before we reach the point that 1 MB is insufficient, we are likely to have the Lightning protocol working in production. This improves efficiency of blockchain usage by magnitudes, possibly reducing 1 MB block usage to ~10k.
Personally, **I expect that another block size increase will be necessary eventually.** But that's several years (decades perhaps) away, and hopefully the problems outlined in the first paragraph will resolve themselves by then.
At the end of the day, **the decision for hardforks is made by the community as a whole**, and no niche group (whether that be developers, miners, or anyone else) can force it on the network. Most of the community has rejected bigblocker hardfork proposals, and even a recent minimal increase proposal by myself (set 7 years into the future) saw significant opposition. **Polls show that at this time, no block size hardfork is acceptable.** Hopefully this will change in the future, at least when we begin to need it.
While [much R&amp;D has been done]( (mostly by the Core team) toward such a future hardfork, **today, hardforks are not safe.** GIven a few years more on this research, it should be possible to make an *uncontroversial* hardfork equally as safe as a softfork. (Perhaps this will improve community acceptance of a hardfork.)
Note: Bitcoin Core is an open source project with many independent people working on it. There is no formal/organized development team, only contributors. As such, while I think most developers would agree with at least most of the facts and opinions presented here, **I speak only for myself.**

No, the whitepaper doesn't go into *any* details on the actual Bitcoin protocol, just gives a high-level overview of it. People who wanted to learn how it works in depth were supposed to read the source code for v0.1 (or whatever the latest version was at the time).
v0.1 also did not have a *size* limit, but it did have an implicit *database lock* limit (similar in some ways to segwit's weight limit), which effectively prevented blocks from growing larger than 500-750k (similar to segwit's effective max of 2-3 MB). However, the lock limit was largely not understood, and even inconsistent between nodes, so it was eventually replaced by the 1 MB size limit in a hardfork deployed with Core v0.8.1.

There is no "part of the block that houses transactions". SegWit basically just makes minor changes to the transaction format that allows them to be stripped of signatures. The signatures are presently part of the block, and remain part of the block after segwit - but nodes which don't care about them are given the option to skip downloading them. Because old nodes are among those which don't care about them (since they don't understand the segwit format), they only enforce the block size rule against the stripped block, and this allows new (segwit-aware) blocks to choose a new limit for the total block size.


The difference is that the softfork doesn't leave dissenters outliers insecure and broken, but merely not reaping the benefits. Those who upgrade get to use the increased block size, while those who don't are limited to the original 1 MB of space.

It's not ideal, which is why full nodes should be maintained and kept updated - but it's also much better than the hardfork case where the node fails and becomes *completely* vulnerable by accepting *only* invalid (according to the new rules) blocks.


If the user isn't maintaining their node, it seems unlikely they will notice a warning. But no, whether or not they are warned would depend on the nature of the hardfork. With any structural hardfork, the blocks would fail to parse at the p2p level and I think not trigger a warning. On the other hand, softforks will always warn outdated nodes.

You're right that there was a theoretical problem with consensus prior to the hardfork (which is partly why the hardfork was *necessary*), but the protocol changes in 0.8.1 were definitely still a hardfork.

Actual user transactions have an actual purpose that fits with what the data is supposed to be, whereas spam/DDoS is just data bloat for no purpose (or other purposes than the data is supposed to be for, at least).

He didn't set a block size limit in the beginning. That was a defect that was perceived to enable miners to spam, so an explicit 1 MB limit was added. However, Bitcoin also had an additional "lock limit" rule that Satoshi was not aware of at the time, which proved to make the effective block size limit even lower than 1 MB. A hardfork\* in 2013 May removed these lock limits, making 1 MB blocks possible on Bitcoin for the first time ever. What Satoshi also didn't know, was that block size had a non-linear problem with growth, and that even 1 MB blocks would actually be severely harmful to the network back then. Since that time, Bitcoin Core has made many performance improvements making 1 MB blocks bearable, and is now looking to increase the hard limit.
\* There is some debate over whether this change was in fact a hardfork.


Satoshi originally planned for Bitcoin to be tiered into full nodes (which also mined) and SPV nodes which relied on full nodes to provide them with proof of network behaviours. The latter turned out to be impossible, leaving only full nodes as the only way to securely use Bitcoin. As a result, block size increases must be made more conservatively.
But aside from that, Satoshi did not give a specific plan to lift the limit. It is not a given that he would support doing so today, or would prefer to wait. In any case, Core has taken action toward increasing the block size limit to 2-4 MB with the latest Segwit proposal, and this change is now simply waiting on miners to activate it.




Unless every node upgrades, hardforks fail and become an altcoin. Nobody can be forced to upgrade against their will. So to successfully hardfork, it must be shown that the plan has consent from the entire community, and that all nodes are prepared to upgrade in the proposed timeframe.
To date, all hardforks (since the one in 2013 May) have been vocally opposed by a majority of the community, and are therefore not possible.


Lightning uses on-chain smart contracts to guarantee the instant confirmation of otherwise-unconfirmed transactions. Because these transactions are guaranteed before they are mined, mining of them can be deferred indefinitely, as long as both parties are honest (if one party is dishonest, the blockchain is used to resolve the dispute perfectly). Secure routing between users is possible to enable only a small number of on-chain smart contracts to enable trading with the entire network of Lightning users.


Who knows. Incompetence or malice?


I don't understand what a "roof" divergence is.


BU never tried talking to or negotiating with us. They just went off on their own from the start.


Ask BU. They'll give you some nonsense answer that doesn't actually reflect reality.


For a real hardfork, everyone just needs to upgrade their node.
For a failed hardfork, everyone just needs to use the full node of the network they want to be on. If they want to use both networks, things get complicated.


There's no comparable hardfork ever before, so nobody can know. (May 2013 was part of a resolution of a consensus failure crisis, so quite different from anything proposed now.)

Bitcoin was designed for moving value (bitcoins specifically) between people. It wasn't designed for messaging, storing your backups, etc. Everyone using Bitcoin has implicitly consented to the former, but not everyone to the latter.
Therefore, spam is any data that isn't used for transferring value from one entity to another. Sending bitcoins to someone is clearly legit, no matter who the two people are. Grey areas exist for things like assets (Counterparty). Uploading backups to the blockchain are very obviously spam.

Preferably once the economic supermajority states unambiguously that:

3. Any dissenting minority is to be ignored and forced to follow suit. (note: by definition, this must be *possible* or else you don't have an economic supermajority)

That number controls the default for the `-blockmaxsize` parameter, which miners all override anyway, and has a maximum of 1 MB, so increasing the default would basically do nothing. Blocks wouldn't be any larger.

False. Some miners *still* use and want it. And Bitfury's recent experiments reveal they really want to be using it too.


At the very least, "greatly" is completely wrong. The difference is almost non-existent.


There's no significant technical debt to the mining support.
The only real reason(s) for its removal is to either force miners who want priority-mining to stop using it (frankly an abuse of Core's popularity), or to hardcode policy into critical code and make actual policy customization even harder than it already is.

SPV is a concept where the node downloads only parts of the block and expects other nodes to use proofs to tell it about violations. This way, as long as it has an uncensored connection to at least one honest node, SPV nodes enforce *all* the rules of the system just like the full nodes producing the invalid-block proofs for them. So, any hardfork would affect these just as much as full nodes: they will get a fraud proof showing the block is invalid (because it uses new rules violating the old ones), and confirm for themselves that it is indeed invalid.


Yes, even if 100% of miners upgrade in a hardfork, old nodes still lose their security because nobody is mining on their blockchain anymore. An attacker can then just take his time to build a fake chain that they accept as valid.


If they're paying attention. But if that were the case, they would have explicitly consented to the hardfork and upgraded already. Old nodes are therefore systems which don't have active operators paying attention, such as might be embedded in a standalone digital-item vending machine that hasn't maintained a service contract.
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:47:54


Perhaps, but we should be aiming to *solve* this problem (lack of full node usage), not make it worse. Also note that blocks are not presently 1 MB, so it is quite practical for actual transfer usage to be more around 2-3 GB/mo, within the limits of such services. Indeed, I recently became aware of an Android wallet which does in fact support running Bitcoin Core and compatible alternatives as a pruned full node.


Without a full node, you are not actually using or reaping the benefits of Bitcoin. You are trusting an (often anonymous) third-party, much like typical fiat banking. So the benefit of running a full node is all the benefits of using Bitcoin: decentralisation, trustless, irreversible, etc.
Furthermore, if the economic majority fail to use full nodes, they are effectively "hard forking" Bitcoin to a completely rule-less system, and the longest mined blockchain, valid or not, becomes Bitcoin. This enables miners to perform at their option things such as infinite inflation, bitcoin seizure, etc.
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:40:33

That is not what said.
It is quite possible that Core could one day cease to support the longest valid chain, or that there could be consensus to change the definition of "valid" that Core does not adopt.

I don't see any progress here. Back to sizefp &amp; PoW change work.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:13:08
Just an idea, but do you think a one-time multisig checkpoint for the last SHA2 block would be acceptable? It would greatly simplify things. (We could have as many signing parties as we want or need for consensus...)
Note that unlike Zcash's initial setup, this would *only* decide PoW change stuff, not allow counterfeiting or any rule violations.
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:01:28
Right. But if you run a UASF fork, that's not Core, and you're vulnerable unless ec. majority also runs it.
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:53:12


I don't think so, but it depends on miner policies. The reason they wouldn't likely have, is that policies ideally take into consideration other spam heuristics such as the age of coins being spent. So the spammer would need a supply of aged coins to have a detrimental effect.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:07:29
Because I pay attention to the community.
Your linked poll appears to be based on a false premise: "All items in the survey, where the blockize is larger than 1 MB, require a hardfork." (Segwit delivers 2-3 MB block size without a HF.) Even still, it shows 76% opposed to any HF.
My own poll showed 10% opposed to any block size HF ever.
Even 1% opposed is enough to veto a hardfork.

Why not? It *is* a normal transaction. "Normal" transactions can be double-spent in fraud just as easily as RBF transactions. The difference is that RBF makes *legitimate* double spending easier.

The prayers were only in a tiny space (&lt;100 bytes) specifically defined for such a purpose from the beginning, and just as reasonable as any other data for the testing I used them for (namecoin merged mining code). They were not hidden in data meant for transactions, and are not in any way comparable to blockchain spam.

If ~100% agreement is impossible, then hardforks are impossible. It's a technical requirement of hardforks, not an artificial rule that can just be changed.

@_date: 2016-01-18 05:54:14
On the other hand, if people don't use the hardfork, lots of people lose serious money... So while the best case scenarios are the same (2 MB), the worst case scenario are worlds apart (segwit=we need Lightning sooner and fees maybe higher in the interim; HF=lots of people lose serious bitcoins). Also, the HF failure scenario is boolean: unless *everyone* uses it, the worst case happens. With segwit, we have *degrees* of adoption and results - if 10% don't use it, that's only a 10% loss as opposed to a catastrophic loss with HF.
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:22:51

Well, he's wrong (if I had to guess, I'd say he probably forgot at least the 0.8.1 hardfork).
* 0.8.1 included a hardfork to increase transaction volume (details are complicated).
* 0.9.3 included a hardfork to limit the total bitcoins ever to just under 21 million (it was formerly infinite due to a bug).

Usually this indicates faulty hardware. In that case, you don't want to keep funds on the PC, even if you can get around the crash, since faulty hardware puts those funds at risk.

"Troublesome", even if true, doesn't make something a hardfork. Neither does a chain split. But your application to Segwit is just FUD - no such problems exist.
Almost every previous softfork *required* miners to upgrade. Segwit is one of the first that *doesn't*.

"How many" implies that absolute count is relevant. It isn't. What matters is percentage of the economy. The answer is, below maybe 75% of the economic activity using full nodes, the security of the system is at risk.

The blockchain is inherently expensive. Lightning is a serious solution to make fees cheaper, though.
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:10:32
Bitcoin isn't inflation-proof or even -resistant if only a minority run full nodes. Partly because it takes time for a minority to inform the majority through manual mechanisms that the rules have been broken, and by then it is likely to be too late for the minority - they may depend on the rules-broken version.
The current situation is basically as close to an immediate eminent emergency as we can get, without it being too late.
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:47:07
Sure, it's possible. But it would need to be at least 75% or so, and Segwit isn't getting that much miner support right now either. There's also the UASF idea, which is unclear on the outcome.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:32:17
Sorry, is a confirmed troll, so I don't really take him seriously.
Basically an attacker would have to take down all the miners, and if that happens the blocks won't get out at all to cause a split either.

The current protocol is defined by the consensus code used by Core, Knots, Satoshi RBF, Bitcoin "addrindex", and similar compatible full node software. It includes, among many other protocol rules, a 1 MB maximum block size limit.
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:05:21
Compromises made by Core developers, yielding premature block size increases:
* The soft block size was successfully increased to 750kB.
* BIPs 103 and 105 were proposed, but rejected by the community.
* Segwit was proposed with a one-time bump to 2-3 MB (the bigblocker goal at the time), and met with wide support (sufficient since it's just a softfork), but miners have thus far failed to deploy it.
* A long-term block size increase BIP was recently proposed by myself, and still rejected immediately by the community.
Once they got segwit with 2 MB blocks conceded (their full goal at the time - no compromise on their end!), however, they began demanding "unlimited" blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:34:36
I'm asking why they need to get bigger *at all*. As things stand right now, there is no need in the near future.

@_date: 2017-03-30 13:48:20
Sure, but a timebomb basically makes any hardfork with sufficient lead time into a de facto SHF. That could greatly simplify things, and allow for hardforks that can't be made as a SHF.

No, because they only support old and less-secure addresses. Furthermore, the "sent to another address" alone is sufficient to trigger spamming. (Even if the vote isn't being recorded on-chain, the purpose of that transfer would be to vote, not to transfer bitcoins.)


Correct. It's a small probability, but an argument people often make to not placing votes with such polling systems already.
If you're looking for a solution to this problem, I suggest that instead, something like "contract-hash" be used so that your own addresses provably commit to a *different* key, and then that is used for the signed message.
@_date: 2017-03-02 10:03:04

Space has never been the bottleneck. Bandwidth and CPU/optimisation are (which gives about 18%/year improvement). Furthermore, it's not handling the individual blocks that are most crucial, but the initial sync of the entire history - where blocks are merely a delta.

@_date: 2017-03-20 20:20:41
Compromise is not something developers can do. Hardforks require the consent of the community, *PERIOD*. We cannot force them any more than BU trolls or miners can.
In terms of reaching out to the mining community to try to help them understand the situation, we already tried that, and they still insist on shooting themselves in their foot. At this point, I'm content with letting them do just that.

He's using ambiguous enough terminology one could argue he's not wrong, but giving an implied false conclusion. I helped one early scamcoin die very shortly after its launch, by participating in mining it in a perfectly fair manner, and without performing any actual attacks.
The pump-and-dumpers were unable to use it for scamming because I personally had the majority hashrate, raising difficulty for the network quickly; and I also only processed transactions paying a very high transaction fee due to the scamcoin's low value - ie, not subsidizing their attempts to move their few scamcoins into an exchange (I don't think any of them ever figured out that a higher fee would help.)

Not really related to segwit, but it's important people not only run a node of their own, but *use* it to receive their transactions. If wallets don't make it easy to use your own specific node exclusively, that should be considered a bug and reported.
Surprisingly few people realise this. :x

Who knows. Price is never predictable. Making sure everyone knows Bitcoin won't be affected technologically might help reduce the risk of a drop, though.


They could disappear at any time, with or without BU nonsense. The technology needed to secure large stashes of bitcoins doesn't really exist yet. Coinbase in the past has switched currencies out from under customers, so there's a risk of that, although in the end I hear they made good on returning the original deposits of the original currency.

The miners don't make the decisions, the community does. And segwit de facto has widespread support, even today.
Miners merely provide a service to the network for pay. If they don't follow the community's direction, the community will replace them.

`invalidateblock` is a low-level utility RPC intended for use during unexpected emergencies only and code testing. It was created following the March 2013 crisis, where it would have been useful to return the new miners to the proper blockchain.

You're wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:45:08
No, not just any change can be deployed via soft fork. Segwit is probably the only softfork way to ever increase block size, for example.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:44:46
Inability to measure support is irrelevant, since we can clearly see that they have all been rejected without measuring support. Hardforks require ~100%, so any substantial disagreement is a veto, no matter how many people like the idea.
Miners have no say in hardforks.

They're not forking just Bitcoin Core, they're forking *Bitcoin itself*. BU is not Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-18 08:33:56


XT/Classic *were* based on HF proposals originally. Now they're just variants of BU. BU isn't a HF proposal, but a fundamental change to how Bitcoin works that's basically just plain broken.


Not really worried about that. But mining centralisation is still a serious problem anyway. Even if the miners weren't hostile. As things are, they're not only way too centralised, but also hostile *and* holding back progress.

Context matters. I'm referring to these things here:


In terms of the owner actually using it to receive payments, the network needs a large percentage (at least 85%).
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:26:45
That creates a centralising effect on mining.
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:21:20
Bitcoin is failing because of miner and node centralisation. Block sizes are too big, not too small.
If you want Bitcoin to handle a higher transaction volume, what is needed is Lightning.
Furthermore, it's miners, not the development community, who have failed to increase the block size. They have segwit available with a limit increase to 2-4 MB, that they could have activated for months now.
Finally, we're not your slaves, and we have lives too. Despite that, we work typically much more than 40 hours per week on Bitcoin, completely unpaid by you, and the amount of work doesn't get any lighter. Bitcoin simply needs more developers. Hire some to join us. Until then, you have no basis to complain.

At least 5 GB/mo, evenly distributed, running in `blocksonly` mode. Much more if you enable all the services (default).
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:56:17
Maybe we should. Since bigblockers were only asking for 2 MB back when segwit was proposed, giving them that was seen as a perfect solution at the time.
@_date: 2016-03-16 18:59:21
The witness data is part of the normal blockchain, so it will take N+4 in the blockchain as well. However, the 4 bytes count as witness data, so it's only 4 toward the block cost (not 4*4=16) - so the equivalent of 1 byte more in comparison to a 2 MB HF.
If you mean the size of the witness-stripped block (which isn't a relevant number), you end up with N minus the size of the witness data (what used to be scriptSig).
@_date: 2017-02-05 19:23:01
Actually, 2-3 GB of disk space is sufficient if you use Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots. BitCore is not the only full node software.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:14:27
Sufficiently small that &gt;85% of the economy validates payments to them using a full node under their own physical and electronic control.

A hardfork requires *every single Bitcoin user* to upgrade, not just miners.
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:15:45


Also note:
* it improves the confirmation on all previous transactions.
* the alternative to the empty block, would be a *stale* block, which *weakens* the confirmation of the preceding block's transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:55:42
Literally nobody is arguing that...
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:32:58
Most of us Core developers signed off on Greg's roadmap which gives us a block size increase to ~2 MB in a few months...

It'd be tempting to fork Electrum and give it Bitcoin Core's UI, if only it used the HD wallet standards...
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:29:30
Why before segwit? Segwit does a 2-3 MB fork much cleaner.
In any case, we did multiple proposals of blocksize hardforks.  The community rejected them.
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:37:06
It's a real risk. What's the point in all this work to avoid trust, if at the end of the day you're just going to trust anyway?

We don't until they mine an invalid block.


No, because not only is it undetectable in ordinary circumstances, but you also cannot reliably determine what miner mined a block.
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:08:04


Agreed, but the majority of miners do in fact passively sit back and enable this.


The current fixed block size limit is the cleanest way we have so far.
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:49:14
Not merely "effective". The blocks are actually bigger. And if you're so confident 99% will upgrade as a hardfork requires to not be a disaster, then "people won't upgrade!" is not a valid argument. In any case, people  who want the increase can upgrade and get the benefit immediately - others who choose not to don't hold them back.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:03:52
I think they maybe underestimate the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:28:53
With sufficiently-limited block sizes, this inflation takes away from fees they can actually get immediately.

Wait, it only needs to end in r/Bitcoin? Maybe the mods *should* start censoring... (joking!)
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:49:07
No, the best practice in this case is to have a common set of online wallet(s), and a common set of offline wallets, and all users of the website send and receive with the same wallet(s). Users don't have keys themselves, only addresses.

I would recommend stopping after step 9, uninstalling the system's bitcoind entirely, and just running from the build directory (`src/bitcoind` or `src/qt/bitcoin-qt`). Otherwise, you're polluting your system files with non-system-managed stuff, and it's liable to overwrite it when there's an upgrade.

Are you intentionally trolling, or did someone mislead you? Coffee transactions are welcome. Bitcoin isn't being migrated to a settlement layer. There isn't a lack of block space for coffee transactions (yet?). Nobody AFAIK considers coffee txs to be spam.
But at the end of the day, it's *coffee*. You don't need a trustless irreversible payment. It's not worth paying the cost of. Someone isn't going to screw you over for a coffee.  Simply trusting a centralised off-chain service provider for your coffee tab is perfectly reasonable.
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:14:05
Even if Lightning wasn't in the works, we need to do *something* to keep Bitcoin functional as a decentralised system, even if that meant sacrificing some less-valuable use cases. I'm just glad Lightning gives us a good solution to do both. :)

So just hodl through the mid-term.
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:29:46
What you're proposing is a UASF that ruins a version bit. Without at least a supermajority of the economy using it *at the same moment of activation*, it will behave almost the same as a hardfork, splitting you and the minority using it off the Bitcoin network.
If you simply use a normal full node, you are immune to BU's attack. That should be enough.
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:17:06
At the very least, it should be sufficient that the network won't break if a small group colludes to attack it.
With Bitcoin's current properties, that would mean 85% of the economy uses their own full nodes to receive the payment, no miner has over 10% of the network hashpower, and no country has over 25% of the network hashpower in total.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:57:30
UASF is mostly just a proposal right now. I think might be considering banning promotion of software implementing it, but I hope not. It's not a hardfork, after all, and segwit does have widespread acceptance already.
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:36:11
IMO the best way to demonstrate the community supports UASF, is to have people begin using it despite it not being merged into Core. If you get enough onboard, and it makes a much better case for merging it.

That was the *optional* softfork part. It didn't require consensus; only the increases did. And it was the increases that failed to get consensus.

1 MB is the *limit* we have now. It isn't the actual block size yet. And no, Bitcoin does not really work right now:
* Full nodes continue to drop due to high resource requirements
* Miners skip validation
* Miners rely on a centralised relay network
@_date: 2016-01-02 13:29:24
v0.8.1 included an intentional hardfork to cleanly deploy the changes unintentionally made by Mike Hearn originally.
I wouldn't count the accidental case as a hardfork, though, just a bug.

Okay, I've linked it to other devs who have shown interest in such topics.

Currently 96% of full\* nodes are running Core, vs 3% BU.
\* BU is inherently not a full node, but you know what I mean.
@_date: 2017-03-11 05:17:32
This was in the context of the idea of a SPV mode where any full node could broadcast a "fraud proof" to show all the SPV nodes that a given block was invalid. But in the end, it turned out this SPV mode was impossible, so we are left with a situation where the network security requires at least a supermajority running a full node.
Note that the popular light clients commonly called "SPV" are not in fact really SPV.
@_date: 2016-03-14 07:59:34
Then you haven't been around long. We've had far more nodes in the past. And there is incentive already: without a node, you're not getting the benefits of Bitcoin at all, but merely trusting some random third party.
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:46:19
None of the above.
If you want *any* security, you need to use your own full node.
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:01:54

No benefit to multiple nodes usually; the important thing is using it to receive payments.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:19:26
No, today a large chunk of the community opposes any block size hardfork for any reason ever. Segwit is also strictly better than any block size hardfork.

Segwit with a 2 MB block size is literally what "Core" is proposing.
@_date: 2016-01-09 16:05:14
Yes, that's one possible improvement that may make 1 MB workable in the near future.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:00:33
Yeah, doesn't seem unreasonable... just a waste of time. If "Classic" wants to do the hard part (convincing the economy, not mere miners), it's fine with me.
@_date: 2016-01-26 20:08:37




I don't think either of these are possible for mere node software; they necessarily need changes to the consensus protocol, which is outside the scope of any one piece of software.


Changing the fee means changing the tx amount and outputs. The closest thing to this is RBF-FSS, which I'd be happy to merge as an option.

Bitcore has more APIs, but is going to require more storage and just as much bandwidth.
Anything using less bandwidth is insecure and inadvisable.
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:39:12
No, for all practical purposes this would require a hardfork to change. But it gives users a choice whether to follow the hostile BU hardfork, or a defensive hardfork. I think most people would go with the defensive.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:28:57
They're mostly the same, yes. One notable difference is that segwit primarily fixes bugs (one fix of which makes scaling more practical), not just increases the block size.


Nobody can force others out of the network, so it's really the HF that's failing in this scenario.

@_date: 2017-03-04 21:21:23
I don't think UASF is safe beyond reducing the threshold from 95% to 75%, but ultimately as always the decision lies with the community.
UASF also doesn't address the real problem: miners hostile to the network. If miners won't support features that has widespread support from the community, simply forcing a softfork on them isn't really going to by productive in the long-run.
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:14:15
1. Is this for developing Bitcoin, or developing other stuff that uses Bitcoin?
2. What information exactly are you asking for? Hardware specs? OS? Software? Editors?
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:43:27
Nodes and users can't be measured in consensus-critical code; miner signalling can. Furthermore, softforks can be safer deployed by miners. Therefore, it is typically easier and safer to deploy softforks via miner signalling. The purpose isn't to give miners control over the decision, but to coordinate the deployment.
Segwit is likely to be deployed with or without miner coordination, so the effort wasn't wasted.
@_date: 2016-01-25 23:18:24


Perhaps a "hardfork dry run"?


The limit was designed *precisely* for what it is doing now (preventing DoS/spam). And has been around in testing for well over a year. And transaction volume is presently around 40%, and growing at a rate that we have 4 years before it maxes out. It also solves a *number* of defects in Bitcoin, not merely increases the block size.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:30:21

Some discussions I observed were:

@_date: 2016-03-26 00:06:35
If they censor the real blockchain, and you are a miner, they could cause you to create a fork, or follow one they create (at a high cost, *unless* they do this to cause another miner to create one...). However, this only allows them to perform "51% attacks", which is very limited in scope of what they can do if you have a full node.
@_date: 2016-01-10 23:47:04
With regard to transactions: all Bitcoin full nodes presently will not relay them.
With regard to blocks: what you propose is itself a softfork, and you would need miners to support it.
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:25:52

You can do a softfork to make p2pool mandatory. But at the end of the day, that's just forcing people to use a single pool. It doesn't solve the actual problem.

Unconfirmed transactions are just as insecure *without* RBF. On the bright side, you only need to wait about an hour before they become secure - compare that with the alternatives: credit cards take *6 months* for that kind of guarantee.
Hopefully there will be instant confirmations in Bitcoin not too far off, though - that's what Lightning aims to bring.

You don't need to get rid of block weight, to get rid of the block size increase.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:57:51
If the majority of miners switch to BU in a chain-split, Bitcoin will have a sudden drop in hashrate producing blocks. Bitcoin typically adjusts its "block difficulty" every 2 weeks so as to make one new block every 10 minutes on average. However, that 2 weeks is actually measured in blocks, not time, so if 50% of the hashrate drops off, it will take 1 month instead (at 20 minutes per block, or 60 MB per day); if 75% drop off, it will take 2 months (at 40 minutes per block, or 36 MB per day).
In this scenario, Bitcoin is forced to choose between various strategies:
1. **Give miners control over block size limit (via hardfork).** Basically this is conceding victory to BU, and adopting it as the new Bitcoin. Any transactions made on Bitcoin after they split-off will be effectively un-confirmed (no matter how many "confirmations" they received) and need to re-confirm (or be double-spent) on BU's blockchain. Long-term, this is likely to result in Bitcoin being centralised into PayPal 2.0.
2. **Slower blocks for a few months until difficulty adjusts (NO hardfork).** This is the default scenario if we don't/can't come to a consensus: we just wait it out until the difficulty adjusts. Due to reduced capacity, fees will likely increase a bit more, and less-important use cases (as determined by the participants) will be impractical temporarily.
3. **Change difficulty adjustment to adapt to reduction of mining faster (via hardfork).** If the community consents to it, we could make the difficulty react faster to the mining hashrate drop-off. This would basically preserve the network working as-is, with blocks every 10 minutes on average.
4. **Change proof-of-work algorithm to protect Bitcoin and adapt (via hardfork).** In addition to adjusting the difficulty quicker, we can fire all the miners. This is the only way to protect Bitcoin from the BU miners if they attempt to continue attacking our blockchain after they split off. Bitcoin would now be reliant on anyone with a GPU to mine, until new ASICs are developed.
Note that in cases 2 and 3, Bitcoin would be left vulnerable to attack from the BU miners.

UASF isn't a hardfork. Time will tell whether the support or opposition is stronger - I think the jury's still out on that.

Yes, that's a good reason to disregard or minimise the risks - but not an excuse to disregard the requirement of agreement for the change. Hopefully we can figure out a good hardfork for July that everyone can live with, and then we can move forward with doing it.
(Of course, ideally we could just wait another year or two until hardforks would become trivial thanks to sidechains, but oh well...)

So far, they've all failed the basic criteria of "nobody is publicly speaking out in opposition to it". Showing positive acceptance is harder - probably will involve some kind of PoS / coin voting. Resolving this is part of the R&amp;D necessary to develop a safer hardfork.

Because a large part of the community *doesn't* consent to a hardfork, and the HFers think they can force it on them. But neither they, nor we, can force anyone to deploy a hardfork, and without ~100% support in the community, hardforks are simply impossible.
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:22:48
Full node count is dangerously low. Typically the reason for people choosing to not use a full node comes down to block sizes being too big.

The hard part with RAM-intense is:
1. It needs to be cheap to verify. You can't go requiring every full node to have 16 GB dedicated to verifying the proof.
2. It needs to be progress-free. 32 GB shouldn't be able to perform more than 2x better than 16 GB.
@_date: 2016-01-27 02:02:09


We could add it to the roadmap, but it wouldn't be a commitment. It's very likely that if everything already in the roadmap succeeds, a hard fork block increase won't be *needed* for a long time. Besides, the decision for a hardfork is not something developers really have any say in, so it's not our place to commit to one.


Informally, I will reiterate that people should be free to discuss hardfork proposals - but while there are *accusations* that such discussions have been censored, I do not see any evidence of this.

This just shows you don't know what you're talking about. The effective blocksize limit is *lower* than the real one. Segwit's real limit is 4 MB.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:05:18




No, just modify the algorithm so it adapts quicker to a large drop in network hashrate. Without a change, losing 75% of miners means 1 block per 40 minutes, for 2 months.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:55:18


Yes, that seemed like a safe starting point for something that would be acceptable to everyone. Getting that in would not in any way prevent a more aggressive hardfork also.


There is actually a good chance of that, once Lightning is ready.

@_date: 2017-03-25 10:53:19
Softforks do change the consensus *protocol*, but in a fundamentally different way than hardforks. They don't *require* consensus from the community, because of these fundamental differences.
Segwit doesn't allow opting out of the block size increase, just the new features. That's why it ethically requires more support than a normal softfork. But, nobody is objecting to segwit *on grounds that the block size shouldn't be increased*...
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:34:38
Decentralised systems don't have any "official". There's at least a few independent Lightning implementations out there. (I don't have links handy, sorry.)
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:07:41
Yes, they can. Miners choose the nonce freely. If the block doesn't have the desired hash, they can also discard the block and try again.

1. Lightning doesn't have hubs. It's a peer-to-peer model, not hub-and-spoke.
2. Running a Lightning node isn't expensive.
3. Lightning relies on Bitcoin for security, so everyone *still* needs a Bitcoin full node.
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:54:30
No, I am not implying that. While it's true that weakening the privacy would make spam detection easier, it wouldn't justify forcing non-spam to be less private merely for that purpose.
Spam often uses patterns that isn't typical or expected for legitimate transfers, however. So long as they do that, they can be detected in such ways. Long-term the only practical solution is likely to make legitimate transactions much cheaper so spam is too costly.
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:40:21


It's happening without new versions. I agree it's suspicious, and wonder if there's a problem with the math, but haven't found any yet.


My stats *definitely* underestimate the number of pSPV nodes on the network. I wish I could improve this, but I don't know how.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:01:59
No, it *is* that you don't know what you're talking about (or are lying about the facts). Segwit sends, as all part of a single block together, a total of up to 4,000,000 bytes. The same data in those 4 MB that currently is counted toward 1 MB. So long as the sum WU of those 4 MB are &lt;= 4M WU - which is effectively 2 to 3 MB worth of tx.

IOW, LocalBitcoins is incompetent?
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:57:40
Normally block size increases do require a hardfork, but Segwit delivers an increase to 2-3 MB blocks with only a softfork. That is what Core is already proposing.

They don't? Why not? The solution for credit cards is eating/insuring the fraud; why not take the same approach for Bitcoin? Most people don't want to even wait the 1 hour verification bitcoin needs in ideal circumstances anyway.
Of course, the Lightning network can change this by making near-instant confirmation possible... but that's beside the point.


And if fraud is too rampant, they can start asking for ID like they do with cheques, and go after people legally when they defraud them.

Initial Blockchain Download


What involved transactions? The merkle tree is invalid. The only thing you can do is tell the SPV node "you're going to have to download and verify the whole block". Now the attacker just hides it in the parent block: gotta download and verify both. You end up with a DoS where to prove the fraud, you need the *capacity* to run a full node, even if you don't ordinarily maintain one.

Your premise is wrong. They did do something stupid. Have you seen block sizes lately? 1 MB is *not* safe. The only reason it's "working" at all is because miners all use a centralised backbone (which can censor).

Right, I've thought about that. Not sure how it would affect the idea.
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:54:34
All softforks (and hardforks for that matter) are User-Enforced first and foremost. It is only a matter of convenience that the users have at times chosen to have miners coordinate the *activation* of them. It's not that miners have any real say in the matter. When they refuse to cooperate, it's pretty rational to suggest coordinating the update in another manner instead.
But I consider it important that insofar as UASF is *User-*Activated, it's best if developers avoid pushing it one way or the other. As such, I am staying out of the decision of whether to do it or not. There are risks, there are benefits, but the decision is for everyone to make as a community. But one thing I will say is that it's not in theory *wrong* or fundamentally flawed.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:01:24
You mean an altcoin splitting off? That would go against their goal to force everyone else to adopt it...

@_date: 2017-03-13 08:46:12


It's describing the process of softforks.


Satoshi was a real person (or people), and changed his opinions with time as he learned more about how his invention behaved (as have all developers who have worked with it since). Originally, he expected hardforks to be impossible. By late 2010, he considered that they would be possible. Even in late 2010, he didn't think a block size increase was a good idea (he backed up telling people not to use jgarzik's change), just that it would be needed eventually (all current devs agree).


Except BU is completely broken. Anyone competent in the field who seriously looks at its model concludes it can't work.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:13:44
Bitcoin isn't subject to hostile takeovers. If a "takeover" succeeds, that basically means it was consensual.
Also, BU has like 1-3% of users supporting it, most of whom are deceived by lies. That's not anywhere near consensus.

Softforks rely on miners only for backward compatibility with obsolete or non-full nodes. The actual rule addition is enforced by all full nodes, and cannot be reversed by miners. It's always safe to run a full node, but not necessarily to run anything less than a full node.
Additionally, Satoshi treated checkpoints as part of the consensus system. Core is moving away from this, but it's a stretch to say checkpoints violate the rules in any sense when the creator himself implemented them intentionally.

SPV nodes would rely on full nodes to broadcast "fraud proofs", and use those to attain full node security even without being full nodes themselves. The data structures in Bitcoin were designed such as to make these fraud proofs possible. The fatal flaw is that a malicious entity isn't constrained to Bitcoin's data structures - they can make a "block" that is *unprovably* invalid by violating the fundamental structure of it. Worse still, they could make a perfectly valid block, but keep just a tiny number of bytes (eg, 32 bytes, less than a transaction worth) secret to prevent it from being accepted in the main chain - effectively the same as an invalid block as far as the network is concerned.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:45:09

@_date: 2017-03-19 03:22:56
* Segwit more than doubles the block size.
* BU not only risks centralising the system, but is a complete redesign of how Bitcoin works in general, in a way almost all experts consider broken.
* Lightning is a p2p network. Similar to the blockchain, it is not run by anyone, and is trustless. Both the blockchain and Lightning are/will be part of Bitcoin itself.

1. The transaction fee is paying the miner.
2. The cost of mining the transaction is greater than the fee. (transactions are being subsidised by miners for the good of the network)
3. The miner is not who needs to provide the resources spammers are consuming; the nodes provide the resources, and they are entirely unpaid.
4. The notorious spammers have social engineered a way to avoid paying any transaction fees themselves, yet having their spam include a fee greater than real transactions.
Transaction fees do not exist to pay for blockchain space, they exist to deter spam. And, as they always do, spammers have figured out a way to bypass that spam filter.


This assumes a perfectly rational world. However, humans enjoy entertainment, and are willing to pay for entertainment. So as long as spammers can make participation in spam entertaining, they can get humans to subsidise their spam.

Bitcoin doesn't work that way. Addresses only receive, they don't hold or send. Pending transactions also never expire, and funds are never "sent back" unless the recipient of it manually does so.
You can't send coins you don't have. A payment from WalletB-&gt;WalletC that required funds from a payment from WalletA, could not confirm until the payment from WalletA confirmed. If the fee on B-&gt;C is high enough, miners are likely to mine both A-&gt;B and B-&gt;C just to get that fee.

Just out of curiosity:

2. How much volume of untrusted payments do you receive using your node? (This determines its relevance in the decision-making.)
@_date: 2016-01-09 21:08:10
Old nodes don't see the witness data, so they do the &lt;=1MB comparison with only part of the block. New nodes need to make sure that part of the block remains before 1 MB (to make it a softfork), but can omit or raise that rule when checking the entire block's size.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:17:47

SegWit turns the current "block size limit" into a weird kind of "size limit for witness-stripped block".


That's nonsense. SegWit's primary benefits have nothing to do with the block size or scalability. Even if we enforced the 1 MB limit on the block size again, SegWit would still stand on its own merits.

"NACK" is short for "I oppose this change".
"BIP" is short for "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal", the formal way in which improvements to Bitcoin itself (not Core or any other specific implementation) are drafted, get peer review, and eventually achieve adoption by the community (or not). Basically it involves writing a document explaining what change exactly is desired, mailing it to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list (note: also *not* Core-affiliated) for suggestions and review, and then when the author decides it is ready, publishing it to a git repository for possible acceptance by the community.
@_date: 2016-01-06 05:56:37
You can't mine an orphan block, but a new node that hasn't synced yet might not know about the parent to the most recent block, for example. Since Core 0.10, it basically never happens any more (by design), but was fairly commonplace in earlier versions.

From [our open letter a few months ago](


But note that Bitcoin is a consensus system (specifically for finance), *not* a data storage or database system. Plenty of *better* solutions for those already exist. It is true that Bitcoin's blockchain's DMMS is potentially useful for timestamping, and this is a great area to explore on its own (personally, I hope to have a feature builtin to Core or LJR 0.13 demonstrating how to do it sanely), but is inevitably something independent from Bitcoin itself.

Yes... and sortof-no. If you don't update your backup, you will lose information like labels and "is this output change?" data. This can be quite confusing, and often metadata can be just as important as the money. If you created your wallet with 0.13 or newer (the bottom should show "HD" *not crossed out*), then you won't lose money. But if it's crossed out (non-HD) then you must backup at least every 100 (make it 90 to be safe) transactions or you will lose money too.
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:25:28
Hardforks do indeed require SPV users to update. The only difference between a "hard" hardfork and a soft-hardfork, is that the "hard"  hardfork leaves old nodes *insecure and vulnerable*, while the soft-hardfork leaves them simply non-functional.
Note, however, there are not at present *any* actual SPV nodes. Typically what people call "SPV" is merely a light client that does not in fact implement SPV. Using such clients doesn't make someone a Bitcoin user at all, but merely a client trusting some (often randomly chosen) centralised service. If these were to ever be more than a minority of the economy, Bitcoin would ceased to have *any rules whatsoever* and be as a whole entirely insecure.

Hardforks require 100% of users to upgrade. Segwit provides growth proportional to % of users using it. So even if it's not an immediate jump to 2-3 MB, it's still far better than what a hardfork can deliver.
Since it's a softfork, it's also safer to activate and begin using sooner. A hardfork needs at least several months lead time, probably over a year (perhaps even multiple years) in practice.

Nobody was running a bridge node to relay blocks from pre-segwit miners to the rest of the network. Segwit-enabled nodes will only try to download blocks from other segwit-enabled peers, since pre-segwit nodes won't *have* the full block to download in the first place.
**This isn't a problem for mainnet** for a number of reasons. Even in the worst-case scenario, it only takes one person running an anonymous "bridge" node to carry the blocks from pre-segwit to the main network. But before that, miners need to have a segwit-aware "gateway" node to secure their pre-segwit mining node anyway, and submitting their non-segwit blocks to that gateway node (as any sane miner would do anyway) will just work. Furthermore, miners are all using centralised backbones for block relay, *not* the p2p network - this too will just work.


No. Chain splits and hardforks are two different things. Both softforks and hardforks can cause chain splits in certain conditions (although it's a lot more likely with a hardfork).

No, someone would need to mine a single malicious block, and the network would split likely permanently. The non-segwit miners would never go back to the segwit-compatible chain. I'd say the probability of that malicious block is pretty high considering the damage it would case.

Lots of people trust us to give good advice. The economy can do what it will, but lying about us supporting bad decisions reflects poorly on us.


No, but I have seen no such draft BIP, and I subscribe to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, so I would certainly have seen it.


Perfectly fine for them to try, but only using *honest* methods. Lying about others supporting them who don't, in order to try to gain support, is far from that.

Economic pressure. If the majority of nodes don't verify the rules, they may quickly grow to depend on an invalid block before humans can intervene, and the minority full nodes may be pressured to accept the invalid block despite whatever problem it had. If it's 50/50, it's up in the air what the outcome might be. 85% gives a reasonable certainty that the protocol rules will be upheld.


A nation controlling hashrate directly would fall under the 10% limit. The 30% should be inclusive of all miners operating within the nation's borders (and therefore at risk of seizure by the government).

It just generates a single ECDSA keypair, which isn't a real wallet since it can only be securely used once (to receive, and then once to send).

Segwit gets an increase proportional to the number of users who use it. So if 100% of users upgrade, you get the full 2-3 MB.
Hardforks are only possible if 100% upgrade. So you don't get any more or any faster with  hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:49:49
It's not more ASIC-proof, but AFAIK it should be simple enough to be equally ASICable.
The difference is such ASICs don't exist yet, so it gives a restart and a chance to hopefully get a better outcome this time.

It varies.
* Block size needs to be reduced, but have accepted the compromise of segwit increasing block size to 2-3 MB.

Hardforks necessarily must be decided by consensus from all the *users* of Bitcoin, not the miners. The miners simply work for the users, according to the rules set down by the users. So a hardfork might be possible someday, but never against the users' consent.

No, because a hardfork attempt will be rejected by non-consenting full nodes no matter how many miners back it. With a softfork (including UASF), once the miners follow the incentives, the rest of the nodes remain compatible.

There is no such thing as CPU-only proof-of-work, and it's actually impossible. Besides, even if it were possible, that would just give Intel/AMD a huge advantage over anyone else - or worse, botnets.
Memory-based PoW, or even PoS, are arguably the ideal, but nobody has figured out a good solution for those (yet?).
Best we could do right now is a PoW change that resets to GPUs. FPGAs will likely soon follow, with ASICs a number of months away. Perhaps it will give a competitive advantage to new manufs, and maybe it will send a wakeup call to miners that they're not in charge, but unless that next round of ASICs are better distributed, we'll be back to where we are now.
That's not to say we can't do it, however. The current situation is clearly unacceptable, and pretty much any change would be an improvement, even if just temporary. The important first step is to get the community onboard. Thank you for working on that here. :)

You mean connected in terms of having a channel open? Each channel requires dedicated funds. Lightning is designed to make lots of channels expensive.

The size of blocks is directly related to the size of the blockchain. Any average block size over say 300k actually results in *infinitely growing* costs to start up a new node, *even after accounting for improvements in technology*.
Block sizes alone are also a real centralisation problem for already-running nodes *and* (independently) for miners as well.
Basically there are a number of independent problems increasing the block size prematurely can cause.

Consider the event that there are two chains, one invalid with more work/blocks and the other valid with fewer work/blocks, with the chains having double-spends defrauding some large portion of the economy. This and similar scenarios are essentially the only time the Bitcoin protocol comes into relevance at all (and if these scenarios are ignored or made economically viable, they are much more likely to occur).
Light clients don't know the difference between the two chains, and people using them will commit to the double-spends on the invalid chain (by shipping product, etc).
If the majority of the economy falls in this category, the economically rational decision for them is to accept the invalid chain as authoritative, and bribe enough of the minority to essentially hardfork away at least that one rule violation in the invalid chain. Thus, the Bitcoin protocol loses its solid rules, and is reduced to nothing more than a what-miners-say-goes centralised currency. This in turn creates incentives for the miners to ignore the rules entirely, and you end up with just another fiat currency.
If a barely-majority uses full nodes, you don't have quite as bad a situation, but you do have a situation where you could end up with a permanent chain split, or at the very least a significant loss of confidence in Bitcoin.
Therefore, I conclude that what is needed to enforce the rules of the system firmly, is a super-majority of the economy using full nodes. Perhaps it doesn't need to be a full 85%, but that seems like a reasonable percentage to be able to say for certain that these scenarios will cleanly resolve with the Bitcoin protocol intact.

Actual transaction volume these days is about 400k/block on average (and it's perfectly reasonable/expected for low priority transactions to be delayed a number of blocks during bursts).


It really can't. Any attempt to hardfork on a quicker time frame will almost certainly cause irreversible damage to (perhaps death of) Bitcoin. Essentially everyone must agree to accept the changes for a hardfork and upgrade before the deadline, and it is apparent that there remain people opposed to a larger block size limit even today.


How do you consider this obvious? Only a minority of users (mostly miners and some people on reddit) have expressed they want to hardfork. Of the merchant economy, BitPay only claims to represent 3%, and it is very unclear who would represent the other 97%.


This is the fault of real-world costs, and spam - not the block size limit. Increasing the limit is unlikely to improve the situation substantially either, as miners ought to continue making &lt;1MB blocks even with a higher limit until the Internet and node software can be improved to handle &gt;1MB blocks safely.


On the contrary, it would seem the price drops correlate with contentious hardfork attempts.

protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid

There's no reason the UTXO limits couldn't be added along with the 2 MB hardfork.
Part of the problem with hardforks is that the *default* is that it won't happen *unless* you convince basically everyone to do it.
A supermajority of the economy might be able to force a minority into submission, but the more I think about this, the less likely it seems.

Let's say we start at Block XYZ at height 1000.
Another miner now finds Block ABC at height 1001.
You won't know what transactions to put in height 1002 for some non-zero duration of time.
You must choose between:
1. Turn off miners.
2. Continue mining height 1001, and produce a competing/stale block.
3. Begin mining height 1002 with an empty block.

Yes, Bitcoin is governance-resistant. Any change to the established rules requires opt-in consent from every user, just like a migration to any altcoin would - nobody can be forced to migrate. Politics are just a distraction.
@_date: 2016-03-08 22:09:11
Empty blocks are good for the network. They help secure the blockchain just as much as any other block. Furthermore, the *only alternative* to those empty blocks (assuming a properly configured miner) is stale blocks, which are de facto an *attack on* the network's security. So a miner that *literally never* produced empty blocks is actually harming the network in the process.
That being said, empty blocks can *also* be a symptom of headers-only mining, which is also harmful to the network. Last I checked, I think Antpool was known to be guilty of this.

Miners and users may *want* various things, but there are no *needs* here. Furthermore, developers have no duty to anyone, except perhaps people who pay them to do stuff.

The outcome from blocking valid transactions in blocks, is far worse than the outcome from not-blocking invalid ones.


I think SegWit is actually better as a softfork, than a hardfork, because it allows everyone to opt-in and upgrade at their own pace rather than be forced to switch at a flag-day or lose access altogether.

The open-ness isn't so relevant in this case, since most people can't have chips made anyway. What's more important is that they be as widely distributed as possible, ideally at a break-even (or close to it) price.
Even better would be to have them smart-property, so they can be co-located safely without giving the data center the ability to usurp control of them.

Lightning is just an extension on top of the blockchain. Whenever it uses the blockchain, miners collect the fees. Because reliable transaction commitment in the blockchain is important for Lightning, it's less likely people will be trying to bid so close to the "barely gets through" line, and will pay whatever fees miners require to guarantee reliable confirmation.

The idea wasn't to raise the limit to 32 MB, just to make it so that any new limit beginning in 2020 would become a softfork rather than a hardfork. It's not an entirely unreasonable idea, except that 1) it only makes a simple block size hardfork easier (ie, not addressing any of the other things we'd want fixed in a HF), and 2) it uses a fixed date, regardless of whether we reach consensus on the new limit.
I had a similar proposal some months ago, but mine relaxed *most* of the rules (not just the size limit), and used &lt;release date&gt; + &lt;expiry time&gt; instead of just a fixed date. It turned out to be too complicated to implement reasonably.
I think a good middle-ground would be to have the node just stop working when it's &lt;n&gt; years old, unless the owner overrides it. This way there's no complicated consensus code changes, but we get the same benefit, if and only if a hardfork is agreed on.

1. Hardforks are a lot of work (several months) to coordinate.
2. SegWit is likely to be done and deployed within a few months, including a block size limit increase to ~2 MB.
3. Therefore, before any safe hardfork to 2 MB is practical, we will already have the capacity for 2 MB blocks.
I don't see any reason to *resist* it, but I see no reason to burn time on it either... (not to mention that as developers, we do better with technological solutions rather than social/coordination)
@_date: 2017-02-16 19:40:04
Ethically any increase in system requirements to use Bitcoin needs at least widespread agreement (I'd say above 90%). Currently, segwit raises the block size limit, so it falls in that category despite being a softfork. So if anyone is seriously considering reducing the activation threshold, please also remove the block size limit increase also (or at least strongly insist on signalling not beginning until &gt;90% have clearly assented to it).

A change in PoW would send the message clearly to miners "if you are unfair, you lose your investment", and hopefully the next round of ASICs would not be so un-distributed.
Smart Property (SP) ASICs are chips which embed the public key of their owner, and refuse to hash work unless it is signed by that key. Thus, when they are colocated, they cannot be hijacked by the datacentre owner/operator. To date, no such chips or devices exist, so all colocated mining is effectively centralised in its location.

Miners violated the agreement less than a week after it was signed.
Despite that, the developers involved including myself completed the agreed-on assignment. First, we did our best to come up with code for a safe hardfork with 2 MB non-segwit txs. But that was looking like it would take much longer than 3 months, so I also put together the best, safest 2 MB hardfork I could recommend immediately, wrote a BIP and submitted an implementation to the Core git repo.
However, the community has rejected both of these proposals. Hardforks cannot move forward to activation without ~100% agreement from the entire community, so things are basically at a stand-still in that regard now. (Note that merging to Core and activation were explicitly and upfront *not* part of the agreement. We have neither authority nor power to force a hardfork if the community rejects it.)
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:37:26

Actually, we don't. So long as the block sizes are kept close to actual usage, the spam can be eliminated simply by the legitimate usages outbidding them on fees.
A concern might be that spammers are willing to pay more than legitimate users. This can be fixed by Lightning reducing legitimate data usage significantly below spam usage, so that the fee/byte can be significantly higher (outpricing spam) while at the same time reducing per-financial-transaction costs.

A soft-hardfork is a hardfork where existing nodes continue to see the new blockchain, but only as empty blocks (they stop maintaining the correct UTXO set), and existing wallets cease to be capable of receiving transactions.
With a softfork such as segwit, nodes are slightly degraded in a SPV-like manner, but otherwise continue to keep track of valid blocks (maintaining the UTXO set) and existing wallets continue to function correctly.
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:39:46
Well, whether we need &gt;1.6MB blocks is itself a semi-technical question. I don't see any way to avoid an eventual block size increase (via hardfork), but it's quite possible that some Satoshi out there will show up suddenly with a better solution.
Also, I think it's likely we can get to 2 MB with segwit.

I certainly don't. Even back when I started Eligius, it was on a fully dedicated server. Note also that I have long been a proponent for decentralised mining, which would mean it is the end miner's node (not the one on the pool server) that gets used.


It is the only way to actually use Bitcoin, in the sense of a trustless way to receive payments.


"SPV" today unfortunately requires a *lot* of trust on third parties. Satoshi had some oversights in Bitcoin's design that prevent real SPV from being possible. SegWit may improve the theoretical situation, but does not change the fact that any real SPV node *must* be *capable* of upgrading to a full node on demand.

The fact that ETC still exists proves that Ethereum's attempted hardfork failed. They created a new currency, rather than upgrading the original one. That might not necessarily be a bad thing, but it's a lie to claim it's still the original.

There's two different kinds of "centralisation" possible:
1. People doing transactions using trusted off-chain systems. This is basically only a threat if those off-chain holders stop allowing on-chain withdrawls (perhaps due to regulation). It allows hijacking most bitcoins, but doesn't interfere with people using Bitcoin directly.
2. On-chain being transformed into a bank-only system. This is what happens if the blockchain size gets too big, such as with BU. Bitcoin ceases to be usable to most people.
BU's threat far outweighs the earlier one.
Note also that we will have *decentralised and trustless* off-chain transactions as soon as segwit is activated, hopefully reducing the former risk as well.

Currently, Bitcoin transaction ids (including the serial numbers for coins they create) are based on hashing the entire transaction's data. Because part of the transaction can be changed by literally anyone, they can also change the transaction id under people unexpectedly. By changing the coins' serial numbers, they also "break" pre-signed spends of those coins. This is called the [unintended] malleability problem (not to be confused with malleability *in general*, which includes *intentional* changes by the sender/signer).
Segwit fixes this by skipping over signatures when generating the transaction id.
One side effect of this is that obsolete nodes can no longer *see* the signatures at all. As such, they fail to enforce the size limit correctly on new blocks, and this creates an opportunity to increase the block size limit, provided the new limit is carefully designed.
Because spending coins currently costs 4x as much as creating them, and the spending actually has lower expense for nodes, Segwit was designed to weigh signature data as only 1/4 of the normal limit. This enables block sizes up to 4 MB (but realistically more like 2-3 MB because you can't make sane blocks with *only* signature data).
Segwit also fixes a bug where transactions take more than linear time to validate as they get larger.
BU is a fundamental redesign of the system Bitcoin currently uses. Since it is highly controversial, it would effectively be a new altcoin beginning with Bitcoin's balances as a pre-mine.
The idea is that you basically have two sets of rules.
The first set (customised by yourself) are rules on what blocks you will subjectively accept as a valid block immediately. If a block meets that criteria, you consider it valid. If it doesn't, you mark it as "tentatively invalid" status. But you still watch the most-work chain, even if it's "tentatively invalid". If that chain remains the most-work chain for N blocks more than the "tentatively invalid" block, you accept that block despite it violating your own rules, and move on as if it were valid.
The second set of rules are the "real" hard-and-fast rules. If a block violates those rules, you don't even consider it tentatively valid, and you reject it completely like Bitcoin does right now. Under no circumstances will you ever accept a chain using this block, no matter how much better the work it has. (These hard-and-fast rules are inherently necessary, because you might not be capable of even parsing a sufficiently modified block.)
BU simply lifts the block size limit in the second set of rules to an absurdly high amount, and users must trust miners collectively not to make nor accept blocks which are too big.
Most experts, myself included, consider BU to be reckless, broken, and/or inherently centralising (PayPal 2.0).
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:48:57
You are correct that segwit does not directly enable future block size increases beyond 4 MB without a hardfork (although it does make them more practical by fixing some bugs).

Fee is not relevant to my point.




It's not, because it will presumably get some confirmation before your pizza is done baking. But until it's been mined in at least one block, it's extremely trivial for you to have double spent it by simply broadcasting a conflicting transaction that relays slower close to miner nodes. Since your merchant transaction relays faster, 99% of the nodes will see that first, while the mining nodes will be part of the 1% who see the conflict first.

When: Ideally, I would like to see Lightning implemented and in regular use, and fee-less settlements needing to wait until off-peak blocks to confirm. If we hit a real emergency situation, I think it's practical to pull off the hardfork in a matter of weeks (similar to 0.8.1's). If businesses want to avoid an emergency situation, I think they should contribute toward getting Lightning going. Another alternative may be to solve miner incentives so they're not in conflict with the interests of full nodes - but I don't know of any sound proposals to do that.
How: Might be nice to include some long-deferred hardforks (eg, native merged mining, which Satoshi proposed in 2010), but not necessary. In an emergency situation, probably should just do the simplest viable change to be safe.
How much: I'd prefer to be able to continue running a full node myself... Other than that, my concern would be the lack of a solution for spam and the related conflict of interest for miners.
That being said, I don't care too strongly about the change being under ideal circumstances or whatever. I just don't see it as a priority topic right now.

It's not *entirely* true, but also not entirely false (in a meaningless way).
Segwit native *requires and provides* more security for smart contracts, which uses 12 more bytes per such output. For simple single-key payments, however, it does not use any more space.
Wrapping segwit in BIP16 (old P2SH) for backward-compatible non-BIP70 addresses, however, uses 22-34 bytes extra. This is inherent to BIP 13 addresses, and couldn't be avoided even with a hardfork.
A hardfork segwit would not be any better, neither in this nor any other way. But it would be contentious, because it includes a block size increase, and many in the community oppose any increase to the block size. Segwit as a softfork is only viable because as a softfork it *doesn't require* consensus.
There are no decentralised altcoins. Centralisation makes hardforks somewhat easier...
P.S. Segwit's increase is to 2 MB blocks, not merely 86%. Better smart contracts may even lead to 3 MB blocks being practical.

I don't agree. BU as an evil fork is even more of an attack than it currently is. (If it had consensus, then I'd agree, but it doesn't, not even close.)


Their only way of dealing with the problem is a Proof of Work change.
If miners aren't hostile, there is another option: allow the original chain to continue with a trivial softfork. Ideally, the original chain should even be possible to merge-mine along with the new one, so miners can support *both* chains.
For example, [my incomplete "MMHF" draft]( is designed such that the current chain can easily opt-out by simply making block version 0x60?????? invalid. If an original chain survives and wishes, it could also do its own hardfork to become merge-mined along side the new chain by changing the `vector_position_for_hc` algorithm's `chain_id` parameter.
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:04:46

Well, Satoshi did originally say hardforks were *impossible*. But he later developed further on how it might be possible, and those of us who have been actually working on Bitcoin since then have taken that further. We had no problems with the 2013 hardfork.

Sounds like your PC is broken. Instead of complaining that Bitcoin [tries to] use it, you should probably look into getting it fixed.


Reindexing doesn't redownload (unless your node is pruned, maybe). Also, it only happens if the database gets corrupted - not normally something that should happen in event of a simple reboot. Although there was (is?) a bug that causes it to get corrupt in some circumstances, but I've only ever seen it happen on a SD card, not a normal hard drive.
You're welcome to pay a developer to dedicate a large chunk of time to making the IBD less painful, but those of us already working on Bitcoin typically have higher priorities, and unfortunately only so much time in a day.
If you're questioning our priorities now, consider that *most* users don't have to IBD more than once, and it's only a problem on flaky hardware, where it would not be safe to run a node or wallet anyway (because nodes and wallets need to be literally *perfect* with their calculations).

The Bitcoin users have no reason to switch *to BU's protocol*.

No, it only proves you receive a bitcoin payment to the address.

Yes, spam often tries to disguise itself as normal transactions, so almost every spam filter has false positives. In the long run, spam can only be prevented by making it too expensive. In other words, on-chain fees need to go up until the spam stops.
Unfortunately, one problem this has is that spam is typically *willing to pay more* than non-spam.
To avoid increasing the fees for non-spam too much, the goal is to reduce on-chain data usage needed for transfers of bitcoins. This way, each transfer of value can pay a cheap fee, while spam has no way to avoid paying huge fees.

Mining is too centralised for sidechains. But considering how broken BU is, that might not be a problem for it...

Yes, that describes the segwit softfork spec'd in BIP 141 and deployed in Core 0.13.1+.

Sounds like he's partly describing segwit there. But with some impossible ideas; you can't just accept invalid data - you don't know how to parse or interpret it!
Also, a softfork is a fork in the protocol, not a fork on the blockchain. So yes, it really is still a softfork...

IIRC that wasn't really a softfork.


Yes, ~100% (or close enough to practically be it) from the entire community.


Developers don't make these decisions.


Yes, that was all done, but the community has chosen to reject such proposals at this time.


That sounds like extension blocks. It's similar to a softfork in that it doesn't *technically require* consensus, but similar to a hardfork in that it *ethically* does. It also increases the block size for all practical purposes, and does the same harm on decentralisation that a hardfork would. For these reasons, I consider a hardfork strictly superior to an extension block.

The most obvious way to handle it is to just open a channel the moment you want to send to someone who you can't reach with Lightning otherwise. Even with the blockchain, you need to "sign off on" more funds than you're sending, so this isn't really a change from the status quo.

"SegWit transactions" are the new "normal bitcoin transactions". In ordinary circumstances, miners can produce a block that is 2 MB in size from such normal transactions. (4 MB is not practical, since transactions cannot be all witness data.) Note that for fair comparison with a hardfork, you *must* assume *everyone* has upgraded, since a hardfork by definition cannot happen otherwise.
I support SegWit because it solves actual problems (malleability, etc) that need to be solved. Increasing the limit is a "free" opportunity we can/should take. Miners should, however, continue to make &lt;1 MB blocks until it makes sense to produce larger ones.

@_date: 2016-01-20 03:19:00
Yes, I've been pondering that for a few days, and haven't figured out a clear-cut risk-free process. My best guess right now is to have BitPay, Coinbase, et al estimate their marketshare conservatively and figure out what % of their merchants explicitly support the change, are happy going along with it, or actively oppose it and would change processors if they hardforked. But this places a lot of trust on centralised payment processors. The more I think about this, the more I like the idea of doing a soft-hardfork rather than just a straight hardfork, so old nodes are left disabled rather than vulnerable.
Once the community as ascertained that virtually everyone is prepared to do the hardfork, it should at that point just be deployed as a flag-day change (the way Satoshi suggested way back when, based simply on the timestamp or height of the block).
@_date: 2016-01-18 03:47:34




Actually, they're mostly orthogonal. SegWit doesn't *need* to include a capacity increase, so we could very well do that via a hardfork and do SegWit without the side effect. Only reason to avoid the hardfork is because it's a waste of time trying to coordinate it (convincing everyone to adopt it, etc).

Satoshi chose 1 MB based on a guess on what would be overwhelming to nodes in 2010. Turned out he was wrong, and it's still too much today in 2017. :(  We've been playing catch-up, and hopefully it will become more reasonable given enough time.
The increase of fees is due to higher fee-paying spam volume. The block size doesn't really affect it much.
Note that each transaction costs the network *more* than current fees, so even as fees are increasing, you're still being subsidized by the network. Such subsidy can't last forever, though, and fees are bound to get even higher.

1. For each of the 3 inputs, click "Output" and note the number of blocks confirmed they are. As of right now, that's 1171, 1009, and 885.
2. Multiply each by the number of satoshis in the input.
So, for the first input, 4611651 * 1171 = 5400243321.
3. Add the sum of them all together: ((4611651 * 1171) + (1981145 * 1009) + (5125839 * 885)) = 11935586141.
4. Look at the original transaction now for the Size. It's 616 bytes in this case. For each input, subtract 151.  (616 - (151*3)) = 163
5. Divide the result from step 3 by the result from step 4. 11935586141 / 163 = 73224454.85276073. This is approximately the transaction's *priority*.
Transactions become eligible for priority mining when this result reaches 57600000. Since this one is well over that, it should just be a matter of a miner finding a block who cares about Bitcoin enough to do priority mining. However, also note that most miners limit their priority mining to about 50k, so if there are higher priority transactions, this one won't get in until those are mined first. There are at this time *lots* of higher priority transactions, up to 35411708878854.38281250

Softforks like segwit are both optional and not optional. It is optional because old nodes will continue to work correctly. It is not optional because they cease to be full nodes. So there is never a case where you would want to use a non-segwit node - it is more or less the same as using a pseudo-SPV node (albeit slightly more secure because *most* of the rules are checked).
Because the block size limit is increased, non-segwit transactions benefit also. The only time they don't, is when their total weight itself exceeds the 4M weight limit (ie, no segwit txs at all).
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:12:31
Even if that transaction is valid, it doesn't prove that it was not double-spent. The blockchain is used to prove that, but the proof relies on knowing that the block including it is itself valid. That requires knowing that every transaction included in that block and all its previous blocks are each themselves valid. There is no way to prove a given block is *not* valid, except by running a full node.

About an hour, if you pay a good fee. (If not, it depends on miners' charity.)

It's not mentioned *how* they plan to use a blockchain, but it doesn't seem like it's something Bitcoin's main blockchain is literally *capable* of (at the very least, since insurance is inherently *fractional reserve* while the blockchain only supports full reserves)... so I would assume they need a separate blockchain anyway.

Fees going up isn't a problem, but expected. Decentralised systems are inherently more expensive than centralised ones.
Higher fees won't reduce node usage, except to the extent that it also reduces light client usage, and in this scenario is likely to reduce light client usage more than full node usage. That would mean full node percentage increases and therefore network decentralisation improves.
Better to have fewer users and less usage, in a decentralised manner, than to have Bitcoin become just another centralised payment system implemented in a gratuitously inefficient manner. There are plenty of those already, probably all more efficient than Bitcoin could ever be.
*That being said...* Lightning solves the "fee problem" without compromising Bitcoin at all.

BIP 140 proposes to fix only malleability, but it has basically no support.
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:15:47
What they should be doing so long as they want to operate altruistically is prioritising based on value and age of the coins being spent. This tends to favour legitimate usage over spam, independent of the fees of either (although you still need a reasonable fee to get relayed and stay in their mempool).
Bitcoin Core has supported this for years (since v0.7.0 in 2012), and until v0.12.0 enabled it for the first 50k of each block by default. [Now it is being threatened with complete removal in v0.15.0 as even an *option*]( and I stand alone as the only developer willing to support it ([one pool operator has voiced his support also]( but was mostly ignored).
Time is quickly running out for people to help keep Bitcoin Core policy-neutral... miners can help by manually enabling coin-age priority (put `blockprioritysize=100000` in `bitcoin.conf` where 100000 is amount of bytes to dedicate to it), and let Core know you're using it and want it kept supported.

Yes, there was.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:33:12
Not entirely. If the economy is going to begin enforcing a softfork, the miners have a strong incentive to comply (they lose the block reward for every invalid block they mine).
The same is not true of miner-initiated hardforks, since users have literally no reason to start accepting miners' invalid blocks.

Besides that, empty blocks serve a useful purpose. They increase the security of transactions already on the blockchain they confirm.
Additionally, the alternative to empty blocks is *typically not* a full block, but rather a *stale* block. Stale blocks *detract from* the security provided by the most recent block.
@_date: 2017-02-10 08:56:55
It would need a hardfork. But once we get Lightning, block sizes can drop significantly. Maybe we'll still need more than 2-3 MB someday, but hopefully we'll have time to figure out how to do hardforks safely before then.

Rather, afraid of trying to force a hardfork on everyone else. After all, if the community does in fact want to hardfork at some point and miners *don't* go along with it, changing PoW would *also* be the approach. The point is that miners must follow the community's lead on this, not try to control the community's decision.
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:22:58
That is the process for *SOFT*forks, where miner majority is sufficient. *HARD*forks need consensus from *the entire economy*, not merely miners (which all together represent much less than 1%).
There has only ever been one hardfork in the past, and it was increasing the block size from ~500k to 1 MB, which was completely uncontroversial because everyone had previously believed the limit to already be 1 MB (and the more recent information of 1 MB being too high was not yet known).

That would be *the point*.


It is a hardforking change, literally no different than increasing the block size limit. Yes, without consensus to make the change it becomes an altcoin, but that fact doesn't seem to be popular here... With consensus, however, it is simply an upgrade to Bitcoin.

It's been in testing for over a year now, and there's no need to "buy time" since transaction volume is only around 400k/block right now and is unlikely to double before SegWit gets deployed.

To be consensus-safe, it needs a way that is reproducible deterministically. We can't just take any forked chain 288 blocks long (ignoring the length of the main chain) as a trigger either, since someone could take their time to mine it as an attack.

tl;dr: ~~Jihan~~ someone admits he knows blocking segwit is wrong, but thinks he can get away with it to force people to give him money. BU is just an excuse to block segwit, not a real goal.

@_date: 2017-03-18 04:28:59
We've already compromised as much as is technically possible. We gave the bigblockers *everything* they were asking for (2 MB blocks). Then they moved the goalposts to an impossible demand (no limit).


Segwit *is* on-chain scaling, to 2-3 MB.


Not possible. The community has rejected it. Developers are just as powerless to force a hardfork as anyone else. It would also be terribly unsafe, and almost guarantee Bitcoin turns into PayPal 2.0 (and unlike Roger, many of us can't afford to risk this scenario and simply write-off our Bitcoin investment, hoping an altcoin provides a viable replacement).


Uhh, you sound like you should be fighting larger blocks tooth-and-nail... even 1 MB blocks today are posing a serious threat to Bitcoin's ongoing survival.

Miners are forced to centralise block relay, which enables censorship and centralised control of who is allowed to mine. Note this is already *almost* true today: miners who do not use the centralised block relay network are de facto penalised in measurably lower income (higher stale block rate).
Note that this outcome is a result from *average nodes* failing to relay the blocks in a timely manner. It is *not* just miners who need to meet this block-relay time requirement in order to avoid this outcome.

The difference is that everyone has to pay the same price for GPUs.

Core cannot decide hardforks. They necessarily require consent from the entire community.

Hardforks cannot be pushed through. Nobody has the ability to force a minority to accept it.

Extension blocks aren't softforks, but behave fairly similarly. Definitely at least as much implementation and testing work as segwit. Frankly, I'd prefer a hardfork over extension blocks normally.
An optional (*insecure*) extension block might make sense in this case, but there's really no reason to think BU fanatics will go for it.

Litecoin is a scam in the first place. It's not realistic to assume Bitcoin will go the same way.

Segwit is just a softfork, so you're fine.

It's getting harder though. I wouldn't expect it to be really practical until ~2050 (if we don't reduce block sizes).

They can certainly be shut off, just not hijacked.

This was the case in an earlier draft, but I proposed a way to fix this a few weeks ago and I think it is being put in the updated code/BIPs.


Oh, so like the old "discouraged blocks" idea? You're right, that won't *break* consensus, but it will make consensus more difficult for the network to settle on, resulting in more blocks before transactions can be considered confirmed.

You won't *have* segwit inputs unless you understand it.

It is impossible to hardfork without ~100% agreement from the community. Attempting to do so without it just creates an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:20:48




No. Bitcoin implementations must all enforce the block size limit. If they don't, it's a security-risk bug. Bitcoin was never meant to be governable, and is designed to be governance-resistant.

I think a PoS approach would be helpful, but it's not very simple. Traditional signed messages have security risks, and don't work for newer wallets.
It wouldn't be voting, though. Hardforks need consensus, not merely a majority.

Nobody can force you or anyone else to use BU. Their niche will just spawn an altcoin, and Bitcoin can move on without them.
We already tried compromise (multiple times), and they moved the goal posts.
It's time to just ignore them.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:05:54
Yes. Or government/regulation.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:47:55
Here's my analysis:
1. The best-case scenario is equivalent to a miner-activated softfork.
2. The worst-case scenario is less risky than an equivalent hardfork. (It's nearly the same, but with a strong economic incentive on miners to cooperate. Users have no incentive nor reason to cooperate with a miner-forced hardfork.)
3. This kind of initiative IMO needs to be championed by users, *not* by developers.
4. Miner activation works well, and we should be able to use it. Miners refusing to upgrade in the face of widespread community support is essentially an attack on the network, and we shouldn't stand for that. UASF ignores the real problem here.
5. Even if miners *weren't* hostile or attacking, the fact that mining is so centralised is itself a huge problem for Bitcoin. Fixing this would automatically fix the issue with hostile miners. So it would be ideal to just fix this root of the problem, rather than do a UASF.
All that being said, I'm going to remain neutral on whether to do a UASF or not. It's up to the rest of the community to decide how to approach dealing with segwit, hostile miners, and mining centralisation.

Back then, nobody had given serious thought to whether there were problems with increasing it. There was also still hope SPV would be possible (turns out it wasn't), which would have made it safe for only a minority to run full nodes.

1. A minimum of 85% of all nodes should be full nodes.
2. No single entity should control more than 10% of the network hashrate.
3. No entire nation should control more than 30% of the network hashrate.

That would be fairly complicated to implement. Remember that Bitcoin only spends entire coins (UTXOs) at once. Also keep in mind that some pools (Eligius and p2pool notably) split the generated coins directly to miners, so these would be small amounts already.

There's no reason someone who wants immediate would be opposed to allowing it in 7 years. That's just silly.
No, the reason it was rejected was because it increased the block size with a hardfork at all.

Making the algorithm more complicated doesn't stop ASICs, it just makes them more difficult. That means *when* someone makes an ASIC, they are much more likely to have a monopoly.


1. 5 years is too long for this. It likely wouldn't even have an impact.

@_date: 2016-01-08 16:52:59
Looks to me like this would destroy the *purpose* of mining in the process...
The safe way to "SPV mine" is:
1. Be able to switch back to the old block if the new one is determined to be invalid (*not possible* with current miners)
2. Never *publish* a block found SPV mining, until you have completed verification of the block it is built on top of (and it is determined to be valid).
BTCC's pool did not significantly harm Bitcoin during the BIP66 adoption despite their "SPV mining" *because* they implemented policy 2. Without policy 1, they continued to *waste hashpower* until the next block, but that mostly only affected their own income/relevance, and would be no different than if they had simply shut off their miners for that time period. With both, the Bitcoin network would actually benefit for the reasons laid out by Sergio, but without the problems of "SPV mining".
@_date: 2017-03-01 08:06:24
Which is basically all the developers. (If you want to take Classic/BU/XT garbage seriously, they're just a few exceptions.)

@_date: 2017-03-21 06:21:28
For non-protocol changes, it tends to be developer majority, sometimes influenced by politics. If there's no clear majority, generally it is rejected. Some poor outcomes have occurred this way, but it usually works okay. When someone cares enough about a rejected feature, it can go into Knots or another fork (which are encouraged).
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:33:22
Hardly semantic nittery, if you're leading people to a false conclusion that soft-hardforks are softforks, or (less bad) that they behave the same as typical hardforks.

Core's UI is the only decent one I've seen in any wallet I've tried...
Simple speed tests measure burst speeds, and don't take into account monthly limits. Additionally, just because someone *can* upload 1 MB blocks (note it's upload speed, not download, that matters here - and uploading multiple times needs to be the norm), doesn't mean they want to dedicate a substantial portion of their bandwidth to Bitcoin.
P.S. Is there a particular reason you used testmy.net, a website I've never heard of?

1. I'm not a proponent of UASF.

@_date: 2017-03-08 19:56:42


That's not true; they found several blocks in January. Yes, their webpage is down as a temporary matter, but note that the pool started without any webpage, and it being down hasn't affected the hashrate.
I've heard privately from others that they also use coin-age priority, but being that they are solo miners even smaller than Eligius, they didn't feel like they would make a difference.


What their stated goal was, would have been better served by using priority. I can only guess that they were unaware of it, or had been fed misinformation discouraging them from using it.


When was this? It was optimised some time ago, and I see no reason to think it would have gotten slower since.

You can run a full node without relaying stuff.

There is no maintained software for anything other than Bitcoin as-is, Segwit, and BU. BIP 109 has been abandoned by all its (developer) proponents.




Yes it is. If a block is 1 byte larger than 1 MB, all full Bitcoin nodes will reject it as invalid no matter how much hashrate supports it.

Send out a hitman to kill whom? No one person can make a hardfork on their own. It requires consensus within the economy.
@_date: 2016-01-28 23:34:20




Just because someone owns title to some bitcoins does not make them a user of Bitcoin the consensus system. Those who don't run full nodes of their own could do everything they do with their bitcoins, with any fiat currency.
Also, there are over 10,000 *listening* full nodes, and even more which cannot accept incoming connections.




Every node still needs to download and process that data to get to the current state. Pruning only saves on storage, which is only a limitation on phones. However, phones typically have very low transfer limits, and since no full node software supports SPV mode yet, the number of people running such a node on their phone are few.
@_date: 2016-01-25 21:49:57
There are literally no benefits to using a hardfork rather than a softfork. A softfork is safer, quicker, and allows for partial opt-in. Hardforks are necessarily dangerous, slow and difficult to coordinate, and must be adopted by 100% of the users or not at all.
Oh, and note there is also (c) misunderstanding one or both of the proposals. This appears to have been the case for a number of Classic supporters.

Yes and no. There is only one block format, which is basically the same as it always has been. But old nodes don't know to skip the witness when calculating the txid, so updated nodes need to lie to them, and send an incomplete copy of the block with segwit witnesses stripped out. This isn't really another block format, though, just a trick to make it backward compatible.

Uh, no? 2 MB is always 2 MB.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:33:36
1. Any other increase besides segwit is a hardfork. Hardforks require consensus. A significant number of Bitcoin users oppose any such a block size increase, so it is impossible.
2. 1 MB is already too large.

You haven't presented an argument to refute... There's no reason to just assume any new thing (especially not something designed for decentralisation like Lightning) will lead to centralisation.
Lightning is particularly centralisation-resistant because to even *attempt* to centralise traffic, you'd need to match the funds of every other peer you connect to. So instead of banking's normal fractional (&lt;100%) reserve, they'd need to be double-reserve (~200%).

Good thing I never said that.


A hardfork is an altcoin which the entire community adopts as "Bitcoin 2.0". If any substantial portion of the economy sticks to the current Bitcoin, the hardfork has failed, and merely created a new altcoin.

@_date: 2016-06-06 15:12:44
The max block size with Segwit is already nearly 4 MB. If a hardfork increases the size available to old/pre-witness transactions to 2 MB, that wouldn't necessarily have an effect on the size available to witness transactions.

And SPV simply does not exist.

Arguably the integrity of the system is already mostly gone simply due to economies of scale. :/
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:03:35
Yes and no. Not really, because a block is more than *just* data - it is data that must be verified and replicated across many thousands of computers worldwide within a matter of seconds, and the sum of all which must be downloaded and processed by every new user at least once.
@_date: 2016-06-11 19:15:49
No, because unless you run your own node, you are not adopting Bitcoin itself, but merely trusting someone else who does.
@_date: 2019-03-14 11:12:29
Bloom filters are only one of now 3 protocols for "SPV" (which isn't real SPV - that doesn't even exist).
Neutrino and Stratum are also "SPV"
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:36:58
Not necessarily. A hardfork could be designed such that it respects that it needs consensus from the entire community.
For example, activation similar to BIP 9, but with miners expected to respect only consensus measured by a functional stake-polling system, with two activation paths to protect against false activation. So everyone owning bitcoins would indicate in their wallet if they consent and have upgraded to HF-capable code, and everyone could see how much of the total bitcoin issuance had indicated this. Miners would then activate a config setting to signal the block version bit and trigger the HF. When the HF is triggered, *only* nodes which had been told by their owners to consent will switch to the new rules, while any nodes which the owner indicated denial/veto would trigger a switch to an alternative PoW system (since obviously the original PoW has become untrustworthy). Nodes which hadn't indicated either way could freeze until the user consented or vetoed the hardfork.
Would that be acceptable?
@_date: 2016-01-26 00:42:21
Hmm, is the background some Photoshop template? I wonder if it is copyrighted itself...
@_date: 2016-01-25 03:01:37


There is no evidence the majority support this specific proposal. Note that Core is planning on a block size increase to ~2 MB within a few months.
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:17:53
There's no simple way. And because BU doesn't have anti-replay, you *can't* just clone the wallet as others here are suggesting - if you do, you'll be sending the same tokens on both networks at the same time, because BU reuses all the existing UTXO serial numbers.
I imagine when/if BU splits off, someone will make a way to do it, but there's no way to prepare for it today.
cc @_date: 2017-03-11 21:13:36
No, it was predicated on them having the majority *hashrate*, which is controlled by only a few people, much less than 1% (which is itself a serious problem for Bitcoin, even if they weren't hostile).
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:00:51
Yes, but it is clear there is no community will for a HF block size increase at this time. Even this minimally invasive proposal was rejected.
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:30:37
Who? 2MB+SW is still what Core is deploying.

But it's *not* agreed upon.


@_date: 2017-03-27 11:30:23
51% attacks refer to things that are valid, and therefore would be accepted by all nodes. If it's invalid, then it wouldn't relay, and wouldn't be considered a 51% attack.

There's lots of kind of forks.
**Software fork** - Program A is taken and modified to form Program B.
**Softfork** - Bitcoin protocol has new rules added to enable new functionality.
**Altcoin** - Bitcoin protocol has existing rules removed or changed to form a new protocol.
**Hardfork** - Bitcoin protocol has existing rules removed or changed to form a new protocol. Existing currency holders are preserved. By the community's agreement/consent, this new protocol will replace the current one and become Bitcoin.
**Attempted hardfork** - Altcoin that aspires to be a hardfork.
**Chain split/fork** - Altcoin that preserves currency holders from the point where it split off of Bitcoin.
BU is an *attempted hardfork* implemented by a *software fork* of Bitcoin Core, but without community consent, so is likely to remain an *altcoin* with a *chain split* and not actually become a real *hardfork*.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:15:49
Is it even *possible* to sue an entire class of people (ie, all Bitcoin users) in most jurisdictions, even if you have an argument? I realise the opposite is true (a class action lawsuit), and there's conspiracy criminal charges, but those don't seem like they'd apply here?
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:32:57


There is, but the small blockers are basically disenfranchised at this point.
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:28:01
Don't attribute your cluelessness to me being delusional. Miners are not a group relevant to L0 consensus (which is what decides hardforks).

It's important to not let the size grow faster than the ability for new nodes to sync it.
Basically we really need a block size decrease to 300k. No good solution for this yet.

Miners can't pull off a hardfork, so no.

Your source is unsourced. Just over 2 MB is expected for typical usage today.
3 MB would require more complex transactions, but I think those could potentially become the norm when Lightning and/or sidechains get widespread usage.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:57:45
If you use a non-segwit transaction, you are consenting to have the txid malleated like this. The problem is that right now, people don't have a *choice* to disable third-party malleability.
Note that no matter how you disallow legacy transactions, doing so would literally be theft.
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:10:29
1. The *publicly admitted* mining alone shows it is centralised.
2. Because they're usually talking about CPU/GPU mining, which is worthless in every respect (not just making money), and even new ASIC miners should be informed up front that it is an *expense*.

I'm mainly looking at the Constraints section, which doesn't account for this at all still (or is way off).
Other issues:
* Internet costs don't always scale by usage; if I pay $50/mo, that's $50/mo regardless of usage. Same goes for the rest of the costs to an extent.
* I suspect your hop timing doesn't account for validating the block.
* Lifetime cost for computer doesn't take into account that hardware doesn't last forever.
@_date: 2016-06-28 12:54:52
Segwit already does that, no HF needed.
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:47:56
At least 0.4 I think. IIRC earlier versions closed the database at shutdown, so you could just copy it out *iff* you cleanly closed the software. It has never been safe/reliable when the program was closed uncleanly or actively running, however.

The biggest problem with Neutrino is that it's being portrayed as a way to use Lightning *without* a full node.
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:42:17
The miner receives all the fees. There are two kinds of pools:
1. Some pools merely coordinate agreements between miners, and the miners pay each other directly. Shares include proofs that the miner is sending the reward to other participants. The only two still-operating examples of this I know of are Eligius and p2pool.
2. Most pools are the miner themselves, and receive the full reward. Later, they pay the contributing miners for their work.
In both cases, the exact algorithm used to decide how to split up the reward (subsidy + fees) is up to the pool implementation.

@_date: 2017-03-24 22:06:24
With an evil fork, the blocks would have data for another chain, and only appear as empty blocks to Bitcoin. It's equivalent to a soft-hardfork, except that the evil fork lacks consensus and tries to suppress its opposition.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:56:07
Bitcoin.org's developer documentation is *often* right (although perhaps not always), and may serve as a good starting point. I'd suggest subscribing to (watching) Bitcoin Core's pull requests, and lurking in the  freenode IRC channel. Don't expect to become an expert overnight (hey, it took us 6 years to get where we are), but all it takes it time really. If you have specific questions, the Bitcoin StackExchange is often a useful resource, and when you're more familiar with the basics, you can ask in  ,  and/or  .
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:50:58
BU won't be satisfied by any sane hardfork, so they're liable to split off regardless.
Besides, miner centralisation is a serious problem no matter what BU/segwit does, and a PoW change is already appropriate even if the network doesn't split. Might as well get it over with.
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:18:34
Only to the extent that the already-established protocol consensus allows it.
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:42:11


Yes, currently the general recommendation is for 95% miner adoption. While technically it only requires a majority, with 50% it is possible for hashrate to shift and risk reversal of the softfork, not to mention that low thresholds virtually guarantee a substantial number of miners being left behind.


The only hardfork ever was on 2013 May 15, scheduled 2013 March 17 following the v0.8.0 altcoin/bug crisis, to remove the newly discovered BDB lock limit rules which effectively prevented blocks larger than ~500k. This was clearly uncontroversial because everyone had previously believed the block size limit to already be 1 MB, and the inadequacy of nodes to handle 1 MB blocks was not yet known. The short time-frame was deemed adequate because the crisis had effectively broken Bitcoin for several hours, and it was impractical that anyone involved in Bitcoin was not alert and watching for a resolution. The hardfork was released in v0.8.1, the same release which fixed the bugs causing the crisis.


For a controversial hardfork with non-trivial/ignorable adoption, it seems likely Bitcoin supporters would sell all their coins on the Classic chain, and Classic supporters would sell all their bitcoins. Thus the price of both would crash, perhaps irrecoverably if it goes far enough to empty the order books. Neutral parties would likely end up selling on both chains to remove their exposure to the risk. Some notable Core developers might quit since their interest in Bitcoin is negated by the ability of such a hostile takeover by a few individuals; this also would reduce confidence in Bitcoin significantly. While my own interest in Bitcoin for Tonal usage is not eliminated by such a radical event, it seems *probable* that Bitcoin would not survive such a thing.
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:49:11


Anyone know how they're supporting core development? (Not saying they're not, just asking how since I was unaware.)


Full nodes don't work that way. What's important is that they be run *locally* and under the physical control of the merchant using them to accept payments. Many nodes run by the same entity is merely a sybil attack on the network.

1. BU's "EC" is inherently unsafe and can never be made safe.
2. BU is not based on the improvements in Segwit.
3. That agreement was violated after mere days by miner(s).
4. Despite that, we upheld our end, and that agreement is concluded.
5. The agreement is explicit that such a hardfork will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community. BU has at most 3% of the community's support.

There is no such thing as a majority or minority fork. For a hardfork, ~100% must agree. If anyone doesn't explicitly consent, then the hardfork fails and becomes an altcoin. The correct behaviour for all Bitcoin nodes, is to remain Bitcoin nodes until their owner chooses otherwise.
@_date: 2016-06-04 21:12:19
Miners can't do hardforks, only softforks. I don't think a price dive is likely to get community consensus for a hardfork either. Nor do I see any reason the price will dive, for that matter, even if segwit takes longer to activate. I also don't think segwit will take that long, since miners are accountable to the community at least indirectly.

I only consider things spam if the purpose isn't sending bitcoins from one person to another (or from one wallet to another, within reason).
A possible start for that wiki page might be...
A genuine transaction is created when someone wants to send bitcoins to someone else; this is consented to by all nodes, since it is the purpose and proper use of the system. A spam transaction is created for other purposes, which may or may not have consent from some nodes, but certainly not from all nodes.
Some common examples of spam transactions:
* Joe wants the block size limit increased, so he repeatedly "sends" himself bitcoins to bloat block sizes and claim that blocks are full.
* Joe doesn't know how to do proof-of-existence, so he sends "transactions" to invalid addresses that he knows how to translate back into his data.
* Joe wants to be hipster and use *blockchain technology*, so he encodes his data as "transactions" to invalid addresses and thinks that makes it "blockchain-based".

TBC hasn't changed since 2011, and the code for it was written in 2012. It's not like these things need ongoing development.
Even if you don't use Knots yourself, you still benefit from the testing that eventually gets its features merged into Core.
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:30:49
De facto, the current block sizes (not quite 1 MB yet) are directly and observably harming Bitcoin. Miners are dependent on a centralised and censorable relay network. Node count continues to drop as more people are unable to provide the resources required (mainly bandwidth) or wait the long multi-day IBD times (which continues to grow despite optimisations). Etc.

Both are the same. The network is failing now: it is centralised, censorable, and many potential users are forced to trust real nodes instead of participating with their own node.

I'm not describing archival nodes, but regular full nodes that must be the norm on the network for Bitcoin to work. Saying "get better bandwidth" isn't a solution - most people don't even have that *option*, and it's Bitcoin that is harmed the most by them not doing so.

@_date: 2017-03-11 05:58:08
You don't get any of Bitcoin's benefits (trustless, secure, etc) if you don't run a full node. Might as well be using PayPal, except instead of PayPal, you're trusting a random person.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:05:26
Please *don't*. Miners should be soft limiting to 750k *at most* right now, or at least setting fee requirements reasonably high to exclude all the spam (which will also result in blocks &lt;750k). The blockchain is growing way too fast, and more and more people are being cut off from Bitcoin.

If the community decides to switch to Keccak, that's a hardfork, not an alt. ;)

Consensus, not mere supermajority, can change anything with a hardfork. If there's consensus, then it doesn't matter how "intrinsic" things are in practice (although I agree with you at an ethical level, and would refuse to give my consent toward consensus for some things).
@_date: 2016-06-27 18:47:47
We never agreed to do a hardfork, only to write the code and propose it to the community. It's not our decision to make whether to deploy that code or not.

Your position contradicts your "why". It is the "bigger blocks now via hardfork" position that demands centralised governance, and the "hardforks always require consensus" position that opposes any governance.

Almost. It could hypothetically be broken by nobody assenting to it, as almost occurred during the Arian crisis.
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:29:22
Just verifying the top block matches is *NOT* sufficient. I could just as well give you that same "top block" with a bogus UTXO set including 42MBTC owned by me... and you could never know (unless you download the entire blockchain and compare).
Unfortunately, Bitcoin's security model relies on at least a supermajority of payments using a "100% pure" full node (unless someone figures out a way to make *real* SPV work, which currently seems impossible).
I do think a temporary semi-SPV mode while the IBD goes on in the background is a good solution though.
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:24:53
Hmm, that's an interesting idea. Thinking of trying it?
@_date: 2016-06-11 19:13:05
Yes and no. Wallet.dat is a BDB database. Bitcoin Core leaves it always open for speed - this means that **the wallet.dat file in your data directory is not sufficient to access your bitcoins**; you also need the "database" subdirectory next to it. When you create a backup using the "Backup Wallet" menu option, however, Core will close the database before it makes the copy, leaving you with a clean single-file wallet.dat - that copy is sufficient on its own. Note that in all cases, your backups need to be updated regularly, at least every 90-100 transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:36:04
I'm not deciding, merely observing.
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:01:20
Problem is, you can't know they sent bitcoins to that address.

Wallets have a balance, but wallets consist of a lot more than a single keypair. These days, it's typically a private key + LOTS of addresses + metadata like transaction dates and notes.
@_date: 2016-06-11 19:15:14
You are wrong. The block chain is not actually a ledger, and addresses do not even exist at the block chain level. Bitcoins never come from an address at all, in any case.
The block chain stores transactions consuming discrete coins ("UTXOs"), and producing new ones that include a short program specifying the conditions they can be redeemed. There are no balances at all.
Also: it is terrible advice to ever use an online wallet.
@_date: 2016-06-28 00:19:20
All of this has been clarified since the first time we became aware of the confusion in the community on them. Anyone paying attention has no excuse for being ignorant of them, and I have no idea how someone actually at the meeting could have come away with such a complete misunderstanding especially on the "VERY clear" points.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:22:16
There is a reasonable effort to discourage unsafe practices like single-key paper "wallets".
Get a HD wallet setup.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:08:41
That would be a softfork, and we'd need to identify the stolen bitcoins first.
A hardfork would be restoring those bitcoins to MtGox control and/or their owners.
@_date: 2019-03-14 17:05:33
Not presently.
I think rather than remove Bloom, we should make it only available to authenticated peers (ie, your own mobile wallets). When/if Stratum gets added, we can do the same.

@_date: 2016-06-17 23:37:13
Not to mention set a terrible precedent. You'd have people making up real or bogus "my coins were stolen, return them to me!" hardfork proposals on a regular basis.
@_date: 2016-06-06 04:03:12
That probably means you have a hardware problem. Not safe to put a wallet on a computer that's liable to malfunction anyway, so be glad Core caught it early on...

If majority of miners go off to some altcoin, there is no reason to assume Bitcoin users will abandon Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-05 20:28:18
Less of a target than a light client...
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:20:33
It is important that the block propagates to the entire network within a matter of seconds, otherwise miners are forced to use centralised (and censorable) relay networks. 30 seconds is being generous (probably *too* generous) for a single hop.
Edit: Note that at some point, you'll need to factor compact block relay and similar protocols into the math, but the statistical info for that doesn't really exist yet.
A decent IBD requirement would be to maintain a constant (ie, not infinitely growing) IBD time, taking into account improvements in technology. I believe Patrick Strateman did an analysis of this for Scaling Bitcoin last year, and concluded that to avoid infinite growth requires an average block size of 300k. (Obviously this is problematically small, but it's important info to have.)
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:32:00


Sounds like FUD. A large drop in hashrate would actually be *good* for us.

The main cost is the bandwidth required for every Bitcoin user from now until the foreseeable future having to download it. To simply *maintain* the current cost to bootstrap a new node, assuming reasonable technology improvements, we would need blocks to be 300k on average. We *don't* have a viable way to solve that, but at the very least we can try to keep the damage reasonably manageable.
@_date: 2016-06-07 16:07:45
The witness data is still part of the block. Old nodes just get a stripped block, not the full block.

It might be better to do things slower, but too many people want bigger blocks sooner rather than later. 1 MB blocks are already too big for the current network, and compact blocks are necessary to make even these viable. SegWit is needed to enable miners to produce larger blocks in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:22:00
Depends on the 1% remnant. Do they constitute an economy? If so, then the original/previous Bitcoin survived, and ethically gets to keep the name.
If not, then the 1% aren't really using the original Bitcoin, and so the hardfork really has 100% and succeeds.

Well, just because we have segwit doesn't mean we have &gt;1 MB blocks. Miners should continue to keep their blocks at or below 1 MB until CB is deployed and confirmed to make larger blocks safer. But in any case, the goal is to release CB &amp; segwit at approximately the same time.

The output script for segwit is &lt;OP_0 through OP_16&gt;&lt;up to N bytes of literal data&gt;
Specifically segwit v0 uses: OP_0 &lt;20 bytes&gt; or OP_0 &lt;32 bytes&gt;
Current nodes on the network do not understand either of these, and will never relay them. (If they see them in a block, they will process as "anyone can spend".)
Segwit nodes will understand only "segwit v0" and will not relay segwit transactions that are not v0. (If seen in a block, non-v0 segwit will process as "anyone can spend".)

Wallet.dat is a BDB database, and while it is in the data directory, it is left opened for performance; since it is open, it relies on the "database" subdirectory parallel to it for integrity. When a backup is made by the application, it first closes the database before making the copy, to provide a single backup file.
If there's no GUI for this, what you can do is:
1. Run bitcoin.exe -server -rpcpassword=temporary
2. In another console, run bitcoind.exe -rpcpassword=temporary backupwallet "backupwallet.dat"
3. Find backupwallet.dat and copy that somewhere safe.

Bitcoin addresses have always been single use, and when reuse worked, it was essentially by coincidence, not something you should do or rely on. Addresses do not have balances; they only receive payments, never send.
xpub is not an address at all, but a watch-only wallet token that will allow you to observe your wallet without the private key (xpriv). You should generally not share this with other people, and probably never with a website.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:31:01

You are wrong. Segwit doesn't have 1 MB + 3 MB. It simply has up to 4 MB.

@_date: 2017-01-28 19:36:29
It doesn't prove the file is authentic, only that someone had it on a specific date. Furthermore, you don't need to put the hash in the blockchain to do this: it is sufficient to use it when signing a transaction, so the signature itself proves you had the file.

Uh, your conclusions are at least very wrong. That 20 MB block link claims only 0.267 Mbps needed, but the math shows much more: 20 MB * 8 peers / 30 seconds * 8 MB per Mb = 43 Mbps upload
And that's with 30 seconds, which is still probably *much* higher than is reasonable for a decentralised network.
You've also entirely overlooked the IBD requirements.
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:15:50


No reason we can't do both. The block size should ideally be big enough for genuine transactions that want to use the blockchain, and no larger. At the present time, that volume is approximately 650k/block on average (in the past, it was lower).

That's not how Bitcoin works. What is "hashing power"? The protocol defines it in a certain way - it's not merely SHA2 hashing, but SHA2 hashing of data which conforms to a very specific structure. Part of that is the 1 MB block size limit. So if the block data is larger, it is not *any* hashing power at all as far as Bitcoin is concerned.

Softforks are enforced by miners and therefore can be decided by a supermajority % of miners.

Wrong. Upload bandwidth is so easily obtainable that it's negligible of any given node provides it.
What is far more important, is refusing to accept payments until they confirm with your own full node. By doing so, you create the economic pressure enforcing the rules that comprise Bitcoin, and therefore contribute toward the security of Bitcoin as a system.

Yes. First, make a backup with 0.3.19. I don't recall if there's a GUI for this; if not, let me know and I'll try to help with the more complex steps. Do NOT just copy wallet.dat directly; that won't make a proper backup.
After you backup your wallet, uninstall the old version and install the new one. It will need to rebuild some databases, but it should sync up with your old wallet.
Once you've confirmed everything is working, you should run Bitcoin Core with the -upgradewallet option once, to upgrade your wallet to the latest version. This will reduce your transaction fees (not immediately). You may also wish to enable wallet encryption. Update your backups (with the "Backup Wallet" menu option) immediately (and continue to update them every 90 transactions).

No, that is what 2X is pushing. It is contentious. Not because of Core, but because it is absurdly unsafe and on an insane schedule. But most of all, because those promoting 2X have made *zero effort* to convince the community to consent to it.


BIP148 is what got Segwit. Nobody is backing away from BIP148. On the contrary, the few devs who had serious reservations about BIP148 have accepted that it was a complete success.


They committed to a hardfork with 2 MB blocks. 2X is 8 MB instead. Their good faith has been violated, and they have no obligation to support 8 MB blocks just because they agreed to 2 MB.


No. Miners don't make these decisions in the first place.

The Catholic Church teaches that public heretics are strictly ineligible to become pope under any conditions, explicitly including the case where they have unanimous support from all the cardinals, and even if the heresy is not formally declared as such. Heresy is the rejection of any formally defined doctrine of the Church, many of which Francis publicly teaches against (for example: salvation through other religions; capital punishment being moral; reception of the Holy Eucharist by active adulterers; etc). As such, faithful Catholics are obliged to reject Francis's claim to be pope. [This Q&amp;A by Bishop Sanborn]( may be informative.

Bitcoin development is *way* "understaffed", which is why most of us focus on the protocol itself, rather than usability.

Well, there's the possibility of leeching nodes that only download blocks and don't participate in the relaying. This just can't be the norm - the typical node needs to participate reasonably well.


30s is 5% of 600, so miners would have 5% stale blocks if that was the total block propagation time for the network. This gets worse for the anonymous/uncensored miners if other miners use a centralised/censorable relay network.

It increases the resource requirements to use Bitcoin (note: the trustless system / blockchain, NOT merely the currency). 1 MB has proven to be too high for many people.

If non-updated users exist, the protocol change is either malicious or has failed. Soft-hardforks cleanly protect old nodes from exploit while making a clear upgrade path to either the new protocol or continuing on the old one in case it is deployed maliciously (ie, without consent).


That's why MW wouldn't make sense to *replace* Bitcoin, but only as an additional extension block.

Ah, right, I was confusing it with the "head-first [mining]" stuff Classic came up with a few months ago. Yes, the headers-first download did improve the IBD time, but it was a one-time improvement; it doesn't change the fact that IBD time continues to grow.


We don't have that yet, and it wouldn't mitigate the IBD issues (there is no shortage of full archival nodes yet).

Maybe so, but there's still no way the current node software can process such a block. For protocol rules, they need to at least be technically possible for all nodes. This is why a block size limit is inherently necessary, and truly unlimited is impossible (even if it were a good idea).

Segwit already gave a compromise by increasing the block size limit to 2-3 MB. That's already pretty dangerous considering how harmful 1 MB blocks have been.
Furthermore, it's not up to developers to make these decisions. In the middle of the segwit compromise, those of us who want a limit decrease are already being disenfranchised.

Core intentionally has higher testing standards, and only adds new features in X.Y releases (not X.Y.Z). Many of the features will be in 0.14. Others have not had sufficient review yet. If Knots users use some of the less-tested features, it can be helpful if they leave comments on the Core pull requests to that effect to help get them merged.

Tweaking the BIP to pass 1 MB in 2018 Jan might be viable. Do you intend to just abandon the reduction leading up to it, however, and ignore the very real problems that demand the decrease? Hardly a compromise in that case... but still, maybe 2 years out is enough.


This chart shows you don't understand segwit at all. The effective blocksize limit (2-3 MB) with segwit is *less than* the actual blocksize limit (4 MB).
But perhaps more importantly: bip-blksize eliminates this distinction entirely by setting the actual blocksize limit approximately the same as the expected effective block size. So a 1 MB blocksize limit will be 1 MB effectively as well, and so on as it grows.

I'm pretty sure all emergency situations can be resolved with a softfork.

Originally there was an implicit 32 MB limit imposed by the p2p networking code. If that was removed, there would be an inherent 2 GB limit implied by the `size_t` number type on 32-bit systems and a 9 EB limit on 64-bit systems. But since such nodes don't agree on the implied limit (therefore have different consensus protocols), that would mean it would be possible to create a 2 GB + 1 byte block that splits the network between "32-bit Bitcoin" and "64-bit Bitcoin" (consensus failure). Additionally, because nodes store the block deserialised in memory before storing it to disk, blocks which exceed the local system's memory available would crash the node - meaning the system requirements for running a node would also be approximately 2x the implied limit (ie, 18 EB for 64-bit systems).

If it began the same time as the Segwit branch, I suppose it could result in Segwit being an altcoin. Although if the old clients abandoned it when they split, and upgraded to get onto the Segwit chain, that'd be a different scenario.
If miners decided to try this weeks later (eg, today), after the Segwit softfork has been established, it would be a hardfork from the perspective of the current network.

We don't need to. Activation of the new block size limit code proposed can be done at any point before it begins increasing beyond 1 MB - heck, the community could even wait until it reaches the 1 MB point before activating it. This changes the failure case of *other* hardforks from "1 MB forever" to "worst case, block size increases in 2024" (and without making such other hardforks any more difficult).
@_date: 2016-06-06 02:47:21
At present time, there is only enough volume for ~550k/block. Increasing the block size will not magically make more usage appear out of nowhere. On the other hand, Lightning is around the corner, and has the potential to increase volume (by making micropayments practical and affordable) as well as reduce block size needs to only maybe 5-10k/block.
1 MB has *not* worked fine since 2010. Back then, block sizes were *much* smaller, and if blocks were actually 1 MB, the system would have completely failed. Even today, the 1 MB blocks we've been seeing have been *severely degrading* the system. *Hopefully*, Bitcoin Core 0.13 will include compact block relay support, and *hopefully* that will make 1-2 MB blocks safe - but that is yet to be determined in practice.

Right. I don't care about other conditions for a hardfork (whatever they may be), because they're not relevant to what I'm trying to measure. The reason I ask people to comment on such conditions here, is so that I could make future polls to measure how much of an issue each of those are.

v0.14.0  was released with the blockchain at 106 GB.

So that means a 23% increase in the blockchain size in the last 6 months.

Things that we tried to make clear both at the meeting itself, as well as afterward on social media:
1. Core contributors present and party to the agreement were not acting as representatives of the Core dev team, (This was made VERY clear.)
2. There was no hardfork promised (not even all the Core dev team has authority to do that), only code that could be recommended for one. (This also was made VERY clear.)
3. The hardfork proposal promised was not a "2 MB hardfork", but a hardfork that would include as one minor change, the ability to include up to 2 MB of current witness-included-in-txid (anyone-can-malleate) transactions.
4. Miners have no leverage to make demands. If they attempt to hardfork without community consensus, they harm only themselves, while Bitcoin moves on without them. (At least for my part, my goal of the agreement was to end division and argumentation, which did not happen, admittedly not because of the fault of many of the agreement participants.)
5. The July 2016 estimate was not part of the agreement, and certainly not a deadline. It was (at the time) a reasonable expectation based on the agreement terms.
6. Speaking only for myself, I made the promise with sincerity, and intend to uphold it best I can (despite the almost immediate violation by one of the parties).
Admittedly, both at the meeting and now, I consider the "SegWit delayed until HF is released in Core" position some miners took to be unviable, and that miners will be pressured to deploy it much sooner by the community. After all, not deploying segwit literally means they are preventing the block size increase. However, I understand the agreement places no such obligation on them.
Since the agreement was made:
1. SegWit has still not yet been included in a release. Thus the three months deadline has not even begun "counting" yet. (I still aspire to have something by the end of July if possible, but I consider this to be above and beyond the agreed-on terms.)
2. Discussions have revealed that the goal of expanding space for anyone-can-malleate transactions loses the necessary performance improvements included with SegWit to make larger blocks safer, thus cannot safely be done without ugly hacks to introduce new limits similar to BIP 109 which might become a nuisance to Bitcoin both today and in the future. This isn't a show-stopper to writing code, but it may make it difficult to come up with something that unbiased parties can *recommend*.
3. Many third parties have expressed that they will under no conditions consent to a hardfork that comes out of this or any other political agreement. This won't block code nor recommentation, but it does guarantee such a proposal cannot be adopted.
4. Some developer(s) have expressed concerns that doing a hardfork safely ("soft hardfork") is somehow "unethical" to them, and doing it unsafely will require even greater efforts on ensuring consensus is reached not only from the community, but also that there are no nodes accidentally left behind. This isn't a blocker, but it probably makes deployment *much* harder.

With one block per hour. That's more than enough for survival, especially if Lightning (which provides *instant* confirmation off-chain) is fully functioning before then. It might actually be a good thing, since it would effectively reduce block size to ~333k for 3 months (after which the community can decide whether or not to softfork it as a longer-term thing).
But, that aside, it would be fine to change the proof-of-work algorithm. It's not something we should fear, much less a deal-breaker.
It would be stupid to give in to miner bullying regardless. That would probably kill the entire concept of cryptocurrency, and we'd be stuck going back to fiat and gold.


There is no "1x chain", there is just Bitcoin. A hardfork requires consensus to successfully succeed the name "Bitcoin". BCash has already failed to meet that criteria, so it isn't Bitcoin. In the scenario you describe, 2X also fails to meet the criteria, so it also isn't Bitcoin. Then the question becomes whether the remaining community comes to consensus for a PoW change hardfork - if so, that is exclusively the continuation of Bitcoin.

2. Backup the wallet, and copy it to the bigger drive. Note you will overwrite any wallet currently there, so don't do it if both have funds!
3. Dump the private key, and use Bitcoin Knots to sweep it. (Core doesn't support sweeping yet.)
Note that you cannot, at least with new wallets, import private keys, because the new wallets are HD.

You don't open a new channel for each person you do business with. Instead, payments are routed across established channels in a mesh-like formation.
So if you have a channel open with Joe, Joe has a channel open with Fred, Fred has a channel open with Alice, and you want to pay Alice, your payment just makes use of these 3 channels to atomically route your payment to Alice.


Lightning is centralisation-resistant in this regard, since each peer must reserve an equivalent amount of bitcoins to each channel. So for someone to even *try* to be a centralised hub, they would need to match the funds of every peer they inter-connect with. It would be very expensive. And even then, they would gain nothing by doing so: if they charge too high a fee, or attempt to censor payments, people will just transparently route around them.


Before Lightning is usable, Segwit must activate. Segwit increase Bitcoin's block size to 2-4 MB. Additionally, the premise that 50 channels are needed is false.


This assumes no further improvements can be made. Yet such improvements are already in the development pipeline, and it seems probable that more will be invented as Bitcoin improves.


We are increasing to 2-4 MB right now, but that aside, the Bitcoin network cannot realistically handle large blocks today. It is already causing irrepairable permanent harm to Bitcoin, and is a serious threat to its long-term success. For this reason, a decrease would be wise as soon as we can "afford" to reduce the block size.


Lightning is more than just improved scaling. It also reduces risk significantly by providing instant confirmation of transactions. Bitcoin's current 1 hour confirmation time is too slow for retail, so Lightning effectively enables the retail use case for Bitcoin.


You mean bytes. I don't know what the actual number is, but it is certainly known to Lightning developers by now, since Lightning has been implemented. Smart contracts don't need to be large...


I'm not sure what you're saying here. While I don't think the analogy is very good, the money is no more "tied up" in Lightning than it is in checking accounts. If you have a checking account with a bad actor, you need to settle (in court!) too, which is much slower than dealing with it on the blockchain.

This guy is just a troll. If he says something, most likely the opposite is true.


It's no easier or harder than any other hardfork. It just requires consensus.


Forcing on whom? is the question. If the community wants to force it on miners, they can. If the supermajority of miners wants to force it on &gt;5% of dissenting miners, they can *only with community support*. But in no case should developers take initiative in trying to force the softfork IMO; so it should remain trigger by 95%, and users/miners can use their influence to ensure that 95% is met on the best chain.
I don't think this is necessary, however. If it is, we probably have much bigger problems.

No, a hardfork means there is *NO* split. When someone splits off, that's just how an altcoin is started.
The difference between a hardfork and a softfork is a matter of backward compatibility, and the level of agreement from the community technically required for it to succeed.

The original decentralised mining pool was Bitpenny, which used a modified bitcoind.
GBT pools also offer decentralised mining, but to a much more limited extent: the miner may only choose to reject mining blocks the pool proposes that he disagrees with. Hypothetically, the GBT protocol would allow the miner full customization, but that has never been implemented.

Then you need to get over the retarget period.
And even that won't work, since the hostile miners can reorg to a chain that *does* have &gt;25% during the retarget period... and then you need to compare two different hash algorithms, which is a mess in itself.

Bitcoin itself can be changed in two ways:
- Softforks add new rules to the consensus system. Many things can be done this way by taking a formerly "no op" script and applying a new meaning to it. However, it cannot typically remove restrictions already in place. Softforks can be deployed by a miner supermajority enforcing them.
- Hardforks are essentially a completely new system that everyone agrees to adopt in place of the current Bitcoin. As such, they can change literally anything. But since nobody can be coerced to adopt a new system, the deployment is much more difficult and requires active consent from pretty much everyone using Bitcoin (ie, if you do nothing, you effectively act as a veto on the new system, since the current Bitcoin considers it an attack to route around).
Increasing the supply beyond 21M would necessarily be a hardfork, and is unlikely to be possible since you'd never get consent from everyone. Decreasing it could potentially be a (likely controversial) softfork.
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:58:03
Obviously it would depend on how it was "hacked". Many of us lost a large amount of bitcoins in MtGox, so personal loss is clearly not criteria for doing something stupid. Now, if it were an exploit in Bitcoin itself that made the system unusable, obviously that'd be cause for some change.

I'm not sure why you expect a drop at all. But the drop did happen, once on July 16, resolved by BIP91's activation. And then a small FUD-based drop just before August.

He *didn't* make a fair point, merely lied to you about it not being implemented. The complete production-ready code is [in the pull request](
It wasn't ever assigned a BIP number because it was dead-on-arrival. The community indicated that no block size hardfork, not even one 7 years out, was acceptable.
(Note it's only a block size limit decrease *if* miners activate the new formula prior to the 7 year mark. Including this was necessary for the proposal to be one I could honestly recommend, although I don't recommend the activation of it until the new limit intersects with a reasonable block size limit.)

Not quite. Segwit will make nearly 4 MB possible, but typical blocks will only be 2 MB. So the block size limit is 4 MB, and the block size will be around 2 MB. Saying "not by raising blocksize" is nonsense.

No, nor should it.
It cannot be done, because there is no such thing as "the mempool". Each node has its own mempool, managed as the node operator chooses. Some nodes might not have any mempool at all - and this is inherently always the case (at least effectively) for nodes that were not online when the block was found.
It *should not* be done, because empty blocks still help the network, and the alternative to empty blocks may very well be an attack on the network.
@_date: 2016-11-20 18:55:52




Okay, I think I can agree with that. Segwit doesn't do that, however. And downloading the signatures is in itself worthless - they need to be verified. Clients that won't verify them don't benefit in the slightest from downloading them.

Reasoning doesn't have opposites. I will quite often argue for both opposing sides, but that's not hypocrisy, just critical thinking.
Downvotes on reddit are only supposed to be used in the same situations where a reasonable mod is justified in intervening.
Part of why I assumed you were ban evading was that I didn't have *any* RES tag for you (which I usually at least use to link notable past interactions, even if not flagging trolls)  - but maybe it was just so long ago that I hadn't installed RES yet.
And obviously you weren't *permanently* banned, if you've been unbanned...

@_date: 2017-08-10 09:36:24
You are correct. But you're assuming we're talking about valid blocks. Valid blocks are valid even if you don't check them at all. ;)
The only time the security level of your node matters is when it encounters an *invalid* block. And in this case, your failure to check the Segwit transaction compromises your entire node, even if it only cares about transactions with no Segwit in their history.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:35:48
No such thing.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:39:38
No, it's because softforks are superior to hardforks in deployment safety, and there's no reason to do a hardfork when you can do a cleaner softfork.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:14:35




That's not true.
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:02:40


There was no stalemate. BIP148 was deployed. *That's* how we got Segwit.
NYA was just face-saving efforts from the miners.


Nobody else agreed to any compromise, nor was there any reason to. The community has the right and power to enforce whatever rules we collectively want, with or without permission from the miners.


No, it doesn't. Your link is miners' opinions. Miners have no say in hardforks.
For a hardfork to succeed, the entire community must at least consent to it. Right now, at least a majority of the community opposes 2X.


That's what the NYA said, yes. But then Jeff Garzik wrote 2X *as an 8 MB hardfork instead*. So even the few companies who agreed to NYA have no obligation to deploy 2X, because it goes far beyond what they agreed to.


No, we have Segwit because of BIP148.


Nobody ever consented to 2X in the first place. It's not being abandoned, it's being rejected outright from the start. The only potential cause of division are people who want to split off and do 2X anyway, despite the lack of consensus.


Are you going to carry around one more phone every year? Anyhow, see above point about 2X being 8 MB.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:30:05
VPS are not under your exclusive control. The host (or anyone compromising them) can quietly make your node lie to you. See also the Linode incident.

2X is an altcoin, and won't launch until November (if ever). Altcoins are off-topic here.
If you mean Segwit, then it can send fine, but if your node is very old (before 0.13.1), you will lose full node security until you upgrade. If you use pruning, you will need to re-sync from scratch unless you upgrade within the next 3 days.

That is yet to be seen for sure, and rather unlikely in the near future. Furthermore, the network today is not ready for it.

I run the [bitcoin-seeder network crawler]( and it sees ~11k active listening nodes. The raw data is [recorded daily on GitLab]( and goes back to 2012 June (beware, several GBs).
As far as the charts go, each one shows the percentage of these nodes that advertise support for a specific network service. Archive nodes provide the full blockchain available for download. Get-UTXO nodes provide UTXO lookup services used by the (long dead, I imagine) Lighthouse crowdfunding app. Bloom nodes provide filtering services for some popular light clients. Segwit nodes understand full segwit blocks and transactions. Xthin nodes support BU's "Xthin block relay" protocol. And finally full-RBF nodes support unconditional replace-by-fee (ie, with or without opt-in flags).
I have no idea how Bitnodes gets their info, but it seems clearly incomplete.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:47:13
1. Quantum doesn't hurt SHA2 much.
2. SHA256 and SHA384 are both SHA2.
3. SHA2 isn't encryption, it's cryptographic hashing.
4. Segwit upgrades P2SH from RIPEMD160 to SHA256.
5. Quantum computers probably won't be a real threat any time soon.

The stance on heliocentrism and evolution have always been the same: that these are matters of science, and should be studied scientifically.

No, it isn't. Not until the blocks start getting full (and even then there are some viable possibilities to make it work squeezing the last bit of space out). But once we move to Lightning, block sizes ought to drop quite a bit.

If they're still valid, simply leaving Bitcoin Core open will eventually rebroadcast them (unpredictably, to avoid people knowing you received them). If the fee is too low, you may have an issue even then, however.

Do not use an "API".
Do not use Electrum.
Do not trust it after merely 10 minutes.
When you are accepting payments of bitcoins, use only local full node software such as Bitcoin Core or Knots, and wait for the transaction to have at least 8-10 "confirmations" before you irreversibly deliver your product (if you can reverse your product, such as by cancelling a monthly service, just accept the payment immediately and check if you need to cancel later).

blockchain_size * tech_improvement_per_year / number_of_blocks_per_year =
 max_block_size to maintain the current technological cost
So if we plug in the numbers today:
150 GB * 17% / 52596 = 485 kB
Not long ago, we were at only 100 GB, however. To maintain the costs back then, we'd need:
100 GB * 17% / 52596 = 323 kB
The last time we had sufficient percentage of full nodes, was probably closer to 30 or 40 GB:
40 GB * 17% / 52596 = 129 kB

@_date: 2017-08-21 14:29:29
Running a node is too expensive, and with Segwit increasing the block size to 2-4 MB, it's going to get rapidly more expensive - it will probably *double* in the next year. This is far more concerning than transaction fees, especially since we can reduce those by actually improving Bitcoin.
Technology to handle blocks improves only about 17% each year, so our current block size will outpace what *anyone* can handle very quickly.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:34:03

We've already found that 1 MB alone is already significantly stressing the network and leading to serious centralisation. 2-4 MB isn't going to be any less bad.

There's only one Bitcoin blockchain at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:21:16


Nope, that only works for softforks and safe/soft-hardforks (which Segwit2x is not), and even then, it doesn't work if a substantial part of the community actively *opposes* the change.


Segwit itself increases the block size to 2-4 MB. You mean Segwit w/ 2-4 MB vs Segwit w/ 4-8 MB? I suppose that'd be ridiculous, but still less ridiculous than *only* the 4-8 MB variant.


Only if you value those altcoins.

No, it can't reduce spam. Right now, a 1 MB block is typically ~100-300k of spam. Once blocks are 2 MB, that would mean they can be up to 1.1-1.3 MB spam instead. It's strictly worse. And spamming 100-300k will cost less, since it doesn't need to outbid as many legit transactions.

If you want to get mined in the very next block, you need to pay a fee that *all* miners will accept. That means it only takes one small miner to require a high fee, to bump up the fee needed to ensure this.
When you target the next 3 blocks, your wallet knows it can ignore up to 66% of the highest-fee-required miners.

SHA2 is no longer a proof-of-work algorithm, but has become assigned-by-Jihan; it now has the problems the whitepaper warned about in regard to using IP addresses.

Full node users aka Bitcoin users. Without a full node, you're not using Bitcoin-the-system at all, merely trusting someone else who does to act as a middle-man for you to use bitcoins-the-currency.
Miners can require any minimum fees they want or need to stay in business. Since each on-chain Lightning settlement represents multiple transactions, users can afford to pay more per byte.

Rules were tightened in March, and then released completely in May. But it's unclear if anyone generated a block since then that would trigger the splitting conditions.


Yes, I think you are correct. I'm not confident we can reliably undo it at this point, however... the exact application of the issue was never fully investigated once a solution was found. As you say, the reversal would need to be more than sufficient to cover all cases v0.8.0+ violated. It would need to be a softfork even from the perspective of v0.7.2, however, since the original behaviour was not deterministic.


I don't know about "most others", but I believe you are correct that nullc does not consider it a hardfork.


I suspect if we were to seriously debate it, we would come to a common agreement on this, but it really isn't worth the time to do so at this point IMO.

2. Whether the world is flat or spherical is not a matter of faith or morals, so is within the realm of private opinion, not revelation or religion.


It's the only logical conclusion if you concede that God Himself revealed those teachings as absolutely true. Updating them necessarily would imply they were wrong before (or otherwise wrong after). Furthermore, why would a mere man ever know better than God?


Okay, fair point. The answer is that God guaranteed His Church would teach His doctrine correctly.

Bitcoin only works if users are running their own full nodes and making informed decisions about what software/rules to use for that.
So step 1 is to make sure you're running your own full node, and using it for your wallet. Until you do this, you have no real control over your bitcoins (and maybe don't have any bitcoins either).

If we assume the blockchain is 100 GB, and blocks are on average 1 MB, that would be a growth rate of 53% in a year. Technology improvement is about 17%. With segwit doubling block size, we'll be growing 100 GB per year.

Segwit is a softfork, not a hardfork. But yes, if it doesn't achieve widespread agreement, miners should not activate it, and under no conditions should it activate with less than 95% of miner signalling.

@_date: 2016-11-05 14:58:51

The reason for contention is irrelevant (and your claims here completely wrong anyway). The fact that contention exists prevents any hardfork.


They released code that breaks from the consensus protocol.


Bandwidth availability has not increased for most of the world since before Bitcoin was released. But more importantly, it is a fact that 1 MB blocks are presently too large for the network, as evidenced by the increasing centralisation of the network and dropping full node counts.


This is just FUD.

Unsolicited data. In the context of Bitcoin, data which does not represent as its purpose a transfer of value from one entity to another.


We do lots to block it. For example, that whole transaction fee thing really originated as a system to try to block spam (but it only works if blocks are filled by legitimate transactions, and at a higher feerate than spammers will pay - which is much higher than they currently are).

No reason to expect cheaper fees nor faster confirmation. You'll need to upgrade to retain full node security, and when miners finally start making bigger blocks, you'll have up to 4x the resource requirements to run the node. When you upgrade to a Lightning-capable wallet, that will probably drop fees, but Lightning isn't segwit.

Tried that a few years ago. The community rejected it (partly because it was planned privately), and miners ignored it rather than following up with comment and further direction.
But why are you suggesting this? Miners have no say in hardforks. The only reason to work something out with them is politeness (which the monopolistic miner frankly no longer deserves at this point).


We're already doing an immediate increase to 2-4 MB with Segwit in a few weeks...

* Full node count and percentage are at an all-time low. If you ask people why they don't run a node, the reason is often tied to the block size.
* Miners are de facto cheating by skipping the very validation that is a crucial part of their job. This breaks the little security light clients had. The cause for this is the time it takes to verify large blocks.
* Mining requires membership in a centralised backbone (Matt's relay network) in order to not take huge losses due to stale rate as large blocks take time to cross the p2p network. Centralised backbones like this are inherently not permissionless, and can be censored.
* Even with the centralised backbone, colluding major pools are de facto performing 51% attacks on the rest of the miners, as an accidental result of the above conditions caused by too-large blocks.
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:57:31

If segwit isn't good enough for you, we can re-propose it without the block size limit increase.
@_date: 2016-11-05 05:36:44
Even with 1 MB blocks, a large chunk of that space is spam. It seems likely that as soon as miners increase their block sizes, they will be filled immediately. So yes, it will affect decentralisation, and miners should keep their blocks smaller until we actually need more space.
@_date: 2016-11-20 05:38:35
I'm not sure what you're asking. Segwit as currently proposed *includes* bigger blocks. Now that the other side has been given 2 MB block size limit with segwit, they've shifted the goalposts and begun to demand unlimited block sizes.

Best I can do is a dedicated output for the fee-difference, with a currently-undefined script that can be redeemed either by the owner (as change) or the miner if certain conditions are met.

If 5% reject the hardfork proposal, it is no longer a hardfork, but an altcoin.


That scenario's no different than any other hardfork.

1. Cost to join the network. Technology improvements have historically only been sufficient to keep up with the growing cost of joining the network if we limit the average (not max) block size to 300k. Otherwise, the time to perform the initial sync will grow unbounded (ie, even accounting for tech. improvements).
2. Cost to be part of the network. Many people have shut down their full nodes because the cost of keeping it running has grown too much for them.
Bitcoin's essential security as a decentralised network relies on at least ~85% of the economy using full nodes they run themselves, and as a result mainly of these two causes, we are likely far below this level today.

With a "normal" hardfork, old nodes are left insecure as their default behaviour is to reject the hardfork. For comparison, with a softfork, the default behaviour is to accept it.
A soft-hardfork is constructed in such a manner so that the default behaviour of old nodes is to simply *stop until a decision is made* by the user. The user can trivially choose to reject the soft-hardfork, or upgrade to accept it, so there is no coercion (unlike an "evil fork" which tries to make rejection difficult).

You couldn't use back references for wallets, since they might be spending unconfirmed coins or the blockchain reorg'd. So these compression changes are really two steps:

ASIC-resistant is NOT a good attribute for a PoW algorithm. ASIC resistance simply means making the ideal ASIC is harder, and therefore a monopoly once someone does it. For example, SHA256d with ASICBoost is an example of an ASIC-resistant algorithm - that's half the problem with our current situation.
Instead, what we should be aiming for is either a readily-available ASIC (eg, a truly memory-based algorithm, which doesn't exist to date), or at least an algorithm for which the best possible ASIC is simple and straightforward to produce, so it is easy to compete in the production of it (and therefore hard to monopolise).

Would someone exploit them on Litecoin, knowing that by not doing so, they could exploit it on Bitcoin instead?
Also, segwit is a very minor change in comparison to the poor design in Ethereum. The flaw in Ethereum was also so obvious that anyone with a background in even unrelated CS areas could have pointed it out (I didn't because I didn't bother looking at Ethereum's specific design until it was exploited). If they had even simply used the security model of past semi-decentralised programmable systems, the flaw simply wouldn't have existed at all. So I don't really thing this is a relevant comparison to make.
All that being said, I do think it might still be of some value if Litecoin were to deploy segwit first (and I would be fine waiting for it, if Litecoin were to indicate an intention to progress down that road).

@_date: 2016-12-22 05:58:12
Good to see a reasonably informed argument against segwit for once. Here are my refutations:
Malleability is, when it comes down to it, just another word for "double spending". This is precisely the blockchain exists to solve in the first place, and if it were possible to eliminate entirely, we would no longer need a blockchain at all. The actual problem segwit intends to address is *third-party* malleability; that is, someone not a party to the transaction being able to double-spend it. This is possible in some cases provided they meet some constraints: typically, the transaction needs to pay to the same outputs.
But the point here is that the sender(s) can *always* malleate a transaction of their own, simply by resigning it, messing with the change or fees, etc. For this reason, it is meaningless to complain that segwit doesn't provide this protection for all transactions: if the sender wishes the transaction to not be malleated, he simply needs to choose to use a transaction type which isn't vulnerable to malleability. If he doesn't care, then it doesn't matter. For the receiver, there can *never* be any guarantees against malleability until the transaction is solidly confirmed in the blockchain, period; it's perfectly legitimate for wallets to double-spend their unconfirmed sent transactions by combining, coinjoining, increasing fees, etc - in this sense, malleability is not a bug, but an *intended feature*. The only time it is a bug, really, is when there are *multiple* senders agreeing on a sequence of transactions; for a sequence to work, the transaction ids must be set in stone before the first is even signed. **Therefore, segwit completely fixes the problem of inherent third-party malleability.**


The signatures are indeed more expensive to validate, however this is only part of the full picture. The signatures can be *immediately pruned*, while the UTXOs must be stored *indefinitely* until used. The goal of segwit's discount is to properly balance the incentive to use UTXOs over creation of them.


The article admitted earlier SW allows for 1.7 MB blocks normally (although it's really more like 2 MB), so I'm not sure why it's now going to this nonsensical claim that it's limited to 1 MB...


The miners also do not pay the costs! Those costs are borne by the users, who do not get fees at all.


Not nearly as much as the security of full nodes is *completely destroyed* by a hard fork, which forces node operators either to upgrade, or to unconditionally accept the loss of *any* security whatsoever (as well as loss of being able to use Bitcoin). However, this is still why softforks are best deployed by users before miners, which completely eliminates the risk.


Completely false. To roll back SW with a soft-fork, you effective would be *destroying* all SW outputs. To roll back SW with a hard-fork, you can make spending them behave *any way you like* (and it would make very little sense to choose to make them insecure like this).


Notice how he talks about Simplified Payment Verification in his justification for this transition. He never implemented it. More importantly, his public proposal for doing so turned out to not be possible in practice. As a result, we have been left with only Mike Hearn's half-SPV hack that is completely insecure, and cannot protect the decentralisation of the Bitcoin network. So unless someone (Satoshi?) wants to step forward with another breakthough that makes real SPV workable, the Bitcoin community needs to decide between Plan B, or stagnating.

What you get if you take the block, and remove the signatures. None of the current blocks are anywhere near 1 MB stripped. (It's likely smartbit is stripping signatures only from segwit transactions, but that's not really a useful number for them to be publishing.)

Only together *with* segwit, and segwit is a fairly unique softfork in being able to do it. Hence why segwit is increasing the limit to 4 MB (2 MB in practice due to new limits).

@_date: 2016-11-20 15:03:45
That's a large part of why hardforks are impractical today: because we don't have a way to. Softforks are safer because it merely degrades old nodes slightly rather than breaking them entirely.

Donation addresses as such are not safe. But since they're donations, it arguably matters less.

Doesn't make sense. The limit is there to *restrict miners* - why would you think it's sane to have them choose it? It's not just miners affected by the block size, but all Bitcoin users and potential Bitcoin users.


Say what? Miners don't decide hardforks at all. Not even 100% of them.


Segwit doesn't *have* to use block weight. That was *mostly* just there to grow the block size limit. It's certainly better in general, but I suspect there might be better ways to balance it.


Considering the fundamental problem of having miners set their own limits, I doubt it will gain very much support.

It does make some other softforks simpler, but it can't be used to turn any hardfork into a softfork (particularly, it can't do block size hardforks).
@_date: 2016-11-14 09:51:57
A better design would simply have a way to verify the data is in a specified block, rather than try to index and return the data it finds. Systems using it should be able to provide at least the hash they're looking for anyway (otherwise it's poorly designed).
But even better yet would be implementing sign-to-contract-hash verifications, so people can make their systems entirely undetectable and using much less block space. This is admittedly more complicated, however - enough that I'd wait for libsecp256k1 to add support for the primitives first.

@_date: 2016-12-22 12:32:42


Yes, much better to just send it all in a transaction. Note that you *could* import the keys manually (with HD wallet disabled), but to make this work you'd want to do it before the sync gets too far in.


Not as long as you get the key imported before your node scans a block sending to it (which is the case for new keys, or early on in the sync).


It scans just the UTXO set (not the whole blockchain) for funds controlled by the key, and creates a transaction sending them to a new address in your wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-05 02:05:47

Any centralised database can do data registration just fine. You could even use a p2p flood network to register data in a decentralised manner, no need for a blockchain.

The block size limit exists specifically to limit miners. It makes no sense at all to have miners decide it! But more importantly, miners *cannot* decide a hardfork. Every user must consent to and upgrade, or any HF attempt would just de facto turn into an altcoin. Right now, most users oppose a HF, so that's not likely to happen any time soon.

That was Classic. BU has a bunch of ugly and no doubt broken\* hacks to "remove" the limit altogether.

Every node has their own memory pool, which they alone are responsible for maintaining. But more importantly: because it is subjective to the node, it is not possible to accessed/use it from consensus-code without breaking the system's determinism.

**Transaction times:** Bitcoin already far outperforms every other system in this area. Credit cards take *months* to finalise, and even wire transfers take days. Bitcoin typically takes merely 1-2 hours. When it comes to notification of payment, both credit cards and Bitcoin as well are pretty much instant. The only thing Bitcoin fails compared to is cash, which is instantly final. Lightning will make Bitcoin also instantly final, closing that gap.
**Decentralisation:** Non-developers would need to hire (or convince) developers to exert any positive influence in direction, but developers don't control the direction either - the community can always veto any change. There isn't a strong system for coordinating agreement on direction, yet, but with softforks, miners can act as the judge. Despite this, there are major de facto problems with decentralisation right now, with no clear solution. Wishing for it won't make it happen either.
**Fees:** Decentralised systems are inherently more expensive than centralised ones. That's just how things work. The only reason Bitcoin has any chance in this area is because the established systems overcharge *a lot*. Note that miners have to pay out most of their income to electricity costs, so it's not a simple transfer of wealth there.

The Bitcoin protocol itself has no notion of addresses, and if you receive with the same address twice, you must also sign any spend twice. Two signatures rather than one can (and has in the past) reduce the security of the key, and any random p2p node monitoring the network could hypothetically use them to calculate the private key, and double-spend you before it confirms. This is currently believed to be fairly difficult to do with current wallets, but it is far from certain that it couldn't change overnight.

Even on high-end PCs, the time to do a full sync is continually growing with every block. We'd need the average block size to be 300k to avoid this (assuming technology continues to improve at the current rate).

You've been lied to. You need that complexity even with a hardfork unless you're going to throw away the old blockchain and completely break existing wallets (including burning hodl'd funds).

Importing keys isn't something you should normally do, with one exception: using an external key generator (eg, vanitygen); this works fine with pruned nodes. Importing addresses only makes sense if you're using an external wallet, and this should also work fine with a pruned node.
If you're paid with WIF privkey "bitcoin codes", you don't want to import those at all, but sweep them. Core doesn't support this yet, but [I have a pull request open to add it]( (it will also be included in the Knots 0.13.2 release).

That's based on UK *broadband* speeds - in other words, a small region of the world, *after completely excluding the lower end of the connection-speed spectrum*. Note also that the UK is among the *highest density* areas of the world, so it is to be expected that their connectivity is much above the global average since the last-mile costs are lower.
Of course, it's also a *comparison* of speeds over time, rather than looking at the actual numbers, but the mentioned details are still pretty relevant.

The seed is the initial private key material being used by a multi-step signing process which includes as part of the midstate the "private keys" you're thinking of. Some wallets may cache this, and perhaps even show it to users (although this would be *very* inadvisable), but in the end, it is the seed which is the true private key being used as the input to the full signature algorithm.

It's already a huge risk to use BU for mining at all. Segwit won't significantly change this. It may change the economics, however, since as you say, they would miss out on segwit tx fees.
They'd also need to find a way to get their blocks relayed. IIRC, segwit nodes will neither accept nor request blocks from non-segwit nodes...
@_date: 2016-11-15 03:42:55
**I strongly discourage doing this.** If segwit is indeed controversial, *no miners* should even begin signalling for it until those concerns are resolved.

@_date: 2016-11-20 21:51:32
Yes, but this would be uglier. Basically you'd throw an impossible-to-spend script in front of it. And the only difference would be that it would become a hardfork for no real reason/benefit.

@_date: 2016-11-15 06:55:33
Simply modifying the block size limit as-is would make the CPU requirements grow *exponentially* due to a bug that is being fixed for segwit transactions. Furthermore, modifying the limit directly would be a hardfork, which strictly requires consensus from every Bitcoin user, whereas segwit is a softfork that can be safely deployed simply with widespread agreement.

Too bad blockchain bloat *still is* very much a real problem even today. And not one that seems to be showing much, if any, signs of going away.
When the 1 MB limit was introduced, it was actually way too high. If miners made 1 MB blocks back then, the entire network would have fallen apart. We're lucky we can handle it today, and that's only with severe mining centralisation!
@_date: 2016-11-14 08:53:19

There is no voting. However, miners are essential to enforce the new rules for outdated nodes, so the current proposal requires 95% of them to indicate they will do so before activating. Miners are ethnically obliged in a sense to deploy or not deploy segwit based on the community's acceptance thereof. We have no strong mechanisms for indicating community acceptance, however, so miners are left to judge it for themselves.
@_date: 2016-12-22 20:20:05
When you restore from backup, the wallet needs to rescan the blockchain from the backup time forward. So if you only have 550 blocks\*, your backup can only be up to 550 blocks old when you restore it, to avoid a resync. If you keep 10000 blocks instead, it can restore up to 10000 blocks old (or a little over 2 months).
\* `prune` is specified in data size, so 550 may only be 137 blocks (550 MB / 4 MB) after segwit activates.
@_date: 2016-12-27 04:20:37
Counterparty doesn't merely anchor, it actually bloats Bitcoin's blockchain. But it's also assets, so in a sort-of grey area and arguably an acceptable use case.
Factom's anchors are technically spam, but at least in theory represent a net reduction in spam, so IMO tolerable. There are much better ways to do merge-mining (essentially what anchors are), though.
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:18:13

@_date: 2016-11-24 00:33:23


It doesn't, though. There is no "non-witness limit" right now, and won't be after segwit. The new block format is designed such that old nodes *don't see the full block* and therefore enforce the limit on only a subset of the block (which is currently ~600k), while new full nodes don't enforce the 1 MB size limit at all.
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:42:00
It'll look the same, but you won't see it before it's confirmed on the blockchain.

Running a full node makes you an actual Bitcoin user, benefiting from the ability to receive payments and know they are irreversible without trusting anyone else. As far as how it benefits the network, it is because by using it to receive payments, you are de facto helping enforce the network rules by not trusting payments which do not confirm in valid blocks (yes, you need to actually receive payments for running a full node to be meaningful).

It isn't. No matter the financial relationship of the cloud mining with the cloud "miner", it is defrauding Bitcoin itself. The block reward is meant to be paid in exchange for helping decentralise the network, yet cloud mining takes it to do exactly the opposite.
@_date: 2016-11-22 22:39:37
Part of it, yes. Note that the block size is still adjustable for miners within the limits.
@_date: 2016-11-09 08:06:49
Nope. The indexes required to access arbitrary wallets are rather large, and bitcoind doesn't support them.
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:43:15
@_date: 2016-11-20 06:11:50
Segwit allows blocks as large as 4 MB, so long as they meet newly introduced limits which in part ensure the larger block size can't do the worst-case harm. In practice, these new limits keep blocks around ~2 MB (~1.7 MB in some pessimistic estimates). It doesn't make it possible to fit any more transactions in 1 MB (transactions are more or less the same size), just allows the block to get larger.

Unlike Mac/Windows, there is no way to reasonably build backward-compatible software for Linux. So if you build it on a newer Linux system (ie, with C++11 support), it likely won't run on the older ones.

I originally discovered this about 3 years ago (after the Montreal Scaling Bitcoin, IIRC). It wasn't a concern then, and I'm pretty sure it still isn't today either: to receive coins with your light wallet, they need to be to your address, and having a destination address (even one) in the transaction puts it over 64 bytes.
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:45:40
2 MB is 2 MB, whether done with a HF or segwit. 2 MB holds the same number of transactions either way.

Or just build it yourself and verify it matches...
@_date: 2016-12-05 01:05:36
It's not. It's designed to ensure nobody *accidentally* gets left behind, but it's also designed to be easily resisted,  such that it cannot realistically be deployed without having community consensus first.

@_date: 2016-12-09 05:30:11
Except your analogy is wrong. Segwit doesn't make things any more efficient (from a space perspective) at all, just allows blocks to be larger. More efficient packing is schnorr signatures (not being deployed with segwit).
To make your analogy correct, you'd need *both* groups to be supporting making the cars bigger, but one group (hardforkers) insist on redesigning the car wheels to be incompatible with old tracks at the same time (for no gain), while the other (segwit) just wants to upgrade the train's engine at the same time (it'll need upgraded tracks to go faster, but the train will still run fine on old tracks when it needs to).
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:12:09
For Bitcoin to work as a decentralised system, at least 85% of bitcoin recipients must be using full nodes they personally control. Therefore, it would actually be better if people who cannot afford to run a full node, also cannot afford to use the currency. But in reality, that isn't practical, because they can always use off-chain systems anyway (they don't even lose anything, since you need a full node to benefit from Bitcoin).
Running a full node in a datacentre is no substitute. Someone else controls that.

"Shrink pods" may be a valid analogy for Lightning and sidechains, but not for segwit. Segwit literally just allows blocks to be larger. Nothing else.
A better analogy would be blocksize-HFers demanding the bus be made longer (and turning away people who refuse to get on), but segwit being the bus getting a second level (and people who don't upgrade refusing to go up to it).
@_date: 2016-12-05 00:42:40
That could significantly delay segwit and real scaling, since it is very unlikely that the community will accept a HF in the near future.
@_date: 2016-12-04 04:19:27
1. That looks like [BIP 103]( and it isn't a joke at all. It is the most reasonable proposal so far, arguably more reasonable than segwit's increase.
2. There was also [BIP 105](
3. And now there's segwit's one-time bump to 2-3 MB blocks.
4. Some of us also agreed to work on another hardfork proposal including a 2 MB "no wallet changes necessary" block size bump, which we've been making progress on over the past year, including even after conclusion of the original agreement (there is currently a testnet for an incomplete version running).
Edit: Please note [this comment's context]( I am demonstrating that we have considered seriously and even made proposals for hardforks. I am not saying the hardfork some of us are currently working on is in any way a substitute for segwit (it's not, and will require segwit already being activated); nor am I saying it will even be deployed on the network (that's up to the community, which seems likely to reject all HF proposals for the near future).

No, it isn't correct. Segwit allows blocks to be larger (up to 4 MB), and doesn't reduce the size transactions (or anything else) take at all. So that means the blockchain can grow up to 1 GB every 2 days instead of 250 MB.

First of all, Segwit's purpose isn't to increase the block size. That's just an unnecessary side-effect added as a compromise.
But secondly, you can't just change a few lines of code to make the block size bigger. That just produces an altcoin.


@_date: 2016-12-24 04:55:39

You can't really be secure on an insecure OS.
Your choices are:
* Run a full node which provides you Bitcoin's trustless security, but only to the extent that your PC isn't compromised (which it is, if you run Windows).
* Use a hardware wallet with a light client, which means you're trusting random people to tell you about Bitcoin and bitcoins, but you have a secure system keeping your wallet itself safe. This is somewhat of a contradiction in security, but might make sense when using a backdoored OS.
* A combination: Run a full node on your desktop and try to keep it as secure as possible, while using a light client for your wallet pointed to that full node, with a hardware wallet. This is probably as good as you can get with your OS choices.

**That was a softfork.**
The *only* hardfork in Bitcoin's history was in May 2013, to increase the block size to 1 MB (effective), which was assumed to be entirely uncontroversial because 1) something *had* to be done - the current rules were provably broken, 2) until a few hours prior, literally *everyone* believed 1 MB to be the limit already, 3) no research had yet been performed into the risks of larger block sizes, so there was nobody calling for smaller ones yet, and 4) old versions going back to 0.1 could trivially be fixed to work with the hardfork by dropping a single plaintext file in the Bitcoin config directory.
Even with this certainty, the fix was still deployed first as a softfork reducing the block size limit below what it had previously been, and the hardfork removing this limit was set to take effect two months later.
There has never been any other hardfork in Bitcoin, and the current scenario is nothing remotely like the crisis situation in 2013. Most Bitcoin users don't even know a block size increase is being even considered (perhaps not even that there is a limit!), and a significant portion of the economy even *opposes* such a change (the majority, if it were to be done with a hardfork and/or depending on just how high the limit is lifted).
(Note: Some would argue that even this one incident wasn't a hardfork because the prior behaviour was non-deterministic, and there were some nodes that managed to successfully accept the forking block, but this is a matter of unimportant debate.)

@_date: 2016-11-05 04:07:52
Then you haven't read the code. Segwit allows blocks up to **4 MB** real size. The 2 MB effective size is *lower* than the real limit, because of *new* limits that get hit *before* the block size limit.
@_date: 2016-11-13 18:19:25

Apples to oranges. The blockchain *does* grow - 144 MB every day (~360 MB when segwit activates). That's actually *faster* than improvement in technology and bandwidth. So realistically, we need to find a way to *reduce* the average block size if we want Bitcoin to continue to be accessible.
You're plotting the block size as if it's the resource itself, but it's not. It's the delta/*increase* of the resource (the blockchain).
@_date: 2016-12-10 03:19:49
You need a full node to actually *use* Bitcoin itself. That *includes* using Lightning and similar L2 Bitcoin technologies.

Interesting. So raising the block size limit is merely an "excuse" to not raise the limit? That frankly seems self-contradicting... Or is it not really the block size limit you want changed in the first place?


What if we deployed a BIP 103 like block size limit on top of segwit?


Any potential hardfork (or even softfork) could add additional rules to counteract this. For example, by weighing non-witness data as 2 instead of 4.

There is no "the mempool". Each node has its own mempool, which it can manage as it likes. It can discard transactions it considers probable to be spam. It can store everything forever. How to manage it is entirely up to you.
Once it's in the blockchain, however, everyone *must* process it. Even if it's spam. If you can't process it, you can't use Bitcoin, and have to go back to trusting someone else again, like with PayPal.

At the time segwit was proposed, bigblockers were demanding a block size limit increase to 2 MB. So segwit was designed to give them exactly that, while addressing actual issues affecting real scalibility at the same time.
So it is meant to be a compromise between bigblockers (gave them 2 MB blocks they wanted) and everyone else (malleability fixes for real scaling), all neatly packaged as an easily deployable softfork.
Of course, having effectively won the 2 MB battle, rather than taking it and being happy, some of the bigblockers have since moved on to demand absurdities ("unlimited" block size, "emergent consensus" nonsense, etc) instead.

You collect them from your memorypool as before, but instead of counting bytes, you count the Weight Units and stop before they exceed 4 million. Some bytes in transactions count as 4 WU (particularly those which affect the UTXO database), while others count as only 1 WU (signatures). So if 100% of the block is comprised of UTXO modifications, you hit the 1M WU limit at a 1 MB block. But since real-world transactions use about 40% of their space for signatures, you end up with closer to 2 MB before you hit the 4M WU limit. (More complicated transactions use even more signature space, so including those can get you up to around 3 MB. If you had a block that was 99% signature, you'd get close to 4 MB.)

No, I think this is inherently unsafe. After all, if you just have the card, you have no more information than the people who made it. Therefore, the only way to do this safely is to simply have a private key you sweep into a Lightning channel (thus introducing your own wallet's secure data).

Softforks and hardforks don't result in two flavours, only one. What happened with Ethereum is that they tried to force a hardfork on the community, and the community rejected it. When that happens, the "hardfork" becomes instead yet another altcoin, but with initial balances as things were at a past point. Hence the original Ethereum continued to function (and got renamed ETC for some dumb reason), while a new "ETH" altcoin was started essentially premined to all the ETC holders at the time of the intended hardfork.

If A sends to B, and B sends to C, and C wants to pay A, Lightning just cancels out the entire chain (in a provable manner) and it never needs to touch the blockchain.
When settlements are made, they're done as a "batch", not individual transactions.
And finally, settlements are mostly only needed when you want to pay someone not using Lightning yet, or when someone tries to double spend you (which will be never because they couldn't get away with it).

5 Mbps would take several *years* to IBD with 300 MB blocks. And that's assuming the user didn't want to do *anything else* with their internet connection, which is obviously absurd.

Yes, I'll try to rephrase this:
Bitcoin Core has a few big components: full node, off-chain memory pool, wallet, and GUI.
Most other wallet software have a few components also, typically: light node, and wallet.
Hardforks break full nodes and light nodes. (They *can* also break wallets, but I don't think anyone is proposing that.) However, segwit does require changes to the pure-wallet part to take advantage of the new features and capacity. The proposed HF we are working on for after segwit, would enable pre-segwit wallet code to take advantage of the higher capacity as well. But even then, the light-node part of that wallet software will need to be updated. (Don't try to make sense out of *why* this would be desirable - it doesn't really make sense, partly because the wallet changes for segwit are so trivial.)

Original transactions include the scriptSig as part of the txid, so it affects the UTXO set. Because of this, old clients must see the complete transaction, and will enforce that the sum of them cannot exceed 1 MB, so their data must all be counted as 4 WU anyway.
Since segwit removes signatures from the txid, we can lie to old clients that it isn't there, and they won't enforce the 1 MB limit on it - this is what allows us to count it as only 1 WU and produce larger blocks without breaking backwards compatibility.

"Full node" has never implied or in any sense required incoming connections. If people think it does, this is a misunderstanding that should be cleared up.
When it comes to serving the blockchain, a bunch of VPSs run by people in various different countries are more than sufficient - only maybe 0.01% of nodes need to do this. 
But when it comes to enforcing the rules on the blockchain candidates, it's important that a supermajority of the economy does it, or else we have a situation where invalid blocks may be accepted by the network, and the minority of full nodes are economically forced into accepting them.
Perhaps new terms would help clarify this, but I am not sure what would suffice in this respect. Historically, the term "archive node" has been used to distinguish the former from "mere" full nodes, but that may not help if people are confusing what full nodes are. Perhaps a contrast between archive nodes and "verifying nodes" or "secure nodes" or something?
@_date: 2016-12-17 04:51:27




No. Spam is an arms race; filters will improve, then spam will improve to hide better; filters will improve more, and so on. These kind of rapid updates are not only difficult to do in a consensus system, but would give the spammers a huge advantage because they would have ample advance notice of new filtering techniques, making it pretty much ineffective.
(Miners can individually deploy spam filters immediately as policies, but this doesn't help in terms of using it in the consensus protocol.)
 
@_date: 2016-12-03 08:13:17


Soft forks aren't optional any more than any other protocol rule. To be a full node, you must validate all the rules, including any activated soft forks.


Ah, so kindof like [PeerCast]( where each node relays data to the others, but without storing it themselves?
@_date: 2016-11-20 07:09:31
I *think* you would need to make modifications to any version older than 0.7.3, specifically increasing the BDB lock limits affected in the hardfork (note this can be done without recompiling - a config file in the bitcoin datadir is enough). Some have reported success anyway, but it is unclear if they were patching for this change. Also, since the issue-causing block was eventually rejected by the network, it is no longer part of the current blockchain, and therefore doesn't need to be processed to sync up anymore. The previous behaviour was non-deterministic so it's possible the right conditions could enable it to sync even a problematic block.
Note that therealbitcoin.org folk who forked an older 0.5.x version *did in fact* patch this hardfork in. I cannot imagine they would have done so if they didn't personally encounter problems without it.
But regardless, I am almost certain that it is possible to intentionally create a valid block that would be accepted by the network yet prevent a v0.7.2 node from syncing up. That is all that is necessary for it to be a hardfork.

The damage doesn't come from full blocks, but rather the spam being mined at all. So the 2 MB block simply allows for 2x the damage (in this example, *11x* the damage). And if the spammer's budget is really only $83, they will be able to continue the same 0.1 MB damage in the 2 MB block for the same price - or more likely cheaper, because they will no longer need to outbid legitimate transactions! So in practice, they will likely get 0.2 MB of spam for the price they used to pay for 0.1 MB.

This thread did not talk about scaling. Get off your one-track mindset...
But yes, centralised systems are a viable solution to scaling for things which do not need the blockchain's trustless features. Ideally, the blockchain should only be used when the recipient doesn't trust the sender, yet needs to confirm the transaction is irreversible. (Although admittedly, there's a problem with people storing bitcoins *under the control of a centralised system*. But that's another topic.)

I'm not clear enough on the details of Coinbase's issue in practice. But if they hypothetically held ethers for someone before their "hardfork", they still owe them those same ethers (now known as ETC). If they sue for them, Coinbase would need to comply - Coinbase couldn't just get away with offering them newly forked "ethers" (although they could *probably* pay up in USD equivalent of ETC due to USD's legal tender status).

I originally discovered this about 3 years ago (after the Montreal Scaling Bitcoin, IIRC).

Sorry, you're right, but only on a technicality. `CheckBlock` can indeed return true, but `CheckBlock` returning true isn't what determines if a block is valid. Rather, the block needs to also pass `ContextualCheckBlock`, which does the real check:
    if (GetBlockWeight(block) &gt; MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT) {
        return state.DoS(100, false, REJECT_INVALID, "bad-blk-weight", false, strprintf("%s : weight limit failed", __func__));
    }


This is false. Again, that check is not comparing the size of the block.
The block size is `::GetSerializeSize(block, SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION)`, not `::GetSerializeSize(block, SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION | SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_NO_WITNESS)`

With a softfork, the existing system is simply amended with a new rule, so that old nodes continue to work with only slightly degraded security.
With a hardfork, the existing system is thrown out and a new system created, so old nodes are left *entirely insecure* and non-functional. (Although there are ways to avoid the insecurity aspect, but that is still a subject of further research.)

I am not against a hardfork, but I recognise the reality that we do not have consensus for one, and that hardforks *cannot* be forced on people. I am currently working on a safe hardfork that might be deployed in a few years when the controversy dies down and the community can agree.
We absolutely *should not* have a block size increase in the near future. We may *need* one in a year or two, if scaling solutions are delayed too long, but that's to be determined. Lightning should reduce block sizes by a magnitude or two. However, considering that a hardfork in the next few years is unlikely to be possible, we *should* take advantage of the opportunity to increase *the limit* with segwit's softfork.
The current timeline is miners deploying segwit, which includes a block size limit increase to 4 MB. Miners should not increase the actual block size until the network is reasonable safe with &gt;1 MB blocks.

No, it doesn't make it opt-out/default-acceptance. Rather, it makes it so the default is "you must choose one or the other to proceed". While you will not follow an old-protocol short chain by default, you also will not process/accept the new chain's transactions either. A decision one way or the other must be made, and with SHFs, it is trivial to choose sticking to the original rules.

For Bitcoin's system to work at all, a super-majority (eg, &gt;~85%) of economic activity must be received by people running their own full nodes under their own physical control. We don't have a good way to measure this right now, but I think everyone would agree that the current situation is abysmally failing in this regard.
Additionally, the IBD costs continually increase faster than technological improvement handling them. Calculations show that in order to keep IBD costs the same, *after* taking into account tech improvements, the average block size should be no greater than 300k.
Current legitimate on-chain demand is indeed far in excess of 300k (I estimate about 650k-750k average per block), so clearly we cannot simply cap the block size to 300k today. But similarly, increasing the block size when we don't need to is somewhat foolish and risks Bitcoin's long-term survival. It is an acceptable risk, which is why most people are willing to accept it as a compromise, but it would objectively be better not to do it. Hopefully miners will avoid increasing the de-facto (ie, soft-limit) block size even after segwit activates.
(Note that once Lightning goes live and starts to acquire usage, we may see a substantial drop in block-space demand, perhaps bringing Bitcoin below the 300k marker at least temporarily. But that is still yet to be demonstrated in practice.)
@_date: 2016-12-02 11:53:17
Correct. Non-full nodes, including old, formerly-full nodes, have no increase in resource requirements. Light clients actually may get a decrease.
@_date: 2016-12-10 03:41:59
1. We don't need bigger blocks for another year or two, and maybe not even then if Lightning is ready first.
2. Hardforks require everyone to agree. Many people today refuse to consent no matter what.
3. There are not really any "unknowns" with segwit at this time. It's been live on testnet for a while.
4. There is nothing simple about hardforks, and certainly not ones that increase the block size limit.

No. It is to avoid this situation that we intentionally do not support auto-updates. Users are expected to make a conscious decision to upgrade or not, as a check on the developer team. Within the development process, we also have a policy to not merge protocol changes unless it seems to have community support.


No, it is the users. If the developers were to try to push a did not agree with, they would refuse to upgrade. Even if the entire dev team conspired to keep the change secret, there are a number of users who hold off on upgrading until they have personally looked over the changes in the new version and would presumably cry foul if something important was missing from the release notes. Additionally, every user can check for themselves (or by hiring an unrelated/non-Bitcoin developer to audit the code changes for them), and many simply hold back to their current version until they see a positive reason to want to upgrade.
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:38:10
That's up to the community to decide. I don't think there's consensus for any change right now, but perhaps when we start hitting real pressures, maybe the community may consider compromising with a hardfork. But it seems more likely the first thing that will happen is microtransactions getting priced out and such usage dying off. Unless we hit Lighting production-ready first (which is a real probability) - that could make 1 MB blocks last us a *long* time before we hit any real pressure.

2. It's Javascript, which is an extremely poor record for security and crypto, and is super-flexible to the extent that it can be hijacked in subtle ways (think browser extensions that quietly redefine how basic mathematics works).
3. It encourages either address reuse (which has [no shortage of problems]( as pointed out), or managing multiple keypairs by hand (which is liable to accidental loss, since key management is excessively complicated and humans screw up eventually).

I'm not aware of any wallet that has *removed* this functionality, but it has never been a positively supported feature, and may be removed in the future.

There isn't a change of mind, nor a contradiction here. We *do* still need a block size decrease, mostly for IBD costs at this point (block latency has been a big issue in the past as well, but presumably compact/xthin blocks has solved it). However, we're talking here about proposals to increase the block size limit. Of those, BIP 103 was the most reasonable. Note that there is also a distinction between actual and average block sizes (which should go down), and the block size limit (which deals with the extreme on the high end and needs to go up at some point).

You're simply a liar, not to mention this thread has nothing to do with scaling.
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:02:32
Basically a simple exclusion of signature data from transaction IDs, which closes most unwanted-malleability issues and makes checking signatures more efficient (linear scaling in CPU time). Additionally, it affords the opportunity to trivially make a number of changes at the same time that would otherwise be difficult:
1. Input values are now covered under signatures, greatly reducing the amount of data required by hardware wallets and other detached signers.
2. Scripts now have versions, so they can be more easily upgraded in the future.
3. Lifting the 1 MB block size limit to 4 MB, while adding a new block weight limit to avoid the most harmful effects of a block size increase (which effectively caps out the effective block size at around 2 MB).
The downside is mainly entirely due to the block size limit increase. Right now, the network is suffering severe centralisation problems due to the blocks being 1 MB, and it is likely this could get worse if blocks grow. Increasing the limit is only safe if we trust miners to limit themselves to 1 MB until this situation changes. Once the actual blocks being mined are larger than 1 MB, the resource requirements to use Bitcoin grow with it.
@_date: 2016-11-20 04:24:35
**Technically why:** The way Bitcoin works as a decentralised system is that every user enforces all the rules themselves. So as a user, you personally verify everything on the blockchain follows the rules, and reject it if it does not. To change the rules, therefore, you need everyone enforcing them to agree on it.
**Philosophically why:** A change in the rules is a change in the terms you can use your money. In other words, if you are forced into it, someone is effectively stealing from you by replacing your money with new money under different terms. You would just be making miners into the new central bank. And a centralised system works better without a blockchain, so you might as well literally just switch to PayPal.

How do you suggest we prevent idiots from burning their money?
@_date: 2016-12-18 08:34:15


Not necessarily. Federated sidechains use trusted functionar(ies) to interpret the full rules of one or both of the blockchain(s). In this sense, they can be either less secure (if the functionaries are dishonest or compromised), or more secure (since the full rules are enforced, not merely SPV proofs). There is also a hypothetical possibility of zk-SNARK sidechains which provide full validation of the rules without centralised functionaries (but still rely on honest miners to a more limited extent).

1. Reasonable block sizes currently range from ~550k to 1 MB. We're already pushing the high extreme here, and big blockers aren't happy.
2. It is no longer possible to keep fees low. Spammers will bid them up to some (tbd) level no matter what, and spam filtering is no longer practical.
3. Broad miner consensus is *very* insufficient for a hardfork. A hardfork *technically requires* consensus from the entire community, not merely the tiny minority who are miners.
4. Large portions of the community have given an absolute "no" to any block size hardfork in the near future. So long as this remains true, *it is impossible*.
5. Finally, segwit is *already a compromise* and *includes* a block size limit increase to 2-4 MB.
@_date: 2016-12-10 04:23:20


No, it doesn't.
@_date: 2016-12-18 02:06:23




No, because now the user is blindly trusting the developers of that consensus code.


Block 1 does not reward a premine to anyone. The UTXO set begins empty.


No. If we make a bogus softfork, you can plainly see it (hire a software engineer to audit if you want) and simply refuse to upgrade.
@_date: 2016-12-12 09:05:57
51% cannot do hardforks. Without 100%, it will just turn into an altcoin. If you want an altcoin, seriously, just go ahead and do it - you don't even need 51%.
P.S. Not anywhere near 51% want a hardfork right now.

I didn't say it is impossible, only that I would be surprised. Do you know anyone who has actually *used* one of those cash-for-gold shops?

Governments can ban anything within their borders. If so, you wouldn't be able to legally transact using bitcoins without some penalty if you get caught. Perhaps there are dark markets where you wouldn't be caught, but this would severely limit Bitcoin adoption within that country.

Far too few. Bitcoin has fallen from a high of ~205k full nodes, to only ~54k today. And that's over the course of a month - it's likely many are not running 24/7, and certainly few are involved in the economy 24/7.


You would need to get a handful of big miners (all likely in China) to cooperate.

Slide 4: Addresses do not have balances nor hold bitcoins. They can be longer, and are often full URIs. "3" addresses do not define nor indicate any specific format or key count.
Slide 5: "Key pair" refers to *both* the pubkey and privkey together, and no longer makes a whole lot of sense in light of HD wallets (which have a single private key/seed for all pubkeys). The signature proves *control* (not ownership), rather than the pubkey.
Slide 6: Needs a new definition of hash/hashing; this one is useless. Broadcasted transactions are not in any block or the blockchain *until* they are mined. Typo "confirmation". Probably should elaborate on the necessity of 8+ blocks for confirmation.
Slide 7: Nodes in general don't necessarily participate in the broadcasting, beyond receiving the broadcast of block headers (not individual transactions, or even full blocks). Full nodes also don't need any of those things, except that they must have downloaded and verified all the blocks at some point in time (but may have pruned/discarded them since). Typo: "light nodes". Light nodes don't perform full validation, and may not have ever downloaded the full blockchain. SPV nodes are light nodes which also understand so-called "fraud proofs" generated by full nodes to warn them of invalid blocks; these do not currently exist.
Slide 8: The block reward *includes* the fees from the block. The term you want here for the amount minus fees, is "block subsidy". Mining cannot be collaborated on; what mining pools actually do, is establish a formal agreement to share the reward when participating miners find a block.
Slide 10: "Protocol" in "Bitcoin protocol" is not capitalised. "Powers" is the wrong term here I think; bitcoins are the subject of the blockchain, but they don't really power it. Fees are not *necessarily* tied to the transaction size, just *typically* (when segwit activates, they probably won't be anymore).
Slide 11: "This is  The letter 'mu' is often ..." missing something? I don't understand the quick transition from mBTC units to protocols and algorithms...
Slide 12: Bitcoin transactions are not strictly irreversible, only grow harder to reverse the more blocks are mined on top of them. Notably, unconfirmed transactions are not difficult to reverse at all. Transactions should only be considered likely-irreversible after 8 or more blocks.
Slide 13: Bitcoin is today not censorship-resistant due to mining centralisation. The blockchain does not preserve data, and while transactions can hypothetically commit to data, there is yet no sane standard for doing so today. In no case are these useful for proof-of-ownership and only to a very limited extent for proof-of-"originality".
Slide 15: Claims too much. Bitcoin just doesn't allow *non-interactive* seizure. Your government can still force you to hand over funds, and/or punish you for violating sanctions. Bitcoin shouldn't be promoted as a means to violate the law, as if the law cannot be enforced through non-automated means. Centralised systems' primary costs are regulatory, whereas decentralised systems have an inherently higher technical cost in redundant verification. It is still to be determined which cost is overall higher, and there is no reason to assume Bitcoin will remain the cheapest option.
Slide 16: The blockchain is designed to provide privacy and as such doesn't expose abuse.
Slide 17: Have the "roots in the Cypherpunk beliefs" claims, and details of those beliefs been verified? (I don't know if it is true or not.)
Slide 18: Bandwidth requirements shouldn't be overlooked. With 1 MB blocks, each location with Bitcoin access needs at a minimum a constant ~16kbps (4.5 GB/mo) - or with segwit, ~48kbps (13.4 GB/mo). To start a new node, however, several magnitudes more is required to download the full blockchain history. It is not possible to use Bitcoin though SMS, only to remotely ask a trusted third party (using other trusted third-parties as middle-men) to do things on your behalf.
Slide 19: The network has been "down for maintenance" at least a few times, due to technical problems.
Slide 23: Nobody knows how much Satoshi did or didn't mine.
Slide 26: It should probably be noted that 51% attacks can be performed with much less than over 50% of the network, just with diminishing rates of success.
Slide 29: In addition to conspiracy, it is also possible that mining pools and miners could be *compromised* by the same attacker. Since mining all uses unencrypted connections, BGP hijacking can even take over a substantial part (probably a majority) of the network without even compromising anyone's computers.
Slide 32: Developers' decisions have no influences on the network. It is the users who choose to run the modified code who have that influence. Users also have influence since they enforce the protocol rules, rejecting blocks miners might make that do not follow those rules.
Slide 34: Contains FUD against theymos. His forums, while perhaps overly controlled by a single person, are not censored, and he a strong advocate against censorship. For this reason, BitcoinTalk became too noisy with trolling, and thus lost usefulness and is not recommended. However, r/Bitcoin has had more reasonable moderation and is still a decent place to discuss Bitcoin (although never has been used as a technical forum).
Slide 40: Nobody knows how many bitcoins Satoshi mined.

@_date: 2016-12-22 19:38:58
Probably. The only other thing I would note is that *if* you need to restore from a backup, you'd need to redownload/resync the entire blockchain.
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:22:59
Because why rush? Unlike previous softforks, segwit requires changes to mining pools and in some cases even the miners themselves. Best to take it slow and do testing to ensure blocks aren't lost in the process.
Eloipool and libblkmaker could use further review and testing:  
@_date: 2016-12-22 10:53:31
One possible way might be to put bounties on code changes you're interested in; perhaps code reviews, since that tends to be the bottleneck. This way, rather than trying to figure out how to divide up donations, you can just send it to the specific developers involved in meeting the bounty, and get some influence over development as well.

Whether or not segwit is controversial, there is clearly no consensus for a hardfork, so it is impossible. Unlike hardforks, softforks only require widespread acceptance, not 100% consensus.

In the end, the block size limit isn't actually about limiting the byte size of blocks. You *can* change how you store numbers like this, and it wouldn't even be a hardfork, but it won't get past the block size limit.

* Cheap/low fees: Haha, no. Just heavily subsidised right now.

@_date: 2016-12-10 04:49:31
We aren't hardforking to 2 MB. In some hypothetical alternate universe, the answer would depend in the segwit proposal. If you just put the current segwit on top, you end up with the exact same thing since segwit technically *removes* the block size limit.
@_date: 2016-11-13 00:43:35
The block with the witness stripped out is not the full block. Old nodes don't get the complete block anymore - that's [part of] why they're no longer full nodes.
If you strip out the witness data from current non-segwit blocks, you won't get nearly 1 MB of data either - more like 600-650k.

A very big problem. But the Bitcoin community refuses to address it.
@_date: 2016-12-03 07:09:42
Bitcoin isn't really ready for more adoption yet. But more notably, while there is no immediate rush for segwit, we only have another year or two at the current rate of adoption before blocks will *really* be full to 1 MB, and by that time we will need either Lightning or capacity for larger blocks, both of which are provided through segwit. So while segwit can perhaps wait some months, pursuing more premature adoption is liable to directly contradict the ability to put segwit off.
@_date: 2016-11-02 07:20:41

We don't. A few of us went to a meeting the miners invited us to, where they proposed an agreement to run only Bitcoin Core. I insisted that at the very least it must not be specific about the software, and say only Core*-compatible*.


There was no trick. Everything was perfectly clear upfront.

@_date: 2016-12-09 02:14:40
Any hardfork, no matter what style, must have consensus. With that in mind, the impression that bifurcation won't happen is a reasonable one. Your argument that it would is based on the premise that users are opposing it, in which case it wouldn't be deployed in the first place.

Sounds like he tried to claim an old state, which means he'd end up with more bitcoins than he had a right to. So the other side of all the channels would then automatically block it by claiming everything for themselves (as is intended to occur when someone breaches).

1. Join [ on freenode]( and subscribe to the [bitcoin-dev mailing list]( Just watch at first, as you study the code.
2. Learn how to use git. Install and learn Linux if you haven't already.
3. Pick something from [the easy-to-implement issue list]( and figure out how to do it. Submit your changes as a pull request on GitHub.
4. As you learn more, gradually move up to more complicated changes (don't try to change the consensus protocol until you're more experienced). Focus on review as much as you can - it can be a good source of learning how to do things, and is typically the main bottleneck toward getting things moving forward.

Extension blocks are not a softfork.
@_date: 2016-12-09 04:48:55
That's called Lightning.
@_date: 2016-12-17 04:29:36
There is no "1MB + segwit" on the table. The segwit proposal lifts the block size limit to 4 MB. In practice, new limits restrain blocks to 2-3 MB. Both a segwit 2 MB block and a HF 2 MB block can contain exactly the same number of transactions.
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:35:33
Well, that's because 0.12.0 is also outdated and network-inconsistent. Latest version is v0.13.1, but anything v0.12.1 or newer should be fine (for now; note v0.13.1 or later will be necessary when segwit activates).
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:25:04
Because spammers were willing to pay almost that much, and miners have decided they only care about profits.
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:04:25
It just gets worse and worse with block sizes over ~300k...
@_date: 2016-11-30 07:48:30
Sure, it would have a premine equal to the final state of the previous Bitcoin. Whether that is implemented by processing all the old blocks, or a snapshot, doesn't really matter all that much.
@_date: 2016-11-29 12:00:35
The block size limit prevents damage from exceeding a specific threshold.
@_date: 2016-11-03 03:31:35
There is no "extended block"; that's a myth the trolls use to FUD.
Your linked transaction is in "decoded" form, which is not an accurate representation of the transaction itself, and doesn't need to change for segwit. You need to select "hex" to get the real raw transaction. In this case, it is:


If we directly convert this to a segwit transaction, it becomes:


All the same data from your decode is still there, but in a different order that makes it easier to skip witness data when calculating the transaction id.
(Note that you can't *actually* spend non-segwit coins (UTXOs) like this, however, so this transaction is invalid because the inputs it references were not paid to a segwit wallet.)
@_date: 2016-12-17 04:15:04
The block size limit needs to be deterministic, calculated the same for all nodes, including those that aren't even online at the time the block is found. So to base it on network latency, you would need a way that reliably measures the current latency the same for all nodes both now and retrospectively in the future. I don't think this is possible.
Additionally, thanks to compact/xthin block relay, network latency is no longer a critical bottleneck for block sizes. Now the critical factor is just IBD time.
The nice thing about IBD time is that we can predict it somewhat. The downside is that any block size larger than about 300k means it outgrows technological improvements forever... :/
@_date: 2016-12-05 02:24:27
He's really describing a hardfork there, though.
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:16:01
@_date: 2016-12-22 08:32:54
It's not really possible to know. I'd guess somewhere around 25000.
r/Bitcoin has 196635 subscribers, so it's probably reasonable to guess there are *at least* 200000 people owning bitcoins.
That gives a full-node to bitcoin owner percentage of &lt;13%, which is quite dangerously low.
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:26:00
I think the current bottlenecks are:
1. IBD time/cost for new nodes: This reduces to bandwidth and CPU. Currently, the average block size must be &lt;= ~300k to maintain the current IBD costs *assuming reasonable improvements in technology continue*. Nobody has a good solution for this yet.
2. User transfer limits: Many residential ISPs have 5 GB per month limits. 1 MB blocks puts Bitcoin at around 4.2 GB/mo for "leeching" nodes. Presumably users don't want to max out their limit just for Bitcoin either.
3. Block relay latency: For mining to be decentralised, blocks must relay across the p2p network sufficiently fast in comparison to centralised relay networks (ie, FIBRE). Compact and xthin blocks should significantly help minimise block size impact on this metric, but it's not clear if we're there yet.
Most of the "backlog" is spam, and *should not* be mined even if we could do so without *any* critical drawbacks. There is about ~750k/block legitimate transaction usage right now, and we probably have another year or so before we approach fully using 1 MB. (When Lightning goes production, that's likely to *drop* magnitudes - maybe ~10k/block.)
@_date: 2016-11-12 00:54:12
Also false. People discuss alternatives to Core just fine here. So long as they're still Bitcoin (and not some altcoin masquerading as Bitcoin).

Don't use webwallets [in general]; nor even light wallets for receiving funds from others [unless you configure it to use exclusively a full node you operate yourself].
[Bitcoin Knots]( can load multiple wallets at the same time.
@_date: 2016-12-03 07:58:22
The original plan is to have transaction fees replace the subsidy. It's unclear if that can actually work. After all, why mine block N with 250 BTC worth of fees, when you could re-mine block N-minus-one with 500 BTC fees and bribe almost all the other miners to prefer yours with 100 BTC of that? One way to fix this is to ensure there are enough transactions to constantly fill every block to some limit (you couldn't fit more than the ~250 BTC worth of fees), but constantly full blocks (without spam) *probably* has its own problems (but it might not with Lightning providing instant confirmations?).
@_date: 2016-12-06 08:49:02
You're only safe from QC if you 1) don't reuse addresses, even before QC; and 2) stop sending bitcoins the moment the QC begins working.
When QC becomes a reality, Bitcoin will need a hardfork (or softfork?) before it is safe to continue using.
@_date: 2019-10-23 23:40:52
It's like setting your house on fire.
@_date: 2016-11-20 00:19:18
It makes no sense to stop counting witness data, so that would be an 8 MB hardfork, not 2 MB.
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:33:04
Segwit already includes a 1-3 MB block size limit increase. *It is a compromise.*
@_date: 2016-11-16 08:51:09
Obviously the first transactions in a block will be as high as the miner can find...
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:24:20
The block size increase *could* be removed from segwit.
@_date: 2016-12-21 10:16:13


I wouldn't say that transition is happening at all. Lightning will make "digital cash" with Bitcoin practical at even a large scale.
In any case, my technical opinions are based on technical limitations and practicalities with how Bitcoin's technology works, not based on goals of what I'd like it to do. If it were technically possible to put everything on-chain with unlimited block sizes, I'd be fine with it - but that's just not the reality. So gold and how it works simply has nothing to do with it at all, really.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:34:22
Dunno, seems simpler to just install a program on your existing PC, but whatever.
@_date: 2016-11-26 07:03:47
Segwit is completely vendor-neutral, as is Lightning. Furthermore, both are decentralised systems, that don't have central services or servers at all.
@_date: 2016-11-20 07:47:55


It's usually pretty obvious when there *isn't* support, at least.


Softforks like segwit can do that, but it's impossible for hardforks. Miners need to be very careful about disenfranchising minorities even with softforks, however, as in some circumstances it would essentially be attacking the network and defrauding them of value.
@_date: 2016-11-15 15:20:17
Upgrading is simple. Just install the new version. Migrating it to another PC, however, is not so simple. You need to backup the wallet from the old system (should do this regularly regardless!), and then restore the backup on the new system, and then be careful to not use the old system for Bitcoin anymore. There's no simple way to restore backups, however. Basically you need to drop the wallet.dat file into the Bitcoin data directory (which you'll have to create on a new system).

The only reliable way I know of to positively incentivise audits is to pay people specifically to audit it (ie, pay is regardless of whether they find an exploit or not).
You could also offer a bounty for reported exploits, or deploy a test with real funds and a statement that anyone exploiting the test is free to keep any funds they take, but these aren't typically very motivating honest auditors, and dishonest ones will likely wait for the "real deal" to exploit instead.
Perhaps there's a happy compromise between these two, though: pay a reasonable rate to do the audit (so they're not left without any reward if the code is good), and offer a bonus for each exploit found.

If it's for donations, you probably don't care so much about security or privacy, so most people just do it anyway.
The ideal solution would be to give the webserver a list of addresses, and have it show a different one to each potential donator (ie, a button you press to donate and it gives you the next address).
@_date: 2016-12-08 00:26:36
If you receive with an address more than once, you need multiple signatures, *ever if* you only send with that key once. So it isn't secure to receive multiple times, even if you only send once later.
Furthermore, this isn't only a QC risk. To date, there have been *two* instances where the private key could be calculated from multiple signatures. There's no reason to assume more cannot be found.
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:17:30


1. Many people consider 1 MB blocks too large, and don't like the idea of trusting miners to not make larger ones in the near future.
2. Now that 2 MB blocks have been conceded in Segwit's compromise, the "2 MB blocks" camp has decided 2 MB isn't actually enough and they want to remove the limit altogether.

Compact fraud proofs aren't possible (although I'd be happy to be proven wrong, I can't see any possible way to fix the problems).
If Roger can find new developers to fund, however, that's probably a better outcome than helping fund my work, and I can totally get on board with that so long as the new devs take things seriously and don't half-heartedly just push for bad ideas without learning how things work first. But either way, it seems like they should be getting the support of existing developers even if they don't fund any of us - after all, we're the ones who will need (and are willing to) spend a lot of time helping the new developers learn the system.

The linked code is nothing more than an example of how a softfork can be temporary.
Bitcoin may or may not reduce block sizes. That may or may not involve a softfork. The community needs to collectively make these decisions.
Personally, based on the evidence that current block sizes are very harmful and a threat to Bitcoin's success, I think we should reduce block sizes, including using a softfork. But I don't get to single-handedly decide.

Depends on your wallet software and the recipient's wallet software.

No, just as we didn't see the 32-bit/64-bit edge case without much searching. You only find out the differences when someone triggers them. There's no reliable way to produce multiple implementations so bug-free that they can be expected to meet the necessary requirements of exactly identical behaviour needed for a consensus protocol. This is why we consider the *code* to be the authoritative protocol, rather than the documentation.


It's not up to developers, it's up to the economy.


I don't think there was ever a well-defined fall back plan, but it wouldn't have been significantly different from the 0.8.0 fiasco. Presumably the only realistic approach would have been the same: to immediately deploy the BIP66 softfork with a simple miner majority (ie, skip the supermajority check).

[After 6 years, we're around 350k/block average volume.]( Blocks are generally only 1 MB today for one or more of these reasons:
* The miner is spamming (or at least failing to perform prudent spam filtering - which is the *job* of miners).
* Due to variance, the block has taken above-average (&gt;10 minutes) time to find, and is therefore also above-average size.
* Bitcoin adoption is not spread evenly across timezones, and busier times may have higher than average volume.
Note that blocks are *not* expected to include every legitimate transaction available, and low-priority/fee transactions *should* wait until low-traffic parts of the day (or week, as we get closer to using capacity) to get mined.


In an emergency, a hardfork can be pulled off in a matter of weeks. The one hardfork in Bitcoin's history, in 0.8.1, went live 2 months after being released, and that wasn't even an emergency.


The block size limit was added specifically to address the risk of miner spam, at a time when such spam was strictly theoretical. As a matter of fact, this spam has become one of the bigger unsolved problems with Bitcoin today, as miners neglect to maintain their nodes and are pressured by insane mobs to make blocks bigger by filling them with spam. So, now is the most important time we've ever needed the limit. If miners were to step forward and say they would behave responsibly, I wouldn't mind lifting the limit prematurely so much.


Eventually, if Bitcoin manages to get entire countries adopting it. I doubt this will be until long after everyone has plenty of bandwidth/resources to handle larger blocks (ie, probably at least a decade or two).


1 MB blocks are actually insanely large compared to resources available to Bitcoin today. It's not a centralised system where you just have to download 1 MB every 10 minutes. Since it's a decentralised p2p network, most nodes need to be able to *upload* blocks to multiple peers in a timely manner (30 seconds is pushing it). People also need to *verify* the blocks are valid - which adds up to quite a bit of CPU time even with ECDSA's significant savings.

* You omit a large number of core devs from either of your lists. Why?
* Blockstream does not have a position on the block size matter, much less compel employees to support its positions.
* Sidechains do not improve or solve scalability directly at all, nor has Blockstream ever claimed they do.
* I am intentionally *not* an employee of Blockstream, and remain independent.

It's possible to discriminate against relaying certain blocks, sure. However, this is not a *good* idea, since it make global consensus take (slightly, if you're alone) longer, and your criteria is very subjective. There is no such thing as "the mempool" - each node has their own custom set of transactions in *their* mempool.

@_date: 2015-08-29 19:32:18
There's nothing malicious or dishonest about customising your own relay policy - in fact, it's encouraged that you do. If your transactions don't pay enough fee to get propagated, you'll just need to increase the fee.

Pretty much. It completely screws over anyone who doesn't and/or forgets it - if that number is significant, then they could effectively force a reversal.


No, P2SH was a soft-fork. Since it's just adding new rules, a simple majority of miners are sufficient to enforce it, and it doesn't break non-miners. This is significantly different from a hard-fork, which is the *removal* of rules, and would be rejected by every current node (which is why *everyone* needs to agree to update).

No. Full blocks are not problems - only when the average is full. The variance of blocks simply delays low priority transactions slightly.


Gavin doesn't seem to be taking the centralisation problems with his current IBLT concept seriously... so I can't take IBLT seriously.


What he's describing seems to have rather high latency, as you need a number of round trips before you can even *begin* to verify the block (which is not optimised at all by doing this). I agree this hacks away at the main bottleneck right now (bandwidth), but at a high cost that I expect may very well counter-act it with a new bottleneck.

No, this is policy, *not* part of the protocol.


Also policy.


Sorry, wrong. This is part of the protocol.
The difference between policy and protocol lies in whether it is enforced against blocks. If it is enforced on blocks, then it is part of the protocol. Policy rules, on the other hand, are only enforced on unconfirmed transactions when relaying and mining - blocks are free to "break" your policies. Because of this policy may (and should) vary from node to node.
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:51:33
This seems to incentivize people to vote higher/lower than what they really want, in order to counter others' votes - which will recursively influence itself, so miners will only vote for 9.999 or 0.000 until the size adjusts to what they want.
Note that unless you declare an invalid vote as an invalid block entirely, miners are likely to vote extra-high to counteract their invalid-vote blocks, and announce both valid-vote and invalid-vote to the network.
Nit: ASCII wastes space, which is already tight. If we're going to hardfork, use binary and/or increase coinbase size to compensate ;)

No, all the miners affected had *expressly said* they supported the rule change. Then it turned out they were not enforcing *any* rules at all. Even if the rule hadn't changed, someone could have just made an invalid blockchain and they would have extended it.

It's true that softforks degrade old full nodes to lesser security than intended (although still far better than BitcoinJ's "SPV" security, I might note). However, it's still better than nothing - getting a 6-block confirmation basically still needs a 51% attack to pull off.
Hardforks, on the other hand, leave old full nodes with *literally nothing*. They lose all security, and gradually stop working entirely for legitimate use. Faking them into thinking your double-spend has 6-blocks confirmation may not be cheap (although it gets cheaper as the real network progresses), but you're guaranteed to pull it off successfully.

Personally, I think the sizes should be specified as a multiple of 100 (or at least 10) kB.
But if someone reduced it beyond a point where a valid block could be made, miners would be unable to continue that chain, and would need to go back and make a chain without that problem longer.
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:15:51
Uh, those "absurdly huge data files" *are* the [cumulative] block size. But it's only 54 GB, or about $5 of storage. This is much cheaper than any of your other costs as a Bitcoin node.


No, that's *exactly* what we've been discussing...

Public keys are a low-level primitive in the Bitcoin protocol, are (despite their name) actually *private information* and shouldn't ever be exposed to end users. Addresses are a high-level abstraction people send bitcoins to in order to transfer between wallets. They are implemented with scripts that quite often end up using public keys for authentication, but are entirely distinct from those keys. An address should only be given to the person you intend to pay you, who should only ever use it for a single payment.

If this were to happen, they would swap positions, yes.
Edit: I misread this first "economic majority" as "economic consensus", which would be necessary for the position-swap. Economic majority can probably *force* economic consensus, but isn't sufficient alone.


But that is not the case. XT forks the chain with a mere miner majority, which is entirely unrelated to the economy (miners do not receive bitcoins, only send them). Furthermore, even if it forked on economic majority, a mere majority is not a consensus.
Also, even if the main chain did not achieve the miner majority to trigger the fork, the consensus rule for it still exists as a potential avenue for an attacker (he just needs to simulate the 75% on his fake chain).
@_date: 2015-08-10 22:05:58


No, I don't notice that. The first and second ones are directly caused by block sizes.




* A "self-configured" node or server must be controlled by someone else, so this is effectively no better than not having a node at all. Decentralisation comes from *you* administrating it.
* It works against you in terms of electricity cost, since this is an additional PC that cannot share your usual resources, and you can't take advantage of its 95% idle time when it isn't processing a new block.
* Larger blocks make it impractical to run a node on cheap embedded CPUs. While this isn't a problem today, it's certainly a problem if we start increasing the block size prematurely.

You can't verify block N+1 until you verify and process block N. So to verify block 370463, you inevitably need to verify all the blocks down to height 1 too. This can be "fixed" with a rather complicated softfork (UTXO set commitments), but even then you would need to not only trust that those previous blocks are valid, but also trust that the first block you are checking has not committed to a compromised UTXO set.
There is a potential to teach Bitcoin Core to use SPV mode, and upgrade to full node mode in the background. This seems like the most practical avenue if someone wants to make Core usable faster.

If you do 100 transactions on Lightning, when it comes time that you want to settle them, you can afford to pay a single larger tx fee.

Economic consensus is reached when everyone people might want to pay with bitcoins, is okay with the change. So miners don't matter (nobody pays them), developers matter only slightly/insignificantly (at least those who are paid in bitcoins), and merchants are essentially the deciding factor.

Remember all those problem when BIP66 activated? Those weren't actually related to BIP66, but rather the block size being large enough that over 50% of the miners had given up verifying blocks before mining on them.
Transactions competing for block space has been an expected behaviour of Bitcoin since Satoshi designed it; it isn't destabilization at all.

That single tx needs 52 signatures. Someone could be running a relay node that receives it, calculates the private key from those signatures, then instead of relaying broadcasts 52 individual double-spends, which now relay faster than yours (because they're smaller), and even a single one is sufficient to block your own original transaction from being accepted.

You can consume them all in a single transaction, but only by using a separate input for each of them - that is, spending each one separately. Now in the unlikely event of ECDSA being compromised, I can just run a relay node that looks for these, uses your N signatures to derive your private key, and re-spends each input in a double-spend to myself. Because my double spends are now smaller, they also propagate the network faster, and just a single one is sufficient to prevent nodes/miners from accepting your original, eventually leading to my double-spends all confirming, and you losing 100% of the funds.
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:51:53


It's still not a problem until we have nearly 1 MB/block worth of high priority transactions. Low priority can reasonably take up to a week (but we'd better increase the block size before we get anywhere close to that).


The "compact form" proposed by IBLT is inherently tied to Gavin's specific miner policy preferences, and falls apart if miners don't use those policies. Thus, miners who set their own policy (as should be the norm) rather than use a centrally dictated one are penalised for doing so in higher stale rates resulting from their blocks propagating slower than negligent miners'.


So you get the filtered block, and then you have to request each transaction you don't have...

Therefore we should keep the block size at 1 MB at long as necessary. Is that your point?

When you're dealing with bitcoin services that are poorly implemented like this (there is no reason they should wait for confirmation to payout\*), you just need to make sure you pay a sufficient fee.
\* it makes sense for them to wait for confirmation to accept the bet in the first place, but it does *not* make sense to delay payout if they will accept the bet regardless of the late confirmation; they just need to use your bet as an input so if you double-spend it, you lose the payout too.

No, blocks were taking too long to process, so &gt;50% of the miners at this time have (by human action) simply disabled processing them...

To begin using Bitcoin, you need to download and process the entire blockchain since 2009. This is already a serious problem with 50 GB per year.

Where is "my place"? If this is your home, you have the right to do anything legal. "Botnet" is a term generally meant to imply a compromised machine.

Well, perhaps it might be possible to have blocks commit to known stales - but generally stale blocks don't even get propagated, and the centralisation effects of larger blocks makes that problem worse.

1. On principle. The community wanted it, and the miners had no business maliciously blocking it.

@_date: 2015-08-11 05:07:57
Yes, Bitcoin XT is (as of 0.11.0A) an altcoin because it deviates from the Bitcoin protocol rules, and will not function as the same network from the moment its deviation becomes a practical difference. From that point onward, "XTcoins" will be incompatible with normal bitcoins, and there will be 21 million of them distinctly held from the 21 million BTC.
Other software forks of Bitcoin Core are possible without making an altcoin, simply by preserving compatibility with the Bitcoin protocol.
Hard forks to the protocol itself necessarily need near-unanimous agreement (consensus) from the Bitcoin economy (people exchanging bitcoins for goods and/or services), independent of what software implements it.
@_date: 2015-08-02 04:28:54
Miners have no influence on hardforks - *especially* PoW changes. The *two* miners left will just get ignored and left behind.

@_date: 2015-08-08 03:42:22
Sure, you could - but why not just use a traditional database for this? Blockchains have loss-of-privacy implications that may not be legal especially for internal bank stuff...
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:08:18


Yes. You can't have a limit of 8 MB unless you can actually handle every block being 8 MB. Besides, even if you wanted to do something like change the rule to "*16 MB limit across the last 6 blocks*", resources aren't bursty like that - a bunch of empty blocks in a row does not in any way make a larger block "easier" later.


We won't. If actual transaction volume gets anywhere near 1 MB (probably ~2 years away in a worst case scenario), there will (probably) be consensus for a hardfork to increase the size. If centralisation is still a serious problem by then, *maybe* first people will be expected to move microtransactions to off-chain networks to buy time.


Not significantly, considering how slow progress is on making Bitcoin practical for common people to use (good user interfaces, security, etc). It's more likely that we'll have scaling solutions like Lightning long before any mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:07:39
Essentially, all reasonable ways to solve malleability issues come down to "exclude the signatures from the txid" (aka Segwit) in one sense or another. The implementation details to get that aren't so important.

The 3 interferes somewhat with binary division, which is the only kind humans can naturally handle mentally. Try slicing your next pizza into a dozen slices - or a half dozen if that'd make them too small.

Yeah, it was a pretty precarious situation. When we're still discovering these subtle critical issues, I wonder what makes Gavin think it's safe to play with entirely different implementations on a production network... it seems to work against the point he's trying to make in the email you linked.

How is this relevant? What other information would you deem "pitfalls"? How about these facts:
* Addresses are only supposed to be used for a single payment.
* Addresses are technically obsolete but nobody has bothered to make the newer "payment requests" usable to end users yet.
* Saving your private seed is not a sufficient backup since you can still lose your metadata (which is usually more valuable than people think).
* The low-level Bitcoin protocol has no notion of balances, and the entire end-user view is an abstraction.
* It is impossible to know or prove who sent a Bitcoin transaction today, unless the sender compromises their entire wallet.

Actually, if these pools all decided to destroy someone's bitcoins or ban them from using bitcoins, they very well could do so today. If too little % of people run full nodes, they can successfully inflate the currency, steal bitcoins, etc as well.

Cheap internet is not everywhere. The best available where my house and acreage is located, is 5 Mbps down and 0.5 Mbps up, unless I pay 120 BTC to convince the cable company to go 1 mile further.
I do think people outside big cities ought to be able to use Bitcoin (which means running a full node). Decentralization can perhaps still be achieved if a minority are excluded from using Bitcoin, but 8 MB blocks would cut off a rather *large* minority, and shouldn't be considered unless it is essential for Bitcoin's health.
Absolute number of nodes does not make Bitcoin decentralised, percentage of economic majority with full nodes under their direct physical control does. That number is already dangerously small today, and making blocks too big will make it impossible to recover.

No, I think the ideal form of government has a single well-educated ruler at the head, and all other officials merely act as his representatives. He is not elected or otherwise accountable to his subjects, and therefore can dedicate his full effort to managing the country, rather than wasting time, money, and politics trying to further his career, get re-elected, or explaining to everyone else why he makes every decision he makes. This also saves everyone else time since they can focus on their own jobs, and not try to make a part-time effort to learn politics, candidates' positions, and what policies they want to support in voting.
There's potential for abuse in this, of course, but I would hope by now it's clear that other forms of government are at least as bad in the end.
I also think monarchies should be reasonably small, and (perhaps "minarchist" in a sense) not overcomplicate the government/law.

A "live" wallet.dat is not sufficient alone to make a complete recovery. When you use Bitcoin Core's "Backup Wallet", it actually "closes out" the file before it makes a copy, but normally the file is an opened BDB database. If you need to recover from such an instance, you will want to get the "database"/ subdirectory as well, which may contain critical database state information to recover from.
There is a chance the sync may recover sufficiently, but you will want to double-check that the last address you generated is in fact in your address book still. If it isn't, try creating (up to 100) new addresses and see if it shows up. If not, be sure you notify whoever you gave those addresses to, that you no longer can receive with them.

No, increasing the block size limit would in fact give China even more control, and depending on how big blocks got could cut off non-Chinese miners entirely.

Sign my transaction with a non-DER valid-BER signature, mine a block with it, and give it to the merchant running "TheRealBitcoin" who accepts 1-block confirmation. That merchant's "TheRealBitcoin" will see my transaction confirmed (because it fails to enforce BIP66), but it will never be so on the real bitcoin network, and I am free to double-spend it at my convenience. If I can trick a few stupid SPV miners into building on top of it, I can even get it up to 2 or 3 block confirmation before the real network overtakes it with a longer chain. This is a risk accepted as a tradeoff by SPV clients, but not acceptable for full node clients which are expected to be secure on their own.

This is not sufficient. If most people just relay to one other node, you lose exponential propagation.


Mining pools are not particularly relevant in this aspect of the discussion.


Only in big cities, not most of the US.


Yes, about 17% more bandwidth per year on average. Which is why sipa was suggesting it for block size limit growth (which I support).


Even 1 MB makes me a leecher right now. Admittedly, I have sub-par internet available (0.5 Mbps upload max unless I fork over ~120 BTC for cable), but 4 MB would put it out of reach for a much larger group of people. Give us at least a year to catch up to 1 MB, and then grow the limit based on actual improvement (ie, sipa's proposal).
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:11:54


Uh, no. Does Comcast really give you unmetered 17 Mbps upload? And while it may not require a high-end computer, I have serious doubts a crappy computer could reasonably handle it.


There's only enough for ~350 k/block right now. The problem is miners spamming.

It's not CPU intensive as long as you keep it synced, only when it has to catch up (especially from 2009).

Supposedly Electrum's server list self-filters broken nodes from the list. This probably won't catch XT until it actually forks though, so Electrum users may simply want to restart in January.
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:45:37
Before XT forks off the blockchain (2016 Jan), you'll probably need to get a full node to ensure you only accept transactions that confirm on your blockchain of choice.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:28:44
Storage has *never* been a problem or concern. It's the bandwidth required to download it and the CPU time required to process it. This is days, and continues to get longer *despite* significant advancements in technology (which may or may not continue).

What is the cost? If you want 1.9x block size or less, it's free to always vote for 1.9x.


No, what counts is the *target*, not the actual hash value. If modified to make invalid votes also invalidate the block, this BIP will introduce the option for the miner to adjust the target for the first time ever (outside of the rare retargetting blocks), so the question needs to be asked. If the lower target is counted as better work, a miner voting for a larger block size automatically gets a free win in any stale block race - which seems dangerous in a number of ways.


This is only possible right at the last block of a difficulty retarget window.

People running with default policies is currently one of Bitcoin's more serious problems. As the memory pool grows, the software will use more memory to store it, and if your PC runs out, it may slow to a crawl and/or shutdown the node.

This means your backups include sufficient information that they can recover any bitcoins sent to the wallet at any future point in time (short of explicit user action to counter this). Normally, wallet backups need to be updated every ~90 transactions or the backups gradually become invalid and lose access to bitcoins (including ones received prior to the backup!). Note that it does not mean you can "backup once ever", since you would lose your metadata (comments, etc) if you don't refresh your backups.

Unfortunately, there is. Bitcoin's history has shown that spammers are often willing to not only pay fees, but also outbid legit transactions on fees. The fact is that *most* miners today *are* mining mostly spam.
Also, you're ignoring the risk of a miner's motive being to harm Bitcoin, even at personal expense. For example, consider the big banks. With a reasonable block size limit, the damage they can do without 30% of the hashrate is severely limited.

sipa's proposal has nothing to do with Blockstream, and Blockstream does not require employees to take specific positions. I do not know if there is a consensus among Blockstream-related developers that sipa's proposal is a good idea. I personally think it is reasonable. It was based on some research showing ~17% average bandwidth growth yearly, that has since been amended to suggest ~30% is a better estimate, so perhaps further compromise might be possible (although not necessarily a good idea). Other factors for block size have also surfaced recently that haven't been studied at all, and should probably be considered before going further.

Actually, until 2012ish, it was impossible to run a Bitcoin wallet without a full node, so that would have been the peak healthy-network. There's a reasonable balance between adoption and decentralisation, I think, but going beyond 1 MB today would probably be irrecoverable. (Although the hard limit could be lifted provided miners can be trusted to keep a low soft limit - which appears to be less and less the case due to idiots harassing them.)

I would suggest defining Bitcoin by the consensus protocol/rules. In terms of its changing, adding additional rules/restrictions require a miner [super-]majority, and loosing/removing current rules/restrictions require an economic consensus.
[Certain rules]( (such as the 21MBTC limit) are considered to be against a "social contract" and would be best to treat as an attack without consensus of all Bitcoin holders as well (although an economic consensus can effectively ignore the social contract if they chose to).

It seems many people take an all-or-nothing view to the matter of hardfork support. I would like to put forward the following categories/levels to help clarify discussions:
* Ideological support: You like the general idea, but are not sure it's a good idea in practice at the moment.
* Specific support: You think the specific idea is not only a good idea in general, but also well-defined and appropriate for use at some point.
* General support: You would like the community to adopt this change in the near future.
* Activist support: You actively campaign for the community to adopt this change.
* Coercive support: You would like the economic majority to effectively force the change on the rest of the community by adopting it ahead of consensus.
* Divisive support: You will adopt this change regardless of the economy, and pressure anyone else who wishes to do business with you personally to follow suit.
All of these, of course, have similar negations as well. I imagine there are "levels" I have missed here - anyone like to add to it?

Holding doesn't make you part of the economic consensus. Spending does, but accepting it as payment is the critical factor: if the people you want to pay bitcoins to only accept the new 8 MB blockchain, you need bitcoins that are valid on that blockchain, and you are compelled then to support the 8 MB blockchain yourself. Inevitably, this means the economic majority are the people accepting payments who can collectively compel 100% of Bitcoin users to adopt the new blockchain.

The flaw is that there is no voting at all. Either there is economic consensus (near unanimity) for a change, or there isn't. Furthermore, economic support cannot be measured by software, only by humans - so there is no way to write node software to automatically switch when an idea reaches consensus; it must be measured by humans, and deployed at the exact same moment (eg, via a switch at a agreed-on median time).

@_date: 2015-08-26 00:24:21


No, because (under the current BIP draft) the block remains valid even if the vote is invalid/ignored. So it would work out to 1.9x on average (treating 9/10 blocks as 1.000). To get the behaviour you describe, the entire block needs to be rejected based on the adjusted difficulty.
Hmm, another thing this doesn't appear to address is how work is calculated. Is a blockchain with more work (because of bigger block-votes) considered better than one without?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:38:12

Yes, I agree if there are two implementations and the only bug is one which triggers a crash of one, then you have an edge case where it's an improved situation. However, as soon as there are three implementations, you effectively lose that edge case, and even with two implementations, we can't eliminate the risk of non-crashing consensus bugs.


The problem is that since the implementation *must be perfectly* the protocol, implementing the same protocol twice is almost completely impractical. Virtually every time someone competent has reimplemented Bitcoin, they discovered a new rule that nobody had previously known existed (including being missing in other previous alt implementations). Even aside from reimplementation, we continue to discover new such rules all the time (eg, the BDB lock rules, OpenSSL 32-bit/64-bit BER rules, etc). Maybe some day consensus system science will develop to the point where many implementations become practical, but with so few people seriously working on it today even with all the attention Bitcoin has received, I'm not sure it will be any time soon - maybe not even during my lifetime.

It is technically possible.
Is it ethical? I'm not sure. It's not good to block people from spending their money - but since you're leaving a percentage allowed, maybe that's still okay.
You'd also be cutting off the possibility of other Segwit-like improvements later. That's *probably* okay, but do you want to carve it in stone?
But more importantly of all: it is *not* unconditionally good to adopt Segwit at this time. You seem to be approaching this from the angle of "Segwit adoption = block size increase = good", but in fact block size increases are *very bad* for Bitcoin at this stage. For that reason, I and others are wilfully *avoiding* using Segwit transactions, and would also oppose such a softfork.
Can you still enforce the softfork successfully despite our opposition? Maybe. Unfortunately, most bitcoiners are under-educated on this subject and would probably support you. Since it's a softfork and not a hardfork, you could probably force us to go along with it.
So now we're back to: is it ethical? Since this softfork materially harms those of us who oppose it, I would say *no*.

If every (or most) node took 10 minutes to relay a block, the miner would get his block out to his own peers presumably fast, but then each hop would take 10 minutes to go further. In the end, you'd probably see blocks take hours to traverse the entire network. This additional hours of delay *might* be acceptable for someone waiting for confirmation, which isn't expected to be fast anyway, but it has an importantly dangerous side effect: it becomes impossible to mine anonymously/decentralised; to have any hope of finding a block, miners now need to participate in some centralised miner backbone. So effectively, if you can't upload the block in at most 30 seconds, you're not really contributing in that respect at all.
Leechers don't need to upload at all (much less over 30 seconds), but the health of the p2p network depends on most people *not* merely leeching.

Proof of stake is a buzzword without any real working (that is, not vulnerable to attack) implementation or theory.
As I see it, inflation encourages either waste or neglect, because people don't want to save money. Those of us with enough money can invest it in things (real estate, businesses, etc), but the poor will never have enough money to do this, so their "way out" seems to be to live as well-off as they can paycheck-to-paycheck. This makes them effectively economic slaves to whatever employer they depend on for that regular paycheck, since they no longer save money.
Deflation, on the other hand, encourages *everyone* to save their money. Too much deflation may put a burden on investments to produce more, but to apply this extreme to deflation in general seems a bit unreasonable.  Overall, it seems a lot better for the poor relatively speaking than inflation.

My mistake; in the comment on this thread, I had misread what I was responding to. Added an Edit to fix/clarify.


In most realistic scenarios, yes. It's conceivable miners (who don't necessarily represent any significant part of the economy) *could* continue to mine the old chain, but it's not realistic for them to do so since nobody will accept their (now-)altcoins.


Whether it might swap places and became the main Bitcoin at some future point, is unrelated to whether it is at present an altcoin, which depends on the current will of the economy.


This is not the case. As I explained above, XT is *currently* using a diverging consensus protocol, even if the de facto blockchain is not being interpreted any differently. An attacker's chain may very well trigger such diversion, even if the main chain never does.


Not sure what you mean by "partial nodes"?

Not just "currently", but *necessarily*. With the present state of consensus systems, it is *impossible* to separate the protocol from the implementation. (And even if they were separate, implementations would *need* to be perfectly equivalent.)


Actually, changes are discussed on the development mailing list in what is known as the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process. So that part is already distinct, at least.


Separation of the protocol implementation into an independent libbitcoinconsensus is already in progress, but even this moves slowly since we need to be careful not to accidentally change the protocol it in the process (as happened in 0.8.0).

This appears to be a discussion of just that!


Everyone (or close to it) in agreement.


Miners do not constitute nor represent everyone. They have no more sway/say in hardfork changes than anyone else. And 75% is unreasonably low even if everyone was included - 90% should be the minimum really.


A supermajority of the discussion has been in the open on reddit I think...


Block size is simply *not* an active issue, as much as some people keep FUDding about it. There are much more important issues that I and many others would prefer to focus on, and the talk about block sizes is a distraction from those. Bitcoin is at ~35% capacity now, and probably won't have growing pains for a few years. If Lightning is completed in that time, those growing pains get put off a decade or so before block size needs to change.

This isn't something viable to hide. If other, common people can reasonably continue mining, then obviously it isn't centralised yet.


We just need to make it so they stand to earn more by selling the hardware instead of self-mining.


There has been a single hardfork in Bitcoin's history. It reached consensus agreement within 24 hours, and went active without a problem 2 (or 3?) months later.
The problems with the block size are because the proposals are *harmful*. A decentralisation hardfork would be somewhere in between - it may need convincing the community, but there's no reason for anyone to outright reject it.

Almost all miners are using a centralised backbone to minimise stale blocks. If we assume that is *required* to mine, then yes, the stale-block argument mostly falls apart (to an extent). But then you might as well just go ahead and centralise Bitcoin mining entirely - a backbone is only acceptable as an *optional* thing.

Both of those were *soft* forks, not hardforks. Softforks require only a majority of miners, not the economic unanimity that hardforks need. The one hardfork was included in v0.8.1 to take effect 2013 May 15, removing the BDB lock limit rules (effectively increasing block size to 1 MB).

Empty blocks are not a function of SPV mining.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:52:04
FWIW, BTCChina denied doing this. F2Pool says they did. We have no hard evidence either way.
The problem is really incentives, though - according to F2Pool, without this they were getting 4% stale blocks, compared to the norm of 2% - and with this hack they reduced it below 0.5%. So ideally we should at least level the field so they can get the normal 2% stale rate without header-mining. They have offered to donate a Beijing-hosted cloud server for Matt's block relay network, so hopefully that will help.

But this doesn't enable you to actually use Bitcoin (the system, not the currency - which anyone can use with centralised services like Coinbase just as well). Right now, the only secure way to control your own bitcoins is with a full node.

Because it unnecessarily will centralise the network. Hopefully broadband will be much more widely available before we start hitting up against 25 million users.

Bitcoin's p2p flood network does it already. That's what unconfirmed transactions are.

No, because then all full nodes would need to store an infinitely growing index of killed addresses forever. There is also no mechanism for *rejecting* transactions.
This isn't a real problem, though - the payment protocol (which replaces addresses) already makes it possible to cycle compromised keys, and addresses are single-use anyway.

Such a mechanism exists, but I am not sure if it will behave in this way with an actual hardfork. In particular, old nodes will consider the new blockchain a DoS, and ban nodes that try to serve it. So the old node may never see enough new blocks to trigger the warning... I'd have to test it in a realistic environment to be sure.

@_date: 2015-07-11 00:06:29




Sorry, no. Signed messages do not prove the signer has control of the private key (which is not really a property of the address in the first place). It proves that if you send bitcoins to that address, the signer will receive them. This is not the same thing.
There is no standard way to prove you control a private key today; and the only standard way to prove you can send bitcoins today, is to actually send them.
This confusion makes me regret adding a GUI for signmessage. :(

Running a full node only contributes to the network in a few ways:
1. Providing blocks to new nodes. Pruned nodes don't do this.
2. Decentralisation. Nodes run under others' physical control (ie, servers), or nodes that are not used for receiving payments don't do this.
3. Decentralising transaction policy by relaying transactions. This is pretty much only useful if you actually configure the relay policy.
Disclaimer: Not sure I've iterated *every* possibility here, but these are at least the main functions.

I mean CLTV is implemented only as policy, and not in consensus code (where it would be dangerous to have prematurely). This makes it useful for limited testing, and your node helpful for it in the future when CLTV is actually active on the network.
For example, assuming 0.12 includes CLTV, to actually send a CLTV-using transaction, you would need to get it relayed to the miners. Any 0.11 node with the default policy spam filters will reject the transaction it doesn't understand, but a node with mempool-only CLTV will correctly recognise and relay it on.
On the other hand, there is a small risk (for miners) too: if the CLTV specification changes in an incompatible way before the final version, you will be making invalid blocks if you fail to upgrade before the fork goes completely active. But generally miners must upgrade for softforks anyway.

All blockchain size issues are applicable to block size.

Yes, but you need 4 inputs in that transaction, one for each UTXO. If you do it this way, you're saf*er*, but not entirely safe: if I have a way to go from multiple signatures to private key, I can as a relay node dissect your transaction, make double-spends for all 4 inputs individually, sign, and relay *those* instead - all automatically. Now since these 4 transactions are much smaller than your 1 transaction, mine also relay faster. Additionally, as long as *one* of my four gets to a node first, it will *reject* yours and wait for the remaining 3 of mine. In the end, you will be very likely double-spent in this scenario.

This would probably best be a variant of RBF-FSS, but with a condition that the low bit of the value indicates the value may be reduced. didn't want to do this because it basically equates to publicly flagging which output(s) are change, but it seems like a reasonable (and opt-in) compromise if people don't want to just deploy full RBF...

73 seconds after the previous block, so it's not impossible there were only ~32 actual non-spam transactions ready to be mined. Realistically, it seems wizkid057 has been having some difficulties keeping false positives as low as we'd like while trying to stay on top of the latest spam changes - so there's probably some legit txs missed. Refining the algorithm is an ongoing process.

Bitcoin's decentralisation relies on (at least nearly) everyone downloading all of the blockchain, and keeping up with it in pretty close to real-time. Bigger blocks makes that completely impractical for a lot of people who don't have access to broadband (eg, 25% of the US, for most "big blocks" proposals), and inconveniences many more who don't necessarily want to pause all their other internet traffic every 10 minutes... thereby encouraging "light nodes" which merely trust other peers.

No, real Bitcoin nodes consistently rejected the invalid forked chains. I used BIP66 as my example, but any other post-0.5 softfork would work just as well. I could just as well use an invalid P2SH (BIP16) transaction to fork off "TheRealBitcoin" nodes.

The best-practices for webwallet services in a nutshell:
* There are two\* wallets shared by all users, one hot with minimum necessary funds to process user withdrawl/send requests, and the other cold/offline, to keep the majority of funds safe from anyone who might compromise the server.
* User account balances are counted as simple numbers in a database.
* Transfers between users on the service are detected and performed off-chain, by simply adjusting the numbers in the database.
* When a user sends to an external Bitcoin address, the hot wallet performs a blockchain transaction, using the most efficient combination of UTXOs available to it.
* When a user wants to receive bitcoins, they are given a new address and any bitcoins sent to that address result in their database account balance being incremented by the appropriate amount.
\* There can be more than one cold wallet, but I'm simplifying.

I would agree, *if* this was a softforking BIP which miners decided on, *and* if slush was running a node that actually implemented the softfork. But this is a hardfork BIP, and miners have no say in it. Really, pools which participate in it at all ought to be boycotted on that basis alone. (Unless they wait for the economy to switch before using it themselves.)
Edit: To slush's credit, he's not running his node with BIP101 consensus rules. While I did just say a pool offering a softfork to miners *should do this*, the situation with a hardfork is very different, and how slush has done it (without a BIP101 node) is the *best possible* way to offer it as an option.

@_date: 2015-08-02 16:35:46


Yes. Consensus systems are far from a walk in the park.


The 2010 overflow bug maybe came close, but it was during a time when bitcoins had no value. I expect if it occurred today, we'd see a softforking fix without a chain reorg.
The 2013 database bug demonstrates the exact *opposite*: The previously-unknown BDB-limited consensus rules were upheld, and the new 0.8 without the "bug" was treated as non-compatible It was only months later when there was a planned hardfork with consensus that the BDB-based rules were removed.


Basically this can only happen if the network consensus has switched to the alternative implementation. If there is no consensus across the network, things just break down in very bad ways.
@_date: 2015-07-29 08:19:39

You're missing a big distinction. With USPS and email, people are free to discard spam at any time. With Bitcoin, once spam gets mined onto the blockchain, every new node must download the spam again - which also means other archive nodes must keep it around forever. So your analogy is only valid while spam is being relayed - it breaks down the moment a miner puts it on the blockchain.
With USPS and email, the cost to spam is linear with amount of spam. With Bitcoin, you pay once to get infinite spam forever. So infinite spam vs actual transfers... guess who is willing to pay more.

Not really. It's *possible*, but it'd be like using property/deed transfers and writing notes in the margins so you can look them up later by going to the city archives. Except while city archives generally have an index you can use to find your deed transfers easily, the blockchain has no such index. It'd be *far* cheaper, easier, etc to just use a data structure actually intended for data storage.

@_date: 2015-07-24 07:47:55
I would consider a delay for my free transactions to indicate that I need to investigate the cause. It could be a new spam attack nobody is successfully filtering (most likely today); or it could be a sudden up-tick of adoption indicating that it's finally time to start seriously thinking about lifting the block size limit. In the latter case, I wouldn't consider it a crisis situation until the delay becomes multiple days - but by reacting promptly when the delay begins, we can potentially take care of the size limit *before* any actual problems occur.
Basically, as long as free transactions can get mined in the very next block, there's no reason to even be *thinking* about messing with the block size.

Waiting more than 1 block for free transaction to be mined is *not* a visible issue. A visible issue is when a fee-paying transaction needs more than 1 week to get mined (or, alternatively, when it is dropped from mining nodes before getting mined).

60 minutes is the *minimum* expected time for transactions to confirm. The only "instant" Bitcoin supports is unconfirmed. For low priority transactions, the expected target should be confirmation "within a week". If you want a simple option for confirmation time, I suggest:
* ASAP (target next block)
* Today (target within 72 blocks/12 hours)
* Tomorrow (target within 216 blocks/36 hours)
* Economy (target within 1008 blocks/1 week)

It doesn't have to be centralisation-proof. If the ASIC producers centralise it again, we just hardfork again, until they get the picture and stop trying to centralise Bitcoin (instead making their nice profit by selling the ASICs to others fairly).
At the very least, I would implement a reasonable alternative. The handful of miners have no power when it comes to this. The hard part is getting the community on-board for the change.

Nodes don't really support the network in a meaningful way unless there is a human using them to receive payments (or mining). If they leech without uploading in a timely manner, they're actually harming (not necessarily in a malicious sense) the overall network by increasing propagation time.


That's every single full node (except for pruned nodes, at the moment).
@_date: 2015-07-23 06:21:28


Running a full node is only relevant if people want to pay you, and you are using your node to receive the payments.


Miners can only force block sizes smaller. They have no say whatsoever in lifting the hard limit.
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:37:23


It's certainly a lot more likely to work than increasing the block size.


Yes, that's kinda the whole point.


Right now, every single Bitcoin node knows everyone's entire payment history. So this seems like a strict improvement, even if true (but I don't know if it is).

@_date: 2015-07-23 20:29:52
No, it doesn't. It proves you received or will receive funds sent to the address, and nothing more. Shared wallets where you do not have access to private keys, are *expected* to allow you to sign messages with addresses you receive on, and are *expected* to pay no attention to which keys control funds when any other user goes to spend them (this is a necessary prerequisite to the hot/cold wallet separation).

Individual/DIY is ideal, but somewhere in between is acceptable too. The complete industrialisation, where people mine only for profits, is a serious problem.

No, blocks have a *permanent* effect on the network.


No, because attackers would simply hold off so that people don't shy away from making it permanent. Just because an attack isn't performed over some period of time doesn't mean it's impossible.
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:22:10
Not the awareness of them, just the decision-making based on them. For example, an attacker might produce a large number of intentionally-stale blocks to drive the block size down. Or a miner majority could censor blocks that report stales in order to drive the size up.

If it's a real paper wallet (usually something like 35 words), it's fine as long as you only receive with each address once.

@_date: 2015-07-27 21:57:17
Miners build the blockchain which determines the "official" *order* of transactions. The only thing they do is determine the order, nothing more - this is necessary only to resolve double-spends. The process of building blocks is intentionally as expensive as possible, to prevent a competing potentially-hostile miner from "rewinding" the blockchain to reorder transactions.
A node, on the other hand, enforces all the rules of the bitcoin protocol, and for ordering of them only determines what the longest, valid blockchain is.

Addresses don't own private keys nor bitcoins, wallets do. Signed messages were only meant to indicate the person receiving with the address agreed to the message. That is, when you pay that address, you have a signed contract. Anyone who can receive bitcoins should be able to produce such a signature, even if they are using a shared wallet. If you want a "proof-of-funds" signature, you can make one, but it's not what the current signed message standard does.

When there was enough real transactions needing to be confirmed to fill 1/2 MB - which isn't often.
@_date: 2015-07-25 07:17:16


Probably some day. Currently unscheduled.


No, but if Bitcoin XT tries to do it without consensus it may indeed be an altcoin (and not really a hardfork). A hardfork by definition needs consensus.


An altcoin-wants-to-be-hardfork occurred once - accidentally - in 0.8.0, and the consensus blockchain prevailed despite having much fewer miners. However, that was resolved in under 24 hours since there were no proponents insisting on the switch to the altcoin, and losses were minimal. If people are knowingly insisting on the altcoin, it is likely things will work differently (probably significantly more losses), but IMO the consensus chain will prevail in the end.
There was a single consensus-supported hardfork in 0.8.1 to increase the maximum block size to 1 MB\*, which transitioned without any problems, and without any noticeable effect on the market.
\* The previous limit was not measured in bytes, and could have theoretically produced blocks as large as 1 MB, but only if they were specially made as an attack.

There is no theoretical difference between how Electrum works and BitcoinJ works. Only the network protocol, which is irrelevant. (Electrum's network protocol sucks, but is more efficient than BitcoinJ's, even though the latter got merged into the reference software.)


Only if you're not using it to verify payments received by you. Until you complete the download, you can't upload the new block, and since everyone else has it first, there's nobody left for you to upload to - so the upload is effectively reduced to (or close to) zero.
Note you may see higher upload in practice when someone selects you for IBD (Initial Blockchain Download). This is useful to the network, but there are more than enough nodes capable of providing this service already.
@_date: 2015-07-24 08:22:11


Only by *trusting* other people about what happened before. This might be possible to make a reasonable security model (with softforks), but it is definitely a *different* one.
Also note that until recently, due to improvements in mining technology, it was possible for miners to restart the blockchain from scratch, replacing all of 2009-present, in only a few months. I'm not sure what the current timespan is, but I doubt we're at a year already. In practice, this means trusting anything older than 1 year is either (if measuring real-time) unsafe, or (if measuring work-time) ineffective since we don't have 1 year.
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:30:54

You're forgetting hardware wallets. Although, yes, I do think Bitcoin's success necessarily requires people learning to keep their computers secure. Unfortunately, I'm not sure this is going to happen any time soon.
Maybe a compromise can be made though: [Whonix]( is an operating system that runs two virtual machines: one with a Tor node, and the other that can only access the outside world over Tor. It seems like one could do a similar trick for Bitcoin: have a virtual machine that emulates a hardware wallet in a secure environment (potentially making full use of their monitor/keyboard/mouse), and then a second VM with the user's regular OS.

Until it confirms, you can always double spend your bitcoins in theory. As long as you pay who you said you were going to pay, there's nothing wrong in doing so. Note that contrary to 's reply, there is never a point where a transaction is rejected: until you *successfully* double-spend the first one (meaning your double-spend is confirmed), you cannot be sure the first one will be cancelled - so there very much *is* a "limbo forever" state unless you act to end it.
@_date: 2015-07-02 01:18:09
I think "support" is a bit strong. I would obey and uphold a just law, because the State is acting with the authority of God. But that isn't the same thing as approval/support, and I would (given the opportunity) try to have it repealed.
Note, there is also a matter of whether such a law is constitutional, and if not, it would lack the authority of the State (and therefore lack the authority of God). This also does not apply to non-State entities, unless the State delegates that authority to them.
Also note, Bitcoin does not use encryption at all.

The entire blockchain must be downloaded. Pruning just means you can delete it after you've downloaded and processed it.

The amount of storage costs like $5. Bandwidth is a problem - hopefully Lightning will help mitigate that.


This is true of the blockchain, but there is no reason to have most bitcoin transactions on the blockchain.


Not really. But it *will* make your bandwidth problem much worse.
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:25:41
Rather unlikely. 10 Mbit DSL would probably only have 1 Mbit uplink, less than half of what consistent 1 MB blocks will need. Bitnodes' CPU (4x 1.5 GHz) is probably sufficient for up to 7 MB blocks (my 800 MHz ARM barely keeps up at 1 MB blocks), though.

Both can't get confirmed as long as they're double-spends of each other. It will never fail until a double-spend confirms.

@_date: 2015-08-11 13:29:51


It's easy to test an implementation against past blocks, but so far *every* competent attempt to reimplement the consensus rules has discovered new rules that nobody previously knew had existed. Even something as innocent as changing the backing UTXO database changed consensus rules in 0.8.0 without anyone aware. How certain are you that your btcsuite node will withstand attack from a hostile actor?


Compilers are not consensus-critical. Many large complex projects have uncovered serious compiler bugs before - they just aren't as critically affected by them as a consensus system would be. Unfortunately, definition-by-implementation is the best we can reasonably expect for the near future.


No, BIPs are for cross-project standards, including anything changing the Bitcoin protocol itself.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:40:19
The only thing really on the table (as far as block size is concerned) is a reduction, not an increase.
An increase requires consensus, which many of us can personally guarantee it will not achieve in the near future since it is technically a terrible idea.
A reduction, on the other hand, is not only technically a good idea, it only needs some minimum level of community support, not absolute consensus. Indeed, there are at least two scenarios where it would not even require any protocol change at all! (Miners can soft limit their blocks; users can artificially increase their transaction weights)

The flood network doesn't work the same as the blockchain. It isn't merely a matter of writing these transactions to disk. Everyone saw *different* transactions, in *different* orders. If you could simply write them to disk, we wouldn't need miners at all.

Increasing minrelaytxfee will reduce your memory/bandwidth footprint, but has a high false-positive rate if your goal is to target the spam only. Some of the long-running spam can be filtered by merging my spamfilter branch. Some of the newer stuff can be caught using [-limitunconfdepth](

@_date: 2015-07-07 01:36:45
Users of the system don't need to, but spammers are *abusers*, not users (although they might be users in other context, and their legitimate transactions should still get mined). It is impossible to supply the infinite resources needed to support spam, and impossible for a set of fixed consensus rules to identify spam reliably in an adversarial model. Therefore, the Bitcoin system outsources this task to humans - miners - who are supposed to stay on top of the spamming techniques to keep it out.

Nodes are not required to store unconfirmed transactions at any point; this is not related to the block size at all. There is no "the mempool" to refer to - each node has their own which they have absolute dictatorial control over.

Developers (Core or otherwise) can only express an opinion and give informed advice. We actually have very little influence over the block size (or base Bitcoin consensus rules). The most we could do is refuse to cooperate and quit development if the network hardforks.
Miners also have little influence, except that they can impose *additional* restrictions over the economic majority. In this case, they can *reduce* the block size limit, back to or below 1 MB.
The relevant people to the decision-making here are the *economic majority*. That is, who do you want to accept your payment? This is most likely BitPay and Coinbase, since so many merchants use them for processing. If both of them decided Joe's altcoin was the new Bitcoin, most likely everyone spending bitcoins would be pressured to go along with it, creating consensus, unless they had a strong reason to refuse (eg, a hardfork to change total bitcoin supply).


What? Most of us don't think there is any imminent need for a blocksize increase.


The costs are more significant for other users, not miners.

Yes, the two changes are technically identical. However, these kind of changes (hardforks) require virtually everyone using Bitcoin to agree to them, and it would be *much* harder to convince everyone to change the limit on number of bitcoins.

It can provide an archive of the blockchain, yes, but that's the one function that "you only need *enough* of them" is true for - as long as there is sufficient archive nodes, having more doesn't help.
The important part (which everyone ideally has) of a full node is using it for accepting payments, and this is only secure if you have physical control over it.

You have it backward. Services where they can't set their own fee are screwing them up, not Bitcoin. Complain to the right people.


Yes, and I think miners should proactively be filtering it out (as the pool I mine with does). But that doesn't make it any less the fault of &lt;unnamed service&gt; that they won't let you set a proper fee.

You're conflating addresses, wallets, and keys here, but the simple answer is that I don't think there is any easy way to do what you're asking.

Bitcoin developers don't adopt policies. Nodes and miners do.


Shouldn't you be working on *educating* people on *what Bitcoin can actually do*, rather than making impossible demands of what you think Bitcoin should do?
Both microtransactions and scalability together are simply impossible for the blockchain with today's resources. If people want to do them, fine (I don't support censoring microtransactions), but it's only realistic to expect it to inflate the transaction fees close to their actual cost (which is relatively high).

Or just post it publicly and hope it doesn't contain any sensitive info, I guess.... :p
My guess would be that some time between February 20th and April 5th, you upgraded your OS. However, you failed to upgrade Bitcoin Core at the same time, and you are still to this date running 0.9.2.1, which OpenSSL broke compatibility for in their security-related bugfix on January 8th.
To fix this, you will need to upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.10.2 or later, open the debug console (Help menu-&gt;Debug window...Console tab) and enter:
    reconsiderblock 0000000000000000119f56ffb43faf9270e2e9b8a5ec8bde97d37c69d27e5cc3
After having done this, if you wish to downgrade back to 0.9.x, you must first wait for the sync to complete 100%, shutdown your client, check to be sure there were no new blocks found during shutting it down, and then install 0.9.5. Note that using 0.9.x is *not* recommended, and is at this time less well-tested than 0.10.2 or even 0.11.0. If you can, I recommend staying with one of those versions.
To avoid problems like this in the future, you should read the release notes of every new release of Bitcoin Core even if you do not intend to upgrade immediately. They may contain important information related to your security.

The first level of defence in Bitcoin transaction security is that nobody knows the public key until you spend it. This is why quantum computers do not pose a threat: because while they can break ECDSA, they can't break the SHA256 hash used on top of it. Furthermore, even *without* quantum computers, ECDSA weakens when there are multiple signatures available; so far there have been two ways to calculate the private key based on address reuse, and I think it's unreasonable to assume there aren't other unknown methods yet to be discovered.

No, usually brainwallet.org is full of crap, but in this example it is working just fine. The signature proves that the person receiving bitcoins at that address has agreed to the contract to provide Ethercoins in exchange for payment. So for example, you could take:
* Proof address 1FpFU2oQx7LHxc589mLUiiav4CqVnbmLRU was created by John Smith.
* Proof you are the one who sent bitcoins to this address.
* Proof the owner of this address agreed to the contract terms. &lt;-- *this* is the only part the signed message does for you.
...to court, and theoretically have it enforced. (Note, however, that you have no way to prove you sent the bitcoins in this case.)
It does not, however, prove anything in terms of how much money the recipient *currently* holds - they could very well have spent it all and you would have no way to know it (and they have no standard way to prove it).

This is pretty much entirely up to the miners and Lightning hubs. I expect there will be a number of no-fee hubs out there you could use (or run your own!).

Softforks are voted on by miners, and need some kind of (weighed) supermajority to become effective. These changes can only *restrict* the blockchain beyond what is already allowed, and are backward compatible.
Hardforks require near unanimous agreement among all Bitcoin users. In practice, the economic majority ("who do people want to pay?") can force a consensus. These changes can do pretty much anything, including potentially making Bitcoin inflationary.

A full node is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It enforces the protocol rules to provide trustless and secure currency to its owner/operator (and to an extent, others running compatible full nodes).
Without a full node, you are not using Bitcoin, and do not benefit from it. Rather, you are merely trusting random Bitcoin users to honestly report to you about what is happening with Bitcoin - similar to using PayPal, but with an unknown third-party.

Bitcoin only uses integers at a low-level. The BTC value you see is an abstraction: the actual value is being divided by 100,000,000.
Miners may claim up to 2,500,000,000 plus fees in value for their block... but they're not required to claim it all. I don't think anyone has intentionally claimed less than their maximum allowed recently, though - 358997's 24.98983201 BTC is only *one* of the two generated outputs.
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:26:29
When a miner sees someone else found a new block, it takes them a few seconds to calculate what transactions should go into their own next-block. During this time, they have three options:
* Turn off all miners until the new block is ready.
* Continue to mine on a competing stale block (harmful for network consensus, and probably wasted energy).
* Mine on the new block without transactions until the transactions are ready.
The last option doesn't provide security to any new transactions, but it *does* improve the security of all previously-mined transactions and gets the miner their reward. So it is the ideal option in this circumstance.
@_date: 2015-08-07 02:25:23

@_date: 2015-07-07 01:23:42
Uh, no. If anything, it demonstrates the block size limit is necessary. Miners should *not* be including spam transactions *no matter how little legitimate volume there is or how big blocks are allowed to be*. Those should be discarded permanently by the network and never appear on the blockchain. The fact that miners are not doing their job to filter them out, means the block size limit is needed to prevent miners from doing more damage. That's why the limit was added, and it's doing the job as well as can be expected.
@_date: 2015-07-25 09:02:07
No, old-style paper "wallets" are not as secure if you spend any of their funds. Also, you *cannot avoid* multiple spends if you used them to receive more than once.
As a rule, Bitcoin addresses should only ever be sent to once. Multiple times is unsupported and defeats one of the layers of security, in addition to also harming the privacy of every single Bitcoin user. This goes for any address beginning with '1' or '3' regardless of what kind of wallet it is in.

For a centralised mining pool, I'd say we need to keep it under 30% at least. For physical (or S.P.) control of mining hardware, even 1% seems like too much - but we're already beyond that. :(


Right now, the primary factor seems to be hardware manufacturers abusing their position by self-mining instead of selling the hardware (at a reasonable price). To combat this, I think the only option we have is to change the PoW algorithm to break their ASICs by a hardfork.

It's not optimal. Turns out we should have a lower limit. Ideally, miners would behave responsibly and soft-limit their own blocks, but "block size increase" mobs appear to be harassing them to be irresponsible. :(
I suspect the optimal limit right now would be around 500-600k. This gives enough space for the current volume to grow for a while, but hopefully lessens the centralisation effects we've been seeing as blocks approach 1 MB.
IMO, though, it's not worth the effort to softfork the limit down since it's a pain (hardfork) to increase it back to 1 MB later. Miners should just be responsible setting their own soft limits.

Into the ljrP variant, yes. I'll accept a patch to make it configurable provided it doesn't negatively impact performance, though. Long-term plan right now is to just make it unnecessary.
Note the ljrF variant does still have a user-configurable *address block list* (which defaults to none), but it doesn't have the same performance and only works for specific addresses so is less effective at reducing spam impact on your node. (I'm not sure if it can be configured outside the GUI either.)

Disappointing they are apparently acting so negligently. Increasing the soft block size is only a good idea if you're doing at least half-decent spam filtering. Otherwise, you really should be reducing it (or not mining at all). Seems like we really *do* need that 1 MB hard limit after all. :(

Bitcoin addresses don't have bitcoins. You can show an address *received* bitcoins, but the UTXO produced by that transaction is not in any way associated with the address itself. Take a typical shared wallet scenario:
* Joe receives 5 BTC with 1addrA, and this is his full balance; UTXO  is created during this receipt.
* Fred receives 4 BTC with 1addrB and UTXO  is created.
* Joe now wants to pay Bob 4 BTC. A best-practices shared wallet will use UTXO  as the input since it is a perfect match of value.
* Joe's balance is now 1 BTC, however UTXO  which was created when he received with 1addrA remains valid. However, Fred has ownership of 4 BTC of that 5 BTC. This is not visible on the blockchain in any sense.
* Joe can still sign messages with 1addrA.
To try to explain it from another angle, there are 3 theoretically possible kinds of signed messages:
1. Proof of possession: that you currently have X BTC.
2. Proof of address ownership: that you receive bitcoins sent to an address.
3. Proof of having sent bitcoins: that you were the person who sent bitcoins in a transaction.
Of these three, the only one actually implemented today is

75% is not a consensus at all, it is a supermajority. Consensus is *everyone* - or for practical purposes, nearly everyone. Furthermore, this is only 75% *of miners*, and the overlap between mining majority and economic majority (which needs consensus for a hardfork) is *very* small.


The commercial incentives are strongly in favour of the remaining 25% unless the economic majority has a consensus in favour of the change. That 25% will get more bitcoins mined, while the 75% are spinning wheels mining invalid blocks.


If it were necessary or important, there wouldn't be debate.

Fees don't compensate the people adversely harmed by the spam, and even if they did, it wouldn't justify it. So yes, spam is still spam regardless of what fee is included for it.
Actual donations (such as those in your link) are, however, not necessarily spam, even if they are of low value. These would only be spam if the same person was sending them all, which doesn't appear to be the case (but I didn't look deep into it).

There is no implied promise that an address will remain valid after you send to it. If I give you an address, and you send me two transactions using it, and I don't get the second transaction (let's say my wallet discards private keys after it uses them), that is *your* liability, not mine.

Lots of them do. Centralised off-chain transactions like Coinbase, and OpenTransactions have existed for years.


Far better to have a centralised "layer 2" than force layer 1 to centralise. You can't build a decentralised system on top of a centralised blockchain. Lightning is still completely trustless, but *only* if everyone continues to run a full blockchain node themselves.


Long-term as in *decades later* - which is likely to be long after most people have access to sufficient resources to continue running a full node.

Addresses never send bitcoins, only receive them. Refunds are a new feature in the payment protocol (which *replaces* addresses).

The base rules of what is allowed is set by universal *consensus* (100%) of Bitcoin users, and effectively changed by economic *supermajority* (that is, if the person you want to pay uses a different blockchain, you are forced to make a transaction that is valid on it). Allowing things which were previously not allowed (eg, bigger blocks) can only be done in this way, and is called a hardfork because it breaks backward compatibility - old nodes cease to work.
From there, the rules are further restricted by the *majority* of miners. Since old nodes accept a superset of the new rules, they continue to work with degraded security.
Developers have no say in making the decisions at all, but can provide well-informed advice to these groups. Furthermore, any change necessarily needs at least one developer to write the software changes for it.
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:46:04
I agree that Bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption. There are many serious usability issues, and most people simply don't *have* secure phones/computers, and couldn't secure them if they tried.
@_date: 2015-07-25 12:30:34
Correct. Bitcoins are normally secured by ECDSA+SHA256; if ECDSA is compromised, your bitcoins are still safe as long as you don't try to spend them. With address reuse, you are limited to only the security of ECDSA; now if ECDSA is compromised, all bets are off and you've lost all your bitcoins.
(If SHA256 is compromised, the whole blockchain falls apart anyway, so that's not really a scenario to worry about.)
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:19:14
They can tell you 5 BTC you received was only 0.5 BTC, so you sign a transaction paying 4.5 BTC more than intended. Or tell you a bogus transaction has confirmed, so you hand over goods for it.

Archive nodes technically do have such a list, but it is not optimised for searching, and such optimisation (an index) would take a lot of complexity, disk space, etc on its own. Furthermore, there is no need for more than a handful of people to run an archive node. Regular/pruned full nodes, including miners, while they do need to download the entire block chain once, can discard old blockchain data once they are done with it.
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:37:12

For the 2013 hardfork increasing block size to 1 MB, developer consensus at least was achieved in under 24 hours, and the actual hardfork went active 2 months later. Pretty sure in an emergency we could easily get it down to 2 weeks. In the meantime, considering that 99% of people with bitcoins don't run full nodes anyway, they could just as well be using centralised off-chain services. Or alternative, decentralised off-chain services like OpenTransactions. It's not like Lightning is the only option - we already have scalable solutions that work today.

This is only possible if people let it be. Legitimate transactions have an advantage that they can simply double-spend when they get caught as a false positive. And that's only necessary if *every single miner* has that false positive - which should be rather unlikely since miners are supposed to be doing their own spam filtering policies.


Their own maybe, at the expense of everyone else...
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:05:09
Depends on the miners. If they cooperate with the UASF, pre-UASF nodes will just continue to work fine. If they fight it, pre-UASF nodes will diverge from UASF nodes, and we will have a chain split. A UASF aims to put economic pressure on miners to cooperate. It's important that a majority of the economy enforces the UASF therefore.
Note that it's economic activity, not absolute node counts, that matter. This is why UASF is sybil-resistant.
@_date: 2017-04-18 16:59:05

Unlike other software, UASF makes *no changes to the consensus protocol under any circumstances* until a given flag day is reached. So arguably, it doesn't alter the consensus protocol until 2 hours prior to Aug 1.
As others have pointed out, segwit clearly does have overwhelming majority support.
Also, IMO it would be better to err in favour of allowing it when there is a reasonable possibility overwhelming consensus might exist.

I'm neutral in the actual block size debate, but I think it would be ideal to wait until we've used up most of the 1 MB blocks, which I expect will realistically be a few decades from now (with Lightning reducing the load), or at the earliest about 2 years (without any progress, which is unlikely). Right now, after 6 years of Bitcoin, there's only about 350 kB/block of actual transaction volume, and that's including microtransactions.

Not really. You could put segwit transactions on an extension block, but it'd still be segwit. There's also no value in doing it that way, and lots of downsides.


We're not ready for a block size increase at all, so BIP141's 2 MB is more than enough. If the 4 MB worst-case-scenario is concerning, we can softfork in a new 2 or 3 MB block size limit.


BIP 141 makes sense. Hardforks might make sense if we ever need more than 2 MB. If BIP 141 wasn't possible and we needed &gt;1 MB, a hardfork is still preferable over an extension block.

It was increased from 250k to 750k at the end of 2013 by Mike Hearn, Gavin, and Jeff Garzik. The original pull request said "Increase default -blockmaxsize/prioritysize to **300K**/30K", but nobody else noticed when it got changed to 750k.
Since then, miners have (finally!) decided to stop using the defaults and set it to 1 MB. It's a good thing that this policy decision is being made by miners now, but unfortunately, they aren't really doing their due diligence in deciding a *good* policy.

Hardforks aren't too risky, but they do have risks, and are complicated to coordinate. The community has decided not to do any for now.


All bugs/attacks can be fixed with a softfork.

Yes, developers had unlimited time, or at least spare time. As things are, we're overworked because there's too few of us. :(


It's not true. Segwit is actually better as a softfork than a hardfork. There's maybe a minor tweak or two that might make sense in a hardfork, but it wouldn't make sense to change segwit significantly.

Yes, a block size increase today essentially alienates a large number of people from being able to use Bitcoin.


Miners perform the DMMS on the blockchain, which is entirely unaffected by block size.


They have expressed they want a larger block size, but that is different from actually willing a larger block size after considering the trade-offs. If they *were* actively willing the block size to be larger despite those trade-offs, it would probably be accomplished and done by now.

Yes, as is everyone working on Bitcoin. Consensus systems *are not like* the older technology you are comparing it to, and the same problems and solutions are not applicable. This is an entirely new field of computer science.

A better analogy would be shrinking the highway lanes so there are more lanes in the same area. Sure, you can now fit/move 4 vehicles side-by-side instead of 3, but you've just effectively banned a large number of vehicles that no longer can fit in the lanes at all.
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:37:44
No, as long as you shutdown Bitcoin Core cleanly, you can upgrade or go back to 0.10.x without any problem. Note if your PC ever loses power, you may need to reprocess the data (which is where most of the time is spent), so if it takes weeks for you to do so (sounds like an ancient PC), you may want to be careful to avoid that by setting up a UPS.

But a miner could create a block that would fork it off, due to the 2013 May hardfork.
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:49:33
They are not mutually exclusive. It is completely possible to remove the block size increase from SegWit. It's not as nice, and doesn't address the problems with the 2 MB HF itself, but there are no *new* problems created by doing both.

One mechanism discussed was 95% indication by miners that they observe economic adoption. It is explicitly *not* miners voting as themselves, but as representative of the entire community. also brought up possibly wallet/PoS indicators as a guide for miners to determine economic support, but that may or may not be too complicated.

Not good enough. I'd want Bitmain to sell all (or at least close to it) their miners at below-break-even prices (cloud hashing sales don't count). We don't have PoW so that we depend on trusting a centralised miner, we have it so we don't *need* to trust.
@_date: 2016-02-12 23:13:01




Yes, and that should work ... for non-controversial hardforks. But when there's controversy, that means people *have chosen to reject the change*, and suddenly the situation gets a lot more complicated.


If it's uncontroversial, no voting is necessary. If it is controversial, no amount of voting can be force the vote results on those rejecting the change.


How are you going to force those opposed to a hardfork, to accept the PoS-made decision?
@_date: 2016-02-09 04:34:11
Most of the spam these days seem to be simply trying to force the block size larger, but others are trying to use the blockchain as a way to force others to host data for them, and still some others are abusing it as a form of messaging.
Regular full nodes *can* filter spam, but inevitably if a miner puts it in a block, everyone is required to download and process it, so that's the primary place filtering is supposed to happen.
@_date: 2017-04-09 18:14:30
The only secure wallets are Core and derivatives (like Knots). There are no universally compatible passphrases, period.

It's the most accurate possible at the moment (albeit still fairly imprecise). Note that dynamic IPs typically only change once every month at most - the hypothetical "dynamic ip that changes every 24 hours" is rare at best.
Current measurements put it at just under 50k, however, not the 97k shown a few weeks ago. This change is the result of excluding IPv6, since IPv4 and IPv6 overlap a lot (and everyone has IPv4, while IPv6 is more easily gamed).
@_date: 2017-04-10 23:02:33
If it's set to 4 MB, it can't be increased beyond that without a hardfork. (Or a new extension block, which is not really the same thing)

Are you trolling? You do realise Segwit isn't just a block size increase, right? It made many improvements. The block size increase was just a harmful compromise.
It's possible the real improvements helped the price, but to claim it was the block size increase is ridiculous.
And no, I'm not contradicting myself. While smaller blocks themselves wouldn't affect price, the fact that Bitcoin is acting to improve could.

Users can store spam all they want, so if they want a "spam folder" they can certainly add one. I agree that *IF* miners become centralised, Bitcoin as a whole has failed (in more ways than just this) -  but miners choosing what goes through *their* pipes onto the blockchain is quite "libertarian", and relying on miners to do the spam filtering is *necessary* for a working system at all.

As in not breaking from the community consensus. But yes, it is defined in the agreement by compatibility with Core.

maxmempool defaults to (IIRC) 200 or 300 in 0.12, and did not exist in 0.11.2 (so effectively unlimited).
blockprioritysize defaults to 0 in 0.12 (I strongly disagree with this change, since the evidence suggests 0 is risky), and 50000 in 0.11.2 and earlier.

Just upgrade to a newer release of Bitcoin Core or Knots. If you don't have enough disk space, enable pruning.
As always, keep your backups updated!
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:30:29
Just reasonable values to (for maxmempool) avoid not having transactions to mine after finding a block, and (for blockprioritysize) to avoid spam-only blocks by balancing it out with priority.
Ideally, miners should experiment and figure out what they like best for the exact values.
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:59:10
Because the cost of increasing the limit is lower than the benefits of peace/not constant fighting and showing that Bitcoin can in fact do a hardfork.
@_date: 2016-02-15 04:27:24

In addition to what said, there is no reasonable way for you to know who sent bitcoins to you, unless you give them a unique payment address. I'm guessing if you've used the same one for 2 years, you must have only been receiving payments right after you discussed it with someone, and assumed the payment was from them.

Segwit blocks can include both segwit and non-segwit transactions together just fine.
But to make a segwit block, you need segwit-capable mining software. After segwit activated, Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 would only support segwit-capable mining software, and all non-segwit mining software would just fail. To continue mining with non-segwit mining sw, you would need to downgrade to 0.13.0. But 0.14.1 supports non-segwit mining software even after segwit activates.

To keep Bitcoin a decentralised system. Right now, we *cannot* handle regular 1 MB blocks - that must become an unusual/outlier case until we either can or need it.

@_date: 2015-07-29 08:18:42


Well, for wallet development miners could set the soft limit low enough to create the fee pressure without spam; or we could wait until we hit the 1 MB limit (but this is dangerous if developers are too slow). Or we could wait to address it until the (many) other more important shortcomings are addressed...
Of course, this doesn't put the fire under the miners... The best idea for that I've come up with is a centrally controlled (eg, multisig) hard limit, but because that's centralised I wouldn't want to seriously suggest it.
@_date: 2015-07-09 02:35:20
I'm not sure what it will take.
Eligius (the pool I started) has been well-behaving since nearly the start, and I intentionally chose someone to pass it off to who I knew would continue that tradition.
BitMinter's operator has expressed that he is explicitly *choosing* to use the default policy - which isn't a differentiator, but at least it's an improvement over the negligence of not making a choice.
F2Pool, as we all know, has been experimenting with new policies as of late as well.
BTCChina tells me they have Bitcoin's interests as a high priority, but I haven't discussed with them how that relates to their mining policies.
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:01:10
There's no obviously-right way to react. It destroys the notion of decentralised consensus - at what point do we all stop listening to reorganisations? Note that checkpoints are *not* a lock-in mechanism, and that behaviour is actually a bug in Bitcoin Core (which will hopefully be fixed in 0.12).

Hashrate doesn't matter for hardforks. Either all the *users* consent, or it isn't possible.
IMO the only way we should even consider a (further\*) compromise, is if it breaks Bitmain's centralised mining monopoly. Let them sell *all* their miners indiscriminately, and establish efforts to prove on an ongoing basis that they have no influence over mining.

6 blocks takes on average 1 hour. But confirmation begins only after the first miner includes the transaction in his block. So if it pays too little a fee, you may be waiting days (or forever, if it's ridiculously low).


Blocks are on average one every ten minutes - but that's just an average, and blocks don't necessarily include all transactions right away. 1 hour between blocks happens maybe 2 or 3 times every week.

Extension blocks are just mandatory sidechains. At the simplest level, you'd have the same transactions in either the base block or the extension block, but there's been some talk about only allowing segwit transactions in the extension block, and not in the base block. The only time it really makes sense, however, is when the extension block is a fundamentally different format, such as RootStock or MimbleWimble which don't use UTXOs for state at all.
@_date: 2017-04-17 12:40:12
Segwit is the ideal solution for what it aims to accomplish, so there is no sane alternative to it, and I don't foresee anything better coming around.
There's no rational argument for extension blocks today. The only time they might make sense is when they provide a fundamentally different paradigm to Bitcoin, such as RootStock or MimbleWimble. It *never* makes sense to use them to increase block sizes.

Miners have no say in hardforks, so frankly this is a complete non-issue. In any case, we have no authority to decide to schedule a hardfork, nor the power to enforce one.


It is the implementation that needs consensus, not the abstract idea.


Because there is literally nothing to gain from a [block size limit] hardfork, at this time. We also, *despite being the least-unqualified*, are also still incompetent to coordinate a hardfork. Research to become capable is planned for after SegWit is done. (note that Satoshi himself said they were outright impossible originally, and only barely scratched the surface of making them possible before he left)

It's a simple addition of a rule "If the block's "median time" is after &lt;day&gt;, it must signal segwit". It's cleanest with maybe 5-10 lines of code, but could be done in 1.

Jeff's claim here appears to be that Core had previously implemented a policy of setting mining-policy defaults such that fee pressure was kept to a minimum.
However, I am not aware that was *ever* the case. It seems to me the policy was to increase default mining-policy limits *as necessary*, and not related in any sense to fee pressure. Whatever you personally think the defaults should be here, it is not a certainty that the soft limit *needs* to be changed at this point (in fact, it seems to the contrary, it should *not* be increased).
Furthermore, we have been trying to stress the need of miners to configure policy on their own for a while.

Yes, you're missing that blockchain-transactions are not the same thing as bitcoin transactions; and that there are serious downsides to larger block sizes. More blockchain-transactions does not improve scalability significantly, and most bitcoin transactions already occur off-chain. Work is being done to make off-chain transactions just as trustless as the blockchain (Lightning), which basically means unlimited tx/s with just 1 MB blocks (tx/s replaced with a limited number of users per year far beyond what we're likely to see this decade). But both blockchain-transactions and Lightning-transactions *depend on* the blockchain being accessible to everyone. Larger blocks put that out of reach.
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:59:55
Not really, no. Until it's mined, it can always be double-spent. The only way to get zero confirmation is Lightning. But really, most transactions shouldn't *need* confirmation.

@_date: 2017-04-27 16:06:57
Merely having a merkle proof doesn't prove that the block as a whole is valid. For this, the idea was for SPV to use "fraud proofs" where full nodes would prove invalid blocks are invalid. This can work *so long as the invalid block is well-formed and known*. But there is no reason an attacker would use a well-formed block, so this breaks down quickly. Furthermore, it is possible to make a perfectly valid block that will never be accepted, simply by obscuring any small part of the block so full nodes can never validate the entire block.

Eligius tends to proactively avoid mining spam, and quite often goes beyond the usual soft limits to clear spam-induced backlogs. So hopefully not too long. You can also just pay a higher fee than the spam to ensure it gets mined preferentially even when there is a backlog.

SegWit doesn't change storage of any data, merely changes the way [segwit-enabled] transactions are hashed for the txid. Currently, all transactions are hashed by serially going over the version, inputs, signatures, and outputs. New transactions are instead exclude signatures from the hashing, so that the txid does not change if [only] the signature is modified. Because old nodes only understand the old method of hashing the transaction, the signatures effectively become invisible to them, and they don't count it against their "block size limit" rule, but they're still part of the real block itself.
If nobody uses SegWit, then none of the signatures are invisible to old nodes, so the entire size must be counted by old nodes and no gains in the limit are accomplished. So the expanded block space can only be used by wallets which upgrade - but hold-outs don't reduce the gains for anyone else. But for any hardfork, 100% of software must be upgraded or the change fails entirely, so this "partial upgrade" situation is strictly better with SegWit.

Curiously, the logic exchanges put forward would suggest that without replay protection, they must support the UASF side, not the non-UASF side. The reason is that the non-UASF side is vulnerable to a replay of the UASF chain, but not vice-versa. The reason this is different from BU, is that BU is a hardfork, whereas UASF is a softfork.

That's an assumption Bitcoin relies on, at least so long as miners refuse to act as spam filters.

There is no such thing as a sending address. Bitcoin does not convey the sender of a transaction at all.
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:32:08
Not much more. It also increases the attack damage significantly.
To make it much more expensive to sustain the attacks *without* increasing damage, miners should reduce their block size close to the actual transaction volume, and users should outbid spam as necessary (raising the minimum fee).
@_date: 2015-07-12 06:54:52


The problem is that when you filter a spam pattern, the spammers will eventually adapt and make the old filter worthless. This isn't really well-suited to reference code in most cases, so it is usually maintained separately (eg, I have a "spamfilter" branch that gets a lot of it).


[The new -limitunconfdepth I wrote]( might be general enough to help in the long-term and therefore suitable for merging.

No, it isn't. At least in the US, most dynamic IPs change maybe once a month at most.
Furthermore, 24 hours is too short a time period for accurate measurements. Many people don't run their nodes every day.

731 kB is far higher than it needs to be, and isn't anti-social at all. How about you stop telling miners to do stupid things? If anything, they should reduce their soft limits to 300-400 kB since they're presumably failing to filter modern spam properly.

The concept of an OP_RETURN data carrier was created so spammers had a way to do *less damage* than disguising their spam as ordinary transactions. If we "abolish" it, they will likely just go back to the more damaging kind.

Correct, the only way to identify who sent you bitcoins, is based on the address they sent to. That is, if you give me address 1foobar and Fred 1barbaz, you can reasonably assume anything you receive with 1foobar is from me, and anything you receive with 1barbaz is from Fred. This is why when you create an address, you are given the opportunity to set a label for it to indicate its particular purpose.

Before segwit, each transaction is: TxVersion Input1 Signature1 Input2 Signature2 Input3 Signature3 ... Output1 Output2 ... LockTime
Segwit transactions are instead: TxVersion Input1 Input2 Input3 ... Output1 Output2 ... Signature1 Signature2 Signature3 ... LockTime
Ordering the data this way makes it easy to skip over them or strip them out. This is important for segwit because the txid is computed by skipping over signatures (that's what fixes malleability). It's also optimal for backward compatibility with old nodes, and light clients which can't verify signatures anyway (even today).

BCC and BCU are centralised currencies that promise to pay out in BTC and BTU at the end of some pre-agreed-on timespan (end of 2017 IIRC). Bitfinex issues 1 BCC and 1 BCU in exchange for 1 pre-fork BTC. This allows trading the two on their market prior to the actual fork. The downside is that your coins are stuck in Bitfinex (and you're trusting them to keep them secure) until the actual fork occurs.

I don't see how a temporary lightweight mode really helps IBD. New nodes *still* need to sync the entire blockchain eventually, and that continues to grow unbounded in data transfer and CPU time.
UTXO scanning will no doubt be helpful, but it doesn't enable rescanning the blockchain, in particularly loading the history of wallets. So if you had to restore from a backup, you'd probably lose out on data. The only time UTXO scanning really helps is when importing or sweeping private keys (the former of which users shouldn't be doing in the first place). What would be more useful to solve rescanning, IMO, would be making real-time full remote backups for every single change, encrypting it first with key(s) in the HD wallet chain, so any restore automatically can recover the full wallet metadata.
Agreed that block relay latency (where CB helps) is *probably* solved (although I haven't seen hard data demonstrating it yet - I think we need to get miners to disable FIBRE to show it has?).

Nobody with a clue would say 75% majority hard forks are safe. At best, it's an unknown (which is not "safe"). More importantly, the only way such a hardfork can succeed is the *violence* of depriving people of usage of their property/bitcoins, so it is likely unethical regardless of the outcome.

No, Lightning is secure so long as you run a full node for the blockchain or trust someone else to (note this is also true of using Bitcoin today!). The real risks are:
* Some amount of your bitcoins must be online to receive payment. If your wallet/PC is insecure, a cracker could break in and steal these. (Lightning is incompatible with offline wallets.)
* If one of your channel-buddies disappears or is malicious, he can freeze some portion of your funds for a few days/weeks (depending on your configuration). After that time, you will still have all your money that you should.
* If the majority of miners are malicious and targeting you, they can steal your Lightning-enabled funds with cooperation from your channel-buddies.
@_date: 2016-02-22 00:10:27




During the time from Miner X finding a block, until Miner Y receives that block, Miner Y is wasting work, giving an attacker an advantage and cutting into Miner Y's income. Miner Y can solve this by becoming 51% thus shifting the problem unevenly on to everyone else. (This is de facto what the Chinese mining pools are doing today.)
The time between Miner X and Miner Y is mostly dependent on the average full node's ability to relay the blocks to numerous peers quickly. For 1 MB to be relayed to 8 peers over 30 seconds (which is really too slow already), you need 2.2 Mbps upload. Right now, nodes also need to verify the block before they begin relaying it - that alone can add numerous tens of seconds.
A workaround to this used today, is a centralised backbone for miners. This, however, is not an acceptable solution because it is not permissionless, and necessarily centralised (enabling, among other things, censorship by the backbone operator).

Note the proponents of increasing the block size (particularly Gavin and Mike) are explicitly denying miners can *ever* be supported by transaction fees in their vision for how they want to change Bitcoin.
Lightning *requires* the blockchain to work. That means everyone using Lightning needs\* to be running a full node. It also means everyone using Lightning needs to pay appropriate transaction fees to miners when they perform settlements (which are between users, not banks). Since these settlements occur every few months, and collapse away many other transactions, the settlement blockchain-transaction can afford pay a fee much higher than any current one-blockchain-tx-per-real-tx does. This then makes it practical for miners to set reasonably high blockchain-tx fees - maybe something like $30/kB (approximately equivalent to today's block rewards). So in the end, you get something like unlimited transactions for $60/year.
In the meantime, this also solves the spam problem, because spammers will [hopefully] not be able to compete with these higher blockchain fees.
Edit: Forgot to add this:

**Faster**: A hardfork *necessarily requires that every single Bitcoin node be updated* whether they want to take advantage of it or not. If that takes years, *then the hardfork cannot trigger or have any effect until those years pass*. SegWit gets an increase immediately for those who do choose to upgrade.
**Safer**: If a hardfork doesn't have consensus, it becomes an altcoin and the economy, miners, and community are split. Even with consensus, it leaves outdated nodes vulnerable to attack. SegWit doesn't have the potential to cause any of these problems.
**Consentual**: The only way to resolve a contentious hardfork, is for one group to literally force the other group into submission. SegWit allows everyone to freely make up their own mind, without such violence.

This requires more resources from peers, so it potentially creates a DoS risk. It is also incompatible with mempool trimming, so flood attacks would continue to overflow memory without bound. Basically it is impractical to use.


Yes, this is the *centralised and censorable* workaround I mentioned.


These are possibly ways we can improve the network's ability to handle larger blocks. But still theoretical and not ready yet. Hopefully once these are proven sound and implemented, it will be safe for bigger blocks.


Transactions are not encrypted at all.


Spam often uses patterns that ordinary transactions do not use.


I don't think this is a real thing to be concerned about. Everyone competent is focussed on improving Bitcoin. If people move to broken altcoins, then breaking Bitcoin isn't going to help - it will just mean the world is not ready for decentralised currency.


If there was actually a problem right now, then maybe, but after 7 years we are only at 40% capacity and unlikely to grow the remaining 60% much quicker. Scaling improvements are on track to be complete long before the improvements needed to get mass adoption.


Altcoins do not pose any threat, IMO, unless Bitcoin loses its way and becomes centralised.

Not really. The SW SF is pretty elegant already. The reason the HF is based on it, is because SW is the cleanest way to fix some serious problems of just increasing the block size.

Once it's in a (segwit) block, every block after that (even non-segwit) still builds on the security. So the time it's confirmed (8+ blocks) is likely to be about the same, since it would be delayed by maybe only 1 or 2 blocks out of the 8.

Softforks add new rules. Hardforks remove existing rules. Because rules are firm, hardforks effectively are a new altcoin that propose everyone adopt it as the "new Bitcoin".
To impose a lower block size limit, you can simply add a rule (softfork).
To add a new opcode, it depends on what it does: if it only makes transactions using it conditionally invalid, it can be softforked (this is why new opcodes tend to be `*VERIFY` variants). If it can be used in a manner where an existing invalid transaction becomes valid, however, that makes it a hardforking change.

* Namecoin: Serves a purpose that Bitcoin does not target (key/value database)
* Freicoin: Fundamentally incompatible economic innovations (demurrage)

I don't think Lightning makes the situation for a non-Bitcoin/node-user any *worse*, but the situation with such a setup really is no better than PayPal. To get the advantages/trustlessness/security of Bitcoin, you simply *must* run a full node, both today and also with Lightning. Furthermore, if at some point the economic majority is *not* using a full node, then Bitcoin literally fails completely even for the minority who still have such a node. :(
This is why it is *crucial* to keep the blockchain decentralised and within full-node-reach for as many people as possible. Everything Bitcoin depends on it.
@_date: 2016-02-11 07:13:46
Yes, overall good news.
@_date: 2016-02-22 15:35:20


"Wealth" transfer is the only thing the users of Bitcoin have universally consented to (implicitly). Anything else is therefore spam. (Of course, nothing stops sidechains from serving these otherwise-spam use cases fairly.)


Core cannot raise it. That's something the community must decide.


Bitcoin was designed to *intentionally not be* turing complete. Turing completeness isn't a feature, it's a liability.
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:19:05


Not quite. Segwit without a size increase does lose the benefit of incentives to adopt it (witness data would no longer be discounted).
Regardless of segwit, a 2 MB HF also loses the benefits that are currently "accidental" in the 1 MB block size; particularly the effective limit on UTXO growth. A hardforked block size increase doubles the UTXO growth limit (in addition to the block size), whereas SegWit's block size increase leaves the UTXO growth at the same limit.


I agree. If there was consensus for the HF, we even *should* do it that way, simply because it isn't our decision to make as developers. However, the HF supporters appear to have no interest in getting consensus beyond their tiny niche, and just want to force it on everyone else.


Notwithstanding what I just said, I do still agree the roadmap is indeed the *technically best* plan proposed so far.
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:31:01
What are your thoughts on proceeding with the fork, but miners continuing to make &lt;1 MB blocks until adoption requires an increase?
I'm suggesting organising better objections, because if it becomes clear a large amount of the community opposes it, it cannot happen (at least beyond segwit).
(Or do you oppose segwit's increase as well?)
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:06:08
So unblock it
@_date: 2016-02-21 22:32:00
At the moment, consensus literally *is* compatibility with Core, because that is what the community in general uses. It is not foreseeable that this situation will change, so when/if it ever does, the "foreseeable future" has ended, and they would not be bound to remain compatible with it.
@_date: 2016-02-09 02:48:53
Current usage is approx 400k/block. The blocks are bigger because we have 400-500k/block worth of non-financial spam bloating them. The spam is literally *unlimited* and will just as easily fill a 2 MB block as it fills a 1 MB block. 2 MB is safe *only* if miners start doing a better job filtering the spam - if they don't, we will immediately see 2 MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:04:59
Ah, I see.
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:21:11
It's of so little relevance that it might as well be. What really matters is using it to receive your own transactions.

@_date: 2017-04-20 14:50:46
Well, that's not true. Segwit changes the data structure of transactions (not blocks), but signatures remain a part of the transaction (and as such, the block). There is no "extended block" with segwit.

If you're not running a full node at home, you're not a real Bitcoin user. Without a full node, you literally might as well be using PayPal.

@_date: 2017-04-18 18:14:14
If you don't validate the extblock, you're not a full node. It's the equivalent of a softfork's "outdated node", and no more secure than a light client. This false impression of a middle ground that doesn't really exist is part of the problem with extension blocks.

Of course, none of this changes the fact that miners don't decide hardforks...
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:19:48
We had no problem with consensus for the last/only hardfork. I'm sure there are other hardforks we can achieve it with as well. There are serious ethical problems with anything short of consensus; Eric is completely correct that such a thing is literally theft.
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:05:41
It doesn't reduce transaction sizes at all. It increases the block size limit.
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:29:15
Core has a stricter Q/A process whereby each release must be independently built by at least 3 people before being codesigned, and then another 3 codesigning builds verified before it is publicly posted.
I post Knots releases as soon as my own build is complete, and so far we haven't done codesigning of them. (This may change as number of gitian builders increases.)
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:54:07
They're not really solutions at all.
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:02:10
It's simply mathematically impossible for the stripped block to exceed 1 MB, since all data not excluded counts at 4 WU/byte.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:31:14
Dishonest bet. It only resolves in favour of segwit under very limited cases.
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:52:52
Miners are recommended to include the witness merkle root even prior to segwit activation, to test that their code is generating it correctly. It's not consensus-enforced until segwit activates, but if wrong it is possible to detect and correct.
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:04:22
UASF won't result in a long-term network split like a HF. Assuming UASF has economic support, miners will have no choice but to comply, and once &gt;50% do, it will bring non-UASF nodes back into consensus with the UASF network.
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:35:35
Then think about it more... I don't know how it can be any clearer.
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:22:53
How are they going to force miners choosing to use "BU pool", to switch to different alternative pools after they split it?
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:32:07
It seems from what I know so far, that it's in the public hardware as well, but not enabled.
@_date: 2016-02-20 20:54:24
Yes, that's why 1 MB block size is too big.
@_date: 2012-12-09 20:50:51
Yes, the gambling is just a side effect, since it can be done just as well without the DDoS. I hear (though I haven't investigated) bitbattle.me is a good example of SatoshiDice-style gambling without the DDoS attack.
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:34:38
Developers have no power - there is literally nothing more we can do. Softforks can only be activated by users. Historically, users have outsourced it to miners for convenience, but there is no need for that.
@_date: 2016-02-11 07:36:49
Commitments? What are we expected to commit to? A hardfork is not something we can decide, it is up to the entire community.
SegWit is currently scheduled for Q2. IMO makes more sense to spend more time addressing how to hardfork safely *after* that's done, rather than delay it.
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:59:15
It would make sense to deploy both UASFs at the same time, if we're doing UASF Segwit. (The other UASF being the covert-AsicBoost fix.)

@_date: 2017-04-18 16:12:27
No, there isn't. There's technical challenges to doing so (existing ideas either break pruning, or use a *lot* more data), and political challenges (our Chinese miner "overlords" are opposed to privacy).

Not really, I just came up with more effective workarounds.
@_date: 2016-09-25 22:10:00
You could try upgrading. But be sure to make a backup of your wallet first (use the menu's Backup Wallet option).
@_date: 2015-07-28 06:50:06
Private keys aren't the only important thing, either. Holding your own private keys only does so much if you're trusting a third-party with your full node.

Not quite. I argued that it is *possible* to wait until we hit congestion, to dis-spell FUD about it being imminent - I do not think we actually *should* wait *if* we know it is coming. I've also said that it is not something that needs critical attention *until* we encounter *early signs* that we might soon reach it, but that has not happened yet.


Sorry, I dropped that thread, partly because it seemed you were ignoring the reality that Bitcoin and VISA simply cannot be treated the same way. Since it was long I didn't get to the edited in question - 's response to that is more or less correct, with a caveat I will address below in this comment.


(Looks like one of many wallet bugs in "third-party" wallets.)






The payment protocol (which is intended to replace addresses, at least for merchant use) intentionally conveys the blockchain transaction to the merchant out-of-band, and places the responsibility on the merchant to get it mined. This also includes the merchant being able to specify the transaction fee (deducted from the payment amount). If the transaction leaves the intermediate state, it is because the sender has double-spent/disputed it; otherwise, the merchant should continue to rebroadcast it until it is mined.
While Bitcoin cannot *guarantee* it being mined, this mostly restores the VISA-like behaviour. Merchants and processors can, however, negotiate such a guarantee with large miners to eventually mine their payment transactions under certain conditions (which may involve CPFP).

What? All this time the big spam DoS attack was this newbie playing around?
/s :p
But on a serious note: ignore the "blockchain explorers"; none of them are sanely designed, and all of them will confuse you if you just want to use Bitcoin. Do your experimenting and testing on the test network, not with real bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-07-01 03:26:08
Maybe you should be more honest with your friend, and explain there is in fact no transaction limit...
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:51:21
That's not relevant to my point. If we had consensus for a hardfork, we could deploy 2 MB HF tomorrow, and SegWit (without a block size increase) the day after.
Disclaimer: I am not saying this is a good idea nor that it is practical to achieve such consensus on a short term, only that it is *theoretically possible*.

No, because EC is more broad than just UASF. At least in BU's definition. (Note I've agreed with "EC" statements in the past based on a more accurate definition of EC which isn't so problematic.)

@_date: 2016-09-23 09:09:43
Transactions don't originate from addresses at all.
In any case, you can broadcast whenever. Just be aware that you may need to re-issue the transaction if the first one is changed before confirming. (And if the double-spend doesn't go to you, re-issuing safely may be impossible...)

I don't think Lightning is mature enough to confirm how wallets will implement it at the API level yet.
@_date: 2012-08-06 20:45:59
There are 2,100,000,000,000,000 units of the Bitcoin currency. People just work with "BTC" (100,000,000 units) to make life easier right now. Eventually, people will move to mBTC (100,000 units) and then μBTC (100 units) or TBC (1,0000 units in base 8*2).
@_date: 2016-09-01 18:28:52
No, it is correct. Things working "good enough" by accident *sometimes* does not mean the behaviour is supported. If you send to the same address twice, you *could* very well be burning bitcoins, and it is nobody's fault but your own.
@_date: 2016-02-20 22:02:56
It's a compromise, not a farce. But we can only speak for ourselves - we cannot force the community to accept anything. We will uphold the part we agreed to, but once that is done, it remains up to the Bitcoin community to decide whether to deploy it or not.
@_date: 2016-09-26 02:30:02
Never. You can't usefully detect double spending.
But Lightning will bring instant confirmation...

@_date: 2016-09-10 03:59:17
That's the beauty of Lightning. Simple payment channels are many-tx-with-the-same-peers, but Lightning forms a circuit/network between everyone, so it's no longer limited in that manner and can be used for all transactions between any two parties.

Then you're playing word games by redefining these terms to what they don't mean.
Capitalism gives the owner of the tools the power to define the value of everyone else's contributions, and typically treats all the real contributors (ie, labourors) as mere "human resources" (rather than people) to be exploited at the cheapest possible cost.
Socialism (or more accurately, communism) is more or less the same, but enforces that the State is always the tool-owner.

Blocks claim a timestamp, and if nodes think it's absurd they reject it. At the very least, it must be newer than the median timestamp of the previous 11 blocks, and typically nodes insist it not be more than 2 hours into the future from their own clock.

Electrum isn't secure, and doesn't benefit from Bitcoin's security. Basically you're just trusting some random server as you would PayPal or a bank.

It doesn't reveal your private keys, but it does reveal your addresses, which at the very least compromises all your privacy.

It's not happening. I've seen no evidence there is more than maybe 10 people (with a lot of sockpuppets) who actually\* support it.
\* To be clear, by this I mean someone who both understands the proposal (including the contrast with SegWit) and is willing to deploy it despite lack of consensus.
If you want to prove me wrong:
* Explicitly say you support forcing a hardfork on the community against its will, to do nothing but BIP 109, despite SegWit's faster, safer, and consentual 2 MB block size increase. (These are *facts* about what Classic aims for; if you dispute them, you don't understand Classic and therefore don't actually support it.)
* Prove you're a real human person and not a sock puppet. I don't really know a way to do this, but I guess a video of yourself explaining your position would be pretty strong evidence.
* Bonus: Somehow show you don't have a conflict of interest. If you're hoping to buy cheap bitcoins from a price crash, or you're paid to support Classic, or you're a spammer or part of a business invested in spamming the blockchain, please just don't bother replying.

I don't think anyone present was suggesting before February 2017. Perhaps if more people help contribute to the R&amp;D for the HF, we can have the code done and tested within a month after SegWit (rather than 3) and push it earlier a bit more...

Actually, it makes it easier.


Where do you live?


Requires far less with Lightning.


No, that's 1.8 MB per block at best (and that's assuming 4 Mbps *upload*, while your number is likely just *download*).
4 ÷ 8 Mbps/MBps ÷ 8 peers to upload to × 30 seconds worst-reasonable time to upload = 1.875 MB
Compact blocks helps a little (by pre-uploading some of the block over the prior 8 minutes), but not enough for 278 MB blocks. And when you spread it out like that, suddenly you're talking about dedicating the entire connection to just Bitcoin - but many people *do* want to do other things online.

@_date: 2012-12-09 19:19:38
Operating a DDoS attack against bitcoin isn't a legitimate business. The primary effect of SatoshiDice is to harm the Bitcoin network by flooding it with transactions. Bitcoin was designed to resist this kind of attack by having miniscule transaction fees on transactions that look like flooding. SatoshiDice has accomplished using social engineering to bypass this protection by fooling gamblers into covering the expenses of performing the attack. Since these fees exist only as counter-flooding measures right now, they don't cover anywhere near the real cost of the flooding - so NO, people cannot say "they pay the cost" (nevermind that SatoshiDice isn't paying it - it's fooling gamblers into doing it). If you had fees cover the actual cost of transactions today, you would easily find the fees would likely be well over 5-10%.
A SatoshiDice-like legitimate gambling site using Bitcoin would have deposits and withdrawls, and do all the betting on-site without touching the blockchain. The blockchain is meant for actual transfers, NOT SERIALIZING ACTIONS. What SatoshiDice is doing, is the equivalent of WalMart using TWO separate transactions every time you decide to take an item off the shelf and put it in your cart. Not even VISA or any of the established big networks could handle this absurd abuse - to expect Bitcoin to do so on basically volunteer infrastructure is ridiculous.

If you wish to use a reimplementation for accepting Bitcoin payments, I highly recommend running an unmodified Bitcoin Core node in parallel to double-check things, and treat all transactions as unconfirmed if there's a discrepancy until you have a chance to verify what's going on manually.

Just keep in mind that without a full node, you're not using Bitcoin.
The problem is when more people receive bitcoins, but don't use Bitcoin themselves, merely trusting some other entity. More PayPal-like "usage" = bad.

Bitcoin Knots is for Bitcoin, like Bitcoin Core is.
@_date: 2016-09-05 05:22:37
This creates an attack scenario where the malicious miner just needs to find one very-hard block to trump 2 or more honest blocks, causing potentially massive reorganisations. It could work for the top block, but would incentivise certain dishonest mining methods (for example, refuse to accept a block with a just-barely-enough hash if it has a nice fee you want for yourself, and hope you find a better hash before the next block).

In a normal closing, the fee is paid by the person who wishes to close the channel. (Or potentially by anyone else involved - even indirectly - using CPFP, but that's not really Lightning-specific.)
If someone tries to commit fraud, and the channel is closed by preventing such fraud, the fraudster's entire channel balance can be used as the closing fee (or kept by the would-be victim, if there is excess in his judgement).
@_date: 2016-09-08 21:08:35
Person A would need to reissue the first transaction with the additional outputs as a RBF doublespend. This is reasonable and desirable behaviour.
Lightning also does basically this in a much more complex manner (it can cut-through multiple parties).

It's not enough to merely download each block over 10 minutes. The entire block needs to be relayed across *all* nodes in a timely manner for mining to be decentralised. To achieve this, the typical node must be able to relay to numerous peers in a matter of seconds - a worst case scenario would be 8 peers in under 30 seconds. So for 32 MB blocks, that'd be over 8 MB (64 Mbit) per second *upload*. Most of the world can't get anywhere near that much bandwidth, no matter how much they pay.

It's possible to approximate, at least.
Sufficient decentralisation can be quantified as:
* For 85% of economic activity, the receiving party is using their own full node.

* No more than 30% of hashrate is controlled or located under the jurisdiction of a single government.

Bitcoin addresses can only be used once. So with this kind of "paper wallet", you can only make a single deposit ever. I never recommend this kind of "paper wallet", because it is impractical to use without losing money.

It would have all the same problems, and more since blocks would conflict more often. Furthermore, it doesn't mean faster confirmations: while you might get 6 blocks faster, this is counter-acted by the higher collision rate and other similar factors.

Not speaking for Blockstream, but decentralised sidechains are essentially the same as federated sidechains, except using miners as the federation. But since you don't know who the miners are, and cannot sue them if they misbehave, this is only safe if mining is sufficiently decentralised. That isn't the case today.

@_date: 2019-01-07 17:35:58
There's no reason miners need to search every nonce. Quite often, mining chips divide the 32 bits among their cores. So if there's 200 cores, they'll give each core 24 bits, with the core having the remaining 8 bits set at a fixed number. With 200 cores, this means those 8 bits will always be 0-199 and never get values from 200-255.

Yes, this is crucial, or new users *won't be able* to fire up new nodes, thus compromising the security of the network.


There is no such thing as "all the full nodes we would ever need". It's not an absolute number of nodes needed, but a proportion of the economy. At least a supermajority of economic activity must verify received transactions using a full node of their own, or the network security itself is compromised.


Full nodes aren't required to store the blockchain.


There are no other real cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-01-14 01:59:19
The network doesn't need anywhere near as many archival nodes, as it does full nodes.

Bitcoin itself doesn't support anonymous usage, so no.

Liquid peg-outs are a simple multisig, so AFAIK you don't gain any real security from running a full node.
Disclaimer: Not speaking for Blockstream.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:43:00
No, I'm saying increasing bandwidth (and drive space, which was never relevant anyway) doesn't enable bigger block sizes. Block sizes are the *rate of increase* of the blockchain size. So bandwidth must increase to safely have blocks at all.

Running a full node is only useful if you use it for your wallet. The system you run it on, provided it is located somewhere you exclusively control (ie, at home), doesn't matter.

Non-mining full nodes are needed to economically enforce the network rules on miners. Without at least a supermajority of the economy enforcing the rules, miners are de facto free to violate them at will, however they feel is best.

You're comparing a rate of change to a rate of acceleration. Resources increase over time. The block*chain* size increases over time. The block size is the rate of change of the blockchain's size. To increase the block size, you are changing a rate of acceleration. But there isn't really a rate of acceleration for the resources.

Removing a SIM card from a phone does not cut it off from the cellular network. All cell phones are always connected when they can access a signal, simply to ensure emergency services can function. The cellular networks could quite conceivably use this avenue to activate the main phone CPU. Using an older phone actually makes this problem worse, as it is only recently that some phones have begun to firewall off the modem CPU - with an old phone, the modem has DMA to the full system RAM. Old phones are also more likely to have known and unpatched vulnerabilities.
Also, camera firmware can have NSA-like exploits just as well as USB firmware...


I wouldn't suggest bringing a hardware wallet outside your home in any case.
(If this were a concern, you'd look for a way to hide a real hardware wallet inside an old phone, while perhaps keeping the phone able to power on. Maybe remove the modem module to make space...)

Bitcoin isn't ready, and readiness doesn't happen overnight. It will take a *lot* of work to get Bitcoin ready for mainstream adoption, and there's really only a few dozen people working on it full time.
So if 20x adoption happened overnight, we'd simply need to eliminate the on-chain transactions that don't need to be on-chain. Probably need to price out spam as well. That may mean transaction fees get much higher.
Complaining that we "have to be ready" doesn't change this reality. Only many thousands of hours of dedicated effort will.

Right. It enables miners to produce unsafely larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-26 18:52:14
It's not possible because even if all current miners abandon one chain, the community can do a PoW change to resolve the halt.
It's not likely all the miners will abandon Bitcoin. Even without any changes, the blocks would just get slower temporarily. So if we had a worst-case scenario of 5% previous hashrate, blocks would be 200 minutes apart for 9 months. This would be comparable to 100k block sizes, so it might be painful until Lightning goes production, but it wouldn't be the end of the ~~world~~ chain. And as soon as miners realise 2X has no support, and they can't sell their 2Xcoins to pay their electric bills, the hashrate will return anyway.

**tl;dr: Pruned nodes contribute basically just as much as non-pruned nodes, so long as you use it.**
The primary way in which nodes help the network, is by the node operator using it to accept payments, and only honouring those payments after his own node shows the transactions confirm.
**Whether the node is listening or not, or archive vs pruned, is irrelevant** to this primary benefit. Overall network security depends on a super-majority of economic activity being received in this way, so it is important that as many people as possible do so.
The benefits provided uniquely by listening and archive nodes is a "just need enough" type thing, and (unlike the security aspect just described) can be provided by datacentres. The network has far more of these nodes than it needs already, so the individual contribution of one is basically irrelevant in the big picture. That is, relaying blocks and transactions isn't really important.

To not enforce all the rules, is essentially an attempt to hardfork those rules away. So you can think of light clients as an attempt to hardfork away *all* the rules, and just give miners full control over the currency (including inflation, theft, etc).

It is much less clear what the outcome would be as we approach and drop below 50%.

For example, if your wallet stops monitoring for 1someaddress coins after 1someaddress has been confirmed as used.

It works only if you spend days downloading and processing the 150 GB blockchain, which is more than most people are willing to do. When more than a small minority use light wallets instead, the security of the entire network is compromised.
Additionally, it works today only by miners cheating (skipping validation) and using centralised backbone relay network(s). In other words, it isn't censorship-resistant either.
Technical progress is only fast enough to account for 300k\block.

There weren't 1 MB blocks 5 years ago. The protocol didn't even allow them.


Yes, which every new user must download. And 100 GB of that is just the last two years. The current growth rate is 50-60 GB per year, and expected to increase to 100-150 GB per year, without any further protocol changes.

Real SPV proposed to do this, but real SPV is impossible. The pseudo-SPV many light wallets use today are *absolutely not* secure.


This is extremely dangerous, and must be prevented for Bitcoin to succeed.


158 GB per year now. This is why we really need a block size decrease.


Bitcoin working at all, and your own security, are pretty strong incentives.


No, but the security of the network as a whole does. Also, the reason SPV node security doesn't decrease specifically is because SPV nodes *don't have security*.

@_date: 2017-10-25 01:21:06
I applaud Coinbase for this policy (although I dislike them calling 2X "Bitcoin &lt;something&gt;").
One thing remains to be clarified: Will users be able to safely deposit both Bitcoin+2X funds to Coinbase *with a single replayed transaction*? For example, if Joe's wallet is entirely unsplit, can Joe send his funds to Coinbase using his regular Bitcoin wallet, and get a deposit credited for both the bitcoins and the associated/replayed 2X funds?
This would require the exchange to simply respect the same deposit addresses on both chains, as valid deposits for the same users. It would also require care to allow for the same txid (on different chains) to appear as multiple deposits.
cc @_date: 2017-10-22 08:04:40

That's backward. If you deposit &gt;=10k *cash*, the bank must make a report. If you seem to be intentionally avoiding &gt;=10k deposits, the law allows the government to just confiscate it all. (And you need to sue them to maybe get it back - you don't get a chance to make a defence.) For this reason, it is pretty much a good idea to make any large cash deposits in over $10k amounts.

So long as you're actually *using* Bitcoin, you act as an economic force against 2X.
Note that using Bitcoin entails 1) running your own full node, 2) using your full node to confirm payments made to you, and 3) actually receiving payments from others that need confirmation.
The economic force is created when you reject an invalid 2X payment. "Sorry, I only accept bitcoins."

Because we were already in a pretty bad place with 1 MB blocks.


Lightning is a decentralised and trustless protocol.


More like non-mining nodes *not even existing*. Storage has never been a concern; bandwidth and CPU time is. Already, we have far too low a fullnode-to-currency-users percentage.


There is no such thing as a "segwit 1mb bitcoin". Segwit increased the block size limit to 2-4 MB already.


Yep. So hopefully they've done 100+ transactions for that fee to make it cost-effective.


Lightning solves this.

It's the public key that's hashed, not the private key. So you need to not only find a collision, but also find a private key for the colliding public key. Good luck with that. :p

The full node provides security when you receive coins. The hardware wallet provides security of coins already received. Given the current risks, the former is more important than the latter - but if you're just holding, and don't plan to receive any new coins, it may make sense to stick to the hardware wallet.
The best option is obviously to use both in combination with each other.

Mining is layer 1 of Bitcoin. But there is a layer zero above that: the protocol itself. This is what *defines* what "mining" means, and what prevents stealing bitcoins and inflation. It is full nodes that implement and enforce layer 0. Any block violating the protocol is simply invalid, and doesn't count no matter how many miners support it.

Strongly disagree. While it would be advisable for exchanges to split coins immediately, they have only agreed to store bitcoins, and should not be obliged in any sense to do or not do anything with random altcoins being introduced.
Exchanges which support both coins should ideally automatically replay any transactions that can be replayed, accept the deposits of both coins, and and then split them.

It's not running a node that helps, but rather refusing to accept fake 2Xcoins as payment (at least when you're expecting to be paid in bitcoins). The only way to be sure you're getting real bitcoins, is to run a full node and use it for your own wallet.

The effort to obtain bitcoins is mostly a function of the market, not mining. Regardless, in terms of mining, the effort is whatever is needed to limit it to 25 BTC every 10 minutes on average. The actual electric cost required is irrelevant.

Bitcoin addresses are tokens for a single payment to be made. They should never be used more than once, and should usually be kept private between the sender and the recipient.
Addresses do not hold or send funds. They have no use after receiving them to your wallet.
Even "current bitcoin address" is confusing language to use, since the address is about a specific transaction, not about your wallet or about you as a person.

The difficulty is implemented by converting the block hash to a very large number, and checking if it is less than the target number. The target number is adjusted with simple math based on the previous block times.
There is no guaranteed mining time, just a target average interval.

For a hardfork to succeed, literally every Bitcoin user must switch/upgrade to the new software supporting it. Since most people oppose 2X, almost nobody has switched to it, and thus the invalid blocks 2X miners produce will simply be rejected by the network.
0-1 MB wasn't fine, but that was before anyone did any serious research on the risks of larger blocks. Despite that, we just forked to 2-4 MB on Bitcoin a few weeks ago. (2X wants to push it to 4-8 MB.)

12% support it in its current form (as an altcoin). 25% more would consent if it had consensus.
63% are opposed.


I don't think this can be expressed as a percentage. 1%, who are all miners, for example, could not block a hardfork; but 1% who are a mix of merchants selling desirable goods and users who wish to buy those goods, could.


That's the long-term greedy. Miners have clearly been focusing on short-term greedy, and also acquiring *power* for long-term. Regardless of incentives, miners have not been acting in the interests of the community, nor as representatives thereof.

No, "just trust the miners" is *not* how Bitcoin is supposed to work.


No... it doesn't currently support larger than 4 MB (the current block size limit), but that's because it's a Bitcoin protocol rule; and much more than the p2p network can handle sanely already.


Maybe when/if there is, we can discuss bigger blocks at that time. But you're missing the main point: that Bitcoin relies on FIBRE is *a bad thing*.


Good luck. Nobody has so far. Handwaving "we can figure things out later" is no excuse to cripple the network today.

No, because a single person cannot form an economy on his own. At the very least, you'd need two people, and they'd have to be people in positions such that they can form an economy. Realistically, though, there'd probably need to be at least a few dozen, and even that seems liable to be marginalized out of existence.
In the case of 2X, however, *most* of the Bitcoin economy is opposed, and intends to continue using Bitcoin as-is, even after 2X launches.

2X's attack on the Bitcoin network is designed to intentionally try to exploit the vulnerabilities. We'll see how well it holds up, and how many people get screwed over by it.
The root of the problem is that many people are using light wallets, unaware that they are completely insecure. If too many people are insecure, the entire network loses its security as well.




Satoshi left before fatal flaws were found in SPV. The original design cannot work, and we have no known alternatives besides everyone running full nodes.


As Bitcoin is today, this is simply *necessary* for it to function securely. No matter how much people dislike it, that is a fact.


Goals are one thing, but unless there's a real-world way to make those goals reality, they don't matter. Thankfully, full nodes can be invisible, so things remain simple for the users.


There's no comparison. Email isn't decentralised, merely federated. Seeding is more like sharing the blocks, than simply running a full node. And none of these involve consensus systems, which is literally what Bitcoin's blockchain does.

They knew the risks when they got in the business, *and they chose not to prepare for it* (or maybe they did?). The plan from the moment the first ASIC was announced, was to change PoW algorithm if it resulted in miner centralisation. Everything beyond that point is *borrowed time*. Manufacturers were also recommended to build an alternative algorithm/variant in their chips in case a PoW change was needed. If they did that, then their chips could be supported by the new PoW rule. Furthermore, if they wanted to, they could intentionally put a stop to the centralisation. So the manufacturers have nobody to blame but themselves (and their customers should blame them).

Why don't you just download the forking block in its entirety, and check the size? Start with the most-work chain, download its block 494784, and see if it's oversized. If so, flag the chain as 2X, and move on to the next-best chain.

But to answer the question:
There are 52596 blocks per year, so:
* Previous years, the maximum blockchain growth and maintenance-bandwidth was 53 GB/year.
* Now, the maximum blockchain growth and maintenance-bandwidth is 210 GB/year. Realistically, 105-158 GB should be expected.
* On 2X, the maximum blockchain growth and maintenance-bandwidth will be 420 GB/year. Realistically, 210-316 GB should be expected.

Anyone can mine. The miners we have now are probably among the worst possible (not all of them, obviously, mainly just Bitmain).


Bitcoin's benefits are so much better than traditional money that it doesn't need marketing. Marketing has in fact caused Bitcoin to grow too fast for it to realistically handle. So sorry to say, and no offence intended to them (they do an excellent job), but marketers are probably detrimental.


Bitcoin can't function without users. This category probably needs to be clarified between actual Bitcoin users and bitcoin (the currency) traders/holders.

So find more funding for development. While perhaps the three devs now funded by MIT might be willing to consider changing funding source (although, if MIT is just funding them, there may be no advantage here!), it would probably be more beneficial to Bitcoin to instead pay people who don't already have funding to work on Bitcoin Core. More devs = better. :)

This seems like trolling. Who said women can't be police, judge, prosecutor, etc?

Neither client will follow the longest chain, because "longest chain" is not what is Bitcoin. Never has been, never will be. Validity comes first, and btc1\2X is not valid. Miners don't change this.
And businesses generally *do not* support it. Only a minority, mostly owned by a single group, do.
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:10:14
Until you see it on your own full node, you have no way to be sure it has confirmed.
But no, you cannot stop it from getting mined. If you didn't tell someone to send them, however, you have no liability for doing anything in response to that.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:28:00
Generally, yes. To be secure, you'd need a backup off the phone, a way to remotely lock out the phone, and configure it all to trust only your own full node.

Expecting at least most people to run their own full node, is the only way Bitcoin can work.

@_date: 2015-04-04 23:32:23
If the sequence for all inputs is ffffffff, it can't be incremented any more. The original design had it so higher sequence numbers were in policy preferred over lower ones regardless of other attributes - so a transaction with the maximum sequence number would eventually be confirmed regardless of its lock time (because it wasn't policy-appropriate to mine anything else, even with am earlier lock time). Therefore, there was no reason to delay mining the transaction until its lock time.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:52:34
No, BIP148 would not have caused a split under any circumstances. Miners may have intentionally split the chain to retaliate, but that's on them (and they could do it any time, with or without BIP148).
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:34:27
Light wallets are harming Bitcoin too much to recommend ever using them at this point. (Unless you use them with a trusted node of your own.)

Executing code in the Bitcoin consensus process could be an easy way to introduce exploits. Messing with peer selection based on UA is a terrible idea: not only does it encourage lying about UAs, it also can result in accidental partitioning, leading to a chain split. There's not very many useful things a plugin framework could do.

Get your own Bitcoin node and wallet, and transfer your bitcoins to them ASAP.
For a node, the most popular choices are basically Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots. They both come with built-in wallets, which you can use or not.
If you wish to use Bread for your wallet, follow their instructions to tether it to your node.

They're the ones changing it. Bitcoin has never been rule-by-miners.
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:57:52
How few people can be effectively excluded from the community is unclear, but clearly significant community opposition can prevent a hardfork.
Mining can in theory act as a proxy for community support, when mining is well-distributed among the community, or miners intentionally act based on community will. Neither have been the case for Bitcoin in years.
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:51:16
How does sending it interfere with this? Just click Send, then copy the raw transaction from the Transactions tab...
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:28:42
Everyone transacting in bitcoins should run a full node. Whether you run Core, Knots, btcd, or some other implementation, is up to you.
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:10:35
That doesn't make sense, since transactions can only be mined once. You want multiple transactions, I guess?
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:19:56
No, PoW change is already more than justified, ever since mining got centralised. It's just stupid that the community has let them get away with it for so long, even after miners began actively attacking the network.
There is nothing nuclear about a PoW change. It is a simple upgrade to fix a long-standing flaw that was introduced.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:55:29
IIRC, MultiBit once used post-pay. It set aside funds as you transacted, and then sent the fee separately after it accrued some value from multiple transactions. Lightning is definitely a better way to handle this, though.

Blocks taking hours is no problem. Miners can be replaced, if they defect to an altcoin.

Pretty sure it just adds the new port. If it does cut off 8333, you can use `-bind` to restore it.
Note that 462378 is not a valid port number (range is 1-65535; typically 1-1024 are reserved). Also note 0.0.0.0 will block off IPv6 for that port.

Minimum internet usage is ~14 GB/mo with `blocksonly` mode (no instant/unconfirmed transactions, mind you). If you need/want it lower, you can set up a dedicated satellite dish. Initial setup requires downloading ~150 GB.
Storage requirement is ~8 GB with pruning enabled.
Computing power is relative to bandwidth usage, including the initial setup of ~150 GB of data to process. On a modern desktop PC, it can take a day or two for the initial setup.

With 85% enforcing the rules, any invalid blocks will quickly be resolved as rejected. Much less, and it becomes less and less clear (and eventually even *probable* that the invalid block prevails) what the outcome will be.


Depends on block complexity (which is more than just size) and CPU.


Probably. Keep in mind this is *per node/hop*. Since Bitcoin is [supposed to be] a decentralised p2p network, it will take several hops for blocks to cross it.


No. Miners are padding blocks with spam.


Only if the network reliably rejects it. And in ordinary circumstances the risk of mining on top of an invalid block is very low, compared to the certainty of lost income due to block propagation.
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:26:58




Yes, you do anyway.

Pool mining is indeed another centralisation risk - however, decentralised mining protocols (such as [GBT]( and p2pool) solve that. Smart property ASICs could theoretically solve it for cloud mining, but nobody seems to be working on this.

@_date: 2015-04-25 11:32:12

So we need better education to teach users they shouldn't be influenced by miners.


Fracturing development isn't particularly useful. "Core" isn't a centralised group, but rather an open source project lots of independent people and groups collaborate on. I agree it would be better if there were many different release flavours (we already have Knots, Satoshi RBF, and Bitcoin addrindex), but I'm not sure we have the combined development resources to support much more at this time. We developers are too few and overworked as it is already. Get more people involved in Bitcoin development, and perhaps this situation will change.

Hardware wallets are useful because they narrow the exposure to vulnerabilities. While a typical Windows PC is likely exposed to a cracker, a hardware wallet powered off and locked in a safe is not. Your node is only needed for security at the time of verifying receipt of bitcoins, but securing your keys is necessary at all times to maintain control of them.
Unfortunately, there is no plug-and-play way to use *both* a hardware wallet *and* a full node, today.

Why do you expect a 5 year old to understand complex technical topics like "how" these things work? I doubt a 5 year old can understand this, but it's the best I can do:
Think of sidechains as basically like a bitcoin bank, but operated by a blockchain instead of company. The sidechain can do anything it wants with the bitcoins it receives, but like any other bitcoin user, it can only "send back" what it has received. It makes sense for them to peg their sidechain tokens to bitcoin, but they don't *need* to.
Sidechains don't need to be proof-of-work, but there is no such thing as functional proof-of-stake, and proof-of-burn makes no sense in this context. The common alternative to proof-of-work would be a multisig/centralised blockchain where corporate entities sign off on each block.

Low priority. Many other more important improvements to do first. And likely when the block size is increased again, it won't be a dumb 2x...
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:08:34
Yes, but then you have the problem of double-*sending* (not *spending*) attacks.
For example, you send me 1 BTC, but before it confirms, Mr. Attacker sees it and sends me 1 satoshi at the same address, with a higher fee. Miners logically prefer the latter, and confirm that. Now your legit send is conflicted and I never get the 1 BTC.

Make sure you're also using that full node for your wallet(s)!
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:13:00
Yes, the disk formats are compatible. Only exception would be if you made your wallet a rather-old version of Knots, which had a wallet feature that Core never merged, but that was pre-HD, and I've avoided adding such features since.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:19:24
It does *technically* validate others' transactions, but so does every other node. Doing that isn't useful unless someone is actually using the node, however. The only reason it checks others' transactions, is because your own transactions' validity depends on every other transaction in the block and previous blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:22:03
@_date: 2015-04-25 15:55:57
Well, before we get to that point, we need some way to maintain a full copy distributed across all nodes. I imagine many people will want to maintain archive nodes with everything as well, just in case.

UASF only needed sufficient economic support, at most a simple majority. A hardfork has a much higher bar: we need to convince the entire community to upgrade. It may be possible, but don't get your expectations that I have some kind of magic consensus-building power. :)
Probably one of the hardest groups to convince would be the Trilema/ Popescu group that runs their own fork of Core 0.5. Anyone know how to convince them to go along with a hardfork? Is there any hardfork-required feature they'd be interested in gaining? :/
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:36:27
The best possible action to take, is if the community collectively all ignores 2X. Then it will never get any value, and the losses will be zero.
That's not likely to happen.
For now, the safest plan of action for a single individual is to move the coins to a wallet you control completely (ideally a hardware wallet), and do not spend them after 2X launches, until someone makes a splitter.
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:53:32
A simple digital signature could do that.
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:44:10

No such thing as sending from an address at all. Electrum is broken for giving users the impression there is.

Provable fairness and the blockchain are two unrelated things, and neither require the other: you can get stronger provable fairness *without* a blockchain. Abusing the blockchain for something it was not intended for is neither good for either Bitcoin nor the service (to do it securely necessarily involves long delays). The only "gambling sites" using the blockchain "for" provable fairness, are really just attacks on Bitcoin using gambling as a front to fund the attack.

For a shift to happen, either Bitmain needs to liquidate their existing miners, or total network hashrate needs to increase to reduce their percentage. But if total network hashrate increases, difficulty will also increase, and so will income from mining. The current difficulty *already* makes mining a loss for most people, so any further difficulty increases will make it an even greater loss. In the end, this means a growing majority of people won't be entering mining, and Bitmain gets to maintain their monopoly control over the network.
@_date: 2015-09-28 07:01:58
Addresses are single-use tokens that *receive* bitcoin payments into a wallet. They don't hold bitcoins, don't have balances, don't send bitcoins, and shouldn't be used more than once. There do exist technical ways to link addresses going to the same wallet.

If you receive a payment of 5 BTC, you now have a *new* 5 BTC coin. You didn't get someone else's 5 BTC coin - they burned 5 BTC worth of bitcoins for the right to mint yours anew. So, there is no "history" to learn about.
Consider a common case:
* Alice mines 25 BTC.
* Bob mines 25 BTC.
* Alice pays Bob 5 BTC, destroying her mined 25 BTC.
* Bob pays you 5 BTC, destroying both the 5 BTC from Alice, and the 25 BTC he mined (destroying both is necessary to cover a transaction fee).
In this scenario, there is no way to decide whether the 5 BTC you received ought to be "linked" with Bob's mined bitcoins or Alice's. Any such attempts to "link" coins like this is speculative, and of no bearing to the actual system, which only sees your 5 BTC as an entirely new coin.

The only real convenience of a SPV wallet is because of the IBD time and resource usage, both of which are tied to the block[chain] size. And yes, the network *does* benefit from them running a node. If the economic majority are running "SPV", then they have effectively *removed all the rules in Bitcoin*. Think about that.

It doesn't affect any nodes. If you were the *only person* using Tor (and didn't also use clearnet), it would affect you. If *none of the Tor users* had clearnet links, it would affect all of them. But as long as at least one honest Tor user is also a clearnet user, every combination is secure.

Reducing block sizes does not require consensus, just any one or more of:
1. More support than opposition (for a softfork).
2. Miner(s) to change a configuration setting (can be done on a miner-by-miner basis).
3. User(s) to pay higher fees only to miners who produce smaller blocks (can be done on a user-by-user basis).

Bitcoin identifies payments by using a unique address for each transaction.

Addresses and public keys, while related, are pretty much entirely different things. Hashing gives an additional layer of security (nobody has the actual key to try to break until it's almost too late), and makes the Base58 encoded data shorter (so the resulting address can be smaller). Additionally, newer addresses are not actually hashes of the public key, but of a complete script - this also allows them to be more flexible than merely a simple ECDSA check.

"Bare multisig" refers to putting the multisig script directly in the output pubkey - so all nodes must store the entire script until it is spent. This also means the sender needs to know the full multisig script, and must pay a fee sufficient to cover its (large) size.
P2SH, on the other hand, puts that same script in the redemption, so nodes only need to download and process it when it is being spent (and never need to store it at all). Since only the script's hash is in the transaction, the sender can use a simple address (which encodes the hash) and pays a normal fee.

No perfect ideas, AFAIK, but some possible ways to improve it:
* Hardfork to break old ASICs whenever manufacturers self-mine.
* Make decentralised pool mining easier (GBT or some new successor protocol).
* Smart property ASICs could be bought and sold on the blockchain without the overhead of physically moving hardware.
* Setup retailers who do sales/customer support for ASICs so the manufacturers don't bias toward big industrial miners.
Most of these kinds of ideas reduce manufacturer profit, however, so unless we as a community are willing to hardfork out greedy manufacturers, it doesn't seem like Bitcoin will survive as a decentralised system. :(

Some combination of proof-of-reserves with proof-of-work (that is, publishing near misses of blocks being mined) would seem to be the proof claimed.
Note having this proof doesn't change the core problems with "cloud mining", however. If they want to fix that, they will need to research and develop smart property miners so the "share" owners actually do the mining themselves remotely using the hardware (in a trusted way). $100k is probably nowhere near the funds needed to pull this off, though (unfortunately).

It is unclear if private keys themselves even have owners. They are just numbers, after all. What would make more sense is a proof you own some number of bitcoins; or proof you sent a particular transaction. However, the shortcomings of proof-of-receiving-with-address aren't obvious to solve, so I'm not sure it's worth the effort to make those other signature types until this first use case is fixed.

Orphaned blocks are ones without a known previous-block. Until 0.10, this would happen when a peer sent you a block 1001 before you had block 1000. In 0.10, headers-first changed this so you would never request block 1001 until after you knew about block 1000 (although I guess blocks are still downloaded out-of-order, so you might not know *much* about block 1000 - and maybe that could still be considered an orphan block case).

It's far more likely for two unrelated persons with properly secure bitcoin wallets (ie, good random) to generate the same bitcoin addresses as each other, than for a block to not have a solution. The destruction of the solar system in a short timeframe is also more likely than both of these.

Go to shared wallet UI (eg, coinbase.com), enter your message, click the button, and the remote wallet generates a signature for you.


Well, the obvious way to do this would be to add some kind of "proof of funds" signature to Bitcoin (write a BIP, implement it in Core, etc). But that's probably not addressing your real concern (that perhaps trolls own bitcoins, and non-trolls might not?).
@_date: 2015-04-15 11:09:35
It's pretty much only by coincidence that DP-style spam can be matched by script. As you note, if they used bitcoin correctly (single use of each address) it would be near impossible to identify and filter. Until recently, I'd just have to say I don't have a solution - but the Lightning network concept changes that. Once it is implemented, real transactions will be off-chain and only "settled" on the blockchain occasionally. This changes the fee structure: now people who legitimately want to use Bitcoin can "afford" higher fees for the occasional blockchain use, while spammers are left trying to compete with those fees for *every single spam-tx*. I don't think gambler irrationality is sufficient to overcome this disadvantage, thus restoring (at least to a usable extent) the viability of fee-based spam protection.

1. I can't even get 10 Mbps today. I doubt that will magically turn into 10 Gbps tomorrow. (the article is talking about cellular/5G technologies, but 4G is not widely available, and even 2G/3G are still spotty)
2. Increasing block size early discourages attempts to improve scalability until it may be too late (hitting a hard limit). Until blocks are consistently full, we do not even realistically know *what* the real scalability challenges will be.
3. Until blocks are consistently full, we do not have a transaction fee market.
That being said, I'm not decidedly opposed to lifting the hard limit - we could still do that and trust miners not to make bigger blocks outside of an emergency or future decision. On the other hand, mining is becoming dangerously centralised, and this makes it even more dangerous.

No, you are completely wrong on every point here. BIP66 had no problems at all; the invalid blockchain forks were *entirely* the fault of miners who skipped the verification and ignored the failed validation result even when it completed.

No, there was one hardfork in Bitcoin's history, and it was done by setting a fixed future date for the change.

No, this is theoretically impossible. One can always just take a GPU, strip out the parts we don't use, and suddenly have a more efficient ASIC. And even if we could use *all* the parts of the GPU, that is no different than saying "AMD owns the Bitcoin network".
Botnets have never had problems with GPU mining, and the average person (ie, not gamers) probably has a crappy GPU anyway. ASICs are the ideal - we just need to ensure they are widely available (and only purchased by people with an interest in mining - otherwise botnets again).


Just as theoretically impossible as GPU-only.


Do you really want Bitcoin to be managed by criminals?


Nope. Botnet miners have near zero costs, which means anyone who has to pay for power is out of the competition, and it's dominated exclusively by botnets. :(


We're pretty much already there now. The situation hasn't improved (yet?).

First of all, ignore blockchain.info: it's unreliable and full of misinformation.
Bitcoin wallets are much more complicated that merely a bunch of addresses. There is no real user-friendly way to verify they are empty without syncing the client to the network and looking at the balance - and even then you miss future transactions. Just save it. Or publish it somewhere for all to download and fight over (be sure there's no sensitive metadata like labels!).

Of ECDSA private keys, I can't think of any valid use case. Of wallet private keys (aka seeds), it seems okay - although it misses out on metadata which may be of varying importance.

Confirmation is basically when the recipient has determined the transaction is sufficiently trustworthy. In this case, they are waiting until it is 10 blocks deep in the blockchain. Completely unnecessary for a streaming service IMO since they can simply cut you off the moment you double spend them, with relatively no loss to themselves.
For comparison purposes, note that credit cards take 6+ months to confirm.

It's no better than 5 MB blocks. Block interval isn't that relevant - you need about an hour worth of blocks on average for a good confirmation regardless of how many blocks make that up. At the same time, a shorter block interval increases the cost of light nodes and harms the network's security due to more block collisions.

You don't *have* to try to use the absolute minimum fee accepted. You could just pay 0.01 BTC/kB consistently and most likely every transaction would get confirmed rather quickly. On the other hand, if you're okay waiting, you could just pay some baseline fee and wait until a day the network is less busy. Both of these goals (fast confirmation and patient confirmation) can be achieved with fairly non-volatile fee rates.

Not necessarily, but possibly. Note this only helps you during IBD, *not* participating in the live network (where 10 minutes is far too long for downloading *and uploading to your peers*).

It would be nice if there were people who could volunteer to discuss such topics, get a good understanding of them, and write/improve the articles.

We had 100% agreement on the last block size limit hardfork in 2013, so I see no reason to think it won't be possible again, *when it makes sense to do it*.

@_date: 2015-09-17 03:59:09
"Fill or kill" is *intentionally* not supported, since it breaks a core assumption of Bitcoin usage: that a transaction will never be reversed unless it is double-spent. In particular, such a rule would allow a big pool to cancel unrelated transactions even when the sender is innocent of fraud.

OP_RETURN just terminates the script immediately with failure. Scripts can contain data pushes, but that data is never supposed to be intended/coloured as anything but 1) a cryptographic key/signature, 2) a hash, or 3) executable/structured code.

Eligius's FAQ has an item ["I represent law enforcement, and we are investigating a crime"]( which specifically makes it possible for law enforcement to get information about miners. If illegal activity via Tor becomes common, the pool may also be forced to shut down tor access, which would be a shame - besides, LE can trace through Tor if they want to anyway.

Undefined. Bitcoin Core today will reconsider them for inclusion to its own memory pool, but subject to at least some of the same rules as if it received them broadcast on the network - so it might choose to discard them depending on local node policy (which *should* be configured by the end node operator).


They're no different than any other unconfirmed transaction at that point, except for:
* The reorganising nodes add them to their memory pools before considering anything else on the network that may have been conflicting (only relevant with some policies).
* If the new blockchain already has a conflicting transaction, they must be discarded.
Note that miners are all different and *should* have different policies for inclusion of transactions. Just because miner X decided to prefer one transaction over a conflicting spend, does *not* mean miner Y will decide the same way.

There's a difference between using data and storing data. A block chain uses well-formed data to establish consensus of the UTXO database between nodes. The UTXO database stores only *scripts (executable data)*. Nodes generally also store the block chain as data. However, there is no way to *use Bitcoin's block chain* to store data. Namecoin, on the other hand, establishes consensus of a key/value database in addition to the UTXO database, and can store data.

The imported key will be used to determine your wallet's balance.

The private key is used to create the signature, but it is best practices for shared wallets (where users should not have access to the private keys) to produce such signatures on demand for the recipient of an address.
Verification uses the message+signature to calculate the public key, hashes that, and compares it to the address the user provided. In theory, you could forego providing the address for comparison to be told what address produced the signature, but that has security implications (humans like to compare only the start/end so near-collisions could be made).

There is no central authority, in the same sense that TLS and PGP have no central authority. But just as TLS and PGP rely (to some extent) on trusting others to know if the key is correct, Bitcoin has *no means whatsoever* to ensure the key is correct. The blockchain does not provide any solution to the shortcomings that TLS solves with centralised trust, it simply ignores the problem altogether, leaving it for the user to deal with in some unspecified manner. Generally the only way to solve it for Bitcoin, is to make sure you get the right address/payment URI from a TLS-authenticated website or PGP signed message.

The simplest way would be to send ALL your bitcoins to yourself, but with a small amount to the given address. Then your change would be split.
Besides bloating the blockchain, this would also severely harm your wallet's privacy (and by extension, the privacy of the entire network) unless you do it as part of a coinjoin with many others.
Recovering the split 2Xcoins is another matter for later.

Bitcoin signed messages prove nothing beyond that they receive payments to the address. It doesn't prove they control the private key, still have funds previously sent to that address, or sent a transaction consuming the UTXO created when bitcoins were sent to that address.

The proposal in the gist is overly dependent on every node running a centralised policy, and penalises miners and nodes who deviate from it. Centralisation of policy is already a problem for Bitcoin, so making it worse is not really a good idea. There may be better variations of this that are policy-independent, though (this is, they can function equally-biased with any policy the *user* chooses, rather than the centralised bias).
@_date: 2015-04-20 03:40:11
*IF* PoS is not inherently centralised, nobody has figured out how to make it decentralised yet.
Decentralised proof-of-any-work may be possible with zk-SNARKs, but Gridcoin does not do that.

No, an attacker can use its modified rules to cause different behaviour than you can get from a proper Bitcoin node, even if the current miners never change version flags.

Mere demand is not relevant until code is written. For practical purposes, strong anonymity basically needs at least sidechains (for testing). That's in progress.
Once that's done, the next step would be talking about how to get strong anonymity. All the existing concepts have serious problems (IIRC, none of them support pruning).
But who is going to do this research? It's over my head, at least. I'm not sure how strongly other devs care about anonymity (I don't really) - Bitcoin's current level of theoretical privacy is "good enough" for many people. If the demand is so huge, those demanding should think about funding the research and development needed. Developers work on things that either interest them personally, or they are paid to work on... As far as I know, strong anonymity is not presently either of those for anyone working on Bitcoin today.

Segwit is not a hardfork.
A softfork is additional rules added to the protocol. A hardfork is an altcoin that everyone switches to (typically inheriting funds held on the current system).
@_date: 2015-09-11 05:42:25
That implies the implementation can change... which it realistically cannot\* in any significant way.
\* without the consent of others, not merely the developers making the change; and when this happens, *all* nodes *must* necessarily copy the same change.
Don't confuse the Bitcoin implementation with the wallet or node software. Everyone wants more competition in those.
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:44:10
If it was simply a fork (like my "ljr" variant), that'd be Bitcoin still, but altcoins which don't implement the same protocol are explicitly off-topic (at least until there is agreement to migrate to them as "the new Bitcoin" and everyone abandons the old Bitcoin).

@_date: 2016-10-04 00:25:10
No, because the drivechain rules are explicitly miner voting.
Furthermore, if even merely the miners enforced the voting to match the sidechain consensus rules, you would de facto be transforming the sidechain into merely a part of the main chain, as full nodes would *need* to sync the entire sidechain for such enforcement.

It's cleaner, safer, and simpler code as a softfork. Hardforks necessarily require complete consensus and universal awareness (from Bitcoin users), while softforks can be done with merely widespread support.

Developers don't get to decide things for Bitcoin. There is no consensus for a hardfork, so it cannot happen. It's way too late in 2016 to have any reasonable hope for achieving consensus, so a HF in 2016 is out of the question.
There's also literally no benefit whatsoever to doing a 2MB SegWit HF when we have a well-tested and far safer 2MB SegWit SF ready to go, which can be deployed with merely widespread agreement.

It might make sense to separate the initial distribution of bitcoins from mining at the same time, if we ever get a workable PoS scheme. Mining isn't getting free bitcoins, it's deciding transaction order and deploying softforks.

I'm suggesting that considering they are *already* abusing their position, entrusting them with more power may be unwise. Especially power that enables them to make it more difficult for others to compete, as the block size does.
Also note that *not only miners* should be able to run a node. If only miners can run nodes, they are even further empowered: now they can fabricate bitcoins and effectively make bitcoin a centralised service.


While hotel rooms sold cannot be later filled (they are sold), the same is not true of mining. Miners can drop less-profitable transactions for more-profitable ones at any time, so there is no exclusivity issue to deter accepting the lower fees. Bitcoin is also intentionally designed such that the cost of accepting transactions is as close to zero as practical.

Reasonable estimate on how much economic activity would need to insist on rejecting an invalid blockchain, in the event of miners violating the consensus rules.


My DNS seed's crawler sees nearly 8k *listening* full nodes, and there are no doubt many more that are not listening. Admittedly, however, the situation today is still probably quite dire.


8 peers is based on the 8 outgoing connections every node makes, and reasonably needed to ensure propagation only takes a few hopes. It might be possible to reduce it to 6 or 4, if we also reduce the number of seconds to relay significantly (more than offsetting the peers relayed to), but I'm not sure if there may be other factors involved in doing so, since de facto each node *will* have 8 peers, and will try to relay to all of them.


Sorry, I meant bitcoin users in that context, not Bitcoin users. ;)


Well, we need to solve this somehow if we want Bitcoin to succeed (without turning into PayPal).

[**Part 1 here**](


Mining hasn't been a profitable enterprise for most people for several years now. I see no reason to bail out the big centralising miners when it's really the small miners we need. In any case, this is a non-issue. Increasing the block size won't increase users or transaction fees (on the contrary, it will reduce them). If miners need higher fees, they can simply set their minimum fee higher and refuse to include transactions that don't meet it.


It's true that increasing the block size misses the point and fails to solve scaling. But that isn't the purpose of segregated witness. SegWit's primary goal is to fix an issue in Bitcoin preventing the more advanced smart contracts that it was originally designed to support. Fixing this issue also happens to enable real scaling solutions for Bitcoin like Lightning.


Hardforks require all users to upgrade, no exceptions possible. If you're saying it will take all users a year to upgrade, then it is absolutely impossible for any hardfork to take effect (ie, to provide *any* increase to the block size limit) any earlier than that. SegWit's softfork, on the other hand, gives immediate gradual increases to the limit as soon as people upgrade, enabling not only a partial upgrade, but also making it safe for the full benefit to be reached even sooner.


This is simply false. While there is a minor change to the structure of transactions, it is trivial to update software for it. And more importantly, these changes are absolutely *necessary* for real scaling solutions, regardless of whether it is deployed as a softfork or a hardfork. Additionally, most software just uses a few common wallet libraries for this logic, so they won't need any changes at all. Besides, this work is already done: almost everything that needs to be changed for segwit is already updated and ready to go.


SegWit *is* an actual block size limit increase.


It is both. But more importantly, Lightning is a decentralised protocol, and does not change the control-model of Bitcoin.


Lightning makes Bitcoin fast, efficient *without* making it less resilent or safe.


Clearly you don't understand Lightning at all. They literally are full-fleged Bitcoin transactions.


This is nothing but unsubstantiated FUD.


No, that's not how Lightning works.


To be clear, expecting a blockchain alone to scale to support millions of users transacting small amounts of bitcoin is what is truly absurd.


Only because of incompetent people arguing increasing it is safe (or even sane) long before it actually is.


The "free market" has already decided, and continues to decide. It is why the block size limit remains 1 MB today. Don't confuse a small group of political trolls and centralised miners with the free market, which extends to all Bitcoin users.


Far from it, it "guarantees" it will follow what the more centralised of those miners can handle for profit, which is always going to be far more than what the Bitcoin network is actually capable of handling safely, and will cut off smaller miners who cannot keep up.


BTW, last time I checked, the "maximum size they are willing to accept" code was entirely broken. Let me know when they have unit tests that ensure 1 PB blocks are actually accepted correctly... (hint: this is larger than the 2^48 physical memory limit of even high-end modern CPUs)


Many Bitcoin users today consider the current block size limit to be a fundamental quality that must be preserved, seeing as it is so essential to decentralisation and their even being able to use Bitcoin. Yet even more consider the immutability of Bitcoin's rules without consensus to be a fundamental quality, and would object on those grounds.


No, if attempted without consensus, a split is pretty much a certainty.

tl;dr: OP doesn't understand segwit and listens to FUD too much. He should hire a technically-competent person to follow Bitcoin developments for him.


It doesn't require any changes at all... In any case, sidechains are pretty much completely unrelated to segwit.


[BIP 69](


Such as?


This is pure FUD. We are all overworked and would love to see the developer team grow, including alternative implementations.


You should learn the difference between softforks and hardforks sometime. All softforks degrade the security of formerly-full nodes. The difference is that hardforks leave those nodes *completely* insecure and broken.


You always have a choice. There's no such thing as "anyonecanspend tx", BTW - that's an abstraction used to explain things to the non-technically literate.


It's not being forced. If people don't think it's ready, then they won't activate it. But it is, however, probably the most well-tested change in the history of Bitcoin, and the simplest possible way to increase the block size and solve most malleability problems.


I'm glad we don't have any such control, although your ad hominems are not appreciated.


No such thing exists. When it comes to automating things, we have only DMMS/PoW/miner consensus, and that only works for transaction ordering and softforks. Segwit is being deployed as a softfork, so basically exactly as you're saying it's supposed to be.


Great, but instead of stagnating Bitcoin, it'd be nice if you made well-informed decisions rather than just rejecting everything off-hand.


Lightning doesn't require trust any more than the current Bitcoin transactions do.


This is just more FUD. No conflicts of interest exist, nor is anything being held down for business interests. Your post here is actually holding block size down more than we are.


Staying within this growth allows for a max average block size of only 1.68 MB. (But Neilsen's law actually predicts only a 50% increase in speed per year, so if it holds true we really need to be limiting to 850k on average to stay within its bounds!)
`88 GB blockchain growth per year ÷ 365 days per year ÷ 144 blocks per day × 1000 MB per GB = ~1.67 MB per block`
You need to check your math.
Additionally, this is all assuming the current block size is safe, which it clearly is not.


Lightning *is* Bitcoin.

Because it means you're enforcing the protocol rules economically. If someone pays you and it "confirms" with invalid blocks, your node will just ignore them, but Electrum will tell you it's confirmed. If 90% of bitcoin economy believes a transaction has confirmed that hasn't like this, you effectively lose *all* the rules of the system, and inflation becomes possible.

IMO Bitcoin makes taxes an absolute necessity. But it increases accountability, because people will see just how much the State's services are costing them (as opposed to the hidden cost of inflation).
Ideally, collection would be done by the State sending me a regular invoice for taxes I owe, as a Bitcoin payment request. They would calculate what I owe based on a watch-only HD wallet seed I share with them. (People who don't want the government to watch their wallet could calculate their own taxes, just like they already do.)

Just pick a client from [this webpage]( that shows "Full validation" in the details (click the icons).
For this to actually contribute to the network in a meaningful way, you need to use it when receiving payments from people. This can be done either: 1) with the built-in wallet, or 2) by instructing your light client(s) to exclusively use the node you run (the only secure way to do so right now is to setup Tor).

Pretty sure Pieter's position hasn't changed. He/we are providing the code for segwit, but that code won't activate or do anything so long as it's controversial. I don't see how you can call that "pushing" it.
Edit: Note also that even if segwit activates, nobody is forced to use it. Even miners can refuse to enforce it and their blocks will still be accepted so long as they don't try to mine invalid segwit transactions (which no existing miners will anyway) or build on such invalid blocks. So if 95% activate segwit, the remaining 5% literally *can* do nothing and remain mining valid non-segwit blocks.

@_date: 2016-10-30 02:52:35
The HD wallet in Core should be reasonably safe - it just uses the HD derivation when calculating ECDSA private keys, and stores them as it would a randomly generated key. So as long as you treat it the same as a non-HD wallet (ie, regular backups), it's pretty much identical in behaviour.
@_date: 2016-10-01 01:15:31
It *should* be, since all changes to the Bitcoin protocol should be agreed on by the entire community. However, there is no way to guarantee a softfork can't be abused, or even necessarily invalidate such a transaction, and there has recently been hardfork efforts by incompetent people to promote breaking compatibility, so I would advise against relying on it at this time.
@_date: 2016-10-31 12:37:23
* Full node count and percentage are at an all-time low. If you ask people why they don't run a node, the reason is often tied to the block size.
* Miners are de facto cheating by skipping the very validation that is a crucial part of their job. This breaks the little security light clients had. The cause for this is the time it takes to verify large blocks.
* Mining requires membership in a centralised backbone in order to not take huge losses due to stale rate as large blocks take time to cross the p2p network. Centralised backbones like this are inherently not permissionless, and can be censored.
* Even with the centralised backbone, colluding major pools are de facto performing 51% attacks on the rest of the miners, as an accidental result of the above conditions caused by too-large blocks.
@_date: 2016-10-30 14:12:13
While I don't think low value transactions are worthwhile in the long run, the real problem is the spam which is not intended to convey a value at all.
Reducing the block size does not involve *any* fork. Reducing the *limit* would be a softfork, but that's not something I suggested at all here.

After the PoW change activates, the miners of today will no longer be miners. It's the new miners who would then be important. Hopefully those new miners will be part of the regular community, and represented in that capacity already.

"On-chain" isn't a goal to strive for in itself. Lightning transactions, contrary to common misconception, are always *valid blockchain transactions that could be mined on-chain at any time*. The difference is they are using Bitcoin's built-in scripting language to provide a guarantee against double-spending so that you generally *don't need* to put them on-chain unless someone tries to defraud you (in which case, you keep your bitcoins and they fail). In a sense, it is actually a kind of compression - but a lossy one that improves your privacy by discarding information that is no longer relevant.
@_date: 2016-10-03 02:38:28
1. Addresses are not public information, and "public addresses" is technically not a term.
2. Addresses are opaque pointers to a wallet, not a representation of anything.
3. Most modern wallets have a single private key used to redeem funds held by any given pubkeyhash. But other wallets have a separate private key per each pubkeyhash.

Empty blocks are often actually good for the network. There is always a non-zero amount of time before miners calculate their next block template. During this time, they can try to mine a stale block or an empty block. A stale block compromises the most recent tip block, by throwing it into question until the next block resolves the conflict. An empty block, on the other hand, provides additional security to the transactions already mined, and makes reversing the previous block harder.

Just no. If segwit doesn't get broad enough agreement for 95%, then it shouldn't activate until it does.
@_date: 2016-10-13 09:41:51


Not really, it isn't. First the users must all make the collective decision to increase the block size *limit*, before any miner can increase their own block sizes.


While in theory, pool owners certainly must run a full node, so can the hardware operators, and pool owners have no particular insight into the network as a whole. And this isn't a matter of experience in any case. So no, pool owners don't have any particular experience for making such a decision.


Oh really? How are you seeing that now? I thought you claimed you had the support of the miners on your pool when you made this decision... now you claim they don't care?


Nakamoto consensus doesn't work that way. It merely determines which of multiple valid blockchains is active, not what defines a valid blockchain (which is where the block size limit rule lies). In short, Nakamoto consensus can be used for softforks, but not hardforks, because hardforks change the layer *above* Nakamoto consensus.


I'd like to see the specification and results of those tests.


Why? The now-well-tested segwit softfork can achieve 2 MB blocks just fine without a hardfork.


That assumes there is no need for a hard limit, which is clearly false. Where are your tests showing 1 PB blocks are safe today? Or are you proposing we make Bitcoin into a system which requires trusting the miners entirely rather than merely with transaction ordering?


There is no evidence supporting this. On the contrary, as things progress, it seems that within a year or two we will be able to grow Bitcoin substantially while at the same time reducing the block size. The only reason there would be to consider Bitcoin a failed experiment is if it ceases to be a decentralised currency, as is likely should the block size limit be simply removed entirely, or if the rules change when a politically active minority demands it.


If politics can defeat hard protocol rules in practice, I'm afraid it would indeed mean cryptocurrency as a whole is a failed experiment.


I agree, but this is unrelated. Bitcoin has likely acquired everyone who would be interested in it today as a user. To grow further, major advances are needed in 1) usability, 2) security, and 3) incentives. Bitcoin today is not ready for mainstream adoption, not because of scaling problems, but because it is simply too hard to use and too easy to lose. Additionally, most people simply don't have any reason to care. We can probably just sit by while fiat currencies fail, and let issue 3 solve itself, but fixing 1 and 2 will require actual effort, and not just effort in Bitcoin's development: for Bitcoin to be secure, we will need computers to be secure, and for this we need to see the end of backdoors. That includes Mac OS X, Windows, as well as the newer backdoors that have been added in Intel and AMD CPUs themselves. Or we can work toward locked down dedicated Linux systems for every mainstream user, but this carries significant problems of its own - including a higher cost to adopt Bitcoin. In any case, we're not there yet, and likely won't be in the near future.


Decentralised consensus is expensive. There's no way around that reality. Centralised systems, including fiat, can be made much cheaper than is possible for Bitcoin. We simply *cannot* compete on cost.
If miners want to help bring costs down in the short term, however, they can: stop mining spam at the expense of user's legitimate transactions. I know this is getting harder to filter out, but so far I have seen very little effort from most miners and pools to even make an effort. This isn't a problem with Bitcoin, it's a problem with miners.

No. Coinbase is a third party that holds your bitcoins for you. In other words, you're trusting them to keep them safe. But unfortunately, actually securing bitcoins is beyond the capabilities of any computer security today, and Coinbase keeping them for many people makes them a prime target for someone looking to steal them. So it's pretty much just a matter of time until they have a loss (if they haven't already). This is true of *all* online bitcoin "banks", not just Coinbase. It is also true of all webwallets, even the ones that claim they don't hold your funds (if this is true, it is only on an irrelevant technicality, and they you can still lose your funds if they are compromised).
Light clients such as Electrum are a step up, but not much. You hold your funds on your own computer, but you trust random other people to tell you about them. So it's not really safe, but you're less of a target than a big bitcoin bank. Hardware wallets can eliminate classes of attacks, but not all.
To hold bitcoins securely and trustlessly, you need to actually be using Bitcoin itself. This is done by using Bitcoin Core or other full node clients for accessing your bitcoins. If your PC gets compromised, you're still at risk, though. You can mitigate that last bit of risk by using an offline PC for your wallet.

Whether as a softfork or a hardfork, witness data must always count as part of the block's size. However, BIP 141 only describes the softfork, and no hardfork is specified nor proposed at this time.
Note that there is no 1 MB block size limit with BIP 141; it is increased to 4 MB (although the new block weight limit will typically get reached first, as the block is around 2 MB).
Miners may calculate fees however they like. However, they still must respect the block size and weight limits.

Reason/logic. Ironically, empirical evidence is nearly non-existent without reason - eg, most people can't repeat the exact same airplane flight, we have to draw conclusions from multiple different airplane flights. But before anyone even builds an airplane, designs are made that the engineers can be pretty certain won't crash and burn, even without/before real-world testing.
While one can readily find evidence of Catholicism here and there, a complete proof of the entire religion from scratch is way too much for a reddit post. Usually one must go over the proof step by step, and where you start is kinda up to you (eg, with Protestants, you can start with Scripture, whereas atheists need to start with [proof a god exists in the first place](


Catholicism is the set of doctrines (religious beliefs) revealed by God Himself. Catholic bishops later wrote letters in which they expressed a minority of these doctrines. Even later, other Catholic bishops declared that a set of these letters, as well as gospels (also written by Catholic bishops) and historical writings by prophets prior to Christ, were in fact authored by God Himself. The only basis to believe Scripture has any merit, is if one has already accepted that the Church's teachings are from God.


There are many excellent books and theological studies produced by scholars showing not only that Catholicism is true, but expounding on it as one would any science.

I recommend against using or implementing BIP 47. It is poorly designed, and the author is unwilling to fix it. (If someone wants to take over and fork it to a new BIP to fix the problems, I'm happy to help review/advise.)

8 MB * 8 bits per byte * 8 peers to relay to / 30 seconds per relay hop = 17 Mbps upload
8 MB * 144 blocks per day * 31 days per month = 36 GB/month upload
Note it's not sufficient for this to be available on the high end, but must be the bandwidth of a *typical* node. For Bitcoin to be decentralised, at least ~80% of usage must be using a full node. So if we assume 90% of that need to be capable of minimal typical node bandwidth, that leaves us with 72% of Bitcoin users need to have 17 Mbps upload bandwidth and (at least) 36 GB/mo transfer dedicated to just Bitcoin.

A hardfork is a protocol replacement that successfully replaces the old Bitcoin, and therefore becomes the new Bitcoin. In this scenario, the old Bitcoin ceases to exist as a separate currency: there is no split at all. This can only happen with ~100% of the community consenting and upgrading.
If the current Bitcoin continues to exist in parallel, the new cryptocurrency is a new altcoin. This is the guaranteed outcome of an attempted hardfork with a non-trivial split in the community.

If you have the wallet.dat+database from a month ago, that will be sufficient for 90-100 transactions after that point in time. But first, I'd wait out the sync and see if your wallet recovers anyway.

All this does is set a flag on your own transactions, and you can easily disable it. It's mostly pointless to set that flag, so I don't think it should be enabled by default, but it's not really a controversial change - you can always patch it in if you want it anyway.

@_date: 2017-05-18 17:11:45
The idea is that you have two sets of rules.
The first set (customised by yourself) are rules on what blocks you will subjectively accept as a valid block immediately. If a block meets that criteria, you consider it valid. If it doesn't, you mark it as "tentatively invalid" status.
But you still watch the most-work chain, even if it's "tentatively invalid". If that chain remains the most-work chain for N blocks more than the "tentatively invalid" block, you accept that block despite it violating your own rules, and move on as if it were valid.
The second set of rules are the "real" hard-and-fast rules. If a block violates those rules, you don't even consider it tentatively valid, and you reject it completely like Bitcoin does right now. Under no circumstances will you ever accept a chain using this block, no matter how much better the work it has. (These hard-and-fast rules are *inherently necessary*, because you might not be *capable* of even parsing a sufficiently modified block.)
Disclaimer: I don't think this stuff is a sane idea for a decentralised cryptocurrency, but I'd be curious to see how it works out in an experimental altcoin.


No, their solution to all scaling problems is to just increase the resource requirements for all Bitcoin users to add direct on-chain capacity.
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:00:18
Miners have no real power over the rules. All it takes is the community to decide enough is enough and do a UASF or PoW change.
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:09:33
Obviously the big blockers. But there are plenty of motives for spamming besides this still. It's a fad to "put something on the blockchain" even when it's completely pointless.

Currency is necessarily a public thing. If it's illegal, only the black markets can use it, and it loses all value to everyone else. Thus, the price would drop significantly.
Additionally, mining is very easy to detect, so if governments wanted to shut it down, they could, leaving Bitcoin easy for anyone to attack.
@_date: 2015-11-20 17:39:39
Miners, and especially relay nodes, need someone to write the spam filtering code for them to use. Unfortunately, most miners haven't done this themselves. Furthermore, in some cases it makes sense for people to share their spam filtering code with others, as I am doing. (After all, I am not merely just a developer, but also a miner.)
Aside from that, there is no reason for developers not to have opinions. Those opinions are what drive us to write code in the first place. We aren't servants of the Bitcoin community who must do what everyone else wants. (People who wish to have influence over the direction of development can do so either by contributing code themselves, or paying developers to do so under their direction.)
Also important to note, is that without spam filtering, Bitcoin could not work at all, as spam is effectively infinite and disrupts all other use cases. It isn't really comparable to actual usage of Bitcoin, as with store-of-value, speculation, and money laundering.
P.S. Note that the spam filter is only filtering the actual spam, *not* blacklisting the people/entities responsible for the spam.

Author doesn't understand segwit, nor extension blocks, nor softforks.


What rubbish. Bitcoin Core never had any agreement (it can't; it isn't an entity). The agreement 5 devs including myself had, was with specific other people, not with the community. And finally, we did abide by that agreement (although the delivery was not to you).


No, it doesn't separate them.


No, it doesn't. Extension blocks have nothing to do with segwit.


Not really, no. While the block format hasn't changed *much*, the majority of the "block format" is in fact the *transaction* format, and that changes slightly with segwit.


No such thing exists.


You've abstracted the transaction format away here in a manner that segwit literally makes *no changes* to.
(Ignoring that UTXOs aren't addresses...)


Correction: Obsolete nodes are given a copy of the transaction *with the signature stripped out*, because that is the only way they will calculate the correct hash for the transaction id.


That's how softforks work, yes. (Although note even then - and in this case as well - these "zombies" are still far more secure than light clients.)


SegWit is exactly the same kind of change.


No, it hasn't. It won't validate it entirely (because that's true of all softforks), but it will still understand it, and a comparison of UTXO sets between old nodes and new ones will match perfectly.


Yes it will.


This is technically true of all softforks (and much worse with hardforks). The risk for softforks, including segwit, is quite minimal, however.


No, there is nothing urgent about this. It's also expected that miners should not starting making larger blocks immediately when Segwit makes it possible.


No, this is nonsense. The transaction id must simply be calculated without the witness data. There is no reason this needs to impact the format, and segwit could have been just as easily deployed without any transaction format change. The reason for changing the format is to make it simpler to implement.


Technical debt cannot be avoided, period. We must always validate block 1, 2, 3, etc. no matter how the format is changed.


No, it really isn't. It's simply just a bad idea.


The only thing inferior about it is some design decisions made to minimise additional testing. Those could be fixed, but it would take many additional months (as would any alternative to segwit). Considering the lack of needed use cases for these changes, there is no interest in bothering with them.


Conflicts between changes is a very regular occurance in development. It is expected and not any indication of a problem.

@_date: 2017-05-24 00:39:48
cc You're both wrong.
Segwit today is 4 MB actual limit with 2 MB effective limit. However, legacy (non-segwit) transactions can only fill 1 MB. 4 MB is only possible with a pure-spam block.
With this hardfork, it would allow 2 MB blocks regardless of whether they were full of Segwit or legacy transactions. It would disallow the blocks larger than 4 MB, but this shouldn't be a problem for honest miners since effective size is only 2 MB anyway. On the other hand, guaranteeing 2 MB allows planning resources for the non-spam case.
Transaction selection isn't a packing problem, because the size limit can be simply ignored without impacting honest miners.

Meh, the same FUD we've had for years. QC-safe softforks for Bitcoin are no big deal, and while there's a bit of complexity in making current ECDSA-based UTXOs safe, it can also be done with a softfork\* thanks to Segwit's script versioning (they don't need to upgrade to segwit to get this protection, however).
\* It's impossible to make ECDSA-based UTXOs safe if you're reusing addresses, however. Don't do that; it's not supported, and *will* break in this scenario.

In a true hardfork, everyone will need to upgrade their node software.
If a failed hardfork splits the chain, there is no simple way to handle it for the end user at this time. You would want to just not send or accept any bitcoins until the situation is resolved.

Yes, precisely. 25% is sufficient for approximately 52% probability of success reversing a transaction with a 1-block confirmation; and 40% is sufficient to reverse 6-block confirmation with just over 50% probability.


The guarantee is over infinite time, but the chance of failure is still quite small over short time periods.
@_date: 2015-11-19 01:19:43
The default policy was extended to allow for datacarrier outputs for two reasons:
* Including a hash to commit to external data with a payment. This is no longer necessary, as better methods have been found for doing it and nobody ever actually implemented a standard using it in this way.
* We don't have a viable way to prevent abuse of p2pkh scripts for spam, and OP_RETURN with the same data is *less* harmful to the network. Until we can block the former, therefore it makes sense to tolerate the latter to *minimise* damage.
Datacarrier outputs are also useful for the payment codes idea, but unfortunately Justus has failed to do that, opting instead of abusing p2pkh (yes, exactly the same abuse the datacarrier policy was added to reduce the damage of, and almost just as damaging as that case).
It might also have some use for Counterparty-like stuff, but they haven't proposed any BIP drafts yet, so maybe they'll find something better before they get to the draft stage.

Initially, the lowest bidders will have to wait for non-peak times to confirm. Then weekends. Then finally the lowest bidders will stop getting confirmed at all (until they become higher bids by their recipient(s)' use).
If OpenBazaar wants 8tps, it will simply need to scale properly. Making blocks bigger is *not* the solution. There is no reason even 5000tp*s* needs &gt;1 MB blocks. More scalable usage will afford to pay higher fees, and the inefficient "everything on the blockchain" will get left in the dust.
There's no such thing as a free lunch: if OpenBazaar gets anywhere near 8tps, the people who depend on it should be expected to fund development of the network and scaling solutions. The risk of lazy/cheap people just using the current technology with bigger block sizes (at the expense of everyone else!) is a strong argument *not* to increase the limit.

The ones who are pessimistic about BIP148 propose waiting for BIP149 because it will be later (2018 at the earliest, but more likely 2019 or 2020) giving more time for people to upgrade. There are no real benefits to BIP149 itself, and the method of activation is inferior to BIP148.

The only difference old clients will see is:
1. A degradation of security. Full nodes won't be quite as full anymore. (Light clients are never secure anyway, so unaffected)
2. Off-chain transactions *from* segwit wallets might not appear. The old wallet *should* wait until they're on-chain before displaying them to the user. Some wallets *might* fail to implement this security measure, and therefore display them when they're still off-chain, however. But all full node wallets to me knowledge will ignore off-chain segwit spends.

I don't know whether your failure is in understanding banks, or in understanding Lightning.
Banks work by holding some &lt;100% percentage of the funds deposited to them. Not only does Lightning cut off their funding (because you hold your own bitcoins), it requires to be a channel counter-party that they have equivalent funds of their own. So instead of storing &lt;100%, they now need to store at least 100%, and don't have customer funds to use for that storage...
@_date: 2016-10-18 06:00:56

If the full-node part of the network isn't a supermajority, then it is at risk of the economy (in practice, not literally) saying "these made of bitcoins are legit, we have them now amongst us, and you must accept them to continue in our economy".

500k is unfortunately too small right now. I do encourage miners/pools to set a soft limit of 750k for now, and maybe drop it to ~100k once Lightning is production (depending on what the network actually needs).


1 MB is creating enormous centralisation pressures right now: full node count has dropped and continues to drop; mining without a centralised backbone results in significant financial loss; etc. Ideally, we should pick a limit as low as we can get away with (needed for real usage/demand), so as to allow as many people as possible to actually use Bitcoin (which requires a full node under their personal, physical control). Worst case scenario we should probably tolerate long-term would be whatever size miners consider acceptable to forego centralised block relay networks, and use only the p2p network.
@_date: 2016-10-20 08:12:36

@_date: 2015-11-18 03:10:35
Even with optimistic bandwidth growth (30% annually), and with assuming 1 MB is manageable today (which it isn't), the only realistic expectation we could have is for 13.78 MB blocks. But since 1 MB blocks are currently too large for the network, and it's likely we will see less than 30% improvement on average over the next decade, this is clearly way beyond what is possibly reasonable.

Running BIP148 is the only way to minimise risk of split. Decentralisation is better served by not being locked-in to a specific node software brand (Core). Fees can be reduced by switching to Lightning, which requires Segwit (which will be available on the BIP148 chain).
The only downside to the BIP148 chain from this perspective IMO, is that Segwit increases block size, which may make decentralisation worse in terms of node-percentage.

Sure they could. They'd just have to send it like a normal transaction, not merely spam.


Again, there is no blacklist - SatoshiDice is not affected by it, only spam they produce is.
Additionally, since the list is hardcoded in the patching, there is no central place to manage it - nothing for someone to gain control of.
And finally, the code is not even useful for actual blacklisting, since it only filters by very specific transaction types that do not occur with normal bitcoin usage.
If someone wanted to implement a blacklist, they would have to start from scratch, because none of the patch provides anything they would need for that purpose.

When it comes to setting future minimum requirements, optimism is a *bad* thing.


Unfortunately, while *technically* true, it isn't *practically* true. Softforks can only be enforced by miners, who could just as well voluntarily make smaller blocks than the limit. So in practice, reducing the limit against the miners' will would effectively be a hardfork.


I bet this average doesn't consider monthly bandwidth limits...


No, 5 Mbps is good only for about 2.3 MB blocks. Your math is wrong because you can't spend the whole 10 minutes block interval uploading the block. Even 30 seconds is too long. And if the average node only uploads to one peer, the propagation delay across the network is unsustainable, so the average must be capable of handling 7 or 8 peers.
So do the math correctly: 5 Mbps * 30 seconds / 8 peers / 8 bits-per-byte = **2.34375 MB/block**


SPV mining breaks Bitcoin for light/SPV nodes completely. The fact that miners have done it is strong evidence that 1 MB blocks are too big.


This is not true. Even if they operate as a leech-only node, they will take longer to download the big blocks produced by others, resulting in a higher stale rate.


Nodes are responsible for setting their own mempool policies such that they remain within available resources. Miners should never be mining spam in the first place, and them doing so would make this problem *worse* because it turns an *optional* resource usage into a *mandatory* resource usage. Finally, since the spam should never get mined, the block size does absolutely nothing to clear a mempool filled with spam.


No, at best this would be true if there was actual capacity to pay the additional fees. But that would still require bigger blocks in practice (not merely a limit increase), which would break the network to the point of being unusable. An unusable network cannot sustain itself.


That Bitcoin's "industry" is ignorant enough about this to support a suicide proposal, is the biggest threat to Bitcoin's continued existence than we have ever seen. Why do people worry about Bitcoin's enemies, when our friends are happy to sabotage the project?


Satoshi entrusted multiple people to "take his place" in different capacities. Gavin was entrusted with the Bitcoin Core project. Theymos was entrusted with BitcoinTalk. Sirius was entrusted with Bitcoin.org. Of these three, Gavin is the only one who supports BIP 101 - and that he wrote it is clearly a conflict of interest; the other two strongly oppose it. And note that Gavin himself freely entrusted Wladimir to succeed him as Bitcoin Core lead developer, so he doesn't even hold *that* title anymore. And finally, appeal to authority is kinda stupid anyway if we're trying to make a decentralised system...


This is not a good thing! It indicates that the proponents do not understand consensus systems. People who *do* understand how Bitcoin works, know that you can't just release a client with a hardfork until it has nearly universal agreement.

This just adds new rules to the system. Nodes or miners need to enforce the rules for it to do anything. **There are already rules preventing inflation.** So if someone is hardforking to inflate Bitcoin, they could just as well remove these rules in their hardfork as well.

You said "minority of a community". That's the nodes.


I don't know what you mean by this. The "security" provided by miners is not economic in nature.


The majority of miners are *already* attacking us by intentionally blocking Segwit. BIP148 is just saying "okay, fine, if you're going to abuse our trust, we won't delegate it to you anymore; Segwit is now activating". Miners have no right to control the network; they serve the network.
Already, a PoW change is appropriate. Using a UASF is just giving the miners yet another chance to behave. If they then force our hand to do the PoW change anyway, that's their problem.


Even if that is so, it is going to happen either way. The only choice we have now, is to make it successful, or try to stop it with a chain split. I see no value in trying to stop it; it is what the community wants, so I aim for success.


IMO no. Not only because of what I just explained, but also because it has already been successful on Vertcoin and Litecoin.

Installing cable here (just going the 1 mile) would cost $30000-$45000. Nobody wants to eat that cost, and the cable company's contract with the city doesn't require them to do it in our neighbourhood.

That sounds about right, since legacy nodes are effectively cooperating in a hardfork "removing" BIP148 once it activates.

@_date: 2015-11-11 04:36:21
These web wallets you promote are in fact *less* secure than MtGox-style webwallets, since they cannot take advantage of the best practice of having an offline wallet (all funds must be online).
And no, those four points are not just semantics, they are all critical aspects to trustlessness. Also, there is literally *zero* security benefit to locally stored private keys (especially in a browser) with automatic updates - the only "benefit" there is for the provider to make a legal/regulatory argument that (hopefully) won't hold up in court.
@_date: 2015-11-19 08:08:42
That public key will be revealed when you attempt to spend it, before your transaction confirms. Therefore, if I have a quantum computer, I can operate a relay node that attempts to double-spend any transaction it sees. With good connectivity, this will likely have a better than 50% success rate.

scriptPubKeys and whole transactions as well. But while you don't need to *store* them, everyone does still need to *download and process* them. That is somewhat unavoidable without compromising security. This also means they need to be *available for download*, so likely nodes will keep some fraction of unnecessary data around to upload to new peers.

But for a UASF, the "happy case" is *much* more likely than with a HF. The miners are few in number, and strongly incentivised to comply with the UASF. With a hardfork, *everyone* (not just miners) must comply for it to work, and there is no real incentive to do so.

Yes, they can hardfork to change the PoW algorithm.
If there's wide community support, the remaining 60-90% of miners could also make the anti-segwit blocks invalid with an adhoc softfork (which would result in segwit activation triggering with 100% support). Note that if there is real disagreement among the community, however, this would essentially be a 51% attack on the network.
@_date: 2016-10-16 22:57:37
There was *one time* where a group of Chinese miners *asked some of us* to fly out *at their expense* and meet with them to discuss hardforks. While there, they proposed an agreement wherein the five developers present would work on code to perform a safe hardfork, and they would not run *incompatible*\* node software (which would have been shooting themselves in the foot, but may have harmed the Bitcoin economy in the process). Somehow them flying us out there and proposing this agreement translates to us threatening them not to use alternative software.
\* Originally they were going to agree to run only Core, but I (and probably other devs) objected that this would be too much to promise, since miners *ought* to be running forks; hence it was changed to only exclude incompatible implementations.

Segwit is already implemented 100%. The only thing left is deployment. Developers in good faith designed segwit to wait for miners to be ready before activating, but a small mining monopoly is maliciously using their influence to intentionally refuse to be ready, holding everything up.

@_date: 2017-05-20 15:50:52
BIP 148 does not itself cause a chain split. The chain split can only be caused if malicious miners refuse to comply and mine invalid blocks in August. And even then, so long as a simple majority of miners eventually support the network, any chain split will be resolved. And more importantly, the community support Segwit's deployment.
Hardforks don't have these properties.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:45:23
In this case, your "lead paint spinner" ought to be a *smoke detector*. Failure to deploy BIP148 creates a security risk and increases the probability of miners causing a chain split. It's not something neutral like a toy for sale, and other people *are* harmed by not having it.

A mnemonic phrase (N words) is just one way to encode a private key (aka seed). You could also leave it as raw binary data, base58 it, etc.
While technically there is an intermediate "ECDSA private key" state generated by seed-based private keys, this intermediate state is merely an implementation detail and *not* different in any useful sense: if someone gets the ECDSA private key for *any* part of the wallet, your entire seed is essentially compromised. Thus, the seed is itself really the only relevant private key.

It's actually pretty risky for exchanges/anyone to use the legacy chain, since it can be overwritten at any time. The only risk BIP148 users have are that their associates might not use the same chain (which is also a risk for legacy-chain users).

A hardfork, which means near-universal community consensus.


IMO this is best left undecided until the last minute to prevent Bitmain from getting a lead on ASICs to attack it. We can implement a collection of different algorithms and have a signed hardfork signal choose which one (with some kind of 200-of-250 multisig with signers elected by the community).

For privacy, you can just only do the submission over Tor. Note that single-digit probability is only to *bootstrap* the connection between two peers, not the actual transaction itself, which would confirm like any other. Furthemore, that "single-digit probability" could grow rapidly by encouraging more miners to allow for these in their policy (many already do anyway).
@_date: 2016-10-05 21:22:37
No, it would be a soft-fork. But it's also not a good idea, and IMO would be grounds for a vote of no-confidence in the miners enforcing it.

Because that double spend might not meet your usual policy for relaying. So you are faced with a decision: relay it anyway, or don't relay it. If you relay it anyway, then it's easy for anyone to force your node to relay anything and max out your bandwidth constantly. If you don't relay it (this is what XT does), then it's trivial for the double-spender to avoid detection and your detection only works on legitimate/innocent double spending, making it useless.

You should never need to see keys at all - these are wallet internals.

* It's inevitably because sidechain blocks can introduce more bitcoins than the main chain (currently limited to 25 BTC) - although a sidechain may very well place limits on that.
* The SPV-peg variant also only has SPV proofs for the main chain, which reduces the pegged coins to SPV security (same as "light" wallets).
* Another issue at hand is how miners are incentivised to not attack the network: bitcoin has a 25 BTC subsidy, but sidechains might depend on transaction fees or demurrage, which then depend on sidechain volume/storage.
These three are not necessarily exhaustive, but I think are the *main* security differences.

Right now, on average, 63% of blocks should be found in less than 10 minutes. If you limit the maximum time of blocks to 10 minutes, then your average block time drops significantly.
Additionally, by adding time directly to the equation, you are creating a rule that all nodes must perfectly agree on the time, *and* the time at which candidate blocks were found. This is impossible, so it would result in consensus failure. Furthermore, even if it were possible, it would be impossible for nodes to function if they were not operated 24/7 - including making it impossible to bootstrap a node after the blockchain starts using this technique.

While other commenters are correct about flaws in this article, it does make a good point that every technology has tradeoffs, and sometimes progress in one area (eg, raw capacity) may slow or pause in favour of another area (eg, speed/reliability/SSD).
The take-away is: even if we build based on assumptions of some realistic growth, it is possible we may get caught in a hiccup which then is never caught back up to entirely.

Hopefully they will actually research what blockchains do, and realise they have no use case, and then go implement their goal use case in some sane way (ie, without a blockchain).
Obviously this does not apply if some company has an *actual* valid use case for blockchains. But blockchains do not necessarily require mining in the Bitcoin sense - a centrally organised blockchain could very well just use traditional asymmetric key signatures. If a blockchain needs a mining incentive, it will soon be possible to make them bitcoin sidechains, even for no reason other than to use bitcoins for fees.

Your address ceases to be related to the output once you receive it. So you got an output with 1 BTC with serial code (eg) 2023. When you send your friend 0.01 BTC, the transaction has serial code 2023 as the input, and two outputs: one to your friend for 0.01 BTC, and one to your wallet for 0.99 BTC. Each of these get assigned a new serial code (and a new private key).

There is no way to "send it back", since bitcoins *do not* come "from" any address ever. There is also no way anyone can prove they sent it. Since they had no guarantee anyone would have received it at all, I don't think you can be held liable to try to figure out who it belongs to either, and IIRC in cases like this it's yours anyway (but IANAL!).
@_date: 2016-10-13 11:34:01
Yes, HD wallets essentially only have one real private key. There's no guarantee compromising a derived privkey will compromise the parents, but it's rather likely to.
The exception might be when you use hardened derivation. IIRC, that breaks the link so you can't go backward through it to discover the parent keys.

Addresses are/were a way to represent the recipient and purpose of a transaction. Internally, they are implemented by translating them into a pubkey-script for the output, but such a key is not identical to the address. The payment protocol also *can* use similar pubkey-scripts, but that doesn't mean they're using addresses.
I don't know what Lightning uses at a low level. Presumably it must also have pubkey-scripts involved somewhere, since every Lightning transaction is a valid blockchain transaction - but it seems probable that there is a more abstract identifier used to represent users somehow, to calculate cut-throughs.

@_date: 2016-05-12 21:25:17
Not strictly speaking, I think. But you could just as well do it with a single transaction paying thousands of recipients. So the additional data to do it gratuitously inefficiently could arguably be considered spam by some...maybe?

@_date: 2017-05-07 23:51:44
That's 10 GB per month. Bitcoin today will use at least HALF of that - far beyond a reasonable "piggy-back" allotment. Once segwit doubles the block size, it will barely *maybe* be sufficient as a *dedicated* connection just for Bitcoin, and that's assuming the block size average remains at or below 2 MB (unlikely).
Additionally, that's just looking at downloading. Satellite has *terrible* upload speeds. For Bitcoin to work, the typical peer needs to be able to upload at least as much data as they download to multiple peers. But with this connection, forget even matching it!

There is nothing unnecessary in segwit, which fixes the unintentional-malleability bug and thereby enables *real* scaling in addition to (the far less important) increasing the block size limit.
Furthermore, you can't just make x MB blocks without additional complexity because of another bug (which segwit also fixes) in signature verification time.

I see the Ethereum project as a crowdfunded way for a group of (presumably; I don't know all of them) smart people to learn about consensus systems by reinventing one from scratch. A lot of people take issue with how they raised funds, however, and I personally would have suggested they learn how Bitcoin works before trying to design their own system (Vitalik at least is more familiar than average with Bitcoin, but his involvement in the Bitcoin development community was always near zilch).
On smart contracts, specifically the quote you gave, I notice a strange thing: *"system would then check the final score of the game via the web ... No bookie needed."* Except... "the web" doesn't refer to anything. You would need an oracle for this. And guess what? That's something Bitcoin already supports today. This quote seems to be implying it is somehow decentralised, but oracles (and the goal described) require a level of centralisation, no matter what the system does.
Bitcoin's *current* scripting language does leave room for improvement. We did a very minor one with BIP16. It will likely be improved further in the future - it isn't set in stone.
"Decentralised everything" simply is *not possible* until a consensus system is capable of emulating an AI that watches the sports game, knows the rules, and can detect fake video (including staying ahead of new faking techniques!). This is *not* something Ethereum or anything else will do anytime soon. In fact, I wouldn't expect it to be possible until zk-SNARK can do it, and by that point Bitcoin is just as viable a platform today as Ethereum could be tomorrow.
tl;dr: Ethereum doesn't really offer anything significant that Bitcoin doesn't already support, and the minor improvements it makes are things Bitcoin can adopt itself. It's great to have people studying consensus systems, but I don't expect a real cryptocurrency to come about from it.

Even a zk-SNARK sidechain is vulnerable to miners stealing funds involved in a peg (although perhaps there are ways to mitigate that). Note that even the main chain is vulnerable to 51% of miners stealing via double-spending. There is no perfectly secure solution.

IsStandard() is, as you note, policy. Policy is not within the realm of standardisation, since it is a per-node decision at the whim of the node operator. It would be improper for a BIP to try to define policy.


Nodes can adjust policy overnight. Default policies may be relevant unfortunately, but even that can be adjusted at the same time as deploying actual support for it (probably faster).

If he has just slightly more hashing power than the rest of the network, he can trick the other miners to building on each of his 750 blocks, while ignoring (and thus making stale) their own blocks on a 50/50 basis (that is, discard half of the other miners' blocks).
@_date: 2015-11-19 07:22:31
It's not practical as a consensus rule, unfortunately. Nodes would need to keep an index of every address ever used. :/
Also, even without address reuse, the only way to remain secure once quantum computers exist, is to stop using Bitcoin immediately. Merely not reusing address will *not* keep you safe after quantum computers are online, it only provides an upgrade path to a hardforked neo-Bitcoin.

Some users have already stated they do not intend to abandon it even if it fails to get an economic majority. I agree that some minimum level of mining support is required, but that may be much lower than you expect: a miner-minority UASF behaves very similarly to a hardfork, so in this scenario they basically have nothing to lose by hardforking to modify their difficulty down.
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:08:14


They're separate, but not really. Every full node *must* process both the base and extension block. The only "flexibility" they add for the future, is the ability to make blocks as large as 49 MB, but that's not only for future use: miners can do it immediately when/if their proposal activates.


It's much cleaner conceptually and in code, delivers all the same benefits (although just 2 MB blocks, not 5-49 MB which are known to be very unsafe), and is entirely backward compatible as a (real) softfork.

You're correct. For that reason, I think of the three scenarios, we *should* do a PoW change. The *safest*, however, is the community-coerced MASF. Since that won't be ready in time for segwit (this BIP is for post-segwit recurrences), the safest option is UASF.
So for segwit, we as a community need to choose between UASF or PoW change. If we cannot decide, then stagnation is the default.

No, I don't.


Trying to *force* nodes and miners to participate in things against their will by spamming is not a valid answer.




1 satoshi transactions are already filtered by most miners (far more than the few that exclude OP_RETURN).


"People want to do" is not an excuse to abuse the resources of others who may not want to do it. Regardless, I agree that a low volume datacarrier (OP_RETURN, not UTXO bloat) would be reasonably acceptable - but as mentioned Factom is already doing that. So for a new system, it would seem appropriate to overcome Factom's problems, especially this one.


What ChronoBit is mainly missing is a way to get data added as a non-miner. I would suggest extending Bitcoin's existing flood network for this, but I'm not sure how to work out the fee side to prevent spam flooding (it becomes more obvious when Lightning is implemented to just setup micropayments to relay nodes and miners).

Seriously? If miners and payment fraudsters collaborate, the miners will simply always choose a policy in favour of their fraud. Complaining about a policy "failing" in this scenario is ridiculous.


This isn't true at all. There is a *variant* of scorched Earth that could require it, but that's another topic.


Unconfirmed transactions are *already* "useless" in this sense. Even if 100% of miners ran the current default policy, it would still be easy to double-spend unconfirmed transactions. That's why we have the blockchain at all: to confirm them.
It's misleading to refer to unconfirmed transactions as "0-conf" because they really *are not* confirmed. If people want zero block confirmed transactions, that's something possible via the Lightning network. It isn't something possible with the mere p2p flood-network we have today.

You shouldn't think of wallets as a service: that implies you're trusting someone else with your money. While online banks work reasonably well for fiat, that's because fiat is somewhat imaginary in the first place: when they screw up, they can just hit "undo". Bitcoin is entirely unforgiving of mistakes, so the technology to secure it against adversaries frankly *does not exist* at this point in time. Best you can do is keep it offline or in small quantities.
Of wallet software, the only one I can recommend is Bitcoin Core. Hopefully with time others will catch up.

UASF just activates Segwit. Once it's active, normal Segwit nodes are fine.
The catch is if miners split the chain: in that case, all non-UASF nodes (Segwit-enabled or not) will be on the non-Segwit blockchain.
@_date: 2016-10-10 23:07:27
Maybe. But if segwit doesn't have wide agreement, then it *should* be blocked until it does.

There's bits and pieces of other reasons (like poor usability) in why, but the main one is that I have the impression bitcoin.com's forum is reactionary to theymos's moderation of altcoins on reddit, and since that moderation seems to basically be good, negative reactions to it aren't something I want to encourage, and I don't expect many people to be using bitcoin.com today besides those who disagree with that policy.

The only correction I have to make, is that a year in advance does *not* make a hardfork 100% safe.

MASF has a lock-in period etc. If they began signalling bit 4 now, it would enforce bit 1 signalling no sooner than late June (probably July realistically). So it would get us Segwit 1 month sooner at best. Not worth the additional complexity, and not worth the risk that the miners will back out just like they did a year ago.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:08:46
Re-deploying segwit this way has a lot of non-obvious risks. BIP 148 is a better way to go, if you want a UASF.
@_date: 2016-10-20 09:53:08
I didn't read Johnson's draft specifically, but generally MAST relies on giving the verifier the answers upfront, and the verifier checking them. This is needed because those answers determine which paths are cut-out of the script. But as a side effect, what it also allows is effectively turning any turing-complete script into a not-needing-to-be-turing-complete one. Since the prover must provide the answers upfront, each loop has a well-known number of iterations, for example. So the final script is not turing-complete, but is the evaluation of a turing-complete input-script.

Because the situation is that we need a UASF or PoW change anyway. We might as well get it over with using BIP 148 and avoid the chain split. We gain nothing by putting it off a few years while we wait for BIP 149 to be ready.
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:40:58
Because you hit the potential-chainsplit scenario sooner, you get to also observe how the community overall reacts and resolves it upfront. With BIP 149, you might *never* hit that scenario, and therefore never find out how the situation would get resolved.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:05:01
No, if the community can be forced to relax its rules, then Bitcoin is a failure. In other words, stopping BIP148 is literally a hardfork at this point.

Every single person owning or spending bitcoins, is harmed by the address reuse of others. If you can identify that Joe did transaction XYZ, you know that Fred, Bob, Mark, Greg, et al *did not* do that transaction.
More directly, if Joe is sending those bitcoins to Pieter, Pieter's privacy is directly compromised (and vice versa). It is even possible that Pieter may be *unable* to receive bitcoins sent to the same address twice (this rule is necessary to make a wallet immune to malleability), and thus there may be an actual loss of value for him and/or Joe (depending on who is held liable for it).

t;dr: Simplifies scaling to merely "larger block size is the goal to be reached", which is clearly wrong; the goal should be enabling Bitcoin to be usable for drastically more people, which larger block sizes does not help much. Describes a soft hardfork, as the only safe way to do a hardfork (and says it is the same as a softfork). But overlooks the reality that backward compatibility must be maintained even with a hardfork (soft or otherwise), since historical blocks must be accepted before the new ones - there is no reduced technical debt from hardforks, period. Confuses the minor changes segwit makes to transaction structure as if it forces a rewrite of all Bitcoin code (it doesn't, just a few minor changes in wallet libraries). Continues to FUD about segwit, ignoring the reality that a soft-hardfork has most of the same development concerns, and our experience developing segwit has helped tremendously toward understanding what it will take to do the soft-hardfork. Seems to ignore the critical importance of needing consensus before even a soft-hardfork.


The cons are that 1 MB blocks have already broken the network, and it is yet to be determined whether compact blocks will sufficiently improve the situation to even make segwit's 2 MB blocks safe, much less even larger ones.

BIP 148 begins August 1. We will know almost immediately if there is a chain split. Perhaps it will take a month to see if the non-UASF side dies off; hopefully people will just switch to BIP 148 preemptively to avoid any splitting.

Signatures are still included in transactions. While you *could* store them separately, the same is true without segwit, and segwit's implementation doesn't change this. In any sane Bitcoin implementation, signatures are not stored in a database at all, not before nor after segwit. Nor are they kept in a separate data repository.
Saying "it is a soft fork" is meaningless to most people. And those familiar with the term, often don't have a correct understanding of what it means.
Segwit does not free up space in the block at all, merely increases the block size limit by replacing it with a new "block weight" metric that counts signature data as less (even though it doesn't actually use any less space or bandwidth).
Putting more transactions on-chain does not improve scalability today.
There aren't any mathematical problems with signatures today, so segwit can't solve them.

Bitcoin addresses are opaque one-time-use tokens to indicate the destination of a transaction. They are often implemented using Bitcoin scripts and at a lower level ECDSA signatures, but the scripts and keys used in this process are *not* equivalent to the address, and in the case of the private key and signature, they are *entirely unrelated* to the address.
With modern wallets, there is a single private key used for implementing the entire wallet. Older wallets used a separate private key per input.


Transactions do not originate from addresses, ever (anyone/anything telling you they do is wrong and providing you misinformation). Also, scriptPubKey is part of the output, not the input.

The economic majority determines the consensus rules of the network miners must adhere to. If the economy is merely using SPV nodes, then the effect is that there are *no consensus rules at all*, and miners can do literally whatever they want (including making more than 21 million bitcoins from nothing, etc). I say a supermajority is necessary, because a simple majority would basically result in a consensus failure, but the exact threshold is not well-defined. Hopefully we will never find out, because either situation occurring is likely to spell the end of cryptocurrency in general.

Re-instating the block size limit could be done with an additional softfork on top of segwit, so I see no reason that segwit wouldn't activate because of it.


If it can't get the widespread agreement needed for a softfork, it certainly can't get the consensus required for a hardfork.
The block size increase is probably the most controversial part of segwit. If it gets rejected, I would expect that to be why.

There are some things that might be a good idea to improve, that affect nodes upgrading late (*after* July) in scenarios where miners are splitting the chain. This has always been a problem for Core, for all previous softforks as well. It's more of a nice-to-have than a strict necessity IMO.
In terms of the softfork itself, on the same terms as previous softforks, the code is simple and done.

Bitcoin is innovative, and has the first-mover advantage. The vast majority of "other cryptocurrencies", on the other hand, are merely clones and do not do anything innovative (they actually function as scams in practice, redistributing money from the losers to the winners).
Note: Exceptions to the "no innovation" rule do exist, but of those the only ones that seem *potentially* viable are:
* Tonal Bitcoin, because it does not require any amount of dedicated adoption to succeed (it is the same "raw material" as normal bitcoins).
* Namecoin, because it is the first DNS based on Bitcoin technology, and outside the original scope of Bitcoin. It does have some serious problems that may make it impractical, however, and if someone makes a competing sidechain, that may be the end of it.
* Freicoin, because it's the "first mover" within an incompatible economic model than Bitcoin. Freicoins deteriorate over time, losing value, and continue to be introduced anew forever.

BIP 148 is a softfork. Softforks cannot ever be anything except a softfork.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:43:18
If "Core" did anything to promote it, it could be argued to be a developer-activated softfork rather than a *user*-activated softfork. It's pretty important that if it happens, it is a UASF.
For Bitcoin to both succeed and not stagnate at the same time, people *need* to keep up with all this and that.

In this case, it's using the same transactions, so it'd be linear. 2 MB would be 2x the number of transactions.

If there's a chain split, everyone will need to pick sides. BIP 149 won't be able to fix it - it's just a second go in case the BIP 148 side doesn't prevail.

Signalling Segwit does not imply the block is Segwit-enabled at all. The former can only happen *leading up to* Segwit activation, and the latter only *after* Segwit activation. So there is actually never any block that signals Segwit which is Segwit-enabled. There is nothing to check besides the signal!
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:33:34


Yes. There is also an equivalent risk that if you *don't* run it, you could get permanently forked from the main chain, if a majority of miners fail to enforce BIP148 themselves. That's the first section of my post.


All miners won't. BIP148 miners will reject that block.

Ideally, the best outcome is if BIP148 were adopted without Core's involvement. But annoyingly, many people refuse to run anything except Core, so it's not unlikely that we may merge and do a release with it provided that the community support is clear beforehand.

Whatever Mike may prefer or not, the reality is that soft and hard forks have different deployment realities.
Soft forks can be deployed by only a miner majority, because the new blocks conform to all the old rules, and the new rules can be enforced simply by "51% attacking" miners who don't comply with them.
Hard forks, on the other hand, necessarily require *every single Bitcoin user* to upgrade, or the new blocks will be rejected.

No. That could be right if transactions all paid the same fees, but it's entirely possible (even likely) that the spam is the *bottom* 25% of transactions.


Bitcoin users are forced to download and process the entire blockchain. Long-term, archive nodes are required to store it all basically forever. This has value to non-Bitcoin use cases, such as backups, advertising, etc. If the cost is low enough, it will get abused for those things.

* Technology tends to improve approximately enough for 18% more per year.
* The blockchain size is currently about 120 GB.
* 18% of 120 GB is 21.6 GB. So that means to avoid an ever-increasing cost to sync, we need the blockchain to grow slower than 21.6 GB/year.
* There are 52596 blocks per year.
* 21.6 GB ÷ 52596 blocks = 411k/block average.
* Therefore, the average block size must be &lt;= 411k to *maintain* the current several-days-on-high-end-PC sync time.

Today's "SPV" clients are simply insecure regardless of this. Nobody who needs confirmation should rely on them in the first place. If they do, again they are at fault for their own negligence.
(It's also important that economic recipients not use "SPV", because if the economic majority were using SPV, Bitcoin basically falls apart completely.)


No, it isn't. Stale blocks (what you're erroneously calling "orphaned") happen *normally* quite often, and you just need to re-try your attack until you catch one. There's not many attack motives that care about 100% success every attempt.


No, it doesn't. You just assume the transaction will be confirmed for the UI. And then if someone tries to defraud you, don't ship. There's no reason to need a special UI for attackers.

Nodes only matter to the extent that they are used to validate incoming transactions (as chosen by wallets wishing to pay the users of those nodes). So a node that has no users is meaningless.

Unlike with failed hardforks, it's not well-defined which side of a UASF-caused split would be considered the altcoin. Perhaps the softfork'd side would be. But the more people running it, the more the risk is reduced.

BIP 141 includes a block size increase to 2-4 MB. If you're increasing the block size another way, they'll cancel each other out unless you do something stupid.

If there's a chain split, you have the same amount of both. The point of selling off the legacy to buy BIP148 would be to hopefully profit off the situation, and end up with more bitcoins than you started with.

1. ASICBoost is not an optimisation, it is an exploit.
2. Even if it was an optimisation, the community has no obligation to allow it.
3. ASICBoost is patented, meaning the patent holder, using the power of the government, now de facto regulates who is allowed to mine.
4. ASICBoost transforms SHA2 from a mostly-ASIC-friendly algorithm, to an ASIC-resistant algorithm, which encourages monopolies on production of miners.
5. Bitmain not only monopolises production of miners, they also keep the exploit to themselves, and as a result monopolise mining itself.
6. Bitmain's monopolisation of mining has destroyed SHA2's intended value as a decentralised proof-of-work algorithm. It is now merely proof-of-Bitmain's-approval.
7. Bitmain is now hostile to Bitcoin and abusing their monopoly to prevent upgrades from being deployed to the network.

Accepting the longer legacy chain means you're rejecting the shorter BIP148 chain. You can't just "sit back" unless you stop using Bitcoin - and in that case, you're using *neither* legacy *nor* BIP148.
P.S. There won't be two bitcoins unless the miners continue to be malicious and make invalid blocks once BIP148 takes effect. So long as the economy enforces BIP148, they won't be able to afford to perform that attack.

You can *download* the blockchain via torrent, but you can't sync it. Generally, Bitcoin Core (since 0.10) will download+sync faster than using BitTorrent for the download. If it's going slow, then downloading is probably not your bottleneck (most likely it's your CPU and/or hard drive).

No. Follow the logic in that statement. It's primarily about the risk of the BU chain getting overwritten by the Core chain. In this case, that can't happen - but the *opposite can*. The BIP148 chain can overwrite the Core chain.


That's a big IF. I don't think the code can be made safe that soon. The challenge isn't the UASF, but the segwit re-deployment. It wasn't designed to be re-deployed after the timeout.

Correct. (Assuming miners actually produce 1.9x sized blocks. Nothing *forces* them to do so.)
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:28:50
Segwit can't deliver another increase. The best way we have to do that when the time comes, is a hardfork. (Note that extension blocks are a worse way than hardforks.)

On August 1st, Segwit activation becomes mandatory. Malicious miners trying to stop it may decide to cause a chain split to try to interfere. So long as you and the people you do business with are updated to a BIP148-supporting full node, you should be immune to such an attack.

Look at the top section, on risks for both BIP148 and legacy users.
Note also that "BIP 148 not happening" is not on the table as a possible outcome. It is happening regardless; the only question is how much support it gets.


Taking a miner-delegated activation and abusing it to intentionally block a softfork that has widespread community support and doesn't harm anyone who doesn't use it, is nothing but malice.




BIP 148 *is* the right way. The rush is that a delayed activation will require a *redeployment*, further delaying it (IMO the soonest practical is over a year from now). Lightning is almost ready, and there is a huge probability if Bitcoin doesn't have Segwit, they will just move to Litecoin and give it a year+ lead on Bitcoin. If this happens, Bitcoin may lose its advantage.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:52:01
It will probably just be called "Bitcoin" or "BTC". The chain doesn't split at all unless miners split it, and the goal is to make that impractical economically.
Also, if the chain splits, it will be very dangerous to be on the legacy (non-BIP148) side because it can be wiped out by the BIP148 chain at any time. Exchanges may not want to deal with that risk.

@_date: 2017-05-05 21:58:35
Technically, yes. Socially, no. With BIP 148, there is already a very well-defined socially-established consensus that segwit is an enforced rule. With BIP 149, you don't know for sure until that scenario occurs.

Bitcoin is decentralised. Nothing is official.
While Bitcoin Core was based on Satoshi's original code, I think it's a stretch to say it is the same client.


For a hardfork, every node must relax the rules.


If you don't enforce the new rule, your node is at risk.

It is *actually* up to 4 MB blocks. What's the problem?
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:55:58


Hardforks are not backward compatible. No matter how much the miners support it, old nodes will reject the blocks. Users have no real reason to switch to a hardforked chain just because miners support it.
UASF is just a softfork, so as soon as the majority of miners switch to the softforked chain, the old nodes will sync correctly. Unlike with a hardfork, miners have a *strong economic incentive* to switch to the softforked chain, bringing the chain split to a close rapidly. It is likely the split will never even occur, because everyone knows this in advance.


That's technically true, but it's no worse than the status quo. I'm not sure if it's practical for the UASF to succeed without segwit activating, though - merely 15% miner support over several months is needed for the UASF to activate segwit, and any successful UASF is going to have much more than that.

Each and every participating user says "I won't accept blocks that don't signal Segwit, and any payments to me must confirm in a BIP148-compliant chain". The only way you can pay me in August, for example, is if you pay me on the BIP148-compatible chain. This will only be possible if you also received your bitcoins on the BIP148-compatible chain.
Dummy nodes don't matter because nobody wants to pay them or is paid by them.
Miners won't be able to sell their mined bitcoins unless their blocks are valid on the blockchain everyone wants coins on. Once 51% of miners switch to the BIP148 chain, legacy nodes will too, and everything will just work. With enough adoption in advance, miners may simply decide not to try to resist the new rule, and then the chain won't even split.

Pretty much every part of this article is outright *wrong*.
1. Blockchains are *not* useful for storage. That isn't what they do. Cloud storage is certainly possible in general, but it has no need of nor benefits from a blockchain.
2. Smart contracts are something blockchains are useful for, but their examples are garbage. The blockchain can't know if "a blue widget is delivered" - you need a third-party to make that judgement. Neither can the blockchain know if a marriage contract has not been upheld.
3. Proving a technology was created is no substitute for patents. Does the author of this even know what patents are? In any case, proof of existence does *not* require/use a blockchain, only the DMMS. Nobody has made a *sane* proof-of-existence implementation yet, but it could be done quite simply.
4. Nobody has purported how a blockchain can be reliably used for voting. All such attempts have been insanely vulnerable to censorship. Decentralised voting may be possible, but it's *really hard* and unlikely that a blockchain is useful in solving it.

I can only recommend Bitcoin Core on a secure system (preferably offline except when you're syncing it).

The latter. You can send bitcoins to be redeemed by any script. Only a few script templates are used by addresses.

Should be no problem as a sidechain, at least compared to being an altcoin. In terms of problems it has [regardless of sidechain or altcoin], I can think of a few:
* Zerocash requires a trusted third-party to initialise the blockchain. This third-party can fabricate/counterfeit as many coins as they want without being detectable.
* If fees are hidden (implied by amounts being hidden, but there may be ways to workaround that), there is literally zero information for miners to distinguish spam from non-spam. A blockchain without spam protection is easily DoS'd.

Why do you spread such lies?

BIP148 is a softfork to activate Segwit beginning in August.
As with all softforks, if miners are malicious they can split the chain. Nodes need to enforce the rules themselves to avoid being vulnerable to such an attack.
Since it is known/expected that miners are now malicious, it is important for enough of the economy to upgrade so miners only hurt themselves if they split the chain.
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:34:39
This is an effect of the block size increasing. Early Bitcoin had small blocks, so they sync faster.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:08:04
Good idea.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:29:06
Note this wouldn't actually work for BIP 148 (although there might be a risk for BIP 149).
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:09:05
Blocks with zero segwit txs are perfectly valid under BIP148. The *only* requirement is that Segwit is signalled and therefore activated on the network. Miners remain free to support or not support Segwit itself - they just can't stop other people from using it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:50:12


There is no "base size". If people mean 4 MB, they should say 4 MB. 4 MB is certainly not safe at all.


Not by far. The more people are better-educated on Bitcoin, the more the number of us grows.


Then there will be no compromise and no hardfork. The discussion is over, and we will simply make do with Segwit alone, deployed via BIP148.


Insisting on 4+ MB blocks is what would be sabotaging it.
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:46:18
The UASF is already locked-in.
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:36:00
UASF is more dangerous than MASF, but it is *not* as dangerous as a HF. No matter how consensus is defined, your little 5% big-blockers of the community will never meet it.
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:14:04
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:55:45


As already pointed out, this is wrong. Segwit *is* in *every sense of the word* a true block size increase.


Estimate of 1.55 MB seems low. 2 MB is more accurate today.


Nope. If it doesn't get deployed by Nov 15th, it can just be redeployed again. There is no time limit.
Disclaimer: I only skimmed.

But the outcome expected of that situation is very clear and straight-forward upfront.

Having local wallet software is sufficient to secure bitcoins you already own. However, you need a full node to confirm that you're actually receiving bitcoins. It's of little value to technically control bitcoins you own, if you don't know if you really have any in the first place.

No, BIP148 is not stoppable.
@_date: 2015-11-11 08:06:23
That's one way to look at it.
@_date: 2015-11-19 02:46:54
That potentially compromises the security of the entire payment code, since now you have multiple signatures with which to try to calculate the private key for the notification address, and from there you can combine it with the watch-seed in the payment code to get the private keys for every actual payment. In other words, you're back to the same security issues address reuse already has.

No, they should trade [TBC]( instead.

BIP148 beginning Aug 1
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:45:14
Segwit transactions won't be valid on the BIP148 chain for at least a month after the split. By that time, either one of the chains will be dead, or we'll have sufficient replay prevention in place.
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:11:52


Isn't that likely because they are malleated?
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:32:31
BIP 148 is now past the point of no return. If it *doesn't* succeed, there will be a chain split. The only way to avoid a chain split therefore is to work toward ensuring it *does* succeed. If it took 2 months to get 6%, we need to up the pace to get a large percentage more in the next 2 months.


Not practical. For every miner you buy from Bitmain, you fund them putting 2+ more of their own online to make yours irrelevant. :(


Either UASF or PoW change.
@_date: 2017-05-14 05:01:03
Timestamping and data backup are two motivations. Putting pressure to increase the block size is a more recent one. There are probably more, but we'll probably never know all of them.
@_date: 2017-05-20 04:15:46
The next opportunity to deploy Segwit will be years from now. This would give altcoins a real opportunity to deploy Lightning and surpass Bitcoin enough to be a true threat for the first time ever. Delaying Segwit could very well turn out to be an existential problem for Bitcoin.
I am also not able to stop BIP 148. The community has chosen to go that road on its own, and from this point there are only two possibilities: either it fails, or it succeeds. Failure would set a much worse precedent and possibly make future UASFs harder, and for no gain. Success is positive in every way. So I choose to aide in making it a success.
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:10:15
My stats do handle non-listening nodes, so it's measurable, yes.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:09:19
I mean they could use this to say "no, you don't need BIP148", and then never activate Segwit anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:51:33
But is it signalling BIP148 yet?
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:51:29


Why? What do you perceive as the benefits of extblocks? They're literally worse in every way...
@_date: 2016-05-13 17:45:59
Yes. Stuff like Counterparty (assets) are a grey area, that I generally error in favour of treating as legitimate (provided they don't abuse transaction structures thus harming Bitcoin permanently, like earlier versions did). Factom is unusual in that it is extremely efficient spam - only a tiny amount of spammed data deters a lot more spam that might otherwise happen - so in a sense, it's arguably "worth" tolerating. There's a number of other things that also to varying degrees spam the blockchain, but I'll not try to cover every one here.

@_date: 2016-05-15 17:59:23
Bitcoin was first and is innovative. The rest are just "me too" copycats for the most part. Even the notable exceptions that do a bit of innovation themselves\* can't really compete with Bitcoin's network effect.

There is no guarantee you will ever be able to safely spend those bitcoins. Even *without* quantum computers, there is a risk of loss when you reuse addresses. The only supported-to-be-reliable use of bitcoin addresses is one-time.

With the current software, you would indeed get stuck on the last legacy block before you upgraded, *until* the BIP148 chain overtakes *that* block (but not necessarily the legacy chain).
This has been a bug for all past softforks in Core, and can be worked-around using the `invalidateblock` RPC/debug tool.
However, while fixing it can cause complications for most softforks, since BIP148 only affects block headers, it would be trivial to have the node check for this at startup and adapt. We plan to have builds capable of this available prior to August. It is not really a high priority, since it only affects people who are updating after July anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:40:39
A-nonymity means there is *no identifier at all*. But Bitcoin transactions always have a pseudonym - hence it is pseudonym-ous, not anonym-ous.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:43:41
All currently-proposed hardforks will guarantee a chain split. Softforks, including BIP148 UASF, *does not* result in a chain split *unless* hostile miners create an invalid chain and too little of the economic pressure enforces it.

Well, if the chain splits, you have an opportunity to sell the legacy coins and buy more BIP148 coins with the proceeds... but this can be dangerous if BIP148 doesn't prevail, so do so at your own risk.
Otherwise, what people are saying about holding the coins yourself.

Address reuse always has severe privacy problems and security concerns. HD wallets don't fix that. Additionally, scanning for every single address ever doesn't scale - big wallets would potentially perform much better if they only check for outstanding invoices/addresses. Furthermore, address reuse is simply unsupported. So any BIP requiring address reuse to work, would be a bad BIP.
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:46:01
There is no magic trick that will make Bitcoin scale. Increasing the block size especially will not help at all.
@_date: 2016-10-18 06:24:56
Witness *does* count in the block size. So no, you can't. It also counts in the block weight, which is going to limit you even more.

This is true, but it only reveals that his argument is outdated. The majority of mining power is now directly controlled by a handful of big corporations.
@_date: 2015-11-20 16:05:02
They could ban bitcoin trade, which would prevent any legitimate market from existing/forming in their region.
They could also ban mining, which would probably not have much effect besides preventing it as a loophole to acquire bitcoins.

Maybe you used the first one? Addresses don't have a time limit usually, but they should only be used once ever.
@_date: 2016-10-11 05:00:41
Not quite. SegWit increases the block size limit, which increases the requirements to use Bitcoin. You can't just "not upgrade" without degrading to a less-than-full node.

It requires address reuse and blockchain spam...

It doesn't work like that. If you want 8-10 MB, you want 8-10 MB, not 4 MB.

You don't need a new bit for that. Just deploy BIP148 and it's done.

No, Bitmain specifically.
@_date: 2015-03-28 18:55:24
What is left out, is that since the miner gets the payment, the fraudster *does not get it back*. Therefore, the fraudster has no reason to ever attempt the double spend.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:25:45
Now you're just being ridiculous. Of course you have to use the definition of spam to determine what characteristics spammy transactions have - without definitions, it's just a blob of data. In this case, a specific 40-bit pattern enables you to determine it.
@_date: 2015-10-09 00:20:41
Big unknown.
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:25:10


Not necessarily. If they get too lopsided, they can offer to participate in the opposite direction for a negative fee rather than hit the blockchain. It won't eliminate all need for settlement, of course, but it can improve scaling significantly.


Probably 100-1000x as many users, IMO. Thinking we'll hit 2 MB in a year or two is hugely optimistic. Most likely the wallet UIs *still* won't be ready for mass adoption yet by then.


A temporary "backed-up mempool" is not a problem at all. It just means lower-priority settlements and transactions wait a bit longer for things to clear up.

@_date: 2016-05-07 21:39:28
Transaction fees get paid to the miners, who don't bear the cost of the larger block. Miners can also fake fees trivially, so this would really be no different than removing the limit outright. Also, using static limits also doesn't make work as long as price and costs are variable.

Writing an article like this with *misinformation* just increases the confusion. :(
* Bitcoin Core does *not* aim to keep the block size the same.
* Segwit does not fit more transactions per block, *except* insofar as it increases the block size to 2-4 MB.
* There are no "parts of the block" in segwit. Blocks are as always were, a header plus one big group of transactions.
* "However, since the verification in the ledger is being moved by Segwit, some argue that there are security measures that should be addressed." is entirely nonsensical FUD.
* "According to their website they were the first to fix the security flaws of Bitcoin Core by fixing the bug where a node, or a computer that records a virtual ledger would receive a transaction twice." What is the goal of repeating this nonsense?
* Bitcoin Core has supported parallel block verification for several versions now.
* "On a bad note, many accuse Bitcoin Unlimited as not having a large development team, worrying some that Bitcoin as a whole will become more centralized." This is not the real problems.
* "Without miners Bitcoin would not be as big as it is, since they are the ones who use manpower and thousands of dollars worth of electricity a month to verify our transactions." &lt;-- More nonsense.

The *only* differences are:

2. Implements BIP148 so you begin rejecting blocks that don't signal for segwit on Aug 1.

It's possible, but unlikely. The dangerous situation is where you timelock specific transactions for the future and throw away the wallet.

No, they're not interchangable at all. Wallets hold bitcoins. Addresses are identifiers people send to, to pay an invoice. Your wallet generates the addresses when you request money, and the low-level implementation of an address handles making sure your wallet actually gets the bitcoins sent to the address.

No such thing exists for several versions now.


I mean blocks being more bytes in size.

What he's referring to is actually a hardfork with softfork-like deployment behaviours. So it could cause infinite inflation, infinite block size, etc.

That's 2 MB at the start, and 8 MB at the end, from what I can tell. But it's talking about a "base size", which isn't a thing at all.


It was never discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list AFAIK, nor submitted by the author for assignment, so as things stand, no.

A hardfork requires consent from the entire (100%) community. For better or worse, it seems some non-trivial % will never compromise.
Segwit, on the other hand, is a softfork and as such only requires widespread acceptance. It has that already. The only problem is a few malicious miners, which can be bypassed via a UASF if the community chooses to do so.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:47:41
I can support this idea, but with a few reservations:
1. I think it needs its own name. "Bitcoin Classic" is confusing.
2. You will find that implementing SPV ("We intend to add more functionality to the SPV client, so you can enforce rules without needing to run a full node.") is impossible in practice.
3. Ideally, BU should adopt this so people who invested in BCU on Bitfinex aren't left empty-handed.
Disclaimer: I disagree with the preface descriptions of the two groups.

Yes. Their reasons for not using it are not true: the coinbase is *immediately* prunable (the opposite of un-prunable), and is not in any way included in headers-first downloads. SPV clients would *never* need to fetch it, in any form, while SPV clients *do* need to fetch the merkle links which grow logarithmically with transaction count.

If they retain control of the nodes, it does.


This is already a practical problem with the Bitcoin Core defaults. *If* we're just talking defaults in an initial distribution, then more parties to it (bitnodes in this case) is indeed a good thing. However, nodes need to be maintained, they can't just run with defaults forever. Even if the users don't configure it, they need to manage updates. Any kind of automatic or remote update results in the original sybil problem.

That BIP has a hardfork (increase) and a softfork (decrease). The softfork can only activate after the hardfork has consensus. Basically it is a true compromise, giving both camps (those of us who want smaller blocks, and those who want bigger) what they want. But the small-blocker side can only activate *after* the big-blockers get what they want *and* widespread support exists to lower the limit. If the latter never happens, it goes back to being one-sided for big blocks - no changes to the BIP necessary.
The reason it has failed, is that the increase couldn't achieve consensus, even as conservative as it is. Moving it forward to 2 years isn't going to help it do that. Reducing 18% to 10% might, but it doesn't seem like that will be sufficient.
Maybe people will reconsider after segwit is deployed? Dunno.

Yes, we all have a say, but that's different from releasing code. For example, the lead maintainer, Wladimir, runs BIP148 on his own node too.
I agree that we should also release BIP148 in Core (*especially* since it's less risk than not doing so), but unfortunately all\* the other devs would need to agree before that happens.
So we need to convince them. At least some sound like they will be convinced if community and/or business support of BIP148 grows more clear.
\* Maybe we could merge it despite the objection from one or two devs, but right now there isn't enough agreement.

BIP148 = no chain split, we get Segwit.

Spam filtering is node and miner policy. This isn't the responsibility of the devs, but the responsibility of the people running nodes and miners.

That's a common misconception, but completely wrong. And obviously wrong, too, since everyone knows miner(s) basically comprise of only a few people, nowhere near representative of the entire community.
The point of signalling is to ensure miners are prepared to enforce the new rules for obsolete clients that fail to enforce it themselves. This increases the safety of the softfork (since it's harder to trick an old node into accepting an invalid blockchain), and by doing so enables the softfork to activate earlier than it might otherwise have if everyone needed to upgrade in advance.
Signalling should not even *begin* until it is clear the community widely desires a softfork to be deployed. Nor should softforking software be published unless it seems likely. We're far beyond that point now.

Oops, I figured phrasing it that way would imply it. ;)
If you're optimistic when setting future *minimum* requirements, then the *likely* scenario (which is not optimistic) is that technology will fall behind what is *minimally* required to participate.




It's the same for any softfork. Just nobody is proposing any other softfork miners dislike... How are you confusing it?


The average upload between all the nodes will be 1 time. But if the average node is only capable of one, then propagation proceeds from A to B, B to C, C to D, and so on, each hop taking the 30 seconds (or however long). If there are only 100 nodes, that means the block takes almost an hour to cross the network! Gossip networks, such as what Bitcoin uses for p2p, depend on peers to send to many other nodes to get an exponential propagation effect. Since you can't just plan out which nodes those will be (this is highly vulnerable to manipulation by hostile parties), your average node needs to be capable of being one of those that does the full 8+ peer uplaods.


Which is part of why having your own full node is so essential to using Bitcoin today.


As small as we can reasonably get away with for real-world volume, until we have technical solutions that can enable us to scale beyond our needs without losing decentralisation. Right now, 250-350k/block would be sufficient. (But this is discussing actual block sizes, not the limit, which unfortunately can't be made to change based on real-world usage.)


Except it does work, and (as I already explained) SPV mining is itself an attack on Bitcoin.




You're putting words in my mouth. I never said anyone except the miners should be deciding that. But Bitcoin as a system works by relying on miners to filter spam. If they don't at least make some effort to do that, Bitcoin cannot work because we simply *do not* have the infinite resources required to process the infinite potential spam.




Bitcoin *is* a consensus system.

No, torrents are decentralised, not merely distributed.
Pokemon GO uses a large number of servers.

The protocol says you can consume a "coin" of value 2000 as an input and produce two (or more) outputs "coins" of any value provided they do not overflow the inputs' combined value.


Likewise, you can have two inputs worth 1000 each, and only one output with the combined value.


It ceased to be relevant when that "coin" was used as an input.

This would be assuming the exchange's judgement of "stolen" is infallible.

Lack of information does not tell you *anything*, neither in favour *nor contrary to* a given hypothesis (I'd be surprised if they didn't exist, though). But rather than looking for an appeal to authority, why don't you just try it out yourself? At least that tells you if it'd be an improvement for you... you don't even need to learn tonal either: think about your ordinary every day tasks that involve division, realise you already do more binary math than anything else, and then try doing those same tasks with divisions by five. The classical example would be slicing pizza - next time you have one, cut it into ten slices instead of 8 or 16.

To avoid a chain split, 51% of miners enforcing BIP 148 is sufficient.
If a majority of the economy enforces it, however, miners will have no choice but to enforce it also.
So *either* 51% of miners *or* the economy.

It's not something users should *ever* do, as it poses a serious security risk.
It also contradicts the design of newer wallets: they don't use ECDSA private keys anymore, but rather HD private keys (which are represented by mnemonic seeds). Thus, they have no place to store/import the ECDSA key.

1. Electrum is not a Bitcoin full node, so using it won't provide you the benefits of using Bitcoin. You should reconsider switching.
2. Bitcoin Core only uses the more secure hardened derivation for its HD wallet. I don't think Electrum supports this.
3. Even when the same derivation style is used, HD wallets are generally not compatible across implementations.

No, when you began using Bitcoin, you knew it implied processing others' transactions. So, if you did not consent to that usage, the onus is on you to stop using Bitcoin. The same is not true for spam, which abuses the transaction structure to encode data it was never intended for.


We're not limited to one blockchain. If we have real use cases, we can add more blockchains to support those, and provide the improvements on an *opt-in* basis.

While I agree that it would be ideal to have multiple independent consensus-compatible implementations, this is unfortunately impractical given the current limitations of technology.

Addresses don't exist at the blockchain layer at all. A fixed amount is stored associated with the transaction id and output index, until it is later consumed as an input.
Tracking individual satoshis would gratuitously interfere with increasing precision down the road, bloat the data size required, and seriously harm privacy. It is quite intentional that transactions consume bitcoins, and produce new ones.


Are you just trolling? Bitcoin transactions are currently faster than any competing centralised systems (although in theory the centralised systems *could* be optimised to do better), and the entire blockchain takes about $5 in storage.

I think the only option being seriously considered at this time, is complete removal of the block size limit, concurrent with addition of new limits (similar to the sigop limit) that more accurately reflect block costs.

You cannot eliminate the risk of a chain split by backing out of BIP 148. Things are already moving. It is a "go".
The only thing anyone can do now, is make it less risky, and more likely to succeed, by supporting it yourself. (Or more risky, and less likely to succeed, by failing to support it.)
The only way to avoid a chain split altogether, is for BIP 148 to be such an overwhelming success, that miners activate segwit before August.

Hardforks work by proposing a new cryptocurrency to replace the current one (with an effective premine equivalent to current Bitcoin balances), and everyone using Bitcoin abandoning the old Bitcoin while adopting the new currency as the new Bitcoin.
This means it can change anything so long as it has consensus: the block size, the PoW algorithm, the 21MBTC limit, and yes, it could replace PoW with PoS as well (provided someone comes up with a viable PoS algorithm, which so far does not exist).

There is no *more* responsible way to do this. Delaying Segwit beyond August necessarily means you make the situation *worse*.

I don't know if that letter is a commitment, or just a statement of intention.
Speaking of that letter, it also goes into *reasons why* they made that choice. Just as those reasons compelled them to support Core (against BU), they also should compel them to support BIP148 (against legacy). Specifically, BU's chain could be replaced at any moment by Core's stricter chain; likewise, the legacy chain can be replaced at any moment by BIP148's stricter chain.

This wouldn't be using the multisig transaction stuff. It would need to be new logic specifically for this purpose, and would need to be entirely off-chain (or else the ex-miners could censor it). The data size would be about 15kB. After the hardfork, the final SHA2 block could be hard-coded into node software - the centralised signing would only be needed to have an instant switchover until it is complete.

Well, "6 confirmations" is short-hand for "Confirmed 6 blocks deep", but "confirmed 0 blocks deep" makes no sense, since the transaction is completely *un*confirmed and can easily be reversed (even without RBF).

Yes (excepting softforks).




100%, or pretty close to it. If the nodes rejecting the change (either by wilful refusal to upgrade, or by default if they simply do nothing) constitute a functioning economy, the hardfork has failed and become an altcoin.


People do it to use Bitcoin. If you don't run a node, you're not using Bitcoin, merely trusting someone else who is. You have no security, no privacy, etc. Might as well be using PayPal.




Increasing the block size makes the network *less* healthy, not more. Perhaps miners could bribe everyone else (although that'd be a lot of money; I doubt 15% total would suffice), but that's beside the point.

1. Running a node does nothing useful unless you *use it for your wallet*. You don't need to use Core's wallet itself, but you do need to configure whatever wallet you use, to exclusively trust your node alone.

@_date: 2017-05-16 19:33:16
Which is just another reason why we need to give BIP148 majority support. It's the only way to avoid a chain split.
@_date: 2017-05-05 18:34:18
For two key reasons:
# Decisiveness
BIP 148 is clear and decisive. There is no question "did the softfork success or not?" when it's done: it is obvious that it did (or didn't).
BIP 149 is the opposite: it leaves the question of successful softfork open until some unknown future point where a miner tries to steal segwit-held funds. This may create an uncertainty where people don't use segwit because they fear the funds may be successfully stolen.
# Compatibility
BIP 148 is backward-compatible with segwit as already deployed in 0.13.1-0.14.1. Once it succeeds, nodes going back to 0.13.1 retain full node security, and are not required to upgrade.
BIP 149, on the other hand, requires a new deployment of segwit. No softfork has ever been re-deployed before, and there are plenty of "sharp edges" that could be encountered if we need to do it for segwit. Very little research has been done into the work required to successfully and safely re-deploy segwit. There is a lot that can potentially go wrong: 0.13.1-0.14.1 think they understand segwit, but won't accept it as legit until the BIP 9/141 deployment activates; a redeployment must gracefully downgrade them to non-segwit. If a 0.14.1 node downloads a segwit block instead of the stripped equivalent, it will reject the block because it believes segwit is inactive.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:28:41
Segwit increases the block size by measuring blocks in weight-units (WU) instead of bytes. UTXO-affecting data is counted as 4 WU per byte, while witness data is counted as 1 WU per byte. Up to 8M WU are allowed per block. This enables typical transactions to add up to 2 MB total. However, the be backward compatible, legacy transactions must be weighed entirely at 4 WU per byte, since old nodes will enforce the hard 1 MB limit on that data (but cannot enforce it on witness data, because they don't know it exists).
This hardfork would give the same Segwit-balanced weighing to the legacy transactions too, counting the legacy witness data as 1 WU per byte as well. So now, both legacy and segwit transactions can add up to 2 MB before the 8M WU limit is hit.
In addition, it also adds a 2 MB size limit, so that the spam-block extreme of 4 MB is not a risk nodes need to plan for. This is technically a decrease in some non-typical cases, but it addresses the concern bigblockers have that having this extreme could impact or slow block size increases in the future.

It's far less likely than any other spam filters' false positives.

4-8 MB blocks can't be safe in the near future, no matter how much work is done on the implementation.

Make sure that when they go to Bitcoin meetups anywhere, everyone at the meetup is at least aware of BIP148, and ideally supportive and enforcing it.

There are *never* double spends in the mempool of a Bitcoin Core node. Nor is there any such thing as "the mempool" - every node has its own, and every node defines its own rules for how to manage it... including being able to throw out older transactions in preference for newer ones. I'm not saying don't accept *unconfirmed*\* transactions, but be aware you will probably get defrauded some day (just like merchants who accept credit cards or Apple Pay).
\* There is no such thing as "zero confirmations", just "not confirmed".


No, scrypt is merely a key derivation function that was never intended to be useful as a proof-of-work algorithm, and in fact doesn't even meet the goals of a good proof-of-work algorithm (cheap to verify). Furthermore, it is *based on* SHA-2, and there is no reason to expect it would fare any better if SHA-2 were cracked. Finally, every single scrypt altcoin *uses SHA-2, not scrypt,* for their actual hashing purposes (scrypt is simply too slow), so even if scrypt were secure as a proof-of-work, a SHA-2 break would still compromise them.

Botnet miners historically have cared only about profits, and because they don't want to be traced, use public mining pools. So long as those public pools are honest, the risk to the network seems minimal.

There are quite a few cases:
1. **BIP148 success as a no-op:** Miners activate Segwit before August. No chain split. BIP148 does nothing.
2. **BIP148 perfect success:** No chain split. Miners comply with BIP148.
2. **BIP148 turbulent success:** Chain split. BIP148 kills legacy chain after some time. Potentially more than once, if the legacy chain forks again.
3. **BIP148 success as an altcoin:** Chain split. BIP148 has insufficient economic support to kill the legacy chain entirely, and both chains continue onward.
4. **BIP148 failure:** Chain split. BIP148 has insufficient economic support and eventually dies off.
There is sufficient BIP148 support already that case 5 is probably impossible.

No, there are a few major differences:
1. **Re-deployment**: NYC proposes to re-deploy Segwit on bit 4, rather than BIP141's bit 1. Re-deployment is the part that makes BIP 149 so complicated, and why it is likely to take upward of a year to prepare.
2. **Block size and HF goals**: HK's hardfork proposal did not require a block size increase. It was planned to change the weight algorithm such that pre-segwit txs could form 2 MB blocks, but the actual block sizes would have remained 2-4 MB (as Segwit already provides). Furthermore, this effect was not the primary purpose of the hardfork.
3. **Design-only vs forcing it on the community**: The idea out of HK was to do R&amp;D for a hardfork, and make a proposal we could recommend. We explicitly acknowledged that we could not promise deployment or activation, because these are up to the community and cannot be decided by us. NYC, on the other hand, purports to force an as-of-yet underspecified hardfork on the community.

There is an inherent advantage. ASICs cannot be prevented, but if they are made too complicated to produce, the monopoly situation is ugly. Part of the problem today is because ASICBoost transforms SHA2 into an ASIC-resistant algorithm.
Additionally, CPU/GPU manufacturers like Intel and AMD can produce them dirt cheap - most of the cost comes from paying off the engineer R&amp;D time. These companies could always decide to strip down their CPU/GPU to *only* include the mining functionality, and just own the network.

1. Big blocks are controversial, and hardforks cannot be done with opposition. Many of us would actually prefer a block size reduction.
2. Hardforks guarantee a chain split with anything less than 100% user support, whereas UASF avoids a split so long as it has at least *enough* support (which is probably 51% or lower).

When you receive bitcoins, you should enter a label to tell you later what that payment was received for.

Extension blocks aren't a softfork. Segwit is an unusual case that will allow a one-time increase. There are no more such cases after that.

They're wrong about this being a myth. While [their reasoning is valid, it is not sound]( because the premises are wrong. Specifically, they are assuming that Bitcoin and Lightning are two distinct competing things. But in reality, Lightning is just a complicated smart-contract, and just as much a part of Bitcoin as any other wallet/system. It doesn't make sense to talk about a conflict of interest when both of the alleged interests are the same thing (Bitcoin).

Then that kind of hardfork would be effectively robbing them. Which is part of why any hardfork must have consensus.
@_date: 2016-05-17 00:36:50
Blocks are full of spam. We're still several years off from actually running out of space. Even after segwit is deployed, miners should be expected to keep their soft limits reasonable until the network can handle larger blocks (right now, even 1 MB is breaking things).
Real scaling is Lightning, which depends on CSV and SegWit. Right now, CSV is being delayed mostly by some miners.

ASIC resistance simply means making the ideal ASIC is harder, and therefore a monopoly once someone does it. For example, SHA256d with ASICBoost is an example of an ASIC-resistant algorithm - that's half the problem with our current situation.
Instead, what we should be aiming for is either a readily-available ASIC (eg, a truly memory-based algorithm, which doesn't exist to date), or at least an algorithm for which the best possible ASIC is simple and straightforward to produce, so it is easy to compete in the production of it (and therefore hard to monopolise).

Consensus systems require that every participant take the same input data (UTXO state + a block) and produce the same exact output data (pass/fail + new UTXO state). This includes bug-for-bug compatibility - if two implementations ever disagree on any detail, the whole thing falls apart.
Given current computer science, writing bug-free code is impractical, and therefore writing perfectly matching implementations is also impractical. Therefore, the only way to achieve a working consensus system is to have a single implementation.
The goal of libconsensus is to *isolate* this critical code so that it can easily be shared between multiple competing full node software products. This way, all the full nodes will run the same consensus implementation needed for Bitcoin to work, but everything else can be different.

The upstream target is not "best end user experience", but "clean reference code". The current patch is the worst kind of hacky code possible, directly contradicting the upstream goals in that regard. When clean improvements are done, they do get merged.


It would be so effective that the spammers would change their mode of operation to break the hacky patch. Yet another reason why a clean solution is needed before the mainline code is changed, so they can't just bypass it.


I haven't. The prayers were inserted into a (very tiny) region of blocks originally intended for such use (as opposed to spam which abuses other data structures against the consent of users), as a way of testing code modifications needed to support Namecoin's merged mining.

How is raising the block size a compromise? Many people want is decreased. Leaving it at 1 MB would be the obvious compromise. Reducing it now, but adding code so it grows beyond 1 MB in the future is an even better one.
Segwit gives big-blockers 2-4 MB blocks *while disenfranchising small-blockers*. They should have taken and ran with this.
As education about Bitcoin increases, so does the small-blocker group. Opposition to segwit just decreases the chances of big-blockers getting *anything*.

Bitcoins *never* arrive from an address. I am going to assume you mean the TXOs consumed by the 0.4498 BTC and the "few bits" transactions both happen to have been created when the same address received previous transactions.


Webwallets following best practices *would* do this.

Because the sender is honest, not because it isn't possible to do. RBF does not have any effect on honest people.
If 100% wanted to double-spend today, the % successful would get pulled up quite a bit.

1. XT/Classic are not implementations of the Bitcoin protocol, but incompatible altcoins. You also left out Bitcoin Knots, which is actually Bitcoin-compatible.
2. You're conflating standard transactions with common node relay policies.
3. OP_RETURN outputs are not standard, and are not meant for storing data, but for committing to external data.
4. Bitcoin Core is not official. There is no such thing as official in a decentralised system.
5. The coinbase was never empty, and has always been required to be at least 2 bytes in length. It has always been used as an extra nonce (which is part of the coinbase, not after it), and typically miners use it to tag their blocks or include brief messages. It is also used for merge mining.
6. Your "block structure" is merely a convention used on the p2p network, not part of the protocol itself.
7. When you talk about other blockchains, it would be better to talk about testnets, sidechains, and legit altcoins rather than scam-coins.
8. Light clients do not implement SPV. SPV is not possible today.
9. Bloom filters do not help privacy, and are merely an optimisation.
10. Best-block forks, consensus forks (soft/hard forks), and code/development forks are entirely distinct concepts, and shouldn't be equated.
11. The 1 MB block size limit was at least in technical terms not a temporary softfork (it was introduced without an expiration).

Tor does *not* make Bitcoin anonymous, it *only* hides your IP address.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure how likely that is. The easier it is to setup (and fewer resources), the better chance you have... this is just a short-term limitation in any case, assuming merge mining infrastructure gets properly decentralised as is needed for merge-mined sidechains (which I am working on).


I'd certainly expect fees to help incentivise miners to take it on.

The reason I say "free" here is because non-free people (slaves, employees living paycheck-to-paycheck, etc) are paid after they provide value and basically have no recourse if their owner/employer decides to defraud them. So there is no use for them to see if their salary has been confirmed or not.
Being able to run a node when I am receiving/confirming receipt of my payments is sufficient to make full use of Bitcoin. It just isn't convenient, and not particularly as good for the network.

The getblocktemplate protocol that is used for mining relies on clients (miners) to understand the protocol rules at some level. The current version of the rules has thus far been indicated by the block version number, and compatible clients therefore must refuse to process versions they cannot understand. With version bits, however, the rules are no longer indicated by the version number, and getblocktemplate needs a more fundamental update to convey this information. That update was neglected in 0.12.1, while versionbits was included. So there is no practical way to implement a GBT-compatible miner against 0.12.1. Furthermore, GBT is now the *only* way to mine at the bitcoind level.

Agree with the general gist of this, but there are some minor errors:


This is true, but in a way more subtle than most readers will understand. Miners *never had a vote to take away*, unless they were *also* participants in the economy (which is less and less true these days, but that's not the point). Insofar as participants of the economy go, upgrading to node software implementing such a "flag day" hardfork is the only way to "vote". Miners are not prevented from participating in this, just because they are not given an artificial blockchain-vote.


This is wrong. There is unfortunately no known way to measure 95% adoption, certainly not a line of code.


This is correct, but I'd like to rephrase it slightly:
Liquid is a competitor to *centralised off-chain systems* that already exist within each individual exchange.


I don't think Wladimir dismissed the wider consensus required for hardforks. Technical consensus is not sufficient for block size; it must be accepted by the entire community in general.

~~Indeed, they apparently only invited people they expected to agree!~~ [(Edit: apparently some effort was made.)](
I can think of no purpose other than malice to try to activate Segwit on bit 4 rather than the assigned bit 1. At face value, this would suggest a re-deployment, which itself would probably take a year of R&amp;D to do safely (and that's just for Segwit, not even the HF stuff!).
Last I heard, their "2MB hardfork" part was also 4-8 MB, so blatantly dishonest upfront, and completely unsafe.
That being said... [Lightsword found a sane way to do their part 1]( and I think I can come up with a not-completely-absurd "2 MB hardfork" (that's really 2 MB) if the community were to want to go this route. **Edit: [Here's a not-completely-absurd 2 MB hardfork BIP draft](
But in the meantime, BIP148 is the way forward to ensure that whatever happens out of Barry's little meeting, we still get Segwit later this year. (It's compatible with Lightsword's bit-4 Segwit thing in the event miners do that first.)

As with any hardfork, it would require pretty much the entire community to adopt a new version implementing the changes. Changing the PoW is literally no different in this regard than changing the block size limit, or the 21MBTC cap.

This longer description fits what I said, except:
* The attacks only work against unconfirmed transactions and weak "confirmation" on nodes that have not been updated. This is a minor risk, as there was already a significant probability of these transactions to be reversed even when they were up-to-date. If someone is not only taking this risk, but neglecting to keep their node up to date, such a loss is clearly their own fault.
* In practice, all softforks require a clear miner *super*-majority, so the miners left behind are likely to be negligent miners in the first place, and open to malicious abuse regardless of the softfork.
* Future softforks (see BIP 9) are likely to also require a window of ~2 weeks for miners to upgrade to a newly accepted softfork even after it has reached its activation consensus.


This description *mostly* works for a *subset* of hardforks. Many hardforks (notably including all currently proposed hardforks) necessarily imply that blocks which conform to the old rules *also* conform to the new rules, and new clients will gladly follow a blockchain "softforked" back to the old rules if it has a miner majority.


Since **miners do not define nor represent economic consensus**, your conclusion here is entirely wrong.

SPV mining is an existing problem, not a new one created by Segwit. I think it probably makes sense to deploy some solution either way, but this is probably unrealistically contentious in the current political environment and unsafely large 1 MB blocks.

The tonal system was created prior to computers. Computers just increase its utility beyond what it already was.

Just for inquiring information on an external private key, it'd probably be pretty difficult: they'd need to find a way to save the information and then send it back when you went back online. I wouldn't rule that out as impossible though (what you really want around your private keys). For the website in general, [this thread]( should be insightful.

Its purpose not being to transfer bitcoins, but to merely convey information/communications.

Nope. Bitcoin only works at all because of that tracking data.
@_date: 2016-10-29 22:07:28
The importance of nodes is that they enforce the consensus rules economically. If only 500 individuals ran nodes, and 10000 didn't, when those 10000 see an invalid block full of false payments, they will blindly just accept them as "confirmed", while only 500 people will reject the block. Those 10000 will continue to do business as if the block was perfectly fine, and the 500 who insist on the rules will be left out of the economy. Thus, miners are left free to make their own rules (including theft and inflation) in this scenario. So for Bitcoin to actually work securely, at least a supermajority (maybe &gt;85%) of the economic activity needs to be processed by full nodes the recipients personally control.
In other words, Bitcoin trusts nodes to enforce the rules, and miners only to decide on the *order* of transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-20 11:33:54
Hmm. Miners get paid more for helping spam the blockchain. Something wrong with this incentive. :/

No, you just don't know what you're talking about. The BIP148 chain will *never* accept the legacy chain as a reorg, period.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:52:09
I think it's very likely that if there is a prolonged split, Core will abandon the legacy chain. But each developer would need to decide for themselves.
I know that personally, I will be sticking to the BIP148 chain. At least Wladimir (lead maintainer) is also running BIP148.

August is just when the signal becomes mandatory. So long as the BIP148 chain retains 15% of the total hashpower, this will activate Segwit by the November "deadline".
P.S. It's not a vote.

I'm not suggesting we increase block size any time soon, but note that the Bitcoin network only needs to propagate blocks once every 10 minutes on average - so you'd have plenty of bandwidth left over outside those brief "interruptions", and a good router can make that totally invisible.

No, old nodes are not substantially useful to the network. They might as well be light clients.

Yes and no. To include Segwit transactions, they couldn't use ASICBoost. But Segwit is always optional for miners, even with BIP148, so it doesn't block ASICBoost entirely.
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:39:45
A few minor factual errors here. First of all, the UASF itself will not split the chain. The chain will only split if 51% of miners choose to cause it. Of your "two likely outcomes", the second one is not realistically possible: so long as the BIP148 chain has significant usage, it will eventually overwrite the miner-split chain. The only way for the miner-split chain to survive is if nearly the entire community were to reject BIP148 (which would entail current BIP148 supporters giving up).
@_date: 2015-10-18 00:05:00
Satellite internet doesn't typically have very good upload... which is usually the bottleneck for nodes. I bet there's monthly data caps too, far below what 56k modems can handle (18-19 GB/mo). :(

The simplest way of implementing AsicBoost right now involves breaking the protocol in a way that light clients won't even detect. Effectively (but not exactly), it would be the same old "miners trying to force a hardfork" situation.
Secondly, because of stupid western laws, it is illegal for people in half the world to implement AsicBoost or even import hardware using it. So basically AsicBoost is walking freely into a situation where Bitcoin mining is more or less illegal in these countries - not because the countries have banned mining, but because mining has chosen to go somewhere already banned.

There are no coins from both sides when you're mining (if there's a chain split). Miners only get one or the other. You'll have to contact Genesis Mining and insist they ensure you're mining on the proper BIP148 chain, in order to get valid bitcoins on the BIP148 chain.

Right, they won't see the entire block. Data they used to see will no longer be sent to them. This isn't a "mode" anyone should use, merely a fallback compatibility support.


Yes, only updated nodes will get the real block. Pre-segwit nodes will get a stripped copy.


No, I don't assume that. I mention the fact that spam makes up a significant amount of block space today. It's a minority, but it's still what sets the fee floor.

Well, Segwit alone increases the block size limit to 2-4 MB, so reducing it back to 1 MB would still need an additional softfork. I agree that a hardfork can never be forced, however, and users can back out at any time no matter what.

I think a lot of the community would rather do a PoW change if BIP148 fails to get sufficient support.

Bitfury and a number of smaller miners have stepped forward to support BIP 148 so far.
Barry also claims to have a majority hashrate agreeing to activate Segwit immediately. Since they are still less than 95%, the only way these miners can do what they promise is by deploying BIP 148 also.
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:18:04
As opposed to simply leaving it at 2-4 MB? To reign in the worst-case resource abuse (used as an excuse by bigblockers to oppose Segwit, and useless for honest miners anyway).
As opposed to a larger size *and* weight limit? Because even 1 MB blocks are demonstrably too big, and 2 MB is only acceptable as a compromise.

@_date: 2017-05-30 05:27:34


Nope. A soft fork is simply a backward compatible change. The term has nothing to do with practical deployment issues or chain splits.


Or until new miners start up, or the [malicious] miners building the invalid chain realise the value just isn't there as people sell-off on that chain.


The *chain split* is triggered by a [malicious] miner. The soft fork is enforced by and activated by users. Note how the author of the article is trying to redefine "soft fork" to play word games!


The honest/BIP148 miner doesn't trigger either the soft fork *or* the chain split. He simply builds the next block on the blockchain.


This assumes 51+% of miners are malicious and will cause a chain split. It isn't a likely outcome. In both Litecoin and Vertcoin, merely the existence of BIP148 (equivalents) resulted in miner compliance and no chain split.


It should be noted that the BIP148 chain *cannot* be forced to disappear, *only* the legacy chain has this risk.


Miners are *not* economic nodes!


You don't need a node to sell/send, even securely (well, as secure as fiat-interchangeability can be...).


This isn't true. While there is unclarity with how exchanges might offer the legacy chain's coins given its high risk of being wiped out, that doesn't change the reality that it *can* still be wiped out, and therefore Bitcoin is restored to a single chain.


A 2-of-3 multisig could potentially enable on-chain future trading with a semi-trusted third party. It's not perfect, but it's an improvement that may make futures more approachable and liquid.


I don't think we want the legacy chain to have liquidity, so I disagree that we want merchants to accept it.


Can't stop legacy coins from disappearing. That's a risk anyone takes by accepting legacy coins.


Not necessarily! So long as 51+% of miners choose to comply with BIP148, there will not be a chain split, and miners don't get left with this risky decision to make.


Miners have a *more significant* continuing cost to support the legacy chain. In fact, so long as *enough* miners support the BIP148 chain, they *don't* have any such risk at all. The risk is almost entirely on miners who refuse to comply with BIP148.


Bitfury has clarified they will support BIP148 if "Consensus 2017" fails to activate Segwit by August.


This is false. It assumes everyone is neutral on the softfork, and nobody stands to gain or lose from it. But for everyone who wants Segwit, or wants only a single "Bitcoin", there are significant reasons they would prefer BIP148 succeed.
*Anyone* can put skin in the game by simply selling off their coins on the chain they dislike, and buying coins on the chain they prefer.


Mining equipment is produced by a monopoly which will take the profits and use it against you. For every Antminer you buy to support BIP148, Bitmain now has funding to put 2 or more online to build a stronger legacy chain if they so choose. It's a lose-lose game if you buy the "PoW decides the rules" nonsense! Thankfully, simply enforcing the UASF makes you unaffected by this hostile miner monopoly.
That being said, if you can get non-Bitmain miners, by all means please do to help support the network and UASF. Just don't expect it to break even. :)
The rest of this article is based on the false premise that only miners can have skin in the game, so I'm done.

Actually, that's not true. Segwit is basically the most straightforward way to fix those problems. You could possibly move the txhash commitment around in a hardfork, but it's not a big difference.

No. Segwit has 2-4 MB blocks. Segwit2x has 4-8 MB blocks. And people can consent to things that aren't necessarily fine. Finally, Segwit2x is a contentious hardfork, whereas Segwit is just a softfork.
So the argument is 2 (or 4) MB blocks via softfork are *acceptable*, and 4 (or 8) MB blocks OR contentious hardforks are not.


No, you can't.

UASF isn't opt-in. Segwit is.
If miners split the chain, that's a 51% attack. It doesn't really make sense to intentionally make yourself vulnerable to it.
Everyone should be UASF-only. Even if you don't like Segwit, upgrading to BIP148 is the only way to remain secure. You can still choose not to use Segwit.

*Both* bloat the blockchain. Valid payments unspent *also* bloat the UTXO set, which everyone using Bitcoin must keep in *fast random access* storage (eg, RAM).


If you spent them, the entire payment code is potentially at risk of being compromised for the same security risks address reuse has.

Nothing was done in secret. Last time, the changes were not clearly documented, so I apologised, and explained the plan going forward (document properly and restore them as defaults in 0.10). The Gentoo community had months of time of open review of the new ebuilds in advance. The final ebuilds were clearly crafted to ensure nobody could accidentally get something they weren't expecting.

Leave out the slash.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:57:08
That's only if you use Segwit UTXOs, which don't and can't exist still for at least a month after the chain split begins. If the UASF chain were to die, it would die sooner than that. So it's a non-issue.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:04:00
I suggest:
* Find a way to make the swap file on the external hard drive. Flash doesn't handle swap well. Maybe even do this without swap (set dbcache lower in bitcoin.conf).
* Use the default /home/USER/.bitcoin directory, instead of naming it bitcoinData.
* If you're going to run the GUI, enable the wallet too. A node isn't very meaningful unless you use it for your wallet.
* If you're going to use another wallet and point it at your node, don't use the GUI. It doesn't add much...
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:36:33
Indeed. A chain split would be bad. But the only way to avoid a chain split is to make BIP 148 a success.
Note that when you say "activate later", you're talking years from now.

I think so as well. Core should merge BIP 148. It's just a matter of convincing the few holdout devs of this.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:38:52
BIP 149 is not complete, and introduces a lot of complexity, both known and unknowns. IMO it is highly probable that 4 July 2018 is *too soon* for it to realistically be ready.
BIP 148 is simple, ready now, and already being deployed permanently. The more people that adopt it, the smoother the upgrade will go. If 51% of miners switch, there will be no chain split at all, and the more users who switch make it clearer to the miners they have no choice.
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:01:42
No, PoW change is the nuclear option. BIP 148 is just another softfork. And BIP 148 is happening. If you don't want to be on the wrong chain, be sure you update your node to support it before August.

No, the problem with Bitcoin right now is centralised miners, and miners hostile to upgrades in the network.


Not even going to try. If BIP148 fails, I will probably be working on a new altcoin based on it. Already other Bitcoin developer(s) have begun defecting to Litecoin.

@_date: 2017-05-18 20:47:36
Hardfork requires *everyone*. Softfork (incl UASF) requires *enough*.
Hardfork gives no real incentive for the legacy nodes to follow miners. Softfork gives a *very strong* incentive for the miners to follow the economy.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:37:55
If miners don't enforce BIP91 themselves, a few users (which is all 2 days can get) won't change that. If you could get as many people as there currently are BIP148 users, *maybe* it'd make sense, but otherwise, users should just run BIP148.
The only way to make a BIP91 (or better yet: BIP148 adapted for BIP91) safe for users to run, is if Core were to do an emergency release with it, which doesn't appear to be the case.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:43:12
The arguments around it are mostly about whether developers should be pushing for it or not, and whether it will be successful or not. I don't think there is any opposition to the UASF idea itself.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:45:56
UASF works fine with a mere majority, but a hardfork requires unanimous consensus from everyone in the community.

Most of the first paragraph is wrong, but the second paragraph is actually pretty close. The part it misses is that transactions are not considered safe to trust until they are 6+ blocks deep in the blockchain. But indeed, if someone out there is trusting them unconfirmed, you can defraud them this way as a miner.
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:57:21
There are 3 possibilities to avoid that:
* Centralised system (only has to fetch the data once)
* Include the data with the transaction (how Bitcoin handles it)
* zk-SNARK proofs (experimental, not implemented in a usable form yet)

It's been a while, but last time I looked it was displaying nonsensical "from addresses" (Bitcoin doesn't have such a thing) and its backups didn't include metadata (labels etc so you know who you paid and for what). These problems don't necessarily affect your security in ordinary use, but people who are misled about how bitcoin works can easily make mistakes that cause loss of bitcoins (eg, imagine trying to "return" bitcoins by sending them to that "from address"!), so I actually recommend against it in this case.

If you don't want to store it, don't. 100% of them were *immediately* prunable. And it's not like prayers are any more effort to store than if it had been random data instead. Unlike spam which increases the block size, those prayers did not.

Same as any atomic swap with altcoins or sidechains.
1. Joe sends his coins to "Fred's signature plus Joe's secret, or after N blocks, simply Joe's signature".
2. When that confirms, Fred then sends his coins to "Joe's signature plus Joe's secret, or after N/2 blocks, simply Fred's signature".
3. Joe claims Fred's coins, revealing the secret in the process.
4. Fred can now claim Joe's coins using the secret.

Presumably miners participating in BIP91 will reject blocks the fail to signal segwit (bit 1) after BIP91 activates. This implies they themselves will set bit 1.

There's also risks from using single ECDSA keys (paper or otherwise) due to address reuse. They're basically only safe if you ever send to them once at most (including not sending change back to them). If you're using them with any regularity, you're bound to screw up handling them properly (you'll lose one, or make one unsafely, or reuse one by accident, or forgot to save a new one, etc). If you're *not* using them with regularity, you're liable to forget an important step each time you do use it.

This isn't as scary as it sounds, and we've had plans for how to safely deal with this since before the article was written nearly **2 years ago** (but Vitalik has never followed Bitcoin development closely, so he didn't know).
You're only at risk if you misuse Bitcoin (eg, receiving with the same address multiple times), or quantum computers turn up without anyone noticing (which they would pretty fast if people started losing bitcoins). Otherwise, just stop using Bitcoin immediately when/if quantum computers become reality, until the network and yourself have both upgraded to a quantum-safe hardfork.
In any case, it's still unlikely that we'll see quantum computers before quantum-safe Bitcoin comes about via a (to-be) scheduled softfork.

You have it backward. Miners by nature have this "power" - it's their node doing the mining, after all. For policy decisions to be made by anyone else, miners have to choose to delegate it to them.

Security issues may be hashed out, but address reuse is *not a supported mode of use*, and only works at all by accident. Furthermore, you may lose your bitcoins irreversibly before they are hashed out.
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:11:51
No, it poses a (possibly small - but unknown probability) risk to your security, and harms the privacy of everyone using or holding bitcoins, especially those whom do business with you.
Additionally, when you reuse addresses, you have no way to know *who sent them*, so it makes you vulnerable to attacks where Bob claims to have sent the same payment Joe sent, and you can't tell which of them is lying.
And finally, you can do transparency just fine without address reuse.

Probably not much worse than Segwit itself, in terms of block size. But there are risks to hardforks that need to be addressed, and it must have consensus before deployment.

I think this misconception grew out of the HF'er trolls' FUD. They seem to have told their followers that segwit isn't a "real" block size increase, but merely reduces the size of transactons. Which is absolutely false: segwit increases the real block size and has the same size dynamics as a HF block size increase would.

Switch to a wallet that enforces it. BIP148 does *not* require a full node: even light clients can implement it since it only cares about the block header.
@_date: 2017-07-03 02:14:09
Worst case scenario would be:
1. Miners split the chain, and too many users embrace or concede control over Bitcoin to miners, such that the economic value of their invalid chain is higher than the economic value of the BIP148 chain.
2. In this case, SHA2 miners will likely defect to the miner-controlled Bitcoin to make more money, and the BIP148 chain will be abandoned by SHA2 miners.
3. Those of us who do not consent to a miner-controlled PayPal 2.0 cryptocurrency, will then remain with BIP148 regardless, and decide together on a hardfork to change the PoW algorithm to keep the blocks flowing.
4. Since the economic majority has in this scenario chosen to give miners complete control over Bitcoin proper, we will also need to come up with a new name, branding, etc for the decentralised cryptocurrency.
I would be quite surprised if the majority of the community decided to back a miner-controlled Bitcoin, though, so this is quite unlikely.

1. Raspberry Pi 1 (which this is based on) can only barely run a full node today, and probably can't reasonably bootstrap a new one.
2. Since it can only barely run a full node with under 1 MB blocks (on average), there is a good chance it won't be able to handle full 1 MB blocks.
3. Node operators don't really have a voice in hardforks, unless they are using the node to accept confirmed payment from untrusted third parties.
4. Since this can't really handle a hardfork increasing the block size limit, it can only be used to *oppose* any block size limit increases, not support them.

If someone has actually developed something new (obviously most scamcoins lack this, but let's pretend), it's reasonable for them to expect payment for their work. Disclosed premining is a very straightforward and honest way for them to do this.
The part about scamcoins that is *actually* a problem, is that unless they have long-term viability, they function as a zero-sum game: one persons' gains are anothers' losses. To top it off, most (all?) scamcoins make false claims to convince people they are a viable currency: things like pretending shorter block intervals make transactions faster, or that their new unreviewed PoW/PoS algorithm is "ASIC-proof" or more "fair", etc. As a result, people buy into the scamcoins under deceptive pretences, which makes the "price" of it essentially a fraud.

Segwit as designed would never activate without 95% miner support. If the community wishes to deploy it anyway, it is still possible to force the activation by having the supportive miners ignore non-segwit blocks.

It's no different than boycotting blocks which cause (unexpected) inflation, theft, wrong encoding of the block height, etc. They aren't valid blocks anymore. Most softforks have worked exactly this way; it's not even something new for BIP148.


If miners perform a 51% attack, they can split the chain. But that is true regardless of whether there is a UASF or not. Portraying it as something caused by the UASF is not very honest. The only way it would happen is if miners choose to attack in retaliation.


1. Core-signed is the wrong term. We have signed the BIP148 builds as well. You mean mainline Core releases.
2. That's only because of Core's negligence in merging this softfork in time.
3. Even then, it's only true if miners perform a 51% chain split attack on these no-longer-full nodes.


Status-quo is broken by the fact that BIP148 has been adopted by the community and is happening. If you fail to upgrade, you only put yourself at risk of attack from miners (same as with any softfork).

Ignore the trolls. Gentoo USE flags are not *supposed* to default to the reference code.
Gentoo now has the **most pro-freedom Bitcoin node distribution anywhere**. Not only can users easily choose to use improved spamfiltering or not (basic spamfiltering has been included in the reference code since before version 0.4), they can also choose from my functional patchset (including many of enhancements that others wouldn't get until 0.11), KDE integration, ZeroMQ support, Mike Hearn's Bitcoin XT patchset, child-pays-for-parent policy, as well as Peter Todd's data-carrier multi-push and/or replace-by-fee policies. This is in addition to the common/reference build options (generally *forced* on users of other operating systems) such as dbus support, QR Code support, UPnP support, wallet support, and a choice between Qt4 or Qt5. On top of all that, it even saves you disk space and memory by omitting support for languages you don't want (this is a global configuration in the OS). [Screenshot of all options](
(Also, it hasn't been trolled yet in this thread, but to preempt it: contrary to some trolls' lies, the improved spamfiltering is *not* censoring, nor blacklisting, and *never* forced; it also has nothing to do with morals, religion, or gambling).

No, it's not correct. It's really just a small handful of miners with disproportionately large hashrate VS everyone else, including almost all the users.
The small handful of miners wants to seize control of Bitcoin so they can prevent privacy and fungibility improvements later on. They fear their government (China) will crack down on Bitcoin if they can't trace it.
Almost everyone else thinks Bitcoin should remain decentralised, and probably in most cases support privacy/fungibility improvements.

Not necessarily! The UASF chain could very well reorg-overwrite the legacy chain with less than 50% hashrate, in which case the miners building the invalid blocks will  just re-split the chain all over again. This becomes less likely the longer the legacy chain survives without a wipeout, but it's entirely possible it could get replaced many times until it manages to get that lead.

It's not twisted, just correct. Almost every softfork has been deployed this way, and BIP148 does not behave any differently from them.

**Softfork**: backward-compatible protocol upgrade; old nodes rely on 51+% of miners to keep them secure.
**MASF**: Miner-Activated SoftFork. A softfork that delegates activation to miners by waiting for them to signal they are ready, to ensure old nodes don't split off.
**UASF**: User-Activated SoftFork. A softfork that does *not* delegate activation, typically based on a flag day.
**Hardfork**: backward-*IN*compatible protocol replacement. Requires consent and deployment by every single Bitcoin user, or it splits off into an altcoin.
**Block size**: The rate at which the blockchain grows. Larger increases the resource requirements to use Bitcoin, while also making it possible to mine more on-chain transactions per a given time period.
**Segwit**: Generally, a fix for malleability bugs. More specifically, BIP141 which also fixes some scaling bugs and bundles a block size increase to 2-4 MB.
**Lightning**: A protocol that uses Bitcoin smart contracts to provide an instant guarantee that transactions cannot be double-spent. (And therefore there is no rush to confirm them on-chain, so write caching becomes effective.)
**Lightning Network**: The p2p network of wallets upgraded to support the Lightning protocol.

There is more risk of disruption if we *don't* merge it, than if we do. And the personal risk of the user is much higher if he doesn't have it, too.

No, backwards compatible refers to the aim that in normal situations, old nodes will continue functioning (with reduced security). In the case of miners causing a chain split, they are specifically attacking that reduced security to interfere with the by-design backward compatibility.

No, actually, it will likely be much better.


With the current chain being broken in this scenario, there is certainty that everyone will hardfork. The only question is whether it will be to a miner-controlled chain, or to the PoW-changed chain. The latter is obviously preferable.


Status quo is not an option. BIP148 has widespread community support and is happening even if a minority decides to leave themselves vulnerable.

That stopped working a long time ago. Some miners (although their number dwindles) still honour priority, but you need to find a way to get your transaction relayed and accepted by them. So you need to pay at least *some* fee, even if below market rate.

Get something working and then start talking to miners about deploying it. As long as it's reasonable, you should be able to get Eligius and p2pool on board easily. Given time, you should be able to take advantage of merge-mining improvements for sidechains to get it mined the same way.

No, so long as miners do not behave maliciously by clearing bit 1, the chain will not split at all because of BIP148. So long as a majority hashrate have upgraded to BIP148, any invalid blocks will be rejected by the entire network quickly, almost just like orphan blocks.
Softforks are not a choice for miners, but for the community. Once the community supports it, miners have no choice but to upgrade. Refusal to do so is attacking the network, even without BIP148.

BIP 100 is not at 57% approval rate. There has been no vote, nor are hardforks open to voting (they need a consensus among all Bitcoin users).
Blocktrail is displaying information about what miners are including in their block format.

Orphan is indeed something/one without a parent. I've never heard of it to mean childless (which is usually "barren") outside of being confused with stale blocks in a Bitcoin context. Orphan blocks as such did actually occur subjectively in Bitcoin Core up until v0.11, although it avoids downloading any now.
Stale blocks are basically any valid block not part of the main chain. Admittedly, the term is not the best, so maybe "barren" would be better, but that only really makes sense in the context of the tip of a dead chain. In any case, "stale" is what everyone seems to be using who doesn't confuse them with "orphan blocks".


With first-seen policies, it's quite easy to manipulate what transactions miners see first, so it's certainly much better than 50%. RBF does improve this a bit, but still, a success rate of 0.25% (1-in-400) is not that bad, considering there is neither cost to failure, nor would the target ever know you tried. If it's a deposit account, you can just withdraw and continue trying.


But the probability of success is also 0% provided the recipient hasn't neglected to update their Bitcoin node, *or* requires a reasonable number of blocks before considering the transaction confirmed.


Specifically, they cannot be safely used to *receive* payments from *untrusted* third parties that are *expected to be irreversible*, without waiting *at least* a significant number of blocks and monitoring network conditions. For any significant volume, they *should not* be used to receive untrusted payments regardless.


Any? Probably. But it's not really even softforks that "degrade" the SPV wallets in this case, it's the negligent miners, and they could start mining invalid blocks without a softfork for the same effect.
But perhaps worth noting: hardforks degrade full nodes much more than SPV nodes are degraded by invalid blocks. And unlike SPV nodes, full nodes are supposed to be used for receiving payments.


No, I don't think this is a good reason at least.


Sure, as long as they're okay with possibly losing those bitcoins if someone double spends them. There's no real security in this use-case already, so there's nothing to keep in mind. Also, cell phones can use full nodes just fine: even though nobody has made a user-friendly full node for phone operating systems yet, many have made apps that use a trusted remote full node.


This doesn't seem any different from credit card disputes.

Weighed by capital *at risk*. The validators who were not at risk have little stake in which chain is honoured. The non-validators have a lot at risk since they depended on payments "confirmed" with invalid blocks. ~85% is an educated guess on the balance point where the valid chain is certain to prevail in a chain-wide dispute.
There are no fraud proofs (they are impossible), and light clients *cannot* notice anything suspicious.
Even in the best case scenario, we'd still need ~85% *capable* of running a full node in a timely manner, which means they either need to *already* be running, or the initial sync must be very short.
Whether it's "can run a node" or "do run a node", either way, resource requirements must be sufficiently low that ~85% are able to run a node.

There are many options, and we shouldn't decide until the last minute which one to use (to prevent anyone getting a head start on ASICs).


I would strongly advise against that. ASIC-resistance is what got us into the current mess.
ASIC resistance simply means making the ideal ASIC is harder, and therefore a monopoly once someone does it. For example, SHA256d with ASICBoost is an example of an ASIC-resistant algorithm - that's half the problem with our current situation.
Instead, what we should be aiming for is either a readily-available ASIC (eg, a truly memory-based algorithm, which doesn't exist to date), or at least an algorithm for which the best possible ASIC is simple and straightforward to produce, so it is easy to compete in the production of it (and therefore hard to monopolise).

The common assumption seems to be that it would be a fair playing field, but I'm not sure if that's true. It depends on the nature of the pre-hashing work - it could potentially favour bigger miners.
Keep in mind, ASICBoost makes SHA2 into an ASIC-resistant algorithm, so it would make the manufacturer monopoly stronger regardless of availability.
Since there wouldn't be an advantage to a specific entity, it is likely there would be less opposition to protocol upgrades that are incompatible with ASICBoost.

Today, you can probably get away with a single transaction spending all the UTXOs at once, but theoretically someone may someday run a relay node that grabs it, uses its signatures to derive the private key, then signs double-spends to himself which relay faster than your (large) transaction. Unfortunately, if you send to the keypair more than once, you're basically placing a bet on that not becoming possible before you want to redeem it.

What stops someone from creating an innovative new enhancement to Bitcoin, and secretly filing a patent on the code to implement it? (For example, let's say some way to make Bitcoin anonymous without any downsides.) They could then sue anyone running a node without paying them royalties, or even control the network by giving permission to run a node only to specific entities.
Yesterday, probably nothing would have stopped this. But with defensive patents, if they ever tried to do this, Blockstream (and anyone else who participates in the patent pledge) would have legal grounds to sue the attacker and put a stop to it.

Miner voting makes no sense whatsoever for hardforks in the first place. Miners are the least relevant group in deciding whether to adopt hardforking changes or not.


The problem isn't the enhancement itself, but the patent. Patents prevent their competition from independently discovering and using the optimisation. Secret optimisations cannot be patented. So even if the outcome is optimisations being kept secret, that's still an improvement.


This fix could only be done as a hardfork. And again, miners have no say in hardforks, and cannot prevent the community from adopting it (unless the miners also happen to represent a substantial part of the non-mining community, which is a very real possibility - but in that role it is in their favour to help decentralisation too).

Bitcoin wallets are, by definition, something which has a balance and can receive and send multiple Bitcoin transactions. A single ECDSA keypair cannot do that, since it can only be used to generate one (or at most, two) addresses, and each address is a single-use token. So to get a real wallet with private keys, you need *many of them*, which rapidly becomes beyond what a human can manage by hand.
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:30:23
There is no such thing as "segregating the witness". That's what an old hardfork idea did, and the name just stuck as it evolved. There is no "hard limit 1mb block" anymore.
It didn't require a hardfork because of the dual merkle trees. Pre-segwit nodes don't get to see the real block (it's hidden from them), and therefore can't enforce the 1 MB rule on them.

Indeed, a PoW change is very unlikely to be needed. But we should prepare now just in case it is. If it isn't, then it's ready early for November. If we don't need it in November either, then it's useful for a non-PoW-change hardfork in the future instead.

That's not correct. Softforks (including both BIP148 and BIP149) inherently require miners to upgrade to stay on the right chain. Neither BIP148 nor BIP149 does not force miners to support Segwit themselves.

Segwit fixes bugs, which enables smart contracts including real scaling solutions like Lightning. ~80%\* of the community support deploying Segwit as-is, and delegated the activation-button to miners in 2016 November. Bitmain has in the meantime become a mining monopoly, and is abusing this delegation as a way to block Segwit's activation and make ransom demands from the community.
BIP148 is a simple and straightforward solution: it removes the delegation to miners, and begins activation on a fixed date of August 1st instead.
\* The ~20% who don't support Segwit are only affected in one sense: the block size increase. But they also want a block size increase, so there is no rationale for blocking Segwit on these grounds.

1. This isn't a sane goal. Shares are inherently centralised by the nature of what they are. There is no value in managing them on a blockchain.
2. There is currently no standard for assets in Bitcoin. BIP 160 has been assigned for "Open Assets", but the spec is a work-in-progress.
3. Even once a spec is defined, it will still probably be a long way from being usable to most people.

It's pretty reasonable for the average person to want to entrust a third party with the security of their savings. Unfortunately, there is no competent organisation offering this today, and probably won't/can't be in the near future due to Bitcoin's unforgiveness of mistakes. If your USD bank gets compromised, they can hit "undo" and/or call on insurance - but if your bitcoin bank is compromised, good luck: no amount of insurance is likely to help.
Also, even if you choose to use one of these banks, it is still your money. You've just chosen to take *different* (and greater) risks of loss than trying to secure it yourself.

1) Yes, it is really true. With 4x as many blocks, difficulty (and thus security) will be 4x lower.
2) Helpful for what? (nothing... but can't refute an empty claim)
3) Bitcoin's blocks are only ~10 minutes apart on average, so there is some variance to be improved on by shorter block intervals - but this is countered by the higher stale block rate (which attackers do not suffer from).

What? The only thing between MtGox and Eligius were a couple of nothing-unusual contracts that were basically public knowledge (although not advertised - but nobody advertises every little contract they have). One where MtGox received remuneration in exchange for hosting services (that ended up not working out), and another where MtGox got their own transactions mined without fees in exchange for a referral link on their website (which MtGox didn't really follow through on). There was no "secret backdoor trading".

You're misunderstanding the distinction between block size and block size limit.
You're also misunderstanding the nature of the debate. The network *is incapable* of even 1 MB blocks today. Until that changes, trying to do 1 MB and larger blocks is directly harmful whether it is needed or not. So first we need to improve the network to handle at least 1 or 2 MB block sizes, *then* it makes sense to start producing larger blocks.

Bitcoin Core (as upstream/reference) operates as an open relay, except for transactions it deduces are spam. The spamfilter patch merely extends this logic to recognise common/notorious spam based on a signature of its script. Do you consider it censorship to not be an open relay?

There is. Block sizes really ought to be more like 650k these days.
@_date: 2019-05-28 02:55:58
Blocks aren't limited by size anymore. Instead, they are limited by an abstraction called "weight" (which are not a number of bytes). There can be a total of 4000000 "weight units" in each block.
Theoretically, a block can approach 4 MB in size before hitting this limit. But to do so, you would need to fill a block with signature data. Realistically, this means either a very complex smart contract or spam.
In practice, normal transactions can fill about 2 MB in block size before they hit the limit.
Since 2 MB is *technically* incorrect (since the strict limit is 4 MB), and 4 MB is disingenuous because it would only be spam, I tend to stick to "**2-4 MB**" to explain it in a single term (or simply "**2 MB**" when technical-correctness isn't needed).

A hardfork is essentially a fundamental change to the protocol that makes up Bitcoin, in a backward-incompatible way. It's technically identical to an altcoin, but the idea is that every Bitcoin user agrees to switch to it at a predetermined date, and it becomes the "new Bitcoin".
There's a niche who have convinced themselves Bitcoin needs more on-chain transactions today at any cost, and so they constantly push for such a hardfork to replace Bitcoin's 1 MB block size limit with a higher one (currently 2 MB, but it's no secret the end goal is 20 MB of more).
There are two problems with this:
1. Most of the community doesn't agree, and unless everyone switches, the hardfork attempt just becomes yet another altcoin. (Nobody can force everyone to switch, or Bitcoin is basically a centralised failure.)
2. The Bitcoin network today is not capable of handling even 1 MB blocks, and doing so has seriously compromised the project. As a result, Bitcoin today is extremely centralised, censorable, and dropping in actual users (people who run full nodes).

Light clients (which are not implementing SPV since it doesn't work) do not consciously make decisions about what nodes they are trusting. For all they know, perhaps every full node is a miner, or in collaboration with them. Even if they assume there are innocent nodes, they have no way to determine which those are.

Fractional reserve banking just means 1000 people give the bank 100 BTC, and the bank loans out 10 BTC. Nothing more. It's "fractional reserve" because they now only have 90 BTC themselves "in reserve" for when account holders make a withdrawl. And they can do that just fine with Bitcoin.

This is completely wrong.
The UTXO database does not change at all with Segwit (that's why it's a softfork).
The block format also does not change. (Note that the blockchain itself is NOT a database.)
The transaction format changes (optionally, per transaction) by moving signatures from the start to the end of the transaction:
Before: tx version, input-id 1, signature 1, input-id 2, signature 2, ..., output 1, output 2, ..., locktime
After: tx version, input-id 1, input-id 2, ..., output 1, output 2, ..., signature 1, signature 2, ... locktime

You should accept bitcoins directly, not through any third party. Run a full node and ensure payments confirm at least 8-10 blocks (1-2 hours) before considering them secure.
Ideally, you'd want to do a multisig escrow, but the infrastructure for this doesn't really exist yet (maybe you could implement it?).
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:45:18


Most nodes aren't miners. The financial interest of a node is to keep their own costs down, and keep the system as a whole functional. Bigger blocks increase the cost to run a node, and significantly harm the overall functioning of the system.
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:16:58
I don't agree. Even if you don't think it will have an economic majority, you still have fewer risks by switching to BIP 148. If there's a split, the legacy chain can be replaced by the BIP148 chain at any moment (even if the BIP148 chain is a minority).
The campaign will not be abandoned. If you want to avoid the middle, help push it up to majority.

This is incredibly unlikely.

It's comparing the first 5 bytes of the script, just like how the IsStandard filter compares various bytes of the script.

Last I checked, yes - they use it for malware protection.




Pretty sure it's not hardcoded, but I have never looked into how it is implemented.




Yes, in addition to the usual display of flags, it also gives a description of the policy configured both before and after the install.


Hm, that's not a bad idea... I didn't think of that. Maybe better would be a dialog displaying settings and asking you to set them there?


If the "ljr" USE flag is enabled, the Advanced tab of (runtime) Settings will let you manually enter such a list. It's much slower as a result of being a dynamic list, however. Also note, this was implemented by someone other than myself, so I may drop it in future patchsets since he has stopped maintaining it.








In the past, when these threads have popped up, I get more positive/supportive responses from people who seem to know the facts (how Gentoo works, what the patches do, etc), than negative ones.
But besides that, the primary factor should be whether most people, when they know the facts, would choose to enable it or not. This is something we can reason about, and it becomes IMO pretty clear what the answer is.

People demanding larger blocks now basically do not care if Bitcoin is centralised or decentralised. They just want to make a quick profit with price increases they think will magically come about from bigger block sizes.
The "smaller block" camp wants Bitcoin to succeed in the long term as a decentralised system, and therefore is working to make it actually scale without harming those values. So before we support larger blocks, we want to make the network capable of handling it in a decentralised manner.

The app UI seems pretty simple, but has a number of shortcomings (some serious).
It apparently always uses "bits", and doesn't have any configuration for other/sane units.
Transactions do not tell you what address they were received with, or let you set labels, so **there appears to be no way to tell who paid you or for what**.
Unconfirmed transactions show as a clock with a zero. The clock appears to stay the same, while the number counts up for each block deep it is confirmed. This seems to blur the distinction between unconfirmed transactions and confirmed (to varying degrees) ones. I think a different icon should be used for unconfirmed transactions, at least.
On the receive tab, there is a button to get a new address, but it is very unclear that is its purpose. It would be nice if it automatically made a new address every time you open the tab.
I had to login to the webapp to even try to set 2FA. It required me to confirm an email, but says the code expires after 5 minutes - but 5 minutes is the greylist time for my mail server... and for some reason it is using a new IP every time it tries to send, so it just repeats the greylisting over and over. Maybe if I keep clicking resend it will eventually get the same IP - but there's a rate limit, so that's slow. It's also using generic Amazon SES RDNS, so I can't just whitelist it either. In short, **I am unable to confirm my email**.
In the end, I decided there was no point to 2FA since I'm only going to be using the phone when I have no access to other devices. Unfortunately, there appears to be no way to turn off the warning without enabling it. Somewhat annoying.
While I was in the webapp, I accidentally clicked "Disable quick login on all devices". GreenBits showed a message along the lines of "Unfortunately, GreenBits has stopped" which I found a bit confusing, and no longer allows me to login with the PIN I had setup. After 3 failed attempts, it let me login with the mnemonic again. Logging in on the phone caused the webapp to log out.
Also while in the webapp, I noticed **it displays [misinformative "from addresses", which do not exist]( This is unexpectedly disappointing, and I hope it is fixed ASAP.

Regardless of BIP148, you should never keep your bitcoins with a third party. Get a full node and learn how to use it. Then keep your bitcoins in a wallet using that full node.
Poloniex has not announced how they plan to react if miners split the chain in August. For that reason also, you should make very certain you are not trusting them to keep your bitcoins safe for you. Once they announce a plan, you can evaluate (or read evaluations of) it and decide what to do next.

First of all, just to set things straight: No, we haven't. Until 2013, the block size limit was ~500k.
As we have approached and hit 1 MB blocks, we have watched as the network stopped working in a decentralised manner. Most people don't run their own full node anymore, and Bitcoin's security depends on ~85% or so running their own node. The only reason things work *at all*, is because of the efforts of developers (especially Pieter) optimising the code to adapt to the challenges of larger blocks. Even still, today, the situation is pretty dire even with 1 MB blocks.
If we had regular 1 MB blocks 8 years ago, Bitcoin would have just fallen apart completely.

The signatures are still part of the block.

There's nothing remotely like consensus for Segwit2x, and even if there was, it's still a hardfork and will still split the chain.
BIP148, on the other hand, is a softfork, doesn't split the chain, and has sufficient support.

Depends on the community support. If it's just the miners building a long invalid chain, and the community is simply coming to accept that old nodes must upgrade, then the UASF is still a success.
If the users on the legacy chain make a decision to stay on the legacy chain, then the UASF was a failure.
But in either of these scenarios, a PoW change is in order. If the UASF was a failure, we simply become an altcoin and need to find a new name. At least then it's &lt;new BIP148-based altcoin&gt; that survives long-term rather than Litecoin.

No, I didn't read it. And if that's what happens, then it's fundamentally flawed as an idea. Describing a behaviour as intended doesn't make that behaviour any less broken.


It's a problem even if the headers are entirely valid.


It's not clear if this refers to rejecting BMM headers from their own block, or rejecting others' blocks with invalid BMM headers. The latter would be harmful to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-17 22:50:45
If the validity of a block on the main chain depends on any given data, that data is mandatory for full node security, since by definition full nodes can deterministically tell on their own whether a block is valid or not. That's what full node security means.
The only way to make a sidechain optional to full nodes, is for miners to *not* enforce the peg rules against blocks violating them only due to external data.

Avoid others having physical access to the machine. If you're holding bitcoins for third-parties (ie, running an e-wallet service), I would consider a dedicated cage only a few known people have access to a must - don't trust any old person with access to the datacentre.
If possible, keep the wallet system(s) entirely offline and separate from the full node. For example, even if you need to regularly send bitcoins, you could keep most of the bitcoins in a cold wallet, and have the hot wallet only connect via a normally-disabled LAN connection every 10 minutes or so.

Extension blocks would be even more invasive than a softfork.

And no, extension blocks are far more complex and not something likely to be ready any time soon, whereas drivechains could potentially be this year.


On the contrary, sidechains (incl. drivechains) are entirely optional, and there is no reduction in security if you choose not to verify or use them.

If there is a chain split at all, you'd need to split the coins so you could sell on one chain and not the other.
The simplest way to do that *yourself* is to send them on the legacy chain with a lock time set to a block height that exists on that chain, but won't on the BIP148 chain for a while. And then double-spend it on the BIP148 chain. Now you have two distinct coins, one for each chain, that you can send however you need.
It's also probable you can just send the coins to an exchange and let them split it for you.

Litecoin, however, merely copies what Bitcoin does, so has no purpose - its existence is merely used as a tool to pump-and-dump it, redistributing money from the victims to the perpetrators.

Maintaining a given sync cost only makes sense if that cost is reasonable to begin with. In 3 years with the current growth rate, it certainly won't be.

I doubt it will ever get so low as to be mineable by GPUs, unless we're forced to go with a PoW change.

That's [part of] *why* they're fighting Segwit. Lightning doesn't need any additional changes beyond that.

Segwit2x does the same thing.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:45:05
It's changed numerous times.
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:10:06




It would need less than 15% of the current network hashrate (maybe even less, once difficulty adjustments are considered) to fail activating Segwit.

You're assuming 99.7% of miners are willing to make a long invalid chain (a 51+++% attack, aka "legacy chain") in the first place. In that extreme (and unlikely) scenario, a PoW change is the obvious course of action to move forward, whether or not they attack.
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:57:43
1. Make a backup (with the version you have now).
2. Shutdown the old version.
3. Wait several minutes to be sure it shuts down entirely (maybe check the task manager if you know how).
4. Uninstall the old version.
5. Install the new version.
6. Open the new version.
7. When things seem to have gone okay, you may wish to restart the new version once with the -upgradewallet option (this will reduce your transaction fees in the future, since it enables compressed keys).

That's not true. To get full node security, you *must* verify the extension block, even if you don't use it. That's the difference between an extension block and a normal sidechain.


Breaking the sidechain rules is enforced by miners on the sidechain only. The main chain will never be invalid because of what happens on the sidechain.
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:51:51
Backup PoW change is being prepared for the event they split off August 1st. We could use it in any later scenario as well.
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:59:11
By default, it does *NOT* enforce BIP148. But it does include the `-bip148` option (`bip148=1` in the config file) you can use to enable it.
This also enables a few additional features:
* 4 connection slots are reserved for BIP148 peers. (Currently this *only* works with Knots+BIP148, not Core+BIP148.) It *will* eventually give up if it can't find any.
* The user-agent string includes either `!BIP148` (BIP148 *not* enforced) or `+BIP148` (BIP148 enforced) in the UA comments. If the user does not choose, it is `!BIP148=`
* If the user enables `-bip148` after August 1, it will rewind any invalid blocks to ensure it correctly switches to the best BIP148 chain.

@_date: 2017-06-16 20:17:26
It sounded to me like if Segwit2x activates before BIP148 (and thereby neutralises it), they will support it, but if not, they are bailing out.
@_date: 2015-02-28 00:37:39
You mean *insecurely*. Paper ECDSA private keys are *not* a secure way to store bitcoins. Just because you haven't lost them yet doesn't mean they are secure or safe.
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:25:54
It sounds like they were reusing a single address/key. If you receive more than once with the same address, there are serious security risks. ECDSA isn't magic, it's math.
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:25:54
Because it's a security hazard and broken by design. The authors of blockchain.info don't know what they're doing or how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:30:01
If BIP148 were to fail, the alternative would result in Litecoin taking a lead over Bitcoin (already, there are Bitcoin devs defecting). For that reason, I would rather take the risk, and in the worst-case scenario turn BIP148 into an altcoin with a PoW change, so that BIP148-as-an-altcoin could be the altcoin (rather than Litecoin) that kills Bitcoin instead.
In the meantime, I will do my utmost to ensure that the risks of supporting BIP148 are kept to a minimum, and a chain split unlikely or at least quickly resolved, so that BIP148 is successful at upgrading Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:21:53
@_date: 2017-06-09 06:48:13
Depends on the current state at the time. Eg, if we're at 49%, cloudmining may be more useful.
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:01:52
To use Segwit you'll need to update to some Core version *quite some time after* August 1.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:18:08
Altcoins have Lightning. Lightning devs are defecting to them, and even some Bitcoin Core devs are defecting. That's to say nothing of users. Lightning is game-changing: it makes cryptocurrency *really* scale - low fees *and* small blocks. Why would anyone use, or develop, for a stagnant and centrally controlled Bitcoin, when there are much better options available?
Furthermore, if we miss the opportunity for BIP148, getting Segwit requires a *re-deployment* (regardless of whether MASF, UASF, or some new idea). This increases the complexity and risks significantly.
Finally, there is no benefit to waiting. It just gives Bitmain more time to exploit ASICBoost and grow in power.
P.S. And even if some people disagree these are good enough reasons, BIP148 is happening anyway, and failure to support it just puts you at more risk.

OpenSSL has a custom license that is very permissive, but requires any software using it to display (in the program itself) that the program uses OpenSSL and code by certain authors. This requirement is incompatible with the GPL and similar licenses which forbids adding any additional requirements.

Segwit and sidechains are unrelated issues.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:18:54
Miners cannot block softforks in the first place. The only reason they were able to block Segwit was the new BIP 9, which was intended to make softforks safer; the ability to block was a bug/exploit. That bug is fixed with BIP148, and will certainly be pre-fixed for any future softforks.
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:10:32
Yes, but if you spend them on one, you spend them on both, unless you take additional steps to split them first.

No, the softfork doesn't lead to a chain split.

Segwit does not reduce transaction sizes at all. The *only* way it increases capacity is the bundled block size limit increase. But even that won't make a real difference in transaction times or fees: *that* is solved by Lightning, which builds on top of Segwit.

Nothing harmful about BIP148 *itself*, but some miners have demonstrated malice and may decide to take the opportunity to try to cause a chain split (In fact, Jihan/Bitmain has already declared his intent to do so on Twitter.)
The only thing that can stop a chain split is widespread deployment of BIP148-enforcing code, such that an effort to split the chain proves futile and they either don't split the chain at all, stop forming the legacy chain, or finally go out of business.

There isn't time to do this before BIP148 becomes active. (Note that BIP148 cannot be cancelled.)


BIP148 makes Lightning possible. That's enough scaling to last us several years (decades?). I'd also be on-board for getting drivechains supported so miners can make as many big-block drivechains as they like without harming the main chain.

This is super-ironic considering that Segwit2x (which includes a hardfork) *guarantees* a chain-split, while BIP148 is a softfork and doesn't split the chain at all.

BIP148 does not depend on any specific percentage of users or nodes to activate. It is activating on August 1st regardless. Having more support just reduces the risk of miners attacking old nodes. But that support is measured in economic pressure, not node count.

Segwit is beginning activation no later than August 1st. Miners can split the chain at any time, regardless of Segwit/BIP148.

Why are you feeding this FUD? I have actually done relatively little to keep blocks small - only improved education and awareness in the Bitcoin community. And blocks sizes *really do* need to be addressed somehow, as the current pace is very harmful to Bitcoin. Compromise has been tried, and tbh I think I may be among the most open-minded in this area.
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:33:44
Segwit is just as immutable as the rest of Bitcoin. More immutable, actually, since it fixes the unintended-malleability bug.
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:13:53
Yes. But *just* a softfork.
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:32:13
Bitcoin was never intended to be anonymous. It's not even a goal of the development community. There is nothing today that offers the security Bitcoin provides at the same speed. And again, nothing stops Bitcoin from adopting the mechanisms of these other networks - it isn't limited to just the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:25:43


No, all softforks are and always have been user-enforced. The earlier ones were also user-activated (UASFs). Miners merely protect non-full/insecure nodes (only). To make softforks safer, beginning in 2013, the development team decided to implement softforks to wait for their cue that they were prepared to defend non-full nodes, before activation. BIP 34 (2013 March) was the first MASF. Due to miner screwups with MASFs, in 2016 we decided to increase the signalling threshold to 95% in hopes of making MASFs safer. Instead, miners have abused it to hold Segwit hostage. MASFs therefore have proven to be a failure of an experiment, and it's time to go back to UASFs.


UASFs do not split Bitcoin in two. A chain split only happens if *miners* cause it. They can cause it with or without BIP148. If the chain splits on August 1st, it will be because miners have chosen to use BIP148 *as an excuse* to split the chain, not because of anything BIP148 itself actually caused.


Almost everyone does, and as a softfork, it requires only broad support, not unanimous consensus.




No, it is and always has been by design that miners *do not* have control. If you wanted a centrally-controlled currency, I suggest looking at USD.

Considering miners control drivechains, it makes no sense to do this as anything except a MASF.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:23:54
BIP148 does not cause a chain split at all. The only risk of a chain split is if the miners decide to do one. They can do that at any time - with or without BIP148 - so if they blame it on BIP148, it is literally nothing more than an excuse. This chain split, if miners go forward with it, is an attack on non-full (including old) nodes.
With a majority of miner support, Bitcoin/BIP148 will withstand any such an attack. The chain won't split, and everything will move on as normal.
If a majority of miners decide to participate in the 51% attack, BIP148 can still succeed: so long as a majority of the economy upgrades their nodes in time, the attack will be ineffective, miners will quickly learn their invalid blocks are worthless, and adapt by ending the chain split and coming back to the main (BIP148) chain. Even if they don't, the rest of the community can simply upgrade to get off the miner's forked chain.

BIP148 does *not* create a new chain. It does not cause a chain split. It simply adds a new rule, like every softfork before it.
Miners might split the chain by mining invalid blocks and *blame* BIP148, but that doesn't change the nature of BIP148 itself, and it would require 51+% to attack the network for their chain split to survive.
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:38:23
Yes, every UASF ever has succeeded, including Segwit (on altcoins) and other softforks on Bitcoin. BIP148 has broad community support, and enough to succeed as well.

Segwit2x would just have the same outcome, and turn into an altcoin.
There's no real downside to BIP148.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:03:42
1. Segwit2x is a HF to 8 MB, not 2 MB.
2. Blunt hardforks (such as in Segwit2x) *always* split the chain.
3. There is *not* a strong consensus for Segwit2x, even among miners and exchanges.
4. Neither miners nor exchanges can force a hardfork. To succeed, virtually *everyone* must consent.
5. Most miners building on a hardforking chain is not sufficient to avoid a chain split. This only works with a softfork.

If there are a majority of BIP148 miners, no chain split occurs at all. It is only if a majority ignore BIP148 (which is *not* clear, and even unlikely) that a chain split occurs. And in that case, it is those miners who are causing the chain split by failure to enforce the network's rules.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:21:12

* Full node percentage is at an all-time low, far under a safe percentage of 85%. If you ask people why they don't run a node, the reason is often tied to the block size.
* Miners are de facto cheating by skipping the very validation that is a crucial part of their job. This breaks the little security light clients had. The cause for this is the time it takes to verify large blocks.
* Mining requires membership in a centralised backbone (relay networks) in order to not take huge losses due to stale rate as large blocks take time to cross the p2p network. Centralised backbones like this are inherently not permissionless, and can be censored.

There is no increased risk of persistent chain split from a UASF. Softforks (incl UASFs) have a minimal risk only if miners behave maliciously.


A hardfork is a protocol replacement that requires all users to adopt it in order to succeed, because old nodes will never accept the new blocks as valid.
A persistent chain split is a branch in the blockchain that never resolves back to a single chain.
A contentious hardfork guarantees a persistent chain split, whereas a softfork (whether deployed via MASF or UASF) will resolve to a single chain so long as a supermajority of the economy supports it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:26:13


But that's wrong. Even if all the miners comply with a hardfork, the old nodes will *still* reject it; and it only takes a tiny minority of the miners (such as an attacker who managed to break into one small miner's system) to cause a chain split.
With a UASF, you need 51+% of miners to cause the chain split.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:33:45


More likely than the original chain without segwit surviving.


The only way to do that is to make sure BIP148 is a success. If BIP148 fails, there *will* be a chain split, period.

Core's monopoly is a problem, so the effect of breaking that monopoly is a good thing.
The losses would be unfortunate, but at the end of the day, they are partly responsible for their own negligence; the only other responsible parties would be the miners who gave them an invalid chain fooling their insecure nodes. The most we can do is try to reduce the risk for them by deploying BIP148 as widely as possible and strongly discouraging miners from attacking them.

Things *should* just continue working as usual, but there is suspicion that miners will seize the opportunity to split the chain and blame BIP148 for it. If that happens, then there will be two chains: a "legacy" chain that is a 51% attack, and the main chain that enforces the BIP148 rule. To make sure you are on the main chain, you need to run or at least use a node that is enforcing BIP148.

Bitcoin Core currently consists of quite a few things:
* The actual consensus protocol itself. Here, upgrades like Segwit are implemented, syncing optimisations are done, etc.
* The p2p flood network layer. This includes a mempool, compact block relay, transaction relay, etc.
* The reference wallet. Lots of work to be done here... we need better HD wallet support, a hardware wallet abstraction layer, better fee estimation and bumping, etc.
* JSON-RPC service.
* ZMQ service.
Additionally, there is active work to improve tests, which sometimes exposes bugs to get fixed.

No, I am talking about BIP141/Segwit (which bundles a 2-4 MB block size increase already).


Third-party malleability deals with the transaction-id changing when someone other than the sender modifies the signature. Old transactions calculate the transaction-id by simply hashing the entire transaction. Segwit transactions calculate the transaction-id by skipping over the signatures while hashing the transaction.

@_date: 2017-06-03 18:25:29


BIP148 itself does *not* cause a chain split. There will *only* be two branches if 51+% of miners maliciously attack the network by mining a longer invalid chain that is accepted by non-upgraded nodes.


Define "clean" and describe why you think this attribute is necessary.


This doesn't make sense. Addresses are only used to receive, not send. If a UTXO exists only on the legacy chain, then it is impossible for a transaction spending it to get mined in a BIP148 block. If you are using the BIP148 chain to receive, such a payment would be entirely invalid to you. You wouldn't see it unconfirmed, nor would it ever confirm. Essentially, the legacy chain doesn't exist from the POV of people who upgrade to BIP148. The BIP148 user does not lose money, because he never accepted the invalid payment in the first place.
(There are also no circumstances where the BIP148 chain will die off.)


This is not the best-case scenario, not by far. The *expected* scenario, is that *most* miners will comply with BIP148 within a month, and things continue as usual. A better scenario is that all miners enforce BIP148 before August. The *best*-case scenario is that miners simply activate Segwit before August, and BIP148 has no effect at all.


The only thing "delusional" is the idea that once most miners realise a chain split has decimated their earnings, that they will continue on that path.


Replay isn't as bad as you think. It's essentially the same as sending pre-split bitcoins today. I can think of only a few real reasons to actively *prevent* replay:
1. To take a definite side in a chain split.
2. If you intend to send the same bitcoins you received. In this case, you should really be using the received UTXO as an input to prevent other attacks anyway, and this also keeps you safe from replay-related issues.
An ordinary, neutral user, who is simply hodling, sending payments, or being paid for good or services, really ought to desire their payment be confirmed on all possible chains (ie, both legacy *and* BIP148), and toward that end, "replays" actually help.
Anyhow, to split coins is fairly simple.
For example:
1. Shortly after miners split the chain, there will be a BIP148 chain with X blocks, and a legacy chain with X+6 blocks (if it's not at *least* 6 blocks longer, it's hardly safe to call it a chain at all).
2. You want to split coins with UTXO id 'A'.
3. First, you generate two new addresses, one for each chain. We'll call these AddressLegacy and Address148.
4. Send UTXO id 'A' to AddressLegacy, with a lock time of X+3 and sufficient fee to be confirmed *eventually* (not necessarily the next 3 blocks, although you *will* need to wait for it to confirm to move beyond step 7).
5. Wait a few minutes to ensure this transaction propagates to all the miners producing the legacy chain.
6. Send UTXO id 'B' to Address148, with a lock time of X, and a sufficient fee to be confirmed eventually.
7. Wait for both your transactions to confirm (give it at least 32 blocks) on their respective chains.
8. If miners on both chains mine the same one, go back to step 3 and try again.
9. You now have two different UTXOs, one exclusively on each chain. We'll call these UTXOLegacy-A and UTXO148-A.
10. Use UTXO&lt;chain&gt;-A as an input to prevent replay on &lt;other-chain&gt;. This will destroy UTXO&lt;chain&gt;-A, so make sure you create a change output to serve as your new UTXO&lt;chain&gt;-B.
11. Funds sent in this manner are valid only on one chain, *and* can be used as chain-splitting inputs! You can *share* your chain-splitting capabilities with others by simply sending them funds in this manner.
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:51:17

Not quite. Core has 0.14.0, 0.14.1, and 0.14.2, all without BIP148 unfortunately.
To get BIP148, you need either Core+BIP148 (which is Core with *only* BIP148 added, and not by me), or Knots (which is the one I maintain) with the `-bip148` option enabled. Core+BIP148 has a 0.14.1 and 0.14.2 release. Knots has all the versions, but only the 0.14.2 one supports `-bip148`.

First, understand that for HD wallets, the private key is the seed for the entire wallet. The ECDSA keys used for individual addresses in the wallet are merely calculated from the seed, and if you give someone the ECDSA private key of one of those, you will be giving away the entire wallet, not just the funds received with that address.
Now with that important detail clarified: It's secure for the sender, but not for the receiver (because the sender still has the private key).
It's also important to note that you need to actually use PGP securely for this to work. If you never verified the public PGP key fingerprint of your recipient in person, for all you know, you may have a MITM'd key.

2. As a result of 1, doing this would more likely reduce Knots users, vs improve BIP148 enforcement.
3. Knots is small enough that probably everyone using it can figure out how to enable it with the option anyway.
If theymos would just give the go-ahead or at least a "I will allow it to remain", I'd probably make it the default.

BIP148 doesn't split the chain. Miners do (or don't do) that. And people failing to enforce BIP148 just enables them. Miners are the minority, not users.

Sidechains are optional, and have different security tradeoffs. Extension blocks are mandatory for full nodes, and basically have no meaningful purpose unless they're using a fundamentally different paradigm than the main chain.

BIP148 is in 2 months (August 1st) and is compatible with all existing Segwit-enabled nodes; and BIP149 is a fallback plan in case BIP148 fails which would occur at the earliest summer 2018 (but more likely 2019 or 2020), but is incompatible with current nodes, and more complicated due to having to re-deploy Segwit entirely.

Litecoin proponents regularly try to promote it as viable, despite the "designed to fail" attribute from the scrypt POW, and they also promote it as ASIC-resistant (originally GPU-resistant) despite the fact that it is not.

Segwit/BIP148 is a softfork, and entirely optional (BIP148 just prohibits miners from blocking others from using it). It succeeds so long as a majority of the economy OR a majority of mining hashrate supports it. It has widespread support in the Bitcoin community.
Segwit2x is a proposed hardfork attempt, which means every single user must upgrade for it to succeed. It has support from a relatively short list of startup corporations, most of which are owned or bribed in some way by an even smaller list of corporations. There is little support for it from the wider community.

Right now, Bitcoin is centralised and mining requires participating in a centralised "block relay network" which could very well begin censoring at government demand. For Bitcoin to function as a decentralised system, blocks need to pass from anonymous miner to anonymous miner over the standard peer-to-peer block relay network, which is inherently slower than centralised networks.
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:59:38
Hypothetically, there are (besides drivechains):
* Federated sidechains, where functionaries control pegged funds in a multisig.
* SPV-pegged sidechains, where the main chain verifies SPV proofs; requires a softfork.
* SNARK-pegged sidechains, where the main chain verifies SNARK proofs; requires a softfork.
Both SPV- and SNARK-pegged sidechains rely on reorg proofs, however, which the main chain miners can censor. So the only miner-proof system is federated sidechains.

No, while not a perfect success, this does not in any sense indicate the UASF has failed!


Yep, that's part of the plan.


The legacy chain isn't really a proper chain per se - it's a 51% attack against old nodes. As soon as the honest (BIP148) miners overcome it, the attack fails. That's by design.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:02:59
There are a few outcomes possible in that respect:
1. Majority of miners are honest. Everything just works fine.
2. Substantial minority of miners are honest. Old nodes are vulnerable to 51% chain split attack from the malicious miners, and need to upgrade to BIP148 to protect themselves.
3. Almost no miners are honest. In this situation, a PoW change is in order. Emergency code is currently being prepared for this just in case.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:38:51
Considering invalid chains as valid means you're not a full node.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:18:19
That's when the latest upgrade to Bitcoin (Segwit) is scheduled to begin activation. Some malicious miners are making threats to split the chain in response, so there's a risk if you don't upgrade your full node to a BIP148 version before then.

Even parent-to-child transfers are cumbersome, so when possible you would want to do a cross-chain exchange rather than use sidechain pegging.
You can of course withdraw from one sidechain and at the same time send to another on the parent chain.
As far as sending *directly* from a sidechain to another sidechain, that depends on the target sidechain. There are security implications in accepting such a transfer - for example, the sending sidechain could be compromised or even intentionally malicious.

No, it doesn't. Just because the UTXO created when I received at 1someaddress is still unspent, doesn't mean those funds are still mine. Consider the shared wallet scenario, where Joe, Bob, and Mary all use the same wallet. Joe receives 1 BTC at 1abc, Bob receives 0.5 BTC at 1def, and Mary receives 2 BTC at 1ghi. The wallet now has 3 UTXOs: 0.5 BTC, 1 BTC, and 2 BTC. If Joe sends 0.5 BTC to Fred, the wallet *should* use the 0.5 BTC UTXO as the input. Your voting app will still think Joe has 1 BTC, when he really has 0.5 BTC.

Personally, I was expecting to see all the settings in the app settings dialog.


Well, it does make sense to have the default be "bits" for an app named GreenBits.. I don't particularly like "bits", but that's obviously subjective, and IMO no basis for arguing over defaults. Obviously I would prefer if TBC support were also there. :)


Eh, then they should probably be renamed to subwallets? "Accounts" are supposed to transparently share outputs within a wallet (and, IMO, more desirable than subwallets).




How about a question mark for unconfirmed? Point is to convey that there is no security for the transaction yet. Maybe a colour change makes sense for an arbitrary block count? Eg, change from red to black at a 6-blocks-deep confirmation?


Sure. I do like how Bitcoin Core encourages the good habit of labelling new addresses by asking for a label prior to giving the address for it - but that might be harder when your userbase mostly lacks usable keyboards :(

What you're talking about is a 51% attack. Softforks are enforced by *users*, not just miners. (Also, extension blocks aren't softforks, but that's beside the point.)

@_date: 2016-07-03 23:11:01
Yes, propagation time across the entire network needs to be well under 30 seconds for the p2p network to compete with centralised networks. For this, the average node needs to be capable of downloading, verifying, and uploading the block to 8 peers in maybe 4 or 5 seconds. Typical upload speeds are simply not good enough for this today.
Compact block relay in 0.13 will hopefully improve it by using the local memory pool as a cache for transactions in blocks. So instead of downloading/uploading the full block, you can get away with only a few transactions the receiving node didn't cache (the rest cached during non-time-critical periods preceding the block being found). Essentially this brings the time constraint from 5 seconds to 8 or 9 minutes on average.

BIP148 adds a rule to Bitcoin, that miners must set a bit in the block header. So long as miners comply with the rules (this one as well as others), the chain never splits. So the only way a chain split occurs in August, is if 51+% of miners refuse to follow the rules and create a bunch of invalid blocks that old nodes accept (because they're ignorant of the new rule).
Essentially, not-enforcing-BIP148 is a contentious hardfork attempt, and *that* (not BIP148 itself) is what would cause the chain split.

It's *not* working. Full node percentage is severely low (under 50%); miners are cheating on validation; mining effectively requires using centralised and censorable relay networks; decentralised mining is impractical; etc.

@_date: 2017-06-04 20:42:28
That's not true. Hardforks guarantee a chain split with anything less than 100% consent from every single Bitcoin user. The only way to prevent it, is for miners to reject the hardfork.
In the case of softforks like BIP148, the only way to prevent it, is for miners to *comply* with the softfork.

Assuming a 1 MB tx size limit, the risk would be the same as today (which is already quite bad). IIRC, to make it reasonable, the limit would need to be absurdly low.


Yes, I note that adding a tx size limit would be required for any viable block size increasing hardfork.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:59:29
No change. Segwit is still a block size increase, but increasing block sizes doesn't matter much to fees. On-chain fees are set by spammers. The only way to effectively reduce them is to use less on-chain data.

* Community support for Segwit2x is virtually non-existent.
* Hashrate is irrelevant to hardforks.
* Unweighed node support matters little.

FUD. It was simply improved spam filters, not blacklisting, and the only problem was that it was under-documented.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:44:15
Softforks reduce the security of old nodes. Miners can then exploit that to attack those old nodes. BIP148 is Segwit, and as such, there is a risk anti-Segwit miners may take the opportunity to attack the old nodes.
But if you're not receiving after July, you're unaffected.

No, I won't put my name on a bad idea that is likely to destroy Bitcoin. If the community wants to do something like that, they can do it without me.
Note also that hardforks require unanimous agreement, not merely a supermajority. This is a *technical requirement*, not an arbitrary rule. There is also zero value in having it miner-activated.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:41:50
It doesn't. Segwit does not in any way reduce the sizes of transactions. Moving them all to the same place, however, allows them to be stripped out of the transaction when calculating the transaction id, and this is how Segwit avoids malleability.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:43:16
Note the prayers were not part of block headers, they were in the (immediately prunable) part of transactions specifically reserved for brief notes like that. There were also many other non-prayer inserts, and requesting these is a feature of the Eligius pool. Originally, this was done as a test for code that is used for merged mining.
Also note that while I personally shutdown some *scamcoins* (not legitimate altcoins), contrary to the claims of various trolls, Eligius miners were not involved in it.
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:07:41




Apples to apples, please. Every block is not 1 MB with a 1 MB limit.


They don't have to, no. They're only "losing out" from a strictly profit perspective. That mining has profits at all is a *bug*.

Core does want BIP148, because it *reduces* the risk of a chain split. The only reason it's not merged and part of a Core release is because a *few* Core devs oppose merging it.

Unless you're running Core**+BIP148**, you won't be safe beginning in August. However, everyone is affected and carries *some* risk in the event miners perform a chain split attack in August.

Yep, that's how softforks work.


The mechanism is fundamentally different, and the only distinction between a sidechain and extension block.
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:08:13




Coins mined on BIP148's chain will be more valuable. Every single past UASF (including Segwit UASFs) has resulted in miners complying prior to the activation date.


A mining pool once tried that before, out of negligence. It was called Deepbit.


There won't be fees on an abandoned chain. Not only do they need to consider possible price improvement when BIP148 succeeds, they also need to consider the price on any legacy chain crashing as demand disappears.


You have it backward. Segwit support is the majority. The miners are the minority.

It would be undetectable until some miner tried to exploit the tampered snapshot. At that point, you would accept the invalid block, while those with untampered nodes would reject it.

Addresses should never be reused, period. Any client that does this is harmful to Bitcoin. Furthermore, there is no "sending" address - you're depending on a coincidence with how Bitcoin-Qt *currently* forms transactions; one which isn't likely to remain the same as Bitcoin develops more.

If your client fails to enforce BIP148, then it's vulnerable to a chain split attack from malicious miners, if they get majority hashrate. In this case, you could see phony transactions get "confirmed". Without a full node, you're always vulnerable to attacks like this anyway, but there's a perception that miners are more likely to try something in August.
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:12:25

It'd be a hardfork, which means the community needs to come to unanimous consensus on it.

No, Bitcoin's blockchain was never intended to support flooding attacks. It was designed to block such attacks by utilitizing presumed-good humans (miners).
It is true that eventually, sites should be able to do similar-in-appearance behaviours, but this is still a ways off and requires making use of the improvements (such as the upcoming payment protocol, and still-in-conceptual-design off-blockchain transactions). And SatoshiDice explicitly refuses to use any of the improvements already made (key compression, for example) to reduce the impact of their flooding.

No, you need to actually use the anti-replay logic to avoid it. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a softfork. (Also, replay isn't always an attack; it's no different than sending coins prior to the chain split, which is desirable to any neutral hodler.)

That is a contradiction in terms. Mining invalid blocks is *inherently malicious*. And even today, mining blocks that don't signal segwit is malicious since it has widespread community support.
And this isn't caused by BIP148 in any case, it is caused by the miners who are producing a long chain of invalid blocks. They can do it just as easily with or without BIP148.

5 of us prefer it as the best solution. 5 more just support it. 4 more support it, but want to see more community support. That's a total of 14, or 58% of the listed 24 developers.  As a bonus, Nicolas Dorier considers himself under the "Deficient" category, yet clearly promotes people and companies run BIP148.

Yes, but unfortunately the non-US world is more oppressive to the degree I am unwilling to risk moving there just for Bitcoin.

Because majority is insufficient for a hardfork.
A hardfork is by definition a new altcoin/protocol which carries balances over from Bitcoin, and aspires to replace the current protocol as the new Bitcoin. The current protocol itself sees and reacts to it as just an attack to be ignored. Unless everyone switches to the new protocol, the current Bitcoin will continue just fine, and the new protocol will simply become yet another new altcoin (perhaps with a large userbase).

You're buying into Kano's lies. Before I reworked the code, cgminer was just a CPU miner with a GPU miner tacked on in indepedent code. The entire abstraction making other drivers, and the work needed to support FPGAs, were done by me.
In reality, until long after I brought FPGAs to the codebase, Kano's contributions were mostly just the RPC API interface. Since he and Con had their coup and decided to stop collaboration, they have only made the FPGA support worse, and introduced ASIC support with mostly the same problems.

Bad analogy. A temporary 51% DoS on Bitcoin would perhaps be mostly ineffective in destroying value, but obviously the issue at hand is a sustained one.
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:52:07
You don't need 51% to attack bitcoin! Just 36% is sufficient to succeed reversing 6-deep confirmed transactions with a 1-in-3 chance of success. Even if you trust your pool operator not to try it, most people won't even notice until it's successful, and this makes the pool a *huge* potential target for crackers and other criminals (the weak link might not be the server's security!).
Push for more pools to support [decentralized mining]( so miners can audit blocks for attacks in realtime and stop them *before* they happen.

Nope. The chips force a generated output to 21inc, which no mining pools allow.

They don't seem to be ignoring the cost - it's included in their algorithm.
If there are 4 miners mining this same way, they end up with the same end revenue as if none of them had done it, except the network would see a lot more reorganisations, and probably need more blocks to confirm transactions safely. Not to mention the lost work toward securing it.
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:12:53
They certainly *can* tax it. Whether they choose to or not is another matter.

This transaction is built on top of a chain of about 30 other unconfirmed transactions, which appear to be "change". The whole stack of transactions is stuck waiting for 0743aa0cf0241c41... to confirm:
This transaction is only paying a 0.0005 BTC fee for 1191 bytes; the "standard" fee rate for such a transaction is 0.001 BTC (since it's 1-2 KB).
That being said, it does meet Eligius's reduced fee rates and all of the transactions in this chain are currently slated for the pool's next block. It just means a bit of a delay, in the end, as long as Eligius is finding blocks.

This is only a problem because of flooding attacks like SatoshiDice. Encourage more miners to filter this crap, and you'll find the rest of the system functions just fine.
