This is completely misleading and obviously misses the point. 
Of course the dot-com bubble didn't destroy the internet, of course some companies survived and began to thrive again. The point is that it put a LOT of huge companies out of business, and lots of investors lost their money. 
Hell, look at all the companies thriving now! The wall street crash wasn't *that bad* was it? ^/s

Christ, do you know something we don't? I've been bullish on BTC for a while but wouldn't dump anywhere near that much into it until I see how BTC reacts to the alt market over the next few months

Insightful.

Humble brag

You have absolutely no idea what's going to happen mate

This is a stupid philosophy and will likely bite you in the back one day. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:52:17
For something which has been around for 8 years? No where near enough data to make even a reasonable guess, especially with (better) gaining traction recently - it's all up in the air.

Ripple straight killing the game

Why are people sending coins here?

Jesus, how much profit did he end up making?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:14:22
They literally are though.

What program are you using?
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:50:34
10k by the end of this working week.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:56:58
Fuck off you sarcastic cunt. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:19:13
Which ass are you pulling those figures from?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:28:54
Only if you're cashing out.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:40:55
Not really. I don't think I'm better than anyone here, just looking to have an actual chat about bitcoin rather than scroll through hundreds of identical memes. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:58:10
I could see that for sure. I've been all about HODL but envisioning a pretty large drop here. Toying with the idea of selling now and buying back later. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:19:00
Best time to buy was yesterday - second best time is today, or whatever cliche line you want to use.
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:04:04
Very, very bad idea.
Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:01:41
How is this a stupid post? I mean obviously I'm not the only one who thinks this, I was just trying to guage levels. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:14:51
UK right? 
What did you use to purchase it? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:22:50
I must have. I live in the UK so it will have happened when I was asleep, and had no idea it had hit 10k until a few people pointed it out in this thread. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:50:29
Supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:43:03
I may be wrong, but isn't it incredibly financially irresponsible to use bitcoin as a currency at this point? As long as it's in such a wild upswing, that four pounds you spend on breakfast daily has probably amounted to tens of thousands in lost profits over the years.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:17:12
Hi Molly, what is the maximum amount that can be purchased?
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:33:56
I'm sure multinational bankers also make memes of bitcoin investors shitting on the floor too.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:25:35
Hahahaha you've got to be kidding, by that metric BTC is orders of magnitude more popular than USD or GBP.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:46:33
People have spent lifetimes trying to figure this shit out. Best you can do is rough estimate based on previous trends, but that's not a great way to invest in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:57:25
one of the greatest replies I've ever seen
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:48:07
My point was that it's a currency, and you don't measure the adoption rate of a currency by how many people subscribe to it's subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:06:19
You can fuck right off.
