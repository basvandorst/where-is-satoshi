The crucial matter with fractional reserve banking (FRB) is legal tender.
In a free market (i.e. a market free from legal tender laws), FR banks must keep a reserve ratio compatible with what the market expects. If they don't, they fail - people simply stop accepting their paper money, because they know it is worthless as it is not actually backed by bullion.
Once legal tender kicks in, people are forced (literally) to accept that worthless paper. This allows banks to lower their reserves to insane levels, enriching themselves in the process - they create new money but pay old prices.
The way I see it, bitcoin FRB would have to operate off-blockchain (as mining is the *only* way bitcoins can ever be created, and lending is *not* mining). This would immediately be a red flag for sensible agents, limiting the harm FRB could cause.
In short, I think Bitcoin offers a reasonable level of protection against FRB.

I refer to most states, except the lucky few without central banks (e.g. Panama).
I admit my post wasn't crystal clear, but I was supposing the OP and you knew what the next step has historically been in the evolution of currency.
First, you have bullion as currency. Then, you have coinage. The state monopolizes coinage, because it sees this allows it to debase the currency to its own benefit. This happened in ancient times, beginning in Lydia at some point of the first (?) millennium before the current era, and I'm a bit too lazy to Google the exact point.
Afterwards, people realize carrying metal is clumsy, so banks arise: places where bullion is stored in exchange for a certificate, which then begins to be used as a substitute for money.
As long as the market is free (other than that state intervention which is the debasement of coinage), banks must operate at a reserve ratio the market accepts. (I [mentioned]( this on a side thread).
Then comes central banking: since legal tender laws have allowed banks to create money like there is no tomorrow, on the false pretense it is backed by bullion, there is the occasional, recurring need to bail out banks. Besides, the state wants in on the massive transfer of wealth fractional reserve banking operates towards those allowed to create money.
A central bank allows the state to accomplish both these objectives (bail out banks and get its share of the wealth transfer). So, in the US, for example, the Federal Reserve system was created in 1913.
People could still protect themselves from the debasement of currency through money creation by the Fed by using gold. This is why Herr F. Roosevelt confiscated everyone's gold about a month into his presitatorship. Gold remained illegal for private individuals in the US to hold until after the final step of this process: the end of convertibility of dollars into gold in 1971.
Since people had already conformed to money having no real value other than that the government decreed it to have, there was no point in even pretending it was actually backed by bullion. (What's the point of a gold standard system if you are forbidden from converting your bills into bullion, unless, like in the Bretton Woods system, you're a foreign power?) So the government simply said - dollars aren't backed by gold anymore. You still have to accept them, or else...
In short, every fiat currency in the world is "backed" by the threat of your debtors being legally allowed to default on their debt should you refuse to accept payment in that specific kind of colorful paper. Other nations' legal tender laws are even harsher than America's - you're not allowed to refuse their decreed colorful paper even if there is no outstanding debt - you cannot legally operate a bitcoin-only business, as you are in America.
In short, the state forces people to accept paper without any relation whatsoever with real value, like I said in my previous post.

People had lost trust in the government to do that. It had been done many times before. The real gave people a perception that "this time it's different".
Previously, when we changed currencies, we'd just cut out three zeroes out of everything, including banknotes of the former currency - all of a sudden a banknote for 10,000 Whatevers would show up with a stamp saying its value was now 10 New Whatevers.
The real was different. We didn't know the exact conversion value between the cruzeiro and the real until the eve of the changeover, and we didn't need to, because we knew 1 URV would become 1 real - the only doubt was how much cruzeiros 1 URV would be. It ended up being 2,750 cruzeiros to the real.
Also, unlike the previous plans, entirely new banknotes were introduced. Although they retained design elements from previous denominations, much of their design was done from scratch. This helped create a sense of identification and care between the people and this new money, which had been lost in the hyperinflationary cycle.
In the end, the URV was nothing but a peg, but it was also a very elaborate plan.
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:20:57
I can't say precisely to what extent people were aware of it.
As usually happens during hyperinflationary periods, USD were already used as a price reference for large-value goods such as real estate. People would calculate in USD and just use the correct amount of whatever the local currency of the day was (there were seven of them between 1986 and 1994).
Also, the people I interacted with were generally aware of the peg between the URV and the USD. The broader population might not explicitly know, but the information wasn't kept a secret either: people had to know how many cruzeiros an URV was, and also the dollar exchange rate was generally available, so people could do the math and see the URV closely tracked the USD.
@_date: 2015-05-27 08:24:13
The only thing that matters is real interest rates.
If the price index was at 0 (no inflation or deflation), the nominal interest rate (the one that is quoted by the bank/lender) would be the same as the real interest rate.
If, over a given period of time, inflation is 10% and nominal interest rates are 26.5%, the real interest rate is:
    ( 126.5 / 110 ) - 100 = 15%
Now, your question is how loans would work in a deflationary setting. Let's assume that over a given period the price index falls 20%; you could have negative nominal interest rates which would still yield a positive real interest rate. So we could say the nominal interest rate over this period is -8%. The expression now becomes:
    ( 92 / 80 ) - 100 = 15%
The lender is happy getting less BTC than he lent you, because that nominally smaller amount now purchases a much higher amount of goods and services.

Brazilian here. The URV was in effect pegged to the US dollar. In spite of all the supposed novelty, this was nothing more than a currency peg. The reason why inflation did end was that the peg was maintained *after* the real replaced the cruzeiro. In fact, the government's monetary discipline was so strict that the real even rose above the USD - at one point 1 real was worth $1.20.
There is nothing new under the Sun.

After the official changeover from the cruzeiro to the real and the introduction of real banknotes and coins (July 1994), it wasn't strictly a peg; rather, the central bank was willing to let the real rise but not fall, which is why it got to 120%. Let's say there was a harder lower boundary on the dollar value of the real in the first 6-12 months of the currency introduction. Then, until early 1999, the nominal exchange rate was allowed to fluctuate in such a way as to keep the price-adjusted rate fairly constant. That is, this was a crawling peg.
Before the changeover, during the URV period, the peg was a lot stricter.

What determines the price of a currency is how much of it people want to hold. This is economics.
Now, what follows is purely speculation. Large companies such as Microsoft have been accepting it, but might not want to hold it because of accounting/tax reasons. So they immediately dump the coins they receive.
Long-term adopters might be in need of cash or disbelieving in the currency. This might include people who got into the mining hype.
@_date: 2015-05-27 08:22:58
Any serious economic calculation using bitcoin takes into account its finite total supply, and the fact that more of it will be mined sooner rather than later for any time frame. Also, the general expectation within the community is that adoption drives the exchange rate **way** up, which would mean a strong deflationary pressure.

That comparison is meaningless. First, you cannot compare the money value of the world's assets *today* with the dollar price of a satoshi *in the future*. What I mean is that when 1 satoshi = $1.15, there will likely be way more than $241 tn worth of assets, so the comparison is moot.
Then there's also the conceptual problem of comparing a static variable like wealth with a dynamic variable like the market cap of Bitcoin. Bitcoin gains its value from being used in transactions (from being demanded in transactions, specfically). You could have a "Bitcoin GDP" - the sum of all Bitcoin actual transactions, excluding those between wallets controlled by the same individual - far higher than the total wealth in the world, because that GDP is counted every time a good changes hands in exchange for Bitcoin. And that, not wealth, is what's meaningful to compare with market cap.
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:49:58


Your politically-biased directly contradicts itself.
First of all, this wasn't "public property" as in streets or the Christ the Redeemer (which isn't state-owned anyway, but I digress). What FHC privatized were loss-making, terribly inefficient companies. This was nothing new: this modernizing project had started under Collor, who in this aspect was a pretty decent president (unlike others who followed). Want proof? Just ask any older relative and they can confirm phone lines were listed as assets in your tax returns and they were willed before 1997. I clearly remember seeing Telebrás landlines being worth 2-5 THOUSAND reais. The reason why utilities aren't great in Brazil today is not an excess of competition, but a lack of it, since the BNDES and the regulatory agencies protect the established interests against competition.
Even if nothing of that were true, what God-damned sense does it make to say "he needed the money, so he sold it for cheap"? The only time someone sells something for a significant amount below its market value is when the transaction is made in a hurry. The privatization of Vale, Telebrás and other companies (who are now state-controlled again, by the way - Dilma controls Vale through pension funds, which spells doom for the future prospects of the company) was widely publicized, debated for YEARS, and happened at open auctions.


You're clearly an ideologue, so you probably have never bothered checking your facts. The actual fact is that the IMF exists to provide countries with money at interest rates BELOW those of the open market - if it didn't, why in the hell would countries borrow from it? What it demands in exchange is something so obvious it takes someone as delusional as a Latin American leftist to deny it: that governments don't spend money they don't have.
And boy does Brazil do that. The causes of our lousy public finances are multiple, and usually widely defended by the left:
- *Pharaoh-esque*, questionable state works like the São Francisco river diversion (which has been dearly paid for, even if it doesn't exist);
- huge hydro power plants like Belo Monte, Itaipu, and Balbina;
- bread-and-circus soccer stadiums like those built in the 70s and renovated for the World Cup, and which are now rotting as "white elephants";
- but also tuition-free colleges "for all";
- the single-payer healthcare system;
- workers' "rights" which throw a wrench into the labor market (if there's any foreigner who's made it this far into this rant - did you know there's a whole separate branch of the judicial system meant only to punish employers and reward employees? And that the law that system is based on was imported essentially word-for-word from 1930s Fascist Italy?)
- batshit insanely unsustainable social security;
- corporate welfare;
- aid to leftist dictatorships abroad like Venezuela, where people are better off wiping their butts with banknotes than toilet paper, because what little TP there is has been rendered more expensive than the value of the banknotes by the leftist dictators' policies;
- man, the list goes on and on and on.
Basically, you are sooooooo wrong that the only thing you put the blame for the debt on - privatizations - is actually something that helped *alleviate* the debt. Never forget that Lula clearly stated his economic model was inspired by that of Geisel - as demonstrated by him doing the exact same things the general did.


False. Our elections are in October. The peg collapsed the next January. Because of the Russian crisis. Our policies weren't perfect back then, far from it. But devaluing the real helped us weather FHC's second term. How well are we doing in the current international crisis? Well, **the crisis is f''king over**, everyone in the world is growing by 2-3% (7% in the case of China). Yet Brazil stagnates. Because of people like YOU. As a wise man once said, "são vocês que financiam essa merda!".

If you want to draw wrong conclusions, the best way is to look at a wrong model.
An economy has buyers and sellers. Franchises and leagues are only sellers, the fans/consumers are the buyers. So you need economics to understand (the economic aspects of) sports, not the other way around.






In a free market, no single industry is big enough that a competitor to a monopolist who is charging monopoly prices cannot enter. And if you can simply buy stock of the monopolist, you're diluting his earnings any way - problem solved.


No, a free market isn't rare, it's nonexistent. There can't be a free market if there is a government. The government is an economic actor itself, its existence means none of the other actors can have equality of conditions because government is always, by its nature, a monopoly.

Besides, what causes economic bubbles is one thing only: credit expansion. That's inflationary of fiat, which means it pushes the price of BTC up. When the bubble bursts, that hardly brings the value of fiat back up, because the "sweeping" of the system that happens isn't monetary but real (malinvestments collapsing). So even after the bubble, the value of the USD remains low - and the price of BTC remains high.

Each block mined creates a certain amount of brand new bitcoins. This amount began as 50 per block, and it is cut in half every 210,000 blocks. We're currently at 25, looking at a halving by late July 2016.
When a new block is mined, the new BTC go to whomever mined it. If that is a pool, the coins are distributed to the people who are part of the pool, in proportion of their contributed mining power.
All of the bitcoins in existence are in someone's wallet. They might have lost the keys to that wallet (and consequently lost the bitcoins themselves), but there is no such thing as a bitcoin not attached to a wallet. So, yes, either the miner themself keeps the newly-mined coins, or they sell/spend them to another user. Yes, this is a continuous downward pressure on the price.

No problem, it was an honest question, not assuming you should know.
Anything "marginal" in economics means "what if we add one more?" So, in our example, what matters is the miners' calculation: what if I add one more transaction to my block? Assuming the blocks are not full, the cost of adding another transaction is negligible. So people who want priority in their transactions - who are not necessarily wealthy people - bid higher in the auction (they offer higher transaction fees); but as long as the blocks are not full, miners do include lower-fee transactions in their blocks. It costs them nearly nothing and it brings in some revenue. As long as the marginal revenue of a transaction (its fee) is larger than its marginal cost (the difference in cost between the block with the transaction and without it), the miner has an incentive to include it in the block.
Are you with me so far?

The target is for one block to be mined every ten minutes.
A block is mined whenever some complicated mathematical procedures (called hashing) are completed, using the previous block and the most recent transactions as an input. This can happen 1 minute after the previous block, or 40 minutes. So how is the 10 minutes/block target achieved?
Well, the math behind the hashing is flexible. In order for a block to be valid, it must fulfill a given *difficulty*. Every 2160 (?) blocks, difficulty is reassessed; if past blocks have been mined faster than 1 every 10 minutes, difficulty rises; if slower, it falls. This, by the way, is how we know the halving should happen about ten months from now.
So the Bitcoin money supply grows by 25 BTC every 10 minutes, *give or take*. Because the reward drops by 50% every ~4 years, there will never be more than 21 million BTC in total - that number should be reached by ~2140, and then all the miners will get will be the transaction fees (actually, fees should be miners' main source of revenue long before that).

Do you understand the economic concept of marginal cost?
@_date: 2015-09-05 18:55:06
It was somewhat arbitrary. You could get transactions through with lower fees than that, and even without a fee - the marginal cost for each transaction is *really* low, which is why Bitcoin in general is a cheaper alternative.
And miners' revenues are denominated in Bitcoin, but they probably keep their books in their local fiat currency (because they have to pay the electrical bills). So, as the price of Bitcoin goes up, miners' costs in Bitcoin go down (because they remain the same in fiat).
Eventually, we might start seeing off-chain transactions expand - like a "bank" where we both have accounts, so transactions between you and me don't need to be stored in the blockchain, they only need to be kept in the bank's ledger. Right now it is a bit unclear to me what will happen, because I'm not entirely in on the whole block size debate. Regardless, I'm confident a good solution will be found, particularly if people adhere to the concept of Bitcoin as a market-based currency, not a democratic, voting, "consensus" shitty one like most others issued by governments.

Private as in "private property" is different from private as in "privacy".
Your bitcoins are **yours**. Assuming you take good care of them, nobody can take them from you. Unlike socialism, where everybody owns everything, nobody owns anything and the rulers are actually wealthy.
As for miners, they're paid, stupid. They mine for profit. Even the *pro bono* full nodes and devs profit, in the economic sense - the result they get from their work is preferable to them than not doing it, which is the definition of profit. Yes, value is subjective and you can profit even while losing money - go learn some economics before you stupidly repeat stupid, empty buzzwords.

Wealth distribution is not a problem, you're wrong for thinking it is.
You also don't understand what "market manipulation" is. It has happened only once in the history of Bitcoin, perpetrated by the people who owned Mt. Gox. It didn't happen because they held lots of coins, it happened because they controlled the largest exchange. It was manipulation because they created buy and sell orders using other people's fiat. It was theft, basically.
Apart from that criminal activity, in a free market there is only one way of bringing a price up: buying. People cannot use Bitcoin to buy more Bitcoin (if you know anyone who would be willing to do so, please let me know). If they want to raise the price of the Bitcoin they own, they need to spend other kinds of goods and services to acquire more coins, meaning they don't get wealthier from the trade.
If, on the other hand, someone wants to lower the price, they must sell. By selling, they no longer own the coins. Which also makes you wrong.
Stop with leftist fantasies and learn some fucking economics.

There are two conceptual mistakes here. Let's look at the first one...


FRB existed even during the time of commodity money. Basically, banks issue IOUs for gold (or Bitcoin). These IOUs don't need to be backed by actual deposits, because banks know not all their depositors are going to withdraw at the same time.
Now, Bitcoin is a free market currency. There is no government forcing people to accept it, unlike fiat money (refer to any dollar bills in your wallet - "this note is legal tender for all debts public and private"). If people aren't forced to accept Bitcoin itself, let alone a bank-issued Bitcoin IOU. It is an open question whether FRB would be accepted by the market at all; if it is, reserves would likely be much closer to 100% than they are today. They would be kept like that by the fear of a bank run.


Also incorrect. There are two types of investments: good, profitable ones and bad ones. This is measured by profitability, *net of market interest rates*. The higher (or full) banking reserves would mean the real interest rates would probably be higher than they are today. This means, and you were probably thinking of that when you said the economy would slow down, that many investments which nowadays happen wouldn't happen in a cryptocurrency economy.
However, this is a good thing. Let's take a look at what interest rates are. They are a reflection of the fact that, in order to lend you money today, I want a higher sum when you pay me back. This *time preference* is what gives rise to interest. The market interest rate is determined by the combined time preference of all the actors in the economy - both lenders with more cash than they can profitably utilize at the present, and borrowers with greater need for cash than they currently have (mostly entrepreneurs).
Now, as we have seen, good investments are profitable, even net of market interest rates. However, fiat currency and central banking lower the interest rates below market rates (some stupid countries are even experimenting with negative nominal rates, and many already have negative real rates). This means *malinvestment* can occur - investment whose returns are higher than current interest rates, but lower than market rates. This investment is such that the economy would be better off if it weren't carried out. It creates no wealth, and rather destroys it. People get poorer because of it. They are a waste of scarce resources.
And you recognize it yourself:


The "instability" you're referring to are the recessions and depressions caused by central banking and its consequent malinvestment. While there's an initial apparent boom, the competition for capital goods created by these wasteful projects eventually rises the cost of capital goods for good projects as well. This triggers the crises you see. A malinvestment-free economy, one where the current interest rate dynamically matches the market rate (i.e. that derived from individuals' time preferences), would see no such boom and bust cycles. Only continuous, long-lasting prosperity.

This is monetary theory.
First, what is money? It's that which you demand not for itself, but because you expect to trade it in the future for actual goods and services, things that satisfy a need or want.
Why does a currency have money value today? Because it did yesterday. And why did it have value yesterday? Because it did the day before. And so on and so forth, until this begs the question: why did this currency *first* had value?
In the case of gold, it has value because it **does** have excellent non monetary properties. It is a great electrical conductor, it is extremely malleable, extremely ductile, extremely non reactive. Those are some of its non monetary properties. Besides, it is usually considered aesthetically pleasing. So, it is the fact that gold is useful as something other than money that gave it initial value; and then, because it also has good monetary properties (e.g. fungibility, value density), it was adopted as currency.
Bitcoin has much less useful non-monetary properties (because that's not what it was designed for). Also, its money value isn't established over time yet.
So, the answer to your question is: what bitcoin needs to match gold is time of use and, if possible, better non-monetary use (things like Namecoin and colored coins come to mind as examples).

I'm not demonising anything, and I don't expect people here to be ancap (I find them more coherent if they are, but hey, what would I be if I didn't believe in liberty).
What is no conspiracy theory is that one simply cannot consider Kenyesianism has defeated the Austrians in the marketplace of economic ideas, because the very existence of the state and its need to justify itself completely skews the debate. There is no real marketplace in this case.
Even if one considers creationism and evolution as poles of a debate, I don't think anyone would argue that debate has anything to do with the arguments in favour or against the existence of the state; even climate change denialism is a poor analogy here, as it uses a misguided, ideological conception to argue against one specific (however broad) application of state power, not against the existence of the state.
So, yeah, the state does interfere in the economic debate, because that debate calls its existence into question. It would be even stupider than it already is if it failed to provide incentives to the side which provides it with excuses, however lame they might be.

"Countries" don't adopt Bitcoin. People do. What it takes for someone to adopt? Having some access to an Internet connection and ability to understand, on some level, what Bitcoin is. That is certainly much more widespread than goods such as access to developed countries' bloated welfare state.
And while developed countries' central banks certainly manipulate their currency markets, this manipulation is nowhere near the scale of the manipulation practised by corrupt governments in poor countries. So Bitcoin empowers people in poor countries proportionally more than in rich ones.

No. The people *holding* coins have zero direct effect on the exchange rate. Only the people *trading* coins for fiat directly affect the rate.
Now, the hoarders could affect the rate if the proportion they held of the total amount of Bitcoin in circulation remained constant. This is not the case, as 25 new coins are generated every 10 minutes; so either these people are miners or they are not.
If they are not miners, however many coins they hold becomes a smaller proportion of the total coins in existence every 10 minutes; if they are miners, they are providing everyone in the Bitcoin economy with its most essential services - transaction validation and (for now) expansion of the monetary base - and deserve their reward, especially since they incur costs in providing said service. Electricity, bandwidth and mining rigs don't come for free. However, they do come for a low enough cost that most people can buy them and take part in the mining enterprise, so there's no "income distribution" issue here.
And no, Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme. There are benefits to early adoption, of course, but that is not a bad thing - these people took a risk, they were smarter than us and deserve their profits, but they are not making them *at our expense*, which would be the definition of a Ponzi scheme.

It's *much* cheaper for me to change to another one than to fund them enough so that they will launch violence against others. So, because of market incentives, all DROs will be able to agree with others on arbiters.
In fact, the question is moot because most contracts will specify the arbiters to judge disputes arising out of them... just like contracts now do. Sometimes they pick a government jurisdiction, but quite often they do just what they would do under anarchy: pick a private judicial organisation.

You're right to say I haven't explicitly defined a free market. Here it is: a market is only truly free if no agent can legitimately get a hold of any other agent's property without its owner's consent. There you are: no No True Scotsman.

This is nonsense. By this logic, if everybody instantly spent every coin they earned, the price would drop to zero. This is obviously wrong. The price would drop, yes, because part of that spending would be to buy USD. But spending simply couldn't be directed just to that; people would still want to gamble, buy drugs, buy reddit gold, buy whatever it is they use coins for.

If all exchanges are banned and businesses aren't allowed to accept BTC, that's still different from BTC itself being illegal. Making the currency itself illegal would mean prohibiting people from running a program in their computer, which is plainly absurd. And, if it is just accepting BTC which is illegal, but not the currency itself, then local traders can still easily operate - they could very well be miners, so whatever coins they sell have been mined by themselves and therefore were not accepted from others and not illegal.

With foreign currencies or things like Amazon Coins, there is a controlled (or controllable) set of people who distribute the currency to the public; this means the government can get a list of who purchased how much and cross-reference that with income and capital gains tax data. That is impossible with Bitcoin.
Notice that I don't know how this regulation works in countries like 'Murica, but at least here in Brazil I just can't have someone bring me dollars and sell them around - I need authorisation from the Central Bank to do that, I need to get buyers' tax ID numbers, and so on.

Every 210,000 blocks, the reward for finding a block halves. So, around 2016, instead of getting 25 BTC for finding a block, miners will only get 12.5. In 2020, it'll be 6.25. Then 3.125 in 2024, and so on.
Will they keep mining, then? Many will, some might not. The ones who take their rigs offline are reducing the network's total hashrate, which results in difficulty being adjusted downwards (the remaining miners will find new blocks more easily). It is possible that coins are worth much more in 2016 than they are now, so there's more incentive for people to mine. Also, and most importantly: miners receive all of the transaction fees for the transactions included in the blocks they mine. So, in time, the mining reward will become less important an incentive to mine, and fees will become more important. Win: the network has become self-sustaining in a way it wasn't before.

Is there any other reason for things to be valuable?
When you come to think of it, that's essentially the only reason. This belief can have different reasons: with fiat currencies, the reason is that the issuing government is forcing you to consider them valuable (you must pay your taxes using them and legal tender laws mean you cannot refuse it as payment; yes, that is a shitty reason, because fiat *is* shitty). With commodity currency, the commodity adopted as money should have some properties - it should be scarce, fungible, dense, easy to handle and durable, among others. Precious metals fit this bill, and so does Bitcoin.

Non-aggression is the core of my belief.
Trespassing is aggression. Shooting someone who trespasses is self-defence. If you're OK with someone sanctioned by the state using force to remove someone from my property, then your qualm is not with the use of force itself, just with who is using it.
Now, I like my positions to be coherent. So I want to keep everyone who's unauthorised from trespassing on my property - *including* the government and its tax collector.
Notice that it is precisely because of this view that I won't initiate force against others; I won't trespass on their property, be it in the literal sense of jumping a fence, mugging someone or defrauding them in a business transaction.

I'd recommend you check [this link]( From the Centre for Range Voting (which is also a superb resource on alternate, esoteric voting systems), it describes a system born out of an idea for auctions.
In short, CTT voting means every voter chooses a given amount of money which they commit to each election alternative (for example, a ballot could be "0 BTC for Obama, 0.00000001 BTC for Romney, 1 BTC for Gary Johnson"). The total pledged to each candidate is calculated, and then those voters whose vote individually affected the election pay the difference by which it did; in my example, if Johnson beat Obama by 0.42 BTC, I'd have to pay 0.58 BTC. The recipient of this poll tax would be decided beforehand (the government in a real-world election - this would clearly be unconstitutional; the Bitcoin Foundation in a voluntary vote among us users, for example).
You'll notice Bitcoin has the potential to solve some of the issues this CTT voting system has: anonymous ballot submission should be trivial to achieve with crypto, payment evasion isn't really an issue with Bitcoin escrows and they effectively eliminate the collusion attack outlined in the article.
This system has the desirable properties of encouraging voter honesty and maximising utility. It assumes Bitcoin amounts pledged to each candidate or election alternative are equivalent to each voter's utility for that alternative (which is reasonable, even if debatable), and makes it undesirable for anyone to exaggerate their pledge in either direction - pledge too high and you'll end up paying more than what the result is worth to you; pledge too low and you won't have your way.

There is an intellectual error which I won't commit, which is the "pretence of knowledge". This consists of, well, pretending to know what one cannot possibly know due to there being too many unknown variables - which is what happens in every economic system.
Therefore, I cannot possibly know the specifics of how a truly free market would solve a problem like global warming, because I obviously don't know all the economic and non-economic (meteorological, chemical, biological etc.) factors which come into play. What I *can* explain is the way a free market works *in general*, and I can even try to do that with a specific, hypothetical example, with the caveat that what would actually happen might differ significantly in the details.
The reason why a truly free market always caters to people's demands has nothing to do with any magical assumptions; that reason is that people have a direct, personal interest in catering to others' demands because that makes them a profit, and in fact is the only way to make one. (Nowadays people make loads of money without catering to others' demands because there isn't a truly free market; money circulates by means of coercion, which makes money for folks like politicians and government employees, and coercively-enforced regulations restrict competition, which makes money for those protected from it.) So, if most people would like to have clean energy and it is not being adequately offered, there would be an incentive to provide it and make a lot of money, all the while diminishing the profits of dirty energy.
Now, if most people *don't* prefer clean energy, there's two alternatives: either things which affect the climate like the air or the sea are private property, or they aren't. If they aren't, then the inevitable consequence is the [tragedy of the commons]( which is happening and governments have been and will continue to be powerless to stop. (And if they do stop it, it will be at the cost of tremendous inefficiency.) If these elements affecting the climate are made private, then the tragedy of the commons won't happen, and issues like pollution and global warming can be solved without incurring economic inefficiency. How to properly implement this private-property solution? I don't know - I don't pretend to know what the free market solution is which is presently prevented by coercive agents.

As I said before, even if Bitcoin is restricted to the black market, I'm OK with that. And, in a black market, people are already, by definition, transacting on banned goods and services. Using a banned means of exchange doesn't make it any *blacker*, so carries little to no extra cost or risk. Therefore, whatever liquidity Bitcoin derives strictly from its usage in the black market is essentially immutable.
That being said, yes, its price would go down if it suddenly became impossible to trade for legal merchandise. But, as I have said a couple times, I'm fine with that, especially because the black market guarantees that a ban won't drag the price all the way down to zero.

I have: it's the non-aggression principle. But apparently you cannot recognise coherence if it jumps on your face like an Alien hatchling.
Regarding the two people: both of them know that the person who's currently in possession of the property has, at first sight, a more valid claim to self-defence. So, if I'm not that person, I simply won't start what will be seen by everyone as an act of trespassing.
In that case, I will contact my private dispute resolution organisation (DRO), and present to them my reasons to believe I have a more rightful claim to that property (for instance, I can produce a contract between me and the occupant whereby they've sold it to me, I can prove that I paid and they still haven't vacated the premises). They will contact the other person and present my reasons; I assume they have their own reasons not to vacate the property (let's say I had agreed they would remain there for some time, which hasn't expired). In the end, if no resolution can be arrived at by consensus, my DRO would contact their DRO. If theirs agree I'm right (let's say, if their time to vacate has expired), they will let mine forcefully remove the trespasser and protect me if he tries to trespass again; in this case, they aren't bound by their contract with him to protect him because he is in breach with his contract with me.
If, finally, that person's DRO does not agree with mine, they will set up a judicial proceeding (which would happen if both I and them have good reasons to believe we're the owner). The arbiter will judge according to a given private code of law; because both I and the other person agreed, in our contract with each other and with our DROs, to accept these results, we will accept these results. If I lose, he keeps his rightful property; if I win, I earn it.

This is incorrect.

Miners are not "allowed" by the "public" to mine new coins; they just do. The only way to prevent them is to shut down the network altogether, or to prevent clients which enforce these rules from running.

And, because USD are being printed out of Bernanke's arse, the trend is not for their purchasing power to go up like this, but rather all the way down.

There are quite some nasty things governments (including central banks) can do to harm Bitcoin; what you suggest is definitely not among them.
If they bought up loads of coins, they'd be simply raising the price, making us all richer and devaluing their own currency. Now, this is what they usually do, except that when they do it by their usual means - printing money to give to the banks - they are actually making a profit out of it, whereas by buying coins they'd be making losses (due to devaluing their fiat money).
Not only that, but also the rising price would be seen as a signal of Bitcoin's strength, which would prompt more people to adopt the currency, which is bad for central banks - they'd be just helping their competition! And, in that scenario, the Bitcoin economy would just grow and mature and deepen, so when central banks started dumping coins, not only the fiat currency they'd be asking for them would be less valuable than when they bought, but the economy would simply adjust around the drop in price. Either there would be people willing to buy the central bank's coins, which means they keep circulating within the BTC economy, or there wouldn't, which means Bernanke would have to lower his asking price, thus making heavier losses.

I know. But if we don't explain the miner's reward halves every 210000 blocks, people might *think* it does. And, with that wrong idea in mind, they might find out half of all bitcoins have already been mined; at 25 per block and 10 minutes per block, mining the other half would indeed take something short of eight years.
For people used to thinking a currency slowly and unlimitedly inflating is a good thing, a sudden and irreversible stop in the expansion of the monetary base is nothing short of tragedy. Heck, *I* wouldn't trust Bitcoin so much if there was a d-day after which the game overnight would change completely from somewhat predictable inflation to totally unpredictable deflation. So I think it is a good thing to alleviate the fear this misconception - which I hope you agree isn't impossible to arrive at given the way the paragraph is currently formulated - would cause to potential adopters.

They don't give a shit about the bucks, but they do give a shit about the coins. People transacting using coins as their unit of account are precisely what our economy needs. That way, the value of BTC will become more and more attached to real-life goods and services instead of just floating relative to fiat.
@_date: 2013-02-20 07:24:46
The basis of your reasoning is sound: as long as people use BTC for gambling and drugs, there will be a demand for it. But this doesn't mean its price will go up indefinitely. There is a limit to demand. I mean, consider all the people who are using BTC for these ends. They don't have unlimited resources to put into playing or tripping. If we got to a point where everybody who wanted to gamble or buy dope only did so in BTC (and no other currencies), then demand for the currency from those sources simply cannot grow, and the price from this component of demand won't grow.
It is reasonable, though, to consider some factors:
1 - not nearly all people who want to purchase these goods use BTC yet;
2 - not all of them won't ever use BTC;
3 - the legal status of these activities fluctuates - with a reasonably clear signal that drugs will progressively become more legal, and therefore purchasable with fiat currency, over the next decade or so;
4 - BTC demand doesn't just stem from these sources;
5 - BTC might still crash badly, its value falling down to zero.
So, what I'm saying is you have to have a more nuanced approach to Bitcoin. It is my opinion that it is worth adopting, but that doesn't stem only from its illicit value.

Although that's correct, one has to bear in mind Keynesianism is inherently statist, and Bitcoin challenges one of the fundamental aspects of a state, its monopoly on deciding what its currency is. Even if a government adopted Bitcoin, it would still be surrendering a serious amount of what is usually viewed as sovereignty.
@_date: 2013-02-22 21:59:15


Yes, for two reasons: more transactions mean more demand which mean a higher price of Bitcoin, increasing the value of rewards as measured against fiat/metals. *And* more transactions mean more transaction fees, which are separate from the rewards but also collected by miners. When a miner generates a block, they get not only the reward (currently BTC 25) but all of the fees relative to the transactions contained within that block. People include these fees precisely as an incentive for the miners.

First of all, everyone is the owner of themselves. This might sound obvious, but is not taken for granted when, in a statist society, there is something like conscription, for instance.
Second, everyone owns that property (particularly land) they have homesteaded, they have by their work turned into a condition where it can provide useful goods to be traded with others.
And thirdly, everyone owns whatever they've earned from peaceful, voluntary, non-fraudulent transactions with others.
Governments aren't needed to ensure property rights.

What this implies is: value is value is value. You seem to complain about the decoupling between the "value of money" and the "value of goods/services". There is no such decoupling. Value is value is value. I'm in on Bitcoin to make money just as much as I am in it to fight the powah. Stop worrying about transactions between third parties. That's not something which is yours to worry about. If you're worried about the effect such transactions have on you, reduce your exposure to them. Spend all your coins on fiat.

This is a great explanation. I think there is one point which can be improved: mentioning, even *en passant*, the reward halving. I'm supposing the reader is smart enough to project this aspect of Bitcoin into the future and an event where the 21-millionth bitcoin is finally mined around 2021 might sound a bit scary, especially for people accustomed to unlimited fiat currency.
So, I'd rephrase it somewhat like this:


You could probably turn this into a better rephrasing, should you agree with the idea of conveying the reward halving. This explanation isn't 100% technically correct, but explaining a convergent series would *definitely* be out of scope here :)
Edit: spelling, improved the rephrasing.

This is an interesting calculation, but I see no economic reason to think the value of Bitcoin should converge to that of gold. The value of each of these commodities will depend on the supply and demand for them, like any other good. The practical advantages of Bitcoin might make each unit (or any fraction of the total monetary base, for that matter) worth much more than the comparable fraction of the amount of gold in existence, while its known and as-yet unknown flaws might make it worth less (all the way down to zero).

Yes, and that the central authority issuing the money is the one profiting from such lag, which is why their optimal strategy is to inflate the fuck out of the currency.
When there is a free market for currencies, this is countered by people simply reducing their exposure to the currency which is being inflated by its issuing authority. Governmental coercion in the form of taxation, legal tender laws (which forbid you from refusing fiat as a means of payment) and outright confiscation (which FDR did with gold in 1933) prevents this from happening, because fiat cannot coexist with a free currency market.

Three points:
* as 17chk4u said, do emphasise mining is related to the "blockchain" (the ledger) itself. One possible rephrasing could be "Bitcoins are issued to “miners” who use cpus to generate solutions to problems *which involve confirming previous transactions*."
* I think affirming the US government is trying to shut Bitcoin down is a bit too strong. There might be some within the intelligence community and the Fed/fractional reserve banking system which are getting anxious, yes, but so far this has not resulted in an all-out policy of eradicating Bitcoin. So I'd nuance that part.
* The fact that a Marxist perspective sees Bitcoin as a threat and a bad thing makes me very happy to support it and see it as a good thing!

This particular version is not a typical incarnation of this type of graph (actually, the fact that it is so odd is part of the reason why this thread was created).
The horizontal axis represents the price of Bitcoin in US dollars in the biggest exchange, Mt. Gox. The trick here is that each of the three lines - brown, green and blue - has a different scale on the vertical axis.
The green line is simply a graph of the price of BTC against the USD over time; it's like most graphs we're used to, except it's flipped (these graphs usually have time on the x-axis and price on the y-axis).
The brown line shows the total amount of dollars being offered in exchange for BTCs at a given price; its scale is to the left. So, if the highest offer for BTC is to buy 10 BTC at $25.50, the graph will start at the point ($25.50 , $255). Next, if someone is offering to buy 4 BTC at $25.40 (for a total $101.60), the next point will be at ($25.40 , $356.60). The graph goes on, checking how much people want to buy and for what price and connecting these points.
The blue line is basically just the same as the brown one, but reversed: how many bitcoins people are willing to sell for a given price. This particular version of the graph is interesting because someone has (according to the graph, at least) offered to sell 210 000 BTC, or 1% of all bitcoins that will ever exist, for something like $25.80 each.
Edit: I screwed up, the *left* scale is in BTC and the *right* one is in $. That's more useful because it shows how many of a given type of order would have to be given to bring the price to a given level.

There is a *huge* distinction between trespassing and civilly contesting the ownership of something. The former is aggression, which can be met with defensive force, and I don't give a crap whether you consider that makes me violent - I know self-defence is not aggression. The latter is not aggression either; if I have a concrete, objective reason to contest your claim to ownership of a piece of land (not some bullshit like "my ancestors weren't offered that"), I just sue you...

By Keynesians. Who are wrong.
Money has value. Do you think it is really bad if people cling to something that has value as much as they possibly can? I don't.
The fact that money is by definition the most liquid commodity doesn't change the fact that it is a commodity and, as such, its value is best determined by the market. If that means deflation, so be it - that means its value rising is the most effective outcome for the economy.

People are mentioning 2140... if Bitcoin goes on to be widely accepted, and replaces governmental monopoly money, then fees will become the main source of revenue for miners *long* before 2140. The reward will be less than 1 BTC as early as 2032. In a context where coins are used mostly everywhere, the number of transactions needed for fees to surpass that value will have easily been reached.

Back in the days of gold, you could have three types of banking services.
The first was analogous to safety deposit boxes: you deposit a given amount of gold and you can withdraw it whenever you like. Since gold is fungible, the bank doesn't actually have to keep separate boxes or vaults for each customer, but it must securely hold all of the gold people deposit there. The bank charges storage fees to cover its costs, so the total amount a customer may withdraw slowly diminishes with time.
The second was a sort of a loan aggregator: it received deposits and loaned out the deposited gold. After a given period, the depositor received interest on his money. The drawback, for the depositor, was that he couldn't withdraw his gold before a contractually-established period elapsed, because that was related to the maturation of the bank's loans. Bank profits derived from the risk they were taking that the loan-takers defaulted.
Both these forms of banking are perfectly OK, and variations of them exist to this day.
Fractional reserve banking is, strictly speaking, just a mongrel combination of the two previous forms. It promises depositors instant liquidity, like safety deposit banking, and lends their gold away, like loan aggregators. Fractional reserve banking doesn't depend on lending away paper substitutes for gold - it could well lend out depositors' gold. It hopes and prays no more depositors will try to withdraw than those they can afford to pay with their fractional reserves. Well, because FRB has historically developed as lending paper substitutes instead of actual money, it ended up co-opting an actor capable of doing the same in a larger scale and with less risk - the state.
By its use of force, the state can coerce depositors to take losses when there is a bank run and the banks' reserves are insufficient. And fiat currency is just the next logical step in the development which started with real, gold money, passed through fraudulent FRB paper promises of delivering gold and ends with Bernanke Bucks.
Considering this, the first kind of banking (safety deposit boxes) is conceivable, but perhaps not entirely necessary, with Bitcoin; the second is possible and desirable; and the third is unnecessary, because it is intrinsically a scam.

The only way that would be relevant to this discussion was if the theory of monetary neutrality were true: it doesn't matter if all of a sudden the Fed prints as many dollars as are already in circulation, because then the price of everything would just double and the net effect would be null.
The theory isn't true because information about the growth of the monetary base doesn't flow instantly; instead, some actors (namely, the Fed itself and banks) have a priority in this information flow and, in effect, benefit from inflation, at the expense of "the rest of us".
This is in stark contrast with Bitcoin, where the total monetary base is fixed at 21M BTC and its growth rate is known to everyone beforehand (one block per 10 minutes on average).

There's another aspect to this. If the investments being subsidised by inflation are by definition sub-prime, then in other words what is happening is a misallocation of capital.

Governments then present themselves as the saviours of the crisis they were the main guilty parties in manufacturing.

Yes. In that respect, in what pertains to both these actions being performed for the self-interest of the people committing them, they are equivalent.


I assume the reason you're invoking "social benefit" is to justify why one of these actions is ethical - in fact, it is praiseworthy - and the other is unethical and abhorrent. If that is the case, your ethics is collectivist, which not only poses its own ethical problems, but is less elegant than an alternative solution: the reason why raping and killing is wrong is because it harms *an individual*. It would be just as wrong if committed on a desert island, where no "social benefit" can be claimed.
Again, this more general and more elegant solution is to be preferred to your less solid version of ethics as "social benefit". The question then becomes: when I'm buying and selling bitcoins - because that's what "speculation" boils down to - am I causing harm to someone else? That harm must be specific - that someone must be losing something determined -, it must be objective - it must be possible to prove that person had something before and didn't have it afterwards -, and that someone must be a defined individual. Given these criteria, what harm do speculators do?
The weakness of your position becomes clear through this sentence:


"Less preferred" by whom? Speculators themselves? Certainly not. "Society"? I'm a part of society and I don't feel harmed - why is your opinion more worth than mine? (And even if absolutely everyone was opposed to a given transaction except the two people involved in it, the majority still would have absolutely zero right to prevent such transaction from happening.) The Bitcoin economy? It has been amply demonstrated, here in this thread and elsewhere, that speculators *benefit* it instead of harming it, so even if the economy was an agent, it would have reasons to more-prefer speculation rather than less-prefer it.
You're living under the conception that it is legitimate for third parties to prevent voluntary transactions between individuals. You're morally wrong with that, and Bitcoin should be a potent lesson in that.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:48:16
Bitcoin division is simply an accounting "trick"; it doesn't effectively change anything, it doesn't make anyone richer or poorer.
Inflation does move wealth around, basically to whomever is creating the new money (miners, in this case). In order for hard forks to be viable, they have to be accepted by the network. Users just don't have any reason to accept an inflationary fork. Even if every existing miner tries to push for this fork, people can wipe the dust off their old GPUs and begin mining again, using the old, 21M-limit rules, and they'll make a lot of money because people, and their transaction fees, would flock to these miners.
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:17:28

There is a theory in economics called money neutrality. If the total money supply in an economy is 100 units and in a moment it somehow doubles, that shouldn't matter because all prices would simply double as well, so money is "neutral" in the sense that it doesn't really affect people's purchasing power.
People then realised this theory is wrong when the creation of money is centralised by an individual or small group, like what happens with the Fed or in OP's example. For money neutrality to hold, everybody would have to know immediately that the money supply - the total amount of money in the economy - had changed, and they'd have to be free to adjust the prices they charge and pay in their transactions accordingly. These conditions don't hold true either for the Fed or for the JPMorganCoin. When these conditions are false, whoever controls the creation of money has an advantage over everyone else, because they can use newly-created money to pay for stuff at the old, wrong price.
This fact is precisely one of the big advantages of Bitcoin over fiat currencies. There is inflation (the monetary base grows by 25 coins every 10 minutes or so), but it is entirely predictable and distributed (nobody knows who's gonna end up finding the next block).

Even disregarding wallet losses, this could, in principle, be a problem: what happens when even one satoshi (BTC 0.00000001) is too big for transactions people want to make? This could well happen in a scenario where Bitcoin is universally accepted.
Well, this is what happens: long before this begins to be a possible concern for everyday users, there will be some people for whom this becomes an issue (high-frequency stock market traders could be a present-day example, although it is not possible to predict who exactly will face this problem if and when we face this divisibility problem). There would then be an incentive, in the form of demand from these people, for miners to run an enhanced version of the Bitcoin client, one which accepted the division of 1 BTC in more than 10^8 sub-units. Problem solved.
Now, the taking of coins out of circulation - either lost or hoarded, which, as has been pointed out, are indistinguishable - has only one effect on this process, which is of making it begin earlier. After all, if at some point (say) 17 million coins have been mined but only 16 million are actively used in trade, the value of each of them is higher (by a factor of 17/16) than it would be if no coins were lost or hoarded, but the real-world interactions which demand sub-satoshi transactions are potentially the same, increasing the demand for a finer subdivision.
To me at least, part of the beauty of the Bitcoin protocol is that an arbitrarily large economy can use it even if there is only one satoshi (or less) being traded around.

And what are buckyballs?? I only know this term in the "architectural concept created by R. Buckminster Fuller" sense, not in the anything-that's-illegal sense. Why was it banned?
Regarding Amex - I don't think people would *riot*, but I do believe there would be a severe backlash, yes. The reason the Streisand effect would be negligible is because it is already ubiquitously well-known. And it doesn't matter whether established businesses cease operating with Bitcoin if it is banned; what matters is that other, black-market businesses would come up to fill the void.
Since you are a typical redditor, I presume you're American. I think you don't really grasp how strong the black market can be, particularly for stuff other than drugs. I live in Brazil. In neighbouring Argentina, their crazy-ass President Fernández has introduced a supermarket price freeze, something we've already tried and thankfully learned doesn't work. It is an *inevitable* consequence of such a policy that shortages will happen, at least for some goods, and black markets will spring up. Even if Bitcoin isn't universally spread when a hypothetical ban comes, people who were used to dealing with it in even niche markets will find a way to keep doing so. And there's only so much the government can do to prevent people from trading before it comes back to haunt them.

No, I mean governments. It's they, not banks, who assert a monopoly on money in their territories. (Fractional reserve) banks are just leeches benefiting from said monopoly.
I'm curious as to why you think governments may have potential uses for Bitcoin. What do you think such uses could be? What can governments do with a currency they can't control or counterfeit that they can't do with their fiat currencies?

"Libertarian" (anarcho-capitalist) here. Our solution to ecology is simple, it is basically the same as that for everything else: property rights. Make everything - including the environment - private property and let the market take care of the issues. Pollution? That's infringing on private property, which gives rise to liability, so there are incentives not to pollute. Energy efficiency? Set the market free and each individual will get as efficient an energy as they're willing to pay for.
Climate change is probably the most egregious example in history of the tragedy of the commons, a problem to which the only solution is the implementation of private property.

You have insurance (if you don't, you ought to have). Insurance companies would have an incentive to prevent things like this from happening - like paying for carbon sinks, for instance.

Erm... it's not that I disagree with you, but the cost he mentioned is $67K *a day*. I guess that does feed a family for a year.
But I'm also interested in what you said about non-CPU mining being orders of magnitude more efficient. Could you please link to some more specific data?

Never trust your standards to governments and their international organisations, either.

If someone trespasses and you can deal with it, you do. You have also to be prepared for the case where you can't. Once again: people are smarter than you - deal with it.
Edit: besides, everyone but you is smart enough to realise that divergences of opinion will happen not only on real property, or regarding competing claims to it, but in the wider world as well, and for that you need a DRO.

I'd think that assumes the debtor has a revenue source in another currency, which is not the case with Bitcoin companies, right?

Why would you spend money which will be worth more tomorrow than it is today?
If you needed to, that's why. So a deflationary currency helps direct investment only towards what is actually needed by real people. Fake money being pumped into the economy misdirects investment, generating poverty and depressions much like the current one.

You're thinking Keynesian. That's bullshit.
I will continue paying for my reddit gold with bitcoins. People will continue buying their drugs at Silk Road or whatnot. Let's not even get started about when the migrant remittance business discovers Bitcoin.
People need to do business transactions to survive. This doesn't depend on the value of the currency they use, as compared to its own value in other points in time or compared to other currencies.

That's nice, thank you. And I imagine that, if the change we had to make was important but not urgent, we could have a transitional period where the new programs used the old rules, right? So as to give everybody the time to catch up?

I sort of doubt it. *There is not* much law about Bitcoin, so there isn't much to explain. Everybody knows it is used at Silk Road and other similar markets, so it is only reasonable for the EFF to keep its ass off the line against possible "guilt by association".

Is there such a thing? Isn't this business absurdly regulated?

Why are there grey lines above the blue line of selling orders? In this graph they seem to be parallel to the blue line, but I've also seen another graph like this where it wasn't.
