Can you build in the option to use the Firefox and IE engines? I know that's a lot to ask but I really want a browser that doesn't rely on one engine :) It can even be contingent on having Firefox/IE installed if necessary.

As always, the government is blind to the real issues. What about the ones who don't use shoes? It should be public knowledge by now that all the REAL terrorists don't wear shoes, what is our president doing?! I'm outraged.

It's common to have a method of escalation for off business hours. They are probably not actively working on the weekend, nor should we expect them to.

Does he go into these tangible benefits? I'm at work right now so I can't listen to it. If he does, that's absolutely fantastic. People need to understand that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not just a store of value, they are frameworks for a fully digitized asset trading system that does not rely on a central authority(except it does, the blockchain ledger, but that's another matter entirely.) I hope he didn't just leave it at "the value of bitcoin is something you need to decide for yourself."

That's absolutely the wrong assumption to make. Operating cost savings turn into profit for companies almost universally. The only time they are passed along to a customer is during sales. To think anything else is to be naive about business strategy.

What kind of tool quotes himself in an article? Filling whitespace is great, but that's just asinine.

Two reasons:
1. China's population at large probably doesn't understand the impact of this problem.
2. Most bitcoin speculators, especially traders who do not mine, don't understand the importance of mining and validation of their transactions. Bitcoin is a game for them, to be played like any other stock market. This is irrelevant until it has a direct impact on them.
2 probably has the most impact. Of course I could be wrong and the market could just be slow to react.

As I understand it, the best practice is to verify the source, destination, value, and time of the transfer rather than tracking a txid.

I don't know.. because it costs money?
Get a grip people.

Replace compromised with brute forced and you're correct. There is a difference. However, anyone with a modest interest in computer science will dismiss anything that mentions traditional brute forcing these days. It's the digital equivalent of banging your head against a wall until the wall breaks down. It's just not how people work. There are many more sophisticated types of attacks being used today, but I won't go into that. If you're truly interested, the closest place to where we are now would be You can start there.

I'm glad to hear it. I'll check it out later. Really refreshing to see public speakers promoting the real meat of cryptocurrency.

At what point did you suddenly believe that word of mouth has any intrinsic value in legislation? The path to hell is paved with good intentions.
Also, first post to this sub. I wish I had more stake in bitcoin :[

The Satoshi force is strong with this one.

That's my hope! Holding on for dear life at this point. In any case I hope you're right about the bill.

Congratulations, man. I was not smart enough and left all my coins in an account on Slush's pool, my account is long gone after a couple of years of "forgetting about it."

Can you elaborate on this? As a young person I am interested.
