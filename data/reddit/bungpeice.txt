What what in the fuck fuck. How do they cause more harm than political corruption?

Or maybe when they arrested him his wallet was open or the key was in ram in clear text. There are plenty of ways to get it.

Yeah my grocery store doesn't take credit cards at all. Just debit or cash.

Same here though I went in with the plan of holding a min of 1 year for tax purposes. The dip doesn't bother me because I'm already locked in for a while yet. If things ate still bad in a year... Who cares because there ain't shit I can do about it. I'll sell at a loss. I was gonna take the cash to Vegas anyway. This is probably a better choice.

That depends on how much money you have. You could dump some in exchanges to tank the price and then make a buy off the exchanges at the diminished price. I beleive there is a mechanism to do this if you are loaded

Because you made the the choice not to save and lump invest. You are making a scheduled investment. You could dca that 100 bucks though. The general probability is that your token is gonna be worth less at day 1 than the end of month ten and has the greatest potential to appreciate the earlier you buy

There is no way to copyright a fashion design. as soon as you create it someone can copy it and mass produce it legally (usually at a lower quality and price). That industry seems fine to me.

You are on the right track. Change is hard and takes a lot of work. It might take years but you will get there. My only other suggestions are get to the doctor and get some bloodwork done and make sure you are 100% healthy and exercise daily. Learning to exercise has changed my life more than any other thing. I used to be depressed, smoke too much weed, and used to game too much. Learning to exercise helped me with impulse control and the chemicals it release make me feel much more like a normal person (Also doing activities is a good way to meet cool people and gives you self reliance. It is pretty awesome to go on a hike and get back knowing you got yourself through it.) Also if your therapist supports it maybe consider getting away from your family. It sounds like they might be hindering your progress. It doesn't sound like a great environment. You don't have to cut off contact but maybe a new town and a new job might help or just moving out if you live with them.
This is going to be one of the most challenging things you have ever done, just remember while there is no changing the past, fixing the present and striving for a better future are all very possible. Start living like the person you want to be, even it it feels  weird and fake. You will get there. Good Luck!

The common thread in all those unexciting encounters is you. I regularly meet extremely compelling people as do most other folks. This is why most people seem to only go a couple years at most between relationships. You might need to do some reflection. The dates might not be fun because you aren't fun to be around.
