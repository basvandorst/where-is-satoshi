Well, now we have a few answers... It seems like a reasonable solution. I do not know if I had BTC stolen or not and I have USD, ETC, ETH, and BTC and have no problem helping others out (not that I had much to begin with). Good work BFX.

I agree what what you are saying. I have been patient but with the radio silence, I am becoming more and more doubtful. 
1). I have been thinking the same, however in the past couple of hours, I am seeing no activity on the status page, which is even more alarming. From my understanding, their data center is in Italy (correct me if this is incorrect) and I feel that the hack could have been from within the data center. You have sys admins that can gain access, root access, to servers (I would assume) and have the opportunity because data centers are not usually hubs of human activity, thus making this an "inside" job albeit not from inside BFX. This could be delaying things as well if the thief (refuse to use hacker because it is defamation against us white hats) works at the data center. Or they just just be shutting everything down to regroup.
2). Yes, politics could be getting in the way of progress as it does in most paces.
3). Very possible indeed.
4). There needs to be some sort of communication or as you say, the lawyers will start seeing dollar signs.
5). Even if there was a time set, say once an hour, to at least announce that there was no announcement would be better than nothing at all. 
6). The decided to close the doors, shut down operations, and file bankruptcy.


Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more: It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
