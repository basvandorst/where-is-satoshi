I agree with most comments that the quiz has some issues, like...
1) "yes/no/I forget" questions should not be on a scale of agreement
2) age choices shouldn't overlap
3) affiliation question having radio buttons should have had check-boxes
4) having negatives in scale-of-agreement questions is annoying. I wouldn't hope that you strongly disagree that I'm not wrong.
5) "get your hands on a bitcoin" is ambiguous and could be talking about knowing how to purchase or knowing how to make a paper wallet
6) "first transaction" is ambiguous because it could mean the first coinbase transaction, the first address-to-address transaction, or the first transaction for goods (i.e. B10k pizzas)
It's pretty funny that so many comments here mention legislation changes from two weeks ago, when they have nothing to do with the correct answer to that question, though!

The guy has a hardcore Canadian accent, so I don't blame you for having trouble. I'm not going to transcribe but I can summarize...
He explained the differences between bitcoin and fiat (which TIL is called fiduciary currency in French), how fiat works, how the banking system is expensive for account holders, slow, and how central banks are used by governments, providing the US, Canada, Zimbabwe and Argentina as examples. He mentions all the info banks have on you and how many hands your info goes through every time you use a credit card, and billions worth of fraud have been caused by all this data floating around poorly secured.
Bitcoin, he continues, only needs a sender, a receiver, and an amount, with no documentation, so that should help with identity theft and fraud. transactions take seconds and are confirmed in minutes. He does not mention irreversibility, consumer protections and all the other caveats that should be part of any healthy bitcoin debate. He glosses over what the blockchain is, how asymmetric crypto works, and doesn't go into mining at all.
He mentions Satoshi Nakamoto and the whitepaper, and how bitcoin is a glimpse of what a free (as in freedom) financial system can be without all the overhead. He ended by saying imagination is the limit and bitcoin is the future.
At one point he polled the audience with some questions, and 4 people there already owned bitcoin. And I did not expect to write so much!

Since it seems that public keys are an attack vector, and public keys are exposed after spending from an address, it might be interesting to see how much money is "at risk" by looking at how many bitcoins are in UTXOs in addresses that have previously been spent from...

Everyone here is correct that 0-confirmation transactions for low amounts, with fees, are safe to accept and most merchants don't make you wait for a confirmation. But on the off chance that you actually paid from your Coinbase account, the transaction was zero-risk and zero-fee because it didn't even happen on the block chain.
Off-chain transactions can be used when a centralized entity just re-arranges what is on its internal ledger. Most tipping platforms (e.g. changetip) use off-chain transactions, too.

Accents are accents. What surprised me was that "app" somehow seemed masculin and feminin depending on context and was immune to consonant liaison.
Masculine: "...downloader **le** app 'Bitcoin Wallet'..." "...code QR dans **mon** app"
Feminine: "...plein d'apps à downloader, mais **la** meilleure, c'est **celle** qu'on..."

This could probably be worded better. Maybe "bitcoin's fees are much lower than credit cards".
Maybe mention that using a payment processor doesn't expose them to currency risks or increase tax burden. I know 140 characters isn't a lot, but try to make the most of them.

AFAIK, all ETFs work this way, including gold and silver ETFs.
**Edit** with example: GLD is a gold ETF that has been around for nearly 10 years. When it started, one share was exactly worth one tenth of a Troy ounce of gold. Today's price of a tenth of a Troy ounce of gold: $134. Today's price of GLD: $128.

BS. You could have split the reward if he did in fact report it before a fix went live and before you acknowledged publicly that there was a bug. It's not his fault he wasn't the first to discover it before it was fixed. By not paying, how likely is he to try to help again?

You're trying to say that "megabit" would be a confusing amount of currency. But nobody has ever paid a megadollar or megafranc for anything. No one talks about gigapeso houses or kilolire coffees. Bitcoin has enough problems with adoption that you don't need to invent fake ones.

That's an odd conclusion. By using bitcoin, the consumer doesn't have to trust the merchant to not screw up how his debit/credit card is stored (tons of merchants have been hacked and leaked card info). By using bitcoin, the merchant has lower fees, doesn't have to worry about a chargeback weeks later, and the payment processor usually settles to fiat in their bank every day or two


Instead of depositing cash, it's more like sending a wire due to sender fees, and confirmation time. The consumer didn't pay a bitcoin miner fee (zero fee) and no one has to wait for a confirmation block because Coinbase already verified the consumer's account has enough to cover the cost of the item being purchased (zero risk).

Wait wait wait. If you are admitting to bitcoin sellers that you are trying to give money to criminals, don't they have an obligation to refuse the sale??
I've seen so many stories about people selling bitcoin to disguised cops through LocalBitcoin who say they will use the bitcoin to buy stolen credit cards or whatever, which leads to the arrest of the seller for enabling illegal activity.

Uh, you realize that your link checks that pindexBestForkBase isn't null, but the bug found by the darkcoin dev involves phashBlock being null. So no, not fixed.
I'm surprised that these fixes ([bitcoin]( [darkcoin]( forego the warnings completely if data is missing, rather than using "UNKNOWN" or some other placeholder. Doesn't seem like good practice to to sweep the problem under the rug just because there's a second problem.
