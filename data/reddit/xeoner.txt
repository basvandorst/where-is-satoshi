are you looking for academic or occult science?
  
this book is very good and is in between of those. not exactly related to bitcoins but probably predicted some of the aspects of the bitcoins. need more confirmations and opinions. nevertheless it's strong in psychology..  
freicoin an altcoin fork has implemented the basic idea behind this book..
also do a research upon the author first..

I agree. But they can ban but can not control it.  
Like humans have been using various substances  
throughout whole human history. But they could ban it.  
Or they couldn't?

It used to be under 1 usd (about .8-.9).. still the pricechart looked terrible..  
now it's almost 1.5.. Which is exactly 1.2% (.6 doubled) of 130..  
Is it gonna be 15 when price reach a 1000 per coin?  
That's nonsense &amp; intrinsic instability..  
No wonder it had collapsed back then..

please don't even mention ddos anymore, ever.
ddos attack is not a perfect excuse, not a scapegoat.
best people can't afford losing hard earned cash no matter what.
there's no pub logs, no network mrtg graphs, no proof at all.
there are genius it professionals in this world, which can deal with anything.
whatever it is. please go find the best people first or go open source instead
and let the community do what you must have been doing for so long.
Or maybe it's just that a centralized infrastructure is failing
 when the p2p bitcoin nature emerges.

The concept itself is great. But 30 btc only for the entry? That sucks since 2011..  
Besides they do not reveal oi, the most important param in option trading..
@_date: 2013-04-20 12:35:15
No they are not, precisely because of this inversion it gets exotic.  
I've been researching these mindfucking contracts for months.
Also the fee is charged in btcs, which is unacceptable,  
basically this means that the exchange hedges its own fee risk  
by transferring it to their customers/traders/hedgers, sure enough  
this only brings more non-linearity and ever widening spread. 
Having fees below 1% is very important for the fut mkt,  
as all spot exchange services include hedging costs in their fees.  
Currently the number is as high as 3.7% at the very least,  
and it keeps constantly rising along with the bitcoin spot price..  
Not mentioning the synthetic spread caused by these very fees,  
which is essentially becomes additional heding fee..
No wonder what we've got is the spot price +/- 10% in the otc offers..

I guess i really meant this federal massive structure behind the system.   
Which these poor devils don't question. Their crime is lie, ignorance and conformism.    
Nowadays more crimes are committed because they enforce unenforcable laws.  
Even the term enforce implies coercion and violence..  
I believe this is not how true laws of the universe operate..  
How about the civil war which they breed and extract profit from?  
About prosecution of the best people for possession of the psychedelics,    
the precious medicine which could cure many millions human beings  
out of this downward spiraling of massive global self-destruction?  
What about the evolution of the human spirit  
which they resist however they can?

Ahh transparency.. They forgot to tell us actually it's a feature.. Or maybe not?
@_date: 2013-09-14 14:44:58
what exactly did you change?
@_date: 2013-06-05 11:21:18
Can they ban cash? Don't you see how it's different?  
Because it would be easier for them to ban coins which they can't control  
than to deal with the issue which they don't really know what to do about..  
Their business is to do as least as possible while staying in power..
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:12:53
Exactly. They aren't here to help us in any way.  
Corrupted and violent bastards doing their own biz.  
@_date: 2013-06-05 13:04:07


Disagree. Sincerely.
That's precisely the point. The current cultural paradigm of the western world   
constantly brainwash us that a human being is fundamentally evil..
But i stand for that we are essentially good and virtuous beings.  
Even if some of us haven't gotten an awareness of this yet.  
Haven't found this universal truth within themselves.  
The mere existence of the repressive system  
causes violence and crime itself. 
Currently their violent methods do not change anything,   
Violence brings only more violence in this world.   
Education instead of repression. And the truth instead of lies..   
While any delegation of power of one over another  
has always been and will always be abused.
@_date: 2013-04-20 13:22:07
Good point. The very fresh idea is that  
the very nature of the bitcoin market blurs boundaries  
 for good between a consumer and a merchant, as ultimately  
anyone can be a private bank on its own and should be.

now you are trying to say that being greedy is a human nature. it's not.

This thread is essential for the bitcoin community.  
But this is not only about futures but options as well..
In fact there's no viable derivative market to date.  
Mpex isn't for everyone and Icbit messed everything up.
At the same time free public access to the derivatives trading  
like fut and opt is a paramount factor affecting market stability in general.  
As derivative contracts act as a neg feedback loop in the financial system,  
redistributing risk and influencing the spot mkt in a profound way.
To my mind it's a single unified market. Spot/Fut/Opt.  
Must be p2p/decentralized by the very design.

what's the best source explaining the concept out there?
@_date: 2013-08-31 21:16:47
here it is directly and explicitly defined.. the spread can't be lower than trading fees..  
the interxchange spread is caused by inefficient and corrupted banking cartels/system..
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:41:29

It isn't about "calculating your profit". It's all about hedging man..  
Anyway vast majority will always be loosing all their money in the market no matter what..  
So ephemeral profits calcs shouldn't be the main point of concern, at least for the exch clients..
That means the usd fee value would constantly fluctuate, affecting hedge ratio all the time.  
This stuff is called dynamic hedging, when the hedger has to constantly readjust his market position..  
Which is nearly impossible on the icbit because of very high fees, so now we have to deal in the spot again..
The dynamic hedging is only applicable in options market, where non linear math is in place..  
While opportunities for the dyn hedging have always been limited by the broker/exch commissions..

talent is a value, idea.. new business models would emerge.. it's time actually..
no taxes though, we can stand the violent fiscal policy no longer..  
why on earth would f criminal gov should have such advantage  
over other free spirits, it's not possible to comprehend..

In general yes, i agree. But they bound to obey intrinsic laws of their own financial system.  
Hmm it might be otherwise if the financial system itself reach a sort of evolutionary bifurcation point.  
When old rules and laws break down and become no longer applicable. A shift in the universe.
