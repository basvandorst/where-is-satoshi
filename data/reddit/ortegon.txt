Thank you, it's been clarified!
3. Want to know about some minimal amount - will it be possible to participate with 1 or with 10 btc, will it matter?

I don't understand why nobody says me about platforms like Havelock investement, Cryptostocks and so on... So such opportunity exists!
Maybe someone will see this tread later.

Havelock! That's what I really looked for!
Recently I was interested in Crowdfunding like Fundersclub and thought that such investment is only for accredited investors.
Thank you, I'll explore it!

BTC, XRP and so on are already bought)) For a while I believed that I can get shares in companies....
But just to know: funds like AngelList get number of little amounts of money from investors and then give it to second fund, that will be the only investor (as I understood). But what about the invesotrs, they will have shares of the second fund, not in the startup? And if the IPO will happen, could they somehow sell their shares in the startupn?
Sorry for my engllish)

Which one?

So you can easily loose your "shares" like deposites on MtGox?)

Ofcourse I meant just 1Robert=)
But the question is about possibility of giving privkey with no need in trust. For example he isn't friend of mine, so is threre any way for him to make sure that once generated privkey for him (on my more powerful GPU for example) I can't use it in the future?

Thank you! Quite difficult for me, but that's what I wanted to know.
@_date: 2014-08-27 09:58:18
Do you mean multisignature "to generate two numbers" - are they 2 private keys?
And how 3d person could generate requiered address without full private key?
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:20:25
Yes, it's clear. But it's gonna be a new kind of investment without brokerage system and it's great!
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:58:24
So shares in such cases - are someway-called balances on a site? For example on my account on BTC-TC I've got 100 ASICMINER-shares?
Sorry, what is ASX?)

What about fees? Yout think we should expect their decreasing? If there will be more transactions it doesn't garantie lower fees. And now there is no problem with number of transaction so such pools of transactions can be used, I think (max is 7 transactions per second as far as I know, not 3). It can become a problem when there will be more bitcoin users.
I can't believe there are no such topics in the comunity, because of only with-3rd-party possibility of micropayments.

You mean 1mb block size or fee size, that doesn't depend on sending amount?
