Ok, so basically if I buy $100 worth of Bitcoin its basically like a stock almost in that it fluctuates in value?

Wow thanks. I saved this to read later.

Its regulated now? I did not know this. What is this auction?

Ok, I figured. I just wanted to ask and this place is pretty helpful. Sorry if it was a dumb question!

So lets say I deposit a few hundred dollars. Can I withdraw it whenever I want?

Kind of crappy to buy bad gifts for your family but not yourself man.

Ok so I bought 1 bitcoin and now I am waiting for it to actually purchase. I downloaded Breadwallet. Once it does, how do I get my money from Coinbase into Breadwallet?

Ok, so once my purchase clears in a few days I would go into Coinbase and send the money to my Breadwallet?

Thanks. I am giving everyone here +1. You guys are awesome. This is the most help I have ever had on Reddit. I just bought 1 whole bitcoin to start and set up reoccurring purchases each month. This should be a good investment with my Roth IRA and stocks each month :D

Thanks I will! This seems like a fun way to save a little on the side in small increments in addition to regular savings.

So I just noticed Coinbase has a wallet app. I am just going to use that since I can directly access my Coinbase account. I am saving this money as a "super duper emergency" fund. I save real cash for a real emergency. This is just my "let it save and have fun with" pot :) but yeah, I realized what you just said was stupid of me haha.
