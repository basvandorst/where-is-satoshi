But, how could Bitcoin scale without LN (or with a centralized/censored LN)? I know technologies like Schnorr may save up more space on the blockchain, but these tech doesn't seem to scale significantly. There are many people like me expecting LN to scale Bitcoin exponentially.

"Each byte of the witness part of a segregated witness (segwit) transaction will only count as 0.25 bytes towards the size of the transaction. Since transaction fees are based on the size of a transaction, this is effectively a 75% discount on fees for that part of a transaction—but only for people who use segwit."

I've tried LN on testnet with Eclair. To be honest, I don't think LN is ready for production for now. The Eclair LN node attempted to map the entire network's topology - so, what if the network becomes much more complex in the future? There are only less than 2000 channels on the testnet till now, and Eclair took minutes to sync.
BTW, my payment to yalls.org sometimes fail. Fortunately, I didn' see any fund loss.

The "dusts" are usually stored in P2PKH addresses. Will Schnorr sigs bring them back to life, too?

1/ The "solution" is port forwarding, which requires a server which have a public IP address to forward traffic for the user. In other word, it just bypassed the problem, not solving it.
2/ I've done some searching, and I learned that LN is supposed to have some small hubs connecting a lot of users. But, I wonder if there is anything preventing these small hubs growing up to giants.
3/ It's clear that anyone won't be forced to open channel with someone. Even using LN per se is not compulsory.
But, the onchain tx fee rate is high currently. BTW, users usually want stable/supported services. 
Some big blockers then concluded that only "professional LN hub operators" may meet that demand, which may finally give birth to "super LN hub", after that, the govt may have excuse to censor them.
According to such assumption, users who reject govt censorship must overcome problems like high onchain tx fees or lack of merchant support.

It might be hard to tell which factor is the most critical advantage of a smaller block size. The UTXO bloating issue even made a well known big blocker Gavin Andresen worry.
BTW, currently, pruning mode has some inconvenience. After importing private keys/wallet.dat/watch-only addresses or pubkeys, you must redownload the entire blockchain data again to find all historical transactions back, as well as to recalculate correct wallet balance. The idea that importing keys without redownloading gigantic blockchain data (while inevitably abandon retrieving complete transaction history) had been proposed several years ago, ~~but, unfortunately, this idea still hasn't came to reality up to now.~~I'm sorry that I didn't read the release note carefully... Bitcoin Core 0.17 actually has a new experimental RPC command "scantxoutset", which is intended to do this. (though very awkward to use for now)
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:26:15
"getnewaddress" generates a new address (corresponding to a new public/private keypair).
"addwitnessaddress" turns a traditional 1-prefixing P2PKH address into a 3-prefixing P2SH-P2WPKH address, it doesn't generate new address.
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:08:50
Bigger blocks may allow more users, but unlimited block size encourages users to use on-chain transactions without care, so it's expected that more and more users would create countless on-chain transaction, which would obviously bloat the UTXO set.

Creating/loading wallets is **not a feature available from GUI**. Currently this feature is only accessible from JSON-RPC command line.


"scantxoutset" is still **experimental**. This feature is actually not able to update wallet balance to correct value, especially for pruning mode users (who are eager to this feature the most), since this action must be done through "importprunedfunds", and the "importprunedfunds" needs a **"txoutproof"**, which is usually **not available from a pruned node**. However, "scantxoutset" already provides enough information to sign a raw transaction spending related coins.

Selfish mining is known as "25% attack" brought up by Emin Gün Sirer. It has nothing to do with these empty blocks.
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:02:47
Of course you can. Pruning is simply deleting old blockXXXXX.dat, which is usuallly nearly instant, so it shouldn't have too much negative impact on syncing time.
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:07:07
Block size has significant impact on:
1/ IBD (Initial Blockchain Download)
An average PC is still capable to fully validate the whole transaction history of Bitcoin nowadays, whcih enables the trustless way to use Bitcoin.
But, this process usually takes days and nights to complete.
By default, Bitcoin Core skips digital signature validation prior to a hard-coded block hash. A user may turn this off by passing "-assumevalid=0" argument to bitcoind/bitcoin-qt. Although turning this off would slow down the inital sync process in some extent, an average PC is still capable to accomplish this mission.
SegWit also enables the potential to skip downloading&amp;validating digital signatures - this is often trolled by BCH fanboys, but BCH devs are planing more aggressive things, like UTXO commitment and backward syncing, otherwise the inital sync process for a newcomer full node might last forever.
2/ Block propagation
Block propagation is crucial to miners. They are willing to do anything to reduce block propagation delay, otherwise they will be "punished" by higher orphan rate. An extremely long block propagation delay actually prohibits the distributed consensus mechanism of Bitcoin.
Obviously, a bigger block takes longer time to propagate.
There are some techniques (compact block/IBLT/etc) trying to overcome this problem, but difficult corner cases also exist.
3/ UTXO set
The UTXO set (stored in chainstate directory) is intensively accessed by the full node, which makes a significant I/O performance bottleneck.
This issue is usually resolved by caching the UTXO set in RAM, otherwise validating a single block would take an insane period(several minutes).
Maybe future technologies like NVMe SSDs will resolve this, but a bigger UTXO set still results in slower validation performance in general.
4/ Miner revenue and network security
Small blocks are expected to drive the on-chain tx fees up, which seems awful to some users, but, this will compensate the halvened block reward, incentivising the miners to maintain a secure hashrate.
Off-chain solutions like Lightning Network will take care of "low value" coffee transactions. The main Bitcoin blockchain is both costly and set-in-stone secure.

1/ Native SegWit address starts with "bc1", including two types: native P2WPKH and P2WSH. P2WSH could be used for multisig wallets, just like P2SH.
2/ P2SH address starts with "3", it might be a "encapsulated" SegWit address (P2SH-P2WPKH or P2SH-P2WSH), or not (eg. traditional multisig).
In other word, a P2SH-SegWit address is not distinguishable with traditional P2SH-multisig addresses, until it's spent.
3/ You can check the input script with block explorers like BitFlyer's ChainFlyer, spending bitcoins stored in any SegWit address would have a "Witness" field.

Plain text still can be used to defraud the user. Electrum client connects to electrum servers, not Bitcoin Core full nodes(which lacks some indexing functionality). The Electrum devs have fixed this problem by receiving an error code from the server first, then looking up the corresponding error message locally, instead of receiving error messages directly from the server.
@_date: 2019-02-04 07:48:15
At least you should never expose the RPC port to untrusted network (e.g. the public internet/guest wifi hotspot/public VPN client or server), otherwise the funds stored in Core/LND could be stolen. An extra-strong password is also recommended for RPC authentication, if you may browse some random untrusted websites with your Pi (this is out of paranoia, because modern browsers have CORS support already)
Theoretically your node is possible to be targeted from various attacks, the worst thing is a 0day RCE vulnerability which enables the hacker to take full control of your Pi, but I have never learned that such thing once happened. The devs are also extra cautious about security stuff.
@_date: 2019-02-10 04:56:09

bootstrap.dat is trustless, since the full node will still validate it &amp; find for longer blockchain on the network. But, chainstate (UTXO) isn't, the user must trust the provider that he didn't sneak sth malicious into it.

Your computer could be hacked, then the hacker would gain full control of it, that's why hardware wallets exist. The hacker may hijack your wallet software to replace the recipient address and amount, so that he could steal your coins. Hardware wallet prevents this by displaying the transaction details on it's own screen and letting you to authenticate the transaction by pressing its own button.
@_date: 2019-02-11 07:37:09
Syncing requires a large amount of RAM. Enlarging database cache to \~6GB should be enough for avoiding slow disk I/O. There's also a dirty trick: put the chainstate subdirectory into RAMDisk (like ImDisk), use a NTFS junction to redirect the original chainstate path to the RAMDisk, then restart the syncing process. 4GB should be enough for this, but this trick seems to be slower than simply enlarging database cache.

This still doesn't solve the problem completely, since vulnerable electrum won't see the "white hat phishing" if it chooses an evil server initially.

Currently, AFAIK, a table (a payment channel) only allows two persons to sit around. You pass some cards placed on table A to Bob, while Bob pass some other cards placed on table B to Carol.

No, it won't stuck. It will simply fail, after several rounds of probes/attempts. AMP (a WIP tech) could improve this by combining local balances of multiple channels.


Payment channels. A payment channel looks like an ordinary 2of2 multisig address, but both participating parties hold their own unboradcasted transactions, which can be broadcasted whenever something goes wrong, like cheating penalty/unilateral force-closing.


There's actually no unified "deposit balance" in LN, although a LN wallet could simply add up local balances of all existing channels together. Different channel has different counterparty, thus they have different liquidity or "reachable ranges". However, a wallet could try to rebalance its channels (by on-chain operations like splicing) to circumvent such problem.


It's hard to say. Some hype might arise, but LN should be able to improve usability of Bitcoin in general after all. [Bitcoin is highly speculative.](

If most users must rely on trusted 3rd party, what's the point to use Bitcoin or LN, instead of the existing banking system?
@_date: 2019-01-08 02:41:48
If you want to have a try with LN, you could install **Eclair wallet for Android**, which is quite simple to use. You can find some popular services accepting LN on [
**LN is an off-chain scaling techology.** It consists of many payment channels. A payment channel looks like ordinary 2of2 multisig address, but it's much more than that, because both parties hold some unbroadcasted transactions which could be broadcasted to the bitcoin network in case of misbehavior (like stealing spent funds back).
Therefore, currently **LN requires the user to keep online, at least every now and then**, in order to watch potential cheating transaction broadcasted to the bitcoin network by a malicious counterparty. If the user is unable to run his own LN node to do that, there must be someone else to do so instead, such technology is under development, which is called "watchtower".
Furthermore, since HTLC requires that all participating parties must negotiate with each other to complete each payment, **it's impossible to receive LN payment offline** \- ~~except for custodial wallets~~ this is true even for custodial wallets (although such service could free their users from maintaining LN nodes), because the provider of such custodial service still has to run his LN node &amp; keep it online, which is not the case with ordinary on-chain transactions. In addtition, custodial services provided by 3rd party are obviously against the trustless/decentralizaion idea of bitcoin.
For example, if you want to pay Walmart, you could open a channel with them directly. Once the channel setup is complete, you and Walmart could repartition the funds stored in the 2of2 multisig address, which is equivalent to sending funds back and forth. But, this is obviously quite limited, because a single channel only enables two related party to transact with each other, in other words, the fund is in fact locked in that 2of2 multisig address. Techniques like splicing may relieve such limitation, but you must do on-chain transactions to take your funds out of a channel, which doesn't meet the idea of off-chain scaling.
The core idea of LN is that a payment could be "routed" through a series of payment channels, therefore the limitations mentioned above could be circumvented. HTLC ensures that the relaying nodes along the path cannot cheat, otherwise they would be penalized. For example, If Bob has some spare bitcoins, he could use these bitcoins to open payment channels with some popular businesses, like Starbucks, McDonald's, whatever. After that, you could simply open a channel with Bob, then Bob will use his spare bitcoins which are already deposited in the payment channels to "route" payments for you. In more detail, while making a payment, your wallet software would have some negotiation with both Bob and Starbucks first, which ensures both you and Bob cannot cheat against each other. After that, Bob first pays Starbucks with some of his spare bitcoins with confidence, you then pay Bob the price of a cup of coffee+a little bit routing fee.

All BTC lightning transactions are in fact bitcoin transactions, which could be broadcasted to the bitcoin network any time - but you don't have to do that except there is something wrong, like unilateral force-closing of a channel.

@_date: 2018-07-15 15:07:58
Maybe not. Most nodes discard transactions paying a fee lower than 1 sat/B, so you may fail to broadcast the tx. Even if the tx is successfully broadcasted, it's still unlikely to be accepted by miners.

1/ "SegWit can't scale"
SegWit will never raise the block size limit significantly(current avg. block size is about 1.1MB, even if SW is 100% adopted, the block size is still limited to lower than 4MB). Schnorr may help save some bytes, but the overall on-chain TPS performance still sucks.
2/ "SegWit can't decrease fees"
Yes, it can, slightly. Currently, the market is much more calmed down, so the demand for block space is greatly relieved - but this situation may not last forever.
As for LN, AFAIK, LN is only for micropayments.
BTW, don't forget the full-block fee market policy and the "champagne".
3/ "SegWit is anyone-can-spend"
No, it's not.
But, how could we upgrade the protocol without miner's cooperation? UASF is very controversial.

You may try this to accelerate the syncing progress: move the "chainstate" (as well as the "blocks/index" subdirectory, if you enabled txindex) directory to SSD, by creating a symbolic link (or "NTFS junction" for Windows).
@_date: 2019-09-26 02:18:38
I once heard that a flawed implementation of BIP70 could allow a malicious payee to capture signed transaction, then the malicious payee could defraud the payer by tricking him into thinking the payment was unsuccessful/canceled, while the payment transaction was actually broadcasted.
To me this issue doesn't seem to be very serious. A malicious merchant always has countless ways to defraud their customers. Also, it seems that this issue can be easily fixed in the wallet app used by the payer, by simply notifying the payer that the transaction is already sent out even if the server responded "there's something wrong".
As for privacy, I once heard that BitPay refused to process payments if the payer was connecting through Tor - however, this didn't seem to be a problem of BIP70 itself, since BitPay or any other online merchants/payment processors can always reject customers connecting through Tor, with or without BIP70.
I'm really concerned that whether BIP70 could leak privacy informations such as transaction history/addresses/labels/etc. I wonder if BIP70 has problems like that?
