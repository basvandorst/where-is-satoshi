Interesting idea.
Let's say I'm a customer of good standing, staying at a 5* hotel, in a large city, and I ask the concierge to take care of $70M of fine jewellery. I imagine they would sort out a safety deposit box at a bank etc etc for me. It would probably cost me a fair few $ for the privilege, but it would be safe. I expect they do this surprisingly often.
Just speculation mind. Can't say I've tried this ;)

Well bear in mind that private wallets don't need to be online all the time, and so on, so it's not an entirely fair comparison.
Still you're right. Most people's private wallets are less secure than exchanges. Fortunately most people don't have $60 million in them so hackers aren't as incentivised to attack them. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:11:20
So you're saying that a data-centric company would be insane to fix a data breach? Can you explain why Sony (etc etc) ever admitted to big data breaches then?
I know it's nice to take shots at cloudflare (and presumably AWS, or any other cloud solution on the chain that you can't see) but they are likely to already have security measures in place that prevent a single insider from hacking them. If this turns out to be an insider operation it's far more likely to come from within Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:36:46
The CFTC wanted bitcoin to hold customer deposits in customer accounts. It's not obvious that these couldn't be held offline / in cold storage.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:11:19
I'm not sure what more to say. I know in the relatively small world of this seems like a huge loss - but the fact is that Cloudflare have more to lose than BitFinex from a data breach, and have more people to work on security. Therefore it's reasonable to say Cloudflare's security is better than BitFinex's. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:46:30
Well one downside is that it would take 24 hours to withdraw from exchanges
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:43:15
Still it's not a bad thing. I would be interested to know if it was part of the attack.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:10:51
How is less people wanting to make transactions a win though?
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:41:27
Believe it or not, Cloudflare is valued at ~1Bn+. If this turns out to be a cloudflare breach or inside job it would likely cost Cloutflare more than the $60 mm than it cost Bitfinex.
I'm willing to bet this wasn't a breach on the cloudflare side.

That's a rather revisionist view. Bitcoin Cash is a reaction by some against segwit. Although it executed before segwit, the segwit fork had been agreed to before Bitcoin Cash forked - so it's not unreasonable to say that the segwit fork (or more strictly the segwit debate) was a big factor in the creation of the Bitcoin Cash fork.
*Edit* To be clear, I disagree with the report suggesting that BCH is not a fork - of course it is [though if you want to pedant hard, so is BTC as we know it]. However in response to it is fair to say the segwit fork in part caused the BCH fork.
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:18:02
I mean the analogy is very laboured. Fibre is applying more bandwidth, replacing POTS with smarter systems and better routing is closer to what Lightning brings us.
The internet needed both to grow.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:48:58
Right exactly! Also things are more fluid than that. It's not just txns in the mempool - there should also be txns that people didn't bother to place because fees were too high that they will be placing now.

Ok I'm going to play devil's advocate on a few points:


Short term trends are weak - though sustainable I guess. You'd expect to see an S-curve of adoption and I don't feel we've seen that yet - any idea why?


Yes - but not because of segwit adoption. This surely means less people want to transact bitcoin?


Localbitcoin charges 1% fees (on top of whatever spread the counterparty uses) and is a real pain to use. If LocalBitcoin is increasing then it's a sign that other options are /not/ growing. Possibly because the oppressive regulatory environment is preventing businesses from opening easy to use exchanges?
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:33:49
That's a bit of a straw man - I don't recall anyone suggesting we stop doing research. Got any sources?
There's lots of shit talking on both sides. The blockstream accusations are ridiculous - but so is this idea that if we can bitcoin cash the wrong name we somehow achieve something constitutive.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:39:49
An ICO is a tradable digital token issued by a private group that promises the bearer some future benefit.
A government bond is a tradable digital token issued by the government that promises the bearer some future benefit (coupons / repayment).
The government tokens are traded on a private network and have some restrictions about who exactly can trade them. Apart from that they are pretty similar.
[You can debate about what exactly the bond coupon is - but at its most basic level it's a voucher that can be used to pay future taxes. A forward thinking government could easily make this coupon itself a crypto token]
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:51:38
I believe it's research-and-development rather than a serious proposal at this stage. Such research should be considered a good thing for cryptos in general. Even if you're a proponent of off-chain scaling you can use evidence from such research to defend / challenge your position.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:07:46
I know lazy memes sometimes get blindly up voted here - but the scaling debate is to do with bandwidth and storage not processing power, so this meme makes no sense at all.
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:07:58
I'm not saying they are wrong for charging for their service. I'm just pointing out that the marketing as a whole is failing - by not providing better options - even if local Bitcoins is doing ok.

Big blocks are good when it's segwit, but bad when it's Bitcoin Cash. Also we have to pretend that 2mb is negligible and can done trivially, but 8mb is a humongous and unrealistic upgrade.
It's not that hard. Stick with the script already.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:34:30
Not quite - his argument is that if you think there's utility in Bitcoin you should invest in Bitpay / Blockstream / R3 etc.
He has a point.

One of the best things about Lightning is that it works across cryptocurrencies. This is great for everyone surely?
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:11:48
Lightning fees /may/ be minimal, but the on-chain transaction fees are significant! 
I agree though - if somehow transactions fees become minimal again then we won't care about node reputation. But then in that world we wouldn't need lightning in the first place ;)
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:11:13
This isn't a win - it's a sign that less people are using bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:09:40
Sure - but my point is that you probably won't do this. You are far more likely to only connect to hubs that you trust not to screw with you in the first place. After this the exact terms of anti-fraud periods don't matter much.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:50:45
I think it was more that the previous high was an anomaly - possibly someone was doing heavy segwit testing. I don't think it's the case that segwit was abandoned or anything like that.
It's very hard to come up with good data here though.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:19:31
I'm not saying the network is good or bad - I'm just trying to improve the metric.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:55:08
Arguably all that matters is transactions-per-second, or outputs-spent-per-second. This measure the capacity of the network. Ultimately the number of transactions is what matters - not whether anything is segwit or not (though of course if people use segwit it should be possible to support more transactions).
If you're a pessimistic-small-blocker you might also want to look at megabytes-per-day or similar as this might offer indications to Bitcoins long-term scalability. I'd argue this was a secondary metric though.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:16:16
Right - but most of these CPU benefits apply equally to Bitcoin Cash (and litecoin for that matter). They are of course great achievement - but not relevant to the BTC / BCH debate.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:52:40
I'm not sure I follow - what concern am I disingenuously expressing here? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:28:15
I trust cryptography - but it solves a different problem to decentralisation.
Take for example Telegram - it's currently being used to organise protests in Iran. It's cryptographically secure so the authorities can't identify specific users. However it's centralised so authorities can simply block the entire service. Cryptography and decentralisation are solving different problems! 
It's the same with lightning. The cryptography means my funds don't get stolen, but the decentralisation is important too so that I'm free to use the network however I want.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:38:37
Lightning nodes require you to have an online hot wallet. Opening them on the test net is of course fine, but you must think carefully about the risks of running a mainnet node.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:42:53
True. I guess you could argue that a Bitcoin&lt;-&gt;fiat trader is the most primitive layer-2 solution, especially if you have an account with her or similar. The credit card version is far more versatile than that though.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:25:46
I agree - all these things are tractable problems. But any one of them could turn out to be a weeks work. There are no doubt other things I've not thought of. 
Major participants have a lot to lose if they screw up any of these things, and little to gain. It's classic tragedy-of-the-commons stuff.

Err bch has been going for less than a year.
I'm not aware of any BCH bugs - unless you're counting the adaptive difficulty algorithm?
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:01:43
Ok - well in that case we need to somehow weigh the routing nodes by the number of users they each have connected. If there are 1000 nodes in a perfectly connected graph, but only two of them have other users then basically it is a 2-hub network with some backup routes.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:02:50
Bitcoin Cash is only toxic to certain bitcoiners. The vast majority of people either don't care for any cryptos, or view bitcoin cash as no different to any other altcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:22:41
Ok let me try again:
**Coinbase's poor transaction execution had no effect on bitcoin because bitcoin is resilient:** In which case, why are we even talking about it? It had no effect right?
**Coinbase was able to damage bitcoin because they maliciously handled transactions badly:** In which case Bitcoin is *not* resilient. If a small company like Coinbase was able to create a damaging fee surge for Bitcoin (even if it 'only' lasted a month) then bitcoin has a problem. Bitcoin needs to be able to withstand bigger 'attacks' than coinbase could ever muster.
Which is it?
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:47:08
The analogy here would be doing something to disrupt the entire system - not just one guy!
Ironically bitcoin is quite resilient to attacking a single entity. Alas it's the entire system that's creaking at the seams right now!
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:01:40
There's *very* little difference between lightning and a bitcoin credit card. Lightning removes /some/ intermediary risk - but then visa removes some counterparty risk. Apart from that they work the same way.
The key point is that *I* am using Bitcoin. The fact that the counterparties are using USD is of *absolutely no concern* to me. Why should I care if they use USD or Russian Roubles or even Ethereum? As long as I'm using bitcoin to transact I'm happy.
Think about it - if a merchant "accepts" bitcoin using Bitpay and immediately converts that to USD do you consider that as accepting Bitcoin? Of course you do. Why is the bitcoin credit card any different?
At some point I fully expect certain merchants to close the circle and accept Bitcoin - though currently I'm not sure what would entice them. It used to be lower fees, but that doesn't apply any more :/
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:38:10
I think you miss my point. Yes of transactions per day did not decline. It's still close to maxium.
If fees are $20 a whole bunch of people aren't going to transact with bitcoin because of the price. As fees come down you can expect people to start transacting again. So the number of transactions will stay at the high level for a while.
What we might see eventually is that this backlog of transactions not in the mempool will clear, and we will see emptier blocks - i.e. less transactions per day.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:43:17
Here's a thought - do you need to understand how cryptos work to understand the economics behind them? I don't think you do. He understands that cryptos are easy(ish) to store and transact and are in limited supply. What more do you need to know?

@_date: 2018-01-07 07:27:01

Yeah counter party risk is a concern - I wouldn't put *all* my bitcoins into a credit card like this for sure! :D
Still I want to use my bitcoins and I don't want to be slaughtered by fees. What other options do I have?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:48:46
Exactly - It's a cross-currency 2nd-layer solution!
I mean the whole point of Bitcoin is to use it for financial transactions - right?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:02:48
I'm not disputing that. I'm just saying in response to point that it's fair to say that the segwit fork (at least in part) caused the BCH fork - even though it came in to effect after the BCH fork.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:45:05
Sure - I mean it's not the best layer-2 solution, I agree. But the long term goal is to surely transact with your Bitcoins? The advantage of this layer 2 solution is that it does actually exist and work and you can transact with it today. 
Well - you could use it yesterday at least :'(
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:17:10
It's a layer-2 solution. If you use one of these cards you only pay transaction fees to load and unload, not for each transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:44:39
Some Bitcoin Cash guys are considering fixing malleability. Chances are a working lightning network would incentivise them to deliver this fix. Watch this space :)
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:19:32
So are we saying lighting is centralised but that's ok? That's a bold move for bitcoin :s
... I'm not saying pow is without risks, but we just had a massive war on blocksizes in order to remain as decentralised as possible. Seems crazy to say that we're cool with layer 2 being centralised because &lt;cryptography&gt;!
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:15:12
Hmm, I think most people are referring to investment / retail banks.
Still even central banks can function in a crypto world just fine. Government bonds are effectively the same as an ICO.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:31:18
Hmm I think they have other concerns too - but regardless of what you think of bitcoin cash, high fees are a valid concern for Bitcoin - as is a decline in demand. Both of these are things bitcoiners should be worried about - at least a little.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:15:02


Ok so when C collects the payment it means B can collect his payment. But what if C never collects? Does that mean the A-&gt;B payment is locked up forever?


How so exactly? Does this mean that if a node goes down at the wrong time I need to close the channel and let everything resolve that way?


Hmm - I'm not sure I'd be happy with my channels being closed because some 3rd party payment doesn't get routed. I guess this means that you'd want to take precautions about who you open channels with in the first place. Would this be a centralisation pressure?
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:47:30
Here people like anyone who says the price will go up ;)
BitcoinMarkets people at least entertain discussions about downward trends, even if they don't like them!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:53:25
I think it can. We want people to adopt bitcoin - for this to work we need high demand and low fees.
So (for example) lower fees are good if people move to segwit, but bad if people stop using bitcoin. Pretty simple?
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:54:08
You're going to claim that 90% of users are stupid? Another bold claim I'd say. 
Far more likely is that the costs of using segwit (mostly in terms of usability) are too high.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:40:50
Right. But to get the arithmetic to fail you have to make assumptions about the future cost of bandwith and storage - which you cannot possibly know. You also have to invent non-technical constraints on centralisation which cannot be measured.
Depending on the predictions of growth and cost that you use, and your choice of un-scientific decentralisation constraints - the arithmetic will "prove" that bitcoin can / cannot scale.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:14:36
More like is creating a narrative that coinbase is single handedly breaking bitcoin for nefarious reasons. This fails any common-sense test since Coinbase is heavily invested in the success of Bitcoin (even if they don't believe in it themselves). A *far* more rational explanation has been provided by below: "Legacy code... It's a bitch"
Besistes if it's true that one company can break bitcoin then Bitcoin has a problem - not that company!!
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:03:14
Why would I, as an individual, chose to connect to a "highly connected node" rather than a "massively connected hub"?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:29:05
Bitcoin was maxed out with transactions - so a decline in Bitcoin fees / mem pool absolutely is a reduction in bitcoin demand!
If it's sustained then eventually we'll see a reduction in transaction volumes.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:12:14


Well segwit didn't lower fees, and adoption is pretty low. We should assume lightning will be similar - right?


Did you see what happened to segwit2x? !!!




Sorry - you can only pick one of these.


Right! Exactly! Because **you're incentivised to trust your node!!** That's my point!
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:24:23
But someone needs to plan the valid route - that person will need to know the start and end, and the layout of the network. Who is going to perform the routing?
Also what happens if part way through the routing stages one of the links fails? How is it possible to ensure that the link is either atomically completed or atomically fails?
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:54:20

@_date: 2018-01-09 14:57:25
That "trustlessness" comes at a cost - specifically it costs $60 to operate a channel in netowrk fees. Also in you need to monitor the network every *x* hours and in the event of the node disappearing you will need to wait *x* days to recover your funds.
This is low-trust, but not trust-less. Most would rather not have to deal with the hassle of bad channels, so they will prefer nodes with good reputations.
Think of it like a credit card - in principle it's free to open up a new account with a new credit card provider. In practice it takes several hours of your time to gather the forms and document together, plus there might be some small charges. This is why most people only have a couple of credit cards.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:01:35
Hmm - adding hops wouldn't increase privacy directly since you still need to broadcast your final destination. 
You could do onion routing like tor does, but an extra hop between you and the first node wouldn't make much difference there.

There's a myriad of solutions to solve the initial download problem, pruning and the like - or storing an initial blockchain on a DVD! People don't worry about this too much because it's a one-off cost. 
The scary costs are the O(time) costs - which are mostly bandwidth and storage. There is a slight increase in O(time) cost associated with more a larger block size but this is negligible. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:07:44
Bitcoin credit cards are a layer-2 solution. You only pay fees to load / unload. Not for each transaction.

I'm using bitcoins and dollars yes. Not my fault the merchants don't want bitcoins - hopefully that's just a matter of time and when they do my layer 2 solution will adapt.
 Dollars are only ever a currency, in of themselves they don't transact. If someone provides an account where you can convert Bitcoin to dollars and then sends those dollars on to a third party then yes it's a layer 2 solution.
 Does coinbase send dollars to a third party? Thought it had to be back to your account?

@_date: 2018-01-09 17:26:59


? When is this going to happen!
Lightning has lots of benefits - but expecting it to reduce on-chain fees is massively wishful thinking. Bear in mind that segwit was supposed to reduce on-chain fees and that has a measly 10% adoption. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:15:49
Some of the technology still needs to be invented - particularly around routing.
The user experience needs to be worked out. Currently it's complicated, and any transaction involves multiple steps where several parties need to be online.
Security needs to be thought about. Lightning hubs are hot wallets with all the risks that entails. Even a lightning channel has security risks.

Do you have any resources that explain how multi-hop HTLCs work? I just about understand the bi-party case, but I don't see how it can work when you need to hop via an intermediary.
* How do you ensure atomicity - that either the value is transfered A-&gt;B-&gt;C or not at all.
* How do you prevent intermediaries learning information about the payment - in particular the source, the target and the amount.
* Is it possible for a malicious intermediary to agree to participate in a transaction and then keep the funds. Or conversely could a malicious end point claim that an intermediary was not co-operating when in fact they were?
* Are there DDOS vectors whereby intermediaries say they are willing to participate in multi-hop transactions and then subsequently refuse to do so?

Not 24/7 but maybe once a day.
Realistically you'll connect only to respected nodes that have a good track record of not closing channels, so it won't be a day-to-day concern. However I suspect this might become one of the main drivers of lightning node centralisation.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:13:22
Probably worth having a point about "Will the lightning network be centralised / censorable?"
I'm not expert enough to know the answer to this one. However my instinct is that it will be fairly centralised. You need to connect to reliable well-funded well-connected nodes, all of these features will apply centralisation pressure :/.

Segwit isn't required - by design! Neither is batching.

C'mon fixing malleability via a hard fork is pretty simple. It's only hard if you constrain yourself to using soft forks.

@_date: 2018-01-15 09:58:16


That's not exactly fair. Yes the transaction part of segwit isn't too tricky (for someone who already has experience with building bitcoin transactions from scratch).
What about integrating it into your hot wallet? What about your QR codes? What about migrating existing storage? What about rollout to many servers? How will you handle payments in flight as you do this? How are you going to test? Will your users panic if their address format changes? How will you calculate segwit fees? ...
Not saying coinbase (or whomever) shouldn't do this of course - but there's more to upgrading an exchange than building the transactions. You should be wary about extrapolating too much.
It's much safer to assume that the costs of implementing this change outweigh the benefits for them, rather than malice / incompetence on their part.

Execution risk is the risk that the counterparty doesn't follow through with the trade. It's close to 0 for Coinbase. I've not use Bisq, but I know from Localbitcoins that 90% of trades fell through. This was for face-to-face over-the-counter trades.
Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty dissapears with your money. On Localbitcoins I got scammed once, and heard plenty of stories of other scammers. Conversely I lost a bit with MtGox. Hard to say which is worse here ;)
Having said all this, it's a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison. I don't see bisq as a direct competitor to coinbase.

Hence if you believe in the utility of cryptos then invest in the companies behind them. Pretty straight up.
I guess the scenario you describe would occur if Etherium (or whichever) takes over from Bitcoin.

Right - so we could define "bitcoin" to be "every chain that's compatible with Bitcoin-qt 0.8" - but I don't see that this is a particularly useful definition either ;). For example under this definition bitcoin could *never ever* hard fork, even if there was perfect consensus for a fork.

That's a great question!
Economists presume that companies are rational. Instead of thinking "Coinbase are really dumb for not implementing Segwit, it must be costing them fees" they invert the logic "I can see that coinbase are paying extra in fees rather than implement segwit - I know they aren't dumb, there must be a reason for this. Perhaps the cost of implementing that solution is more than the fees lost?".
Economists can actually offer insight in to all sorts of things this way. If you're looking for a resource on how economists think I can recommend [The Undercover Economist]( - or indeed any book / articles by Tim Hartford.

Cryptos sure. But my time is far better spent supporting Litecoin / Bitcoin Cash / etc.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:28:38


This is under the assumption that the supply of transactions is constant?
Presumably though there are people who aren't willing to transact at all in the current environment but would be willing to do so if fees drop? Therefore if fees drop we might see more transactions generated to plug the gap.
I imagine it's very hard to predict the precise results of higher segwit adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:28:21
I remember when this sort of transaction used to work smoothly.  As you've discovered nobody uses bitcoin for retail any more. 
Nowadays you need a layer 2 solution - but the good news is you don't have to wait for Lightning, you can use bitcoin using layer 2 solutions today!
There are a couple of companies that offer this service. You simply open a channel with them, deposit some bitcoin. Whenever you wish to transact you send them a message, they deduct BTC from your account and pay your counterparty with USD.
In order to pay for this service they typically charge a small fee on each transaction, ~3% or so. Also they have to follow local kyc regulations so you'll need to submit id. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:49:50
You're missing the point - the people who use bitcoin to make payments don't have to be the people who believe that it will hold value. Think back to the old Silk Road - plenty of people back then trusted Bitcoin to make payments, even if they didn't care much about it's future value.
This should form a virtuous circle. The more people use it to make payments, the more people will trust its value - and vice versa. The current trend of high fees and merchant de-adoption is a dangerous omen.

@_date: 2017-12-21 14:15:28
Right - this is essentially a take-profit action. Though it can be advantageous from an FX perspective too.
In principle someone could work on the merchant-leg so that they could also receive bitcoin from these layer-2 channels, but then you need to work out if the merchant is on the same layer-2 network as you are and if there's a route available, it's not trivial.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:19:30
My understanding is that you need similar transactions to operate a channel. However I'll reread the paper and check.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:59:22


Not quite - remember I paid to fund the channel (you could also pay to fund the channel too if you want). Once the channel is open the balance can never exceed the $100 I paid (or whatever you pay in on your side). Once this limit is breached we'd need to pay more into the channel to keep it going.
The money used to fund the channel is locked up. When the channel is closed, that money gets distributed appropriately.

Source? 
Two years ago segwit was speculative, it's only been a dead cert since the middle of this year, and it's only been a requirement in the last month or so. I'd wager that few other companies have as much at stake with their bitcoin implementation as Coinbase do. A tiny mistake would cost their entire business model.
I genuinely struggle to see the conspiracy theory here. Are coinbase not supposed to add altcoins? Are they obliged to announce an exact date for each one? It's not even an effective way to pump the altcoin, could totally have gone either way. 
A much better way to pump BCH would be to add it to your platform with no fees (like Bitstamp have) - yet nobody labels that a conspiracy.

Hmm perhaps. The technical differences between them are pretty small so you may be right. Still circlejerking over the terminology still won't help.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:11:57
Fees are $5-$20 currently for a standard transaction.
The amount depends upon how 'busy' the network is and how fast you want the transfer to compete.
The exact fee is chosen and paid for by the seller. A good wallet will show you the fee before you send.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:51:46
It will make nodes more expensive to run, since memory is probably the most expensive hardware component. This will increase centralisation.

If I had to guess I'd say that bitcoin is majority owned by a few early whales, and high net worth / institutional investors. The kinda guys you see here on reddit that post Hodl memes and maybe have a few million dollars in Bitcoin are a tiny proportion of the whole.
My guess is that the former category are likely to make good use of the future product. We shall see.

Hmm. If steam wasn't accepting zero confirm transactions they were doing something wrong though?

Why are companies paying higher fees rather than moving to segwit?
Maybe the cost of segwit integration is higher than the fees they are paying?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:27:28
Right - so the bitcoin price has nothing to do with bitcoin's viability for payments. I don't see why you mentioned it?

Not sure what you mean by L1 when it comes to the internet.

You're unlikely to get an unbiased answer to that question here - so you're best off reading it and drawing your own conclusions. 
If you ask me then as things stand both bitcoin subreddits are pretty terrible ;). is slightly better if you're looking for actual content!
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:23:40
The Bitcoin price has never been stable - it's not a new problem! (though you are right that this is one significant barrier to adoption).
You're still missing the point. Nobody knows if the price will go up or down long term, but as long as the price doesn't move too quickly you can use Bitcoin for payment.
... Or you could if the fees weren't so preventative.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:00:52
Lightning still requires transactions - just less of them.
Whether this is enough to incentivise miners to keep bitcoin secure is an open question. Right now it seems like transactions are in demand so miners should do ok - but who know what the future holds?
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:34:35
You can still tip with other coins. The dream isn't dead it's just moved ;)

@_date: 2017-12-12 21:46:06
Exactly - and nobody is going to claim that Bitcoin Cash is the same as "whatever is compatible with 0.8". It would be pretty stupid to claim this since it's simply impossible to counterfeit Bitcoins.
However some people claim that Bitcoin Cash is the best bitcoin fork (and they may lazily refer to such forks as "bitcoins"). This is not the same as the above claim.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:22:10
Look the guy is crazy and all that - but I still don't want him to be hacked. I certainly wouldn't want to celebrate if it was because it would make me look like an even bigger dick than he is.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:32:52
Right - but my point remains. If your only relationship with Bitcoin is to buy low and sell high you might as well use the futures.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:37:18
You miss my point. High fees will put users off limiting bitcoin's growth / bitcoin would have even more users off it has lower fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:51:22
Right - or (perhaps worse?) a crash to 8k then a gentle decline to 1k
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:07:00
Right indeed. 
Nobody is sure how to solve this problem. The "Big Blockers" think that bitcoin should be allowed to grow in order to accomodate more transactions. The "small blockers" think that bitcoin can never scale long-term, instead "layer 2" soltions need to be invented to plug the gap.
This is exactly why bitcoin split earlier this year when the "big blockers" created the Bitcoin Cash fork.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:59:07
It will work like a credit card. There are a few credit card providers (visa, master card) who are online all the time. Everyone else will just be a credit card user who doesn't need to be online except when they are transferring funds.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:59:11
Yup that's the idea.
Historically people would suggest you practice using small amounts of bitcoin so that you are familiar with the process - but since fees are $5+ this is no longer tenable. You could practice with Litecoin / Bitcoin Cash I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:10:40
Hmm - For example: Ethereum has more transactions than any other cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:06:06
Why not:
Newcomers - it would probably be better to wait for a $6000-$7000 correction before you buy in?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:44:21
What fees will the merchant incur exactly?
I guess it's possible that nodes become so vastly expensive that you have to pay a fee to connect to one - but even then the node won't know which transactions belong to people connected so the node can't charge per transaction. The model would have to be a subscription model.
That's for 800 mb. For 8 mb I can't see nodes needing to charge, it's not so expensive to maintain a 8mb block chain.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:12:03
'wat? That doesn't even make sense. LN has nothing to do with the number of core nodes on the network.
LN isn't some magic fix everything pill!

Hodlers don't spend - that's my point!
If you're in Bitcoin for the utility then yes you need the actual coins. If you're just in it for the $$$ then the futures work fine.

Am I the only one around here who doesn't want to be my own bank? I've got enough things to do with my time without having to worry about securing my funds, maintaining a node, managing forks, etc!
The sooner my regular bank will look after my cryptocurrencies the better.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:12:12
Right - but your source didn't claim what you said it did. You're refusing to use the same definition of 'bitcoin' as the source is using and therefore you're claiming the source is wrong. That's a fallacy.
Bitcoin Cash is not the Bitcoin, but it *is* a bitcoin, in the sense that it's a coin that starts with the genesis block and follows some broad rules as set out in the white paper. Under this definition there are many bitcoins, and we can engage in pointless debates about which is best :D
If you don't wish to label things that start with the Genesis block and follow the rough rules in the white paper as "bitcoins" (which by the way would include Satoshi's original code) that's fine, call them whatever you wish. You can still debate as to which of these such things is the best ;)
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:30:47
Right - by that definition most hodlers are not embracing bitcoin since they never use the bitcoins they hold. By this definition you are correct in saying the banks are not embracing bitcoin - but then neither are most people in this forum :/
One small correction though: It is the bank's clients (the hodlers) who are speculating. The bank is simply providing a way for them to take on the risk. The bank itself is not speculating.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:20:15
You are 100% correct if you assume demand for transactions is unbounded and constraints on blocksize are 0. But then conversely maybe 1Mb is too much? Should we be pushing for 500kb blocks?
Or take a step back - yes you can't do this forever, but you can definitely do 2Mb (segwit), 8mb (Bitcoin Cash), and you could probably go all the way up to ~100Mb (with some tradeoffs granted). Maybe you could establish a market for blocksize somehow? There are *many* solutions! Some might work, some might not.
Case in point - given a 2Mb blockchain where 2% of users run nodes or an 8Mb blockchain where 1.99% of users run nodes - perhaps the tradeoff to 8Mb was worth the decentralisation cost?
What *doesn't* appear to be working is 1-2Mb.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:12:41
Right - but D might know that C does not perform KYC checks, so therefore D refuses all payments from C.
This is how banking works today.

Insightful stuff!
This has been my take as well - the advanced cryptography should be proven on altcoins before we try and bring it into Bitcoin. Things like Monero are amazing projects, but Bitcoin was great because it was simple!
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:14:42
Optimising is hard, I agree. (Though so checkout some of those altcoins with adaptive block sizes - there is Innovation in this space!). 
Still fact remains that high fees are currently making bitcoin more centralised. I would even argue that the centralisation pressure from fees is worse than 8mb blocks ever would have been.

Because of the network effect - same reason why Bitcoin is still the  cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:34:54
Hmm it's every ~3 days, sorry.
My source is [the lightning paper]( - see for example section 3.3.2. Alice can try and close the channel and claim the coins within it for herself but it has a 1000 confirm lock (~7 days). Bob has 7 days in which to prevent the fraud and get the coins back.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:40:47
How do you reach that conclusion? With segwit you can double the throughput, but that's it. It's hard to accurately estimate the effect that will have on fees, but halving seems a reasonable estimate.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:14:55
I'm not sure that it does. Economically speaking it's still the same number of transactions as a BTC standing order, and the cash / bitcoin end up in the same place.
Now if his boss can get some customers to pay in bitcoin, and he uses that bitcoin to pay the salary - *then* we have some economic expansion!
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:01:30
Higher fees also increase centralisation. It's a tradeoff.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:31:40
Higher fees -&gt; less users -&gt; smaller pool of people willing to run nodes

Yes compression has improved a little, but bandwidth requirements have grown a lot. Heck the whole thing about "HD" is that it is higher definition and thus contains more data!
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:41:32
Right - but in the meantime we have a fee problem. 8mb blocks would go a long way to alleviate this in the short term.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:42:16

Also you need to be able to keep your PC and internet uptime to 99.9%+ so I hope you're good at devops.

A LN node will require significant capital to be useful and requires your bitcoin to be kept in an internet connected always-on hot wallet. Unless you're expert at securing your PC I'd advise against running one.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:48:43
Lightning will be a bit like getting a credit card. You manually apply for a credit card (and provide a payment line and supporting documentation), however the banks handle their side automatically. Lightning will be very similar.
More generally LN raises some serious usability questions. Bitcoin usability isn't exactly great and LN makes it many times more complicated. Usability is a massive unresolved hurdle to lightning adoption. Unfortunately it's far too early to say how (or if) these problems will be solved - solutions are likely many years away.

Lots of Bitcoin Cash nodes on Alibaba, less Bitocin nodes run on Alibaba.
Beyond that this is meaningless... Alibaba is a perfectly sane place to run nodes, they (I assume) have multiple data centres so the nodes are decentralised.
Furthermore node count is a poor metric of anything. It's cheap to setup nodes to run anywhere (even for BCH's larger blockchain). You can try to use node count as a metric of popularity or decentralisation, but it's not particularly good for either since it's easily gamed. Any further conclusions are on shaky foundations.

It's a neat idea but it won't work. I've done lots of local bitcoin trades and most fall through for benign reasons.

Imagine I give you $100 and then we setup a tab. When I buy something from you you add to the tab, when I sell you subtract from the tab. 
At any point either of us can close the tab. If we do we get exactly the balance owed to us, nothing more nothing less.
That's a lightning channel. The lightning network assumes a network of these tabs, if I buy from someone else I can add it to my tab with you, and then you can subtract it from your tab with someone else. That's the idea at least!

BitcoinCash is *very* similar to Bitcoin - you can think of these debates as siblings fighting. Fundamentally they are supposed to be the doing the same thing [hence some pointless debates about which is the best 'Bitcoin'].
The key technical differences are that Bitcoin Cash has larger blocks and doesn't support segwit.
The key phillosphical difference is that Bitcoin Cash believes that on-chain scaling is viable, whereas Bitcoin believes that on chain scaling is doomed and layer 2 solutions need to be invented to solve the problem.

Nobody likes spending money unnecessarily. Especially not companies. Presumably therefore the costs of moving to segwit exceed the transaction fees they are paying.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:52:38
Each payment is a conversation since you need to invalidate the previous payment. This means you need to swap signed messages with the operator of the channel. Unlike Bitcoin you can't safely give coins workout cooperation from the counterparty.
The process could probably be automated though - I can't imagine why a counterparty wouldn't automatically cooperate with a transaction that gives them money.

Right - but now we're worried that it's not being adopted enough and that this is harming the network. So perhaps we should review this decision?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:02:24
Right - all futures are side bets on the price if you want to look at it that way.  Most don't physically settle (banks don't lug oil and gold around any more than they move bitcoins).

Yes - any future is in essence a bet on the price of something. By providing a futures market the banks are embracing Bitcoin as much as they embrace any other products. 
This is the same for most commodity asset classes. You didn't think that banks actually lug large amounts of gold / oil / metals around when they trade futures in those products did you now? ;)

Those hubs won't screw you over, but they may refuse to do business with you (perhaps because you don't pass a US based KYC check?).

@_date: 2017-12-18 22:01:11


Yes - but only for the keys to the channel. In the event that those keys were stolen the only person who could benefit is the channel counterparty. (Though for the lightning network it might be possible to further exploit this).
The hub operator is in a much trickier position. If they want to automatically open new channels then yes they are operating a hot wallet, which is very much a security concern.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:33:14
Well I just gave a bunch of reasons why someone may hold BTC but prefer to manage their BTC risk with the futures products. Obviously if they are selling they are not "true" holders, but they can still be "regular" holders who want to hold a bit less.

Ironically your slow downloads in '92 argument is also the pro on-chain-scaling argument!
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:33:40
That's not strictly true - you need to monitor your channel to ensure that your counterparty doesn't try to screw you over. The counterparty risk is small, but it still exists when compared to on-chain transactions - which genuinely do have 0 counterparty risk.
The fact that Lightning doesn't add much extra counterparty risk over Bitcoin is neat, but really just a footnote. Did you ever worry about Visa or Mastercard going bust? Probably not.
The massively innovative step is unfettered payments - Visa &amp; Mastercard wield way too much power when it comes to deciding who you can trade with. If lightning can preserve the freedom of payment that Bitcoin can provide then I don't mind the additional counterparty risk it brings. For this it's critically important that Lightning is decentralised.

It's a metric. But it has problems: 
For example if I suddenly fire up 500k Bitcoin nodes on a single PC would you conclude that Bitcoin has suddenly become more centralised?
Is it better to run 100 nodes on random windows PCs that are poorly connected and up only 90% of the time? Or is it better to run 100 nodes across 5 amazon data centers that have excellent connectivity and are up 99.999% of the time?

Good question.
One reason is anonymity - they may not wish to declare that they own coins, or they may not wish to declare which coins they own (which you kinda have to do by selling).
Another reason is risk - moving coins incurs risk.
It avoids transaction fees.
There may be other reasons too - having said that, I imagine many people would prefer to sell outright, it's certainly simpler.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:45:02
This is pure Fud. You don't have to run your own node to 'be your own bank' because nodes don't police who you send to. So the whole premise is wrong.

Even in the worst case where the only people operating nodes were miners [who are clearly incentivised to run nodes] there's probably enough nodes for bitcoin to function. Yes it's more centralised than today, but it's still functional, and cheaper.
Remember that's the worst case. Realistically some other people will also want to operate nodes, exchanges, payment operators, Large merchants, all of whom benefit from a healthy ecosystem.
Finally it's not a black-and-white thing. Bitcoin can afford to lose some of the $10 node operators and still be functional and healthy. Yes there's a limit, but there's also headroom. Most altcoins operate far less nodes and they do just fine.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:05:20

Oh dear, the whole point of the layered model is you can swap out the lower layers without changing the higher layers.

I'd argue that in the case of a full blockchain, 800Mb will be approximately 800 times more useful than a 1Mb chain (or equivalently 800 times cheaper to use).
The decentralisation arguments are hard to measure. And however you look at it, layer 2 is going to be more centralised than layer 1, so what BCH loses on layer 1 it will win back by leaning less on layer 2. 
Yes blockchains can't scale forever, but conversely they *can* scale more than 2Mb. [I get there are extremes at both ends who argue that they can scale forever, of that 2Mb is too much, but most people accept the reality is in between].

Lightning is only good when you do repeated transactions with the same person. If you regularly trade with Coinbase you could put all your transactions into a lightning channel.  The number of transactions doesn't matter as long as it never exceeds the channel balance and as long as it's always with the same person you can do as many transactions as you like!
For people you don't regularly transact with you need to invent intermediaries (think visa) who will presumably charge a fee for this service.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:25:25
It's describing the transaction you make to open a channel - it's critical to how lightning operates.

Fun fact: you can live off bitcoin using layer 2 solutions today!
There are a couple of companies that offer this service. You simply open a channel with them, deposit some bitcoin. Whenever you wish to transact you send them a message, they deduct BTC from your account and pay your counterparty with USD.
In order to pay for this service they typically charge a small fee on each transaction, ~3% or so. Also they have to follow local kyc regulations so you'll need to submit id. You can open multiple channels but generally one is enough.
I imagine lightning will be very similar to these existing layer 2 solutions.

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash miners are the same miners - so if miners can be influenced then both coins have a problem. (Nodes can only do so much to protect against compromised miners - eventually the lack of 51% hashpower will be a systematic risk).
Conversely there's more than enough honest nodes that even if Alibaba was compromised the networks (Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) would detect and route around this.

Coloured coins are alive and well in the form of the [Omni Platform]( (and no doubt others). They are a "feature" of bitcoin whether you like it or not - if anything you should attribute them to Satoshi.

Not sure what you mean by "sped up" exactly. You can "defrag" fractions of coins into larger coins (in the same way that you can exchange 100 $1 bills for 1 $100 bill). You have to pay extra fees to do this, and wait for the transaction to confirm so there's little point in doing it unless you need to.
You could arbitrage transaction fees this way I guess. Submit your defrag transaction with a really low fee and wait, then future transactions might require less fees when you need them. Might be worth doing if your holdings are incredibly fragmented.

C'mon turning that cryptocurrency debt from paper to a digital asset is a trivial exercise.  
You're hardly addressing the point which is that well run governments can raise debt using pretty much any underlying asset they choose - for the very simple reason that creditors trust them to pay back.
Moving to cryptocurrencies won't (in-of-itself) make the government any better or worse at paying back its debt, and therefore one can reasonably assume they will be able to raise just as much capital as they do today.

It's a fair question - especially those who don't know all the in-jokes...
There's a school of thought that believes that the genius idea in bitcoin isn't necessarily bitcoin itself but rather the technology that it uses. Specifically some or all of: Block chains, proof of work, merkle trees, peer-to-peer networking, and possibly other parts. The argument is that these technologies together provide unique ways of solving various problems - particularly large scale distributed problems where trust is an issue.
Typically advocates work for the private sector and use the term "Blockchain technology". They often try to distance themselves from the underground-pump-dump-hypecycle of bitcoin itself. Concrete applications of blockchain technology (apart from altcoins of course!) are hard to pinpoint, but several banks are definitely researching this area.
Some people here believe this is at best pointless and at worst detrimental to bitcoin itself. They argue that without the cryptocurrency bitcoin is merely a distributed database, and there already better distributed databases out there (such as Mongodb, Redis, even Oracle / MySQL). Some people go as far as to say that this is an attempt to outcompete bitcoin with private bank-sponsored cryptocurrencies through the back door.

The "I" in my post was proverbial. Let's assume that I am the Rederal Reserve banks and that I "want war" [citation needed - central banks have no authority over foreign policy so this seems very nonsensical].
The problem with your argument is that central banks can issue debt in any denomination they want. Including oil / bitcoin. So assuming that I can successfully issue debt in any denomination, I can then pay for whatever I was going to pay for [war, right?].
So your argument then assumes that I can't issue debt in bitcoin. This is non nonsensical. As a counterpoint, many countries in the world issue debt in USD - yet only one currency can actually print USD. Although occasionally this causes problems, generally the sovereign nations that issue USD debt get along just fine.

Bitcoin mining is designed so the most profitable thing to do is to be an honest miner. This way even if every miner is selfish (let's face it, most of them are) the outcome will still be a stronger Bitcoin. So far this has held quite well but it's falling apart a little when it comes to mining centralisation (arguably not that much since there's still every incentive for ghash.io to be honest).
If you need to police miners then this implies that the fundamental contract - that the most profitable thing is to be an honest miner - has failed. Who will pay for this police force? How will you identify the dishonest miners? etc etc. Upon scrutiny you can see this isn't the right way to solve problems.

Their business plan has two parts, one is the payments, the other is the wallet services. They paments are agnostic to bitcoin prices.
The wallet services on the surface of it look like they will expose Neo to price movements. However it's entirely possible to risk manage this by selling options to offset any losses.

I'm pretty sure data retention for banks is the same or worse. For example investment banks need to record conversions, phone calls, etc as well as transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:34:52
Most people believe transaction malleability was the root cause. If this was the case there wouldn't be any obvious evidence on the blockchain since MtGox uses different wallets all the time. If you could gather enough evidence of known MtGox trasnactions you might be able to figure this out forenzically, but it would be a gargantuan effort.
MtGox would certainly have been able to afford to take a significant hit on its hot wallet, but it seems their cold wallet was drained as well. This suggests that they didn't have any mechanisms for accurately monitoring their balance, which is definitely a secondary point of failure.
@_date: 2014-05-28 12:21:16
Nobody here knows what bitstamp's security is like. For all we know their cold wallet is protected by m/n globally distributed shared secrets.
But that's ok, we can all advise bitstamp on how to manage their security better. In particular they need to split into a number of wallets so that armchair reddit security 'experts' can no longer grind their axes.

Well now you get into legalese. The fine would have been levied against the legal entity because that's how the regulators work. It's entirely up to HSBC how to budget for the fine but you can bet they will account it against the department that made the mistake.
Think about my analogy - if my boss spreads the fine equally for my mistake, everyone else will be pissed off. That's not how the bank would operate.


Bonus culture might have many downsides. However it's great at concentrating minds in situations like this. If some department heads lost their bonuses over this that's going to make them think carefuly in future (I assume this was what happened - but I don't have the data and anyway HSBC would not publish something like this so we'll never know either way).

The short answer is that it bloats the blockchain. The long answer is "what data could you possibly want to store there?" - the implication being that generally whatever it is your storing doesn't need to be shared with the world, only with a few specific people.
Actually people are split on this. There's the "this should be discouraged since it bloats a public resource" camp, and then there's the "you can't possibly prevent this so you might as well support it" camp. Currently the former are winning.

You should go study banking 101 - the reason why investment banks exist in the first place is to provide services for managing risks and opportunities with underlying assets. Everything banks do with gold today (futures, options, dividends, etc) they can do with bitcoin tomorrow. If providing services for gold is profitable, why wouldn't it be profitable with bitcoins?


In the bitcoin world yes. Or at least I hope so. But here I'm referring specifically to the global transactions market which banks monopolise and bitcoin challenges. The fees for this will be lower. For other services I agree it's debatable.

I make no claims to solve problems with fiat, or problems where the operator disappears one day. However we already accept these problems. I at least prevent the operator from running an insolvent company or a ponzi scheme. It's no pancea but it's far far better than what we have today.


The obvious option is to have a small pooled hot wallet to cover in-flight trades. Withdrawls might take 10 minutes to clear, but they do on bitstamp anyway. 


No not at all. I've proposed various working models that are hft compatible and still hold the majority of funds in allocated storage.

You've got the problem wrong. The problem you are trying to solve is that there's no easy way for you to convey to someone that you'd like to be paid / you'd like to pay them.
One solution is to write an email "please pay X to address Y", but like you rightly point out that sucks. The biggest risk is that an intermediary could change Y to another address! Anyway sharing addresses like this is terrible from a privacy perspective.

Not much - but then the same could be said about a fiat bank too.
They could easily prove how many bitcoins they hold. However it is quite difficult to prove how much fiat you have (or don't have), and how much bitcoin you owe to customers.
Fiat banks have accountants that supposedly check that they really do have assets to back their debts. Which helps but you must trust the accountant and / or the bank. Bitcoin exchanges could be audited by regular accountants however I'm not aware of any exchanges that do this.

Sure but following a guide does not come with insurance, so it's hardly a fair comparison.
Charging 2% to have a secure insured hot (or warm) wallet that can be used in a corporate setting doesn't sound unreasonable to me.

It's a compelte myth that bitcoin prevents taxation. I don't know about where you are, but in europe most tax is taken from coporate accounts and payroll. Firms are audited by certified accountants and these audits verify that they and their employees are paying the right amount of tax. Nothing would change in a bitcoin world. Small scale tax evasion is easier maybe (the blockchain is not anonymous), but some small scale tax evasion already takes place via cash (and there are mechanisms to detect this too).


Well central banking takes place in fiat, the same currency taxes are paid in and treasury bonds are issued in. Even if every commercial transaction is in BTC, people will still need to pay taxes and lend to the government in fiat, so it's business as usual for the central banks.

Well you're saying you want to only consider BTC as a currency, but then your talk of the price rises makes it sound to me like you actually consider it an investment. You can't have it both ways.
Yes recently bitcoin has been a great investment. It is unlikely to go back to $8 and so remains a good investment. However if you were simply hoping for it to hold steady in value like a currency would then it's a poor choice.
As to what is currency and was is commodity. Really it's splitting economic hairs. Treasury bonds to your or I would be an investment, but an investment bank considers treasury bonds as cash.

The obvious one is that after the block reward halves a few times, miners decide it's a waste of money, and stop mining, causing the difficulty to drop to the point where 51% style attacks are viable.
The nightmare version of this is that a significant subset of miners collude to perform a 51% attack themselves, pulling off a large bitcoin heist (in the form of a double spend vs a casino perhaps?) coupled with insider trading (i.e. betting the market will fall).

Could you provide a breakdown of my balance by HD path / public address? I like to be able to verify my balances. 
Also could you provide an option to display the master public key? Again for external verification.
When I create additional HD wallets are they always on a different seed? Or can I create distinct wallets on the same seed (i.e. new HD branches)?

Well lower fees on remittances - particularly small ones - is a fairly compelling story. If it weren't for banking regulation we could have sub 30 minute 1% remittances between major currencies for any amount up to $10000 tomorrow. That's pretty compelling!
The other compelling story is online purchases. I hate having to sign up and enter my credit card details on every. single. site. Then there's the wretched "verfied by visa" thing complete with it's terrible integration and dubious security. With bitcoin I can scan a QR code and go. No need to enter a single personal detail if I don't want to.


Well sure. I personally think that it's a fallacy to think that widespread adoption is a goal or likely outcome of bitcoin. Even in the most bullish bitcoin scenarios it's not like visa / paypal are going to hang up their hats. One possible outcome is that bitcoin simply forces the existing players into becoming more competative.
Even if bitcoin remains a niche financial product, those niches represent large markets upon which a healthy industry can be built.

Well if you only model bitcoin as a buy-and-hold investment (or get-rich-quick if you are really cynical) then yes it's no surprise.
However the dream of most people here is of a bitcoin economy. If this is to come true then people will use bitcoin that they earn directly from their work to purchase goods and services.

You might argue that you run this risk using their regular website there is a browser plugin that prevents this.

a) It's possible yes. But frankly the easiest thing to do is practice with a $2 BIP38 paper wallet until you are comfortable with the processes.
b) Allegedly yes. Though if you don't understand source code you'll have to trust them on this.
c) It's possible. In fact when you install a keyboard app it warns you about this risk. Suggest you only use the stock keyboard! However remember that the passphrase alone isn't enough to steal your bitcoins!
d) There's no right/wrong answer here. Different risks. BIP38 is probably safer since you need to compromise the piece of paper *and* compromise the phone. With online electrum you need only compromise the PC.
e) If your BIP38 passphrase is too long to easily memorise then you're doing it wrong. However you might want to write it down alongside your will or inside a safe. Give instructions on what the password is for to your next of kin separately.

Sure. To solve micropayments you need to be able to pay 10 cents or less to whoever you like, whenever you like, and have the fees be no more than 5% (1/2 a cent). [My definition]
With the multibit system you can pay whoever you like, and it has low fees. So far so good.
But you can't pefrom a payment whenever you like - you can only do a microtransaction if you also perform a regular transaction (and pay regular fees) at the same time. It's a bit like a bank saying "If you pay $1 banking fees on your $45 phone bill I'll also give 10c to whover you like free of charge!" It's a step in the right direction but it's a long way from (say) sending 10c to someone whenever you like their reddit post.
I'm not saying it's useless. It's a great way of collecting tips for a service, or charitable donations, or even general taxation. But it's not micropayments.

Inflation is a wealth redistribution mechanism, it takes from people who have lots of cash (generally the wealthy) and gives to people who have cash debt (generally the poor). 
Printing money is another wealth redistribution mechanism, it takes from people who have cash, and gives to the government.
Now I won't argue that either of these are perfect - but they do at least provide some wealth redistribution. Bitcoin (and gold) lack this entirely, so you'd expect wealth redistribution to be worse.

List yourself there. There is a small market in India for bitcoins but not many sellers so if you do find someone they will likely be quite keen. Unfortunately since you're relatively remote it might take a while for someone to bite. You could offer bank transfer but you probably don't have a bank account and the chances of being scammed are high.
Also suggest you buy a local SIM card with some data on it (for $15 or so). Many people there use whatsapp.

It's worth noting that generating a new address is sometimes far less effective than you imagine.

There's only a finite amount of idle CPU power in the world (and arguably most of that isn't 'free', someone could be saving on power or heat dissipation costs). Therefore there's a limit. If mining is sufficiently valuable people will build dedicated infrastructure. 
Will we hit that limit? Well who knows - but betting your cryptocurrency's future on there being enough spare CPU kicking around to mine it seems a weak strategy.
It's the same with the ASICs. My phone doesn't have a removable battery, presumably saving ~15 cents of engineering costs on a $300 device. If the market is big enough specialisation *always* wins. It's disingenuous to say otherwise. 
Once again you might be able to craft something that is ASIC resistant in practice - betting that the market for your cryptocurrency will never be big enough to justify building dedicated hardware. But how big is that? You'll never know upfront.

The rough story is that bitcointalk.org solicited donations for running the forum. They received ~6k bitcoins - which was actually a modest amount at the time. 
Now we're in an awkward position. Theymos hasn't got much to show for the money, but equally the forums are still running. People point out that $3 million is enough to commission bespoke forum software - though it baffles me why bitcointalk.org (or anyone) would want this. It's not obvious what alternatives the money should be put towards, nor a fair process for choosing. I imagine that Theymos didn't really want to be a massive project manager either.

Miners already have an incentive to propagate as many transactions as possible - the transaction fee. They also have an incentive to propagate as many blocks as possible - the block reward.  It's simply a case of balancing the two out. Right now the block reward dwarfs the transaction fee, so miners can reasonably give up transaction fees even for a marginal chance of getting in an extra block. 
Lot's of things will adjust this equilibrium:
 - Block reward halving.
 - Users paying larger transaction fees
 - Protocol improvements that mean propagation is faster.
 - General evolution of the network to include more bandwidth

Well for starters you need a copy of the encryted wallet (as well as the passphrase) in order to access the coin. With brainwallets you only need the passphrase. This alone makes it vastly more secure.
Even if you have the encrypted wallet to work with, it's still harder. Brainwallets can be cracked at a rate of millions per second. BIP38 cutting edge brute forcing can be done at the rate of maybe 10-20 per second. (Obviously these numbers scale with the amount of hardware you have)

Well first lets imagine who you are trying to trade with: 
If your counterparty doesn't have an internet connection either then you'll never be able to verify the transaction and so you can't trust each other - you may as well say "I'll pay you when I get back" for all the good your offline signing will do.
If your counterparty does have an internet connection, well that's great, but how are you going to give your signed message to her? There might be a wallet that supports this sort of thing, perhaps by QR code or NFC? But it's pretty specialised - you'll struggle to find anyone comfortable using it
The best option in situations like this is that you have her share her internet with you. Most people are familiar with the concept of letting someone use their WiFi or even setting up a portable hot-spot. From this point you'll have a regular internet connection and can proceed as normal.

Ok so the problem with domain specific stuff is that it's very hard to calculate the entropy involved.

Perhaps your domain of Twilight movie dialog lines [or whatever] *is* secure, it's almost impossible to measure without giving it away - at which point you compromise yourself.

Arguably it is already, but this is all factored in to the current price. Fortunately government regulation doesn't move quickly and bitcoin is very hard to regulate anyway so you can wait-and-see on this one.


Also large buyers cause price bubbles. Yes the price is extremely volatile. Anyone buying bitcoin needs to be aware of this.

Remember also the volume they hold at the exchange is static. If it's 10k the most they can ever lose (if bitcoin goes to 0) is 10k. If they are doing 100k of orders every week and making 1% on all that then the theoretical loss is just a tiny cost of doing business.

No. What matters is how did you generate the passphrase. Lets say you strung 6 long words together, well now your 65^36 is actually 100000^6, a much smaller number! Maybe your scheme is smarter, but chances are it's not as smart as you think.


That's because most people don't get the maths, or they get the maths wrong. Trust me they are a bad idea!
Ultimately you're left with a simple connundrum: Either your passphrase is too complex to remember, so you have to write it down anyway - in which case why not just print out a completely safe random BIP38 password and be done?
Or you can memorise your passphrase, in which case it almost certainly doesn't have enough entropy to be safe. You need something with more entropy - such as a safe random BIP38 encrypted wallet!

BankC has no knowledge of the transfer at all. Why does it need to know?
It helps to ask what exactly did BankA transfer? If it transferred cash or gold in trucks we're good. The other options are US government bonds, or corporate bonds (IOUs) - This is it really, there's no such thing as virtual dollars. US Government bonds are centrally managed by the US so I doubt an Iranian bank could hold them. IOUs from other banks are a bilateral agreement with those banks, so as long as the banks trust each other they can settle USD debts with IOUs. I suspect there is a maximum level of IOU they will tollerate (margin call), after which the banks have to settle with cash or gold in trucks.

The biggest cost is keeping the data secure from hackers / employees / etc. Also many jurisdictions have laws about how to handle private data which you now need to comply with.

Bitcoin core and bitcoin QT is not the easiest wallet to use - it's more a reference implementation. By all means use it, but expect a learning curve.

I think you're missing the point:


Yes - but in order for this to happen, someone has to buy $100 for 75€. That person has more USD and less EUR.


Not really, the equal but opposite transaction has strengthened the US economy by a little bit.
The only exception to all this is if the central bank is one of the participants on the trade. This is rare but happens occasionally (e.g. the Rouble right now). However I'm not aware of any central banks trading bitcoins so it certainly doesn't affect the bitcoin market [yet?].

You don't need to sweep your funds into a wallet provide first, but it's best practice. Most bitcoins have a hotwallet for day to day stuff and a BIP38 wallet for savings. Whenever you wish to spend simply withdraw all your funds from the BIP38 wallet into your hotwallet. Put any remainder that you don't want to save into a new BIP38 wallet.

Europe has recently gone through a period of financing things without using inflation. If you recall the ECB set inflation close to zero even though Spain, Italy, Greece had terrible debts. The solution was a mixture of belt tightening (good) bailouts (bad) and defaults (nasty). Whilst this episode was not Europe's finest hour it demonstrated that the current system can more-or-less function without pushing the inflation button even in extreme circumstances.
And there was certainly no massive libertarian shift. If anything left-leaning governments are now more popular in Europe.

I think there is a valid place in the world for consumer protection, and deposit insurance is one of the most important protections you can have for consumers. The health industry is another great example were consumers need to be protected. For example in countries where basic healthcare is paid via taxation there is a very competitive insurance market for those who want extra cover.
People using bitcoin need to understand that right now it's the wild west, there are no consumer protections - as such right now it's not right for anyone but sophisticated investors and technical experts. The post the OP refers to is wrong in many respects but he's completely valid to draw attention to the fact that there are no protections in bitcoinland and for most people this is a Bad Thing.

Firstly there's the purely pragmatic: Maintaining a connection on wifi can be choppy enough (and subject to all sorts of whimsical firewall policies beyond my control) without having to maintain a Tor circuit.
There are also some technical / theoretical risks: primarily how do you know you're connected to the real bitcoin network and not a malicious simulation? That sort of thing. I'm not going to claim to be an expert in this field but I think you need to consult with the people who are before going down this road.

Ok well the sequence of events for the 51% attack is as follows:
 * 5-6 large miners realise that after the block halving event they will not be competitive.
 * They switch off their mining equipment after the event and wait a couple of weeks for the difficulty to drop.
 * They sell all their equipment on ebay (but don't ship it)
 * They sell their BTC / buy options that the price will fall.
The setup is now complete.
 * Now the miners place bets with satoshidice and start mining in private. If the bet wins they keep the BTC. If the bet loses they try and mine an alt-chain with double spend that invalidates the bet.
 * It will take them a while to succeed (maybe the only have 20% of the network), but they should after a few days.
 * They then try and cause as much publicity as possible saying they have "broken bitcoin" and stolen x thousand dollars.

* The computer you use to generate the encryption must know the private key. So if that computer is 'live' you lost all the benefits of generating the coins offline.
* If you don't destroy your old keys, then there is a chance the unencrypted key will get stolen, and the thief can bypass any encryption.
* There is also no benefit vs generating a clean offline wallet and moving your bitcoins there.
If you're worried about making your coins 'live' again I suggest you do a practice run with $10 of bitcoin. The practice run can be done with coins that where never really offline, just so you can get the drill right.

The BIP38 password doesn't need to be as strong bacuse: a) BIP38 passwords are much more expensive to brute force, b) you can't 'pre-crack' BIP38 wallets and c) the attacker won't have the encrypted wallet. 
Honestly there are unclaimed bounties for 4 and 5 character BIP38 passphrases where the encrypted key is public. A basic passphrase (e.g. 3 random words + your mother's middle name) is sufficient.
Realistically nobody is going to search paper / usb sticks / etc at borders, and if they do you can store them online, or practice basic stenography. There *are* some people who might get searched more rigorously (convicted fellons, high profile dissidents) they would do well to seek expert advice outside of reddit!
Keeping encrypted wallets online isn't /so/ bad either. Sure there are risks, but the sheer cost of brute forcing a BIP38 password puts off most attackers. For maximum security though don't store the public key online so that attackers can't see how much balance there is.

Look at it this way: Some companies **already** insist you provide ID before you do business with them. The obvious ones being bitstamp, coinbase, etc.
Instead of you providing each one of them with your ID, you can instead provide ID to CoinValidation.com and they would validate your ID and your address. You can then use this validated address with bitstamp / coinbase / whoever.
The win for you is that you don't have to wait a week for an ID check to open an account, and only one company has your ID. The win for the company is that they don't need an army of ID checking lawyers.
*Nothing else changes!* The company that required ID still requires ID whether you support coinvalidation or not. You're free to only do business with non-validating entities whether you support coinvalidation or not. The financial authorities can track your transactions with ID registering entities whether you support coinvalidation or not...

A lot of people here like to blame 'whales' for putting up walls that 'manipulate the market'. However nobody has any evidence for this. The theory is that by placing a wall you'll hinder the market from going above / blow a certain level, which sounds great, but of course it still could cross your level, in which case you'll lose bigtime. 
Note that it's reasonable to assume the market suffers from insider trading / manipulation for the simple reason that there are no mechanisms possible to prevent this. However the market has always been this way. There's no reason to believe that it is being manipulated more this week when its going down than it was 3 / 6 / 12 months ago when it was going up.

Alas your anecdote neither proves your passphrases have sufficient entropy nor proves you will be able to accurately recall them in 2/5/10 years time. Since we can't wait that long we'll have to use analytics instead - you're no doubt unwilling to reveal your passphrases anyway ;) 
The basic idea is this: Work out how much entropy a brainwallet needs to have (60 bits? 80 bits?). Do scientific tests with many volunteers and see how good they are at memorizing random phrases over weeks / months. You'll find that they cannot do it, not reliably anyway.
The TL;DR is that whilst it might work for one or two people with great memory skills, you simply cannot recommend this approach to general users. Fortunately we have BIP38 which is much easier to user and designed to be safe by default.

Chances are similar weaknesses exist. There might be an argument that since darkcoin always uses a join mechanism analysis will rapidly become prohibitiviely expensive.
I'm just speculating though. The only way to know is to wait for some decent peer-review of darkcoin to be published. Until then paranoid users should be very suspcious of privacy claims by *anyone*.

Will merchants pass the savings on to the consumer? Well in an efficient market they will otherwise another merchant will take their business. If the market isn't efficient - well there's only so much bitcoin can bring to the table, it's not a panacea for all economic problems.

Strictly it's any asset that appears on the bank's balance sheet.


Not true at all! :) Strictly it only needs to be verified to the banks owners (though regulation demands that other parties require verification too).
You still seem to think that there is some centralised registry of USD deposits. This isn't true! Banks can settle with other banks however they like. As long as the end result is that value of the assets (be it gold, cash, bonds, IOUs) balances with the value of the liabilities (the virtual USD you have in your bank account). You could send electronic USD via some centralised network to make this work (you could even use bitcoin!), or you could put gold in trucks. 
You make this sound fiendishly complex but actually it's actually really simple - possibly the oldest and simplest part of banking. Every day count up the stuff you've got and the stuff you owe. If you owe to much give them some of the stuff you have. If you're owed demand some more stuff. It really is that simple.

* You now pay a merchant for a product / service not send bitcoin to an address. Much safer, particularly from man-in-the-middle and social attacks.

1-3% would slash these fees for sure. However most of the world can't buy or sell bitcoins for 1%.

Oh dear, there's a lot of fluff in all these replies. Alas Bitcoin is just a protocol, not a pancea for society's ills. Switching to bitcoin doesn't actually change very much, and where it does it's very often a double-edged sword.
Let's look at your examples:
**Corruption** - I'm guessing most corruption around the world involves cash, bitcoin is slightly easier to hide than cash so on paper bitcoin would make corruption marginally easier. Converesely bitcoin payments leave a trail of sorts, which might put people off using it. Close call. Either way a healthy judicial system and competative media sector is still the best weapon against corruption.
**Unfair taxation** - Bitcoin doesn't come with a tax policy so it's hard to argue that it has any bearing whatsoever on taxation. Arguably bitcoin makes tax evasion easier, but tax evasion is not new, and it's not clear to me that tax evasion is an effective weapon against unfair taxation anyhow.
**Asset Forfeiture** - Bitcoin isn't going to make your car any more or less forfeit-able. Bitcoins themselves can be protected from forfeiture if you are careful (arguably so can cash and gold, though it's probably easier with bitcoins). You can argue either way as to weather making assets harder to seize is a good thing or not (bad if you don't like drug barons or corrupt politicians, good if you're an innocent citizen unfairly discriminated against by the state).
...and for fun, one you didn't mention:
**Wealth distribution** - One might argue that if society's wealth were more evenly distributed then life would be fairer (as long as your assets aren't being forfeited in order to do this of course!). The main mechanism for this is taxation, but equally inflation helps too. If you remove inflation then arguably it means that wealthy people have an easier time remaining wealthy.
Still the takeaway message should be that bitcoin doesn't come with a taxation policy or much of an economic policy, so on it's own doesn't make much difference. Society's problems still need to be tackled via political and economic solutions just as they have been for the last 200 years or so.

It's not the length that matters, it's how you generate it. Still in my mind it's like asking how thick should a cardboard door needs to be in order to be safe.
Forget brainwallets already. BIP38 is safe by design.
Also BIP38 is great for solving the legacy problem. Print out a copy and put it in your will. Tell your wife your passphrase. The executor of your will can't steal the bitcoins without colluding with your wife.
You can even take it to the next level, e.g. put the passphrase in some kind of electronic dead-mans-switch so that it's only released on your demise, etc etc.

I think Brainwallet uses this library: 
Bitaddress uses window.SecureRandom, is that some sort of built-in thing?
(I'm no javascript expert, are there any in the house to clarify?)
I've not tracked down the underlying random functions. JavaScript's SecureRandom probably has lots of eyes on it so any weaknesses are more likely to be known - if your browser version and java version are uptodate you should be fine. the other library is less well known and the code uses Math.random in a few places which is probably not secure.
Crucially bitaddress.org goes to a lot of trouble to collect entropy when it first starts up (random mouse movements are similar to the diceware idea), so it should be secure even if your platform doesn't have enough entropy.
[Note this is a relatively new feature, if your bitaddress.org wallet is &gt; 1 year old you might not be covered].

Double spending is just a matter of buildling a chain in private that's longer than the public chain. This can be done with any amount of hashing power, but the more you have the more chance you will succeed. Even at 30% hashing power there's a good chance you'll succeed some of the time.
The main mitigating factor is that *failed* attacks are expensive due to wasted hashing power, which is probably why nobody has ever tried it.
At &gt; 50% you are guranteed to succeed - eventually.

You realise the problem is regulation don't you? It's quite easy technically to setup an exchange from BTC into USD, and the margins would be tiny. Unfortunately regulation in the US and elsewhere prevents this from happening.
In the meantime enteprising individuals step into the gap. They take some risk, particularly regulatory, and charge what the market will bear. However it's vastly inneficient to trade this way. In time hopefully regulation will ease and technological solutions will push the dealers out.
In the meantime, attacking the symptoms won't help. Nobody is forced to buy bitcoins via any particular channel. If you want to help everyone we should work on talking to the regulators.

Thanks, that does help clarify. From reading the overview I thought you'd be incoulding a BRIT payment with every transaction. Doing it every x transactions changes things slightly. However it still poses problems:
* A single BRIT payment is enough to taint your wallet as a user of multibit (or probable user)
* Worse the markers will act as a guide to indicate if you are using other wallets. You expect one marker every 15 transactions, if you only see one every 30 transactions then the user probably has another wallet. Adding some randomness would help, but not much.
* Encouraging more people to use BRIT (or even multiple outpus) doesn't help much, the signature of 1 large output + 1 multibit fee every 15 transactions would be a very strong indicator of multibit.
* Anyone can figure out all the multibit payment addresses by querying the BRIT server (it's hashed by wallet creation date which is trivial to iterate over). Worse, you could theoretically backout from the addresses used by BRIT payments to infer the wallet creation date!
Really you need to open this discussion more widely. I'm by no means a statistics expert and I can see several dangers with this plan. It merits it's own discussion and serious peer review.

The 2FA challenge types that people use where the key changes every 30 seconds require a 3rd party to manage them - the service has to hold a private key to verify your token. Same problem with the security question - who will verify the answer is correct?
On top of that you would require a hard fork.  And you're also introducing a concept of time, (bitcoin is currently not really sensitive to timestamps on transactions).
You could reduce it to a simple 1 key for small transactions, 2 keys for large transactions. This might have some value, but many attack vectors would simply yield all keys. It's debatable how much more security this simplistic version adds.

You've posed the question rather badly. Crucially:
* There's no guarantee the price will go up.
* Because you'd rather have a widget now than in 6 months time - even though you know the version in 6 months will be cheaper / better (think iPhones). It's just Human nature to consume like this.
Still inflation is useful since it provides some wealth redistribution, and encourages lending. It also provides a tool for policy makers to adapt the economy to the economic climate (or their own nefarous purposes, depending on who you ask). By comparrason bitcoin is definitly lacking in wealth redistribution, lending possibilities, and economic controls. But then so is gold and that does ok. It's far too early to know if these properties will be significant problems or not.
The other thing missing from this debate is some sense of scale. There's an unimaginably vast casm between bitcoin-as-a-tool-for-commerce / bitcoin-as-an-investment, and a hypothetical bitcoin economy. Bitcoin can function very well for commerce and investment and my never become so significant that it represents a significant proprotion of the economy. In this rather likely scenario the macroeconomic properties of bitcoin really don't matter one jot.

People could adapt scrypt mining hardware to crack bip0038 wallets. Technically if such hashing power was readily available it Would make bip0038 a tiny but less secure.

This is pure conjecture. Bitcoin could have had inbuilt inflation and still have taken off. The innovation is the blockchain more than the economics.


By averting boom/bust cycles, hyperinlfation, and other macroeconomic perils central banks maintain the value of their currency pretty well. You can quibble over whether they always get it right or whether inflation is too much, but your argument that they *never* help is as trite as an argument that they get it right every time.

Let's run with the premise for a bit. Does it matter if the hashrate varies during the day? Not massively I don't think. The net result is that you'd get faster confirms when things are busy (well more profitable) and slower confirms the rest of the time. The average confirm would still have to be 10 minutes, so I don't suppose the variation would matter much.

Most people do misunderstand coinvalidation. They believe it's some sort of vision of a global scheme where some coins are tainted as "good" and some are tainted as "bad". In order to trade good coins you need to submit ID and register etc etc.
Actually it's really just a way of getting a 3rd party to do your KYC checks for you in a secure manner. Basically coinvalidation does the checks for you, signs your public address, then you can go to bitstamp (etc) and they will know that KYC has already been performed. 
**TL;DR** Coinvalidation is not about tainting coins, it's about performing KYC checks for 3rd parties who would do them anyway.

Plenty of people are looking in this space. They often get shot down by the community (because government is bad, anonymity is good mmkay?). 
It should certainly be possible to run a centralised KYC/AML service that people can *optionally* register with in order to verify their identity. You could probably decentralise it if you really wanted (but why?). The main problem is that the regulation is horribly ill-defined, it's not clear to anyone what is sufficient to satisfy the law.

Hmm perhaps it's a definitions problem. I'm sure some specific bank transfer standards might mandate USD transfers go via the US.
However if two foreign banks wish to transfer USD that exists as assets in the bank it's perfectly possible to do so without going via the US. Either by trucks with notes in them, or electronically. Such a transfer might not use an international protocol, and the banks in question will need to work out how they communicate that transfer - but these are minor logistical points.
(And really there isn't that much difference between the electronic transfer and the notes-in-trucks.)

It's more a semantic question. If you 'borrow' the funds to pass the audit, at that point you must be in full cryptographic control of the funds and so you are certifiably bit-solvent.

(Ok 5% specific to equador. Sorry misunderstood.)


Well ok, so it's definitions again. By your definition a USD current account is actually a USD derivative. The only USD that matters is USD as issued by a central bank, either as banknotes, or an online credit note directly to the central bank. By that definition I agree everything is centralized via the FED, but by that definition most people in the US don't hold valid USD cash in their bank accounts.
If you accept that a USD current account is valid USD then it's reasonable to accept that a USD current account with a Russian bank is also valid USD. (Both fractionally reserve, both might choose to back with gold not USD, etc etc). If you accept that these are USD cash then it follows that two foreign banks can bilaterally settle USD without involvement of the FED.

I'm struggling to find the actual paper that describes the weakness, my limited understanding is that it uses the input / output amounts to join the transactions. If you trade 1.3725354823 BTC then yes it's going to be obvious, but if you trade exactly 1 BTC it seems likely that many other people will also have a transaction of the same amount. In which case the analysis won't work, or rather you can claim that someone else happened to also trade 1 BTC at the same time and the analysis is incorrect on this occasion.
Is this about right?

This is a very risky strategy. In step 4 you need to buy up to $100 million (80 - your intended target, plus the 20 you already sold to push the price down).
It strikes me as optimistic to believe you can depress the market with $20 million of sales and then somehow find liquidity to buy $100 million cheaper. Not to mention that you need cash left over to help drive the price back up.
It's just not adding up for me.

Assuming you trust the auditor, and you trust that the auditor has been diligent enough to not use compromsied tools / data when verifying, this proves that they have some bitcoins. 
If a significant proportion of users are pro-active and verify that their own accounts are included in the audit then it also proves that they hold more bitcoins than they owe to users.
They are still at risk of being hacked and they are still able to steal the coins themselves after the audit. It's also possible that they borrowed coins to cover the audit (whatever that means).

Sorry this simply isn't true.
Let's take your 50tn loan example. The bank can't print money. All it can do is print IOUs (or credit notes as they are usually called). It can sell these credit notes on the market and try and raise real cash, but there's no money created from nothing.
There's no reason why the IOUs shouldn't be denominated in bitcoin. Many people today already hold bitcoin IOUs (anyone who leaves BTC at bitstamp, or coinbase).

Well currently if you buy porn online the chances of anyone spotting your transaction are minscule. If your adversory knows you use a particular wallet (and can trivially identify transactions made by that wallet!!) he suddenly has a much reduced search space. 
Another example: If you use an obscure web-browser to view a contravertial forum, at the same time you're a vocal proponent of the same obscure web-browser. People trying to figure out who is using the contravertial forum migth notice the use of the obscure browser and start to track all its proponents. Now on its own it's not incriminating, but it most definitely reduces the attack surface.

Thanks for replying. The worst thing is that **you do not once mention the privacy implications of being paid this way**. Obviuosly you're entitled to take payment however you see fit, and users are free to decide whether to use your software. However it's not fair that you don't fully inform users of the implications of being charged in this manner!
Better for anonanymity would be to randomise when and how much you charge, so that you get paid the same amount on average but only 5% of transactions actually pay the fee. I think you should also offer an upgrade where users can pay you a 1-off fee and never be charged on a per-transaction basis.
Finally, won't this prevent you from supporting offline transactions?

Woah, you're about to enter the world of numerical analysis, it's a strange place. Beware of the maths.
First off: Bitcoin balances are represented as whole numbers of satoshis. When you split 1 BTC into three, two people get 33,333,333 satoshis and one lucky person will get 33,333,334 :)
It's tempting to suggest real fractions of the form A divided-by B (aka quotients) as a way to store balances. However there are problems with this, not least that there are multiple ways of representing certain numbers (1/2 == 2/4 == 4/8 etc) which makes performing even basic comparassons non-trivial. Also since A and B must be of fininte length there is still a limit to what we can represent. Ultimately this turns out to be wasteful, and you're better off just using longer regular variables.
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:31:15
Lets say bitcoins are worth a bazillion dollars, would you pay $10 to move $50 between your wallets? I think not. So if the value of bitcoin goes up either fees must come down or small time users must stop using the system.
However the volume of transactions could save bitcoin. Let's say fees remain at 5 cents but bitcoin scales to 7 transaction per second (the current limit). There's one block every 10 minutes so that's $210 per block. Today you get ~$10k per block from the reward, but that's going to come down to 0. See how there's a shortfall?

A Hash is a small digest that is created from any piece of data. The point of the digest is to check the integrity of the data, it's constructed in such a way that if the data changes then the hash changes in an unpredicatble way.
Bitcoin does what is called reverse hashing. You keep on changing the data until the hash of the data is close to 0. It turns out that this is difficult to do - the only viable way is to pick some random data, hash it and see if the result was 0. Each calculation is a bit like a lottery ticket. It takes millions of calculations to win.


Miners keep on changing the data until they get a hash close to 0. When they do they tell everyone the data, and everyone agrees to reward them with 25 Bitcoins.
'the data' in this case is the next block on the block chain.

- Tainting isn't very effective. It's expensive to track and far too easy to tumble.
- To the extent that it is possible, tainting is impossible to prevent (after all it's just the same as coloured coins).

Banks don't give each other money digitally. They may appear to do so at the retail level but actually the systems in the back office tally up each day how much one banks owes another bank. At the end of the day they will settle up the net balance.

At a basic level a bank *could* put a bunch of dollars in a truck and drive to another bank without going via the US, so it is 100% possible.
Some countries with sophisticated banking systems have great reasons not to send their money via the US. Do you think that if an Iranian bank wants to pay a Russian bank they would go via the US? Clearly there's a massive incentive for them no to in this case. 
Given means and incentive it's reasonable to assume they don't. Now I personally don't know for certain what Russian and Iranian banks do, I don't believe your bank manager does either.

tion of coins and therefore the distribution of future votes. In fact, the exact voters of future
blocks must be deterministic, perhaps chosen by a PRF on the contents of past blocks, so by
choosing which blocks to vote on, a miner can skew the distribution of future votes in his
favour. As an extreme case, the miner could simply do a proof-of-work, where the “work” is
finding new blocks which give him every future vote.
This is fatal for centralization, and because each miner is individually incentivized to act this
way, it is also fatal for consensus

The private bank might go bust and you might lose your money, but if you put it in a central bank you won't lose it. They can therefore (sometimes) charge you for this service.
When you invest in a bank, the 'trust' is that the bank will make a profit. When you save with a bank, the 'trust' is that the bank will pay you back. They are different levels of trust (with different levels of legal backing behind them).
Anyhow it's your perogative not to trust banks. Whatever. Just becuase *you* don't trust them doesn't mean they are not safe places to store money. And by any empirical measure savings acounts are far better than bitcoins for saving money.

All this talk of pruning sounds very poetic, but what does it mean in practice? Either you bully ghash.io or you bully the miners themselves. It's not congruent with how bitcoin works, short term, and largely ineffective. 
Instead of looking at Ghash specifically, ask yourself: "why do miners like centralized pools?" "why is this a problem for bitcoin?". Solve either of these and you have a working system for fixing the problem.

The FBI definitely moved the coins, so I'd reasonably assume that the servers they confiscated had the private key on them. For any service where you can automatically withdraw bitcoins (e.g. bitstamp, btce) this has to be the case.
There's no doubt that he could have managed security better - for example storing 75% of his coins in cold storage.

I'm saying I'm unable to accurately predict the effect of having a larger pool to choose from. The brain is a strange beast, what works well for a small example doesn't necessarily translate to more complex situations. One thing you're overlooking is that the short wordlist is a form of error correction. If you can't quite remember your passphrase someone can help you based on the wordlist. If you make that wordlist longer then your memory has to be keener or you lose your funds!
But anyway this is all silly. You're completely ignoring my other point which is there is no upside to memorising a good brainwallet passphrase. You're left with a solution that is inferior to BIP38 with the added disadvantage that you might forget the passphrase.

Sure. Firstly the USD leg isn't on chain, so that doesn't come into it. It's for classical accountants to verify that the operator isn't stealing your USD.
Here's how a sell would work:
* I deposit BTC to an adress the exchange has generated for me: 1MYBTC.....
* I execute a sell order.
* The exchange generates a transaction that pays the exchanged btc to 1YOURBTC... and the exchange fees to 1EXCHANGE..., change goes back to 1MYBTC... 
There are some optimisations that would need sorting out, in particular:
* Trades should be batched up to save on fees. Most exchanges already do this for withdrawals. 
* Additionally you might want to group up little trades into larger ones anyway just to save spam.
* There might be an argument for transacting every 15 minutes not ever transaction. Or an arrangement where coins only move to allocated wallets 1 hour after the last trade, so that people continuously buying and selling small amounts don't pollute the block chain.
* No need to wait for confirms since all trades are your own. 
* In order to improve privacy you'd need to use HD wallets.

Public address = the long string that begins with a "1", people use this to pay you, you can tell it to everyone.
Private address = the long string that begins with a "5". Anyone who has this can steal your money. Keep it very secret.
passphrase = What you type into the brainwallet page to get to your private key (and hence bitcoins). It's also what you need to spend your BIP38 coins. [Confusing point: a brainwallet passphrase needs to be exceedingly complex to be safe, wheras a BIP38 passphrase does not, for BIP38 stick to something you can defintiely remember].
Encrypted Key = The long string you see when you print out your BIP38 wallet, usually it's in the form of a QR code, but it's also written down underneath. Begins with "6P". You want to keep this secret, but you don't want to lose it.

So mathematically 10 minute confirmation times are no more secure than 30 second confirmation times, and even that is not fast enough to be 'instant'. Of course I get it.
But if you've ever sat with someone who doesn't trust you and is a bit paranoid you'll know the massive frustration that comes with 10 minute waiting times.
There are a whole load of risks that would be mitigated by a single confirmation (even a weak one), and no real downside to decreasing confirmation time down to two minute blocks (possibly even less). It seems like the wrong call to me.

Why do much hate? This is a great question.
Reverse hashing functions have two key properties:
* Expensive to calculate
* Cheap to verify.
If you can find something 'useful' with those properties then great you can build a coin on top of it. Unfortunately most problems are simply expensive to calculate and expensive to verify. Primecoin tries to do this (find a prime number, win a coin) it's dubious whether prime numbers are all that useful but hey they are more useful than hashes.
It's worth noting that gold also fails the 'useful work' criteria. Digging gold out of the ground and turning it into bars and then burying it again in bank vaults achieves nothing and is a tremendous waste of resources yet few question the validity of doing such work.
One solution I thought of: Finding extra terrestrial life. Very hard to do, but should be very easy to verify. To this end I have started Xenocoin. Unfortunately not a single block has been mined yet :(

Imagine you're an investor with some money to invest. There's a whole world of things you could invest in. But there's a problem: If you want to buy gold you need a bank vault, if you want to buy oil you need a tanker, if you want to buy Japanese shares you need a broker in Japan... You can see how this quickly becomes a pain in the ass to manage!
Where do ETFs come in? Well exchanges are supermarkets for investors and the ETFs are the prepackaged items on the shelves. Rather than buy the gold / oil / etc yourself you simply buy a fund that owns the underlying product. No need to bother with bank vaults, tankers, etc, the fund does that. Even better they funds deal with most of the compliance and regulation.
Using an exchange is a bit like using a betting website. You have a list of funds and prices and you simply click to buy or sell. Very easy.
How does this help with bitcoin? Well there are many investors who would like to hold bitcoin but don't have the technology to store it safely, or maybe they don't want to get involved in the legal / regulatory situation. Once the wilkevoss ETF is live they won't have to worry about all this, they can buy the Bitcoin ETF the same way they buy everything else!
Why should you or I care? Well this should provide liquidity to the market and liquidity should provide price stability.
It's worth mentioning the downsides of ETFs: Firstly they tend to charge a ~1% management fee per year. Secondly you get credit risk - if the fund gets goxxed then you're SOL. Though funds tend to be extra heavily regulated and audited exactly to mitigate this risk.

**TL;DR** Using Sybil attacks to saturate the network you can infer the IP address that generates transactions.
I think this vulnerability is already known. Mike Hearn mentioned it in a presentation of his that I saw. You can mitigate it the following ways:
* Use TOR [Warning: has other risks!]
* Relay your transactions via a trusted good node (possibly hosted on a VPN)
* Mine your own transactions ;)
The following options would requre bitcoin extensions:
* Have some trust system for nodes.
* Have a cost attached to some nodes to prove you are different to other nodes.
* Proof-of-passport, uses funky crypto / maths and your passport to prove your node is different to other nodes.

Most Merchants would look at the transaction, see that it has no fee, and decline the payment.  Merchant software handles this automatically. This would leave you in an awkward situation: you have paid and the funds might get confirmed, but the merchant won't accept them!

Wat?  I don't know where you're getting this stuff from.  None of this is true.
Transfers generally have to be reported, but to the regulator. There's no cut (and 5% would be way too much).
Let me ask you this question: How did banks do transfers in the 1930s before databases existed? Or in the 1890s when many branches wouldn't even have had telegraph wires? Or even in the 1960s when US banks had databases but foreign banks did not?
Let me answer for you as well: Each individual bank would settle with every other bank. As long as the pair of banks had some agreement that they were both happy with the system works. No Fed, no central database, no hierarchy granting value.
It's all become electronic of course, but the principles remain exactly the same.

My favourite bugbear are all the people who think that bitcoin will somehow fix the ills of the economy and / or make the world a fairer place. To wit, adopting bitcoin more widely itself will not do any of the following:
* End fractional reserve banking.
* End debt based economy
* Solve the ills of the finance / banking sector.
* End the dominance of existing players in the finance / banking sector.
* Make banks obsolete (of any sort: retail, investment, central,..)
* Help distribute wealth more fairly.
* Remove corruption in politics / prevent vested interests from buying influence.
Indeed in some cases widespread adoption of bitcoin could even make things worse!
@_date: 2014-07-28 08:04:02
Your "end" is not well defined. In essence a fractional reserve bank is no different to an IOU. I can write an IOU to my friend and *boom* fractional reserve banking just started again.
You are also failing to grasp what impossible means. Today people earnestly believe the world is flat and the moon landings never happened, etc etc. Therefore it is **possible** to believe such things today.
[It's also worth noting that no informational inefficiency exists for banking. Most people are fully aware that fractional reserve takes place - certainly everyone managing significant assets knows this]

10 minute block confirmation times.
*EDIT*: OK people don't seem to get this. In *almost* every respect transaction time doesn't matter. And if you make it too small you start getting problems due to network propagation time. However there are some cases where it does matter:
* Any attack that reverses a confirmed transaction requires mining power. Most people don't have this.
* There are human factors. Psychologically seeing your order as confirmed is far more reassuring.
Therefore, all things being equal I'd say that confirmation times ought to be as low as they can be whilst avoiding any significant propagation time issues.

If anything non deflationairy currencies (bitcoin, gold) help make sure the wealthy stay wealthy.
Think about it: If you are cash wealthy then to stay rich you need to invest your cash, otherwise inflation will erode away its value. [fundamentally 'investment' means giving or lending wealth to other people, so this is great for everyone]. Similarly if you have a large debt (e.g. a mortgage) then inflation will over time reduce the burden of this debt.
(The main reason why poor people lose out to inflation is because their wages don't always rise in line with inflation. Which is more a political / employment issue).
Bitcoin and gold don't have deflation, so all things being equal the wealthy bitcoin / gold holders will get even more wealthy over time. Worse than the current system.

**Simple version:** 
These are just altcoins. Like most altcoins they have some unique technical aspects that make them interesting, but right now they are a gamble and of little interest to anyone except cryptonerds and speculators.
**More complex version:**
The thing all these coins have in common is some notion of property (or contracts). With bitcoin all bitcoins are the some (more or less). With coloredcoin (etc) you can say "this is my coin - whoever has it can return it to me in exchange for a free button", then give it to one of your friends, who in turn could give it to his friend and so on. By attaching more elaborate contracts to your coins you can design more interesting subsystems - though nobody yet has answered the question of how do you enforce these contracts. However you can build on this idea to come up with much more interesting use cases.
Bewarned that these coins are still mostly in the design / experimental stage and may not even work properly yet. They are interesting to study but be extremely skeptical if you are thinking of investing money in them.

@_date: 2014-05-12 09:48:51
Good question.
First off it still costs. About 1-2% for FX and transfer fees, and a whopping 1% goes to bitstamp.
Sellers still have to take some risks: Bad debt, price movements during trade, bitstamp credit risk, FX risks, and the risk that their bank account gets shut down.
Once you add all this up, charging a 1-2% premium on top is fairly modest.
The biggest hurdle to knocking this down is still the UK banking sector. As long as they are hostile to bitcoin businesses you'll have to pay a premium to get bitcoins.

So I assume these 'free' CPUs are free to mine bitcoin today (and presumably they do), but the income they generate is minuscule. 
It's going to depend on how much the total hashing power is then. The amount of free CPU is fixed (or at least doesn't meaningfully vary with bitcoin adoption). If you pick a more ASIC resistant algorithm then free CPU workload will significant for longer - but it will become insignificant eventually. (Assuming hashrate increases forever - which is fine for these physical limit perspectives).

Now you're the one who is weaselling out! In many respect the bitcoin license is far easier to get (it will no doubt be far far cheaper). Therefore it's completely misleading to call it a ban. Operating a taxi in New York is both highly restrictive and highly expensive, yet ask anyone in the US "are taxis banned in new york?" the answer will be pretty clear. 
Calling this a ban is FUD (as it is proposed right now - not some arbitrary straw-man). We don't help the debate by spreading FUD.

**TL;DR:** Alleged scammer opens up Skype account in similar name to OP. Convinces a guy to pay him directly. Guy then claims to Localbitcoins that he was scammed by the OP.
It strikes me that the localbitcoins guy didn't realise that it was a different Skpye account - they look very similar at first glance.
However it begs some questions:
* How did the customer and scammer discover each other? Seems like the scammer initiated the conversation with the customer. He'd need access to your account in order to do that.
* How did the scammer cancel the trade (and thus release the bitcoins back to the customer)? Again he'd need access to your account.
Seems like the scammer knows your password and login details. If you are a pro trader you should be using 2FA so it's hard to explain this!

Sure banks can (and will) play nicely with bitcoin. Here's why: Banks like money, bitcoin makes money. Yes it's that simple. 
Bitcoin exchanges are subject to relavent regulation. Banks generally aren't allowed to run public exchanges (when you buy foreign cash to go on holiday, actually the bank has to buy it from an exchange). So it's really a chalk-and-cheese thing, and so yes the regulation is different.
If you put realcoin in the picture, well banks still won't be allowed to run the exchange. Not much changes.
And your point about fees makes no sense, they are determined by the market. If you make it easier to transact fees will go down. This is one of the key wins for realcoin.

Not per unit time. One 10 minute confirmation (expected wait time = 10 minutes) is just as secure as twenty 30 second confirmations (expected wait time = 10 minutes).

There's no reason why a bank wouldn't offer accounts denominated in BTC. The advantage for Joe Average is that his money is very safe, and he doesn't have to worry about any of the technicalities of keeping keys secure. The bank may charge a small fee for keeping his bitcoins safe, but plenty of banks already charge for current accounts so Joe is used to this.
Even better, the bank might be able to offer saving accounts that give him a small return on his bitcoins stored there (just like they do today).

This can be split into two questions:
* is the version you downloaded the same as the version the author of bitaddress.org wrote?
* is the version the guy wrote to be trusted?
There is a whole chain of trust here. Your browser, Your computer, parts of the internet network
 bitaddress.org website, bitaddress.org author(s). If the website has the https icon and you trust your computer and your browser then you know the network is safe. You could check the checksum of what you download vs the version in github to verify that the link between the authors and the host website is safe. However there's no way to prove that the authors can be trusted without learning JavaScript and verifying the source code yourself. Your only hope is to trust the  community as a whole will verify this for you.
Consequently if you're truely paranoid but not prepared to study JavaScript and cryptology for 3 years I suggest the following:
* verify you computer and browser are safe (fresh Linux installation etc)
* check that when you download but address.org it does indeed have an https icon
* wait 1-2 weeks
* look on reddit / bitcoin talk for reports of bitaddress.org hacking, malicious checkins, anomalous thefts from bitaddress.org cold wallets etc
* if there are none then your version from 2 weeks ago is probably ok.
I'd say this is fairly paranoid, but only you can decide what the right level of due diligence is for your funds.

The first half of the write-up talks about how banks can settle without central banks, but with some counterparty risk. Much of the banking industry works like this. Note how banks hold deposits with each other, this is another form of IOU basically. Note how banks still have to settle with each other at the end of the day.

If I sell my house, I'm not going to take 'fake' or 'printed' money or IOUs. I want real dollars. When a bank gives you a mortgage they have to pay the seller actual greenback money. Where do they get this from? Well up to a point a bank will hold cash reserves, but if the reserves are depleted the bank absolutely has to go to capital markets to get money.
Banks balance their flows on capital markets each and every business day. What do you think they are doing?

It's possible. Chances are the first thing you'd do though is spend your coins in such a way that the transaction is only valid on one side of the fork. Thus doubling your money.
Even if this isn't possible, it would be possible to write a double spend app that keeps on sending the money to two of your own addresses until the money gets split on each fork.

People always glossed over just how hard this idea would be to implement. It would require significant complex non-backwards-compatable changes to the bitcoin protocol. Given that even small changes to fees or blocksize are hugely controvertial, sidechains are never going to happen.

The procedure is:
* Press buttons on the machine to indicate you wish to sell BTC and receive cash.
* You'll be given a recipt with a QR codes on it. 
* Send the requested bitcoins to this address. Wait for a confirmation.
* Go back to the machine, scan the other QR code on the recipt.
* The machine will vend you money.
Note that individual operators have some discretion over what the limits are, whether you need ID, how many confirms to wait for, what price to offer, etc. Also there is a chance that your local machine simply doesn't have the fiat in it. I suggest you contact the operators and find out how they manage the specific machines you plan to use.

I don't know what to say. It's like you're not hearing me.
It's not the size of your media collection that matters since you didn't pick randomly - it's how many people have the film / book that you chose from that matters. (Of course if you picked randomly it would be a different story).
It's a similar story with the manipulations. If you randomly substituted - great, if you devise something in your head - not so great.
And the point is it's a one-sided bet. Maybe you're safe, but if you lose you lose everything. It's a stupid game to play because there's nothing to win. Just randomly generate something and you're safe.

The bank is *charging* you to keep it in the bank. If you keep it in a mattress you will lose less. This has nothing to do with inflation which will act equally on both the mattress and the bank account.
Obviously with 10million you'll need to keep it somewhere more secure than a mattress, but the same logic applies. Just take it out of the bank and hold on to it. You'll save money.


Perhaps - but generally people with 10 million cash in the bank are not financially stupid - they will know that this is an option. Yet they choose to keep their money as cash in the bank. Why?

Banks don't hold currency / gold / oil / etc in their premises, that's true. [well some banks do, but it's rare]. However when a bank owns these assets they are held somewhere, and whoever is looking after them will charge the bank costs for keeping these assets secure. The FED will charge for these services, someone has to pay to run Fort Knox.
Even for the demagogue bank that believes in that has no assets whatsoever - maintaining customer accounts, websites, phone numbers, aml / anti fraud procedures, etc, all cost money. You'd reasonably expect to have to pay for these services.

Entropy is a measure of how much information is in the passwords. If you increase the size of the wordpool you really do increase the entropy. That's exactly how it's defined.
Does the increased word pool make it more complicated to remember? You're saying it doesn't. I say it does. It certainly can't make it any easier to remember for sure! Ultimately it's hard to resolve without testing (ask 100 people to remember random phrases for a week etc etc) and I doubt either of us are in a position to do that. 
My point about the reward remains though. Even if you do manage this feat of memory, what do you win over just using BIP38 with a simple passphrase and make a few copies to provent against loss? You don't win much in my humble opinion.

It's the concensus of the network. i.e. Everyone.
In terms of mechanics, the first transaction in each block is newly minted coins paid to the miner (or more usually the pool operator). If everyone agrees that the block is valid then by definition they also agree that this transaction of new coins to the miner is also valid.

Technically you're right, but ultimately you're left with a paradox:
Either your randomly generated passphrase is memorable, in which case it almost certainly doesn't have enough entropy and is at risk of being cracked. You'd be safer using a BIP38 wallet instead and keeping the encrypted text secret (or at least reasonably secret) so that even if a cracker gueses your passphrase your money is still safe.
Or it's not memorable and you have to write it down somewhere. You're then at risk of someone stealing the written passphrase. You'd be much safer using a BIP38 wallet with a simple passphrase instead. That way if the wallet is stolen the attacker can't get your coins.
**tl;dr** Even in cases where brainwallets are technically safe, you're better off using BIP38.
[If you have superhuman memory you might trust your mind to store a high entropy passphrase. Realistically most people struggle to accurately store enough entropy over long periods, and given the potential cost - why take the risk?]
@_date: 2014-06-27 09:33:59
There's a difference between "$0 risk" - meaning the value of the risk you take is zero, and "0 dollar risk" - meaning you have no risk to the value of bitcoins in dollars (well that's what it means here anyway).

You could do that. Or you could print two copies, keep one in your house and one in your folks house. Much cheaper and simpler.

Hmm there should be a FAQ on this.
Firstly the law of the land still applies (just like it does for cash transactions) so you have legal recourse. Next reputable companies still care about their reputation. However if you buy from less reputable companies in far flung lands then yes - you're at risk. Caveat emptor!!
But is this a bad thing? Credit card companies don't provide their grantees for free - they charge merchants 3-5%, which in turn means you pay higher prices. Worse they charge this fee even for transaction you'll never reverse (e.g. restaurant bills, supermarket purchases etc etc). Finally there are still categories of transaction which are too risky and the credit card companies will prevent outright.
You could imagine a wallet company (e.g. coinbase) setting up a seller verification scheme - like ebay have. If you buy from a verified merchant and pay coinbase 3% coinbase will protect you.

*Do not use a brainwallet.*
Brainwallets are insecure by design. They invite you to pick a passphrase. The problem is that humans are terrible at generating passphrases. Worse, brainwallets have no sane protections which mean attackers can guess passphrases at the rate of millions every second.
In contrast BIP38 is designed to be safe. To acess the funds you need both the encrypted key *and* the passphrase. The passphrase doesn't have to be mega-complicated because you need the encrypted key as well. Even better the process uses modern cryptography which means even sophisticated attackers are limited to a few dozen guesses per second.

The insurance covers the entire asset (capital+interest), not just the interest earned, so the cost is compared to the entire asset. After all it's the amount you have at the end that matters, not how much of it was interest.

The reason why people mine namecoin it is that it is merged-mined with bitcoin, so the costs of mining it are negligible. The rewards are pittance too, really namecoin would work better off the back of bitcoin with proof-of-burn than the whole NMC thing.
Fiatcoin is just an idea - miners would basically be institutional banks, no need to reward them for mining, they have adequate income already. Mining would be a public service they are mandated to provide.
Votecoin miners would be paid centrally by a neutral committee. Providing them with an incentive to mine fairly and a disincentive to do any mining shenanigans.

Address validation is easy to do - anyone can do it. If you don't like address validation then switch to a currency where it's not possible (Darkcoin perhaps?)
If the regulators want to mandate that all addresses are validated then they will do just that. In that world either every company performs their own checks, or 3rd parties will do it on their behalf (aka coinvalidation).

The bitcoin licences is a lot of things, but what it is not is:
- Coin-tainting / white-listing of addresses.
- Any sort of ban on using bitcoins, implicit or explicit.
- Any sort of ban on specific bitcoin business models (other than dishonest ones, scams, ponzis, etc which are illegal anyway)
- An alternative sort of coin
We should definitely rally and try and combat the regulations, but I don't think it helps the debate to spread FUD like this.

Bitcoin doesn't somehow magically make governments redundant. You still need governments for policing, defense, education, healthcare, roads, etc etc. Governments need to pay for this somehow, and inevitably some governments will screw up.
Case in point, Argentina has no control over the US dollar (and inversely there's no reason why the US would manipulate the dollar just to give Argentina a hard time), yet they still screwed up.

* Addresses have no identity attached to them, so it's very easy for a man-in-the-middle to alter them without anyone noticing.
* Address reuse compromises anonanymity
* Address reuse exposes you to certain categories of RNG bugs.
None of these risks (on their own) are major, but the cost of using a new address each transaction is virtually nil, so there's no justification for taking even minor risks here.


BIP70 isn't a centralised service?
Still you're right - ultimately you have to transfer bitcoins to an address for that is what a transaction is. However the whole idea that something is "your address" is dangerous, as is the idea that you should "send an address". This is what we need to move away from. Instead you should have a wallet (which contains an infinite number of addresses) and you should send payment info, which securely transfers information about an address in such a way that it proves the request originated from your wallet.

There is a simple rational explanation for this:
Trading activity is usually correlated with volatility not flow. Most trading volume is due to people trying to make money from trading - not from people who have fiat and need bitcoins (or vice versa).
MtGox prices are very volatile right now, due to MtGox's distress. This attracts traders trying to make money from day trading, which pushes volumes up.

True - it's great for everyone who has bitcoins (generally the wealthy). It sucks for everyone who has nothing or is in debt.
In the Keynsian system you don't get to stay wealthy just by saving. You have to lend at risk. Conversely if you have debt you can (in principle) just hold it and wait, eventually it will deflate into nothing.

I'm not sure where you're going with this. People use cash because they don't want the risks that come from using bank accounts (otherwise why not just trade online in escrow?). You could in principle escrow cash via a 3rd party, but nobody provides these services.
The weak point in any cash scam is that the scammer needs to remain relatively anonymous. This is simple to resolve by demanding reputation but alas the nature of bitcoin is that many people are discovering bitcoin for their first time, so it's normal to see buyers with no rep. Traders can start asking for ID and the like, but that will still put off some buyers.

Unfortunately we can't have it both ways. We can't say "regulation is bad" at the same time say "banks should be punished more when they do bad stuff".
You can say "bitcoin doesn't need regulation", "Ben Lawsky's plans are all bad" and even "moneylaundering is a made up crime" but you've got to accept that the downside is that it will be easier for regimes like Sudan to finance themselves if bitcoin is popular and unregulted.  
I get you're trying to say "Ben Lawsky's particular flavour of regulation is bad", perhaps so, but it's a *very* fine line to be walking.

Debate on the issue is of course healthy. However the unalterable facts are:
* Bitcoin itself cannot be regulated, thats the clever thing about it.
* Financial transactions are already subject to regulation. There's no realistic prospect of removing these.

Or maybe they will offer interest and underwrite some risks themselves (like banks do today). Time will tell.
One thing that is certain though: People like to earn income. Right now even fairly low grade investment schemes are popular (havelock, cex.io). I can imagine that if a mainstream bank were to offer small amounts of interest on BTC deposits it would be a *very* popular product.

To send any amount of bitcoin anywhere is a few cents. Western Union varies depending on how much and where but it's about 4-10% so on the face of it bitcoin wins hands down. The problem is that people often want to use bitcoin to transfer fiat value. This can be done (buy bitcoins -&gt; transfer bitcoins -&gt; sell bitcoins) but is more expensive.
Buying bitcoins in western countries is about 1-5%, selling them in less developed countries might be nearly impossible. Even if it's the same it's still a net cost of up to 10% - which is about the same.
Finally you have ease-of-use questions. Western Union has a branch in every town or village in the world, and doesn't require any special technology. Bitcoin has BTC price risk while you hold it which can be nasty.

I don't think so. Exchanges could batch up transactions to reduce blockchain bloat. They already do this for withdrawals.
Also not every transaction needs to appear on the blockchain. Exchanges could choose to move coins that haven't been traded for 24 hours to an allocated wallet for example, so that HFT trading doesn't need to go on the blockchain. Or only allocate balances to the nearest 5 BTC with a small float in a hot wallet. There are many viable systems!

But the day after a halving event, the proportion of miners that suddenly find themselves 'marginal' could be quite large - large enough to perform a 51% attack if they colluded even.

@_date: 2014-07-30 08:30:56
My take on this: Bitcoin can't grow until fiat exchange costs get to 1% or less. Currently the only people who will use bitcoin are people who are in very inefficient markets (e.g. drugs, Iran, etc..), and buy-and-hold investors. All the other users are better served by mainstream finance right now. Yes paypal, western union, wire costs, etc are expensive, but they are not generally *that* expensive, and a small saving is not enough to tempt people to bitcoin. To compete bitcoin markets globally need to be sub 1%.
The biggest hurdle to that is banking. The problem is that banks aren't comfortable with working with bitcoin businesses. Here regulation is a double-edged sword, banks aren't comfortable because the regulation isn't clear. More regulation sucks balls of course, however if regulation was to be made clearer then banks might (might!) embrace bitcoin businesses, fees can go down, disruptive business models can take root, and proper growth can resume.
@_date: 2014-01-17 11:10:39
Most of these are simply early adoption hurdles:
Wallet security can be improved via software, 3rd party services, and eventually traditional banking models that hold BTC for you.
Anonymity is being worked on actively by the community. Just look at all the talk of stealth addresses, shared send, coin join, etc. By the time you've applied these you're safe to all but the most deadicated attacks. It's likely that in the future anonymity will come with a small fee, this is probably something we'll have to live with.
Fees are mostly a product of FIAT regulation. Hopefully as regulatory barriers are removed competition will increase and fees will go down. This will improve speed too.
If you're waiting an hour for confirmation your waiting for too many confirms. And anyway banking transfers can often take hours or days depending on where you are and who you are transferring to.
Since you're on a roll you should also mention volatility. Bitcoin's price volatility really is a significant barrier to trade. No doubt it will go down as the liquidity in the market improves but it likely to be a significant hurdle for a while.

Their argument is that regulation is inevitable, so you might as well grab a seat at the table and try and gain influence. This seems a reasonable observation to me.

@_date: 2014-11-03 18:07:13
Ok I'll level with you. I'd much rather user TextSecure or a LibOTR product - but there's one small problem: They are *terrible* apps!
See the thing is that WhatsApp revolutionized instant messaging. Mostly because it "just works". You install the app, your friends are found automatically, pictures and videos work, you *never* need to resend messages, it *never* gives you any errors..
TextSecure still uses SMS as trasnport, and I long ago forgot my mandatory password that I didn't want anyway. Xabber / LibOTR is horrendously unreliable. I get that this is due to their plausible denyability stuff - which is neat but not as good as actually being a reliable messaging app. Until they can actually function as messaging apps their cryptography is of little value except to the most paranoid of users.
What does that leave? WhatsApp clearly doesn't care about users' privacy, neither does Kik, or Viber. Wickr claims to care but is pure security theater - the protocol and the app are not open. That leaves Threema and Telegram as the only apps that both work and care about encryption. They may not have the best encryption out there but a) they at least function well as messaging apps, and b) they are making the right sort of noises (open protocols, open source, responding to cryptanalysis bugs, bounties, etc).
Finally if the geeks are fighting amongst themselves it really doesn't help. If we want people to care about privacy then (sadly) we have to make it very easy for them to do so. Telegram achieves this.
**TL;DR** TextSecure doesn't get messaging right, so the encryption is almost irrelevant.  Telegram gets messaging right and does a pretty good job of privacy / encryption. I can recommend it to my friends.

I you lend money to a commercial bank, that bank might go bust. Central banks can't go bust (because they can just print more money if they have to). Hence if you lend them money it's very safe. So safe that they might even charge you a fee to look after your money. Understand?

Sure it won't stop bitcoin, but it could prevent bitcoin from achieving value. It is entirely plausible that another more intrinsically compliant coin achieves more value.

The "weeks of profit" metric is a poor way to judge a fine. Look at it this way, suppose you work with 20 other people and you are fined for misconduct. The fine is 6 months of your salary and your boss makes you pay it. However the headline would read "Firm fined 2 weeks profits".
It's the same with HSBC. It's a big firm that does lots of things. Only part of it was fined, as such I imagine the fine is could be very significant for the department involved.
Just to be clear: I'm not saying either way whether the fine was big or not - I don't have enough data to hand. All I'm saying is that the metric of "weeks profit for the entire firm" is a stupid way of gaging the fine.
(Yeah I know rational arguments about banking tend to get tough treatment here. It's ok, I'm thick-skinned)

Your write up would be more scientific if in each case you told us how many GBP you spent and how many usd you received.
Also £100 is too small to be worth transferring in the fiat world. Not saying this isn't a problem of course but banks are much better with £1000, and once you get to £10000 you can get a specialist fx broker to help you and It becomes a whole load cheaper.

You cannot be trustless between USD and BTC. Ultimately the party that holds the USD can always choose not to release it.
The closest you can get is to have a crypto-derivative that is pegged to the USD. Basically a crypto-contract that is redeemable for a dollar's worth of bitcoin. The contract has a built in margin deposit so if the cryptocurrency price falls by x% the margin can be used to cover the loss. This only goes so far of course since if the price falls further then the holder of the contract has no recourse and loses out.
It's technically possible to be trustless between cryptocurrencies (e.g. sidechains). I've not looked in to this.

So this is the  myth about fractional reserve. When Goldman Sachs 'prints money' it doesn't have "United States of America" printed across the top. A Goldman Sachs dollar will have "issued by Goldman Sachs" written on it - or rather written in the contract of the bond that it's attached to. Nobody is forced to accept these Golman Sachs dollars as real money, and those that do generally expect a discount for it - they will typically only pay 95 - 97 cents for a dollar of Goldman Sachs debt.
Fortunately the system works because enough people in the corporate world trust that Goldman Sachs are pretty good at paying back their debt. They buy it and either wait for Goldman Sachs to pay it back in full (making a small profit), or sell it on to someone else who also trusts Goldman Sachs to pay it back.
If Goldman Sachs chooses to issue debt denominated in bitcoin, very little of this story changes. It's still up to the market to decide whether they trust "Goldman Sachs bitcoin" or not.

Most people look at expected return. Why you choose to ignore this and come up with a fairly useless metric instead baffles me.
You're still hung up on this binary outcome (does / doesn't store 100% of value) even though that's clearly not what matters. An asset that stores 100% of value 364 days a year and 0% 1 day a year is clearly junk.
Then you have the whole notion of 'dollar value' to deal with. If your asset holds Perfect dollar value but the dollar falls vs the euro, what do you conclude? And why is the dollar cash your benchmark rather than the US treasury bonds return?

Holding bitcoins can be a nail-biting ride. Holding cash (in a suitable interest bearing savings account) is never going to make you rich, but you don't have the worry that you will wake up with only 75% of the value you went to bed with.
Now measuring this is non trivial, and there are indeed a few exceptional cases where cash / savings accounts have failed, but you can't deny that broadly this is a fair point.

Sounds easy but this step cannot be done. Not without a centralised time server anyway but that would be contrary to bitcoin's decentralised ethos!
Your suggestion that the previous block miner emits a signal after 9 minutes has two major problems:
 - What incentive do they have not to emit this signal early / late?
 - How can you prevent them from pre-mining the next block (they have 9 minutes to solve this problem after all).

The bitcoin network datastream is identifiable and unencrypted even, but it's generally impossible to know for certain if a particular transaction was initiated by you. 
To date nobody has ever seriously talked about making the bitcoin protocol illegal, and it's not a very high badwidth drain so there's no major incentive for ISPs to block it.
It would be fairly simple to make bitcoin connections encrypted too. I'm not sure what the latest thinking on this is, perhaps someone could enlighten me? ;)
(Torrents aren't illegal either - only specific torrents of pirated content would be illegal. Plenty of legitimate companies use torrents.)

We tried this back in the 80s. The finance industry could (more or less) promise you anything and it was up to you to perform due diligence. The result was a lot of people getting ripped off - usually people who were a bit naive, your grandparents, that sort of thing. In the west at least we've decided that society is much better off if you simply make it illegal to sell sophisticated investment products to non sophisticated investors, and provide insurance.
Arguably we're paying more and missing out on the best opportunities as a result. But in reality the premium is so tiny you don't even notice it, and society is much better off because corporations don't prey on the vulnerable any more [or as much, depending on how cynical you are].

Google has rules about this kind of thing, I suspect you might fall foul of them. However the flow could look like this:
* 1. Download player app for free.
* 2. Do the bitcoin trasnaction
* * 2a. Generate a address for each user for each video.
* * 2b. User pays address
* 3. Upon recipt of bitcoin you unlock the video.
Step 2 is looks bit clunky, but you can use HD wallets to safely generate such addresses and there's a URI scheme for bitcoin - so essentially all the user does is click on a link that opens their wallet.
For step3 you could have the app use the blockchain api to query the blockchain for a valid payment. Or if you want something more robust you could host a server that does the same thing.
It's a bit quick and dirty but would work quite seemlessly I think.

Actually fee calculations for this type of transaction aren't trivial to calculate. My scheme will cost you more, so if you routinely spend funds from multiple addresses it's worth writing code to make custom transactions. However only specialists (exchanges etc) really worry about this. 
In real terms for the occasional transaction this will only add a few cents to your fees, it's hardly worth worrying about.

True, but this is no reason to recommend brainwallets. If you're liable to lose things then make more copies. Email it to yourself, give a copy to your parents, store it with your important documents, store it on drop box!

@_date: 2014-12-02 15:11:06
Here's the real answer:
Bitcoin is bound to work best in areas where margins are fat. Regular banking actually has very thin margins. The cost of sending money between western countries, even via paypal, is less than 1%. The cost of sending money domestically is even less. With these margins there actually isn't that much room for bitcoin to compete. The margins for sending remittances to developing countries are fatter, so you see bitcoin starting to make inroads here. By contrast the margins on the black economy are even wider still, so it's much easier for bitcoin to make inroads in these markets.
So it's no surprise that bitcoin is working best in grey markets, but as the technology and infrastructure matures you'll naturally start to see it make inroads into other markets. Starting with the least efficient. The most efficient markets (e.g. domestic banking) will no doubt be the last things affected by bitcoin.

Bitcoin addresses are smarter than you think. The address actually is a mini script that tells the bitcoin protocol how the coins can be spent. The usual script is basically "Whoever has the private key can spend these coins", but there are other scripts too. Other scritps include useful things (multisig) and less useful things (anyone can spend these coins, or nobody can spend these coins).
[Incase you don't know: Multisig is where any 2 out of 3 people (or more generally m/n) can conspire to spend the coins.]
The problem is that when you write a more complicated script the resulting 'address' becomes longer and longer. This has two problems: Firstly expecting users to grok that addresses can be arbitrarily long (and designing UIs to cope with some crazy edge cases that result) is a significant usability problem. Worse: These long addresses make the transactions bigger, which means users have to pay more for the transaction. It seems unfair to make your customer pay just because you use an unusual method of storing coins.
So the clever devs came up with a system where you can encode (hash) the script you plan to use to spend the coins into a "P2SH" address. This looks like a normal address but starts with a '3'. When you wish to actually spend the coins you have to provide the full script (and pay any extra fees that result), but anyone who pays you sees a fairly normal bitcoin address.

Really there's no point in any company (in a safe part of the world, with secure banking and accounting arrangements in place) to holding bitcoins.

Good writeup. The main failure of the existing market is that consumers have no idea what the value of protection is, and so everyone gets scalped by the middlemen (VISA, Paypal, etc).
With bitcoin this could be simplified. Pay $75 direct to the merchant and take the risk, or pay $75+x% to a trusted escrow (VISA maybe?) and VISA will cover you if the merchant screws you over. It's your choice. If I'm buying a TV then sure I'll take the protection. If I'm buying pizza then I'll probably save myself a few percent.

The maths is a bit more complicated than that.
The expected value of the next block is 12.5 *  p * b where p is your share of the total hash rate and b is your expected win from the bet by chance.
The expected value of the next block if you try and throw the bet is: 12.5 * p' * b' where p' is your share of the total hash rate once you throw away blocks where the hash doesn't cause you to win and b' is the win from the bet if you cheat.
Then you need to solve these equations. It's only worth cheating if the 2nd one is bigger than the first. Even then your chance of throwing the bet will depend on p'.
Roughly speaking though it's unlikely anyone will bother cheating unless the bet is very large.

For bitcoin, paying to store your money safe is the norm. See:

Small transactions might naturally migrate to an alternative blockchain, perhaps secured by merged mining. Or maybe we'll trust crypto-audits and multisig more and so small transactions will be done via large intermediaries (like banks work today).

Dividends or no dividens, currently overstock.com is in the business of selling stuff online. If it wants to change to the business of speculating on bitcoin that would require a board (or sharehodler) consensus.
I can't imagine why anyone would agree to it either. Overstock is pretty good at selling stuff online but has no track record of currency investment. 
Just because a company can diversify doesn't mean they should. Ultimately shareholders who want bitcoin risk can simply sell overstock shares (or use overstock dividends) and buy bitcoins. No need to mix the two things up.

Don't get this confused with the 51% issue. The problem is that those betting services are at risk of such double spend attacks by design. Infact it's worth performing such attacks even if you have 1% of the mining pool.

It will be very dull. Nothing will happen for months, possibly years. Eventually one of the GHash.IO admins will work out how to pull off a double spend attack that nets them a few million. Someone will lose out (likely a large service provider like coinbase). A few days later the story will be published and the price will take a hit.
After that who knows. Maybe the price will recover and it will be business as usual, maybe people will abandon GHash.IO, maybe coinbase will go bust, maybe bitcoin will take a huge reputational hit that it never recovers from.
One thing is certain though: Posting threads on reddit is not the way to solve this problem. Either bitcoin will adapt to inherently fix it, or get used to it as a 'feature', or simply fail.

* Bitcoin cannot freeze your account, Paypal can. (So can MtGox of course, which is why you should hold your own coins)
* Paypal has fees for merchants, though limited private use in a single currency may be free.

Not really. I guess the best way to demo this is with numbers. Let's say you have 100k invested over 20 years:
100k  for 20 years = 265.3k
100k  for 20 years = 255.4k
Cost of insurance = 9.9k, net percentage of assets lost 0.039%
100k  for 20 years = 110.5k
100k  for 20 years = 106.2k
Cost of insurance = 4.3k, net percentage of assets lost 0.04%
As you can see when the insurance is a bigger relative to the rate, the insurance costs you less in absolute terms and about the same in percentage terms.

All this is true, but nothing you say will change with block confirmation time. The incidence rate (measured in transaction fees or hashpower backing transaction or whatever) will be the same for any confirmation time. The problems caused by netsplits will be the same for any confirmation time.
Yes there will be more blocks orphaned, but the security of any transaction will be just the same. The consequence of orphaning a 30 second block is less than orphaning a 10 minute block, so even though it happens more often it all balances out.

There was a bug in the MtGox software that meant that people could withdraw bitcoins and then claim the withdraw never came through (which meant they could withdraw it again).
MtGox claimed that this was a bug in bitcoin itself. Infact it's a risk / limitation that (some) people were well aware of. MtGox got a lot of bad press for blaming bitcoin itself for their own bug.
However it turns out many other sites were actually vulnerable to this or similar problems. Including Bitstamp and BTC-e, which have disabled withdrawls until they fix the problem, and the darknet site SilkRoad2 which had it's entire funds stolen.
The core developers are coming up with multiple solutions to make this problem less of a risk.
What we still don't know:
* When will the exchanges fix their bugs and enable BTC withdrawls?
* How much (if anything) was stolen from MtGox (and elsewhere)? Will they be able to recover?
* When will the bitcoin reference implementation (aka BitcoinQT) be fixed? What will the fix be?

No there is not.
Once again, "The Banking System" is not a thing. What you have are a bunch of individual banks that are each independently trying to make sure the assets they own are good. How they do that, and who they trust, is up to them.
Some assets (government bonds for example) might require central registration. If a bank can't / won't register it can't hold those. But it can still hold USD in the from of cash, or backed by gold, or collateralized with IOUs from other banks / companies that they do trust.
Don't confuse this with a specific system like SWIFT. Within SWIFT I'm sure all sorts of limitations apply, but banking is bigger than SWIFT / SEPA / BACS / etc.

Let me explain the problem the banks are facing: If the banks allow people to trade bitcoins via their bank accounts and someone uses this to facilitate money laundring then the banks will not only get a huge fine from the regulators but they will also get 100s of headlines along the lines of "Barclays accounts used to launder drug money via bitcoin".
So instead they do the rational thing and close any accounts they suspect are involved in bitcoin trading. Sure they lose a few customers and piss off some of the bitcoin community, but the alternative is far worse. If you were a manager at Barclays (and wanted to keep your job) you'd do the same too.

Good question.
The thing is with brainwallets you're up against every hacker in the world ever, so you need enough entropy to protect against that. Also Brainwallets can be cracked at the rate of ~millions per second even on cheap hardware. BIP38 is of the order of ~tens per second.
With a paper wallets, as long as you have the only copy it's impossible for anyone else to hack, so you don't need any entropy at all.
Since it's likely you're not a millionaire and only a few friends / contacts will have access to the encrypted wallet you need only protect yourself against their cracking power - which is likely to be very little. You should be fine with 3-4 electrum words.

You're saying that if fiat collapses then bitcoin will (probably) succeed. I accept this.
I am saying that bitcoin succeeding will not (of itself) cause fractional reserve to fail. 
I'd also go a step further and say bitcoin can succeed within fractional reserve banking.
All of these can be true, it's ok. They can all be true if fractional reserve fails in 10 years. They can all be true if fractional reserve lasts another 2500 years. Don't mix the success of bitcoin with the demise of fractional reserve banking. They are separate things.

It's a very tricky question to answer, but let's look at where we are first:


Actually I think that pool operators will put the highest paying transactions in first. If a few people pay 0.00011 in fees they will get ahead of all the 0.0001 people. So the fee floats already - it's just that most people find that 0.0001 is enough to get into the next block.


Well no. Miners don't win any fees from transactions not included in the block. So all things being equal a miner might as well increase the size to include every fee paying transaction!
So to your question:


The only thing we can say for certain is that if the block size is fixed and bitcoin usage goes up, the fees will rise. It's not even clear if this is undesirable - miners provide a valuable service and should be rewarded for it. Even if it's undesirable it's the very same miners you must convince to change the rules, and they won't quickly vote themselves out of pocket!
If we allow the blocksize to grow then there are many many questions: What is the true cost of larger blocks to miners? Can miners form a cartel and prevent small transactions from being included quickly for the greater good of the network (and to help line their own pockets)? If we don't pay enough to miners presumably some will go bust and eventually the difficulty will go down. Is this a problem? Can it be avoided? How would we even know what the correct fee was?

Realistically if bitcoin is worth anything in the future there will be lots of people providing recovery services like this. If bitcoin is worth nothing in the future then it won't matter.

However it's far worse than this. Humans tend to pick aesthetically pleasing patterns - stars, spirals, etc. Of which there are far far less.


Minutes to hours I'd say.


Actually decryption and unlocking are the same thing. The device has to be encrypted using a key based on the pattern you enter. Since there's very little entropy in the pattern the resulting system will be easy to brute force.

Right - but a bitcoin service could 'just as easily' make this mistake. (Use of quotes because it's a pretty fundamental and stupid mistake to make, I don't see how a bank could screw it up in the first place). Bitstamp, or coinkite, or cex.io or anyone could be just as stupid here.

Wrong. Western Union has the most to gain from the bitcoin revoltion. Do you think they have vaults in many currencies and a private transaction network and FX matching system behind the scenes? Of course not. They pay for banking just like everyone else.
If they can do anything to reduce their banking fees they will surely gain more far more than the $20 you or I might save here and there. If they have any sense they will jump onto Bitcoin just as soon as it is safe to do so.

Your questions in non-sequitur. Nobody is forced to buy bitcoins, so if the fees are prohibitive then presumably they won't buy bitcoins.

English is terrible for error correction ("complament" vs "compliment"?), it would be more like 10 words.

You can't prevent fractional reserve banking. I can write "IOU  1 bitcoin" on a piece of paper and sell it to my friend and *poof* I've just created a fractional reserve bank. It's that simple!
Why does fractional reserve banking need preventing anyway?
[Don't confuse fractional reserve with audit! Real world banks are well audited, you know exactly how much (or how little) capital they hold, and they still work - generally. Exchanges can be audited, but only the bitcoin side so it's of dubious value (if an exchange holds all its bitcoins but is in massive fiat debt it will still fail). Fractional reserve and Audit are different things.]
@_date: 2014-07-27 14:35:36
How do you define the "end" of fractional reserve banking? Sounds like a scam to me.
You need to look up what "impossible" means. It's kinda like saying "it's impossible to believe that the world is flat", actually you can believe it. If you use the wrong words people will think you are stupid.

I know you hate taxation so much you want it to be rape. I don't like taxation either, but that doesn't make it rape. Yes I know rape has a "sieze by force" definition, but that only applies to wanton and / or unnecesary force. You can't use it for a semi-willing transaction. Lets try this:
"I caught the bus today and the driver raped me for £1.50 for a ticket"
You could torturously argue he took it by force, in the sense that if I didn't pay him he'd call the police who would have fined me or sent me to prison. But no reasonable person would say this was rape even if you do think it fits the definition you posted.

It wouldn't be any safer, but it would be less volatile which does have some advantages. I believe Satoshi thought that the difficulty would be fairly stable anyway so adjusting every block or every 2 weeks would make no material difference.
In hindsight he was probably wrong. A smoother adjustment function would be better (perhaps not every block, but maybe every 6 hours or so). Though it wouldn't make all that much difference other than removing one headache from miners' lives.

I'm torn on this. It could work really well in the case where Alice and Bob both have good intentions - essentially becoming a "request transaction reveral" button that's built into wallet apps.
The problem is that I doubt this would rarely fall to the trivial case. Most cases will require at least dialog between the parties, and possibly more. If you start with this assumption then you want a simple protocol where either Alice or Bob can submit a URL where further dialog about a transaction should take place.
@_date: 2014-07-28 08:34:00
The biggest danger with TOR+bitcoin is how do you know you're connected to the real network and not just a malicious simulation? You can verify that the network has the same blockchain that you saw previously easily enough - so I assume nobody is trying to run a false blockchain over TOR or we would have heard by now.
Just about the only other thing you can do is not relay transactions. This is good for zero confirm attacks where you simulate that the transaction is relayed but don't actually relay it, and might also help for double spends if you have some hashing power as well. 
However attacks like this are hard to execute, for starters finding someone who will accept zero confirms (or even 1 / 2 confirms) and also prefers to use TOR is rare, so such an attack would be expensive.
I don't think there's anything else malicious you can do. It's much more likely that this is a research exercise.

Address reuse isn't /that/ bad, but it does make your actions more traceable. With HD wallets there's no cost to generating a new address each time so you might as well do just that.
The seed  [or rather wallet app] doesn't 'know' which one you're using. It simply generates each address in turn and looks at the blockchain to see if there is any balance on them. Once it finds a few addresses without any balance or transactions in them it stops.
Side note: Don't assume that never reusing addresses grants you perfect privacy. It certainly helps, but it's still possible to perform some tracking.

[DNA is ~1.5Gb of data]( whereas a private key is 32 bytes of data, so there's far (far far) more data in DNA than in a private key. Hence DNA can hold many more possibilities than a private key could.
However the amount of actual variance found between humans is tiny. Humans share 99.9% of their DNA with each other. Still 0.01% * 1.5Gb = 1.5 Mb, still far far bigger than the 32 bytes in a private key.
Conclusion: Genetic variance is many orders of magnitude vaster than bitcoin private key space.

I'm guessing you don't know how banking works? If a *central* bank wanted to make a "profit" it could just print it. However since it doesn't have any shareholders, owners, or dividends though there's nowhere for the profit to go.

they could operate with BTC just fine.

If the bank had the facilities to store cash safely it would simply warehouse the cash and make money. Actually storing cash is expensive and the cheapest way to do this is to get the central bank to hold it for you at whatever rate they deem is fair.

* 4. Offer to allow tax payers to repay you in bitcoin up to a certain amount.

Although many here would be aghast at the idea of a back backed alt coin it could have a lot of potential. However the main hurdle is the fact that banks require full identity of their customers and reversible transactions, which isn't compatible with a blockchain based system.

You're forgetting why paypal came into existance in the first place. The public had a real lack of confidence in sites like ebay because how can you possibly trust some random guy on the internet to deliver you a Widget? Even if you pay by credit card, dispute procedures take months.
PayPal came up with simple payments and generous consumer protections. eBay and ecommerce boomed as a result.
And anyway, it's not too tricky to come up with cryptographic proofs to gurantee that the originator received his bitcoins. The fact that PayPal refuse to honour them is the problem. Not the refunds.

Wow this thread draws all the zealots out of the woodwork!!
Yes - you absolutely should be worried about the volatility. Bitcoin is not an investment you should hold unless you like taking extreme risks!!
[Side note - all the talk of the macroeconomics of inflation-proof currencies is little more than intellectual masturbation when the volatility is so high].
Bitcoin still shines as a means of transaction, and you should leverage that if you can (seems like you already are if you've used changetip). Maybe the price will stabilize in the future, but don't feel obliged to hold bitcoins yet if you don't like the risk.
@_date: 2014-01-14 10:34:40
Well my point is really that you have to store the password somewhere since you can't remember it. That place needs to be secure enough that it can't be lost or stolen. Presumably you have found a system that works for you.
The thing is those are exactly the requirements for a paper wallet. Instead of your complex password, simply store a BIP38 encrypted wallet with a *simple* passphrase (your 1st pet name, or whatever) then you'll be safer.

Since you're talking about a low number of high value transactions the standard advice of using bitpay / coinbase is less relevant here. Realistically how many customers are you likely to get paying bitcoin? Half a dozen or so?
First of all open an account with MtGox and Bitstamp and get yourself verified, put some small transaction through them and check that you can receive fiat currency all the way into your bank account. **Setup 2 factor authentication!**
I suggest you take each cusomer on a case by case basis. Agree how you're going to set the rate, how you'll transfer the bitcoins, how you're going to calculate things if there are any refunds / extra payments required, and what to do in a dispute. When you get the bitcoins into your exchange account convert them to fiat. Suggest you only put the fiat into your bank account once the job is complete.
I don't know how tight your margins are, but you'll have to accept the fact that since bitcoin is volatile you may well gain or lose a couple of % during this process. Also have a word with your suppliers / staff, Perhaps some of them want to take payment in bitcoin? If so try and arrange it so that you're holding the bitcoin for as short a time possible.
If you want to know more then pm me. I have a semi-professional interest in this sort of business :)

Basically if you use Authy it backs up your 2FA tokens to the cloud (why? who knows this is madness). If your email itself doesn't have 2FA then someone can get your email -&gt; get your 2FA tokens -&gt; get your bitcoins.
Another similar vector (if you use google voice) is: Get your email -&gt; get access to your google voice -&gt; get your bitcoins
The root cause is that your email itself is accessible, and putting 2FA on your email solves a lot of problems.  However saving 2FA tokens (i.e. what Authy does) and using google voice are also aggravating factors.

Interesting question. Obviously in some sense it would since if an attacker had your encrypted wallets and cracked one wallet she would instantly have access to all the others. However having multiple wallets with the same password does not make cracking any easier. Furthermore if an attacker has one encrypted key and the password she cannot access the other wallets unless she has the encrypted keys for those wallets.

I realise this is probably downvote material - but if you want an honest answer here it is:
* Financial privacy is important, but bitcoin is pretty private out of the box, and it's not obvious to me that improving this is more important than other things (educating non-bitcoin users, working with regulators, etc).
* The darkwallet team doesn't appear to work very closely with the wider bitcoin community. Why is there no BIP written for stealth addresses for example?
* They have some good ideas, but how can we know they are safe and secure? I'd like to see independent peer review.
* Fortunately they hove dropped lots of their [political ideology]( from the front page, but vestiges remain. I have no problem with people having ideology, but if I'm paying for something I want to everyone to be transparent about whether I'm paying them to develop software or to further a political cause.
* They could improve the user experience. For example no windows binary drop makes it tricky to "take it for a spin".

Yup. In exactly the same way that your bank can create USD for your mortgage backed only by government bonds and IOUs from other banks. They would need to be very careful though since if the USD price of gold falls they would be in trouble.


*Banking is only ever pairs of banks in agreement*. "You owe me $100", "will you accept this lump of gold", "oh ok then". That's it. No reporting to NY. No network of agreement. Nobody else granting anything value. No hierarchy. Just a pair of banks in agreement.

Here is the difference: 
*coin tainting*: If you send coins from an unvalidated address to a validated address the address becomes invalidated (i.e. you partition the network). [Strictly it's unspent outputs not addresses].
*address validation*: you can still receive coins from unvalidated addresses, and spend them in places that require validation.
The anti-taint camp has two major hurdles to overcome: Firstly: taint tracking suffers from numerous problems (tumbling, the fact that that anyone can dirty someone else's coins, etc etc). Secondly: to the extent that taint tracking is possible, it's impossible to prevent - in fact it's exactly the same as ColouredCoins.
So now you're left with a hard truth: Anyone accepting bitcoin payments and taking customer info is a potential taint tracker (coinbase, overstock, my local pizza delivery).  Why beat up coinvalidation in particular?

The problem is that address validation is easy to do in bitcoin. Anyone can do it. There's no point in shooting down every company that tries, you're just fighting the symptoms. If you don't like it you need to pick a different cryptocurrency.
There's a few things I disagree with:
* Does address validation lead to taint tracking? I don't see it, there are many other issues with taint tracking.
* Would taint tracking be prevented if address validation was (somehow!) preventable? Nope, literally anyone can track taint - just look at the MtGox forenzic threads to see that.
* Would taint tracking or address validation kill bitcoin? Nope, you could easily have a separate market for the different coins (this is *exactly* what the coloured coin project is doing)

Printers and Pens both have the same medium (paper) with the same problems with fire, water, etc. Pens are painfully slow and have a terrible error rate. You should be using BIP38 encryption so even if someone was snooping your printer they still can't get the bitcoins without your pass phrase. The risk of not writing down your keys correctly far outweighs the risk of hacking.

When you generate an encrypted paper wallet you get two QR codes.

You kinda got it upside down:
If Greece could print more money they would be able to pay their workers, and (in some sense of the word) their debts. Obviously Greece wouldn't get any wealthier due to the extra pieces of paper, so the net result is that the currency would devalue. This would be bad for bondholders, but not as bad as default. This would be bad for workers, but not as bad as being fired.
There are times when a little bit of devaluation / inflation can save you a lot of pain. This is the classic example.

Banks have pretty strict rules about where they put their profits (not to mention shareholders who generally want cash). Actually I'd be amazed if banks keep profits in anything other than cash or treasury bonds. The compliance and shareholder implications of anything else would be ridiculous.

I'm not going to defend the rules, but if you think enforcement is as simple as stopping people at borders and checking their suitcases for notes you are mistaken. 
Even if you hide the transfer, enforcement is very experienced in tracking downstream payments (wages, purchaes etc) too. Sure Bitcoin helps hide things, but actually the idea of making untraceable payments is not new and everyone knows this.

You're over thinking it. The case I saw they really were buying it from one person and selling it back to the same person immediately (with forward settlement) in order to skirt the letter of sharia law. Everyone (sharia or not) knows that if you pay back tomorrow it costs slightly more due to interest, but nobody ever calls this interest, and technically nothing is loaned, instead it's called forward settlement.
It also helps to understand the nature of settlement. People have been trading securities (stocks, bonds, etc) long before computers were around. Back then it was nearly impossible to get your money the same day as you did a trade since it required someone fetching cash from another building possibly in another town. The norm was to receive money a day it two later. Even though technology has moved on in most markets it is still normal to get your payment a day or two after trading. You might argue this is implicitly loaning cash, but people just consider it the mechanics of payment.

What happens is a malicious exit node is able to perform a Man-in-the-middle attack that strips SSL from the website. A truly diligent user would notice something is amiss because they have been redirected to the "http" url not the "https" url (and of course there's no padlock in the URL display etc etc), but it's very easy for an average user to miss this!
So TOR is not broken as such - it's well known that TOR (or indeed pretty much anyone) can inspect your unencrypted http traffic - but extreme care needs to be taken for sure.

There are also a fair few naive realists (regulations are unenforceable =&gt; what's the point) though they often underestimate just how easy it is to compel a corporation to conform to regulations.
Most of this is due to the nature of Reddit and the internet I think. In between the angry mob there are some people who can actually rationally say "this part is good, but this part is bad".

You can't prevent adhoc efforts and you can't prevent systematic efforts either, for exactly the same reasons.
Despite what some bitcoiners believe, we also can't prevent regulation. Given that regulation is inevitable (and indeed already in place), providing services that help companies comply is a good thing, as long as those services compete in a fair market.
To think that preventing regulatory services will prevent regulation is backwards. All we're doing is making life harder for members of the community who need to comply with regulation. (Maybe that's your aim? I don't personally think this helps Bitcoin's cause).

In theory even if a transaction is valid and as a fee there's no rule that says it will ever be confirmed. It's entirely up to miners. In practice standard transaction all get confirmed within a few blocks if there's a fee.
If you don't include a fee it may well never be confirmed. In practice I find that transactiosn *usually* get confimed within 48 hours, but occasionally they do not. If you really have no plans to use the funds within the next 5 days then sure skip on the transaction fee. Worst case is that the funds will remain where they started.

Oh yeah US healthcare is corrupt all the way down. The problem is the consumers don't care about the cost at point-of-sale because insurance pays. Hospitals know this so inflate the costs massively. Net result everyone loses expect insurance and hospitals.
In the rest of the world basic healthcare is provided by governments who have budgets and so need to keep the costs down. Hospitals are welcome to provide a premium service but consumers will only pay if they think it's worth it. Net result is much more transparent pricing.

One small problem with your analysis - I suspect far less goldbugs are redittors than bitcoiners. Plus the entry costs are higher - it's tricky to buy less than $500 of gold, so more people in are probably talk about it without owning any.
Still you're probably right for small amounts. I agree storage costs are negligible if the value of the assets is under $100k or so. The problem is that there aren't going to be many people holding larger amounts of unsecured gold, and many of those wouldn't want to admit to it being stolen anyway, so it's hard to build up an accurate picture.

Oh and while I remember - telegram has a time-to-live on messages. You can wax lyrical all you like about how snazzy your encryption is, but if your phone has stored a copy of the message (or the other person's phone has) then you're open to old-fashioned rubber-hose cryptanalysis, or the modern version where you're subpoenaed to reveal your passwords. 
If your app automatically deletes your messages after a day / week then the results of this are much reduced. Sure you might be diligent enough to do this manually but it's hard to make the person you're chatting with do this. Telegram does it for you, and while at a cryptographic level this is worthless, on a practical level this will possibly save you from problems much more than a better cipher algorithm ever will!

Some coins (e.g. ripple) don't have a ledger of all transaction. They rely only on concensus. This makes the forenzic analasys harder. However I don't know if it's possible to run a node on those networks and record every transaction into a database - presumably so.

Got a source for this?
Running a bitcoin node in TOR is not sufficient to prove that the transaction originated in TOR. Anyone could taint any transaction by being a node that listens on the clearnet and rebroadcasts over TOR. More generally it's impossible to track transaction origin and so it's impossible to taint this way.

Depends if you're talking about The Blockchain (i.e. the bitcoin blockchain) or blockchains in general.
The Blockchain is symbiotic with bitcoin, you're right.
Blockchains in general have other uses. Namecoin being the prime example. Blockchains can have different properties from the bitcoin blockchain. There's no requirement for them to be decentralized for example. You don't have to use proof-of-work. They can be more actively pruned.
Here are some example blockchain derivatives:
* Namecoin - merged mined with bitcoin, stores authoritative name lookups in a decentralized manner.
* Fiatcoin - mined by a finite pool of pre-approved miners. Allows anyone to make payments cheaply using an existing fiat currency.
* Bitmessage - Heavily pruned distributed mining. Not much incentive to mine, but not much cost to 51% attacks either. Used for secure anonymous communication.
* Votecoin - Short term distributed mining by semi-approved miners (e.g. anyone with a passport can vote / mine). Centralised payout mechanism to incentivise people to mine just for a week or so. Used to count and verify votes cast in a distributed manner.
* etc.
Much more research is needed on these alternative blockchain technologies, but they have tremendous potential.

I know I'll be downvoted for this, but I actually like my banks to be regulated. It's nice to know that anyone securing basic cash deposits has a close eye kept on them. That if my credit card gets stolen I'm not very liable. That if the bank goes bust the government will secure my funds. etc.

I guess there's a few things I'm looking for, in order of preference:
* In an emergency I need to be able to import the private keys into another wallet. The Mycelium encryption format is non standard. This is the  reason why I don't use Mycelium as my main wallet. There is a standard for this: BIP38. Though the Schildbach wallet simply AES256 encrypts a text file which is less elegant but works too.
* I don't want to share my public addresses! Either don't include them in the backup or encrypt them too! This is my  reason for not using Mycelium.
* I like the fact that you generate the key for me, but I'd rather it was from a word list rather than random characters. See Electrum or BIP39. Truly paranoid users might like the option to salt their keys with a manually entered component, or perhaps some information you can retrieve from the users profile or device.
* I like the fact that the backup comes with clear instructions and QR codes. This is the perhaps the best argument for using pdf, though I'm not sure it's strong enough to justify a relatively non-standard format.
* HD Wallets (BIP32) would alleviate the need for multiple backups and so would be a huge bonus. You could also then give people the option to delete keys from the app rather than just archive them.
* When I select the private key from the PDF to cut and paste it also selects half the line of the address. Here is a (redacted) picture:  Perhaps this is a bug in foxit reader, but in my mind it is an argument to not use PDFs.

My point is that the US doesn't historically step in to protect industries that are threatened by technical innovation. Why should money transmition be any different?
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:40:00


Bingo - yes!


Yes they are two completely separate systems. But they both have something they call a "passphrase" although they use them differently. BIP38 you need passphrase + encrypted key (so the passphrase doesn't need to be fort-knox secure). Brainwallet uses just the passphrase (so it needs to be mega secure).
The best thing to do is practice using just a few $ of bitcoins until you're comfortable depositing and redeeming coins until you understand how it all works.

The cheap solution is:
* User fills in form asking for ID.
* User gets presented with a unique personal bitcoin address for dontaions
Acutally you can use bitpay (or similar) to do this for you. I believe they offer free accounts to small charities.

You can't rely on these things:






Neither of us know what the future holds. To say 'you'll be safer in the future' is no good for people who expect privacy today. Let's not rely on crutches.






[You didn't mention frequency]


You agree on the individual points, broadly at least, yet you don't think together they make a large surface?? I'm not sure what to say :(
Thinking about it, it's nearly impossible to hide the fact that you paid multibit. Let's say you manage to make sure each BRIT payment is to a unique address, at some point you'll sweep all these addresses into a single address. All I need to do is make 1 payment, see where it gets swept to, and backtrack from there to find all the multibit users [or at least a subset]. There's not much you can do to stop this. You may be better off having a single payment address than maintaining the charade that you're hiding these payments effectively. It's more honest.
Anyhow I don't want to be entirely negative. I think you can fix things, or at least mitigate risks. Here's what I suggest:
* Most important: Put clearly in your FAQ that BRIT payments reveal that your addresses use multibit software, and in some cases can reveal how many wallets you own or even link your wallet address together. Yes, there are caveats, by all means explain this, but the base worst case risk must be highlighted. You owe it to yoru users!
* Fix BRIT so that each payment goes to a unique address (or use a single donation address). This removes any possibility of tying addresses together which is by far the worst risk! Yes there are concerns but privacy trumps this.
* Offer a freemium system so that users can pay you once and opt out of BRIT payments forever, or allow them to make bespoke manual BRIT payments that aren't attached to other transactions. Heck use improved privacy as a selling point - why not!
If you do this you'll be left open to frequency analysis. I'm not sure what can be done to prevent this. Perhaps a better mind than mine can come up with something?
[Here's how I'd fix BRIT: each time a user requests an address use CKDPub( masterPublicKey,  walletId % n ) or CKDPub( masterPublicKey, request number ) to generate a personalPaymentKey for that user. Each user does CKDPub( personalPaymentKey, BRIT payment number ) to make sure each payment goes to a unique address. Each seperate redeemer (or server) has a separate masterPublicKey so you can scale easily. You can write a job that runs every week / every night that walks the address space and sweeps everything up, I'll bet you can check a million addresses a minute (probably in a second), so this job will take &lt; 1 hour to run even with optimistic growth. Alas this makes it obvious the payments were related to multibit - can you do better? I'm not sure.]

Well part of the problem is that biotcoin is difficult to alter - you essentially need 51% of the network to agree on a fix before it is live.
In this case you'd need to change the protocol, run both versions in parallel for a bit, update every single bitcoin client, and then you could disable the old version. Quite a tall order!

Agreed, but if it's just a small spending wallet then it doesn't need fort-knox levels of security. Up to you of course.
Also as long as all the wallets use BIP32 they could share the same address tree. Sadly not all wallets support that yet.
Frankly if you want an easy to use cross platform spending wallet then go for an online option (blockchain.info maybe), you won't do much better right now I don't think.

You are. But your transaction is public.


No. But imagine you buy a pizza then use bitcoin to pay a drugdealer. The police capture the drugdealer so they see his address. They then look at payments to that address and they will see that the same address was also used to pay for pizza. They then subpoena the pizza firm demanding their records and find your address.
This assumes you used the same wallet for both, intermediary addresses would help a lot, but you can imagine how things start to unravel as you make more payments.

This is patently false. Here is how you create fractional reserve bitcoin:
* Write "I promise to pay the bearer 1 bitcoin" on a piece of paper and sign it.
* Give the piece of paper to someone else.
Boom! You've just created a fractional reserve bitcoin. It really is that simple!
The *only* tricky part is creating a market where your paper has any real value. You or I won't be able to do this, but a large bank easily could.
You do describe well the risks of creating fractionally reserved bitcoins. However there are strategies to mitigate these risks (e.g. buy mining hardware).

Well bitcoin is available to everyone and the fees are constant.
You might argue that there are variable fees to buy and sell bitcoin for fiat. Bitcoiners argue that this is a temporary abberation, and anyway in the future bitcoin will be sufficiently stable / liquid that you wouldn't even need to trade out for fiat.

There is a simple rational explanation for this:
Trading activity is usually correlated with volatility not flow. Most trading volume is due to people trying to make money from trading - not from people who have fiat and need bitcoins (or vice versa).
MtGox prices are very volatile right now, due to MtGox's distress. This attracts traders trying to make money from day trading, which pushes volumes up.

When you login your browser decrypts your private keys locally. At that point an attacker could spend your coins anyway, so there's not much point in asking for 2FA again.
You can have another level of authentication though. Account Settings -&gt; Password -&gt; second password. In this case your first password protects your public keys and your second password protects your private keys. Note that there's still no point in asking for 2FA again since the browser already has all the data that is protected by 2FA

I'm not sure how your definition differs from mine, except that you don't care about fees, but anyway...
Multibit payments won't work if you want to pay a tiny amount to read a newspaper article. That's because they need another transaction to attach to, and you [generally] don't make bitcoin transactions every time you read a newspaper article.

I think people don't understand what 2FA does. 2FA will never protect against Man-in-the-middle / man-in-the-browser. For that matter it's possible to bypass 2FA by compromising the 2nd party (blockchain via hacking or social engineering) or the 3rd party (google) though this is trickier obviously.
It does provide a layer of protection against password theft, compromised IO devices (keyloggers), and brute-force hacking via the front door [though conditions apply to all these]. Since it costs very little it's definitely worth having - but nobody should be under the illusion that it's the last word in security.
Crucially this applies equally to all 2FA schemes - greenwallet is no better than blockchain.info.

It sounds like you don't quite understand bitcoins yet. I suggest you do one of the following:
* Research bitcoins more.
* Trust your son with $100 (or whatever you feel comfortable with) and let him do his worst. The most you can lose is $100 and you might both learn something. Just make sure you supervise that he sticks to his permitted spending level.
* Nothing - arguably bitcoins aren't ready for prime-time yet. You don't have to buy them now.

I'm taking specifically about buying for 100 selling (immediately) for 101 but it's OK to pay me tomorrow.
Technically nothing is loaned, no interest is paid. But implicitly because I agree to allow you to settle tomorrow it is economically identical to an interest payment.
I'm no expert in the field. Just pointing out that that it can be gamed as much as regular finance, possibly more so.

Oh dear - you raise a valid discussion point op, but sadly the hivemind will likely downvote you rather than engage in discussion on the topic.
You have the problem of how much inflation is the right amount. You can't really measure transactions meaningfully due to the way bitcoin works (if I have 1000 mBTC and I sent 1 mBTC to address A and 999 mBTC to address B which is the spend and which is the change? you can't tell). You could have some sort of auction on the inflation rate, but how would you ensure the bidders were incentivised to set it fairly? You could have a cabal of inflation rate setters (kinda like how the Bank of England does it) but that looks rather like centralisation.
Ultimately there are plenty of altcoins out there that do inflate, so eventually the market will decide.

It's not as crazy as it looks! 
Back when all accounting was done by hand, using numbers with lots of factors makes the maths easy. Hence lots of multiples of 12.
For example. Let's say you have 1 BTC and you need to pay 6 people equally, how much do they all get? Much harder to do in your head than if you had 24 pennies.

You can argue weather DNS itself is decentralised or not. But the individual hosts are most definitely not of course. The client only uses this list if it can't find other hosts (I think), after that it caches nodes it has discovered previously. 


This is a good question. You actually run this risk if you connect over a private third party network (maybe the wifi of the cafe you are in) or TOR. How do you know you're connected to the real bitcoin network and not a simulation?
You can use various checkpoints to ensure the network isn't changing historical transactions, but you are at risk of the network lying about new transactions - i.e. it exposes you to double spend attacks.

It's not the whole story though is it?
The average time between blocks is 10 minutes, so you should be able to model it as 0.042 BTC per second rather than 25 BTC per 10 minutes. If fees exceed this then great, take the fees every time. Even if they don't block propagation doesn't take /that/ long. You'd need to calculate the BTC lost in the block propagation window (possibly far less). Finally there are protocol tricks - do you even need to propagate the whole block or is it sufficient to just propagate the header (fixed size)?

You can argue either way about whether this is good for bitcoin, but it strikes me as being rather bad for the whale.
If he's really trying to sell a huge quantity of Bitcoin he'd do far better splitting it into 100 or even 1000 lot clips that float with the market level.
If his aim is to push the price downwards then it seems a very expensive game given how much bitcoin he already has. I doubt he'll be able to pick up 1000s of bitcoin easily at a lower price. It's a huge risk to be taking.

No contradiction here. You're storing the bitcoins, which is great for you but does nothing for the wider economy.
Compare this to an inflationary currency - the aim is to arrange things so that the best 'store of value' for you, is also one that enables someone else to make money too. Thus enabling a virtuous circle of growth.

The answer would be: "Well if you are very lucky you might win $200 some day, enough to buy a cheap ring, but why not just buy one with your salary and play DotA for fun?"
It's the same thing for you :)

I've done this argument many times. Any cryptographer will tell you that humans are a terrible source of entropy and should never generate passphrases themselves. Time and time again redditors believe they are special flowers who can ignore the standard advice because they have superhuman abilities to generate entropy.
Whatever. All I can say is I hope you're lucky (or genuinely superhuman) and your coins aren't stolen.


Well if your passphrase is so complicated than you need to write it down then I guess encrypting it would be an improvement. But it's utterly assinine. There is **no benefit** and **considerable risk** over just generating a regular random BIP38 wallet. That's why there's no software to do it.

You (along with most people here) are over estimating the risk due to centralised mining pools. Having a few pools is less of a risk than you might think because:
* Pools comprise of independant entities who could decide to switch if necessary.
* 51% attacks are expensive to execute even with the computing power on your side, and there is a limit to what you can achieve with them.
* Any successful 51% attack would undermine the bitcoin price, mining pools and miners in general are heavily invested in the success of bitcoin as a whole.

I'm still confused why BankC needs to know anything about a transfer between BankA and BankB. As long as BankB is happy the transfer is good.
You realise the banking system runs almost entirely on IOUs (corporate bonds) don't you? That's why many here are suspicious of fractional reserve systems. There is no centralised registry of USD deposits that can be adjusted like the blockchain can.


No, this isn't how banking works! Banks actually have hard assets: gold, notes, but mostly government bonds.  When a bank pays another bank they either have to move one of these hard assets, or issue a corporate bond (IOU) to the other bank. They don't do this for every little transaction, but at the end of each day they work out the net amount they owe each bank and either issue or demand a payment to settle.

But: *I bet that your computer gets compromised when you connect to the internet. If it is you pay me $10000.* You probably don't want to play this one. Sure you're probably ok but it's a lot of money, even if there's only a tiny chance of losing..

From my reading it's 3/3 so you need consensus from all of them. Sounds great, right?
*However* the problem is that if there is some ridiculous law (anyone redeeming cash must provide fingerprints, say) then it is sufficient to apply this law to one of the three entities. If you don't provide fingerprints and one entitiy chooses to enforce the law (maybe they are being coerced) then either you comply or you don't get your funds. Simple As. 
In a 2/3 model (or even 1/3) it's much easier to get the three owners to comply with regulation (under the threat of jail sentences etc) than it is to get the population in general to comply.

Unless his money is where is mouth is you should ignore this crap. It's very easy to spout claims like this and almost impossible to prove either way.

You *still* seem to think that existence of CV will make KYC checks more likely to happen! That's not how it works! KYC checks will or won't happen regardless. When and where they happen address validation makes it easier for companies to do those checks.
Or you can go the other way. Let's kill coinvalidation. Great. But regulators can still ask for KYC checks, and anyone can setup CoinValidation2. Like I've said before address validation is possibly *by the design of bitcoin*, not by what any one group does or doesn't do.

I appriciate the time you've taken. I think though it needs to be discussed more widely.


So where's the barrier? Looks like 10 lines of scripting to me? I don't need to download anything, your protocol is open.
Anyway why don't you just generate a unique donation address per wallet ID? That's far more secure. Heck you're in the business of writing HD wallet software - you know exactly how and why to do this! :)  Here's what I'd do:


	
Simple and safe. Keep masterPublicKey secret so that nobody else can calculate donation addresses. 10^6 possible addresses and 0 storage burden. [Even this is overkill, just have your server give out a new address whenever its asked and keep track of the last deterministic counter you used, if you want to use multiple servers just pick another masterPublicKey for each server].


Let's say I'm a user that uses a single address and makes 1000s of payments. You'd see one multibit payment every 20 [say, on average] transactions. Dead obvious. Let's say he has two addresses that I use equally within the same wallet then you'd see one multibit payment every 40 [on average] transactions from each address. You can't tie the wallets together, but you can assume the guy has two wallets, which is handy if you wish to estimate how many bitcoins he has.
To tie the two wallets together I need to know the creation date of the wallet and have the complete list of donation addresses for that date (or the complete list of donation addresses for all dates, which is trivial to fetch). If I have a big enough sample of donation payements I can soon eliminate addresses until I'm left with only a few posibilities as to which belong to this user.
You might argue that I can never get /all/ this information, or I need unrealistic sample sizes. I'd say these are weak arguments. You should be private by design, not due to luck.
Looks like we disagree about how telltale the signature is. My instinct here is that it's much easier to find transactions than people estimate. You have a *very* leaky surface: known amount, known addresses, known frequency, use of multiple outputs. Any one of these is probably enough to taint your transactions and yet you're suggesting the combination is not leaking information?! I think that's disingenious!


Yes, it is the same risk - however I explicitly opt-in to that donation knowing the risks. You're exposing your users to the risks without evaluating or explaining them. That's what concerns me.

Not really. They have these layers because bank systems are created by evolution not design.
Here's what happens on a pragmatic level: If you send money to someone and the bank wants to reverse it, they [generally] don't strike the record from their database - because that would be a nightmare to administer. Instead they add an equal and opposite transaction to the database. A private cryptocurrency would work exactly the same way. Transactions would be immutable, but the master agency could force transactions through, giving them de-facto power to reverse transactions.

Ah this sounds like smart contracts. They key thing to note about these right now is that they are experiments rather than something you can make much use of right now. It's a fascinating area of research for sure, but will it come to anything? It's too early to say...
To answer your questions:


Yes - though typically within an altcoin blockchain rather than bitcoin itself.


The program basically says "This money can be spent once vinny is dead" so effectively it's run by every node when someone tries to spend it.  Note that this isn't massively different to a regular bitcoin transaction which says "This money can be spent if the transaction is signed with this key".


Yes. There's typically some sort of fee associated with putting the program in the blockchain and with spending it. You need this to prevent spam / denial of service attacks. Just like you do to prevent bitcoin spam.


No - if you attempt to spend before the oracale tells the program you're dead then the transaction would be rejected. Just like if you attempt to spend an output without providing the correct private key.
Actually by far the trickiest part of smart contracts is the interface between the digital world and the human world. In this case the "oracle" you mention - it's very difficult to devise a perfect oracle that correctly reports your death without ever making a mistake.

Duplicate messages, dead branches, etc are actually a pretty minimal cost - even for bitcoin. However mining power *is* expensive (and some might argue inefficient).
However the only reason why mining power is expensive is because it's an open system where anyone in the world can compete. FEDcoin would have a closed system where only trusted agents could mine. The FED would trust that these agents will not attempt to outcompete each other, or perform double spends, or any of the other tricks that malicious miners could do. If you trust miners not to do any of these things then mining becomes very cheap. Like you say yourself a single desktop computer could do it!

It's perfectly viable to have a cryptocurrency that's run by a central authority, or a few trusted authorities. Sure it's not bitcoin, and sure it has downsides, but it still has a whole bunch of useful properties.

Generally mining refers to the creation of blocks. The block reward is incidental and mining continue even when this becomes zero. You need blocks to give transactions an unambiguous order and thus prevent double spends. Thus it is a critical component.
A private coin still needs blocks to give transactions ordering and prevent double spends. You could have a centralized entity that create blocks, but then you need to worry about resiliency and fail-over etc. It's much cheaper to have a bunch of globally distributed miners perform the job. With bitcoin you have to worry that these miners don't collude to screw over the users (or each other), but with a private system you don't need to worry about this quite as much.
**tl;dr** Mining is critical even for a private cryptocurrency, however you can trust the miners a lot more so the problem is a lot simpler to manage.

Ah the 'ol USD dollar value varies therefore it's a terrible store of value strawman. Yes it does vary, but not much, US treasuries are better still, despite these variances it's still better than most other currency units. 
This argument is tedious. If you don't believe in the dollar (or euro, or whatever) then fine, hold bitcoin and gold. Your argument still isn't valid though until you can present a unit that does store value better.
@_date: 2015-01-28 07:50:07
Sure - and becuase they are working within a system where you can trust the agents it massively reduces the costs. There's no need to worry about 51% attacks, or finney attacks, or sybil attacks, or any of many attack vectors malicious miners could perform on bitcoin.
As a result there's no mining arms race, and the costs of mining get reduced from the vast ASIC server farms that bitcoin requires, to just a few globally distributed computers.
The benefits (global public ledger, massive resiliency, no single point of failure, low datacenter and network costs) all remain!


Yes. But private data-centers, VPNs, IT infrastructure, and the staff to run all this cost a LOT of money. A blockchain does not (as any shitcoin will demonstrate). If you can keep the security model of the former, but reduce the costs to the latter why wouldn't you?

So I pay 3 BTS and receive $1 (in BTS, so 1 BTS) + 3 locked up. To close this out, I pay $1 (in BTS, so 1 BTS). When I do this I receive back those 3 BTS. I can see that adds up.
So I guess the number '3' we've used is set by the market such that x BTS = $1. The key question then is what is the fair value of x? This is going to depend mostly on when you are allowed to close the contract. What are the rules on this? Can it be closed at any time? If not who determines when the contract is closed out?
There's still a loan component here. Sure you're borrowing not lending because of the leverage, so yes you must pay for this. Still the key thing to value the amount you pay to borrow is working out when the contract can end.

Ok so in a world where the BTS&lt;-&gt;USD exchange rate is perfectly stable, when I issue $1 of bitUSD I loan $3 of BTS until such a time as the bitasset is destroyed. I therefore expect a return. The price of the bitasset must reflect the amount of return I'd expect from storing by BTS / USD elsewhere.
Since the BTS&lt;-&gt;USD rate floats in practice, this becomes even more complicated. If I think the BTS is going to lose value vs USD I'll issue bitUSD, if I think it's going to gain value I won't. Depending on what people thing the future of BTS&lt;-&gt;USD holds, the price of a bitAsset will change.
It's very hard to value such an asset, but I'm pretty certain it won't be $1.

No - you're wrong.
Pre-mined refers to any system where some or all of the currency is assigned without mining blocks (or sometimes to blocks mined privately before the public release). 
* Blocks (well the block chain) is the method for ordering transactions in a decentralised system.
* Pre-mined currencies still have blocks.
* Pre-mined currencies still have miners and mining.
* Many pre-mined currencies still have a block reward.
Now you can certainly have a centralised system without blocks. However what the FED are proposing is a *decentralised* (but not public) system. This system still needs blocks, and mining.

The idea of "compete control of your hardware" is fine for individuals, but is actually a poor idea for companies - especially small ones. Having complete control is actually terrible if it means someone can bribe the rent-a-cop that guards the data centre in your basement to let them in at 2am.
By contrast aws themselves take security seriously ( They are able to implement best practice security far more effectively than a small shop like bitstamp ever could.
The final point is that bitstamp now use multisig. This means that you not only have to steal the key from bitstamp's aws server, you also need the other key (one  held by bitgo, or another kept offline apparently).

I guess you've never worked in the IT department of a large firm, right?
From the outside bank clearing is as simple as a few replicated instances of a large database and you're done right? Run of the mill stuff for a company like oracle like you say.
In practice it is nowhere near as simple. You'll have 3 front office systems, 5 global risk systems, a dozen back end systems that need to interact with dozens of heterogeneous end points (some of which will be people on the end of phones, still!). You'll need reconciliation reports between all these systems. By the time you're done you'll need a staff of 500 and transactions will still take minutes to propagate.
Cryptocurrencies can simplify this in a way no other technology can because they allow you to build a cheap highly available network where anyone can participate but nobody can abuse. This is the innovation. All the other stuff - particularly the ability for a matter entity to administer control over transactions - can be built on top of Cryptocurrencies if that's what the system requires.
@_date: 2015-01-31 06:05:21
You would still allow signing for transactions because most transactions would be peer to peer. You could however allow some master keys to trump signed transactions for central control (or a myriad of other ways, honestly this is just hand-wavy stuff right now).
You're still missing a key point about the block chain - it's *very* cheap to run. Far cheaper than any centralised data systems ever will be (remember there's no mining arms race with a private coin, and that's the only significant cost to bitcoin). I agree with some of your tradeoffs, but maybe a bank will prefer a blockchain system because it's cheaper? It's certainly not a crazy idea.

Ok this is the bit I don't get. If I short BitUSD I pay $1 (in BTS) plus $3[?] of collateral (also in BTS). I initially thought that when this contract is closed I'd get the same amount of BTS returned to me, however you're saying that the amount returned depends on the price in dollars?
Can you explain a bit more? Specifically:
* How much exactly do I pay now to short bitUSD?
* When do I get my collateral back? Do I have any influence over this?
* When the contract closes, how much do I get back exactly?

There's an element of jealousy. People see that others got rich from very little effort and want to justify why those people are foolish, while they, as skeptics, are wise, and that it will all end in tears.
You see the opposite here too. Plenty of people here are heavily invested in bitcoins, so constantly want to justify that they are wise few, and that the fiat system is inevitably doomed to failure.
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:08:02
ok - lets pretend that the BTS&lt;-&gt;USD rate is constant to make things easier. If I put $3 into a bank account I can expect to get 2% a year (say), so 6 cents. Or I can create a bitasset such that each time it changes hands I receive 1 cent (say) from the transaction fee.
If bitassets change hands &lt; 6 times a year I should keep my collateral in a bank. If they change hands &gt; 6 times a year I should issue bitassets. So far so good.
The problem is that anyone can create bitassets. How can I persuade people to use my bitassets? Well the best way would be to sell them at a discount. If bitassets trade ~10 times a year, then I can sell $1 of bitUSD for 97c. I'll take a loss from the initial sale, but I'll still expect to make a profit at the end of the year!
Similarly if they don't trade very often then you can persuade me to create a bitasset by paying me $1.03 (say) for $1 of bitUSD.

I'm still convinced that if I lock up something for a period of time I should expect a return. This may be offset / dwarfed by some shorting effect, but still in a stable world the asset should still work, no?

What you propose has a lot of complications (why is it fair to take coins after 5 years and not 2 or 6? Why should miners get the extra income? Does this create any perverse incentives? ...) and still doesn't fix the problem.
A far better fix would be to estimate the increase to money supply needed to beat deflation and bake that into the protocol, so supply grows by x percent every year. Some altcoins do this.

Closed systems need mining too - how else will transactions get included into blocks?
Remember mining has two components - the block reward and the transaction fee. I'm sure FED coin won't have any block rewards as there's no need for the FED to issue more currency (outside the usual mechanisms, bond issuance, QE, etc). However there still needs to be a transaction fee - mostly to prevent spam, but also to provide a small reward for miners.
And enough of the guns straw-man argument already. Most people who own dollars aren't even US citizens. They do it entirely through choice.

It doesn't really scan. For starters FLOPS are a floating point operation per second, whereas hashes use integer arithmetic. This alone should give you a clue - supercomputers and hashing machines are used to solve very different problems. It's not necessarily the case that one is good at the other. 
It's kinda like asking how many car crushers would it take to press all the grapes in france. Or how many diggers would it take to grate enough cheese to cover the worlds pizzas for a day. In both cases you could answer the question but since the tools are terrible at the tasks you ask them to do it would be a pretty meaningless answer.
Still on the crude assumption that the supercomputer is no faster at integer maths than floating point maths. A hash takes ~3385 operations, so 34 Peta(fl)ops is equivalent to 34 000 / 3385 ~= 10 terahashes per second. Cointerra sells 2 terrahash/s miners for $6k, so your $400 million supsercomputer is on par with $30k of mining hardware.


8300/10 = 830


830*$390 million = $324 billion. Affordable by the US / China. Just.
However if they use ASISC hardware:
8300/2*$6000 = $24 million. Most governments can afford this.

You're confusing popularity with price. As long as Bitcoin is more popular than Dodgecoin it will attract most of the startups. 


Why fix the number of coins being bought? It's more reasonable to say people speculate 5 million dollars regardless of price.


I can imagine bricks and mortar businesses using bitcoin to pay each other. Since they have to account in USD they will have to buy BTC to send, and the receiver will have to sell them for USD. This business model increases coinbase's (et al) turnover but doesn't increase the price.

Who do you think they buy the $500 million futures from?
Either someone with deep pockets and huge testicles who is willining to risk it all by naked-shorting bitcoin (Unlikely - this is risky)
More likely they will buy from someone who owns $500 million of bitcoin and wants a flat return for their asset.
So this product is helping the ecosystem by allowing Hodlers to get off the roller-coaster for a bit if they need to. This in turn makes hodling bitcoin more attractive.

The sad thing is that ripple have been trying to play catchup with the regulations for a while now (from 
* It was not until September 26, 2013, that XRP II developed a written AML
program. Prior to that time, XRP II had no written AML program;
* It was not until late January 2014 that XRP II hired an AML compliance officer,
some six months after it began to engage in sales of virtual currency to third
* XRP II failed to conduct an AML risk assessment until March 2014;
* XRP II did not conduct training on its AML program until nearly a year after
beginning to engage in sales of virtual currency, by which time Ripple Labs was
aware of a federal criminal investigation; and 
* XRP II did not conduct an independent review of its AML program until nearly a
year after it began to engage in sales of virtual currency, by which time Ripple
Labs was aware of a federal criminal investigation.

Well those points are all validly subsumed by "We think existing regulation is unworkable we need new regulation". I assume that by phrasing it as "we want regulation" / "we want more regulation" they are using words that might actually get people to actually enter into dialogue!
I've not seen any concrete proposals for bitcoin regulation so at this point it's hard to speculate exactly as to what people think it should look like.

You can give the transaction to someone else and they can broadcast it.
This can be used as a form of collateral, particularly with m/n wallets. Let's say you have a 2/2 wallet but you're worried your business partner might have a heart attack. You can each sign a transaction that will be valid in a years time. Should she drop dead before then you'll know you can get to your funds (eventually).
...and many more things like this.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:34:07
Well - For starters Bullion Bitcoin is an exchange.
Every exchange or wallet or *any* service where they proport to hold bitcoins on your behalf before you do something else with them *can and should* implement a system like this. 
You do have to think about the transactions fees and confirmations. However the exchange could easily batch multiple payments together so really transaction fees should be minimal. 
Don't settle for anything less.

Well right now only small players (btcjam etc). Governments run off debt so it seems likely that if bitcoin is massively successful they would issue debt in bitcoin (since they have to issue it in something!).
Conceptually there's not much difference between Argentina issuing debt in USD and issuing debt in BTC (or even Greece issuing debt in EUR!). In all cases the governments can't print more of it so if they can't repay they have to default.

I accept the arguments for a neat split. However I still think bitcoin is missing something by not allowing signalling and by not capitalising on useful node capacity for the time nodes remain within the rules.
Would you consider some kind of respectful-forking BIP? Given that most hard forks come with a lockin window, conforming nodes could:
 * Signal that they support a possible future fork
 * Once the lockin is applied, signal that they intend to fork after height H
This way non-forking nodes could prepare for the fork gracefully whilst still supporting signalling and extra capcity until then.
I get it's not ideal, but it's better than the "This chain is best connected to with XXX implementation" wars.

Well nobody is saying you can't do that. Indeed that's how regular banking transactions work pretty much - I'm sure you know. But one the great things about bitcoin is that nobody can say you mustn't buy coffee on chain either - if that's what you want to do.
For me, one of the things about bitcoin is that it's relatively simple. The whole world of cryptocurrencies is unproven enough without complicating things further - and if I really want more complexity there's Etherium. I'm not anti segwit as such,  I'd rather not get involved in the off-chain thing but if it makes other people happy then great. However I am keen to see vanilla bitcoin scale and grow  as much as possible. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:06:14
So now nodes voting for features that core don't approve of is grounds for disconnection? Isn't the whole point of these feature flags to help poll for consensus? 
It's trivial to build a node that doesn't signal these flags but still supports the features. All this does is discourage nodes from openly signalling their intent.  Who wins from this?
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:33:40
I see your point but all you do is make people dishonest about their intentions.

Hmm yes technically you're right, but "low transaction fees for approved trades, high for anyone else" is a long way from the original bitcoin dream of an open-to-all economy.
It's all about what future you want. It will be interesting to see if this works out, or of etherium (etc) will gain more traction because of the two-tier economy.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:55:37
Well the $0.05 transaction fee is a strong draw. Apart from hodling there is very little I can do with bitcoin if it has a $5 transaction fee.

Thing is, the whole bitcoin vs banking is false dichotomy. If any cryptocurrency succeeds then it will naturally start to attract services that look like mainstream banking. (And indeed might be actual banks).
We're seeing this happen in several ways:
* Bankers talk about investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
* Since the blockchain is public the AML regulations are actually easier to enforce than with cash.
* Lightning network and other off chain solutions look very much like PayPal / SEPA
* Etherium is pushing the boundaries on applying contract law to cryptocurrencies.
The only things I see that are counter to mainstream finance are those coins that provide extra anonymity - Monero etc 
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:31:23
This is kinda like denying global warming because it was cold last Tuesday:
There has recently been a significant uptick with fees - not helped by the fork. In the last day or two fees have come down, but it's far too early to say if this is significant or just a blip. Most observers believe fees are likely to rise in the long term.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:00:28


So far miners have proven to be resistant to being strong-armed. I think the pool model helps here since operating a pool is a relatively cheap thing to do - even if the mining itself is expensive. Maybe the same will happen with LN, I don't know enough about the details to be able to offer much insight.

That's cutting off your nodes to spite your face :D. If 20% signal for a fork an you cut them off - well they were probably never going to go through with the fork.  It just makes the core network weaker.
Worse, if people stop signalling then when a split occurs it will be impossible to identify forked nodes from non-forked nodes. 
We all lose from this.

Oh please for the love of all things good in this world do NOT encourage users to set their own fees. There are many flaws in your methodology (or indeed any semi-manual methodology). 
Speaking as someone who has been stuck on the receiving end of more than one "m8 I paid you" "yeah but you didn't include nearly enough fees and so it's never going to confirm" conversations I deplore people not to do this :(
Yes wallets need better algos for finding fees, but manual fees are a disaster.
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:20:01
Not going to claim expert knowledge here, but the ones I know of:
* It's complicated - compared to regular bitcoin.
* Not many clients support segwit yet, risking two types of coin: regular and segwit
* The promised benefit of off-chain scaling is still a long way off.
* It doesn't scale very well ( per transaction is larger)

(Well strictly the actor would need ever so slightly more than 50%)
This is why 51% attacks are a big deal and mentioned loads in various White papers on cryptocurrencies.
Of course you could attempt to fork and change the rules so they didn't have 50% any more, but that would be a different cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2017-08-08 11:11:29
I don't see this argument. Why not disconnect them only if they start censoring blocks?
Until then isn't it useful and fair for all nodes to be able to signal which features they support?
If you go down this road nodes will simply refuse to (honestly) signal their intent. Who wins from this?
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:12:06
The crux of the problem is that bitcoin cash is worth something on markets. If it wasn't worth anything people wouldn't mine it and the oscillations wouldn't happen. 
Given that it's worth something and uses the same hashing algorithm as bitcoin, we're bound to see issues. Nakamoto's only-balance-difficulty-every-2-weeks is as much part of the oscillation problem as BCC's adaptive difficulty.
Why do people think BCC has the value it does?
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:08:05
There's a difference between not being a fan of SegWit2x and not wanting to know who is a fan of it. This seems to discourage nodes from honest signalling. Who wins from this?

@_date: 2017-08-08 12:19:19
Thing is disconnecting dissenters that conform to consensus rules doesn't hurt them, it hurts everyone. Had the change been to disconnect them after a fork it would make complete sense.
Nobody is going to agree to different magic numbers, so no point in wishing that were an option. It simply isn't. There may be better options, let's hope we can figure something. The current method of silencing people who follow the rules whilst signalling rule changes is insane.
[As an aside, remember when some webpages would refuse to work with anything other than Internet Explorer - not for technical reasons but because the webpage author wanted it? That's where bitcoin is headed currently. It's a train-wreck].
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:08:45

@_date: 2017-08-03 10:01:44
Given that bitcoin keeps transactions forever in it's very nature - you question boils down to either:
* Does it make sense to buy coffee with bitcoin?
* Is bitcoin sustainable if it keeps transactions forever?
Obviously there's no definitive answer to either question - however bitcoin is built on the premise that you can keep things forever (and if you don't like this maybe ripple or similar would pique your interest).
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:22:45
I accept your arguments - however you can't stop people from using things the wrong way. If we do this will descend into a corewars style fest where nobody signals and so they only way you know which nodes are good is by checking to see if they have sent invalid blocks / orphaned chains.
What's the point? It's much cleaner for everyone to signal openly. It might not be ideally what you'd want, but it seems the least-bad solution?
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:42:42
I must of missed it :( Can you point me in the right direction?
In the short term it harms everyone by making the network smaller than it could be. In the long term it harms everyone by discouraging honest signalling.
I get that around the time of any fork it's useful to disconnect dissenting nodes. Having said that the bitcoin network survived the last fork pretty well. Not a huge surprise since as you point out elsewhere the network needs to survive far more malicious nodes than this.
What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:24:58
I agree it's easier to be a lightning node than to be PayPal :). But the requirements are still high (capital requirements, online hot wallet security requirements, network effect benefits from being a larger player, etc). Much higher than that of a bitcoin node.
The real question is will people prefer off-chain bitcoin via payment processors to on-chain trading with altcoins? Bitcoin is attractive but one of the biggest attractions is that there are no middle men. I accept that LN is better than PayPal, but it's still adding middle-men and associated risks to bitcoin.

Yes atomic away swaps can theoretically be done with any cryptocurrencies that have a nlocktime feature (or equivalent).
 No this is not why people don't like segwit.
It's worth noting that atomic swaps are mostly theoretical. I don't know of any practical way you can do them (neither via layer 2 nor via nlocktime). The most practical way to do swaps right now is via a trusted party.

The charts mostly show that BTC and bch partition the same value. Though the time scales are a little too short to draw firm conclusions.

Plenty of people claimed that bitcoin would have low fees - yet here we are! ;)
To me, running a lightning network node seems to be similar in complexity and risk to running a bitcoin exchange. These typically charge 0.5% - 0.1% fees. I guess this could be considered token - it's certainly an improvement on the 3% fees that current layer 2 solutions charge (Visa et al)!
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:21:28
Well yeah - That's because it's the main thing that's different between BTC and BCH (/facepalm?). If it wasn't for the blocksize schism we wouldn't be talking about it at all!
Conversely I'm bored of talking about who supports which chain (and who they work for), or how many nodes / miners / dollars support each fork. These things are literally sideshows to the main technical points!
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:42:54
The interesting thing is that while the transaction backlog has come down a lot, we're still seeing relatively high fees. A few weeks ago we'd see ~200 sat/byte fees for the top tranche, now it's well over 500 sat/byte fees.
I wonder why this is?
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:01:50
Yeah my comment should have been directed more at the op.
Still even with the most rosy perspective on tethers, I see no reason why they should be trading at $1. A tether is clearly not as good as a dollar, so it's true value should be less. Something about this market is very suspect.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:58:53


Interesting. Got any stats for this?


I agree. But at the same time this all sounds very centralised. Lightning run by exchanges is probably going to have KYC built in for example.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:17:11
You misunderstand. With S2X it's important that *you* run a node so that you know that you are seeing genuine bitcoin transactions.
The total number of nodes doesn't really matter, as long as each network has a minimum number to survive - which both networks did.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:10:00
SPV nodes cannot be arbitrarily spoofed. They will see proof-of-work from confirmed blocks for example. Very few modes of 'spoofing' involve hashwork so you're pretty safe.
Really the only time it comes into play is for chain forks.

Bitcoin spamming isn't free. Occasionally your transactions will get mined and end up costing you in fees. Bigger blocks mean more of your transactions will get mined which means you pay more fees.

Hmm if you look at the segwit spec you can see that it has to jump through some hoops so as to work with only a soft fork. There's no doubt that the hard fork equivalent would be simpler.
I'm not sure if you're an engineer of any sort - but speaking as one I believe that adding unnecessary complexity is the worst thing you  can do (well that an not testing enough). Obviously complexity isn't inherently bad per se, but it should be kept to a bare minimum!

Hmm - I guess I wasn't clear then, sorry.
I can believe that CT does not require a hard fork (though I'd love to see the technical details about how that would work - got any links?)
What I find hard to believe is that the block size can increase [for CT only, or otherwise] without requiring a hard fork. Could you point me to some technical details about how that would work? Are you implying that we can add capacity for new transactions somehow?

Hmm fair enough. But you can't prevent someone from running nodes, and it's not like the extra nodes do any harm.
We can take this as evidence of the existence of superfluous s2x nodes, but it's not really fair to make too many further conclusions. I'm sure superfluous BTC core nodes exist too.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:46:48
Ok under the narrow assumption that 1Mb is not enough capacity but ~2Mb is sufficient you are indeed correct. You don't for a moment believe that this is the case though, right?

Fair enough. You're right - I should have said that at best it doubles capacity.
Given that Bitcoin grows so fast (so chaotically?) that it's often measured on logarithmic scales, I don't think that instantly doubling the capacity is going to cause long term headaches. Hard to prove either way though I guess.

Not true. Those nodes are running effectively right now - as the op points out.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:38:19
I guess we do. It's impossible to prevent companies getting involved in cryptocurrencies - why even try?  Cracking down on bitcoin is practically impossible at the network level anyway. [Those controls will happen at the exchange level - and perhaps by tracking the coins themselves]. Anyhow if companies provide bandwidth, connectivity, resilience etc for the bitcoin network then we all benefit. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:00:39
This. If core would even clarify their criteria for determining when a block size increase is appropriate that would help massively.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:12:02
A large chunk of the codebase was written by Gavin and Satoshi who are no longer part of core - this is the great thing about Open Source software!
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:10:15
The problem is there is no roadmap.
Most big blockers would be happy with a metric for deciding when to increase the block size. All core have offered is "wait and see". Hence the BCH camp argue there hand was forced by Core's inaction.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:06:13
Fair enough - I agree with you. But at the same time I'm sure you see the irony of your post?


This is unfair. Even if you are a bitcoin loving merchant, the vast majority of the income you take becomes payments to your suppliers or staff. So the merchant has the same reasons not to accept bitcoin as you do to not pay them bitcoin in the first place.
Problem is if you follow this chain too far the whole thing starts to fall over like a house of cards.

@_date: 2017-11-07 15:31:09
Right - too many nodes run the same codebase and so if there is a bug it could affect a large proportion of the network. This is why we need multiple implementations of bitcoin.
However this issue is orthogonal to using AWS or whichever data centre platform.

It is equal. You'd expect 1/10 of each core node's date to be "leech" data, but there are 10 times as many connections - so the average is the same across the whole network. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:24:42
Cool. I'll put you in the big(er) block camp then ;)
Do you have metrics that you'd use to measure these things? For me number of transactions per second and lower average fees would be benefits. I've yet to see a strong argument why we need to worry about node count since we know miners and big businesses will run well connected nodes anyway. Do we need much more than that?
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:42:53
MAST and Schnorr are great ideas, but don't help with typical transactions.
Drivechains / Lightning / other layer 2 solutions are likely to be centralised. I like them but they are far from ready.
Only just heard of extblocks - sounds like a blocksize increase by another name. In which case why not just increase the blocksize?
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:54:05
Maybe you don't know this but most internet services run on computers that are owned / managed by a different company? If it's not Amazon it's Google or Microsoft or IBM or Digital Ocean or...
Next up: The blockchain is not even sensitive data, it's public - by definition. So there's no security risk. The worst Amazon can do is shutdown your service. I guess if you're very paranoid you might worry that they could spy on your connection (though it would be hard, and easily mitigated with Tor), but the data is public anyway so the value for doing this isn't all that great.
Yes outages will happen. Outages will happen if you run a node on your own hardware too.  What's your point?
Are you saying that nodes should not run on any of these services? Or are you saying that Amazon is somehow worse? Either way you've yet to justify your position.

Yes - that's exactly how the Ad Hominem fallacy works. Please look it up.


Some are. I could run up a million BTC nodes on AWS too, but it wouldn't make bitcoin decentralised.
And yes mining is more centralised than Bitcoin mining. It's also got a smaller ecosystem. Same as every other altcoin out there. It's weak, but it's not an inherent issue.
Honestly there are some real flaws in BCH - the DAA is relatively unproven for example, adoption is ropey, etc etc. Let's stick to the real issues rather than these childish side shows.

Stuffing blocks with your own transactions makes no economic sense today. Is there any evidence that this is happening?

@_date: 2017-11-09 13:32:17


True. But it doesn't have to be the most efficient scaling to still be useful. At the same time as sorting out these technical details, others are trying to figure out how to get Bitcoin to work for businesses - something it surely needs to survive long term. Short term scaling is for them.


Agreed - but I don't think anyone is suggesting that. Even BCH has a governor at 8mb. 
Granting some short term scaling will help business users, but there will still be enough pressure for these long term technical fixes to get built as well.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:29:19
How many times must we rehash this crap? The number of nodes does not matter at all!

Most people thought at the time that while Gavin was right about needing bigger blocks in the medium term - but thought that his bid for (eventually) unlimited blocksize was extreme.


The only failure in this sorry story is that of bitcoin leadership. Turns out coders make terrible politicians - who knew?
Around this time the Small Blockers proposed Segwit as an alternative scaling solution. This is neat since it could be introduced via a soft fork, but is far more complex than any hard fork proposal.
The various schools of thought became increasingly acrimonious in their attempts to persuade people of their vision for bitcoin scalaing. There were various round table 'agreements' that were attempts to resolve things amicably. However they never worked and the result is the landscape you see today.

@_date: 2017-11-15 16:26:04
I agree with much of what you say, the EDA sucked, the blocksize increase hasn't really come into play yet (it kicks in when there were big slow periods in BCH mining, so in some sense it works). Malleable transactions are a future hurdle for BCH and I hope they agree a solution. They could use more support.
I don't believe they are trying to innovate much over and above larger blocks - which they have achieved. Apple don't really innovate and they do ok, so I can live with this ;). For innovation check out Etherium and Monero. 
I'm with you that more nodes on AWS is better than not having those nodes. Would be better still if they were distributed more widely. As you point out though as long is there's sufficient distribution it's fine.
Finally adoption is the real litmus test. Bitcoin has a huge advantage here, so the fact that BCH has gotten where it is is a worthy testament. Still the jury is definitely out on this one - BCH has a long way to go yet.
See - let's talk about that stuff? Much more interesting than talking about what Roger Ver tweeted which is largely irrelevant to everything. I'm afraid I know very little about Amaury but I'll look into it. Having said that I tend to ignore most of the ad hominem stories, both for the BCH guys and the BTC guys, since they are mostly one sided and completely irrelevant to the technology.

Memorising your electrum seed is going to be tricky. Are you really capable of accurately storing something you almost never use? Most people write it down.
Here's the problem: anything you can remember well doesn't have enough entropy to be secure. Anything with enough entropy to be secure is impossible to remember accurately.

PayPal has 3% fees I think - all merchant side, and has much more adoption than Bitcoin. Unfortunately it can only compete on transactions over $150 at the moment - and even then PayPal offers some protections that Bitcoin does not (with some extra risks granted).
Still - imagine how valuable Bitcoin would be if it could replace PayPal?!

You can trust anyone because the proof-of-work algorithm is expensive to spoof. Apart from that the worst a malicious node can do is deny transactions. Malicious nodes are not a serious threat, and there is little harm done by trusting them.
Frankly this "miners are evil" narrative is wrong too. Bitcoin needs miners to secure the network. Furthermore the ecosystem only works if the miners' economic interests are lined up with the users' economic interests.

I'm not aware of any medical supplies futures market? Got a link for that?
Futures are generally pretty good for ironing out price distortions, which helps persuade producers to produce more. I don't doubt that some goes to waste, but you need to show that more would be produced (net) without the futures market - it's very difficult to show this.

It's a great set of points, but I think it's a unfair not to credit BCH with having lower transaction fees - at least in the short term, and not to mention BTC's large mempool.

Problems occur when humans are asked to generate entropy. Basically we cannot do it, no matter how smart we think we are!
With electrum seeds, electrum generates the entropy so they are safe. With  HD wallets the entropy of the child keys is the same as the entropy of the master - so as long as the root key was generated randomly the whole chain is fine.

This is the risk of any hard fork. The interesting thing about ADD is that it makes it much easier to keep a dead coin as a hobby. I guess it makes keeping your software up to date and running your own node more important.

Are you a tax expert? Tax has been around for a long time - most countries have solid rules on how to tax anything.

Bitcoin is generally taxable though. It's misleading to claim otherwise.

Taken to extremes yes - but that's not what was talking about.

If gradual scaling is the killer problem why not settle on a block size that increases by a few bytes every day until it reaches 2mb in a few years time? That wouldn't be hard technically. I don't think this is the real reason for being anti s2x.
It requires a fair amount of cognitive dissonance to say that 2mb segwit blocks are ok but 2mb / 4mb regular blocks are not - unless you subscribe to the never ever hard-fork mentality.

I think you're just shooting it down without thinking now.
Yes you need electricity, but you need far less than for PoW
No you don't need redundancy, read how the Proof-of-storage works. [It's moot anyway, if you could invent Proof-of-Redundant-storage and use that for mining, then why not? Think about it.]


As you point out yourself previously it must have a cost otherwise it's futile! I agree!


It's research - and generally research is a great thing, even if sometimes it's a waste of time.
Arguably creating hard-drives for mining is a 'waste'. But the whole point is that it doesn't waste as much CO2 as PoW - and we should all care about CO2 emissions.

You're right about regulations. You're also right about node cost.
Thing is that Lightning nodes require capital - which is something that few people have. With the added disadvantage that in Bitcoin there's no fractional reserve so we can't even leverage the capital we do have.
Lightning is a great solution - but it's going to end up being relatively centralised and look similar to banking today.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:49:49
Ashamed for not wanting to pay another $3 transaction fees for each t-shirt?
Better would be to pass on the cost to the users I guess though.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:52:45
Are you sure you're willing to keep your coins in an online hot wallet? I most certainly am not. Lighting Node hacking will be a thing - we should not be encouraging average users to run lighting nodes!
Assuming you're ok with the risks, your capital will be locked up in other peoples' transactions, so you can't use it yourself until the channel is closed. 
Remember it costs 2x bitcoin transaction fee to use a channel so people are going to prefer using nodes that commit to having capital available. Realistically the best model for this is a subscription model. You'll pay a well funded well connected well secured node provider a monthly fee to use their services. 
Lightning is basically banking for bitcoin.

Do you have lots of unspent outputs (did you receive many many tiny payments)? To check go to your accounts screen, select your account, then pick "show unspent outputs" from the menu.
You basically need to pay more fees for each output you have, so if you have lots it can hurt. Your best bet is to turn the fees down and be prepared to wait a few days for your transaction to clear.

@_date: 2017-11-21 15:19:17


both parties sign and exchange an initial Commitment Transaction.
Parties need to the private key in order to sign the initial commitment transaction. Therefore a node that is open to new channels needs to have this private key online. Storing private keys on online computers is risky. 
Therefore either you need access to an offline computer with the private key every time you create a channel, or you keep the private key online and manage the risks involved.
Did I miss anything?
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:56:07
I think we're talking about two different things:
* Keeping your private keys on an always-on internet connected host is inherently risky. You need to do this to run a lightning node.
* If someone shuts down their node you can recover your funds by closing the channel, but you now need to pay another 2xTxnFee to setup a new channel. If layer 1 fees are expensive people will prefer always-on nodes.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:18:15
Pretty sure it doesn't work like that. Your node will disconnect non conforming nodes and seek replacements.

Just use layer 2 solutions. I've opened a channel with my layer two provider and sent them a few hundred $ of BTC. Then whenever I make a purchase they deduct from the balance I hold with them but since no additional transactions take place I don't need to pay any mining fees.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:02:30
Maybe. Though I can see CME offering futures for ETH / BCH / whatever if there's a market for it. It's extra fees for them after all.
Incidentally you might ask what would CME do in a situation like S2X? That's a tricky question for them!
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:01:12
Can you? 
As I understand it, in order to open a channel both parties need to send coins to a multisig wallet. How can you do this without having access to the private key?
Once you've done this step you can operate the channel and only risk the coins in the channel - which is an improvement. Though you're still at risk if the counterparty is also your attacker, or is compromised via another vector.

* Shitcoin -&gt; unscientific / opinion
* State of suspended animation -&gt; evidently false since it had liquidity on various markets
* Traded on a major exchange -&gt; this is good, no?
* Pumped -&gt; subjective; all cryptos are pumped, it just means someone likes it.
* By scam artists -&gt; not sure what they are referring to, seems subjective / non specific; ad hominem
* Chicom miners -&gt; not sure what this is, but miners liking your altcoin isn't intently bad

You can't create an open protocol that resists censorship and then go and brand some users as criminals for creating transactions that you don't approve of. It doesn't work like that.

The problem with the never-scale school of thought is that it begs is question: is 1mb too big?
Big blockers also want innovative solutions, layer 2 and all that, but they recognise that even so there's room for on chain scaling as well.
Whilst there's no doubt that there are limits to on chain scaling, it's hard to argue that modest increases would be a centralisation disaster.
Anyway whatever the long term right or wrongs, the fact that bch has more capacity deserves a mention in your original list.

Possibly not a question that we can do justice this deep in the thread!
We expect retail users to buy / use cryptocurrencies - so in that sense they are a product that can be 'applified'. Conversely http is like the bitcoin protocol which so long as it works nobody has very strong opinions on - so I don't think that comparison works. 
Still Apple strategies work best on high tech luxury goods, which bitcoin is not. On top of that Bitcoins biggest issues have always been political not technical. These are the reasons why I don't worry about this too much, but I'm not going to rule it out completely.

You strike me as a knowledgeable fellow. Here's a question:
Let's assume for a moment that all USDT are backed by auditable dollars in bank accounts. Why would he value of USDT be $1? Surely there's always some risk that there's another claim on those dollars or risk that someone somewhere will screw up? I'd therefore expect USDT to trade like debt and thus be worth (optimistically) ~$0.97.
Any ideas?

If you increase the blocksize people might use it for CT - or they might just use it to do regular transactions more cheaply.
Both are good for the ecosystem of course, but unless you jump through some bizarre hoops I don't see that you can increase the blocksize only for CT.

Well - I'd *expect* those with poor fee optimisation to complain first since they are the ones paying the higher fees!
Still I don't think blaming the users is the answer here. Fee estimation is clearly not an easy problem! Perhaps more research is needed? Or standard algorithms should be provided or something?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:51:52
Right but the same arguments apply to diversifying your codebase too.

Ok maybe I'm being harsh on schnorr. The stuff I read suggested a 30% increase from it typically - which is definitely worth taking, but not enough to be revolutionary. We will need other solutions too. Mixing it with a more robust coin join is also indeed an exciting idea.

Yes CME takes no risk - Though they doubtless will employ market makers whose job it is to take risk and keep the market liquid. 
Note that the market is around the future price - not the live "spot" price - so there isn't the crazy tick-by-tick pressure that traders have in the current markets. You don't have to worry nearly as much about your traders being offline for 30 minutes if the contract they are dealing on doesn't mature for another month.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:41:34
I'm not sure what the point of these "my transaction was cheap / fast" posts. Nobody is disputing that occasionally you can get away with a low fee! The issue is that the median fee is both expensive and hard to predict!
Fees have come down a lot from the peak we had a few weeks ago - this much is newsworthy. But this needs to be shown via aggregate data, not individual transactions!
I'd also like to know if this is a long-term low, or just a blip before the next fee surge :/

Segwit and schnorr are forever too. Each time we add a feature we make it harder for new wallets / nodes / miners to be developed. It's basically a tax on bitcoin development. I'm not saying the benefits don't outweigh the risks but we need to be aware of the costs.

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:27:21
I doubt you'll get a neutral answer here, but to give it a go: They believe that on-chain scaling is possible (or at least possible in the medium term). Their primary aim is to scale bitcoin right now in order to make it useful for day-to-day transactions again.
As to the name-calling debate, ultimately this is extremely childish. Whilst it definitely irks some Bitcoin Cash users I don't think anyone cares about it quite as much as @_date: 2017-11-11 14:02:41

BTC refers specifically and rigourously to the protocol that is defined in the Bitcoin core Github repository.
Bitcoin refers to whichever cryptocurrency people consider to be the logical continuation of Satoshi's bitcoin white paper.
Right now it's hard to argue that these two are not the same thing. However fundamentally the core group does not own or define Bitcoin and it's possible that in future another group could create a branch of the code that takes over and becomes Bitcoin.

My point is there is no link between finite supply and value. Hence your original assertion (your time is worth some bitcoin because they both have finite supply) is false.
(Finding things in [near] infinite supply and yet still valuable is trickier. But I'm sure examples exist - bottled water, music, heating, etc)

BCH is Bitcoin without segregated witness and with larger block sizes.
The pro-segwit argument is that this enable lightning and other layer-2 solutions, the anti-segwit argument is that it's complex and adds technical debt to bitcoin. However these arguments are mostly unproven either way - Segwit has yet to see widespread adoption, and the layer-2 solutions it enables have yet to be built. 
Right now the market seems to be mostly concerned about transaction fees. BCH has far lower transaction fees than bitcoin, which might explain why BCH has risen so much this week. Part of this is because it scales better (for now), and part of this is because not so many people use it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:02:22

@_date: 2017-11-07 03:46:02
The number of non mining nodes is irrelevant - thus the "majority of non mining nodes" is meaningless.
There is a concept of economic consensus - the bitcoin that most people use - but this is not rigourously defined. It would basically be the bitcoin most people agree to transact.
Chances are that mining consensus and economic consensus would line up - and hence the longest-valid-chain rule would indeed be correct. But you're right to point out there's no fundamental rule to make this happen.
Regardless, number of non mining nodes never comes into the picture.

Given that transaction fees are higher than the daily wage in many African countries we're not going to see Bitcoin adoption there any time soon.

You can't really say this since it's possible that Tether buyers were buying and selling multiple times during the rally (this is typical behaviour for day traders).

@_date: 2017-11-08 01:44:09
Well different networks exist (core vs btc1 etc). This much is true.
The number of nodes is meaningless. Yes you can count them, and create some mildly interesting stats off the back of it. However these counts do not affect Bitcoin in any way, and so drawing conclusions is dangerous.
Validity as you define it isn't meaningful. Sorry. Miners get to define pow consensus, users get to choose which network to use. Nodes don't get to decide any consensus.
 The best advise is to ignore node count. Clearly all bitcoin variants have sufficient nodes at this point. Beyond that it's really just pissing contests.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:09:17

Why are hard forks undesirable?
An interesting example is wallet fees. A few years ago wallets could hard code fees to be a fixed amount and that was fine. Nowadays you need to calculate fees otherwise your transaction will never confirm. Technically a wallet from 2 years ago "works" just fine. In practice it's useless as the transactions will never confirm.
So... Given you need to upgrade anyway even if there's no hard fork, why are we so scared of hard forks?
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:08:05
Hmm nodes don't have access to keys though, and you can verify their honesty. You can run a node on completely compromised hardware without issues (so long as you can shut it down if necessary).

Ok - let's use this [definition of a standard transaction]( from the bitcoin wiki.


That would be neat for sure, and also great for privacy. However coinjoin has downsizes - it's far less reliable than a regular transaction. It requires a secondary network to negotiate, etc. It's far from simple.


Opt-in for who exactly?  Your node would need them in order to validate transactions - so it seems to have all the downsides of a blocksize increase. I guess it can be done via a soft-fork which is neat, but I wonder if the technical debt of all these soft forks is worth paying?

I'm curious - when do you think the right time is? And how many transactions do you make typically?

Yeah the last fork was interesting - I don't think many people correctly predicted just how big the BCH windfall would be. This time I don't think it will work out so well.
Still I'm not saying the fork will precipitate the crash. Though now you mention it it is a good candidate. I also admit that I lack the balls to short bitcoin at this point. Doesn't mean that I'm investing in it.

Technically easy sure. Do you think it will fly politically though? 
Hard forks are problematic enough - Trying to get backing for a Hardfork just to support a specific use case seems nuts!
&lt;pedantic&gt;it's governed by weight, but the result would be larger blocks, hence we can still talk about blocksize 
in this context ;)&lt;/pedantic&gt;
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:03:35
Gosh this is a Looong story. Let me TL;DR it for you.
Gavin Anderson (the second Bitcoin developer after Satoshi) argued that the block size would need raising. After failing to convince his fellow core developers, he started his own fork (BitcoinUnlimited / BitcoinXT) with a view to getting concensus via the miners' plebiscite (which was and is still the standard way to achieve consesnsus).
These forks eventually morphed into BCH, and S2X.

No it's not. If a node decides not to propogate a block another node surely will propogate that block. In principle it only takes one node for a block to propagate! (And even in practice just a few dozen nodes is enough).
There's no voting here. Take s2x for example - as long as some sufficient minimum (400 or so) propagate s2x blocks the chain will survive just fine. Doesn't matter if there are a million nodes not propagating those blocks, the chain will still live.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:55:23
You're making the assumption that both chains will have value after the fork. The authors of the fork make no such assumption. They are probably correct that only one will survive.

Well they have co-existed for a few months now, so no.
Well there is one thing - they share the same mining algorithm.  This means that if one of them ever massively dominates the other, it puts the weaker chain at risk of 51% attacks.
More pragmatically, a sudden drop in hashrate could cause medium-term problems for bitcoin since the bitcoin difficulty only adjusts every 2 weeks. This explains the current problems we're seeing where the hashrate has dropped 50% and so blocktimes are doubled. BCH doesn't suffer quite as much from this because it has adaptive difficulty.

Most BCH guys are in favour of fixing malleability, but would rather use a simpler solution. They feel that Segwit is unnecessarily complicated and has too many downsides (such as larger transactions) to be worth it.
The key advantage of segwit is that it doesn't require a hard fork. If you accept that a hard fork is necessary there are plenty of better solutions.

Instead of speculating, why not try it with a small amount, see how you get on?
The biggest risks are:
1. BTC exchange rate fluctuation (this can work in your favour! But it's probably prudent to not hold more than 1 month's worth at any time).
2. The security of your computer. I'd suggest using an online wallet with two-factor authentication.
3. How efficiently you can buy and sell bitcoins. I suspect the big exchanges will charge 5% fees at each end, if you're smart you should be able to do better - either by placing passive orders, or by using localbitcoins.com, or by purchasing as much as possible in BTC directly.
If it helps, the last guy I traded with on localbitcoins did something similar to this, he was based in Europe but would do contract development for US firms and get them to pay him in BTC. Seemed to work out much better for him than wire transfer.

Agreed - waiting for verification is overkill, double spend attacks are tricky, finney attacks even more so. Just verify the transaction is on the blockchain and you'll be fine!

You can only convert bitcoins into dollars if someone is willing to pay dollars for your bitcoins. Exactly the same for potatoes, and for gold! Fortunately in all these cases there are markets to help buyers and sellers find each other. In the case of bitcoin look at mtgox.com and the like.
For any question on legality, just substitute bitcoins for cash and ask yourself the same thing. e.g. can I sell a pirated DVD for cash? Well yes - and if you do it in the back of pub you might get away with it, but open up a store doing it and you're going to end up in trouble!
@_date: 2012-12-21 12:26:57
*Update: missed one, see below!*
Blockchain.info is pretty well setup but you need to understand the risks of using it:
First of all, blockchain only stores the encrypted wallet, you need the password to decrypt it. It only sends signed transactions to the server, never any decryption keys. **How do you know this is true?** Well you can look at the javascript code yourself or spy on the messages to the server - though if you're not a security expert you'll probably just have to trust the community.
It's possible that a hacker could change the javascript withtout you noticing so that it /does/ send the password. **How would you prevent this?** Install their browser plugin that verifies blockchain.info isn't compromised. Also pay close attention to the community and hope that someone spots it before you do and posts a warning.
A much bigger risk is that someone steals your password. If you don't write it down they can't steal it from your head, but they could put a trojan on your computer that records everything you type. **How can you prevent this?** Use two factor authentication will help since they would need the password and the authenticated number. This means they need to compromise your PC and your 2nd authentication device (typically your phone) which is much harder.
It's still possible for a smart trojan to steal all the data from your browser once it's decrypted. **How can you be extra careful?** Keep long term investments in an offline / paper wallet (but how are you going to secure that?). Consider having a separate device that you use only for accessing your bitcoins.
It's actually really hard to be secure with bitcoins. Currently it's the wild-west out there but hopefully with time these solutions will evolve. Personally I want my bank to hold bitcoins for me just like it holds cash for me, but that's some way off!
*Edit*: Almost forgot - you're only as secure as your weakest backup. Blockchain.info emails you a backup of your wallet. If someone can get this and your password they can take your money. **What should I do about backups?** Make sure your email uses a different password to blockchain.info! Store wallet backups on a different device to the one you use to access blockchain.info, preferably offline only. Finally if you're worried about law-enforcement getting hold of your wallet, bear in mind they could probably get to deleted emails if you use gmail and the like. If you're this paranoid then blockchain is not for you - look at using Armory or something.

Agreed. I'd skip the 3 slides on hashing algorithms. Just say that these algorithms are well understood and use standard logical operators and therefore can be performed pretty quickly.
I would instead explain exactly what difficulty is. You only have one sentence "when the nonce is found that begins with the proper
number of zero bits". In my opinion this point is actually key to deeper understanding of why bitcoin works. Illustrate how the aim is to provide a hash close to 0, explain how changing the difficulty makes this easier and harder. 
Also non technical audiences usually require empirical measures of what this means (e.g. cracking this would take longer than the life of the earth even on futuristic hardware, etc etc).

How are law enforcement going to 'prove' you didn't pay cash for an item? Maybe the metal was a 'gift' and you paid them for a 'beer' on a completely unrelated night? There's no paper trail after all.
I don't know how LE prove you did / didn't pay cash for something, but the same arguments would apply to bitcoin. You could argue that it's easier to lie / decieve about how you paid for an item with bitcoin than cash but not massively so. Either way it's against the sentiment of the rules, and therefore probably illegal.
You could argue that you paid for bitcoin, the rules specifically says no cash therefore you're ok. Legally this might fly, but I don't think this argument goes very far. Should bitcoin take off it's not hard to imagine them tightening up the rule.

The main problem with onecoin is that it acts like a cult. It takes the tropes [for want of a better word] from cryptocurrencies and cloud mining and spins them into something that their followers are willing to believe is real. 
You can harp on all you like about how there's no source code, and the only way of verfiying that you have tokens is by asking onecoin. It's pure snake oil. However it's tricky to win members round with rational / technical arguments because if they understood those they would never have gotten involved in the first place.

Adding new buys / money is most definitely beyond the scope of a bankruptcy process, and neither do the bankruptcy trustees care about market movements. The *only* reason to go with an Auction is if it would produce a better price - and it's not obvious that it would.

What we're seeing is two problems:

Ok let me rephrase:
As more entities transact bitcoin (assuming the majority of said entities don't run full nodes - which I'm pretty sure is the case) bitcoin becomes more centralised?
I'd always modelled "centralisation" as an absolute amount. Crudely speaking as the number of nodes, or node IP addresses or similar.
You're proposing that "centralisation" is a function of economic activity. As more people use bitcoin it's important to correspondingly increase node count.
I still don't think this measure makes sense. For example would you suggest that as more people transact bitcoin we need a corresponding *decrease* in block size in order to ensure centralisation goes up? This logic would obviously fail in extreme cases.
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:38:40
It's waaay simpler than that. We (generally) consume less power at night than during the day, and we consume more power during extreme hot/cold weather -  so an optimal bitcoin miner could mine only during mild nights (for example).
But that's not the point! The problem - as you pointed out earlier - is that energy producers don't pay a fair cost for the damage they do. The reason why this is extra bad for Bitcoin is because it only takes one dirty provider in the world, and all Bitcoin mining will gravitate towards that. (Unlike Gold mining, or operating a bank, which has to be domiciled somewhere).

What's the inverse of the Nirvana fallacy - where you justify all the faults in a system because it contains some good ideas?
There's a lot of sensationalism on this topic - but as Bitcoiners we do ourselves no favours by saying everything is ok. Bitcoin's security is paid for via energy - but there's no stop in the system that prevents it from becoming too secure (and thus too polluting). We do need to be honest about this. Economically the way to fix this of course is to ensure that all energy costs include the cost of CO2 emissions, but it's nearly impossible to do this on a global scale - thus we suffer from a tragedy-of-the-commons.

The theory is that MtGox trustees sold huge amounts of Bitcoin which cased the market to tank.
Unfortunately this theory isn't very scientific. It's basically a variant of the classic "anonymous whales cause the market to crash" which you see all the time. Though this has the advantage that indeed the MtGox trustees did sell bitcoins. I can't find any evidence that their sales correlated with market dips - other than generally they had to sell in the period since the peak.
Furthermore even if this was true, it's moot. If the trustees were told to sell then they had to sell. The trustees are not operating a hedge fund, they don't get to decide whether to sell or not. This is just business-as-usual for the market.

OK well now you're back to saying that you could execute the trade better than the trustee could. You can't dump 35k bitcoins on the market in one go, you have to split it up, which means you will move the market. It's very easy to say that you can do better when it's imaginary money. Not so easy when you're actually the one doing it.

LN transactions aren't really comparable to Bitcoin transactions. In principle you can have an infinite number of LN transactions for the cost of just 3 Bitcoin transactions as long as they net out - so you can argue that this corresponds to an infinite amount of economic activity. 
In practice it's likely that channels will have to be refinanced from time to time and it's a bit too early to speculate how this might work out in practice. However it's reasonable to say that if LN succeeds it will indeed enable more economic activity with the same number of Bitcoin transactions.

You're making the classic mistake of letting "perfect" become the enemy of "good". Why on earth would people want to run a node on their phone? Heck even my thermostat needs a server these days, and we're reasonably cool with that.
Similarly bitcoin is not an anonymous cryptocurrency. Neither does it do smart contracts or file storage. Other cryptocurrencies do this. There's no point in making bitcoin something it isn't.
Interestingly the failure of GNU Vs the success of Linux is a classic lesson in how not to build software. Check out "The Cathedral and the Bazaar". There's a real danger that an intellectual Bitcoin could be replaced by an inferior-but-practical altcoin.

None of those cases actually had 51%. In one case the fork was nevertheless valuable.
You are ignoring the examples where there was a 51+% fork that was more valuable the the original. There are plenty of examples for this in other cryptos - ethereum, Monero, bitcoin cash have all had successful 51% forks where the 'new' coin has retained the value (and hash power). This has happened to bitcoin in the past too, though it's been a while.

Here's the thing, I'm way too stupid to look after my fiat. I am relatively happy to pay a bank to look after my money for me. It means I don't have to worry about bank vaults, or armed robberies or anything like that.
I'm probably too stupid to look after my own bitcoin too. I can't wait until a reputable bank will handle them for me. Unfortunately that's not a great option right now, so instead I need to spend a lot of time studying cryptographic tool chains and the like in order to assess how to safely store bitcoin. The ledger nano is only a partial solution, I need to think about how I store it, how I store the backup. I still need to ensure every address and change address is genuine.  I hope I'm ok, but it's hard to get this correct and chances are I've made a mistake somewhere.

How does this behave in the case of drop-outs / connection errors etc? Does it mean that a failure of a single intermediary on one channel will cause all transactions to fail? Or is it resilient?
If it's resilient could it allow the opportunity to start a transaction on multiple channels and whichever channel completes first is considered done and all others excluded? That could be used to improve the resilience of the network?

What gives anything value as an exchange of goods? Well two things really:
1. It has to be scarce.
2. It has to be easy to transport, and divide up.
Think about it. Goats: Scarce but not easy to transport or divide up. Leaves: Easy to transport and divide up, but not scarce. Gold: Scarce and easy to transport / divide up. Same for dollars, and bitcoins.
Now the part you're having trouble with: How many potatoes can you get for a bitcoin? Well the question is just as tricky to answer if you want to swap dollars or gold for potatoes. It depends on how many potatoes there are (has it been a bad growing season maybe?) - but also on how many dollars there are (has the fed been printing money recently?) or how much gold is trading (have people who fear the-end-is-nigh been hoarding gold?).
Ultimately economics is a complicated problem, but this is not a bitcoin specific problem. The answer in all cases is simply what the market is prepared to pay. If you go to a potato auction, you give your potatoes to the highest bidder whether that's $0.1 or $100 - or in bitcoins: 0.01 BTC or 10 BTC :)

I feel that view of the world is rather naive. Mining difficulty shows no sign of abating, so if you stop investing you are effectively winding down your business. Conversely mining hardware can always be sold on to other miners so there's no /huge/ harm in investing preemptively, in principle.
My guess is that miners "hold" significant proportions of their profits in the form of mining hardware rather than as Bitcoin.

The problem with this notion of a guerilla backup bitcoin network of raspberry Pis - ready to take over the day AWS and Alibaba are raided by Feds - is that it's impossible to measure. It's a lovely idea, but not very scientific.
One can't even meaningfully quantify how decentralized the network should be. Centralisation has benefits (faster propagation etc), so at what point is it sufficiently decentralized?
I guess conversely it's difficult for me to say your pi node *isn't* helping the network ;) - but I'd certainly argue that it's not critical for bitcoin's survival in any meaningful way.

Bitcoin is somewhat beholden to its miners. But yes, if an overwhelming majority of miners / users does not go for Segwit2X then it will by definition be an altcoin. However if the overwhelming majority does switch over then by definition S2X will be bitcoin.
Once the market has decided *then* you can say that calling the other coin Bitcoin is fraud. Until then you can't. There's no point whinging about it, that's just the way it is.
They are free to launch it however they like. You can't force them to include or not include certain features - even if they are desirable. We just have to deal with it. Again whingeing will get us nowhere.

I get this. It's very neat isn't it?
But the downside is how the capital is locked up. Take the John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne scenario, you have 3 BTC locked up in the channels but you can only facilitate 1 BTC of transactions (net). Locking up capital is not an option for many people. Chances are there will be dedicated lightning hubs ("banks"?) who specialise in providing liquidity to channels - and will charge a fee for this.
But anyway - the biggest criticism but far is that it's not ready yet. Not even close. I'm as excited as anyone to see what the future holds, but its *way* too early to consider lightning part of bitcoin in any meaningful sense.

Glad to see you're willing to don a critical thinking hat.
I'd like to see any of these:
 * An explanation of why an economically rational actor would spend millions in fees 'spamming' the network.
 * A way to classify transactions as 'genuine' or 'spam'
 * Any evidence from anyone that they have been paying for malicious transactions.
Without evidence or explanation spamming is a conspiracy theory - you might as well blame The Illuminati or The Devil for high transactions. You've the same amount of evidence!
The coinbase timeline is highly circuspect and economically irrational. Even if everyone at coinbase is a die-hard bitcoin cash fan, they make far more money from regular bitcoin. And anyway the prices are fairly well correlated. Why would they spend millions trying to break their cash cow? It defies common sense. Without evidence or explanation it's simply another conspiracy theory.


No. Let's say a miner has 20% of hashpower. That means that 80% of the costs incurred will be lost to other miners. If transaction fees are 5 BTC per block you could only invest 1 BTC 'spamming' the network. At 500 satoshis per byte that's only enough for ~1000 transactions every 10 minutes. Anything over that isn't rational.
Also: If spamming was so profitable a month ago, why have they stopped?

Your wallet is connected to multiple nodes and uses Bloom Filters to hide the details of your transactions - these features help provide privacy. I guess if you're truly paranoid a full node provides more privacy for monitoring transactions. When sending bitcoin the privacy granted is the same. Bitcoin isn't especially strong at privacy so if you're worried you should be using a VPN in either case.


This analogy fails on multiple levels. Most people do infact accept cash and to a lesser extent gold whilst only doing the most superficial checks to see if it's genuine. Conversely a SPV wallet is just as capable of verifying that a (sufficiently verified) bitcoin transaction is genuine as a full node is - except for a certain category of 51% attacks that have never occurred.

51% is unlikely agreed - but that's because no miner has 51% hash power, which was basically my point.
The attack gets mentioned in the paper because it's something that bitcoin can't defend against. Spam attacks should be easily defeated by tweaking the economic incentive. If only we could agree how best to do this.

Patriotism is a relatively recent invention that frankly isn't much better than religion. 
The thatcher analogy doesn't work. Coal mining was an unprofitable industry that she basically shut down - causing many job losses and social issues. Bitcoin mining is profitable and can't just be shut down.

Hmm I think you need to learn a bit more about docker. With docker you never upgrade, you simply destroy the container and install the newer image. It makes sense once you think about it.
The corollary to this is that containers are long-term stateless. Long term data, such as the block chain should be stored outside of the container. Docker has mechanisms to do this (volumes etc).
Docker containers are signed and stored in a centralised registry, and verified on download. This is the same as Debian packages etc.
Docker controls access via sockets too. When you run the container you choose which sockets can be accessed from the outside world.
This is all textbook docker stuff. Suggest you learn a bit more about the ecosystem to understand how the parts slot together. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:49:04
That's certainly a compelling argument for segwit, I agree.
Still if you believe further capacity increases are necessarily then you need a hard fork - but scheduling the increase gradually shouldn't be a major sticking point. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:00:13
Well sure - when your business is no longer profitable :p
For miners holding bitcoins is essentially a take-profit action. Mining is a surprisingly marginal business so you'll find most of their assets are locked up in hardware rather than being available as profit. 
Suggest you speak to some miners. The ones I knew were always in a never ending cycle of buying hardware, until the day they quit the game.

Nobody gets to decide if their coin is "bitcoin" or not. It's dictated by consensus, and to a lesser extent the market.

Hmm a hash map is a better analogy. The unspent transaction table is basically a map from output-id to balance.

Anyone willing to call this? Bitcoin is 8 years old which by software standards is pretty mature! I believe bitcoin technology is more than ready for the mainstream. I'm surprised some of the developers think differently.
I guess you could argue that 8 years is pretty young for a financial product, and the biggest hurdles bitcoin faces are almost certainly financial / regulatory. Not technical
Just for fun: Linux was invented in 1991. In 1998 the Google founders built their company on the Linux platform. That's what ~9 years of software maturity can get you to!

Fees have indeed gone down which I'll grant is rather astonishing. Segwit adoption hardly changed though. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:46:10
Nobody is currently suggesting unlimited blocks though, and most people are in favour of long term layer two solutions. You might want to look into more detail about what the s2x folks are asking for - it's only a modest change and still compatible with lightning.

Right *total* fees are lower on Bitcoin Cash - I see now. Yes sure.
I'm not sure how that's relevant though. So far Bitcoin cash has mostly shown the power of the Network Effect rather than anything fundamental about how Bitcoin might scale.

Listen to yourself: Any way of picking a fork is arbitrary. Your methods were arbitrary too. Longest chain work is entirely reasonable.
Even if there are sightly better metrics, even if they were unclear about timeframes - is **this** really the fight that we as a community want to have?
I'm sorry but bickering over this is beyond petty and makes us all look bad. If you don't like s2x then start talking about that. Don't have a go at people who basically say they don't care one way or another. You sound like a religious fanatic.

I had a pretty good run as a feet-on-the-ground evangelist but that's a much harder task with a $2 transaction fee.
Not sure what's the next most useful thing to contribute. Fixing the fractured community maybe? Big blocks might not be viable but there are some smart minds and good reasons for wanting them. Perhaps after this fork shit show is over we can reunite?
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:39:32
Personally I don't see much centralisation pressure, but I do see a lot of pressure on fees.
But I agree - if Bitcoin fails at either it will simply be outcompeted by whichever altcoin gets it right.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:00:07
Ok fine I've no objections to this. However ultimately the concept of a meritocracy is subjective. 
Whilst I welcome expert groups contributing to Bitcoin's development, I would hate to be beholden to any one of them. After all they could be subject to bribery / corruption / coercion just like any group of humans.
Fortunately bitcoin follows a "let the market decide" model. In this world there's no such thing as a "contentious" hard fork, only economically unsuccessful ones.

I think this is much more about BCH survival. They know they need to fix the EDA before the fix, otherwise they risk being gamed by B2X and B1X miners. Frankly the difficulty games have been adversely affecting bitcoin too so this is a win for everyone.

That's the crazy thing about this argument. Both sides want bigger blocks they just disagree about how and when to implement it.
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:48:31
Right - decentralisation has nothing to do with number of users. That's what I think most people would say. (Which is good because it means that centralisation shouldn't be a scaling issue - bitcoin already has plenty of these so taking one off the list is great).
Hence I'm surprised by view to the contrary.
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:39:07
Counterparty risk. For example btc-e recently got taken down and people lost bitcoins. 
Though arguably the counterparty risk might be less than the risk of storing it on your own computer - by the same logic people tend to trust banks more than their mattresses! The catch is that since bitcoin is young and in a regulatory grey area in many places, it's hard to know for sure. Also securing your own bitcoins isn't that hard.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:18:07
Thing is - Bitcoin doesn't say this. 
I know you're trying to be witty and all that, but the thing that Jamie Dimon doesn't get is that bitcoin just does its thing whether Governments like it or not. Banning bitcoin isn't a meaningful concept (per se) - therein lies the genius.

BTC 'classic', segwit 2x and bitcoin cash all use the same hashing algorithm. You can mine them all with the same hardware.

The best way to look at altcoins is to study what they do right. "Replacing bitcoin" is more about economics than technology anyway. Most currencies aren't trying to be bitcoin, so if you start with this mindset you won't learn anything.
Here are some examples:
* Etherium has fascinating smart contracts
* Monero has facing anonymity technology
* Ripple is chain-less
* Other currencies have pioneered proof of steak
You'll learn a lot more about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies by studying what they do right rather than what they do wrong.

Hardforks are not just about block size. Any change to the consensus rules is a hard fork. Mandating that block 494784 has a specific hash is such a change.

It's much more likely to cost you a few % more, not a few $.

Most businesses achieve success the other way around. Achieve market share with low fees (sometimes operating at a loss) and then add fees later.
The other problem with the fees-first approach is that to some extent bitcoin is competing against other coins that do offer low fees.
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:43:34
You're missing the point. A spv node is just as good as a full node at validating transactions except for a few rare 51% cases. Those cases are hard forks and in *every historic example* following the chain with the hash power would be the economically correct thing to do.
Arguing that following the chain with less hash power because your full node says so might be technically correct, but it would be economy irrational.

Not directly - but if they didn't line up then someone could make a profit buy buying bitcoin and selling the future (or vice-versa).  So you'd expect them to line up.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:25:29
Right - but adding a few extra nodes to an existing network isn't going to make much difference. Conversely there's almost certainly enough nodes for segwit 2x to do just fine.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:23:56
 I agree decentralised network nodes is a great goal, but it's far less important than decentralised mining or making the network available to as many users as possible. Like you say the battle may be lost anyway, and that's ok. Miners and other big economic players are going to run nodes for us anyway.
The real battle is going to be over who can afford to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:04:27
Hmm - all cryptocurrencies have the constraint that consensus rules must line up with the economic incentives of the miners!
POS just changes who the miners are, it's a trade off.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:32:22
* Buy a mining rig and mine for core.
That's basically it. You can run a node, but really nodes are cheap and disposable - I doubt either network will suffer from lack of nodes in the medium term. You can throw more hot air in the situation but I don't think the bitcoin community needs any more of that :D
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:27:48
Yes - lots of advice here isn't very useful. For example sometimes keeping coins on an exchange isn't such a bad idea for the same reason that you keep your money in your bank not under your mattress - But don't tell anyone I said that or I'll be downvoted to oblivion ;D.
It comes down to what are you keeping your bitcoins for? If you need to use them on a day-to-day basis then android wallets are one of the best options and (assuming you're a non-expert user) you'll just have to trust the herd to tell you which wallet is safe. If you're buying to invest / hodl for a long time then a paper wallet is better. If it's a significant amount of value then a hardware wallet is a good investment. Etc.

My feelings are that Bitcoin won't be a particularly great invention if it can't support real-world use cases - though I expect another cryptocurrency would step up eventually.

The 10 minute block was a fairly conservative choice made by Satoshi. There are tradeoffs like you say. Faster blocks mean marginal miners require more bandwidth but give a better user experience.
It's worth noting that both litecoin and etherium appear to function just fine with faster blocks. 
At this point though the 10 minute block is quasi-religious and unlikely to change. Bitcoin will likely live or die by this block-rate.

Given that we can't navigate simple scalability increases without massive drama I can't imagine this hardfork going smoothly.

@_date: 2017-10-07 19:56:41
Running 'tar' is not sufficient to run a node - you need to first download the tar file, verify it, run tar, then run the application. You also need to perform extra steps to ensure the application has the correct permissions, and runs on startup. Finally there are even more steps to uninstall it. It's not rocket science, but it's more complicated than you suggest.
If you use docker it genuinely is a one line command. You should try it!

I'm sorry - are you trying to use logic here?
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:02:44
Not really. *Your* node defines the consensus you use. You need to connect to a sufficient network of similar nodes to propagate tractions.  The other nodes don't matter one bit - they could be ethereum nodes for all the difference it makes. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:11:50
I get that if you already know how to run tar, and verify binary checksums, and manage a Linux host - then perhaps it's less effort to recycle what you know to get things running. Just realise that you're leveraging a bunch of stuff that you've already learnt.
If you didn't know this you'd probably find docker simpler to learn than all that.
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:06:12
Hmm this is backwards isn't it? If 2X collapses then you won't need to run a node. If it succeeds however then it is important that you run / connect to a core node if you don't want 2X.

Some people like segwit and also want lower fees / bigger blocks. It's pretty simple?

@_date: 2017-10-07 16:26:27
Docker images do not have permission to access data outside of their own container (unless you explicitly grant them) - unlike other binary distribution mechanisms.
You should of course take steps to verify the container but you can be sure that no matter what it does it can't steal your keys.
[Of course keeping your keys on the same host as your node is perhaps not the best idea - but that's a separate point] 
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:43:29
It's simple for anyone to write code that mimicks a core node since the software is open source. No 6d chess required, just look at what the source code does.

This strikes me as a highly unlikely scenario - you might also worry what happens if Bitcoin Cash suddenly gets more hashwork tomorrow?
Ultimately they can only keep coins on one chain. Therefore at some point they will have to commit to one chain or the other - just like by now they will have committed to Segwit over BCH. After this point if the majority work changes then you (or they - depending on your prespective) are SOL.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:13:14
You could - but that's arbitrary. One man's coding hero is another man's coding villain. The rational thing is to pick a fork based on some economic property, not based on who has the best profile on {reddit / github / twitter}.

I'm just saying plenty of smart people like S2X. I don't see anything fundamentally "shitty" about trading off bandwidth for scalability. Sure it has risks but so does not scaling. Most bitcoin experts agree this will have to be done at some point, so really all people are arguing about is timeframes.


There's no defined way that "bitcoin works". The consensus might follow it or it might not. Either way bitcoin is working just fine.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:07:23
It's certainly true that the split community is bad for both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
According to this story Roger Ver's website once employed someone who then turned out to have a sockpuppet account on a different website - Can you see how tenuous this is? Yet based on this we are supposed to shit on Roger Ver? And this is front page news for Bitcoin?

If 51% of the miners print infinite bitcoins then they have created a well supported (and presumably therefore valuable) bitcoin fork. Whilst your node will faithfully report "genuine" bitcoins, it's probable that the "new" bitcoins have more value.

Not a huge surprise since mining empty blocks is literally throwing money away. Though it will happen by chance from time to time.
I don't get the FUD about empty blocks either - It's not like filling that empty capacity is ever going to magically solve any scaling issues.

If you want to support 1X the best thing you can do is mine.
The next best thing you can do is "economically support" the 1X network. You can do this by transacting with 1X, or buying 1X coins at an exchange, or things like that.
Running a node allows you to verify that you are indeed transacting 1X coins. Beyond that it doesn't help.

We all need miners to secure the network. The whole game theory behind bitcoin is that you make more money mining honestly than you do attacking the network.
If the chain splits then in some situations miners make more money attacking the minority chain than doing anything else. This is a risk for the minority chain.

Segwit 2x does so little it's almost impossible to classify it as "good" or "bad" on a technical level. This is purely a political argument.  On the surface it boils down to on-chain Vs off-chain scaling. In practice it's more a vote-of-confidence on the current core team.

If a group does this then the docker images should be as good as any other binary distribution mechanism - for that group's project.
If core do not do this then you need to find a group that does (and take care to make sure that group is trustworthy).

Sophisticated Viruses often have a command-and-control network. I'm not aware of any that use a block chain for this.
Viruses typically infect desktop machines which generally are not very powerful. This would make it hard for infected nodes to maintain a proof of work block chain it would be easy for white-hat defenders to commission more hashpower to perform a 51% attack and shutdown the network.
Viruses could maybe use a public chain for command-and-control. This might actually be a great design! Hmm :)

Docker should be as secure as any other binary distribution. It supports public key signing and all that.
Arguably more secure since the developers can pick a base OS that is secure rather than trusting the users to do this.
Obviously you can only do so much to ensure the docker host is secure, but that's no different to securing the host if it runs the software directly.

Hard to measure centralisation since miners are under no obligations to admit to being part of a group. I've not seen *any* serious proposals from either side to measure or code for this.
Whilst it seems reasonable that bigger blocks require more bandwith, it's not obvious that this is a significant centralising constraint.
It's worth noting that every layer-2 solution I've seen is considerably more centralised that mining is currently.

Strictly it's a bitcoin derivative, rather than an altcoin.  You can think of it as a bet on the future bitcoin price. For example, I might bet that the price of bitcoin on Dec31st will be $7000. If I make this bet then on Dec31st we would check the bitcoin price, if it's above $7000 CME pay me the difference, if it's below I pay CME the difference.
The clever thing here is that I can "invest" in bitcoin without ever buying bitcoin. If I make this bet I know on Dec31st I'll definitely have enough to buy a bitcoin - no matter what the price is. I could buy the actual bitcoin, or I could make another bet for Mar31st - and so on.
I may never have real bitcoins, but I will make the same real money (or lose the same :o) as hodlers of the real thing!
I know that the narrative on is that derivatives are bad - but actually this is a very neat financial trick that allows people to invest in bitcoin without needing the bitcoins themselves.

Right - it's not like vaccination at all. There' no sense of the number of Segwit1X crowding out the Segwit2X nodes. That's not at all how it works.
A better model is to think of them as independent networks. After the fork the Segwit1X nodes will only connect to other Segwit1X nodes, and the Segwit2X nodes will only connect to other Segwit2X nodes. As long as each network has enough nodes to survive they will be fine. It doesn't matter if Segwit1X has a million nodes - as long as segwit2X has the ~500 or so it needs to survive that's fine.
So stop thinking about vaccination - it's not a good model :)

But you can never measure it! If one miner wants to pretend to be 10 distinct entities you cannot prevent this. Centralisation is not the only constraint, increased fees will also cripple bitcoin.

There'a bunch of problems that people running nodes face. One is that they need to setup and manage the software, another is that they need to download and store lots of chain data. There are also questions about network bandwidth, connectivity, etc etc.
Docker helps people setup and manage software. But yes the other problems remain - docker doesn't help with these.

Blockchain.info is a pure client-side wallet that gives you full access to your private keys. Holding coins in a blockchain.info wallet during a fork poses no additional risks - you will be able to access coins on both sides of the fork. 
Web wallets do inherently come with extra risks over some other types of wallet, but that's nothing to do with forks. It's up to you to decide if you're OK with these extra risks or not
Note to people in this thread who should know better:
**Singing the NYA (or not) has nothing to do with wallet security**. Someone could be a signatory and still have a secure wallet, or not sign and still offer an insecure wallet.
A secure wallet is one that gives *you* full control of your keys - as such, it matters not one bit what the developers think about the future of bitcoin. You get to decide the future of your own coins - not them.

Well if you have two-way replay protection you protect both. I guess what you don't want is a transaction on the other chain being valid on your chain - but for this to happen you need to add additional rules to your chain.
It's a tricky topic. The crux is that if you implement replay protection you force clients to upgrade. For Bitcoin Cash clients had to upgrade anyway. For B2X there is no upgrade required (for SPV clients). Neither side wants to upset this equilibrium by forcing their users to upgrade.
Strong replay protection is definitely impossible in this case - but some sort of opt-in replay protection could be added by both chains as a soft fork. As you can see by the attempt by the B2X team to implement this, it's not simple.

Well it's sensible if you want to stop people from openly signalling. However it does nothing to prevent them running such nodes as they can just stop signalling as we see here. I guess it depends if you see signalling as a problem per se.

Right - The nodes should naturally partition into distinct networks according to their interpretation of the consensus rules. For example Bitcoin as we know it, and Bitcoin cash.
Whether this is sustainable long term is an open question, but it can certainly be sustainable for a short while. 


No this never happens. There are two chains with different rules. The chains can never be corrupted, but one chain could be manipulated and subject to arbitrary transaction reversals.

This is what people call a "51% attack" where malicious miners have more hashpower than honest miners and so can rewrite the chain back in history (though they can never forge transactions, they can still unwind them).
This is one reason why two chains are not viable long term.

The uk has had free (retail) bank transfers for over 20 years. The market was going that way anyway (except perhaps in the US). This is not a response to cryptocurrencies at all.

Well while it adds to the redundancy it can harm the network. Imagine if your node adds a lot of latency, the more nodes that are trying to use your node the worse the performance of the network gets!!
Obviously the network has to be resilient to these sort of thing - otherwise someone would be able to sabotage the network by running slow nodes. However it's worth bearing in mind that these Pis could actually be making things worse!

Hmm Flextrans is a simple fix to transaction malleability - check it out. Then you'll realise how complicated segwit is.


Yeah people say this like it's a great thing. There are dangers to hard forks of course, but there are also dangers to soft forks. One of which is the complexity cost.
The proof will be how much of the ecosystem moves to segwit / how diverse the bitcoin clients are in 6 months.
But the kicker is that all this is moot - let's assume that everyone moves to segwit with no issues. If cheap transactions aren't possible with bitcoin then I'd say bitcoin has failed and I'd expect another cryptocurrency to take over.

Good luck with that :(
The article does have some good points and some bad points.
 * Transactions are only reversible before confirmation and this applies (to a lesser extent) to all bitcoin forks.
 * Segwit signatures are segregated not removed, this doesn't make much difference except at a technical level. Users shouldn't care.
Fair points:
 * Bitcoin cash (and indeed most altcoins) have way lower fees than bitcoin
 * The user experience is poor for segwit, it's hard to use bitcoin for day to day transactions because of this.
There are also more subtle points where the article is valid. Segwit adds complexity to bitcoin. There is no viable solution yet to how Segwit can scale medium term, unlike Bitcoin cash which has plenty of room for growth - but then long term who knows?
Perhaps the ultimate irony is that the sides aren't that far apart. Sure segwit has some downsides but it does do a good job of fixing malleability. Equally 2Mb (or even 8Mb) blocks have downsides but they are unlikely to cause any significant problems.

Not really. Miners make far more when the bitcoin price goes up. Bitcoin congestion is bad news for bitcoin and will generally drive people to other currencies.

Does adding a core node at this point make any meaningful difference?  I imagine shortly after the split neither network will struggle to find nodes. A better suggestion would be to invite people to run core 0.15 mining software.

Seg2wit2x is a proposal to double the size of the blockchain. Technically doubling the blockchain size makes little difference - it doesn't obviously solve any scaling issues, but also it doesn't obviously cause significant problems. This is basically a political governance debate - do you agree with the current core team's direction or not?
It's hard to get a neutral opinion any more because the community is divided on this issue. For example is predominantly anti segwit2x, whereas is predominantly pro segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:44:44
It doesn't. I can't believe is still harping on about this.
Running a full node helps the users of that node (you - hopefully) validate that they are using the core based network. It does *nothing* to prevent segwit 2X from doing its on thing on its own network.

Perhaps fee arguments are unwarranted. I accept that we don't know what will happen. Still I feel we should be allowed to talk about how we might deal with fee rises ahead of them happening. I don't think it's unreasonable to bring up the issue. Call me a troll if you like, doesn't make my concerns invalid.

Apart from replay attacks - which everyone is vulnerable to no matter what - the users funds would only be lost in the following scenario:
 * 1. 'Attacking' chain gets the most hashwork
 * 2. User performs a transaction
 * 3. The other chain regains hashwork lead.
That's why breadwallet suggest you simply wait it out until there's a clear hashwork winner.

Then from your link:


This is what bugs me. I don't see why we should forgo natural organic grown of bitcoin - which has proven pretty stable over the last 8 years, in favour of the relative unkown that is Lightning. Yes there are questions about how much bitcoin can scale, but there's little doubt that it could scale some more from where it is now.
I'm all for Level 2 solutions, but by comparison there's barely an alpha product to try out. It seems odd that we'd want to bet-the-house on unknown / unproven technology at the expense of allowing no organic growth whatsoever.
I'm sure level 2 solutions will be part of the future. But I want a bitcoin I can use for something other than HODL in the meantime.

Just to be clear Segwit2X refers to a proposed bitcoin consensus that has segwit and 2Mb blocks. To say it's "completely unrelated" to segwit isn't very helpful when it clearly is.

Right - and how often do you need to do $7000 transactions? I'm not worried about fees today, well I am a little bit - but I'm more worried about fees tomorrow.
Something needs to give: blocksize, number of transactions, or fees. We've ruled out blocksize, I'm presuming we expect the number of transactions to go up (we want more people to use bitcoin, right?) - so it follows that fees must go up.
Sure we can get some small improvements with segwit, and with better signing algos and a few other tricks - but this doesn't change the fundamental equation.
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:43:51

Regardless of the exact mechanism of inflation, at any point in time any dollar is worth the same as any other dollar!
If you create enough new dollars you will erode their value, but new dollars and old dollars are eroded equally.
It is true that it's better to receive money sooner rather than later (you'd rather be paid today than next week, sure) but it's not meaningful to said the people at the 'top' get paid before anyone else. If your janitor's pay check arrives on the same day that the government prints dollars they really do receive this money at the same time and the dollars really are equivalent.

I hate to break it to you: Bitcoin will do nothing (significant) to help with wealth distribution. Neither will it break the existing financial system, or replace banking as we know it, or persuade governments to move to more libertarian regimes.
As you observe, wealthy people can just buy bitcoins. Banks can do all the stuff banks currently do (including fractional reserve) in bitcoins. The taxmen can still collect the same taxes in bitcoins.

Hmm I don't think you understand what a replay attack is. 
A replay attack I convince you to legitimately give me 1 BTC, and then I steal 1 BTC2X from you (or vice versa).  Here are the steps:
 * 1. You legitimately pay me 1 BTC to my web wallet
 * 2. I lookup the transaction details with blockchain.info
 * 3. I inject (replay) the transaction onto the BTC2X network using the public access point.
See? No Nodes involved at any point.
See here for a more detailed explanation:

Imagine that the value spent on mining is multiple times the US defence budget for example - at that point it's very reasonable to say that extra hashpower provides no meaningful security benefit, and is therefore excess.
Obviously pintpointing the exact level is hard - but it definitely exists!


Yes - but the value of the hashpower is attached more to the price of energy than it is to security per-se. So if energy is cheap then bitcoin will burn energy without providing any useful benefit. That's the problem.
I'm not saying we're there yet - but it's certainly a risk for the future!

What's this got to do with Xapo and Gemini though? It's not like they can influence the miners.

It's entirely feasible that at some point doing nothing will drive bitcoin into the ground. I think everyone can get behind not breaking bitcoin. Also everyone wants to fix it if it does get broken.  Problem is people don't have a single definition of broken and can't agree how to fix it.

I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that major criminals that use bitcoin don't actually care about 1x Vs 2x. Just like most users don't.
They just want bitcoin to have a reasonably stable price and not too punishing fees. That's it. As long as one of the coins comes out of the fork nonsense with a similar value to today's BTC they will be happy.
Even if that doesn't happen what are they going to do? Assassinating &lt;insert villain du hour here&gt; won't fix the price.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:33:46
You are correct - there are competing forces here. I'm assuming (based upon the view of miners) that bigger blocks would indeed mean more fees overall - but I've not seen any research on the topic.
Most people arguing for bigger blocks point out that it's the *users* who benefit most from lower fees. Somehow instead of framing the narrative in terms of what benefits users most, we frame it as "miners make more money" vs "blockstream makes more money"... Which to me is crazy, who cares if Miners / Blockstream makes money? Aren't we all hoping to make money here?

Hmm, that's a very negative spin. I see altcoins as Bitcoin's R&amp;D department - a place where smart guys can experiment with ideas without upsetting anyone. Most ideas will be terrible failures, a few will be good, the very best can be integrated back into bitcoin.
The real charlatans are those that try and persuade people to pay money for altcoins. However the coins themselves are a valuable part of the ecosystem.

IANAL But I suspect you'd be hard pressed to demonstrate "damage to a protected computer" in this case. Bear in mind that bitcoin is designed to follow consensus regardless of what consensus is, if the consensus changes it inherently *is* bitcoin. Seems reasonable then that attempts to change consensus are not damage / attacks / illegal / etc.
I accept that attempting to change the consensus is undesirable from the perspective of those who like the status quo, but it's an inevitable part of being a cryptocurrency.

Those banking apps are **nothing** to do with cryptocurrencies. Not even a little bit. New business model yes. Fundamental change to banking no.
Fractional reserve works just fine with bitcoin. All I need to do is write "I owe you 1 bitcoin" on a piece of paper and sell it to someone - it really is that simple! It works with pretty much any asset - that's why it's a good business model.

True. The attack surface is roughly the same. Slightly more with docker due to the docker processes themselves.
However you can have experts verify the parts inside the docker container. Therefore if you can partition the attack surface so that more libraries are inside the container you can get more expert verification.

I'm surprised at the unanimity against S2X - but nevertheless your statement goes further and says you "cannot refer to the resulting currency as Bitcoin".

Running miners helps decide the future of bitcoin. Using bitcoin helps decide the future of bitcoin. Using a node helps decide the future of bitcoin.

Whist you make some great arguments, some of these are tenuous - for example I don't think it's helpful at this stage to include hypothetical lightning bandwith in your transactions-per-second. Probably would be better to stick to the strong points such as merchant and developer support.

It's more like "require this block to be a certain value". That's a hard fork - albeit a benign one.

From a technical perspective any subset of miners requires a minimum node network to survive - but this minimum isn't going to be very large, indeed the miners alone could probably provide this network. Users (running full nodes) get a choice of which network to connect to. 
Beyond this adding nodes doesn't make much difference. It's economics that matters - i.e. which network are people actually using for transactions.
Finally it's worth noting that while users could contradict the mining consensus, it puts them at risk of things like 51% attacks. I feel this is mostly an academic point though since chances are that most users and miners will form a single economic consensus anyway - otherwise they end up losing money.

Yup literally anyone can hard-fork bitcoin at any point!


Nothing. But most forks are worthless so people don't care.
BTW a replay attack is not a double spend! A replay attack is where I (legitimately) give you a Chain1 coin and then you steal a Chain2 coin - a double-spend is when you attempt to give the same Chain1 coin to two different people.


Well replay protection is in no way required. If people wish to add it then it's entirely up to them - and yes they would need to develop this.


It's (generally) possible for the main chain to implement replay protection via soft-fork. The usual argument against this is "why should we bother protecting the other chain?".  This works for most forks as they are worthless, but for the case where the fork could have significant value it's perhaps lazy.

Miners aren't holders - they have bills to pay for Electricity and equipment. Because of this the rise in the bitcoin price doesn't benefit them directly.
What does benefit them is being able to take more in mining fees for the same equipment. For that miners either need more transactions or more expensive transactions.

I know you wouldn't think it reading but I think many users don't actually care about forks. For them delegating the decision about which fork to use to some sort of consensus algorithm makes perfect sense. Especially if it means they don't have to worry about software upgrades / bandwidth costs / etc.
Another large category of users are only in it for the money. I'm not sure what's best for them but ironically based on the last fork holding bitcoins on exchanges would perhaps serve them best? Sure there's counterparty risk but many of these users lack the knowledge to manage their keys safely anyway :o

You're confusing two things:
* There is a question as to who receives 'newly printed' dollars. 
* There's the point about dollars losing value over time.
These a separate concerns. Newly printed dollars are not worth more than old ones, it's simply nonsense to say this. Or put another way, if the US treasury gives you $5, or your grandpa gives you $5 from under his mattress - doesn't matter you still have $5. There's no difference.
It's not like the US treasury somehow magically dodges inflation either. If your grandpa's $5 used to buy a meal and now barely buys a drink, well that sucks, but $5 sitting in the US treasury has the same problem. The US treasury and your Grandpa have both lost the same amount due to inflation.

The previous poster is hoping that the macroeconomic effect of printing dollars will (eventually) erode their value. However there are two flaws in this logic:
* Dollars are not printed on a whim. Actually the supply is pretty well controlled so that the dollar value is maintained. You can quibble about who these newly minted dollars go to (the US treasury, at least initially), but it's weak to hope that the dollar's value will be eroded very quickly via this mechanism.
* Even with an extremely biased view of US inflation it will still take decades for any erosive effect to take place. In the meantime the bitcoin ecosystem is tiny (in financial terms), as things stand there's a ~50 year window where rich people can reasonably just buy their way into being bitcoin-rich too.

It makes no sense for a subset of miners to generate spam. It costs them money in fees that benefits miners who are not participating in this attack. Furthermore bigger blocks would make this attack *less* profitable!!
A *far* better business model would be to reserve x% of each block for clients submitting trades via a premium channel.
I dare say people are spamming the blockchain, but I don't see any economic reason why miners would be aligned with this.

Erm - I think you're confused.
Docker images don't (usually*) come with the blockchain data. They will download the chainstate on startup just like every other bitcoin node.
As a completely separate point, it's not unreasonable to want a mechanism for distributing the initial chain state. This would be useful to everyone, not just docker clients (*and you could technically use a docker image for this, though it's not a great choice). You don't really need to sign this since full nodes will compare the state they have against the live bitcoin network, so if someone distributes duff / incomplete / fraudulent data the full node will reorganise just as soon as it connects to the live network.
SPV nodes are a separate issue, let's keep them out of scope for now.

How does it matter who runs the node? As long as the nodes are on separate hosts and all that it doesn't make one jot of difference who ran them.
I guess you could argue that the person who ran them might shut them all down together under some circumstance. I guess this is a risk, but so long as the nodes are running they help the network out just fine.

A better analogy is advertising "chips". In the US you'd be buying thin round slices of crisp potato, in the UK you'd get French Fries.

Unlikely that 2mb would make any meaningful difference either way. It won't lead to centralisation and neither will it lower fees much.
At this point it's mostly a political battle about the future direction of bitcoin. A 2mb hard fork opens the door to more capacity increases in future. Rejecting this means the we're betting on future layer 2 solutions to provide capacity.

A zero knowledge proof is a way of proving that you know the answer to a question without giving anyway what the answer actually is.

Right - but to do this your spam must also cost 200 satoshis.  You can't produce 5 satoshi spam and expect people to pay 200, they will simply pay 6!
Assuming you have 20% hashpower you need to somehow ensure that you get 5 'genuine' transactions per single spam transaction, meanwhile competing miners will happily stuff their blocks with your spam if there's no better 'genuine' transactions. 
*Even* if this is viable, making blocks bigger would make this model harder since it relies on a 1Mb pool of 'genuine' transactions all the time. If you require that pool to be bigger then spamming is even harder.

Yes you do.
Stop trying to paint these things as so black and white. By that logic Etherium Classic is the "true" Etherium because it adheres to some older rules.
Fact is you can't know which is the "trunk" and which is the "branch" until after the fork has occurred. Even then there may be an extended period of ambiguity until the market decides.
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:35:09
Point is there's nothing you can do until the fork occurs.
What you could do is partition the connected nodes into two lists (2x vs normal) so that when the fork occurs they can quickly reconfigure their connections.  
Unfortunately if you ban them upfront it persuades the nodes to stop signaling and makes such a technical fix impossible.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:32:29


I don't think anyone disputes this. It was only ever a research idea. 


Well bitcoin is not anonymous at all. Are you saying it's unsuitable for enterprises? Actually many real world markets are completely public (people can see exactly who is buying and selling).

One reason is that in financial circles "bitcoin" is tainted (think Silk Road, scams, BitLicense. etc). Banks Want to get involved but aren't able to touch Bitcoin itself just yet without facing regulatory hurdles. Investing in blockchain technology means they can pick up all the skills they need for bitcoin without actually having to square up to the regulators just yet.

The best advice for long term investors is to put your bitcoin into a wallet where you own the key and wait.
If you wish to capitalise on the fork then the best thing is to put your coins onto an exchange that plans to support both forks. Note that this is a risky strategy.
If you need to actually transact Bitcoin during the fork then you should download a full wallet and run that. Beware that you will be at the risk of Replay attacks.
There is no point in running a node unless you intend to use it.

When though? If this issue is serious enough to cause a huge schism in the bitcoin community then surely it's worth prioritizing. Even if the answer is "not now" - it should be a more scientific "This is what we'll do, and this is when we'll do it".
Part of the problem is the bull market. In a bear market making bitcoin more attractive to actual users would doubtless be more important to everyone.

They aren't choosing the longest chain, they are choosing the chain with the most work - or biggest share of the mining market. By this metric [BTC is way longer than BCH]( Any metric is is somewhat arbitrary, but this seems reasonable. Most people conjecture that miners follow the most valuable coin [until the difficulty adjusts], so the mining market should line up with the trading market.

Smart contracts are enforced by 51% consensus and the 'law' is the law of the program that underlies them. All this works beautifully.
The problem is scope. To carry on with this terrible metaphor, smart contracts are limited to the 'jurisdiction' of the particular blockchain they are made in. The only 'evidence' the contracts can consider is that which is directly observable by the blockchain, and the only 'ruling' they can reach is one that can be written on the blockchain.
This rather limits how useful they can be in practice.

Good question.
Actually 51% attacks only really apply to decentralised systems. With a centralised ledger there's no real equivalent of a 51% attack. 
The closest thing would be if one branch / region was unable to communicate with the rest of the bank's infrastructure (perhaps due to a telecoms failure?). In this case most banks would simply refuse to operate during the outage, but if you were cunning (and the bank was stupid) you might be able to withdraw twice during such an outage.
It's worth noting that this is an *advantage* of centralized systems. There generally isn't any problem with working out consensus.

* When bitcoin forks there are effectively two copies of the bitcoins - one on each fork.
* It's hard to predict if a bitcoins on a fork will be worth anything. 
* The only way to access bitcoins on a fork is to have them stored in a wallet that supports that fork.
* If you're using someone else's wallet (e.g. an online coin service or any sort) you can't be sure if they will let you access forked coins.
* Therefore if you're wanting to ensure access to forked coins, you need to store them on a wallet that you have full control over.
Is the hassle worth it? Well you need to weigh up the time and effort it will take you to learn these things vs the future value of the forked coins. It's kinda hard to predict. What you can be certain of though is that that BCC is worth anything significant then people will make the effort to extract the value [Though they might not return that value to you].

I don't think this is a 'feature' more a consequence of the bitcoin protocol. The point is that we cannot hope to prevent replace-by-fee so we have to live with it. The best way to avoid this sort of double spend is to wait for a confirmation.
For what its worth: I *think* most nodes wont accept a replace-by-fee transaction, however a mining pool could always choose to implement these - and profit from doing so.

Of course you can have such technology that is centrally issued. Let me explain how:
Take bitcoin, but instead of having a strict mathematical formula to dictate the block reward, allow the owner of some master key to dictate what each block reward would be. All you have to do is persuade people to use this currency (maybe by allowing tax payments with it) and bam - now you have cryptofiat.
It's not bitcoin but it is a cryptocurrency - actually it's not very different from many premined altcoins that already exist

Nodes never have an invective to allow replace by fee, it's only ever bad for the network as a whole, so you can reasonably assume no nodes will allow this.
However miners can profit from replace by fee. For replace by fee to be effective you need to send your transactions directly to the mining pools that will accept it. The chance of success is proportional to the hash power of those mining pools.

Clearly you've never worked in an enterprise environment. Enterprise software costs orders of magnitude more than the equivalent in a small startup. Sometimes justifiably so (compliance, audit, datacenter, security, ...) and sometimes just because of middle-management crap. Nevertheless this is the price of enterprise. Until you understand that even the simplest of database systems cost a large enterprise many millions you're not really going to 'get' the gist of the paper.
Still, let's work through your example:


To fetch transaction data in a classic oracle system:
* Find the API for the specific database with the transactions
* Develop a query that efficiently fetches the data you need. How are you going to cope with realtime updates? Are there any fiddly problems to do with batching up the data?
* Create a new user with permission to connect to that database and view transaction data.
* Find a host within the same datacenter as the databse to run the query *OR* check with the network team that it's ok to run the query remotely
* Liase with the DBAs and determine if your query will put an unacceptable load on the system
* Work through the security implications of distributing the data from the report.
* Work out how to handle network disconnects / datacenter failover / resiliency
* Work out how to handle amends of historic data.
To fetch transaction data in a blockchain system:
* Run a full node.

This is research. In a world where all data is shared, security must be handled via encryption. Does it do this today? no. Could it tomorrow? maybe. Could you do this in Oracle at the same cost? Perhaps. Like I say, it's the weakest point in the whole idea for sure.


I love the way that in answering this question you reference a whole bunch of crap that is often necessary in oracle in order to achieve resiliency and scalability. 
The beauty of bitcoind is that you'd never need virtualisation, or mesh replication, or read-only nodes for each client, or a HA core.   **This** is what you don't need to do with bitcoind!!
Don't try and claim this is "boringly easy" - how many years of training / experience did it take you to get to that point? Or put another way, how much are people willing to pay you to set this up? How much would they pay you to setup a bitcoind node?


Bitcoind is tested thoroughly every day. Still try to remember this is a research paper, bitcoind has clearly been demonstrated as a proof of concept.


Oracle (PostgresSQL / MySql / etc) are *not* peer to peer data stores. Perhaps bitcoind didn't innovate and there are alternative peer-to-peer data stores that should be considered. Still I'd argue that bitcoin is one of the biggest and most successful. That's why it's interesting to look at.

So the author of the article appears to have chosen to use 'drawdown' as his metric. This metric looks at the most you could lose in a given period - assuming you buy at the highest point and sell at the lowest point after the peak.
Obviously no investment looks good on this metric - but wait, don't dismiss the metric just yet. Drawdown is a great metric of variance, and many portfolio traders or technical analysts will consider it seriously. Why? Well it basically tells you how risky your investment is. We all know bitcoin is *extremely* risky, and this article goes a step further and measures just how risky it is.
So don't line up to laugh at this idea. Yes he should have listed the drawdown for other investments so we can compare - but that's a simple exercise you can do yourself if you are interested. The numbers are still interesting. If you don't understand that there are extreme risks to holding bitcoin then it is *you* who is the fool!

Good question. I think the answers are twofold:
The big story is settlement. The stock market involves 1000s of people trading 1000s of products with each other. Creating systems that track who owns what is expensive. Worse every bank and broker has their own system. You cannot begin to imagine how many people work ensuring these systems talk to each other and fixing errors that come up. It's insanely expensive.
Wouldn't it be great if there were a standard protocol where you could broadcast transactions and have some open publicly owned distributed system net up the trades and work out in realtime who owned what? Enter blockchain technology.
There are two main criticisms of this by bitcoiners:
*Why not use the blockchain?* Well it would be possible, but it's not really what the blockchain was designed for. You can't hold stocks anonymously for starters, and it's politically tainted - more on this later.
*Surely a classical distributed database would be cheaper?* Personally I feel this has yet to be proven, 1001 altcoins demonstrate just how cheap blockchains are to operate. Even if you accept that classical databases are cheaper you have the problem that everyone has to agree on the same platform (Oracle vs DB2 vs MySQL vs Hardoop vs MongoDB vs...), and you need to agree on a neutral trusted party to oversee the whole thing, which rapidly leads you into Holy Wars. With a blockchain you can present a protocol and allow the banks to implement it however they please.
The other story is that banks are perhaps investigating how they might some day integrate bitcoin and other digital assets into their technology. The problem with Bitcoin is that it's currently tainted by money laundering / drug dealing / etc, so banks can't touch it without entering into a regulatory shitstorm. However they can poke around the edges and learn how to use it. One day the regulatory view might clear up, in which case banks who have been using 'blockchain technology' for a while will be in a great place to start trading Bitcoin itself.

You're right about security. Banks would have to buy into the fact that data is encrypted rather than permissioned. Will they do this? Not easily, but it's not impossible either. The up side is that once you buy into this model, administering the system is trivial - so there's a huge cost saving *if* you can accept the model.
As for running bicoind vs running oracle, well this is slam-dunk in bitcoind's favour. I guess you've never setup oracle? One does not simply 'just replicate the database', setting up these systems usually requires a specific operating system, often with a specific hardware configuration. Bitcoind on the other hand is designed from the ground up to be replicated readily.
Network traffic: Possibly slightly in oracles favour. However one advantage for bitcoind is that the load profile is constant. With oracle you could break the network one morning with a bad query, with bitcoind it either works or it doesn't.  There's nothing to surprise you. Network traffic over a LAN/WAN is rarely a limiting factor, but surprise loads can be devastating.
I don't know why you're worried about the local node. The point of bitcoind is that nodes are cheap and expendible. If I kill the node I only affect my query. Compare this to taking down a centralised database server. It's a massive advantage in bitcoin's favour.
"cooking the data" as you put it is a draw. Yes you have to write a library to do the cooking, but this can easily be shared (banks do this already with databases, trust me). The real advantage is that you know the worst you can do is break your local store, though you do have to do more heavy lifting locally. With a database it /may/ be possible to share some of the heavy lifting, but you need expert DBA help and you run the risk of taking down the global system with *any* query.

The euro is big, but Greece is economically insignificant. Even Spain and Portugal aren't that big of a deal. (Italy is the one to watch). But anyway banking as an industry has survived worse and will survive this just fine.
I enjoy watching Kim as much as anyone else, but I've learnt over the years that he enjoys creating a circus show out of what sometimes (not always, granted) is actually very mundane. I expect the political fallout will be spectacular here, but the economic impact won't be so large unless you are Greek or own Greek assets.
Prediction: Greece won't be appeased. They will either leave the euro or rattle a lot of sabres but carry on with austerity. If they leave the euro it won't be a big deal since it's been on the cards for so long that everyone is ready for it.

You still don't get it. Oracle does *not* do clearing out of the box.

You're not quite grasping the essence of the paper. They aren't talking about using a specific blockchain. They want to develop a custom blockchain that satisfies their needs. So in particular it would definitely be trusted, and could include any of the features you ask for it they really matter (most of the thing you list don't).
The paper is research so it's very non specific. However the cost of a customized block chain could easily be cheaper than an enterprise database solution. A clearing system for a bank will probably cost 100s of millions to develop and a few tens of million each year to run. (The actual cost of the software license is peanuts in all of this). A handful of smart developers could write a custom blockchain for 'only' 10 million, and if it only costs a million a year to run it already looks like a great deal. The trickiest bit of enterprise software is to make sure it scales reliably and to keep it running without any outages. Something blockchains handle exceedingly well for exceedingly little cost.

You are positing that a private centralised or sharded database is cheaper to setup and run than a blockchain. If a blockchain is cheaper to setup and run then it would beat a traditional database for many of the categories where you said "no".
Setting up shared databases across companies that mostly trust each other is unbelievably expensive (sure it ought not to be, but that's just how the private sector works). Setting up blockchains could be much cheaper (granted it's very early days to conclude). Herein likes the attraction of "blockchain technology".

I can only speak for western markets. They got significantly more serious about tackling insider trading in the 1980s, but yes since then the markets have been equally efficient over the last 20-30 years.


Ah you're of the opinion that fiat is doomed? Well you can't really show such systematic risk in a stock price since stock is priced in fiat. 
The way you'd see such risk is by comparing the price of companies that deal with hard assets (oil companies, mining companies) vs companies that deal with services.

My point: Compared to the risk of holding bitcoins, it's not going to matter much whether you choose USD / GBP /EUR / AUD. *Any* of those is a far better hedge of MNT  than BTC is.

Right. Neither do most users. This is actually a terrible interface.
Better would be to have a slider where you can adjust the expected confirmation time. Or even better just stuck to normal / priority and leave it at that.

Great analogy - but this is in danger of becoming yet another circle jerk.
Most people are not bloggers and most blogs are not worth reading. Whilst it's great that people have the opportunity to blog if they wish, mainstream news media still has its place.
It's the same with bitcoin. It's great that you can be your own bank if you want, but it's not for everyone. Classical banking models will very much have a place in a cryptocurrency world.
@_date: 2017-06-26 06:03:32
I'm sorry but I'm going to have to call it. This is **not** a good interface. What's the point of having people type in a number here? You can only get it wrong! Especially in satoshis per byte - a unit so cryptic it makes Furlongs per fortnight look simple to understand. Most users won't understand what it means.
They should offer normal / priority and leave it at that. If you must tinker with a pretty simple interface then offer a slider for *how long* you want the transaction to take. Explain the fee breakdown / calculation in detail. Don't let users type it in though. It's a terrible idea.   
@_date: 2015-02-09 11:27:35
Good question.
First thing - there's nothing special about the day all the bitcoin gets mined. The reward halves every 4 years so in ~25 years it will be only 0.4 BTC per block. At that point (if not before) it starts to become pretty insignificant. 
There are really only a few possible outcomes:
* Significant numbers of Miners stop mining: as a result bitcoin becomes subject to mining based attack (private blockchains, double spends, etc). If this is a problem bitcoin will likely be replaced by an alternative cryptocurrency.
* Significant numbers of Miners stop mining: However the current mining difficulty tunrs out to be overkill. Private chains are unfeasible at far lower difficulties than where we are at. If people are careful about not accepting zero-confirm trades then it's still safe to use bitcion. Not much changes.
* Bitcoin service providers offer contracts to mining companies to provide mining services in order to secure the network. Bitcoin will have to respond to criticisms that this effectively provides centralization.
* Miners collude to demand more fees from users in order to keep mining profitable. This would have knock-on implications for what sorts of service are feasible in bitcoin.
* The number of transactions increases greatly, transaction fees alone are enough to incentivise miners to continue mining.
Note that these outcomes are not mutually exclusive.

Maybe it's true maybe it's not - but one of the genius moves of the current system is that it's almost impossible to do research with 'controlled substances'. So we'll never know.

Bitcoin has a scaling problem. One camp says just stop worrying and increase the block size, the other camp says it will never scale so don't bother.
it seems clear that bitcoin could (from a technical perspective) scale more than it is currently. Conversely off chain scaling would be required for many future problems. As far as I'm aware there's no viable off chain solutions currently (even if segwit was enabled) but I've not checked for a while. Is lightning network ready for use?
Still I fail to see why we can't have both more on chain scaling and off chain solutions? The current deadlock is mostly political not technical.

You'd like to think so, but alas commodities are not that simple. For real world commodities when and where you need then matters a lot (have a copper smelter in the US?

You'd think that Bitcoins would be simpler but alas no. Storing Bitcoins safely isn't easy.
Finally you have the speculative element. Most people who buy gold / bitcoin don't expect to use it, they just hope someone else will want it more in future. This is very difficult to price.

There's no 'right' answer to this question, you have to think through the risks. In both cases the biggest risks are:
* Weak passwords - if your password is weak you are vulnerable whatever happens.
* Malware on your PC that records keystrokes could steal your passwords.
These are pretty much the same for both. After that it's a straight-up tradeoff: 
With electrum if your PC's hard drive fails you lose your wallet (you did remember to backup right? What if your house burns down?). I guess blockchain may go offline but the chances are they are better at looking after data than you are.
With blockchain there's a risk that blockchain's javascript is compromised. If you downloaded bad javascript and logged in then it could steal your coins. Hopefully the community would warn people if this were happening. Equivalently it's possible that an elecrtum binrary is compromised but since you upgrade your software much less often this is a much smaller risk.

That's the problem. You face the complexity of monitoring the vulgar conclusions, plus the logistical difficulty of implementing it in the first place. It's just not a workable idea.
The final kicker is that money is fungible anyway. Let's say you'll never have kids so you don't want to pay for schools. And the government says "fine - we'll make sure your money goes on policing, and find someone else to pay for schools". What does this mean? Well assuming the net income to all departments is the same anyway - it means absolutely nothing. Rather than painstakingly allocating funds, it's much easier to simply ask people how the sum of tax should be apportioned, and divvy up accordingly.

Your view is a bit too simplistic...


True, you don't have to trust a bank with your fiat either. People generally prefer to keep their money in a bank not under the matress though. Mostly because its safer, but also because it provides an investment return. This is still the case for bitcoin. People may choose to keep their coins in a bank rather than manage key storage themselves.


True, but notes provide another purpose: It's a way of trading risk for investment. If I buy Walmart bonds (aka notes / credit) it's not because I don't want to hold US $, it's because Walmart will (hopefully) pay me ~3% a year more than the US government.


MtGox trades aren't on the blockchain. They only appear on the blockchain when / if you choose to cash in and out. It's impossible to correlate people cashing in and out of MtGox to people sending individual orders onto MtGox. MtGox knows all the information and so could be regulated, but that's not a property of bitcoin.

This is of course the default option - but it's a somewhat defeatist approach.

I doubt society at large would want to go back to a cash-like world.

Time to zap some FUD I feel...
Contrary to beliefs held by some here, banks are not running some secret cartel with the main aim of protecting their business. At heart they are like any other private company - basically out there to make money. This means that if / when bitcoin starts to take over parts of the fiat economy you can bet your Goldman Sachs shares that they will be first in line for a slice of the pie!
So why isn't this happening yet? Well this assertion is wrong on two fronts:


Firstly it's far from clear if bitcoin will eventually 'take over' anything. Sure it has potential, but then so does paypal. Economically it has a long way to go still.
Secondly if bitcoin were to take over, banks would still be needed. Banks provide a secure way of holding assets, they provide liquidity, credit, and financial derivative products for managing risk. All of these will still be necessary in a bitcoin economy.

If you want to transfer that much then I suggest starting with 1k but say in your reply you might be looking for more / regular trades.
Also you might find someone who is willing to travel to you for a transaction that large. All I can say is chat to the sellers and see what they say.

You do need to take Matt Taibbi with a pinch of salt.
For example this:


This massive number is a quirk of how interest rate swaps are measured. If I take out a swap on 10 million, I'm basically trading the interest on a loan that size (so about 3% of 10 million = 300 000), however this is measured as "10 million" henece whenever you talk about the swap market you get rediculous numbers that aren't very meaningful.
Once you understand this you can see why you might put in a cheap "6 million" trade for some sushi. They probably knocked a basis point (=0.01%) off the rate, so the customer saved 0.01% * 6 million = 600. A decent discount for a regular customer but hardly a market-moving distortion!
Matt Taibbi's 'thing' is to write outlandish articles about how fat the bankers are and how corrupt the system is to an audience that doesn't understand how the system works. I'm not trying to justify the LIBOR scandal or anything like that, but please be aware that this article is brimming with hyperbole.

It's hard to quantify intrinsic value accurately for sure. Ultimately it's subjective. This guy sees more intrinsic value in gold than I ever would!: 
Even so, it's quite easy to say things like: oil has more intrinsic value than gold, which has more intrinsic value than bitcoin.
Don't get bogged down in trying to resolve all this, since it's largely irrelevant. However historically assets with intrinsic value have always been attractive as forms of money. It's easy to see why: the intrinsic value means that even if you're suspicous of the money, you'll still be able to find a use for it.

Since it's impossible to prevent manipulation (and anyway there's no regulation) you must rationally assume that manipulation is taking place. Though it's hard to state definitively as to what extent things are being manipulated.

I'm sorry but I struggle to buy the 'major car innovation is stifled by regulation' argument. There's plenty of places in the world where cars are either unregulated or the regulation is unenforced. Take the Tata Nano  - it's not street legal in the west as it's not very safe, but nobody cares in India. It's incredibly innovative by automobile standards - yet the result is the same it's still basically still a car. 
And it doesn't really matter if it's a subsidy or taxes or slave labour, the point is it's centrally planned rather than market planned. Let's stick to the key points - especially when we're agreeing! ;)

Not really.
Let's say I'm selling a house that I own outright. Obviously I'm going to demand "real dollars" for this house and nothing else.
You want to buy my house so you enter into a mortgage agreement with your bank. What does your bank have to give me? "Real dollars" of course - the only thing I'll accept.
The imaginary money comes in to the picture when your bank is looking for investments. It can take your mortgage obligation (along with many others) as assets, and it can use these to sell IOUs to the market. It will sell more IOUs than it has in assets, (and it might swap them for other peoples' IOUs), but nobody will confuse these IOUs with real dollars.

This is a false assumption. Most double spend attacks are hard to perform in practice. Lots of the theoretical attacks are compuationally expensive and so only worth doing for large transaction. 0 confirmations is pretty safe for small transactions, and 1 confirmation is fine for anything under $2000 or so.

This is a common misconseption. Banks can't issue new dollars. When they give you a loan you get real treasury dollars (assuming you withdraw it). Banks get those dollars in part from other depositors and in part by selling 'IOU dollars' (commercial paper) to investors. Nobody would mistake this commercial paper for real treasury dollars, so when investors buy the commercial paper they expect a risk premium for it.
So to clarify: The money you the bank lends to you = real treasury dollars. The money the bank 'created' = IOU dollars = commercial paper. 
This story works just as well in bitcoins.

You could download them from Mega (say) but what if someone had hacked the list? The only 100% safe way is to download the entire chain and prune it yourself. Hence there needs to be a way to distribute the entire chain. This is what the satoshi client does.

Use  - it's one of the safest ways of trading small amounts.
You arrange to meet the seller at some convinient point. The seller releases the coins, and gets a code, you verify the code is the same as the one localbitcoins gave you.  You give the seller cash.
Or if you have a smart phone you can just have the seller send the coins directly to a wallet on your phone / laptop. This works better and doesn't need any third parties, but it relies on good mobile connectivity and that both parties know roughly what they are doing.
If you are worried pick a seller with a good reputation (not necessarily the cheapest offer) and let them know in your correspondance that you are new to bitcoins.

Yup you got it. There's no technical reason why the bitcoin economy couldn't fork, leaving two competing but incompatible blockchains. Interestingly in this scenario you'd be able to spend your coins twice, once on each chain!
In practice this seems unlikely at least in the next few years since the stakes would be high. Chances are whichever side satoshidice / MtGox / SilkRoad went for would be pretty quickly declared the victor and the other fork would quickly become worthless.
In the very long term who knows? After all there's plenty of room for multiple fiat currencies and nobody thinks that's particularly bizzare. I suspect if this were to happen it would be more of an evoloutionary change than a revolution.

If this works it would sign anything right? So if a malicious app wants it (or if your yubikey is physically stolen) you lose your money.
Since you have to trust the app anyway, more useful might be to store half a shared secret on it, so that you need phone + yubikey to do any transaction.

I think this is the answer. Unfortunately with the walled-garden systems you really need to play with the operators if you want to get large numbers of customers. Most people looking for kindle books go to Amazon, and if you can't offer bitcoins there you're SOL. Same story if you're an android / iphone app developer.
On the plus side, they amazon store shoppers were unlikely to pay with bitcoin anyway. You can still offer your wares for bitcoin from your own website, and perhaps sneak and also-pay-with-bitcoin message on your product page on the amazon store.

Alas there are restrictions on what a valid bitcoin key looks like, plus the wallet encryption standard protocol has checksums in so it knows if you've supplied a correct password or not.
Of course it would be possible to change the standards to include other alternative encryption protocols. However the net result is something brain-wallet-like where any password will decrypt to a valid key. In which case you may as well use brainwallet.

Bitcointip is basically an address book coupled with a simple bitcoin transfer mechanism. The bot holds an addresses for every redittor (and if they don't have an address it will make one) so you can tip over reddit via username alone.

Moving assets around to globe to avoid tax = tax avoidance. Tax avoidance is nothing new, and is legal (to an extent).

It's a measure of the amount of randomness in a system.
Here's another way of thinking about it: Let's say I pick a number between 1 and 4 (2 bits of entropy). Not very random right? So let's say I generate 4 random numbers and use the following table:
* 1 -&gt; 6395
* 2 -&gt; 4260
* 3 -&gt; 6529 
* 4 -&gt; 8190 
Have I made things more 'random'? Well as soon as you have the table you can see there are still only 4 possibilities. So your system still only has 2 bits of entropy.
This is exactly what you are suggesting, just on a grander scale. Once someone knows your method then you can say for certain there is no extra entropy in the system.

The problem is that there is a cost for storing these tiny balances. Each tiny balance must be stored by each node in the bitcoin network. Although each copy is small, if you multiply though by the number of addresses with tiny balances and the number of nodes in the network you soon end up with a real cost that must be paid by all bitcoiners.
It seems fair that we should do something to reduce this cost that we all have to pay.

Any passphrase you generate in your head is not secure. It is that simple. The only safe way to generate a passphrase is to use some other source of randomness (I.e get your computer to generate it for you)
The rest of the steps are good though. For (b) this really isn't necessary and you'd probably screw it up anyway, don't bother. For (c) you can do this but it's slightly technical, personally I wouldn't worry about it.

Sure. There are some, and they work well. So the question is why does this work between state highways in Australia, yet nobody is doing this in downtown NY or LA where the congestion is?
I'm guessing the real-estate costs are key. If the cost is high then no private company can afford to do it (requiring a Keynesian centralized investment?) or worse: congestion is actually the most efficient solution! To remove congestion would take up real-estate, that land could earn you more money with a factory on it (say) than a road!

Congratualtions you're logged in! 
To log in with your 'real' bitcoin address (whatever that means) you'll need to sign using the private key for that address. You could paste this into brainwallet.org, but there are security risks with that. Better is to get whichever client you normally use to sign the message.

Part of the problem is that people aren't too sure what the weaknesses with bitcoin are. Obviously price instability is a big issue but it's hard to see what can be done about that. There's many questions about scalability both on a technical and an economic level, but it's mostly speculation.

Not sure I follow this? When isn't liquidity needed? What is the metric for 'need' anyway? Why would liquidity dry up except when trading ceases (which is what you are arguing for!).
Anyhow your arguments seem very unscientific. If you'd like a scientific answer have a look at bitcoin prices in the US vs the UK. The US has liquid exchanges (mtgox, coinbase) which means spreads are tight, the UK does not so the best prices are found on the OTC market (localbitcoins) and spreads are wide. Which is better for bitcoin do you think?

The problem is due to psuedoanonymaty anyone can claim any address is or isn't theirs and it's hard to prove either way. Actually you can prove an address *is* yours but only if you choose to do so. This isn't any different from today's banks who don't want to show what assets and liabilities they hold.
Of course any bitcoin owner is free to choose to bank only with institutions that prove they own bitcoin reserve addresses. But you can't prove how many bitcoins they've already lent out to other people so it doesn't help that much.

I suggest you import the wallet you're unloading into your online wallet. Then move all the coins you don't need into a new cold storage wallet. This is much simpler than trying to sign transactions offline so there's less danger of making mistakes.
If you're using paper then this is just a case of scanning in the private QR code. If you're using a wallet.dat then copy the single private key onto a USB stick (or use a QR code, or type the damn thing out, whatever makes you happy). The important thing is that once that wallet has been moved online it's tainted and shouldn't be used again.

Yes - at least in principle. 51% of the miners could decide to ignore any transactions from address X and not accept blocks containing those transactions. Any miners not participating might mine blocks with transactions from address X creating a soft fork, but if most of the power was behind the rules excluding these transactions then the soft fork would soon be overtaken by an alternative chain without the tainted transactions. Because of this all miners would soon 'agree' to go with the blacklist rules otherwise their mining efforts would be orphaned.
This is a point that deserves more discussion. It's hard to imagine how miners would agree on such a blacklist system but equally it could bring legitimacy to the system - and hence wealth, potentially rather a lot of it. Money talks...

And I'm not going to quibble over whether there have been more Keynsians or Austrians in the last century. I would posit that Keynsian thinking has been the mainstream school of thought. However I don't have a source either way [do you?]. Even if this isn't true, there are still significant numbers of them.

Yeah I confused myself a bit here. For one confirm he'll still get the reward because the attack works iff his block wins.
For multiple confirms he starts to forefit rewards since if he descovers a chain length 1 he can't get the reward for that unless he also discovers a chain length two.

You're trolling right? This applies to pretty much any investment.
Nobody knows what bitcoin will do, anyone who claims they do is lying. It is a risky investment that has a lot of potential, but may turn out to be worthless.
The usual golden rule of gambling (investing) applies: Never gamble more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-06-05 09:47:08


This is FUD. If you inadvertantly pay the wrong amount then usually you pay the difference, in severe cases you pay a fine as well. The details vary depending on where you live but generally you have to be willfully avoiding significant amounts of tax to go to jail.


Let's see:
* *Bitcoin mining*: I apply electricity to computer hardware and generate bitcoins which I sell for money.
* *Real mininig*: I apply fuel to diggers and generate copper ore which I sell for money.
* *Farming*: I apply fertilizer to land and generate corn which I sell for money.
* *Music producing*: I apply electicity to computer hardware to generate interesting music which I sell for money.
* *Car manufacturing*: I apply steel and electricy to a manifacturing plant to generates cars that I sell for money.
Need me to go on? :)


If you're concerned any accountant will be able to advise you on how to write good audits to keep the taxman satisfied, it's not a new problem. And unlike most commodities, bitcoin leaves a great paper trail.
The tax system does not need to issue new guidance whenever a new business model appears - think about the consequences if this were really the case! I'm not saying that tax is a simple thing, but the principles are quite simple, and the professionals have been dealing with these types of problem for centuries. 
@_date: 2013-02-13 16:51:53
In order of significance in my opinion:
**Supply side:**
* New bitcoins are being mined continuously [(for now)](
* Sellers on grey markets (e.g. silk road, US gambling sites)
* Early investors / people hoarding coins might want to sell to take profit.
* Merchants using systems like [bitpay]( Not very significant right now but potentially a big driver in the medium term.
**Demand side:**
* Investors / speculators hoping the price will go up.
* Buyers on grey markets, particularly the Silk Road and Gambling sites in the US.
* People looking for ways to store / hide assets in the medium / long term.
* Other buyers for ad-hoc transactions. Probably not significant right now.
Obviously if demand outstrips supply the price goes up and vice versa!

I think someone ages ago was taking about a mmorpg that did this. The problem is it doesn't work. In a nutshell players like to receive money for doing stuff in game. In a traditional mmorpg this is ok as the developers can mint money and give it to players. They can't do this with bitcoin, so the funds must come from elsewhere. Mmorpgs have two funding models: monthly subscription and micro-transactions. You end up with a game that's either pay-to-win, or an elaborate system where hardcore players earn bitcoin off newbies. Neither of which are very enjoyable to play.

I'd go with tumbling. It's not laundering since if you walk into a bank with 1 million of perfectly tumbled bitcoins they are bound to ask some awkward questions just like if you walked in with 1 million of used banknotes.
I'm not aware of any analysis on the topic. One caveat with any 3rd party tumbler is that you're only as secure as the site is. Though in this day and age the Silk Road is one of the few web sites that probably isn't compromised by the US government.
Also note there are two flavors of anonymity, first there's the complete anonymity where you cannot relate two transactions, but there's also plausible deniability, where you put enough intermediaries between the transactions that you can claim any of the intermediaries wasn't you.
What level of tumbling and anonymity you need depends very much on what its for.

The main arguments against segwit are that it's not really a scaling solution (2mb effective block size isn't enough), and so it's unnecessarily complicated / a side show for the real scaling issue bitcoin faces.
On top of that there's this hard fork Vs soft fork debate. Soft forks aren't completely safe since they leave upgraded users hanging, equality​ hard forks aren't always dangerous - the market will pretty quickly determine the winner.
Finally there's the problem that the two camps aren't amicably talking or willing to compromise. As such you need to look here for the pro segwit points and at for the pro bitcoin unlimited points. It's pretty tedious!
Personally I recon it will be stalemate until bitcoin market price crashes, since until then nobody has much incentive to care about the best solution. Who knows if this will be in 2 weeks or 2 years though.

If Bitcoins are like Euros then that's hardly anything new. Plenty of US businesses earn and hold Euros but pay taxes in dollars, so bitcoin would follow the same rules. 
Your payout argument makes no sense either. Clearly it's nonsense to log every payout, just like a business selling retail items to europe would not log every euro payment received. Typically you mark your net position to the current excahnge rate once a month or whatever the tax system requires.
My point remains though, there's nothing new.

Too often I see questions like "why would anyone mine after all the bitcoins have been found", which is not an unreasonable question giving the flawed "mining" analogy.

You don't have to tie an asset to coloured coins. You could colour coin already owned by someone else. These are perfectly possible / unpreventable outcomes of the coloured coin project.

Legally if they are entitled to sieze your assets then they can take your bitcoins.
In practice they might struggle as a) how would they know you own them? b) how would they get the private keys?. Note that in some juristictions / some situations not revealing your private keys is a crime.
Also there's a pragmatic angle. I doubt many debt collectors think to look for bitcoins right now. Though in future this could change.

Another way of looking at this is that many parties will insist on customer verification for KYC / AML regulations. If your bitcoin address is already validated then you can instantly trade with them without having to submit paperwork.

It doesn't matter what the ratios are. The question is how much harder is it for a minor to include your transaction into a block vs just leaving it out?
Due to the way the protocol works it's actually very little effort to include transactions in a block. So little infact that the 3 cents you pay easily covers it. Hence why miners bother to include your transaction even though the fee is pitance.

You now have to pay $500000 to buy back 10 mBTC leaving you seriously out of pocket.

Right, those ASICs cost electricity to run. If the profits from mining don't cover the costs of electricity they will be swithced off. It is that simple.
We know that the block reward will go down. We need bitcoin prices to rise, or transaction fees to rise to compensate. However neither of these are guranteed. If we end up in the situation where ASICs get switched off, then that hardware could easily be put to use to perform double spends.

Instawallet had an extremely poor security model. If you know the URL you could access all the funds. The blockchain.info equivalient is the accountID. Actually it's worse since chrome / gmail / etc have a habbit of capturing URLs and sending them back to base for indexing. 
Once someone hacked instawallet and got a list of URLs (account IDs) then they could access all the funds. With blockchain.info you need the passwords as well, and blockchain do not store the passwords themselves, so there's no risk that they can be stolen.
However: If you have a weak password and blockchain.info gets hacked, then the hacker could in principle brute-force your password and steal your money. **You must use a strong password** to prevent this. I also strongly recommend everyone using blockchain.info to **enable two-factor authentication** as this helps guard against keyloggers / viruses on your computer.

By transaction we mean sending coins from one account to another account.
Bitcoin accounts have two parts - the bitcoin address which everybody knows, and a secret key which only the account holder knows. Let's say Alice has one bitcoin in her account. Alice can create a transaction using her secret key that tells everyone "please pay one bitcoin from Alice's address to Bob's address". Importantly only the person with the secret key (Alice) can create transactions that send coins from Alice's address. She tells everyone this transaction and everyone agrees that Bob now has the bitcoin.
The problem is that Alice could create another transaction "please pay one bitcoin from Alice's address to Eve's address". So how can we make sure that only one person gets the bitcoin? The answer is that Alice sends her transaction to a bunch of computers called miners. The miners check that the transaction is good (so if Alice tried to spend her bitcoin twice they would reject one of the transactions). The miners then publish this transaction (along with many others from other people) into something called a block. Only transactions that have been put into blocks are good transactions. Anyone can look at these blocks and see which transactions are good, and this way anyone can check who currently has the bitcoins.
The details of making a block (aka mining) are complicated. However the important point is that it's difficult to do and requires lots of computers. Alice could become a miner, and try and make a block that sent her coin to Eve not Bob, but it would be very difficult and she'd need a LOT of computers.

Anything where you need a deposit is very hard to manage with bitcoins. For example car hire firms usually take a credit card payment and you're good to go. If you crash the car they can charge the credit card for repairs. This type of transaction is not easily possible with bitcoin.
(Yes you could do it with escrow, but there aren't such services right now, and even if there were, having to provide a huge cash deposit to hire a car is very different to how it works with a credit card)

This is true, but derivatives can also be used to protect against fluctuations in value which is something that bitcoins do suffer from. The other problem with trading the M0 is that you have to have M0 in the first place! Notes and derivatives can be traded on margin (I don't own M0 now but I'll 'lend' it to you for a month, and after that month we'll settle for the difference between the price of M0 now and it's price in a months time).
Case in point - (modern) government bonds have next to no transport costs and negative storage costs (you can rehypothecate them for income) yet there's still a huge bond futures market and a healthy options market.

The number is important, but it's basically the risk free rate for cash (you could argue the us may default, congress seems to have been trying really hard to achieve this recently, but more likely they will print more money).
If this number is high it's not a bad thing per se. It's pretty easy to buy treasury bonds yourself and achieve this return. What it does mean is that things like salary and cost of living, which are typically pegged to outright amounts in dollars, should go down.
It also provides a baseline for bitcoin returns. If Bitcoins gain 5% but treasury bonds in the same period gain 10% then Bitcoins are a poor investment. Right now Bitcoins are so insanely volatile that attempts to measure them on classic investment metrics don't really work very well.

Just a technical point: Sounds like you're worried about not avoiding tax not money laundering. You can pay tax on laundered money, and you can avoid tax on clean money. They are different things.
Do you know where your coins came from? You are money laundering (inadvertently) if those coins came from illegal sources. Hard to prove either way of course, and since it's early days I wouldn't worry about it too much. I would however pay the appropriate capital gains tax.

The terminology is unfortunate. 'miners' are really bitcoin accountants. They validate every bitcoin transaction.

This is theoretically possible, but bloody difficult to do in practice. Let's assume that everyone is willing to tell you what their address is (most people are not - you can't force them). How do you classify 'government' vs 'nongoverment'? Here are some examples:
* Tresuray office = government.
* My personal address = non government.
* Contractor who works for government sometimes = ???
* Publicly funded hospital = ???

The year is 2020, 6 months after the block reward halves for the third time to 6.125 bitcoin experiences its first major heist in the form of a 51% attack. A group of rogue miners, after operating at a loss for many months decide to exit the bitcoin game in style. Their plan is cunning, they place a large number of bets on Satoshidice and work on an alt chain that contains double spends only for the losing bets - this allows the attackers to attempt the double spend many times without anyone noticing.
After trying for 10 hours the attackers finally discover an alt-chain that's two blocks long and release it to the network. Their total haul is 6550 BTC (~$2million) from satoshi dice, but they are able to capitalise on the resulting bitcoin crash by short-selling on bitcfd.com - the completely unregulated exchange for bitcoin options. Analysts estimates reckon the attackers probably quadrupled their gains this way.

Banking does need a free market for discovering the rate. The problem is that loans are messy. To secure a loan typically a borrower lends government bonds to the lender. If the borrower defaults the lender keeps the bonds.
The problem is that a French bank would (typically) post french bonds, a Greek bank would (typically) post Greek bonds. If I'm a lender then if there's a default I'd rather have the French bonds, so the french bank gets a better rate. But how much better? You can see it's suddenly going to get very complicated!
This complexity is the reason its set by committee. It's not impossible to move to an open exchange, but it is tricky. Hence the current mess.

Governments rarely declare a technology illegal. There are plenty of examples of prior technologies that are nefarous but have not been prohibited (bittorrent, tor, pgp, etc). Given the lack of precedent it's hard to imagine them declaring bitcoin itself illegal. Without any such mandate / declaration, there's no reason for governments / militaries to sabotage bitcoin. 
Underground crime syndicates don't require such mandates, so they whould have done so by now if it were possible. Bitcoin hasn't been sabotaged in this way so it's reasonable to believe that such a sabotage isn't possible, or at least isn't econmic, at the moment.

I tried this out (disclaimer / thanks to CryptoWallets for the free coins to play with!). It seems to work as stated on the tin. I have a few points for feedback though:
* What's the confirmation code for? When I send "B" or "Info" you send the confirmation code. I deliberately didn't use it on my "send" command and it worked anyway. I don't see how it's useful anyhow :)
* Why do you care about any confirmations? All the transactions are done on-chain. The coins used in the "send" are the coins I've deposited to you. So if the deposit fails the send will fail. =&gt; Don't wait for any confirms.
* "Info" and "B" could be merged into one. Something like this: "Balance: 123.4567BTC Deposit: 1BUAvdJtxni3SB822KhoWbBeBwdjjMQHkB Commands: Send &lt;phone  or Send &lt;bitcoin addr&gt;. Fee 0.0007" - 124 chars
* I like the fact that it generates a new address each time, but (small gripe) you shouldn't say "Welcome new user!" if I've used the service before.
* One weakness of this (and reddit's bitcointip for that matter) is that all the transactions are done on-chain. There's not /much/ value in this, since you hold the private keys we have to trust you entirely anyway. It just means more fees / more delays. Have you considered just holding a net balance and only doing an on-chain transaction when people cash out?

Yup. It's not the amount that's dumb, it's the fact that you're *borrowing* money for a high risk investment (aka a gamble). You must understand that bitcoin is a high risk investment right now. It might shoot up, but it might as likely fall in value.


Never gamble more than you can afford to lose. 
I can tell you're bit-keen, so look at it this way: How much money would you be willing to spend on a night out? Maybe $50? So instead of one big lump sum investment, put aside $50 a month to spend on bitcoins. If the price falls, well all you need to do is stay in and watch TV insted of going out for beers once a month to make up for it. It's an amount you can afford to lose.

The problem is that if the seller disputes the transaction and paypal does a chargeback you're screwed. I doubt ebay wants the headache of any sort of fiat transactions like this so I suspect it bans them all.

If you generate a transaction, copy it to the offline computer using a USB stick, sign it, copy it back. Then this is fine. However I was talking about a paper wallet. Currently paper isn't smart enough to sign transactions - and doesn't have a USB port anyway ;).
With the paper wallet you have to upload it to a computer. At this point it's no longer a paper wallet, it's a digital wallet with a paper backup. I guess if the computer you upload it to is an offline computer and you do the USB transfer / sign thing, and you securely delete it afterwards you'll be fine. However the USB transaction thing is tedious to do, and it's easy to forget to clean up after yourself.
Much easier, since paperwallets are cheap, is to upload the wallet to your online computer, spend your bitcoins, then transfer everything to a **new** paper wallet.

Also why take the risk? It's trivial to write a computer program to generate passwords with entropy. It's trivial to use a more secure wallet app. It's trivial to use BIP38 or some other system that computationally expensive as the basis for your password. Any / all of these remove the human-brain-lack-of-entropy risk.

We don't know it's **your** account (unless you tell us), we just know it's **an** account.
Sure you say you can follow the transactions. But try and do this, you'll realise it's hard!
Also a lot of the classic online wallets - easywallet.org, instawallet.org, will send the coins from a different address than they receive them from. As will MtGox and indeed the Silk Road. So you can wash through one of these services and achieve near anonanymity for the cost of an extra standard transaction fee - at the risk that if anyone were able to inspect the transaction logs of the service providers they would know you performed both transactions.
@_date: 2013-04-14 09:51:12
We're getting technical here, but basically there's a peer-to-peer network that relays any valid transaction to everyone else in the network.
The miners collect these transactions together into blocks (and pocket the fees in the process).
A transaction is consider to be confirmed if it has been included in at least one block. The more blocks (=&gt; the more confirmations) the better.
So... Validation takes place at every step. Clients won't relay the transaction across the network unless it is valid, and miners won't include it in a block unless it's valid. However only the miners' validation will lead to a confirmation, and only miners earn the transaction fee. 
Does that help clarify things?

Thanks :p. It doesn't matter (to me - but you brought it up) whether the system is or isn't email. I'm not sure why you're debating this, the same points hold regardless of what the system is.
We agree anonymous users shouldn't have unfettered access to an email proxy. Great.
You propose a sending fee, but I don't see why anyone would choose to pay it. You've not really got to the bottom of that point. But then you say it would be better not to allow sending at all - which is also a fair point. Personally I believe the system would be more use if sending was allowed (with restrictions).
I'm proposing simply that the bitcoin address isn't empty when you send a mail. This provides a barrier of entry that is pretty low but high enough to stop people generating large numbers of accounts. Note that the coins in your address are not a fee, they don't get spent and you still have full control over your bitcoins, hence it's different to your suggestion ;)

The key thing being that bitcoin offers a market for perks.
Buying dinner in a restaurant? Or buying from a big retailer like Amazon? You're probably not going to return it, or if you do you can trust their reputation not to screw you over. You don't need to pay 3%.
Buying from a small-time seller off ebay? 3% is a fair price to pay for piece of mind that if it goes wrong someone else will cover the cost.
Credit cards do nothing for business-to-business transactions, but they still take their 3%. On top of this bitcoin truely global, there are no FX fees, big merchants and small merchants pay the same fees. No wire charges. etc etc. All these other benefits still exist.

Let me clarify - one possible outcome in the future is that the net value of transaction fees does not increase. 
Currently miners earn 25.3*6*24*~$130 ~= $470k per day. Maybe the price of bitcoins will go up. Maybe the transaction fees will go up. However the one thing we do know for certain is that the block reward (the 25) will go down.
If this goes down miners will quit, the difficulty will decrease, and the network will become more vulnerable to 51% attacks. This effect could could start a deadly cycle, that could kill off the network. If you ask me it's one of the more likely things to kill off bitcoin in the medium term. We will only find out in 12 years or so when the block reward becomes much less significant than it is now.

That's not what intrinsic value usually means. Nobody doubts bitcoin has some useful properties, nor does anyone doubt that bitcoins are valuable right now. However intrinsic value refers specifically to the value you can yield from it directly. By that definition bitcoin doesn't have any intrinsic value. There's not much point in pretending otherwise.
It's worth noting that intrinsic value is not a very well defined concept, you could for instance argue that the intrinsic value of a piece of paper with a number printed on it is also very little, but most economists accept that since you can pay taxes with those pieces of paper it counts as part of the intrinsic value.

Seems a bold move but let's give the OP the benefit of the doubt! I suspect there's waaay more to opening a casino than how you cash-in / cash-out, and I doub't anyone here knows much about the topic. But lets solve the cash problem at least:
I guess you could run electronic games directly off the blockchain (bitcoin slots etc) but it would be a lot of work and risk creating satoshi-dice like spam. Also I can't why customers would do this rather than play satoshidice or any other bitgame there is online.
So I assume generally you'll be using casino chips. In which case the mechanism is simply this:
* 1. Customer pays bitcoins to your address
* 2. Check for the transaction (don't worry about confirms for deposits &lt; $10k).
* 3. Give out chips
And the same in reverse, they give you chips and a bitcoin address and you return them bitcoins. I imagine people will be using wallets on mobile phones so you need to be able to display and read QR codes to fascilitate this.

People don't /really/ get to decide whether to pay tax, it's just a new way of hiding money from tax inspection - However you still owe the tax and you can still be jailed (etc) if you get caught.
The reality of tax collection is that small operators can and do get away with tax evasion all the time because up to a point it's not worth the costs to enforce tax rules. That's the category most of us are in right now.  However in future if you are ever paid by a large company in bitcoin it will still be perfectly visible to the tax inspector - if anything it will be *more* visible than it is right now due to the public nature of the blockchain.

Sure, banks come with risks. Actually the bigger risk is that the bank goes bust. Ultimately you don't *have* to use a bank to hold your fiat money. Most people assume that the risk of the bank going bust / the state taking their money is less than the risk of it being stolen, and thus freely choose to use the bank's services.
This seems just as reasonable a decision (and tradeoff) in the bitcoin world as it is in the fiat world.

It's worth noting that the last block issuance isn't very significant economocially speaking. What is more interesting are the next few halving events. Going from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC is much more significant than going from ~0.01 BTC to 0 (or whatever the last jump is).

It doesn't seem like DPR had the forthought to plan for this contingency. We don't even know if he has a copy of his private keys - if he doesn't then it's game over. Even if he does he will probably have to trust one individual with the information. Time will tell.
As a problem it's much more interesting. If DPR can perform a hash function in prison then he's fine like you say. I'm sure devising a simple hash that can be done with pen and paper isn't too tough. The bigger problem is that the hash result would need to be written down, so is vulnerable to being intercepted. The courier could remember the first few digits but it's still a risk.
Much better would be to use a dictionary. Continuing your idea, let's say you took the first 1000 words from Romeo and Juliet (there will be some duplicates, oh well). Now you just need to generate a predictable sequence of numbers between 1-1000, and map them to the words. Take 10 words from this sequence and that's your brain wallet.
So that just leaves the sequence generator problem. Something like this might do the trick:  For small M you could do it easily enough with a scientific calculator. It wouldn't be terribly secure on its own but as long as you concealed the method it should be alright.

The real win of a bitcoin bank is that it would store coins safely for you - just like a conventional bank stores cash safely for you. If a trustworthy institution were to offer bitcoin banking services it would be a great boon to the community. The problem is that all bitcoin service providers are very young, so it's extreemely difficult to establish the required trust.
However the bottom line is I trust my regular bank with far more cash than the value of the bitcoins I hold. I would love them to look after my bitcoins too so that I don't have to worry about security.

Right. But regardless of how you power it, the car will be roughly the same (I'm defining 'car' to be something than uses a road). Most of the world has no rules about how you make a car, yet the result is always similar. This is fairly good evidence to suggest that the current design cars is pretty efficient.
However your point is that roads are subsidised, and without this subsidy we'd have less roads and so perhaps we'd have more railways or canals. This might lead to better train / hovercraft designs. That's a fair point. 
But the designs for cars (i.e. things that use roads) would probably be the same as it is right now.

As a general tip for newbies, you can guess the answer to many simple bitcoin questions by substituting "bitcoin" for "cash" - let's try it:


Usually you earn it - provide goods or services for someone and have them pay you. You can buy it with other cash, e.g. pay Euros, buy Bitcoins. Checkout  and the like.


Well in principal do whatever you usually do to get paid. In practice bitcoin's virtual nature lends itself to digital services, so if you can offer your services digitally it should be easy ( For the rest of us we just earn fiat currency doing what we're good at and buy bitcoins online with it.

The attack in the thread is a form of double spend where you have a complex chain of transactions race with a conflicting single transaction. This particular case can easily be mitigated by checking the inputs to your transaction aleady have confirmations.
However you'd still be exposed to the 'classic' double spend where the attacker releases a conflicting transaction with a higher fee. You can mitigate this using well connected nodes to listen for the transaction and whatnot but there will always be some risk. Finally you're at risk of Finney attacks but these are expensive to pull off and require very tight timing from the attacker.


Pointless. The attacker could perform a bunch of bona-fide transactions between his addresses before performing an attack.


It depends on your business model. If you have to ship a physical product or service the accept the order with 0 confirms, but don't ship until you have 3, job done. If your digital service is reversible then accept with 0 confirms but switch off the service if there's a problem. If you're talking about sales where the buyer is physically present then the risk is massively reduced but you could install CCTV / ask for ID if you're paranoid. If you're offering digital downloads then you should probably take the losses on the chin, chances are the attackers would have simply pirated the data anyway. You get the idea, think it through and work out something that's good for your business.
Indicentally although it's wise to be prudent about double spends. They are tricky to pull off and so quite rare in practice. Please report back if you ever see one!

Nobody likes paying taxes, but society on aggregate feels the benefits outweigh the disadvantages [evidently, otherwise we'd vote in zero-tax politicians, which we never do in the west].
Unfortunately due to human nature as individuals we often like to avoid paying taxes. Some people will justify it with a political argument, some won't even bother to do that.
So why bitcoin? Well some here feel that bitcoin provides an easy vector to avoid paying taxes.
There are two big fallacies with this though:
* 1. You can't use politics to justify your personal tax evasion. If you think a tax is immoral that's fine, vote accordingly, get the majority of society to agree with you, and the tax will be removed. You can't morally avoid tax on a unilateral basis.
* 2. Bitcoin has an eternal public record of every transaction ever made. It's not a great platform for tax avoidance. The only reason why it works right now is because it's new and poorly understood by tax collectors.

What do you mean by "know" your private key? It's a random string of 64 characters. Whilst you /could/ commit it to memory I doubt anyone does. People just know where to find it - on their harddrive, on a piece of paper, or occasionally encrypted with a brainwallet passphrase. In your case it's on your harddrive.
There is an alternative where you don't know where to find your private key. For example if you have any BTC held by MtGox they won't give you the key to it, but if you know your login details they will transfer it on your behalf. The advantage of this is that it can't be lost or stolen (or rather, it's not your fault if it does happen) but the disadvantage is that you have to trust the company that's looking after your bitcoins to do their job. It's the same as choosing to store cash in your mattress or cash in your bank.

A wallet is just a private key and an address (aka public key). This could be in a file on your computer, or printed on a piece of paper.
When you send money the bitcoin network will verify that you have the coins to send in the first place by looking at the previous transactions. When you run the client you are participating in this network, but you don't have to participate yourself to send money (though you need to know someone who does, which is how the online wallets work). The miners will accept your transaction making it part of the blockchain (transaction log). You don't need to do anything special to accept the bitcoins.

You can't just steal bank credentials. Cash machines have a $500 or so limit on them. Everything else requires you to walk into a bank (they have CCTV) or leave an electronic trail. The moment you're freed you can change the credentials / stop the accounts, and often reverse the transactions.
I'm not saying it's impossible, just FAR more risky for the attacker than with a paper / brain wallet.

Actually, since it doesn't suffer from inflation, bitcoin is a great tool to make sure the rich remain rich forever.

Not really. Just broadly similar.

True, but it kinda goes with anonymity. Specifically if both parties want  to maintain anonymity then the transaction must be hidden from the authorities by definition. 
However you're right, it's probably best avoided for an introductory debate. I usually point out that it's no worse than cash. Possibly even less anonymous in the case where only one party is hoping for anonymity.

Coloured coins are pretty much only at the concept stage so right now you need not worry about them. If you want to wildly speculate then, assuming the idea catches on, it will go one of two ways:
Coloured coins are used by private issuers to issue special assets. Since the value of the bitcoin underlying this asset really is a token amount, the bitcoin volume of these assets will be negligible - far far less than the volume of bitcoin that is lost each year.
Somebody will devise a bitcoin v2 concept that uses colored coins to 'bootstrap' off the existing bitcoins. Mastercoin is trying to do this for example [caveat: So far also extremely experimental, I'm not endorsing their product]. Should this bitcoin v2 catch on it's conceivable that a significant amount of bitcoins will be moved over. However this won't contribute to deflation since effectively people are expressing their faith in bitcoinV2 over bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:40:32
Typically you only pay tax on the profit when you sell the coins for EUR. (not claiming to be an expert though!). So if you only liquidate a few coins each year it might not make a dent in your situation.

You raise an interesting question. There are two solutions:
**A wallet that only alows a max withdraw per day**
If you're willing to trust a third party then you could use a 2-of-2 signing system, where any of your transactions must be signed by the third party who will always sign for the first 5 bitcoins per day and no more. Obviously if they decide do sign more, or (worse) refuse to sign anything you're screwed. If you wanted something trustless then you might be able to do it with [nLockTime]( but this is not yet implemented in the bitcoin protocol so you're out of luck.
**A wallet constructed in such as way that you could plausibly deny you had the full amount in there**
What you need is an encrypted key that decrypts into two valid private keys when given a different password. This is not too dissimilar to having two brainwallets. If someone threatens you, you reveal the one with a few token coins, and keep the other secret. This is doable, though rather ticky to construct and get right. I don't know of any software that extends this idea into a fully featured wallet.

The deflationary properties and lack of central back are interesting, and attract certain idealists to bitcoin.

Maybe in the future bitcoins will be used more widely and so these markets won't matter as much, but right now they do.

Hmm. I reckon a smart hacker with a few GPUs can get through ~1000 million passphrases a second. So let's do the maths:
5 word pass phrase = 30 bits of entropy
Add / change a random couple of characters = 10 bits of entropy
Permutations = 10 bits of entropy.
Total value = 50 bits
2^50 = 1.1e16
Guesses per day ( guesses per second) ~= 1.5e12
Days to search everything = 7500 ~= 20 years
Mining income from 1 gigahash per second = 44 cents per day ~= $3200 in 20 years.
So you just need to find one bitcoin wallet with more than $3200 (5 coins) and you're quids in.
**TL;DR** Hackers get more money off brainwallets than mining.

Glad you appriciate the feedback - look forward to version 1.1


I see - is spoofing really practical? Still it's a pain in the ass to include it, perhaps you could ask for a challenge response? Something like this:
* I SMS "send +44 7123 456789"
* You reply "really send 0.45 BTC to +44 7123 456789? To complete this transaction please reply with 'ZYX123'"
* I reply ZYX123 to approve the transaction.
The good thing about this is I can choose to include a confirmation code or just fall back to the challenge response, depending on how familiar I am with the system. You could also consider not bothering with the challenge for tiny transactions etc etc.

Well first off mining is a collective game, so they can't mine *all* the bitcoins, only a share.
Secondly, so what if they do? Anyone can mine if they want to, even north korea, al qaeda, the CIA, etc. We couldn't stop them. And it doesn't make much difference to bitcoin who does the mining, as long as it's not a single agent.
There's one key economic reason why they don't do this: It doesn't make all that much money!! IBM / Google / China can make more money doing what they do best than moving into a new business that isn't actually very profitable.
That just leaves the nefarous agents. Perhaps NSA / China would like to subvert bitcoin? Well since they are not doing this you can conclude that either a) they don't wish to subvert bitcoin, or b) it's not worth their resoruces to do so.

Here are the rules in TL;DR format:
* Bitcoin 'mining' is what makes the whole system work - it keeps track of who has the bitcoins.
* Mining is expensive (costs hardware and electricity). Miners get compensated in two ways: Block reward (which decreases over time), and transaction fees.
* Miners don't have to accept any transactions, but if they do they keep the transaction fee. Therefore the bigger the fee you pay, the more likely your transaction is to be accepted.
Generally if you pay the recommended fee your transaction will be accepted quickly. If you don't it might be accepted eventually but could take a long time.

This is a very good question.
Currently you have to create a unique address for each payment, then look at the blockchain for mayments to those addresses. This is alright for most purposes but has a few floors:
* Transactions can take a few seconds to propagate through the blockchain. This is a bit slow.
* You can't prove that the payment was really sent from the customer. Someone else could have sent it.
* You can't prove to third parties that a payment took place for a specific transaction (i.e. you can't get a recipt of payment).
* The whole transaction is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker manipulates the address the client sees for the merchant.
Fortunately this is an area the bitcoin team are working on right now. [BIP 0070]( describes an extension to the bitcoin protocol that a) passes the transaction directly from client to merchant, and b) provides a cryptographic recipt for both parties.

Right, but the bitcoin equivalent of losing your money is losing your encryption keys / having your computer infected by a keylogger / etc. These ecnrypted services can't protect against that, but a bank could. In exchange the bank could access your funds, so it's up to you if you like the trade off. I suspect in the long term many people will prefer a bank in the same way they prefer not to store cash in their mattress. But of course it's up to you!


* This isn't necessarily true. Just bring up a chart of gold vs $, you'll see it has multi-year down trends as well as up trends. 
* Regardless of whether this is true or not, you can *always* expect a better return lending out your assert than you can just sitting on it. This is exactly how investment banks make their money!


I'm not going to get into a discussion on why taxes are / aren't a good idea. The fact is they have been part of civilised society for 2000+ years and they aren't going away. Bitcoin provides some intereting short term opportunities for breaking the law, but since most taxes come from payroll, sales, and stamp duty - all of with are relatively easily to audit without looking at your bank account - it doesn't really make a significant difference in tax collection.

It's a tough call. Clearly there's demand for online advice, so you can expect an anonymous bitcoin powered service to fill the gap since they cost nothing to operate. They could probably prove they were qualified doctors relatively easily - or at least try to, so one must assume they are not. However that doesn't mean their advice is no good.
How can you know the advice is any good? Or are they just 21st century witch doctors?  They are asnwering questions publicly so there's an element of peer review. Beyond that it's hard to know. Still other than issuing a caveat emptor, why should this be banned? Plenty of people will solicit advice from all sorts of crazy sources anyway. Is this any worse?

The reasons bankers / hedge funds aren't massively interested in bitcoins are quite simple:
* They are too small. There simply aren't enough of them being traded to make a large profit by banking standards.
* They are too volatile. I doubt any professional will see the current state of bitcoin as anything other than a bubble.
Given enough time you can bet they will be all over bitcoins if / when they catch on. There's nothing you can do to stop it!

A lot of people struggle to comprehend just how large the numbers are. A bitcoin key has 256 bits, which is roughly 10^77. The current global computing power is something like 20000 Terraflops (2*10^16 flops), let's pretend we have a billion times more processing power so 10^28 flops. So dividing through it would take all the computers ~10^49 seconds to count through all the private keys. The age of the universe is 'only' 10^17 seconds. Not even close. Infact so far away that even if we could deadicate another billion universes to the task and still not get to 1% of the keys.
This is *just to count through all the private keys*. i.e. start from one and work our way to 10^77. We're not actually trying to calculate anything.
**TL;DR** You can't brute force this stuff, the numbers are vast.

Right now?
1. Scan QR code on merchant's counter.
2. Enter the amount you wish to pay the merchant.
3. Press ok
4. Merchant waits for conformation that the transaction has been publishd to the network.
If the merchant is high-tech he might have a way of generating QR codes on a screen that contains the correct amount, so all you need do is press ok after scanning (i.e. combine steps 1 and 2).

The standard yubikey works very similar to Google 2fa. In both cases if the device is compromised / stolen (even for a short while) then you are no longer protected. In both cases you need to trust a third party when setting up 2fa. With yubikey you also need the third party to perform a login (at which point if they turn malicious they could potentially hijack your 2fa credentials), but Google have free reign over your phone os, so if they turn malicious you have problems too.
In short they are broadly similar. Both are good for small / medium sized amounts. For large amounts you should be looking at offline storage anyway.

Each address has a public part (the 1abc123... bit) and a private part. The private part stays offline. You give the public part to someone and they 'send' you bitcoins. Or more succinctly they update the global ledger so that there are some bitcoins attached to your public address. Nobody can get at those coins until you put the private part of the key online.
If you want a real analogy it's a bit like opening a bank account in your name. People can put money into that account just fine, but until you turn up to the bank with some proof of ID, you can't take any money out. [kinda, it's tricky to come up with good analogies]

@_date: 2013-10-23 05:19:15
It's slightly complicated since technically the fees depend on the number of bytes in the transaction, which is non trivial to calculate. Also bitcoin is unusual in that generally the customer pays this fee - again mostly for technical reasons, but something that may evolve in future. One odd side effect of this is that if you receive lots of tiny transactions you end up paying more in fees. Without getting too bogged down in the details this becomes a natural anti spam protection, you can't bring the network down by sending billions of 10 cent transactions to yourself because the fees would soon add up. Full discussion of the fees for micro-transactions deserves its own thread.
The amazing thing about bitcoin is that the fee is not related to the size of the transaction. That ~1 cent you pay on your 10 cent transaction is expensive, but for $1 you still pay ~1 cent, or even $10 or $100.  You can see how it quickly becomes insignificant.
Case in point, the Feds recently moved ~2 million of seized coins for ~20 cents. No other payment network is even close to being that efficient!
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:14:43
Might be cleare to refer to the "Target" as the "Difficulty Target"? Just my opinion but lots of people talk about "difficulty" which is the same thing.
Your description of "Nonce" is confusing. The nonce can be abosultely anything such that the hash of the block (which includes the nonce) is less than the difficulty. Miners try to find such a nonce and the only way they can do this is by trying 000s of different nonces until they find one that gives a suitable hash. Crucially they don't need to increment the nonce, they could multiply it by two, or use hashes of their ex-girlfriends names, whatever makes them happy :).
You don't talk about transaction fees. At the very least you should say the block reward consists of a set amount plus all the transaction fees in the block.

Despite the antagonistic tone, it's not a bad article, though obviously it will fail the circle-jerk test. 
Bitcoin is essentially betting on Moores law to apply to bandwith and storage costs to scale, if it doesn't we're left with trusted parties performing off-chain transactions, which is basically what we have in the banking / payment industry today.
Inflation is seen as many as good for the economy in general, and the past ~100 years of economic growth seems to back this up. Central banks generally do a reasonable job of managing inflation, though of course they can't please all the people all the time.
It's also a fair concern that irreversable payments are bad for consumers. Whilst this is inevitable in an anonymous decentralised world, and no-doubt a feature for merchants, it's still something that would need redressing. Consumer protection has been a huge driver for e-commerce.

The problem with a deflationary economy is there is no reason to lend. Why should I lend my coins at risk? If I simply hold my bitcoins then in future they will be worth more anyway. 
A key question is how deflationary is the economy? If it's only deflating a little then some lending should take place. If it's deflating a lot then no lending will take place.
The good thing about an inflationary economy is that buyers and sellers are free to set any borrowing rate they choose such that they feel the risks justify the rewards. There is a market for borrowing and markets are good. Since no rational lender would lend at a loss, in the deflationary environment this market is floored and thus the amount of borrowing is limited.
...That's not to say deflationary environments are better / worse than inflationary ones - but there would certainly be less lending.

Bitcoin is pretty much like that.

There's also some first-mover advantage going on, plus although competing cryptocurrencies make small technical improvements, none of them have clearly demonstrated they are significantly better than bitcoin on a technical level. But who knows, maybe they will?
A government backed electronic currency is unlikely to have the same benefits as a cryptocurrency, particularly when it comes to no chargebacks and anonymity. In principle a government could issue a cryptocurrency, which would be a fascinating experiment, but I don't see it happening any time soon.

@_date: 2013-07-12 17:17:25
Well it depends on the rates doesn't it?
If the expected value of bitcoins next year is 5% higher than today, and a counterparty is willing to pay you 10% more if you convert to fiat and lend to them for a year then there is a clear incentive to lend!
Would you be more competative than a fiat lender? Well its unlikely, but bitcoin has some things going for it - in particular you can lend anonymously and lend globally with ease. Perhaps a borrower would be willing to pay a premium for this? 
Equally there's a reduction argument. Let's say holding bitcoin was *clearly* a better investment than lending fiat at risk, in this situation all rational fiat holders would buy bitcoin, pushing the price up until such a time as other investments become competative again.

The vertical lines in the graph represent 'walls'. These are large orders - if you see a vertical line at $150 then it means lots of people are prepared to sell right now for $150 (or buy, depending on which colour the wall is).
These wall support the price, for if the price is to rise above $150, then all those who want to sell at $150 must have their orders filled first. So the theory goes anyway.
However these walls aren't what they seem! Right now I might see large walls at $160, but people with those orders have every right to move / cancel them. They might think "hmm, the price is going up, I'm not going to sell for $160, I'll try and get a better price" - this is why these large walls appear to vanish very quickly.
**TL;DR** Don't read too much into all this talk about walls.

I like coloured coins and I think they are a great mechanism for issuing bitcoin bonds / shares / debt, that sort of thing.
However I don't see how they could form an exchange. The main problem that excahnges solve is matching buyers and sellers. To do this realtime requires quite a lot of dedicated resources (matching, providing data feeds, etc) so exchanges usually like to take a fee on any matched trades. Your coloured tokens don't allow for exchange fees, so there's no economic reason why an operator would provide a matching service.

Bear in mind that right now bitcoin is inflating by about 10% a year. Even if it were not inflating at all, dollar base rates are only 0.5% right now, so a bitcoin bank is only at a 0.5% dissadvantage vs a dollar bank.
Deflation is an obstacle to lending, I fully agree. But it's not a showstopper.

I agree. People here often overlook the benefits of credit cards. You could never rent a car via bitcoins for example. Credit cards effectively create a chain of trust (you trust the credit card company, the credit card company trusts the merchant). This is a useful service and the 3% credit card fees are a reasonable way to charge for this.
I don't think bitcoin will make credit cards go away - the same system will work with BTC as a currency. What it should do is make fees more transparent. You can choose to trust the merchant firectly and pay only a few pennies of fees, or if you prefer you can go via a credit company and pay a small % fee. The important thing is that the fees are transparrent and you have a free choice.

**What is it doing?**
Mining is a way of generating new blocks. The aim is to pick a random string, called a nonce, to solve this problem:
Hash( previous block header + transactions + nonce ) = 0
Hash() is a simpleish formula that turns a block of text into a summary string. The key thing is that slightly different blocks of text give very different hashes.
The tricky part is figuring out what the nonce is. The only way to do it is to keep on trying different strings until you get one such that the result of the equation is 0. 
Actually it's very hard to get to 0 so we agree that it just needs to be close to 0. *How close exactly?* Well this is what people refer to as 'difficulty' and get's adjusted over time depending on how many people are mining so that this equation is solved globally roughly once every 10 minutes.
**Why do this?**
This is bitcoin's book-keeping. By solving it you:
* accept the previous block as valid
* accept that the transactions are valid
This problem is actually difficult to solve. So once you've generated a block that shows a transaction is valid it would be hard for someone else to generate another block with a transaction that has a conflicting transaction (aka a 'double spend').
This whole process is what keeps track of who has bitcoins, and ensures that bitcoins can only be spent once.

Price volatility is an issue with bitcoins, offering to smooth out volatility spikes for your customers is generous. The problem is that customers can choose BTC or Fiat. 
On weeks when the BTC price is rising, you're generously subsidising BTC customers by offering them lower rates. On the weeks when BTC falls, your BTC price will look expensive and your customers will pay cash.
You could do daily (or even hourly) rates, but the problem is the same just on a smaller scale. This is why coinbase and bitpay always use the spot price.

The maths is fine, but there's a big catch: While the attacker is trying performing his attack he's not contributing to the network. This means he's not going to earn his regular income!
Let's take your example of a guy who has 10% of the network. Instead of attacking you he could be earning 10% of 25 bitcoins every block = 2.5 BTC. If your tansaction is less than this it would be an utter waste of his time for him to attack you. Actually it's worse, his attack only succeeds 1 in 5 times so your tansaction needs to be 2.5 * 5 = 12.5 BTC to be worth the effort.

So first up, if he used a passphrase and you have no clue what it is, chances are you're out of luck. But it's worth investigating:
Two steps:
**Find the wallet.**
Wallets can be stored as a file on your computer. The common bitcoin wallet apps are "BitcoinQt" "Amory" and "Multibit" see if you can find one of those. Also look to see if there is any encryption software on the computer (Truecrypt or similar), he might have stored the coins in an encrypted partition.
If not he might have stored it in an online wallet. Blockchain.info is probably the main one. There are others. Do you have access to his email? Look for emails from these providers. If you're lucky you can find some emails with bitcoin addresses in them, that would allow you to determine how many bitcoins he owned at least.
How did he buy his coins in the first place? Chances are he may have an account with Localbitcoins, MtGox or Bitstamp. He might have left some coins with them. Check browser history / email.
Finally did he use the Silk Road or similar (for buying drugs online)? If he did he might have kept the coins there. Again you'll have your work cutout because you need a username and password just to get in and these sites don't offer any "I forgot my username" type service! 
**Get access to the coins.**
If it's a sofware wallet, fire up the software. There's a chance it wasn't encrypted in which case congratulations you're done.
If he has an account with Localbitcoins, MtGox or Bitstamp then contact them. It will probably be a drawn out process but I guess if you can prove you are the next of kin they will (eventually) give you the coins.
If it's blockchain.info or if its a sofware wallet and encrypted then things get really difficult unless you know the password. At this point you need to find someone who is good a password cracking to help you, and even then you're looking at a virtually impossible task.

It's not really possible, and so far no governments have banned cryptocurrencies. It's highly unlikely that any western government will try either.
The biggest weakpoint is where you change fiat for cryptocurrency. Such transaction systems are generally highly regulated and so the current mechanism isn't to ban them but rather put an arbitrarily expensive barrier to entry such that no legitimate bitcoin company can be started without paying out millions.
This still can't prevent people exchange cash for bitcoin over-the-counter, but such transactions are relatively expensive to execute and so will come at too large a premium to make bitcoin a viable means of exchange - though it is fine for investors.
I'm actually optimistic on this. I think western governments will start to dismantle these barriers to entry, and some players with deep pockets will pay to create legitimate businesses in order to get 1st-mover advantage. It will take time but eventually the playing field will level somewhat.

These IOUs don't look like cash, they are credit notes, corporate bonds, etc. If people choose to value them like cash that's up to them. When you transfer between two bank accounts it's entirely up to the receiving institution to decide if it will take an IOU or demand real dollars.
The same would work just fine in the bitcoin world. A bitcoin bank could issue IOUs redeemable for bitcoins. It's entirely up to the market to decide if these IOUs are worth anything.
You might think its foolish to accept bitcoin IOUs, but that's for the market to decide. If the choice is between 1 BTC or 1 BTC IOU from MtGox there's no contest, but if the choice is 1 BTC or 1.2 BTC IOU from MtGox many people might go for the IOUs.

You should try and get your money to MtGox or BitStamp (which will probably involve turning it into EUR at some point) and then buy from the exchanges directly. You should spread your order out over time so that you avoid any spikes and don't impact the market. 
You could try localbitcoins. Don't admit to having £10k though, start with a smaller amount, say £1k, if the transaction goes ok then repeat it until you're done. If you live near a big citry and manage to find a seller you can do quite well this way.
As for tax - IANAL but my understanding is you must pay capital gains tax when you turn the bitcoins back into cash (or presumably goods). I suggest you contact an accountant when the time comes to sort this out.

To validate someone you send yubikey the ID and the encrypted counter. Yubico validate that the counter really belongs to this ID, and that it (or a higher value) hasn't been used before.
It's not the best security model in the world - the key risks being yubico could be compromised, or if someone has access to your key they could generate a bunch of codes offline that will be valid until you next login. However it does the job and it's far far better than not having 2-factor authentication.

What would it achieve? With blockchain all the sensitive data is decrypted locally. Once an attacker has the encrypted data and the password it's game over. It doesn't matter even if you didn't send any coins.
What 2FA does is prevent the blockchain server from sending you the encrypted data, so although the attacker has your password he doesn't have anything to decrypt.

Right, bitcoin removes some of the reasons to have a bank account, but not all of them, that's my point.


Banks (the ones that do the manupilating according the the blogger) can issue corporate credit notes that represent fiat. These banks could just as easily issue credit notes for bitcoins. Why would anyone want these? The same reason people want it today, because it's an investment - the system wouldn't change much.
As for Gox, sure they could reveal the owners of each order, but so could a conventional exchange. There's nothing bitcoin specific here. The tracability or bitcoin is moot since the exchanges (both MtGox and NYSE) have know-your-customer rules.

This is all good stuff. However doing completely offline transactions is complecated as you can see. For most people I'd suggest keeping some liquid bitcoins in a two-factor blockchain.info wallet for day-to-day transactions. When you need to access your offline wallet savings then import then entire wallet into your online wallet, move the coins you want to spend into a regular online wallet, and put the rest onto a brand new unused offline wallet.
Note that it's always safe to put more coins into an offline wallet.

Simplest way is this:
* Download a fresh linux distribution to a USB stick and boot from it.
* Load up bitaddress.org -&gt; paper wallet
* Physically disconnect your computer and printer from the internet.
* Generate a new wallet 
* print it out (or if truely paranoid just write it down)
* Power cycle your devices.
A few other points to remember:
* Spending coins compromises the wallet, so the only safe thing to do is to move all coins from the wallet, throw it away and use a new one.
* Practice the processes before putting significant funds to paper.
* If the paper is destroyed / stolen, so is your money. You may want secure backups.
* Encrypted paper wallets (BIP 0038) would **massively** increase security, shame there is no easy website for them yet :(

You need to think about what the gap means. Basically it represents the effort / risk of buying bitcoins from bitstamp selling them on MtGox and wwaiting for the funds to clear. Clearly this isn't an exact science, but the consensus is that it costs $10 in every $200 to do this.
Now lets say you're an experienced trader, you've been doing this trade for a while, you know how it works. You look at both the markets, if the gap is &gt; $10 you think "yay, I can get more money that usual, I'll do it!". If the gap is &lt; $10 you think "I might as well buy bitcoins on MtGox to sell on bitstamp, it will be at a loss but less than usual" so you do the trade in reverse.
If enough people think this way (and evidently they do), then the spread is maintained at a constant level on a second-by-second basis.

It's unlikely anyone would (or could) ban bitcoins, however they will almost certainly be subject to the same anti money laundering rules that cash is subjected. This would be:
* Any large BTC transactions in or out of financial institutions would be heavily audited. Institutions must know their customers and know how they make their BTC.
* Employees working for financial institutions will be obliged to alert relevant authorities if they see BTC transactions that raise 'red flags'.
* It's possible that individuals or companies may be banned from accepting large BTC transactions directly (obviously hard to audit for individuals, but not too hard to audit for companies).
Incidentally there's nothing new here. Cash has been subjected to this sort of regulation for decades.

Technically you could keep the tainted outputs separate to the non-tainted outputs even within the same address.

Hmm, I think they mean the revenue SR makes, not the turnover. Assuming the SR takes 10% then that makes the SR responsible for 3-5% of all transactions. It actually takes less than 10%, and of course any hedged trade on SR is [probably] counted twice in MtGox. It's still pretty significant.

Dude, the libertarian / agorian perspective has a lot going for it. However communised roads are perhaps one of the few great triumphs of public planning - where the US has indeed set the model for the rest of the world!
Lack of competition for transportation is indeed a problem in the US. However if you look at the parts of the world where public transport is affordable and effective (e.g. Switzerland, Denmark, Japan, ...) you will also find higher taxes, large public infrastructure projects, and subsidies for public transport.
One thing where I agree with you that a more libertarian attitude would really help is congestion. Simply charge people more for driving at peak times until congestion is not a problem. However it's tricky to enforce, so that would mean more rules / more thugs / more shiny badges. And is a pay-as-you-drive system really a freer system? Which would you rather?

Ah, yeah this is a fairly geeky story, you need to be fairly well versed in bitcoin to follow it:...
Double Spend: This is where you spend the same bitcoins twice. Obviously if you could do this easily then bitcoin simply would not work. It's actually not possible unless you perform a 51% attack (where you have more than 51% of the mining power). It's theoretically possible for miners to put their resources towards such an attack, but under normal circumstances they shouldn't want to do this as they would make more money mining. I'm describing a scenario where it's actually more lucrative for miners to go rogue and perform a 1-off attack on the network.
Satoshidice:  probably the biggest bitcoin gambling site, and so an obvious target for scams like this.
You should probably check out the FAQ and Myths section in the sidebar ---&gt; It covers some of this terminology.

I'm going to be a pragmatist here, this sounds like FUD to me:
* Suggesting that governments are involved in petty criminal activity (DDOS attacks) to take down bitcoin is an extraordinary claim and therefore requires extraordinary evidence. Much more likely is that it's just the hacking community seeing if they can influence the bitcoin price for nefarous purposes.
* Regulation is the norm in the finanacial industry. I realise that many people here feel that any government intervention is an attack on our rights, but if you look past that you'll see a government trying to do what it always does to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. Will it work? Possibly not. But that doesn't make it an attack.
* 15k BTC / 2million dollars is small change in the big financial world out there. We can't know why they did the trade, perhaps they were a SR dealer who just received a huge order and wanted to hedge? It could possibly even be an attempt at market manipulation - however to suggest that it's government endorsed is another bold claim and requires stronger evidence.
I'll probably be hit by a hail of downvotes for saying all this, but if you're going to claim there is a conspiracy against bitcoin I'd like to see stronger evidence.

This is not a very good way of thinking of bitcoins. A better model is to think of bitcoins as a public ledger. When you 'own' a bitcoin it simply means there's a public record that says your public key has bitcoins. If you create a transaction that says "pay bitcoins from crasher_ptPublicAddress to bobPublicAddress" and sign it with crasher_ptPrivateKey then the network updates the ledger accordingly. Nobody needs to see bob's private key for this to happen.

Err entropy does work that way. Let me demonstrate: Here's an electrum passphrase:

128 bits of entropy, right? But what if I told you I picked it randomly from this list:
    air describe choose anyone eternal awake spoken bottom make outside forgive childhood
    engine stone parent bring bowl tightly strange everywhere hug coward outside water
Now the very same passphrase only has 1 bit of entropy!
It's the same with your example. Randomly generate an english sentence = lots of entropy, pick a sentence from a book / film = not so much entropy. Randomly choose a sentence from every film script ever written = a reasonable amount of entropy, pick a sentence from a film that you've seen and happens to stick in your mind = not very much entropy.

The paper wallet will have it's own keys. (Well you could create a paper wallet for a private key you're using elsewhere I guess but it would be entirely pointless)
Once you empty the funds from blockchain.info it really doesn't matter what happens to those addresses and the keys associated with them (assuming you don't want to reuse them).


I strongly recommend you practice creating paper wallets and maybe store $10 on there so you familiarise yourself with the process! Security doesn't matter much for the practice wallet, so feel free to do it at work or whatever.  can create unencrypted or encrypted (advanced options) paper wallets, up to you.

Most of the websites can be run offline. Something like this works:
* Boot to linux
* Load up the website
* Disconnect from the internet
* Generate and print your wallet
* Destroy your computer (or maybe just reboot it, depends how paranoid you are)

You don't need a decent android device to process bitcoins - a basic one will be fine. However I agree the consumer market simply isn't there yet. Currently bitcoin retail is mostly driven by enthusiasts, who likely already have a suitable bitcoin device.
Remeber bitcoin is in its infancy. It may be heresy to say it here but currently I'd only recommend point-of-sale bitcoins to people who are one of three categories:
 * The retailer is a bitcoin enthusiast.
 * The retailers customers are likely to be bitcoin enthusiasts.
 * The retailer does lots of mail business, ideally internationally.

Don't wait for 6 transactions! That level of confirmation is useful if you're buying a house. If you're doing a small transaction then 1 confirmation is plenty. I'd be perfectly happy with an unconfirmed transaction.
Think about it - double spend attacks are expensive to perform, nobody is going to bother for a $50 cab ride or $10 worth of eggs. The simplest varient, a Finney attack, requires the payer to have control over when the payment is made, which is typically not the case in any physical retail situation and defintely not for a cab ride.

Paper wallets are great of course, but my 2/3 idea is stronger because:
* If you steal the paper you can't access the money without my password or access to the bank.
* If the bank goes bust you can get your funds with just the password and the paper.
* If the bank is compromised the attacker can't access the funds.
* If I die my family can retrieve the funds with the paper and the help of the bank.

Encrypted paper wallets are the way to go. Keep the paper somewhere safe at home, keep another copy somewhere else incase your house burns down. Findally write the password in your will and give that to your lawyer.

Most of them.
They picked what they believed was a secure passphrase from an obscure work of literature / film / whatever, from a large pool of potential sentences. The one thing they all have in common is that they picked the passphrase in their head. Which *vastly* reduces the entropy of the sentence. Had they picked randomly they would have been in a much better position.
All this is pretty stupid of course - the cost of bip0038 is tiny, and the protection it grants is huge. Even generating a random sentence is very cheap. Why even take any risks?

I appreciate the sentiment but it helps to think why banks are wary of bitcoin businesses. It's basically because they are unsure of the regulations and they don't want to be on the wrong-end of a money-laundering charge.
Let's say you were to found your own bank and accept custom from bitcoin businesses. What you might find is that the rest of the finance sector gives your bank the cold shoulder. Your bank will be of limited value if you can't transfer funds in and out.
The whole situation is very saddening though. I feel strongly that since mainstream finance is so vital in this day and age, if a bank refuses to serve you without explaining what steps you need to do in order to satisfy regulations is should be seen as discrimination.
The best practical solution is probably to get charities to support bitcoin donations (as has been suggested by others).

Getting a bit off topic, but this is fine as long as it really is random (i.e. you didn't generate it, a computer program did), and as long as you don't use it anywhere else.

1-2% Gosh no! Not even close!
One of the things about mining is that miners are free to choose which transactions to include in a block - they don't have to include any transactions at all if they don't want to. The reason why you include a fee is to help persuade miners to include your transaction. In principle there's a free market on fees, but in practice there are guidelines that basically say the fee should be 0.0001 BTC (so about 1 cent) to be included in the next block*. 
One interesting result is that it doesn't matter to the miners how big your transaction is. If you send 0.01 BTC or 1000 BTC it's the same amount of effort for a miner to include your transaction. This means the fee is still about a cent, regardless of how much money you transfer!
*Actually the rules are a bit more complex but it's close enough.

It's not that the rigs you could buy now are worse than the rigs you got 6 months ago, it's just that the older rigs have 6 months profitable mining under their belt. ROI on mining rigs is never guranteed, since nobody knows the future difficulty or the future valuation of bitcoins. However by most estimates of bitcoin difficulty and value your reasoning is correct.

Generally confirms are overrated.
The easiest 0 confirm attacks (Finney attacks) require the attacker to be a miner and to be able to time his attack to a very small ~30-60 second window. So if you're doing a face-to-face transfer it's impractical.
A classic double spend where you send the same inputs to two people is relatively easy to do, but is thwarted with by a single confirmation. Also bitcoin client software would be able to see that the attack is being attempted.
Attacks that break multiple confirms are entirely theoretical at the moment. They are only worth doing on incredibly large amounts and would require significant mining resources on the part of the attacker. If you're buying a house with bitcoins then definitely wait for 6 confirms - however most people with large amounts of mining reasources are incentivised to make the platform succeed and a double spend would undermind that completely!
**TL;DR** Zero confirms is fine for petty-cash amounts. Otherwise one cofirm for all but the most expensive of purchases.

Remember mining is a competative market. Some miners could insist you pay a fraction of the transaction value, but if another miner says "screw it, 3 cents is better than nothing I'll take it" then those miners will include your transactions and pocket the fee.

You're assuming there's a strong correlation between mining for a nefarious pool and destabalising bitcoin. The situation right now is less black-and-white, for example ghash.io have probably too much power, but nobody is suggesting they are nefarious.
But anyway in either situation selfish (and possibly even rational) miners can lead to pools having too much power.

So the way I see it there are two levels of anonanymity: Plausible deniability, and genuine untraceability.
For plausible denability is should be sufficient to put a single node in between, like so:
* Me -&gt; X -&gt; You
Sure you can show I paid X, and that X paid you, but I can always claim that X was someone else. You'd never be able to prove either way.
It's hard to be genuinely untracable. Though one easy way is with a third party who has two wallets (X and Y). I can then do this:
* Me -&gt; X
*       Y -&gt; You
	  
As long as the 3rd party isn't compromised this is untraceable. This is essentially how mixing services work.

Where are you going with this? Sure you can convince yourself that bitcoin only has an upside - there are plenty of posts like that already.
There are downside risks too. Setting aside the risk that bitcoin gets replaced by another cryptocurrency, there's also the possibility that bitcoin has more-or-less reached saturation. A lot of the current value of bitcoin is based on speculation and if that fails to deliver then you could imagine speculative investors slowly selling thier bitcoin assets over the next few years.
On the money laundering front, this gets harder all the time due to improved captal controls at exchanges. Coupled with constant law enforcement action and improved analysis on the blockchain, it will be increasingly harder to launder money via cryptocurrencies. Finally the movement to legalise marijuana is gaining momentum and would undermine the Silk-Road business model.
Financial transaction fees are very high, but there are many technologies that have the potential to lower these. Admittedly bitcoin is a strong candidate, but paypal, google checkout and many many smaller players have all got their eyes on this area. Who knows how it will turn out?
I'm not saying bitcoin is doomed, but we all need to stop the circlejerk and consider the downsides from time to time!

Bitcoin *only* has value because other people think it will be useful - that is they beleive that they can or will be able to buy something with it. Remove this utility and teh value will fall.
However declaring it illegal doesn't mean it can't be used for purchases. Some purchases are hard to prevent even when they are illegal (e.g. drugs through the post, online gambling, ransom demands). Furthatmore it's nearly impossible to prove if a payment has taken place or not. 
Ultimately it's the enforcability of the law that matters, and it's hard to imagine an enforcable law banning bitcoin payments. It would be even less effective than similar laws that ban piracy.

* Banks pay interest on credit balances.
* Banks can lend you money at interest.
* Banks are centralised, and thus provide an easy point to enforce regulation.

Using the buyer's computer isn't a complete disaster in some circumstances. You should be worried about security but you could setup a temporary / throwaway online account with just enough funds to cover a specific transaction.

Is just as true for dollars as it is for bitcoin. When a bank pays a counterparty the counterparty real dollars, not 'IOU's. [ignoring the question of how 'real' is the dollar for now...].
Whenever a bank lends money, it lends real dollars. The borrower withdraws those dollars and give them to someone else. The moment those dollars leave the bank they have to be as real as the paper dollars in your wallet. The 'IOU' dollars are held by the depositors (and bond-holders and other creditors), not the borrowers.
The actual mechanics of how this happens get quite complicated. Particularly if you pay from your account into someone else's account rather than as cash. However think about it this way - if the receiving bank has the opportunity to demand cash from the sending bank, do you think they will pass that up and take an IOU instead? Would you do the same? Of course not!

Well the coloured coins trade at a premium to other bitcoins and aren't fungible with them. So coloured coins very much affect fungibility!

I'm not quite sure I follow your argument. (and I'm confused about what my nick is suggesting to you?). I'm going to speculate along a couple of lines, forgive me if I've misunderstood you...
* 1. You can still use bitcoins effectively and profitably without knowing anything about mining. Just like you can be a successful entrepreneur without know much about economics. I'm sorry if I gave an impression that you *must* learn about mining to be effective.
* 2. Incase you're wondering - the reason why lots of people have become rich through mining, and yet you can't, is because they were early adopters. Just like buying apple stock when they were a 2 man outfit running from a garage would have made you rich.
* 3. I was a bit lazy in that I didn't explain *why* mining is not profitable for most people. Basically you need cheap electricity, and specialist hardware (or lots of capital) to turn a profit. The good news is that you can do unprofitable mining with pretty much any computer hardware - hence why it makes for an easy learning exercise.
I hope that helps avoid confusion.

You'll lose most people with this point I'm afraid - it's perfectly possible to have an asset without backing (e.g. USD, Gold). Without this axiom the rest of your argument isn't necessary.
**However** *The good news is that all is not lost!* For various reasons some people might seek a cryptocurrency backed by physical assets. Let's skip the question for now of how you setup a trustworthy legal and logistical framework for this, and pretend that 'a respectable law firm in Singapre etc' can just do this with no major headaches. How are you going to establish your cryptocurrency on top of this? Well you have three options:
* Fork bitcoin and setup a brand new blockchain for your new physical-backed-cryptocurrency.
* Like the above but use merged mining to validate your currency, like namecoin does.
* Use coloured coins.
The first two options fall appart pretty quick. Not only are they logistically difficult to do, you also need to provide a reward to initial miners - equivalent to the block reward - which due to how you've constructed your currency is going to be VERY expensive.
However coloured coins are a viable option. You can issue coloured bitcoins that represent asset-backed-coins. People can buy them with bitcoins so you have no funding problems. People will be free to choose between your asset-backed-coloured-coins, or the regular bitcoins as they wish. Even better you can leverage the existing blockchain / mining infrastructrue since as long as the fees are the same miners won't care what they are validating!
**TL;DR** Colored bitcoins are really cool!

I don't think you understand how yubikeys work, basically it's like this:
* 1. User sends yubikey secret to the application.
* 2. Application asks Yubico: "Is this secret good for this user?"
* 3. Yubico says yes (if it is good)
* 4. Application then allows user to spend his money.
This is fine for 2FA, but it's no good for primary security because:
*You have to trust Yubico*. If Yubico is compromised so are all users ever. If connections to Yubico go down then the server cannot determine if the user is allowed or not.
*You have to trust the application*. If the application is compromised  then it can allow full access to any user.
There are some more subtle weaknesses as well. If I have access to your yubikey I can steal an arbitrary number of logins which would be valid until you next login yourself. Encryption is symetric which means that a malicious Yubico could emulate any user they want to do what they like (rather than just grant users access any time they request it, which is a much weaker freedom). It's not anonymous so Yubico could tie key usage back to users. etc etc.
Don't get me wrong, their product is a very good one, I use it myself, but it's *only* good for 2FA. Nothing else.

Gloating about the price of bitcoin is just a way of saying "I bought bitcoins early and made a ton of money and you didn't". Whilst I understand the attraction, it appears rather crass to those outside the community. It's of no technical consequence to users adopting bitcoins. I would advise against doing this.

I'm not saying it's not secure / too secure per se. The benchmark here is fiat money, which requires no hashing because you trust the central bank. Now cryptocurrencise / fiat money are what they are, they each have pros and cons. One plus point of fiat money is that it's incredibly efficient (economically speaking).

True - but as you acknowledge this is a theoretical economists' game. One could take the bitcoin protocol and replace the mining protocol with a central authority that only accepts transactions from registered addresses. Then you'd get the frictionless nature of bitcoin and the theoretical efficiency of fiat. There might still be some security / hosting costs, but you'd be hard pressed to argue these are more than bitcoin mining.
In practice it's not a fair comparison since almost all the economy is on fiat currently and next to none is on bitcoin. Who knows where the costs would lie should bitcoin take over - but you can imagine that bitcoin comes with increased mining and security costs on top of the existing AML costs that FIAT must pay. Sure you save on anti-counterfeiting but I'd speculate that this is small in comparison.
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:50:10
Most people don't regard bitcoin as a serious threat to fiat. It's quite a leap to suggest that any government departments take the non-mainstream view that bitcoin is a serious threat. Do you have any evidence that some governments belive this?
Even if the goverment does plan to stop bitcoin, why would they do it secretly? PGP is a much bigger threat to how goverments operate and yet western governments are clear about what they do to prevent people using it.
@_date: 2013-10-14 09:42:36
To be fair they are naturally skeptical - and rightly so. Sure bitcoin has done well but it's still some way a long way from investment grade. By all means invest in bitcoin but understand it is a gamble.  The standard investment advice still applies: never gamble more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-05-05 06:55:56
Why do people think that a 51% attack is the preferred vector for shutting down bitcoin anyway? It's expensive to perform and doesn't stop small transactions. It's also highly visible. If anyone were to do it you'd get a massive Streisland effect ("gee, if the government thinks this is worth destroying it must have a lot going for it").
Realistically bitcoin is much more analogous to bittorrent. It's both hard and pointless to ban the protocol for both technical and legal reasons. Instead you must go after the applications. For bittorrent this means the tracker sites, and for bitcoin this means the exchanges.

I accept this argument for purchaes. However I struggle to see how it follows for loans.
In an inflationary environment if I have spare money I should lend it out to try and seek a return since if I leave it in my pocket it will be worth less in future.
In a deflationery environment there's no incentive for me to lend out the money since if I leave it in my pocket it will be worth more in future.

Laptops are a bad example. If you buy a laptop today you can be [almost] certain it will be worth less in 6 months time. Yet people still buy laptops. QED, the Austrians win - right?
The argument usually centers around lending rather than transactions in general. Why should I lend at risk when if I hold I can get a guranteed return? If nobody lends that would be disasterous for the economy [probably].
But there are lots of unknowns. Firstly there's a gaping chasm between an economy that has bitcoins in it, to one that runs on bitcoins. We're used to handling gold which is essentially a deflationary asset, and it doesn't have much bearing on our day-to-day economic policies.
Secondly a lot depends on how much the economy deflates. If it's only a little amount then it won't matter, if it's a huge amount then it would [might?] quickly become unworkable.
This argument isn't simple...

@_date: 2013-11-20 16:03:53
It's hard to speculate about the effects of blocksize, it's a complicated topic.


In principle if 51% of nodes were corrupt they could make anything appear in the blockchain for clients that didn't download the entire chain. However it's unlikely to happen and there are ways to trust specific known-good nodes to prevent this.


6 is an arbitray number. I always trust 1 confirm for transactions &lt; $50k. It's actually very difficult and very expensive to perform attacks after 1 confirm. I trust 0 confirms for transactions up to $1k, or tansactions up to $10k where the sender has no control on the time of the transaction. It's a bit technical but double spends are quite hard to perform even with 0 transactions.
Re: Illegal transactions


It's a bit simplistic. One presumes that in the future it wont be hard to funnel large sums into and out of bitcoin. Also one assumes that criminals can use techniques to spread their ballance over many addresses. However bitcoin does leave a trace. Forever. Which actually makes it worse than cash in many respects for money laundering.
Timed transactions don't exist. It could be done as an extension to the protocol (hard fork). It's not under active consideration right now I don't think.


In exactly the same way that hiding cash works. If you're in debt baliffs look for evidence of wealth and sealable assets. Cash in your underpants is not siezable, your car and your house are. Life wit lots of money but no car and no house is awkward. Join the dots.


This is sepculative, but if transaction fees rise then small transactions must take place off the blockchain. Transaction fees might rise if the block size does not, since only 7 transactions can happen per second it must be the transactions with the highest fees that get confirmed.

Primecoin tries this. Its problems are twofold:
* Determining if a number is prime isn't quite the same as a cryptographic hash, for one thing it's hard to verify that a number really is prime.
* The practical usefulness of large prime numbers is dubious at best.
Underlying this question is the idea that mining is 'wasteful' and so the search should be on to find a better method. Finding an economically useful hashing function is unlikely - and even if you do find something that fits the bill the value is unlikely to match the resources sunk into mining.
You may also wish to check out proof of stake systems, which is another approach to solving the wstefulness of mining.
Incidentally if you're willing to consider fantasy mining systems... One could imagine a SETI mining system where whenever you find extra terrestrial life (or maybe just a Xenoplanet) that is previously unknown you get to submit a block - well why not?

No one person can change this limit, but if the community as a whole agress then this limit could be changed - just like anything else about bitcoin.
The limit doesn't have to change though, if it's not increased then only transactions with the highest fees would be accepted (which is probably a bad thing, but not necessarily). It's actually a hot topic at the moment. There's a lot of debate about what this limit should be change to.

Right exactly, the letters have no intrinsic value, arrange them into words and they do [though it's a poor analogy because letters aren't scarce].

One of the great things about bitcoin is that you're completely free to do this. However miners may choose to ignore your transactions. It can take days for small 0 fee transactions to be confirmed. Pay whatever you think is reasonable - it's up to you. However miners aren't stupid, so don't bother trying to game the system by paying 1 satoshi, it won't help.
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:12:47
We'll never know why miners choose to operate at a loss, but even if some / all of them choose to quit the game the coins will still be discovered.
The supply is kept constant through mathematics. At a basic mathematical level if just one PC was still mining we could be assured that the coins would still be disovered over the next ~120 years or so.

My point is that I don't actually hold my fiat, my bank does. If someone were to torture me for it they would have to either accompany me to a bank to withdraw it, or leave an electronic trail of the money. Either would give very strong clues to their identity afterwards.
For bitcoin it isn't necessary to do either of these. Hence it's a lot easier to perform.

I don't think so. That's not to say nobody will every try it on, but I think if you maintain the fiat value of the trade it's a much fairer starting piont than maintaining the BTC value.
Think of it this way. I hold bitcoin, the price goes up, I'm now a millionare. Woohoo - time to buy a lamborghini! 
Now lets say the gearbox fails, I take it back to the shop and get a refund and they only give me half the dollar value back. I'd be pretty annoyed.
The thing is I'd have never bought the car in the first place unless bitcoins had got to a certain value. By buying the car I'm essentially fixing the value of bitcoins at that point.
Look at it the other way: If the shop refunds me twice the value of the car, well that's lovely, but it's certainly not what I was expecting. I'd have been happy with the value of the car.

You need to be more specific:
* Top graph: line = price, bars = volume
* Bottom graph: line = how much is available to buy/sell, bars = how much has this line moved
* Right hand side: List of recent trades.
The bottom bar chart is pretty confusing. Essentially if you see a green bar at price x it means "more people are willing to buy/sell at price x than they were 10 minutes ago", and if it's red it's "less". It's also not very meaningful so you could happily live the rest of your life never understanding it.

That theory works only if there's some evidence of a 51% attack being performed elsewhere in the network. I'm not aware of any. A better reason would be so that your pool can claim a bigger market share.

Hard to say. In the big scheme of things Bitcoins are still a niche interest. However the cost of accepting bitcoin is miniscule - as cheap as putting "Bitcoins accepted here" on your website.

If your website is not bitcoin related, I suggest you just direct curious people to weusecoins.com, or even this subreddit.


Blockchain.info + two factor authentication. Novices tend not to run large balances anyway and for novices with small amounts the risk of you screwing up is far greater than anything else.


Check the subreddit Basically the bot holds balances on behalf of your username, and if you issue a command it will transfer the balances to another username (or into your wallet, depending on the command). You do have to trust the bot completely. That's why people only use toy amounts of money.

'Race Attack' is much better terminology, I'll use that :)
The Finney attack is guaranteed to work, whereas a race attack isn't (unless most miners run that patch I guess). You could make a replace-by-fee attack invisible, but at the cost of only giving it a chance of success.

It's a tradeoff. The exchanges post better rates, but by the time you've paid bank transfer fees and the like the you won't get anywhere near that rate.
Alternatively localbitcoins has UK sellers, so there's less delay. The headline rate is slightly more but might still be economical.
Pro tip: Timing matters. Sometimes the localbitcoins spread is wider than others. Also it never hurts to contact the seller and ask if there's any wiggle-room on price.

Chances are you've been caught up by some Anti-money-laundering (AML) red flag. One of the things about AML reporting is that you can't inform the client that they are under investigation - hence the vagueness.
There are rules about this (google is your friend). After a certain time period (a week I think) they have to remove the blocks *or* tell you what's up. Patience is your friend here. After than the bank will either let you get on with your business, close your account, or investigate you formally for money laundering (probably not in your case!).
The banks are between a rock and a hard place here. If they let a bad transaction through they get beaten up for money laudnering. If they hold you up for too long they get beaten up for not being efficient. is one of the worst places for this.

With instawallet you don't actually hold your balance, they do. When you put money into the address you've been given, instawallet will pick it up and sweep it into their central account. Then when you want to withdraw money you send a request to instawallet and they will send the bitcoins to you from one of their central accounts.
Instawallet are acting more like a bank than a wallet. Also the URL mechanism they use is incerdibly unsafe. Consequently instawallet is not recommended for more than spare change. Use a blockchain.info wallet instead.

It's tempting to say "My bitcoins are worth more because the Fed is constantly printing dollars and so the value of the dollar decreases each year". This is not the case. Actually right now there are more bitcoins minted (relative to the supply of bitcoins) than there are dollars printed. The reason why your bitcoins are going up is due to the increased interest in bitcoins.
In principle, at some future point in time bitcoins will be useful as a way of avoiding inflation. However this would be in at least 3 years, and bitcoin is so volatile it's extremely difficult to say anything with certainty about bitcoins in 3 years time.

As online wallets go, blockchain.info is one of the best. The biggest risks are:
* Weak passwords
* Keyloggers
* Easy access to the wallet 'backup' email.
* Blockchain.info being hacked.
One top tip: **You must enable two-factor authentication**, both on blockchain.info and on your email account. This stops most keyloggers (but not all - which is why the paranoid insist on offline wallets). 
You can download a browser plugin which will warn you if blockchain.info is hacked. If this were to happen your funds would be perfectly safe, unless you login to a site that looks like blockchain.info but is in fact a disguise put up to steal your funds. Separating your liquid cash from your long term savings would also be prudent here.
One final idea - setup a brainwallet with the same password and put a few coins in there (make sure you don't have a keylogger when you do this, perhaps do it offline). Once they are stolen you know it's time to change your password!

Before people had credit cards (and even today), you used to be able to get a refund for an item bought with cash as long as you could produce a recipt. Of course if the merchant was unscrupulous - or even worse no longer present! - this could pose a challenge. There was no credit card processor to fall back on. This is where bitcoin is at right now.
There's no reason why credit cards / paypal should  not continue to provide consumers protection in a bitcoin ecosystem (and presumably also charge for the privilege). This is a win for everyone since consumers can choose to pay slightly more for piece of mind, or pay a few % less and trust the merchant.
Generally if the pricing is in fiat I'd expect the refund to be the same amount of fiat even if the BTC price has changed.

The problem with roads is  that it's hard to imagine how two competing road systems would work in practice. Roads, for all their benefits, take up a lot of space and cost an immense amount of real-estate, could we really have two competing systems?
However we can look at what came before roads. Canals and railways. Both had a rich history of private development in the UK, but companies likes to make their transport systems slightly incompatible with the competition (think Microsoft). Take a look at these examples:
* 
* 
In both cases government overruled the companies and forced them to inter-operate.
Perhaps it wasn't necessary, perhaps it's ok for you to have to decide if you want a Microsoft car that runs on microsoft roads, or an apple car that runs on apple roads? Perhaps history won't repeat itself?
If you want more examples of roads, look at the developing world. Generally the story is that nobody has the money to build the road and so all commerce in the area suffers as a result. If the EU or China come in and build roads to an area, suddenly small commerce is possible. Of course this is a classic Keynesian investment (or possibly communist even?), but you only have to visit these places to see how effective it is.

I'm not sure I follow. I don't see how deflation encourages higher or lower risk lending. I just makes *any* lending very expensive.
The person making a loan will only see a return if the rate on the loan is higher than the rate of deflation. For example if the economy is deflating 10% a year then the rate needs to be &gt; 10% before you even consider lending. This sort of rate tends to attract higher risk schemes.

I accept your point that the competence is much higher - however the sheer number of globally distributed robust altcoins suggests that setting these things up is cheaper than a traditional distributed RDBMS.




Well it means a database where multiple companies can enter records. Usually this is done via a central authority (e.g. title deeds, bond ownership, securities clearing). The central authority is required because it's very expensive / difficult to distribute any other way. A blockchain could solve this problem.


Narrow indeed. If the parties trust a central adjudicator then there's no need for proof-of-work, or proof-of-stake. It's sufficient just to sign your contributions.
I've seen people suggest that "distributed ledger" is a better generic term and "blockchain" is a specific solution (thus ripple would be a public distributed ledger not a blockchain, and one could still have private blockcains). Point is the technological inventions would be useful in both public and private spaces.

Whenever you make a payment from strongchain, strongchain charge a 1% fee. This means that at the point you ask for a payment strongchain must have access to the private key in order to make this charge. 
My guess is one of two things happen:
* When you make a payment you send the private key to strongchain, they build a charge to themselves into the transaction. At this point it's trivial to intercept the stolen funds.
* Or... The transaction logic is all done clientside but strongchain put a back-door into the javascript for this specific account to catch the decrypted key and report back to base.
**Edit:** Just looked through Strongchain's javascript. Looks like they do all the transaction management clientside. This means that is must have been the second scenario- some custom javascript was delivered to the theif's account when he logged in.

I'd say it's marginally worse since browsers, and to some extent users, don't always consider the URL as 'secret'. Instawallet was hacked basically because chrome browser would send URLs to google for caching. Apparently putting a # in the URL prevents this.

Yup, You can see it in blockchain.info. It's easy to spot since it's always the first transaction in any block and is always a fraction above 25 BTC (reward + fees), e.g: 


You could change the address for the reward to be your address, and if you get lucky you can keep the entire reward. However if you only get some bits you can't submit it to the pool as proof of work so you won't are any shares if someone else gets the reward. This is of course identical to solo mining! ;)

No company can pay cash to an unverified person and pass a tax audit. (Though I'm sure some small companies will get away with tax evasion this way since most tax authorities don't have the capacity to audit everyone).

The other thing you need to realise is that miners are heavily invested in bitcoin. As you point out, a single 51% attack would hurt them more than anyone else, so they will actually conspire to ensure that the hash rate is distributed. Even though the number of players will shrink, we're pretty safe.
The real risk is when the reward halves and mining is no longer profitable. It's possible that miners will consipre to perform a single large 51% attack before leaving the mining game. That's a risk - but there's not much that can be done to stop it I don't think, other than hope the bitcoin price rises enough to keep mining profitable.

Gold, Oil and Wheat are all fininte and have very effective derivative markets! Actually fiat is finite too - in the sense that investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Barclays etc can't issue new fiat (only central banks can do this). The whole point of the derivatives market is to trade when you don't have the underlying product! ;)
The very language of 'threts' is misplaced, you talk about the federal bank as though it's a commercial entity that wants to profit, or a politicial entity that wants power. In reallity it's a public entity that exists only to push and pull economic levers. Bitcoin has no such levers and so has no analagous institution. In the hypothetical bitcoin economy people might wish for economic levers to push in times of recession and the like, but nobody will fight for the central bank per-se.

A lot of people here are from the crypto-geek crowd, so they will ask for things like provably fair gaming, separate storage of private keys, etc etc. Of course these are all great ideas, but let's park them for now and look at what a mainstream consumer might want.
I think people will want to play games for regular dollars, and will want to play with other dollar players. So the best thing would be to accept bitcoins as payment and convert them into dollars so they can play alongside everyone else. When they cash out you can turn them back into bitcoins.
Technically you could either intergrate with coinbase, or do the trading yourself on bitstamp / mtgox. The latter will require a decent development team, and you'll have to think through the security implications, but in reality it's not that hard to do yourself.
I've no idea how the regulation might look - I suggest you don't allow players to pay bitcoins and receive winnigs as dollars, or you'll end up being a back-door bitcoin exchange! On the security side I'm guessing the gambling industry is already on top of the whole KYC / internal security stuff, so just keep up the good practices.

I do feel that sometimes credit cards get a bad press. They do have some things in their favour over and above other electronic payment mechanisms. In particular:
* Buy now pay later (the clue is in the name ;) )
* Buyer protection if the trade goes bad.
Bitcoin (alone) will never be able to provide these, so the credit card does have a place in the world of business. 
However the dishonest part is tricking customers into believing that they get these services for free! Frankly 3% is a bargain for buyer protection and in many cases (e.g. consumer electronics) I won't mind paying it. However some things are never going to fail (e.g. dinner at a restaurant) and it's a rip-off.
The important thing about this ruling is that customers will be able to decide fairly if they think the extra protection is justified by the costs. This will allow a fair market for payment processing.

Nothing particularly exciting. They will no doubt auction the assets in chunks over several weeks to get a fair price from the market.

Some services claim to do this but have yet to be proven / trusted.

**If you are going to trust a 3rd party with your money - even briefly - make sure you perform your own due diligence!**. Also if you're paranoid you should assume that the FBI (etc) already monitor the server logs of these systems. Doesn't mean you can't use them still, but use a VPN / TOR.

Sounds like he's confusing bitcoin with a centralized coin (LibertyDollars, FacebookCoin, World-of-warcraft Gold, etc).

Well there's two options, buy food / rent from someone who will accept bitcoins. Or find a 3rd party to act as a middleman to take your coins any pay the person who only accepts cash.
Both are feasible to some extent, but right now in all honesty the market isn't mature enough yet.


No. You turn computer hardware and electricity into money. It' a bit like turning mining machinery + miners salary into gold is saying it's "free gold".


Sure. The thing is a bitcoin is worth about £65, so if you want to buy a £8 game then you only need to pay part of a bitcoin. Bitcoins can be divided into *tiny* pieces with ease.




Of course - but only trade from reputable sources.


This is a complicated topic. The basics protocols are extremely secure, you can't break it just because a miner is in a bad mood. However every bitcoin user must take care of their own private keys, if these are lost or stolen your money is gone. For the average user you need to make sure you use a 10+ character long password to look after your bitcoins and never use this password for anything else.


Basically a wallet is a file that holds your private keys. Since it's like any other file it can be stored on your hard drive, or a USB key, or even on dropbox, or you can give someone else a copy to look after. For beginners the easiest way is to have someone else look after it, just create an account at  and start with that as your wallet.

If you buy 1 bitcoin now, then no matter what happens to the exchange rate, you'll only have 1 bit coin in future. Like any investment, the reason why you do it is because you expect better returns. If you buy satoshidice shares then they should pay you a dividend regularly, and you could sell the shares in future and maybe make a profit.
There are risks of course. Generally the risk is that the company in question goes bust (or does a runner with your money!). If this happens then you'll lose your investment.
With bitcoins you need to be extra careful as to how you invest, as there's a chance that the company you invest through could also go bust (or do a runner).
The general rule for any investment (bitcoin or otherwise): **Only invest what you can afford to lose**.

Not 100% buying your premise, but let's run with it for a bit...
Fortunately the blockchain provides a public ledger of every transaction ever. This is vastly more transparent and traceable than any other transaction system ever invented. It would be pretty trivial to provide a mechanism that allows for government registration / verification of addresses publicly (on the blockchain even), any transactions to or from unregistered addresses would be illegal.
Possible - yes. Feasable - just about. Desirable - well that's an open question. Obviously it's not going to be desirable to everyone - but it's about the same as what we have now, and most people desire some sort of banking industry.

You're welcome to believe the story you've spun about miners not trying phrase permutations. I think you're wrong - time will tell, and hey it's your money, do what you like. However to understand this story you need to be able to grasp fairly advanced combinatronics and understand about how the psychology of the human mind works. I don't fully understand both these disciplines hence why I like to remove the human brain from the equation. 
There are enough newbies on this forum who understand neither that the advice must be "Don't use brain wallets". Perhaps I should change this to "Don't use brain wallets unless you have a degree level understanding of mathematics and pshycology" but that seems a rather redundant message. 
You don't need me to link you to threads where coins have been stolen from people who believed their password was secure!
Of course security is a tradeoff between effort gone to and security achieved. However if you apply your supposedly strong password to a BIP0038 encrypted wallet it costs you next to nothing and the security you achieve as a result is many orders of magnitude better. Strikes me as foolish not to do this.

Acutally it looks like [BIP 70]( supports requests for an arbitrary output script, so yes you could generate the transaction request on a website and then have your app sign it.

Well the argument is that bitcoin is backed by the "trust in transaction between its users". Dollars are exactly the same, just that one of its users is the US government, and it buys 2.5 billion dollars a year in tax payments.
Exchange rates don't matter (sure the tax bill inflates a bit depending on the economy and the government policy, but for our purposes it's not significant). The only major difference is the sheer size of the 'trust' that the US goverment tax bill brings with it. The value of the tax bill effectively backs the currency, as long as you trust this debt needs to be paid in dollars (a safe bet I'd say!), you can trust dollars have value.
The argument works the other way too. Zimbabwean dollars were issued with the full 'trust' of the Zimbabwean government, but since it issued way to many of them, nobody else really believed they had any value, and so they didn't.

The point about paper wallets / change addresses is quite simple: Once you use a paper wallet for spending, always throw it away and create a new one.

This is a tricky one to call. Yes BACS can be reversed but there is a lot of BACS trading going on and I've bever heard of any complaints. My guess is there are a few factors going on here:
* If you provide evidence of the transaction (i.e. loalbitcoins logs) banks would be willing to accept this as proof that the client intended to give you money.
* In many fraud cases banks will (must?) accept the loss rather than recoup it from the counterparty. 
* Perhaps they lack the means / inclination to chase for small amounts.
There is one danger though, there have been a few cases where bank accounts have been frozen due to bitcoin related transactions being flagged as suspect. There's not much you can do about this, mostly because while you are under investigation banks must not 'tip you off' that an investigation is underway. You should keep good records of where you coins come from, who you customers are, and what taxes have been paid.
As such the best advice is to have a separate account for bitcoin trading.

A bitcoin trading businesses *will* raise flags for obvious reasons. Generally in the financial / AML world the onus is on you to prove you're innocent.  The problem is that these rules are designed to stop drug barons in mexico laundering 6 figure sums through the mainstream banks. Whilst they apply to people with tiny cash flows, both the mechanisms to comply and the mechanisms of enforcement do not scale.
Essentially it's a gamble. In principle you could get jail time and fines just for allowing money laundering to happen. In practice chances are you may get some funds frozen and told to stop it. And of course as long as you go un-noticed you'll be fine.

You don't need to back that up, though it will save you from re-downloading the entire blockchain again.
Far far more important is to make sure you purge (not just delete) your old wallet from your hard drive so that the new owner can't recover it. This is non trival (unless you're willing to smash your harddrive to bits with a hammer).
Actually I wouldn't bother doing *any* of this, it's a pain in the ass. Once you get a new PC install the bitcoin software and create a new wallet. Write down the public address. Now fire up your old pc one last time and send all your money to the new pc's wallet. Now your coins are safely on your new PC and you don't need to worry about what will happen to your old one. Though you should still backup the wallet to a thumdrive incase your house burns down or something like that.

One of the hopes for the Eurpoean Union (and by extension the Euro) was that it would stop the states of Europe from waring with each other. For all it's faults it's been pretty successful at this!

Remember the internet before HTTPS? It had the wild west feel bitcoin has today. HTTPS solves these problems but it's fiendishly complex. I bet nobody reading this knows the HTTPS protocol and how certification works. We just trust our browsers. If the browser has the padlock icon you know you're dealing securely with a known entity.
Bitcoin can actually do better than this. We can prove you are sending money to the known trusted entity you think you are dealing with. However the protocol doesn't say anything about trust - we must build this on top. Blockchain.info tags and CoinValidation are the first steps towards doing this.

So I submit my document to proofofexistance.com before I submit it to Hawkins. I can prove to the world that I wrote the paper in my name before anyone else did, so it's impossible for another person to claim my idea as their own.

At it's heart each address is built from a random string so it technically could be done. The problem is that you have to be very careful. Not every random string is a bitcoin address, they have checksums built in and the like. Most usual encryption mechanisms are capable of telling if they have decrypted ok (try it, you'll get "wrong password" rather than jibberish using most systems out there). 
If you used a different system to everyone else - one where any password was valid but returned a different address each time - anyone trying to extort your passwords would reasonably ask "Why are you using nonstandard encryption? Obviously you are trying to hide something!". They couldn't prove you had 1, 2, or 5000 wallets, but they would know you were up to something unusual.

Let's suppose we change the bitcoin protocol at a technical level so that you can lock your wallet to only send X bitcoins per day. (It could happen - it would requre a hard fork but it wouldn't be inconcievable to mark a partcular output as only allowing spends of X every Y blocks).
Now an attacker steals your credentials and sends some coins. He's capped so he doesn't steal everything - but now what happens? Effectively you end up in an arms race where every morning it's a race between you and the attacker as to who can broadcast the transaction first. You won't win this race since the attacker is a proffessional.
Ah but perhaps there's some uber-secret key that allows you to send more coins? How are you going to keep this key out of the hands of attackers? And in that case why not keep your original key safe using that mechanism? Also why not just have two wallets, one with a small amount and one with a large amount? You can do this today.

Credit-card companies insure you against theft. If you report your card stolen and the theif buys a sandwich (or whatever) the credit card company will pay the bill. However you pay for this insurance (indirectly) with fees.

Well that's what they should do. However there are some exceptions:

* 2. It might be a deliberate attempt to shock the market. The could easily buy back in and make a quick $5 per coin. Not bad it you have the deep pockets and the balls to back it up.
If it is market manipulation don't assume it's nefarious, it's probably just someone trying to make some money - nothing more. Of course in the nice regulated world of stock and bond markets this type of manipulation is frowned upon, but in bitcoin land all this is fair game.

Users can choose any fee they like (including 0) Miners could agree (individually or collectively) to only process transactions with a fee &gt; x.
After that its down to economics. The good news is that accepting transactions helps bitcoin function which indirectly boosts the price and makes mining profitable. So most miners would rather include transactions than not (to a limit).
Since mining is a for-profit enterprise, you expect miners to accept the transactions with the highest fees - be that $100 or 1 satoshi. Ultimately supply and demand dictates the fee.

There's basically 3 types of double spends you can perform with bitcoins:
A regular double spend race is when you send out two competing transactions - one paying the merchant and one paying yourself say. In principle it's hit-and-miss as to which transaction wins (though you can put larger fees onto the transaction to yourself to try and bias it in your favour). Any client would be able to see the double spend taking place, and a single confirm is enough to prevent it.
A Finney attack is when you mine a block but before you publish the block to the world you quickly try and spend some of the inputs elsewhere. Once you've spent the inputs you then release the mined block, which effectively makes the unconfirmed transaction void. This attack requires mining resource and very fine timing. It's (mostly) thwarted by 1 confirm.
A 51% (or near 51%) attack is where the attacker has a large amount of mining resource available. He sends a transaction over the network and in private builds up an alternative blockchain with a competing transaction. You wait for n confirms, but as long as his chain is longer than the public chain he can at any point release his private chain to the public undoing your transaction. The risks for the attack are that this attack is probabilistic - he can't know that his chain will be longer after n confirms, he just has to get lucky.  
The way the maths works out, the bigger n is, the less likely this attack will succeed (unless the attacker has &gt; 50% hashing power, hence why it's a magic number). There's nothing magical about 6, it's just a number that was suggested early on. The problem with this attack, apart from the vast computational resources involved, is that while he's building up his private blockchain, he's not earning income from mining. So this attack is expensive and only worth it for large (huge!) transactions.
It's worth noting that right now near 51% attacks are entirely theoretical. I don't believe one has ever been performed in practice, even for small n. For that matter I'm not aware of any deliberate Finney attacks either.

Bitcoin are held in an address, which looks something like this: 1L8zwSqEmeUE4Yw972XnijuS1a5C1YareD
To be able to spend the coins on an address you need the special 'password' (also called private-key) that goes with that address, it looks like this: 5JddbzDWggFwzCRwD11fCyrFpttavXQ1AqAff1diVfg4k1fhZkv
Normally this private-key, is stored in a file on your computer. However you can print it out onto a piece of paper, and delete the copy on your computer. Now the only place that password is written is on paper - if you like your bitcoins are stored on that piece of paper.
To spend your bitcoins again you enter the private-key into a new computer, and then you can use that computer to spend your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:32:18
This isn't a good idea since your wallet is only as secure as the weakest computer! 
However if you must do it you can. It depends a bit on which client you are using, but essentially you need to export the private key from your wallet into the other one. Most wallet software has a backup / export function and a corresponding restore / import function. Just use this, making sure to be careful about who can see the backups.
Once all the clients have re-synced with the blockchain they should share the same wallet.
Once again I would discourage you from doing this since it's not good practice.

There are techniques for taking a master public key and generating an infinte series of public keys. The holder of the master private key can generate a corresponding series of private keys that unlock each of these public keys.
LBAAT have such a key pair and they promise to reveal a new private key each hour. You can encrypt something with the public key that corresponds to a particular future point in time. You'll only be able to decrypt it once LBAAT reveal their private key to the world.
This is fine but there are risks, in particular:
* LBAAT themselves are compromised. In this case the attacker would have access to all private keys to all points in time. However they would not have your cipher text so they can't read your future message - unless the holder of the message is also compromised.
* LBAAT might decide to stop publishing private keys (perhaps due to hardware failure or similar?). In this scneario you'll never be able to decrypt your cipher text.
Due to these risks I wouldn't trust large amounts of bitcoins with this service alone. Though it's an interesting toy which you could use for some fun games.

Basically expect an interview with your bank. If you can convince them that your bitcoins are legit they will let you keep your money. Obviously this will be a nerve-wracking process since your funds will be locked down at some point. A prudent investor would talk to the bank beforehand.

For the same reason people play roulette, or buy lottery tickets. The interesting thing is that SatoshiDICE has much better odds than both those games. So the question really is why don't more gamblers move to SatoshiDICE - they probably will!
A rational person might argue that there's no point in playing any of these games since you'll net a loss in the long term. You could argue that therefore all players are irrational, and thus gambling is [a tax on the stupid]( and should possibly be banned.
On alternative argument is to think about the [utility of money]( Crudely put it says that an individual would much much rather have $10000 once than $1 10000 times. With the former you could go on holiday or buy a decent car, with the latter you can buy a snack, and even though you can do it much more often, it's worth a lot less to you. Hence it's actually rational to gamble some of your money. It gets complicated to measure as different individuals will have different utility curves.

I disagree with this point. A few people will want this sure. However most people will either want to play dollar games explicitly, or play where there are the most other players (so dollars again).

The key point is to explain how a transaction works, and possibly how the blockchain prevents double spends.
Things like price (or possibly market cap) are interesting. As is bitcoin's suppply.

Here's how mining works:
* 1. The pool generates a list of transactions for signing.
* 2. You add a nonce.
* 3. If the hash of the block+nonce is &lt; x you submit it to the pool owner for a small reward.
Any block &lt; x can be submitted and proves you are working on the problem. If the block's hash is sufficiently low it's actually a valid block on the chain and the pool owner will publish it globally.
This is safe because the block says "pay the 25 BTC reward to the block owner". You could change this to "pay the 25 BTC reward to me", but then the pool wouldn't accept any work you'd done - i.e. you'd be solo mining.

The Keynesian argument with fiat is not that there must be inflation. It's more nuanced than that. Keynes says inflation should be adjusted. Basically interest is high in boom times to encourage saving, and low in lean times (like now) to discourage hoarding and encourage investment.
Sadly this relies on some centralised system to decide what the correct course of action is. Something that's hard to do with cryptocurrencies.

That's not a question we can answer for you - you have to do the sums yourself. A good guide might be how much do you spend on a night out? Let's say it's four beers and pizza ~= $25. So are you willing to 'sacrifice' 4 nights out for a 'fun' investment? Then buy a bitcoin. It might make you rich, but worst case you'll have to sit in front of the TV for a couple weekends rather than go out for a beer.
Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

The writer is proposing a bitcoin-best-practice scheme for legitimate busniesses that want to use bitcoin as part of the mainstream economy. Identification and anti money laundering is key to that. It's worth noting that businesses that handle large amounts of cash effectively do this already. 
He also suggests cumpolsory registration of bitcoin users. I don't quite see how this would be feasable in practice but his point that it would help mainstream adoption is a fair one. However the comparrason with cash seems a good one, if you try and buy a house with cash you can bet some questions will be asked.
He is not proposing changing the protocol to make bitcoin less anonymous or anything like that.
Overall it's a reasonable article with many good points and some interesting ideas. The OP's title is unecessarily negative.

I'm going to borrow an example from Tim Hartfords execllent book "The Undercover Economist".
Suppose you go to a car dealership that sells two kinds of cars: Peaches worth $10,000 and Lemons worth $2,000 (in equal amounts). The problem is that since you're not a mechanic, you can't tell a peach from a lemon. If the dealer doesn't know which is a peach and which is a lemon, then he simply sells all cars for $6,000 - a fair price. Everyone is happy.
However suppose the dealer hires a mechanic, now he knows what the cars are worth, but you don't. If you turn up with $6,000 you'll be sold a lemon because the dealer doesn't want to take a loss on a peach. Equally, knowing he has insider information, you have no reason to trade with him since you know you'll take a loss. Neither of you will trade.
Of course once he reveals which cars are which he can sell his peaches for $10,000 and his lemons for $2,000 and everyone is happy again.
**TL;DR** With insider trading there is NO market.
@_date: 2013-08-20 11:46:27
Heh, you could say that. The thing about bitcoin wallets is that they are only as safe as their weakest point. If you have a wallet on your old PC, then you transfer it to your phone, then you put it on a USB stick, if any of them ever get compromised you will lose your money. 
Alternatively you can pay a cent to never have to worry about keeping your old wallets / devices safe.

You could think of bitcoin as a commodity (like Gold or Oil) if you prefer trading-like analogys. It's definitely not equity since it's not a share in something, doesn't pay dividends or confer voting rites. 
Still I think the FX analogy holds. The key difference is that there's very little really priced directly in bitcoins right now so being rich in worthless bitcoins wouldn't be of much practical value, but then weak economies often peg prices to the dollar too so no difference there.

I don't know why people seem to think bitcoins somehow break tax systems. There are no 'tax codes' for bitcoin, but then there are no 'tax codes' for electric guitars, or cusomized birthday cakes, or mint-in-box-starwars-figures yet people trade them all the time (and pay tax) without any problems.
Generally if you buy bitcoins and sell them at a profit, that would be considered a capital gain and you'd be liable for capital gains tax. If you exchange bitcoins for products you'd be liable for the equivalent gain to the cash value of that product.  Mining is a special case, I imagine that might be considered income and you can deduct the costs of mining from your profits. 
I appriciate this can get complicated very quickly and if it affects you then you should seek advice from a professional accountant. However the exact same issues questions come up in many many other businesses and the solutions are well known.

Well ok - if you generate a transaction from an offline computer and burn the computer afterwards then you're right, the wallet is safe. Most people don't do this.
What most people do is scan the QR code of the private key into armory / blockchain.info for their live computer. You may as well assume the address is compromised at that point!

The correct solution then would be to get vanitygen to add a BIP38 option, which would be a pretty good idea all round.
The risk of encrypting an existing address is that you believe it to be safe when it may already be compromised during the time it was available in plaintext. Although this risk is small it can be entirely avoided by simply moving your coins to a new encrypted address.

Once the reward is significantly less than the transaction fees it's uninisteresting. Currently TXfees are 0.3ish BTC on average - but these need to go up - otherwise miners will call it quits, and that might cause the network to die. 
My (unscientific) cutoff is ~0.2 BTC which is in 7 halving-events.

Here's an analogy:
If you see a penny on the floor you might not bother to pick it up, [it's not worth your time]( If you see $10 you probably would. Now imagine there's deflation such that 1 cent was worth the same as $10 now ~ enough to buy lunch. Then you would bother to pick the penny up.
It's the same with bitcoins. Miners might not bother to validate transactions with tiny fees because it's not worth their time. However as bitcoins become more valuable they will bother to pick up these transactions and so transaction fees will go down.

They can veto transactions, but that's it. They can't make you lose money you already have, and if legitimate operators get control again then it's business as normal. So once 'they' have control of the network, what transactions are they going to veto? Any why? It's not obvious to me!
Best they can do is shutdown the network. Bitcoin will go away in a huge storm of publicity and be replaced by dozens of clones each with innovative solutions to the 51% problem.
Going after exchanges is simple, just prevent them form having bank accounts. This is exactly what has happened in the UK. Sure you can exchange with a few individual operators, perhaps using cash, or you can pay FX rates and transfer to a foreign exchange operator. However it's very inconvenient, far less secure, and the commissions are far higher.

Well being subject to rules and regulations (or if you like, the threat of violence) won't go away with taxes. If the state isn't going to prevent people from driving too fast and killing other people, then local collectives will form to fulfill that role. You might argue that the local collective is 'fairer', but it's always going to be subjective.
So now you have two barriers:
* 1. Demonstrate that without the state the rules would vanish or be significantly different. It's not obvoius that they would be.
* 2. Demonstrate that with significantly different rules, the resulting transportation would be different. Again not obvious.
All subjective of course, but I think you're extrapolating far far too much from the idea that "rules are bad for society". Sure it might help in some areas, but this isn't one of them.

The bitcoin protocol dictates that there should be one block every 10 minutes. [There's no fundamental reason for this choice, it was just made that way and now it's set in stone].

Sorry - your bitcoins are gone.
When you say you transferred to blockchain, did you import the private key into blockchain.info? Or did you send the bitcoins from your paper wallet to your blockchain.info wallet?
Could the attackers got hold of the private key, which might be stored on your computer somewhere - perhaps in an email?

The thing about 51% attacks is that they are highly visible. If a group of mining pools tried it people would notice and switch pool. Worse a successful attack would probably cause the bitcoin price to crash, miners are heavily invested in bitcoin so they will work to prevent this from happening!
A bigger risk right now by far is regulation and the burden it could put on people who use bitcoins.

Someone has to pay for the bandwidth and developer time to pipe this data around the world. Bloomberg and Reuters need to make money somehow. So one of two things has to happen:
* MtGox needs to pay Reuters / Bloomberg to take their data and send it to everyone.
* Bloomberg / Reuters's own customers have to pay Bloomberg / Reuters to get hold of this data and send it to them. (actually since these services are generally subscription based they need only ask, however these companies have finite resources, so unless lots of customers ask they will reasonably think their time is better spent on other stuff).
Evidently neither of these have happened yet. Feel free to speculate why exactly this is. My guess is that not many Bloomberg / Reuters customers need bitcoin prices yet, and those that do have enough technical capability to build their own feeds.

Dividends are usually at the discretion of /any/ company to pay. Of course if you arbitrarily or punitively stop paying dividends you can expect your share price to plummet. So the question becomes is it worth ASICMiner maintaining their share price?
This should be simple to calculate: What's the value of the shares owned by friedcat? How much does he earn from mining? If the mining income over the short term is more than the value of his shares then he should abscond with the equipment. You need to take into account the potential future value of his shares too, and how principled you think he is, but that's the rough maths.

One thing you've not gone into is bitcoin for transfering value. If spreads and exchange fees are 1%, then a near instant risk free global semi-anonymous transaction of any size costs 2% - a significant undercut of every other retail product. This is the killer argument for bitcoin.

You're thinking along the right track. There's nothing that keeps the USD or Gold stable in value, infact they fluctuate a lot vs other assets. This is actually useful in many respects. 
You are right that if the price fluctuates wildly it's less helpful, though most people are capable of pricing things in USD but charging in BTC - exactly what happens in the real world when a currency starts to fluctuate wildly!
There's nothing fundamental to make the price stabalise. One would hope the price fluctuations settle down eventually as bitcoins moves from being a new technology to being saturated in the market - but it could take several years. Until then we can only speculate how things might pan out.
@_date: 2013-05-12 19:54:32
Note this article is really about the bond market not bitcoins. It's also rather dry, as articles about bonds tend to be. Here's an ELI10:
First what is a bond? A bond is an IOU. Give me $100 and I'll give you $5 a year for 10 years then I'll give you the $100 back. The risk is I might go bust or run off with the money. You probably wouldn't trust my IOU, but you would probably trust the US government. Pretty much every large and medium sized company issues IOUs like this (aka corporate bonds). Corporations find it's a good way to make money. Investors find it's a good way to earn income, even though it's risky, especially since right now you can't get any income just by leaving money in the bank (interest rates are low).
So [here's the meat]: US companies have issued ~$9.1 trillion  of bonds. However the bond re-sellers (primary dealers) have only 250 billion of these for sale. The amount issued has grown but the amount for re-sale has shrunk. This is bad as it makes it harder to discover the fair price of bonds, and harder to get out of risky positions quickly.
[This paragraph I'll lift from the article:] While there are many venues to trade corporate bonds, it is a “crazy quilt” of unlinked electronic bidding systems and smaller dealers, he says. What may no longer exist are enough heavyweights with spare appetite to buy risk from many sellers.
The article then goes on the *speculate* that maybe regulation forcing everyone to use a large central exchange would help liquidity, or perhaps there should be a way of linking the small exchanges and brokers that exist already. Either way the author feels something should be done.
[The a final point: "[...] before the market splinters into a cluttered rabble of Bitbonds" is a terrible analogy, sort-of implying that it will become too fragmented, or perhaps replaced by some new-age unfathomable thing. On a technical level it makes no sense and demonstrates a very shallow understanding of bitcoins]
@_date: 2013-10-09 09:10:30
I hate to put a dampener on things - not least since I like the idea of colored coins as much as everyone else - but colored coins are only a partial solution. You're still left with many problems:
**Safe exchange**: So your colored coins represent the stocks, but how to you actually buy and sell with another party safely? This can be done on the blockchain in principle but you need to make sure that one party can't keep a partially signed transaction and then release it after a price movement. It's not trivial.
**Price discovery**: You can't rely on the blockchain for this since a malicious user could generate fake trades with himself to distort the market.
**Underwriting**: Bitcoin stocks are risky at the best of times. How can you verify that the issuer is who he says he is? Will anyone check for scams? The bitcoin exchanges took steps to facilitate this.
**Regulatory compliance**: If bitcoin stocks are to go mainstream they will have to comply with financial regulations. Decentralisation is a double-edged sword here since it effectively means these investments (and hence the issuers) can never go mainstream. This might put off a lot of legitimate businesses from issuing coloured coins.
Even with coloured coins in existance you're still going to have to solve some of these problems - do you have a plan for that?

It's kinda like asking "How can I accept credit cards if I only have a traditional cash register?". Simple answer: You can't, you need a credit card machine. Same with bitcoins - you need a bitcoin machine. 
For small amounts of transactions the simplest thing to do is buy a cheap android phone and use that. If you're going to be handling larger volumes then you can build one out of tablets or rasberry PIs or other cheap hardware. (In principle you could alter your existing credit card machine to handle bitcoins but that's really only an option for dedicated hardware hackers).
Alas there's no consumer-grade solution, but really android is pretty close. If you have an interesting problem the community might be willing to help you out a little. Never hurts to go into your specific needs more.

Right. Well I agree that what is currently considered public-sector would look *very* different in a "no-tax" world that you refer to, and I'm not going to speculate how it might look.
However it's pretty well understood how private companies respond to tax, and regulation [basically tax], and subsidies [basically a negative tax].  You end up with more (or less depending on which way you go) of the same stuff - and oftentimes you just end up with the same stuff but fatter shareholders ;)
To say that the private road sector would look vastly different if taxes and regulation were less (as opposed to only slightly different, which is my point) is an extraodinary claim and so requires extraordinary evidence to back it up.

They don't need to be on the blockchain to be provably fair. The general plan is:
if( hash( *something-you-have* + *satoshi-dice-secret*) % 100 &gt; win chance ) then *you-win* else *you-lose*
	
You're free to provide whatever you like as *something-you-have* each time you play. Satoshi dice pick a new *satoshi-dice-secret* each day, they release the hash of the secret upfront and after the day is done they publish the full secret. Plenty of bitcoin casinos operate this way. However using the hash of your transaction on the blockchain is a little bit simpler.

Well bank transfers are not cash deposits ;). I think if someone wanted 10k of bitcoins for cash you'd be right to ask questions! If you're just handling small amounts that add up to a large amount then you're no different to any other cash-in-hand business. Banks deal with these all the time. If you tell the bank it's a personal account and then deposit loads of cash you will have a hard time, but if you act like you're a small business you should be ok.
Ultimately nobody knows where the radar is. It's going to depend on which jurisdiction you live in, and even on which bank you use.

First things first. By definition a pyramid scheme is one where you get rewarded directly for enrolling people. Clearly this is not the case for bitcoin. 
What you're referring to is a Speculative Bubble. This is a phenominon that can happen to many assets (Shares, Gold, Bonds, Currencies, Tulips...) and of course people can win and lose fortunes along the way. Whilst the bubble can be a scam most people agree that the underlying asset isn't necessarily so.  Clearly bitcoin is at risk of such bubbles.
So the question is: Is the current bitcoin price part of a bubble? You'll find many voices who say bitcoin is the future, and many who say it's a passing fad. In truth nobody knows. All we can do is look at the situation and make a guess.

You're right, but for the wrong reasons. For starters you can just bribe one employee to steal a database. Corporate IT systems are far more locked down than that.

In order to be secure you need a function that is hard to calculate but is easy to verify. The function chosen is a reverse-hash which is a cryptographic gold standard when you're trying to find something with these properties. Most real-world problems aren't like this. Typical distributed computing problems (SETI Folding ...) are hard to verify as well as hard to calculate.
If you could find a real-world application that was both hard to calculate and easy to verify then you could potentially build a coin based off the back of that.

Bitcoin is already covered by tax law and always has been.
I'm not sure where you're going with this, has pretty much nailed the point. You must declare any bitcoin profits to the tax man (yes, even though it's not entirely obvious how to do this).

The main thing is to check that the inputs are confirmed.
A lot depends on the context of what you're doing. Are your customers known to you? Do you already have their ID anyway? (photo? phone number?). Are the transactions small? Can your product be revoked? Factors like this mitigate your risk.

The "without regulations" is a bit of a myth. Bitcoin is already subject to many regulations, just like any other asset (typically to do with capital gains). The problem is enforcing them. Just like preventing piracy has been very difficult to enforce in practice, so would prohibiting the trade in bitcoins.
In reality most businesses are willing to co-operate with goverments and establish a firm legal basis for their operations - for obvious reasons. Equally as long as governments can collect tax and prevent money laundering I don't think governments would want to fight bitcoin.

That's a good write up. One thing I don't quite follow though:


You cite consumer electronics as a counterexample, which is fine. You then extend this to willingness to borrow:


The thing is there is a market for consumer electronics, competing providers can sell at whatever price they see fit. Consumers can choose to buy or not. Economically this might be seen as a dead loss, but if it makes people happy it's rational to pay for it just like it's rational to pay for a cinema ticket or anything else consumable. However this doesn't follow for loans...
In an inflationary environment a lender would set interest to provide for the service / risk of lending money. The varying rates of interest make a market for loans which is free to find the right level based on how much spare cash / potential services there are in the system.
In a deflationary environment this can't happen since why would a lender lend at a negative interest rate? There can't be a market for lending money and so no borrowing takes place (or very little).
Perhaps I'm missing something but I can't see how a functional lending market can work in a deflationary environment?

A top range quad core CPU hashing at 100% can maybe do 10 MHash/second = 0.01 GHash/second. The difficulty is 800000 GHash/second. So to even get 50% of the hashrate you'd need 40 million nodes. It's hard to know how many nodes exactly there are but it's nowhere near this many, 5-10k is a more likely amount, and they won't be running on quad core processors.
**TL;DR** Even if all nodes were miners it barely be a drop in the ocean in terms of hashing power.
**Edit** Fixed the maths based on everyone running quad-core not 48-core. Now it's even worse.

In the short term as the price of bitcoin goes up the fees will go down to keep it at around 1 cent. In the long term the market decides the fees, and so it's hard to predict. 
Actually the fee is tied to a related discussion about the blockchain size. Basically the block size is currently limited to 1 Mb, which limits the number of transactions in a block. If this limit remains but the number of transactions increaes then only the transactions with the highest fees would ever get included - in this scenario one could imagine normal users using a bitcoin bank, where transactions are done off-chain and only inter-bank transactions ever make it onto the block chain. An alternative scenario is that the block size limit increaes and so the fees remain as they are, but this requires a hard fork.

The 50% stats linked are blocks mined in the last 24 hours. BTC Guild have been lucky over the last day. In reality their share is lower.
Having said that I'm not sure what's to stop a malicious pool operator in future from offering generous payments in order to perform a 'cheap' 51% attack. I guess the theory is that this would undermine confidence in bitcoin and miners would thus avoid it. There's a tragedy-of-the-commons style problem here though.

I think a few people have tried the idea of poker-style tournaments with games. Bitcoin would be a great currency for this. 
However I don't think the format has ever caught on. I suspect that people who are this competitive about their gaming would only play a 'pro' game, so it will only work if some big A-List game gets into it. I doubt any major publisher wants to go near the agro and shit that would go with this format, so the only remaining niche is privately organised pro tournaments on A-List games. Since they can't do any serious anti-cheat policing the format doesn't scale beyond LAN style events for the most elite teams.

In order to perform attacks as described in the paper, BTC Guild would have to be building an alternative blockchain in private. Once the private chain was longer than the public chain they would release it, claiming a double spend.
*EVERYONE would see this attack*. Sure the attack would be successful but I doubt it could be done more than once before the pool was abandoned by the community. [It would also have a devastating economic impact, but let's not digress].
Furthermore if the attack fails, the attacker will forgo the block reward. Currently it's only 50% likely to be successful with 6 confirms, so there's a 50% chance of losing 6*25 = $21k of reward. So the spend would have to be &gt;&gt; $10k to be worth performing this attack.
**TL;DR**: Everyone would see this attack happening, and If your transaction is small (&lt;$5k) it's not worth doing.

The theory is that CoinValidation is a database of addresses-&gt;owners, so if you ensure addresses are never reused you can't construct such a database.

Escrow is not a good model for contracts and warantees (if your car breaks after you use it for a week, escrow won't help). Also those 3rd parties are going to charge for their services eventually.

It's certainly broadly true, even if some specific claims may not be. Most of the bitcoin wealth is held by few people. This is a side effect of how bitcoin is setup, and its history. 
Inflation (for all its sins) is a form of wealth redistribution. Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, and so there's no natural mechanism to redistribute wealth.

Unpublished research should always be taken with a grain of salt.

Yes it's a weakness but not game changing.

Two reaons, both are somewhat technical:
Firstly, whenever you spend any bitcoins you need to spend all of inputs. Say I have 10 BTC in my wallet and I want to give you 2, then the transaction will say "Take the 10 BTC from bitcoind3, give 2 to TheSelfGovernd and give 8 to bitcoind3". Some wallet software will be a bit lax about where they send the change. This can go wrong if your software has two address (one on your computer and one corresponding to your paper wallet). It's quite easy to check to make sure everything went smoothly but it's a subtle point and easily forgotten.
Secondly paranoia. The reason why you carefully made your paper wallet in the first place (making sure you booted to a clean linux instalation and your computer was offline), was to avoid the risk from hackers / trojans / etc. The moment you put enter your wallet's private key into an online computer you are exposed to those risks once more. The only way to make sure your paper wallet is safe again is to start from scratch and make a new one.
Of course it *is* possible to reuse a paper wallet, as long as you understand the risks. However I wouldn't recommend it. I suggest that whenever you make paper wallets you create a few spare ones so that you can empty one wallet and move your coins into a fresh one each time you need to spend some of your savings.

@_date: 2013-06-13 17:26:09
Let's consider a typical transaction that you might want to make anonymous:
[MtGox] -&gt; [You] -&gt; [Silk Road]
Your account on MtGox is registered to you personally, so the moment you receive coins your address is known to MtGox and in principle is no longer anonymous. However you could easily generate a new address and bounce the coins through a temproary address (taking care to delete it afterwards) like so:
[MtGox] -&gt; [You] -&gt; [You (secret)] -&gt; [Silk Road]
Let's say MtGox and the SilkRoad get compromised and someone comes knocking you can plausibly plead "Yes, I bought bitcoins from MtGox, but I gave them to a guy I met online, if he chose to use the Silk Road that's not my business".
Now what happens next depends on who is asking. From a legal perspective you've probably covered these tracks (NB: IANAL). From a tax perspective they would probably expect some proof of payment for large transactions. Worst case: If the guy knocking is a mafia thug (let's say you pissed off some dealer) they won't care about your 'story' and will hit you anyway.
So a lot of it depends on what level of anonimity you're looking for? If you're looking for plausible deniability then bitcoin easilly provides it. If you want the completely untracable anonymitiy then that's *much* harder to achieve.
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:52:01
First names, well there's maybe ~100 of those, 6 family members, 10 separator characters. That's 7 bits + 3 bits + 4 bits = 15 bits of entropy. Double it for good measure (case strategies, perhaps you threw in a symbol or two at the end). 30 bits of entropy, 2^30 ~= 1 billion possibilities. Note that this is *vastly* reduced if I know your family's names (perhaps I have your sister as a friend on facebook?).
A few fast GPUs could churn through a million a second, so you're looking at a few hours work for a determined hacker.

Forget about mining, it's a technical detail.
Go to blockchain.info, create an account. Congratulations you now have a bitcoin address - you're good to go.
Now you just need to get some bitcoins sent to that address. The easiest way is to buy them with normal money - but the details of doing that depend on where you live. If you live in a city then localbitcoins.com is a good place to start.

Well dollars are no longer pegged to an amount of gold, and only the Federal Reserve can issue dollars. All the other banks can only issue "IOU Dollars" (aka commercial paper or corporate debt). The money supply does inflate, but equally nobody is stupid enough to think that these IOUs are as good as the real dollars, so the price is adjusted accordingly - depending on who exactly is issuing the IOU.
So back to bitcoin: The real bitcoin in your wallet is the baseline. It MtGox owes you bitcoin, well it's not as good as the real thing but its not far off. Let's hypothesize that some banks do get bitcoin depositors (because they don't wish to do the key management themselves or whatever), these banks could start to issue bitcoin IOUs. I doubt anyone would think they were as good as real bitcoins, but equally they do have some value depending on the issuer. If this happens on a large enough scale then such bitcoin banks could use fractional reserve and inflate the money supply. 
Economically the same system functions exactly the same as it does today.

Kinda. The block looks like this:
    Pay 25 BTC to xxx
    &lt;Many other transactions&gt;
    Nonce
You pick the nonce, take all this, hash it, and hope the resulting hash is small. If it's small then the pool operator will accept it as proof of work. If it's *very* small, then it's a valid block and everyone will accept it as proof of work.
If you change the address xxx to be your address, then the pool owner won't accept any nonce as proof of work (even if the resulting hash is small). However if it happens to be very small then it's still a valid block and everyone will accept it - this is solo mining.
@_date: 2013-01-30 23:54:36
Currently lenders don't 'advertise' rates. Borrowers ask lenders what their rate is. Lenders can choose (for good or bad reasons) to give you one rate and to give another guy a different rate. In principle a market should cope with this, but in practice markets have inertia. The only reference you have is LIBOR, which is crooked anyway. If you don't even realise you're being given a worse rate than another guy then it might never occur to you to shop elsewhere for a better rate!*
The obvious way out is to either provide more lenders (difficult in the current climate since people are generally unwilling to loan), or to force lenders to be more transparent about pricing - perhaps by getting them to publish the price of every done deal. AKA more regulation.
*This is overly negative. Perhaps you're being given a bad rate because you are a genuine credit risk. Even so, lenders should explain the situation to you so that you can either lump it and pay the premium, or improve your business so you are no longer such a credit risk.

I like bitcoin as much as anyone here, but linking an misinformed internet chat on a sensationalist article doesn't do anyone any favors!
Just think about this for a moment. LIBOR is the rate at which banks lend money to each other (i.e. I pay you £100 now and in 3 months you pay me £100+x). For a bunch of historical reasons which I won't get into it's set by committee and, surprise surprise, it's not very transparent (to put it charitably).
So let's move to bitcoin. If you lend me 100 BTC what's a fair amount of BTC for me to pay you in 3 months time? Well to be honest nobody knows, there's no market for that sort of transaction, and frankly the bitcoin community isn't entirely sure how to conduct such loans in a even remotely safe manner yet.
The traditional banking system is miles ahead here. I'm not saying it's perfect, and no doubt bitcoin's day will come eventually. But this isn't a strength of bitcoin just yet.
...I guess we could start by forming a committee to set the BTC lending rate... :)

Each address has a public key and a private key. However there's no reason for the private key to be stored on a computer. It could be kept on a piece of paper until you need to spend the coins on that address.


The teminology is unfortunate, think of miners as bitcoin accountants. When coins are moved from one address to another these guys verify that the transactions are legititmate and update the ledger accordingly. They get a small insentive for their work since it requires solving lots of mathematical equations (which in turn consumes power).

Sure - today.
But if the reward for mining becomes much smaller that figure will go down. In ~10 years time will the numbers be so secure? I'm not certain.
Also this scenario is pulled off by a bunch of guys who have already invested heavily in mining hardware, and no doubt made a good return from it. So the cost of attack is the extra investment, not the total investment.

It's not that the market isn't 'free'. It's just hard to know what a fair price is. Calculating the fair price from fundamentals is *fiendishly* tricky as I tried to illustrate. You can ask people for a price but they are likely to say LIBOR+x which is fine if LIBOR is fair. There's nothing to stop someone lending for MYBOR+x but the problem is they wouldn't find any customers (it's like trying to sell Bitcoins for Icelandic Krona, there's currently no market, it's much easier just to sell for Euros and then pay for FX).
What the market needs is more transparency - cash loans need to be standardised so that you avoid the fiendish collateral problems, and people should be forced to report what rate they paid for a loan. That way you can forget the LIBOR+x and just see what someone paid a few moments ago then ask for the same rate or better. Ironically this requires *more* regulation in the market not less.

A better question is: what do you know that the market doesn't that means you can do better than the market?
Most people who daytrade for a living don't think "I'll buy a bit now, then I'll sell a bit...", they have clients who, say, want to buy 1000s but want someone to spread the order into little chunks so it doesn't move the market.
However a practice account is a good way to convince yourself that daytrading is not for you :p

You need to think through what 2-factor-authentication means exactly. Bitcoin are generally held by one private key. This key has to be stored somewhere. The basic problem is that anyone who can access your device could copy the key and steal your money.
So the next logical step is to encrypt it. This helps because (assuming you do it properly) the attacker now needs both the encrypted data and the password.
So what does two factor authentication bring to the party?  The problem is that it's too easy to capture / guess people's passwrods. 2FA prevents access to the encrypted data. The thing is, the way 2FA works is not very cryptographic. You actually need a 3rd party to enforce the 2FA system. This is something blockchain.info and MtGox do for you.
One key problem is that, unlike a password, if the system hosting the 2FA gets compromised, the 2FA is useless. As such there's no point in having 2FA for a wallet on your phone / PC. It would be of no value if your device is hacked. The best you can hope for is that the attacker doesn't guess your password.
Actually phones do have a form of 2FA - notably a pin code to unlock your screen. You should definitely have this set up!

Bitcoin escrow has been talked about for ages. But how would you actually generate the transactions?
Ideally you'd generate them entirely client side, but let's be realistic here, these things are tricky to generate. You need to specify 3 bitcoin addresses, with the correct amount, and somehoe attach order details. The average user would struggle to generate it correctly - heck very few bitcoin clients are even capable of generating such transactions.
The other option would be to pass the coins through a hosted wallet and generate them for the user. Unfortunately you still have the risk that the hosted site is siezed and sicne it has at least the buyer's private key some funds would be at risk.
The only hope is that the bitcoin payment protocol supports these sorts of transactions.

I feel you're misguided on this one. There's a good reason why young children don't generally look after their own money. They tend not to be great at looking after it!
Obviously children need to be taught about money, and bitcoin could be part of that. However money will always be an adult concept, there is no "child-friendly" way of handling it. Either a child is mature enough to use the same bitcoin wallets you or I use, or they are too young to look after thier own money. It's as simple as that.

Coinbase and bitpay are the main players in this arena. They both have reasonable reputations - though like any online business you will find gripe threads from time to time. For what it's worth I buy the humblebundle with bitcoin via coinbase all the time and it's never any hassle.

If you read the coinbase T&amp;Cs it will cover this scenario somewhere, however people don't generally overpay so I wouldn't worry about it!

Here's the ELI5 answer: The standard fee is 0.0005 BTC which is roughly equivalent to 5 US cents.
You can pay less (even 0) but it means your transaction will take longer to process, or possibly not get processed at all. If your transaction is really important you can pay more, this will increase the chance that your transaction gets included in the blockchain as soon as possible.
There are some other special cases: If your transaction is for a large number of aged BTC (i.e. coins you've not spent recently) then you don't have to pay a fee, though many would say it's a good idea. If your transaction is large in byte terms (e.g. you pay lots of people in one transaction) then you'll have to pay a bigger fee. However the general standard-fee=0.0005 BTC is a good guide.

@_date: 2013-03-27 23:24:20
Technically you're right, and yet you've taken away the wrong message.
Yes a bunch of banks publish an average gold price in the same way a the do for cash interest rates (aka LIBOR).
Does this mean gold is worthless? Hell no! Nobody is forced to do any deals at this rate, and there is so much demand for gold at a high price, that even if the rate was off by a small amount it wouldn't affect the fundamentals.
The same is true for Libor. Yes it was fixed which made some people a lot of money (unfairly). However fundamentally nobody is forced to trade at LIBOR, the fixing didn't significantly change the fair rate of lending cash.
@_date: 2013-03-07 13:10:31
It's just supply and demand. If miners can only put 10000 transactions in each block they will pick the 10000 with the best fees. If you don't want to pay a fee then you'll have to wait for a quiet block of a generous miner. Neither of which are guaranteed.
If bitcoin reaches this state then the ecosystem is evidently healthy enough that it doesn't need to seduce new users with free transactions.

Technically nothing. But it would be *very* expensive.


This doesn't follow.
There are two points that newbies tend to miss when they think about this argument:
* Bitcoins can be divided up almost infinitely. 
* As you buy bitcoins, the price of the remaining bitcoins will go up (supply and demand).
Hypothetically if there was only 1 bitcoin available to the market it wouldn't matter. We could divide that up into billions of tiny pieces and use these bitcoin fractions for our day to day purposes.
Economically it would be very difficult to get to that situation since as the bitoins were purchaed the price of the other bitcoins would increase, no doubt to astronomic levels.

Perhaps. All these arguements could be outlined in the FAQ.

Well the obvious answer is not to keep all your savings in just one account.

Depends on which client / website you use. Most wallets either hold your coins for you so it's no concern where the coins are sent from, or they will send it back to the originating address. Blockchain.info gives you specific control of this in the advacned options panel if you care for it.

If you place a buy limit order and don't have enough funds, MtGox will reduce the amount of bitcoins you receive to match the funds available.

A lot of people here like to be masters of their own destiny when it comes to bitcoins. I find this approach a little odd since I bet they keep their fiat in the bank.
Nevertheless they have a point. If MtGox holds your coins then your coins will be lost if MtGox steal the money, or get hacked, or claim to be hacked, or whatever. Perhaps this is an unlikely scenario, perhaps it's not - who knows?

Right - so all fiat money is IOU money, of course. **But** only the central bank can create new fiat dollars.
If you're saying MyBank PLC can create fiat dollars, that is *incorrect*. They can only create 'IOU fiat' credit notes. The balance in your account is a form of 'IOU fiat', so the bank can arbitrarily increase this if it wants without needing real dollars - just like you say. 
However when you instruct your bank to pay another institution, that institution (be it an individual or another bank or whatever) can demand real fiat dollars.
The thing is other banks will accept the 'IOU fiat' notes from MyBank PLC as though they are nearly as good as dollars. Since most financial transactions are between banks, no fiat needs to change hands necessarily. Hence the inflation of money supply through issuance of corporate debt.
[Note that banks aren't stupid, when banks pay each other with 'IOU fiat' notes, they demand a premium for them over real dollars!]
*So back to bitcoins...* All these mechanisms work fine in the bitcoin world - except the central bank of course. Bitcoin banks can issue 'IOU bitcoin', both in the form of a balance in their online wallet (aka a bank account) and corporate debt to trade to other people. Other bitcoin banks may choose to honour these 'IOU bitcoin' notes just like real bitcoins.

Even more important than the mechanics of the loan is the publishing of the price we agreed, so that others in the market can see what the rate is! That's the problem with the classic market - there's great systems for getting the mechanics of the loans right, but there's no way to discover what the fair price is. That's why LIBOR was invented.
And how do you secure the loan? Big banks post collateral to each other (i.e. lend each other government bonds or gold, so that if the borrower defaults the lender gets to keep the asset). There's no bitcoin equivalent of this yet.
Now if we have a system for cryptographically secure collateral deposits, and a price discovery mechanism - *then* we'd have something to replace LIBOR. It's all doable, and the time will come I'm sure, but it's still some way off. There are bigger hurdles to overcome first.

First question: Do you really need multithreaded access? If your app isn't performance critical you could probably just put a lock around it and be done.
Since blocks are read-only multithreading shouldn't be a major problem. The only thing that needs locking is the index of blocks, for which an atomic integer would probably be ok.

I've considered the idea of using bitcoin addresses as keys for messaging. The main attraction is that a bitcoin address is much neater than those ugly PGP keys you see. 
However there's a few technical hurdles, the one that bothers me the most is sending messages to multiple people. PGP has a clever trick for this, wheras bitcoin messages do not. The other is how do you know that a message is intended for you? PGP includes key fingerprints so you can see that a message is intended for you before you decrypt it, however this compromises anonymity. The alternative is to run all encrypted messages past all your keys and see if they decode, which is pretty ugly.

Simple - **because equities and cash (which includes fiat deposits in the bank, and government bonds and the like) offer better returns**.
This is in purely economic terms. Every asset has risks, and as long as markets are reasonably transparent - which by and large they are - you expect rational investors to put their money into whatever asset class they believe offers the best return for the risk.
The markets (generally) choose cash and equities over gold and bitcoin. So it's foolish to ask "Why is the market wrong?", the wise economist will ask "am I miss-valuing bitcoins?". 
Most people conclude the market is correct - bitcoin is a decent investment that has the potential of greatness if you're looking for high-risk / high-return, but by no means a guaranteed way to make money.
So I'll return the question: Why do you think differently?

No no, that's not the point. The intrinsic value of an item is basically how much utility it can give if you can't trade it. A book could entertain or inform you. You could make gold into pretty jewelery. If you had a cow, it could feed you for a month or two.
A bitcoin is completely useless to you if you can't trade it. As is a dollar note of course.

According to the brief, trojan software could get root access to your phone. Here's a Digest:
* Tojan software could take the form of an app on the Play store that claims to only have permissions X but actually has more privalidges.
* There are other potential vectors too, e.g. software updates, but it's hard to see how these would be delivered.
* The implication is that these apps could get access to areas that are apps are usually forbiden (e.g. other apps' data).
* Full details of the hack are being made public at a BlackHat conference on the 27th July (Make of this what you will).
In bitcoin terms the risks are any coins you have access to on your phone. Plus it makes two-factor-authentication via google authenticator easier to bypass. A compromised phone would have access to those private keys, and to your two-factor-authentication tokens.
If you're paranoid the simplest thing to do is to disable update from the play store and don't accept any OS upgrades until after this is patched. On my phone go to the play store -&gt; settings -&gt; auto-update Apps -&gt; do not autoupdate. If you're *really* paranoid then you must assume this hack is public knowledge and your phone is compromised already.

There's really no point in exporting the keys out of blockchain.info, just send the coins.

It's not been peer reviewed. Cryptography is very difficult to get right - many [many ciphers have been broken or shown to have weaknesses]( Without some serious peer review there is every chance that zerocoin is not as anonymous as it proports to be.

I am only considering supply you're right. The market has also shrunk since it's peak a few months ago - that's one of the reasons why the price has dropped considerably. ;)
Imagine a futre where the size of the bitcoin market is stable (possible? sure. Likely? hard to say) - in this world a bitcoin bank could lend out money at interest.
However on the whole I agree with you - It's unlikely that bitcoin will be stable enough for investment lending anytime soon. But it is possible that bitcoin investments may become feasable at some point in the future. The economics are against it, but they don't rule it out.

Sure give it a go. However don't be under any impression that this is an easy job. Expect to spend a lot of time teaching people how bitcoin works. There will be painful silences waiting 30+ minutes for confirmations. If you fix the price you will have people cancel on you last minute leaving you out of pocket. If you don't you'll have awkward and nasty conversations about why the price has gone up from when you last spoke.
Pro tip: the job becomes a whole load more interesting / fun / exciting / dangerous / lucrative if you buy and sell.
One last idea. Trading Bitcoins is probably never going to earn you much. However starting an on campus pro bitcoin movement, getting all the shops and bars to accept bitcoin etc would be a great project and potentially could earn you 1% fees on the side if you sell your services smartly.

A ponzi scheme is a zero sum game. In a ponzi scheme, early adopters can only profit at the expense of late adopters, and the late adopters always lose. Bitcoin has an expected win-win outcome. Early and present adopters profit from the rise in value as Bitcoins become better understood and in turn demanded by the public at large. All adopters benefit from the usefulness of a reliable and widely-accepted decentralized peer-to-peer currency.
Don't mix things up though - the current price rises are almost entirely due to speculation / increased interest in bitcoin. The anti-inflationary nature of the currency is barely noticable.

Next year, thanks to predictable deflation, it should be worth $105 [let's assume a stable market].
However a promising startup would like to borrow $100 cash, and promises to pay back $110 next year.
I could either A) hold my bitcoin, or B) sell the bitcoin, get $100, give it to the startup. Now B has risks, but still because of the numbers involved there is an incentive to lend. Assuming I can guarantee B's creditworthyness, I would be better off lending.

ASICMiner is a private company that owns mining hardware. You can buy shares in them etc.
Until recently they were mining as part of a pool. Now they are mining as an independent entity.
This matters not-one-jot, except to shareholders. Shareholders might prefer the more reliable profits from pooled mining, or the slightly higher margins from solo mining. I'm not a shareholder so I don't really care ;)
I guess it's worth noting that some of the pools have been edging close to 50% of the network hashing power. Having a few less large entities like this not part of these pools will even things out a little.

I don't think you need to encourage hedge funds / ETFs to find bitcoin, (or equally try and scare them away). If they believe it is profitable they will come to bitcoin, whether you like it or not.
So why aren't they here? I think it comes down to two things:
* High volatility in the market - the bitcoin price is very unstable still.
* Low market capacity - sure $500 Million might sound like a lot, but in the hedgefund space this is pocket change.
Incidentally what the market needs more it bitcoin futures [pay me $ now and I promise you BTC in the future]. If someone were to offer these to the market it would do wonders for the economy. Miners might be a good position to offer these.

Operating *any* rig will make an income. This much is true.
However the income it generates could be less than the cost of electricity. Nobody really has free electricity (even if you own your own solar farm it will cost you money to clean the solar panels etc) so you might end up operating at a loss. Your profits also need to repay your capital costs, which could be significant, and over time will include repairs / replacements.
**TL;DR** Yes you'll always make a bit of money, but no it won't always cover your electricity or capital costs.

You're worried about price drops right?
In this case you don't actually have to withdraw your dollars from MtGox, you just need to sell it as dollars. After the price drops once things have stabalised again you can just buy back more bitcoins from MtGox and then sell them on localbitcoins.com (or whatever).
If you're worried about MtGox vanishing with all your funds then you could put your funds into bitstamp, or btc-e, or even bridgewalker. But however you do it you'd have to trust *someone* with your funds if you wan to be able to hedge quickly.

A [green address]( is an address that's owned by a trusted third party - e.g. MtGox. You know any funds sent from this address are good because you trust MtGox not to do a double spend attack on you.

Great questions.
My understanding is that all these numbers were more or less set in stone when Satoshi first came up with bitcoin. My guess is for the difficulty adjust / halving events he figured the discrete nature wouldn't matter much. As for the 10 minutes / 4 year absolute levels, I think these were just sane guestimates.
The discrete nature of events is a small problem. Yes continuous would be better, but it wouldn't make that much difference.
With hindsight it seems fairly clear that 10 minutes was a mistake and it's just too long for no good reason. 2 minutes or less would be better, just to work more comfortably with human timescales.
The big one is the coin minting rate. Right now 50% of coins have been minted. If this is too fast it starts to look like a scam. If it's too slow then it's hard for bitcoins to gain initial value. It's far too soon to say if Satoshi got this right or not (and thus one of the biggest long-term risks to bitcoin as a whole). Time will tell!

Most markets have rules against artificial manipulation and insider trading. You can argue about how effective they are, but when they work they help the markets run more efficiently.
Bitcoin markets have no such protection and so on some levels they are less efficient.

Agreed - however although SR can only affect the tail end of the supply chain, every little bit helps.

Bitcoins aren't 'held' in wallets the way you think. Really Bitcoins are held in a ledger, that says something like this:
* Public address: 1aaaaaaa... has 1337 bitcoins
* Public address: 1abcdefg... has 1.55 bitcoins
* Public address: 13fhsb34... has 53.2 bitcoins
* Public address: 1zzzzzzz... has 0.2333 bitcoins
Everyone shares the ledger, and in order to move coins from one address to another you need the private key corresponding to the public address. So you can put coins into any address whatsoever, but to take them out you need the private key.
[As a side note: You can't just type in any random letters and expect it to work, there are rules to make a valid address. This is reassuring since it means you can't accidentally mistype a character or two. However if you *really* wanted you could write a computer program to generate valid public addresses without a corresponding private key, and you could send bitcoins to these addresses. These coins would be lost from the system forever].

Go to  and have a play, you can see it in action.
The first rule of brain wallets is **do not pick a password yourself**. Anything you generate in your head is not random, and therefore not safe. The only safe way to use a brain wallet is if you get a computer to generate the password and then you remember it.

Sell at $120 (yes I'm calling the peak here).
No reason - I'm feeling lucky.

This is not as good as it sounds. 
Firstly there aren't *that* many substrings, It would only take an attacker a couple of hours to try them all. 
Secondly a keylogger can easily grab clipboard, mouse clicks, screenshots, etc.

Offline mode + bitaddress.org is pretty safe.
Blockchain.info can decrypt (not sure if it works offline). Some of the desktop clients can probably do it too.
