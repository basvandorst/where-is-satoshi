Agree entirely, but Karpeles has a drawn a big target on his back with this. Kinda surprised whoever is investigating Gox hasn't scooped him up and put him in protective custody yet.

As I (vaguely) understand it the problem is something like you need to sign a message containing a hash *with the hash it contains* to do it at a protocol level.
Needless to say, this is a nontrivial problem to solve.

People that walk away with lots of other people's money can't really expect safety, either.

I can think it's unethical and still play in a market other people are doing it in. Doesn't affect my ethics, just my risk.

Is in every license, even commercial ones. Due diligence in production is entirely on the user; if you want support, you buy a contract. If no one offers a support contract, you hire peeps and deal with it.
Such is life.

The bank transfer stuff is weird and verification is way too much work for a casual such as myself, but the obvious security effort, transparency, and community engagement at VoS is brilliant. 
VoS is my recommendation when someone asks about buying crypto, keep it up!

Every forked altcoin is a chance to hit the right combo for mainstream blockchain success, and the technology itself is all that's needed to change the world. Most of the technology is from bitcoin, so the APIs and integrations are almost identical; if you take one coin, it's not hard to take any of them with the same backend.
Bell Labs made UNIX, but Linux made UNIX mainstream. I'm a favoring doge for the breakout, but I'm hardly confident even it will end up the Linux of blockchain currency implementations.

I disagree, already there are technologies in altcoins that are laying the foundation for what's coming, in the same way bitcoin laid the foundation for the altcoins.
Blockchain-based storage is on the horizon, and I'm hoping someone comes up with a way to mine and verify transactions with *useful computation* next. This stuff is less a replacement for currency and more a replacement for organizations. It opens up the possibility of large scale, distributed, fault-tolerant, and most importantly *self-supporting* computational services.
Imagine if The Pirate Bay was a hosted on a distributed application platform, using distributed storage resources, identified with NameCoin DNS, and people mined PirateCoin by storing, transporting, or processing data to support the site.
No one can stop it short of disrupting the internet at a fundamental level; if you do your release right there's no org or person to sue, and too many peers operating it to effectively prosecute.
I really think this is more what Satoshi was aiming at from the start, he/it just wrapped it up in a get-rich-quick scheme to get people interested and spawn a dev community. =)

Blockchain is the new HTTP, this thing is going to be everywhere.

So we can decouple computation services from human organizations, allowing services to exist independent of corporations or governments.
Cloud without the cloud vendor, distributed services that pay for themselves and are nearly impossible to stop or shut down once they reach a certain size.

It's the most inviting and least intimidating coin, and has attracted a large *new* userbase full of people that are neither cypherpunks or speculators, they're end users that find value in microtransactions.
This could change in a week, like anything about crypto, but right now the Doge is very interesting.

It's mostly that it requires sending/recieving/dealing with checks and in-person bank transfers to use it. Too much really really not fun banking work for a fun hobby. I'm just not moving enough coin in (and none out) to make it worth the effort yet.
Coinbase was really easy because I'm never going to hit their transaction limit, so the lowest-tier verification was fine for my purposes and done with a simple checking account bind. ~$1k/week of crypto is far more than I plan on buying in the near future. Sucks I have to wait days for an ACH to go through to get anything, but at least I can buy at a spot price with an ACH transfer and don't have to touch checks or go to the bank.

Start thinking of Bitcoin as just the first POC for *millions* of future blockchain based apps. The underlying datastructure is the world-changing magic.

I've been out of btc since around $950, Gox has been an obvious timebomb since it picked up the +100$ differential over all the other exchanges. You can't have an arbitrage opportunity like that last for *months* unless something is shady.

They're evolving it. Most won't be successful in the long run but they *will* generate new ideas, new approaches and new userbases [wow such users etc]. Nothing of use is lost when a coin fails, the innovation and code hang around to be reused. (Speculators' shirts are of no use!)
I suppose if all you want is a digital simulation of gold, for all the good and bad that comes with that, bitcoin is perfect.


Proof-of-stake seems like a reasonable steppingstone towards more useful work functions, although I'm not cypherpunk enough to really grok it.
A lot of people assumed trustless distributed ledgers weren't feasible either, until someone did it.

Eh, if it's done well it'll guarantee all the server side hashes are based on derived (stretched) keys rather than raw (shitty) passwords. 
Does it buy you substantially more than just using bcrypt or scrypt on the server side? Probably not.
