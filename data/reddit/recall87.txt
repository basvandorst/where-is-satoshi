I don’t believe this to be true. I’ve read somewhere on this sub that lump sum had better returns like 80% of the time.
Dca works if you have ‘little’ money to spend.

I understand what it sounds like. But this is only for storing my seeds in different locations. I have stored the complete seeds in the traditional ways (hardware wallet) as wel :)
Thx for the heads up though! 
Edit: and thx for the tip ;)

I guess your mom likes elephants? ;)

Haha, no it did not. But I'll stop now to not give 'it' any ideas :P

Just out of curiosity, can I just tip you to? Does the fact that you tip me create a wallet or how does it work?

Bitcoin killed my father and raped my mother!

Do you have a source from where you found this information? Thx

They do look nice though..

Don’t keep your bitcoin on exchanges! Buy it, store it (paper wallet, trezor/ hardware wallet) and preferably on multiple locations.
Edit: did the paper wallet in a pretty cool construct.  ‘Cut up’ the keys and divide them on 3 paperwallets. Combined, 2 out of 3 will form the seed but no single peace of paper has the complete seeds. Cost me a bit of work but nice to do for extra safety.

But regulation makes them hide it better ;)

Well, an easy goal would be to own 2.1 btc. This would mean that there can only be (at max) 10 million people who own just as much as you  ;)

Agreed. And even the intrinsic value of food (and water) is even relative. If you are not hungry or thirsty is has way les ‘value’ then when you are starving and dehydrated.

Made me laugh, upvote earned!

You could buy 0,1 bitcoin yourself and make it so only a max of 10mm people can have the same amount as you.
No advice, just planting a seed ^^
