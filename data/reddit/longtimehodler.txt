I hope it does not go back down to 6k again, and that this is the new low. One can only hope.
@_date: 2018-09-01 12:10:04
Its a huracan tho, they have normal doors. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:39:16
Well, I dont know more about the future then the next guy, but thats what im doing. 100% btc.
@_date: 2018-08-15 07:22:40
Whatever it takes to make a buck. Cant be playing nice in this world. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:15:24
Sold mine for 18$ in 2014. ��
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:17:47
I wonder how many people have one or more. I bet its not that many. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:21:59
Yea whales had enough, bcash to be terminated. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:46:28
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:24:58
Yea same here. Still have my rigs running, barely breaking even. Although I exchange everything to btc.
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:04:32
One million club? Did we just find satoshi?
Edit: Nvm thought it meant 1 million btc. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:18:11
Ye thought it was a good move at the time. Same as this guy is thinking now. ��
@_date: 2018-05-07 06:12:43
Its because people like Andreas that I have no doubt about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 11:49:40
What do you guys think? Is the near future looking bright? 
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:05:52
Glorious day. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:45:46
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:04:09
Haha, hahahaha. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 00:10:09
If right, I rich. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:08:53
And there goes 12k
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:06:01
My guess is bigger blocks eventually. But thats only after they have made every other optimization. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:36:55
Gotta love big lenny
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:32:08
Yep. I remember getting close to 1 btc/day on a AMD 6990. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:22:21
Started mining when it was 10$. I can respect their frustration but hopefully they will realize the future potential. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:46:14
So you are related to Craig Wright, must feel shitty. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:51:10
Dissapointing performance, haha. Did you find out about bitcoin in december or what have you been smoking? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:42:02
Damn, you must have been among the first. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:38:34
True. But this market is such a revolution and its so hard to predict what the future has in store for bitcoin. It has amazed me so many times during the 7 years ive been invested. So ive come to the conclusion that this is my way going forward and that I will be focusing my time in other areas. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:53:43
12k on monday? Yes please
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:54:02
I have decided to hold untill 2022 and reavaluate from there.
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:58:33
If 11k is new floor now im very happy. But I dont know. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:29:25
Hey you noncoiner, you mad you missed the gravy train? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:59:43
Well played. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:51:15
"tried to crash Bitcoin" what a joke. He can sell how many bitcoin he wants. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:49:38
Hehe im in for the long run. Although its never fun losing over half of your value in btc, its a necessary must. I personally lost way to many bitcoins over the years trading. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:30:03
Damn im so tempted to put an order in on a porsche gt3. Yeye I know its not a lambo but still... What a time to be alive. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:27:04
This guy... 
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:13:18
End of Bitcoin is upon us.
 Just kidding what do I know. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:45:13
I already lost 200k. Because I want more lambos ofc. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:59:14
Just about enough :) still get a measly 10 mbtc/day from mining, but that is just for fun.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:08:23
Where are all the "just sell and buy lower" now?
Im just accumulating.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:04:57
Good now what will be the low? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:57:50
Still down. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:24:33
How low will it go? Im ready to buy
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:59:48
Yep. Dealer said 2019 q1 delivery so got some thinking to do. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:59:31
I predict 40k by december. Keep hoarding. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:52:16
If it stays above 11k im very pleased. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:38:06
When you know its going to 100k it isnt hard. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:25:59
This is great! Time to get ready to buy a shitload. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:29:21
Price is recovering much faster then I expected. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:38:37
Luck you mean.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:47:39
Cant be many miners turning profit a these prices. I sure as shit aint. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:07:01
Indeed. I still run a small mining operation so I also hope the price stays suppressed for some time. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:53:57
Good. Keep gathering. Im aiming for 200.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:32:07
Ah this is perfect for me. My biggest fear with Bitcoin is that I wont be able to accumulate enough. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:02:19
Enough to lose a few days of sleep. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:49:45
Im sure it would be a lot of fun. Although im sure your a nice guy with good intentions, I cannot accept the offer considering the risk for the 5$ wrench situation. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:19:56
Wish I had the balls to do it... 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:36:48
Shhh. Thats not the point. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:22:47
Oh god it's easy to make money sometimes. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:35:23
Indeed. Plus im looking for that driving experience. Ive always been a huge porsche guy and thanks to btc my dream is within reach. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:35:43
Woho lets make some moolah. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:46:08
Oh im sure. Good thing I found out about btc at $10.
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:10:52
Always nice waking up 10k richer. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:30:45
I want 10 mil so I can go big in real estate. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:21:42
From 19k to 6 was rougher. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:32:24
Im down 200k in two days. Happy weekend everybody. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:07:01
I have a feeling its Mcafee buying furiously trying to save his ass (dick) with the 15k (1M) prediction. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:31:57
Thing is ive always been lazy. Im just lucky I found out about bitcoin back in 2011. But I got some plans about moving into real estate once I hit a number im satisifed with. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:51:42
Will it stay over 10k? I hope so... 
@_date: 2018-07-24 10:31:39
I sure hope they gain some. My gpu mining rigs give me really shitty returns atm. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:19:37
I wouldnt see myself as smart considering I panic sold 150 btc at 550$ after the mtgox fiasco. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:25:32
Should keep the old Daily discussions so I can make fun of all the traders with their TA
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:22:46
My family always said I would never amount to anything. If they only knew Im already a millionare hahaha.
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:00:57
Thanks for the tip, I will make sure to get the book. Me and my brother have always had a dream about buying a small catamaran. Maybe one day. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:57:11
Go with your guts if you have the balls. I sure dont. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:36:00
I'm waiting for the storm to pass, I have no clue how far it will drop. I hope it hits sub 4k.
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:21:01
If true hes in for a proper nightmare. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:40:01
We keep bouncing on 7500. Hopefully we smash through it soon. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 16:44:58
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:14:59
8k baby! Only 992k to go. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:00:58
Good times being a hodler these days. Cant be mad when its going upupup. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:25:01
Im right there with you. Sold some back in early Jan but in hindsigt obviously not enough. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:57:45
Got some cash laying around after an investment, and looking to top up my holdings to a nice even number. Trying to time the low, although highly doubt ill succeed. But I must say im enjoying this ride down in a weird way.
@_date: 2018-12-08 09:35:58
Indeed, the 100k club would be quite something.
