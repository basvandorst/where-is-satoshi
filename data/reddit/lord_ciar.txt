I don't see a reason why a published professor would claim this if it hadn't been done. He seems quite sure his students and perhaps even himself have done it on occassion. Several people in this thread have allready claimed it could be done. Nothing is 100% secure.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:09:16
would it? All kinds of funds can be stolen or falsified. What makes bitcoin so special? Math?
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:58:38
That all depends on just how hard it is to do so and in what cases.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:10:28
Guys claims it's possible and has been done several times by his students and has proven it. Not that it's easy or general, but many things are possible if you really want to.

It's a bit like ebay and amazon. Scetchy products are still there and you take a risk on new sellers.

So we reinvented paper money?
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:28:23
Thats because ppl arent using bitcoin for payments but as an investement. And thats why bitcoin has a problem in the near future.

That's the problem isn't it, things that grow to fast tend to collapse upon themselves. Blockchain tech is certainly interesting and Bitcoin will be remembered, the question is, wil IT be used or just be remembered. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:47:39
there is a fallacy in that argument. Bitcoin is limited but not tied to anything. If it isnt used in payments its value is essentially zero. People treat it as a commodity for now.

Its good investement advice. Its basic investement advice that many people, every day, forget. They blow their pensions, rent money, car payments on *"a sure thing"* putting all their eggs in one basket for *"huge gains"* that vanish or never even materialise.

In Belgium at least, is most certainly is the case:  
Although I assume this is based on European obligation so it would surprise me if we where the only one.

The fact is that funds that give a low return but guarantee your capital are not the best investesments but they do assure you that you will still have the capital in the future. The yield on it sucks, but 10.000€ now will still be 10.000€ in 5 years, it will just buy your less 'stuff'.
Investing capital in something more high risk, lets say shares of a company could mean you lose it all.  There could be 0 return from investement, there could be no more investement.
Recently in Belgium, where I am from, a whole batch of people invested in a share, heavily pushed by banks and a union totally collapsed leaving many of the investors (small time investors, people with pensions, working families, etc) with nothing. Some of these investors used their nestegg to buy these shares because they believed and where told that the margines would be much better then a saving accounts (which obviously suck) it would pay out a high interest and they wouldn't be able to lose. They did, the banking crisis came and the share was turn into a bad bank, nothing remains of its high value. Now they have nothing.
Those  people have nothing of their investement left while those that put it in a savings account stil have their money. Its  depreciating but they still have the capital sum. The investors took a risk and that is ok, but if you take a risk with your nestegg and you lose it all, your old age is going to suck and you have no fall back to build something up again. Therefore you only invest what you can lose.

Yeah golden and silver coins are totally the future, at least that's what they keep telling me at and @_date: 2014-09-23 22:39:32
People say that but I never had any problem with paypal *ever* and I use it almost daily for years. As a client though, not a trader.

Well what is the alternative? Bring a whole batch of my gold tot he bank to exchange for bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-12-17 21:13:50
I do to! It's right here in my... oh ... I see what you tried to do here!
Then again, holding gold isn't exactly hard, it's much easier to hold and get then bitcoin.

Nothing to lose if you try though. Even a 0.5% chance that it works is good odds of return to *life*.
