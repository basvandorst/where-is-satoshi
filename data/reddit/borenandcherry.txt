Wow, is this true, do you have a source for that because it's astounding of true. I thought I had poor saving habits.
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:38:03


I'm guessing there's not a source for this either.  Forget I asked.

So this is a thing now, cool.

This joke is pretty old and not entirely relevant anymore.

But they're our pain in the ass.

Except the author doesn't think that. The purpose of the writer's article/title was to demonstrate the value and importance of the blockchain, not to say that it is separate from bitcoin; it's meant to encourage more understanding.

Shouldn't it be BYU?

I just posted and it never even showed up in /new - this is awesome!

Why not a million? Sorry, I didn't have time to sketch something up in mspaint.
Edit- at least did!

Cost of living in Rochester is much better than Boston; though that's about the only thing Rochester has going for it compared to Boston.

Why don't you tell us the name of the movie you'd like to see?

I have this guy tagged as "Seems to know his BTC shit"; I trust him.  Bitcoin is definitely not Snapchat.

Yep, definitely empty your bank account and buy all the bitcoin you can. I'm sure this message would be approved by the Bitcoin CEO.  Also, there's definitely no sarcasm here.  Not even a little bit.

It's similar to if I were to criticize an essay of yours (hypothetical) by saying, "forget grammar, focus on the content."
You're asking me about punctuation, trying to get everything precise and perfect, and I'd say, "forget grammar, focus on the content.  Content is king."
I'm not saying to *literally* forget about using proper grammar.  I'm saying forget about it because I'm focusing on something that is relevant but not explicitly related.  Bitcoin are the tokens of the blockchain.  Grammar and syntax are the building blocks of good content.  I can tell you to forget about grammar in discussions about your content without you taking that literally.

Cheers, mate. I like you too.

A quick search would have yielded the answer.  Suffice to say it's harder to get fiat in/out and run by unknown figures, giving it a less reliable (more risky) perception.

I work in support and we use Zendesk; the error described is not how it works in ZD. Once a ticket is assigned to an agent (a support rep) it goes back into that rep's queue when the ticket is re-opened. This just sounds like an overwhelmed support staff, which isn't surprising with their assumed influx of users.
OP needs to cool his fucking jets. He sounds like the asshole that tweets to the CEO when he hasn't gotten an immediate response.

That's because you're a [raving lunatic]( with delusions of grandeur and also someone who famously lost a truckload of money on penny stocks and continues to sit on, and beat, your own dead horse.  You're [the guy in handcuffs](  For Christ's sake, you are the [creator and moderator of your own subreddit](  You are a textbook megalomaniac. *Why would anyone listen to you?*

This is so wrong. 8bit is spot on.
