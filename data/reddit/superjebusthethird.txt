My multiple sending attempts did not go trough.
Tried again a few minutes ago, all went fine, put the rest in my paper wallet and everything had the first confirmations already. All good.
 
Wanted to show my friends how easy it is using Bitcoin. Glad they knew what DDoS is and they were still okay with it. Any other of my friends would have thought something bad about Bitcoin because they don't understand the technical side of it and what DDoS is.

I  only have a ubuntu live cd and no knowledge and time to install wallet clients. Bitcoin QT wallets (latest) stopped working anyway on &gt;all&lt; computers.
So I **need to do it** via a web wallet.
 
So all I can do is wait. I have a static IP which cant be changed even if I wanted to. If cloudflare blacklisted me whysoever I guess I am fucked.

Go to  search for the download link on the main page, download it to an usb stick, boot a safe machine with the free ubuntu live cd (google "Ubuntu", download and then burn the Live CD to a DVD) with your hdd and ethernet cable unplugged(!!!), create your bitcoin paper wallet by launching the html file that you find after you extracted the zip file from your usb stick and follow the easy 3 steps.
For the love of god, please use the so called "BIP38" encryption method.
Why? Because when you save the pdf print files of your created paper wallets to your stick you can easily print it from an unsafe online computer. Your private key is protected, nobody can steal your bitcoin without the BIP38 private key.
 
Always remember to WRITE THE BIP38 KEY ON A PIECE OF PAPER and NEVER SAVE IT DIGITALLY.
After you've done that 2-3 times you know the drill. It's easy as pie and just takes minutes.
 
When you are done: Congratulations! You have a SAFE Bitcoin Paper Wallet which can never be hacked. You can decrypt the private key with the bitcoinpaperwallet.com "validate" feature and use the decrypted private key for importing your bitcoin  into your bitcoin application of choice or bitcoin web wallet. After the import you may spend some bitcoin and simply send the remaining amount to a new paper wallet. Never use one wallet twice after you exposed your decrypted private key. Safest long term or emergency storage. Bullet and fool proof. 
I have always 2 empty paper wallets in my house, you never know when you may need it. :)
 
Just do it, it's really worth it.
 
Last advice: NEVER store bitcoin longer than needed on a web wallet like blockchain or something else. If you visit the wrong website you get infected with malware which instantly steals your coins. Being your own bank means to take security serious(!).
OffTopic: Paper Wallets are also great as a gift. I always create new paper wallets with some small amount of bitcoin in it for giving away to people that would like to have their first bitcoin but dont know how to get them. :) always makes people happy. 
Read into these things more when you find time, trust me it's fun and totally worth it.

Wipe all the data of your device and reinstall the whole OS. You are infected with something very bad. Do it as fast as you can. Until you do that stop exposing important data like passwords or private keys on that device. If you use external usb storage drives on that device these might be infected too.
 
Send all your bitcoin to a paper wallet or a trusted friend who clearly knows that his system is safe. If you can't create a paper wallet yourself right now ask a friend to do it for you who you really really trust 110%! See my other comment in this thread which teaches how to do it.

I never had _any_ big problems that ended in lost coins or even downloading the whole blockchain again because of errors or hackers. (I only redownload the blockchain when I have to set up some OS again, which might happen every now and then.)
 
If it happened on my Mac only I'd think "Mh. Okay."
But it happened on 2 different machines the same day. I am thinking about playing the local Lottery. I'm usually handling all my wallets pretty paranoid. But of course I need to use a hot wallet every now and then. And this makes me nervous, maybe I shouldn't do a transfer from my Exchange of choice to my Hot Wallet right now.
 
The only things both clients &amp; machines have in common are:
 
*Both latest Bitcoin-QT version 
 
*I installed them on both machines the same day (started with bootstrap.dat, both were fine after full sync) 
 
*Same network (of course my serious paper wallet storage is created offline with every paranoid steps you can imagine) 
 
Any ideas? Why could this happen on 2 clients at the same moment? what are the odds that some fishy things are going on?
 
 
Client version: The latest, I reinstalled both a few days ago with the latest release I could find on bitcoin.org
 
P.S.: OS X dictionary is a bitch and changes "bitcoin" into "bit coin".

Oh god, please guys. Please stop using single words as whole sentences. It's not cool anymore and an absolute no-go for the Bitcoin identity.

Decentralized freedom does always taste better. So the answer is: Yes.
@_date: 2014-05-04 23:19:34
I'm also really interested for seeing an accurate answer on that.
@_date: 2014-04-30 18:55:05
Tunnel snakes!
@_date: 2014-04-08 19:56:34
Yes, sure.
But I am wondering how this happens after ages using Bitcoin-QT without problems on the same day on different machines. That's what makes me think..
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:59:11
I tried sending the amounts several times. Do they get sent delayed and the destination wallets get 5 times more Bitcoin if I tried sending them 5 times??
@_date: 2014-05-06 23:39:38
Hey very cool thank you! :-)
My last tip or whatever it was got stuck in the last tipbot :-/ wasnt enough to transfer.
How do I transfer out small sums? Just to make sure this doesn't happen again! (:
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:03:34
Because we are the tunnel snakes!
@_date: 2014-04-28 22:49:00
Whatever is going on in here - I'm in too.
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:09:05
Thought about that too, but that's clearly not it.
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:38:50
Uh, yes! Thanks and thanks again!
Isn't the tipbot handled via Reddit's PM system anymore?
If I try to send these from my changetip account to my wallet, it says it's not enough. I'm also a bit confused how much BTC that is. 0.001 right? Error message said it's not enough and needs to be at least 0.001.
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:38:37
Okay I am waiting with my friends. I hope the DDoS doesn't get the funds stolen.
 
What alternate web wallet would you recommend for importing the paper wallet and sending the Bitcoin to 3 adresses without the need to be an IT expert
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:53:58
I love this.
 
But somehow I can already imagine myself being drunk walking trough stores and bars waving and stumbling. Next morning I notice that I've sent $1000 to random merchants for no reason.
@_date: 2014-04-18 23:19:52
I never said having an Android device. If so I would have mentioned it.

**Welcome to Club 1 my friend!**
 
With your 1 Bitcoin you own more than the average users around. (Forgot the exact percentage)
 
Consider yourself lucky in a few years if you manage to not panic sell. (Long term holding. If you want to spend it anyway and don't care about holding, well that's cool too because you are helping the economy grow!)
 
Have fun with endless nights wandering trough the Internet, discussing Bitcoin and learning about the 1 BTC you have gained access to. You are now part of a big movement that's just getting started.
It's great fun. I remember my first time, took me months. Spent every night around on Bitcoin related websites, IRC and what not. Still feels great to have Bitcoin and now fully understand how it works. :)
 
I personally love to spend and hold Bitcoin. Feels great. I don't really care about massive price drops and what not. I'm buying more Bitcoin every month and holding it the most safe way possible which makes it even impossible for me to _quickly panic sell_ because of some reason. I'm also considering buying some Bitcoin for my daughter some time and of course giving some away for my parents and my brother because they have a hard time understanding Bitcoin. The last question was "So you can't buy anything with Bitcoin in our city right? Why should we own it." Well, I am going to visit them some day and order some Pizza and what not and pay with Bitcoin out of the blue. This might show skeptic people (like my parents) and others that it really works and why anyone should consider using it.
(Sorry for wall of text)
 
Edit: Like others said in this thread, be _careful_ with brain wallets. You might want to take a look into the creation of "BIP 38 protected Paper Wallets" (bitcoinpaperwallet.com) which is pretty easy and the most secure way.
 
Have fun man and remember: Don't be sad when the price sometimes drops. We are just getting started and this are the usual up and downs. Some day the price swings will be very low (this is where High Frequency Trading comes into play).

Hey, thanks! I'm looking forward tipping it to someone else in here. (: Thanks again!

He better finds a good place to hide. Not because FBI. Some of his victims might come for his balls.
Damn fucker. Hope he really get's screwed up.
 
Reading this just makes me angry...
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:51:12
I still don't like it and I don't believe half of all Bitcoin users will like it within the next months. Years. Whatever.
We all had the discussions about this and we all know that this identity redesign is just the biggest faceplant ever.
@_date: 2014-05-04 17:04:09
Sadly it's never going to happen. No innovation wanted over there.
