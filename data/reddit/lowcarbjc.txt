Maybe in 2.5 years. Right now everyone and his momma are so sh1t scared to keep it when it reaches 1100. 10k is totally possible, heck 50k or 100k too, but maybe not in 11 months considering the history. Most important thing is, it seems to be going up, not down. Bitcoin works the same at 10k as it works at $300.

Fantastic answer thanks. How can one get the exchanges to pay higher fees? I honestly dont care to pay a bit more. I paid a silly 0.15 BTC from Xapo to BitX Luno yesterday (both rather well known exchanges) and it took 13.5 hours for the first confirmation to show.

Money laundering is an act that happens AFTER a crime, to hide the criminal monies. It's not the crime itself. Like a getaway car at a bank robbery. The car is fine, it's the act.

Great topic. I pay only parking meters in real fiat, the rest I use Xapo debit card for. My clients pay me in btc. Still have bank accounts but they hardly see any use these days. I keep about R100 zar in each, less that $10 lol.

Xapo is pretty awesome, I know they do not deliver it to the USA but I will be using my card itselfon my USA trip in a few days. There are no current tax laws on Bitcoin here in SA that I know of. Still want to see how they can tax me on something that is not really "money" with the price fluctuating all the time. As an aside, do not keep all your bitcoins in exchanges (Xapo, Coinbase or any other one) - keep it in some reputable hardware wallet or in a paper wallet(s) of which you have enough copies. ALL Exchanges can be hacked and then you loose everything - and have no one to go to complain to really. :) I am planning to go totally "bankfree" this year and Xapo makes it easier for me. Looking forward to see more places here and abroad accepting bitcoin.

Exactly what Rusty said yes make sure you have 2 or 3 copies in some ebcrypted format even if its just some stupid encryption anything is better than no encryption.

Yes it's fine. No one controls it, just like Pokemon cards or a rubber band around your arm or a bag of marbles it's not money (unless you want it to be) and yours to do with as you please. My sisters kids are 8, 6 and 5 and they all own bitcoin. Go figure - the future is yours :)
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:26:46
Do they own 90% of ALL crypto currencies for ever? Surely they have one so much money. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:29:37
Not weekly anymore, but every few days now, wonder why people keep doing that! 
@_date: 2017-01-19 03:53:22
It's 'reward coins' created out of thin air by the software. Keep in mind that it's only "money" because people decided that it had "money" value. Unlike FIAT currency that gets printed by will by corrupt governments, this is a kind of thank you for the energy (electricity) spent to it's miners and provided at a set declining (yet increasing in difficulty) rate until one day no more will be created, simulating real mining for something like gold.
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:14:25
Sign transaction offline when spending? Please explain? Thanks
@_date: 2017-01-23 08:19:57
Use offline paper wallets for large amounts or storage - period. I don't even fully trust these so called secure hardware wallets. There is no proof to me that the people who programmed it (or any app) hasn't got some funny code somewhere on it that triggers randomly and transfers the info somewhere. Papper wallets offline by a open source site like bitaddress.org (tripple check the spelling) is what I use for storage. Keep in mind to print it (more than one copy), never store it as a pdf or similar file, and always sweep the FULL amount from a paper wallet when you take it out one day. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 07:09:12
Thanks Joshua, amazing answer! 
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:24:53
Ok thank you
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:53:27
Thanks, I am not so much in a mystery about how they get the info from the block chain, but how they manage to remember new private keys that the user import's info. I speculate that they do not store the new private keys, but basically allows you to sweep it into that "master secret" key only. If that makes any sense. Thanks again for a great answer Alex.

Find a dictionary of another language that is easily obtainable. Find the corresponding word in that language. Dot down the page and word number. (5-19 means page 5 word 19). Change numbers to letters. Put simple encryption to it and store it on the blockchain.

Thank you.

I since learned that my question is not so smart and unique (haha) and a better question and similar great answers on this link. 
Also, even more important, from another this site, the magic answer I was looking for:
"Please note that imported addresses are NOT backed up by the wallet recovery phrase. We strongly recommend you sweep funds from imported addresses."
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:05:33
Awesome, so many great uses for Bitcoin

Don't forget  as another option. It only deals in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-20 10:49:49
Ha, true. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 23:04:34
This is what worked for me. If you don't like it find what works for you. Nothing beats memory and repetition. Take the words and make a little story by thinking of how you would drive or walk from your house to a place and seeing those objects along the way in the order that the a route takes you. Make a little story of why a word like DOLPHIN is next to the neighbors house and why a word like COMPREHEND would be at the street corner. The words should be placed in the same order the route takes you.  It's what I did and repeating the order for yourself once a week will have it in your memory forever. Finally, simply circle the first letter of each word as they appear in a book, just to remind you what the letter is it starts with, in a book that no one would ever bother looking at. You can add a random letter in between if you are seriously paranoid or do it backwards, or whatever you like. Can it be cracked, of course, does this method work for me, yea. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 11:02:19
How open source are these so called secure Hardware wallets really? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:39:59
Not if its kept in bitcoin, only if he converts it back to fiat. It's not governments property to tax. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:27:09
Do some of these wallet providers / exchanges store the words for you on your online profile? I really hope not! 
@_date: 2017-01-26 16:05:31
I fail to see how a hardware wallet is more secure than a paper wallet done right. I suppose each to his own :) thanks for your answers
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:17:19
The only thing Satoshi (assuming it is a single dude) has right now is more Bitcoin than the average Joe on street. That's it. The source and protocols etc are 100% open source and the current version people use to mine with is different (improved many times) from his original version. Throwing him in jail or even sending out a message doing so would not stop bitcoin or altcoins dead in it's tracts. Can not see why his life would be in danger in terms of secret knowledge he has, except maybe if someone is after his personal bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 21:45:13
It simply allows for dealing with multiple currencies. You spend the bitcoin directly in the currency of that country without having to hassle with travelers cheques etc. It's all I use when I travel, never had a problem in any country. :)

On the Amazon question, many many places allow you to buy amazon and other gift cards with bitcoin. 
There will always be someone who will if the need and enough demand arise, play middleman (for a fee) and take your X and trade it with Y to give you Z, no matter what X, Y and Z is. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 11:07:02
If everyone use bitcoin and many avoid tax paying since it's so easy then - how will governments build and fix roads, provide infrastructures etc?

Get a Xapo debit card if time allows for it, takes 3-5 days if you take the DHL option. Never worry again.

I wonder which exchange the IRS is gonna use as rule to know exactly how much profit you made. At this day, hour and minute Bitfinex trades at 1356, Coinbase at 1249 and Local Bitcoins at 1655 per bitcoin.

The backup words seed is different from the passcode. You need to, after you delete and reinstalled it, use the backup seed first before you can guess again what the passcode is. Two sets of info you need. I think that is how it works.

Sorry about your loss buddy. Make very sure you use  and not something like bitcoinmixer.io or any other variation of it. I lost ZAR R680 the other day by this stupid mistake and some idiot thief got my hard earned btc. Lesson learned. Also check that the letter of Gaurantee states the correct dates, the fake sites (or at least the one fake site I used) also provides letters of Gaurantee's but the dates on this one was wrong. Read everything in that letter of Gaurantee before proceeding. Used it a few times after that and it works great, provided you use the right address :)
