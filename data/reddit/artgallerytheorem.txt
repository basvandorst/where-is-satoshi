I am sound investor. I have had a decent returns upon my securities. I do play with options once in a while. Bitcoin is not an investment. It has value as technology but all the die hard fans have serioosly overvalued it beyond any sane reason. Its a bubble and has already acquired the trend of a bursting bubble.

First rule of investment: Invest money and not your emotions into any asset. Majority of the posters here are literally treated bitcoin as their kid, whose school marks are all they are concerned about. Any time the kid does bad, its the teacher's fault. If the score is good, " Aww, my kid is a superstar"

Bitcoin was never meant to be what the naive investors have made it to be. A big giant ass bubble and millions will end up losing billions of money once they realize its a piece of technology and not a philosopher's stone. 
As far as I see, Bitcoin is not proving any of its supposed benefits. Transaction costs are high, lack of security, criminal connections. 
Anything that is liable to be used by terrorists is going to be shut down. Its plain and simple.

At its best Tulip bulb was worth $200,000 today you can get them for around $ 10. So on similar lines.. Bitcoin will still find value but at $1 .

So bitcoin is slower than cellphones and computers. Seems legit, considering the horrible transaction times

Thanks, I will wait when bitcoin is credited with the cure for cancer too!

Why is this in bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:19:44
The RBI made crypto illegal so the banks have to comply.

Charts can be made to show anything you want to see. Its a feel good mirror

You are contradicting yourself every few words! 
HODL, is the intent to create enough scarcity to spike price, The price of the asset is being spiked due to forced scarcity not because of its inherent value. Hodlgang is intentionally distorting the value of cryptocurrency.

I mentioned fad not Bitcoin. Blockchain is an awesome anti-hacker technology. But bitcoin will not find general use as long as transaction times remain 10 minutes. It is too energy intensive and transaction charges spike up significantly whenever there is a bull run.

Thanks man!

I despise any institution that calls for the head of the people for the simple sin that they don't believe in their "God"

Same thing Myspace said about facebook,
Yahoo asked Google
Nokia, blackberry asked Android and Apple!

How on earth is Bitcoin equivalent to internet. It is the first cryptocurrency just like IBM in computers. It may even be up like Nokia.

You are free to do whatever you want. The only thing is that being a blind hodlgang member is against the very principles of Bitcoin and block-chain technology.
Hodlgang bitch about government control but don't mind their own control over currency by being hoarders.

Number of active users has dropped by half.. Nopes not gonna happen
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:50:02
A new tech will be developed and price of Bitcoin will drop to near zero. Ever heard of Kodak, Nokia, Yahoo, Myspace.

I see the argument of low fees being totaly disregarded when the reality hits crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-01 11:58:05
The joke is going a bit toooo long for the hodlgang.

In the long term we are all dead
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:56:31
I am a PhD. in Mathematics and frankly my dear , you have no idea what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:56:13
How will bitcoin survive with awful transaction times and high charges?
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:46:49
AFAIK, all religions are haram! 
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:03:11
Your reply had no substance just attacks on me rather than my POV. and when I replied back in kind you cant handle it .. tsk tsk
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:23:54
Does the difference between hoarding and saving escaping your mind completely. Saving is done to meet your future needs, while hoarding is done to create shortage and sell when the price of your asset spikes up.

It was the result of dumping after the short pump yesterday. More pumping and dumping coming soon.
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:30:32
Somebody explain to me how on earth will bitcoin check inflation. A limited supply of some arbitrary money will just promote hoarding. And hoarding will simply choke the life out of economy.
