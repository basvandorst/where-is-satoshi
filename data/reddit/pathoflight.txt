with asymmetric cryptography you can do two things: 
1. encrypt a payload so only people with the proper keys can unencrypt the data (what the government is after) 
2. verifies authenticity. You can prove you have position of a data, without actually showing the data. (bitcoin uses this feature to sign coins over to a new private key holder) 
you are confusing encryption with cryptography. Encryption is a type of cryptography. cryptography is not all encryption.

Bitcoin network works based on  a hash function. You're not encrypting your data. You do use ecdsa to sign shit, but that's only used to verify authenticity of the transaction, not to encrypt it.

very very simple: 
Take any digital file. In this case I used a picture of my daughter at the hospital with me and my wife in the background.  I opened it up in a photo editor and added bunch of info,  in this case: Name, date of birth, father, mother, location, etc.  saved the file and hashed it up. To do that you can go [here]( and select browse, pick your file and hash that bad boy up.  You grab the hex, something like (2d6c9a90dd38f6852515274cde41a8cd8e7e1a7a053835334ec7e29f61b918dd) and head over to bitaddress.org and go to "wallet details" and paste your hex in the field that says "Enter Private Key" then hit generate.   Now you have created a wallet (key pair) using your picture. now send 5 cents to it using your favorite wallet. You're done as soon as you get one confirmation. :D

Two inputs, one digital and one non digital. 
Digital: 
I hashed a photo of her, mum and I with a watermark that read: 
NAME: xxx
DOB: xxx
TOB: xxxx
and placed the photo in a tiny tiny flash drive attached to her baby book. (we also have copies else where. ) 
For non-digital I simply hashed: 
NAME: xxx
DOB: xxx
TOB: xxxx

I don't know! I'm asking you. But to say that :


is a bit naive. Of course they don't want it to happen, but the complete collapse of the monetary system has happened in history over and over and over and to think it can't happen again, or we are in the last phase is a bit silly. I don't know how we are going to pay mortgages. I don't know what will happen to the price of bread. we are in uncharted territories my friend. I mean one day you're enjoying being at the top or near the top of economic prosperity, [and the next day you're building a house of cards with stacks of worthless cash! literally.](

You want anonymity use local Bitcoins. Coinbase is one of the most trusted names as far as regulations and such so they won't or shouldn't steal your coins but they are a force in centralization of Bitcoin in my opinion. I personality am not a fan. Plus they will ask you all kinds of questions about your finances and that's because of regulations.

We need the LN. Without LN even a TB blocks won't be enough if you want to record: 
-day to day transactions for billions of people
-settlement services 
-market services/stocks (colored coins) 
-IoT transactions
-smart contracts: (insurance, crowd-funds, etc)
-other things i haven't listed or don't exist yet. 
we need the LN (or something like it)  or bitcoin will be a great store of value but it won't make it as a medium of exchange or will it do what it was meant to do. Get rid of the middle man.

seriously though... yes. Bitcoin is not ready for the day to day transactions for billions of people yet. with things like SW and LN things are looking good.

Thats why I put all of my trust in the true cypherpunks. People who ACTUALLY built this damn thing to free us from the pesky central / trusted 3rd party. So if you ask me whats my opinion on the block size debate, I will side with Adam Back ,Nick Szabo and Rusty instead of Mike fucking Hearn. It's not even a tough decision! It's like; would you like to sniff a skunks ass? or would you rather have a ham sandwich? 


That author, Mike Hearn, is a member of “the foursquare community” advancing technological developments at the current time, despite Wikipedia reports that GOOGLE terminated that program.
Alternatively, the GOOGLE-CIA-Hearn is highly controversial, having been invited by the CIA’s private capital investment group, In-Q-TEL, to brief them on his expertise in the “Bitcoin” enterprise that is commercially competing with the Central Banks. These are the world’s most powerful banks directed by members of The Rothschild League, including JP Morgan-CHASE and Goldman Sachs in NYC. It is public knowledge that the British Secret Service and the CIA operates most actively on behalf of these Anglo-American business interests critical to national security, geopolitics, governmental policies and economics. 
For your information, these British and American intelligence agencies are most interested in the Bitcoin enterprise advocated by this, Mr. Hearn.
In-Q-TEL reportedly operates as a CIA not-for-profit venture capital firm. It evaluated Bitcoin Virtual Currency for investment potential and possible replacement for the Federal Reserve, World Bank, and the Global Monetary Fund.
Besides the CIA’s interest in Hearn and Bitcoin, GOOGLE is partnered with the CIA in the “Internet Data Mining Project” in the company called, “Recorded Future.”

it gets annoying when every freaking few days since last year, and his XT fiasco, Gavin has something to say about block size. 
"oh... Global warming, so we need to increase the block size"

@_date: 2016-02-26 19:43:11


yes! 


community? or payment processors and exchanges like coinbase? I'm part of the community. I run a couple of nodes. I've been involved since 2013. I DON'T WANT BLOCK SIZE INCREASED, at least just yet and I KNOW i'm not alone. 


that guy was trying to push 20MB blocks! WTF ?!?!?1 seriously? now he is like.. OH.. i think we are going to be okay with 2MB. Are you sure?   Aren't you all glad we didn't fork to ShitT?  
Yes, people are starting to wake up. You know, those 3 letter agencies have been fairly quiet regarding Bitcoin. Don't you think that's a bit odd? I sure as hell do! and you know, they are COVERT agencies. they do COVERT operations! Do you know what that word means?
adjective: covert
    1.
    not openly acknowledged or displayed.
    "covert operations against the dictatorship"
    synonyms:	secret, furtive, clandestine, surreptitious, stealthy, cloak-and-dagger, hole-and-corner, backstairs, backroom, hidden, under-the-table, concealed, private, undercover, underground;
    informalhush-hush
 
WTF is wrong with you. Thats how they work! They are trained in this shit and they get paid very well to do what they do!

Everyone dismissed it but Hal. Your point about his decline is moot. His original email went to the cypherpunk mailing list, before he decided to post it on the p2p forum and no one took it seriously, mostly because he was not a well known figure. (or not at all I should say). 
I trust Adam a lot more than Gavin or Mike, and I know I'm not alone on that. 
Also, opt-in! it's very important. Stop spreading FUDDDDDD

Yes. Because a shitposter online is more evil than a financial terrorist. A man directly responsible ( along with a gang of his friends) for decimating the middle class, and stealing TRILLIONS of dollars from the unborn so he and his crooked friends can continue on their shenanigans. A piece of shit who  has the balls to threaten people who have found a way to get off of his rape rides with cage time. Is that what you mean? Your moral compass is awe-inspiring  sir. Kudos to you.  Way to stand up to evil.

mining is not profitable man! it hasn't been since like early 2013
