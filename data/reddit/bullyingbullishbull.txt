Non-programmers like me be warned, this book is 90% about the actual Bitcoin Core code. Only the introduction discusses it's history and fundamentals on a non techy level.

I agree, halfway through that myself. Also Age of Cryptocurrency is good too.

What stops someone from turning off there Hotspot as soon as they pay? Or will you be using some sort of smart contract?

I believed...wrong year though :/

I figure it must be something good due to the investments and investors they are recieving, along with how secretive they are. I'd be amazed to see the most funded and secretive Bitcoin company come out with a product that isn't innovative and useful.

I understand where your coming from, but there's no real community in those subs, so it's hard to find any good discussion there.

Maybe I missed it but I didn't see any mention of windows 10 or Xbox one incorporating a btc wallet into their systems

Agreed, there are so many different multiplayer servers nowadays I'm sure you'll find one you like. The one I found that I fell in love with has only 20-40 people online at a time, so make sure you even try the less popular ones, cuz you never know which one you'll get hooked too.

Yes you are. Seriously, how does he find a dogecoin upgrade anywhere near similar to Etheruem starting it's genesis block?

The record contains a block reward for the miner though, which is money. So you do get money within the record aka block. 
And you don't just process one transaction, you can do that or process many transactions or none at all.

It's right there in the first link you posted

Atleast he mentioned it, maybe the writers will look into the technology one week to do a segment on it whenever the media starts talking about it again. 
Edit: Btw I would agree with him, it is rather hard to spend at the moment. Very very few places accept bitcoin.

Is this real? This can't be real.

Don't worry Bitcoin Ain't broke, actually performing just as expected. You'll see it not find a block for two hours even on rare occasion. It's math, it happens.

This is what bitcoin what meant for. Get this in more countries that need it!
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:31:36
I feel like we need a book like this for adults.
@_date: 2015-02-12 06:21:46
BitInstant is that you?

Back in my day, $247 got you about 12 bitcoins, those were the days.
