Why are all the Dogecoin fans so upset with r/bicoins attitude.  Why not just concentrate on posting on your own subreddit if your worried by negative comments.  
If you all moved away from boring old Bitcoin to have the time if your lives over at Dogecoin why look back and care what everyone here thinks by constantly posting about Dogecoin. 
There would tend to be plenty of negativity when people that bought at $1000-$1200 are seeing a loss. If prices move upwards and make new all time highs the general sentiment across bitcointalk Reddit etc. will change in the blink of an eyelid. 
So please stop posting about how this is why I moved away fom Bitcoin blah blah blah, bitcoin is spearheading everything even lowly old second placed litecoin is larger in market cap than Dogecoin and the 100 other cryptocoins below it added together.  
If you want to see Dogecoin do well it might be better that you put at least a portion of your energies into promoting Bitcoin as increasing bitcoins market cap will boost Dogecoins more than attempting to move yours in isolation.

You probably thought Bitcoiners enthusiasm was equally moronic 4 years ago when just about nobody had heard about it, hardly anyone accepted it or used it.  
I could buy Bitcoin for as little as £2.50 back in the day but it was still riskier spending £1000 on Bitcoin back then than now. If your only interested or would use or buy Bitcoin when the majority of consumers are doing so then it's best waiting 5-10 years. You will pay much much more for your btc but the risk will be greatly reduced.  
But keep in mind when you do buy that it was all those Bitcoiners before you that took a greater risk buying when there was more uncertainty and higher volatility that paved the way.  
I remember thinking years ago about email "who woud I want to email" and utube "why would I ever want to watch somebody's home movies" so perceptions can and do change over time.
Bitcoin is one of those things that causes much controversy because you do literally have to buy into it if you believe in it. At any one point it leaves many feeling vindicated for buying low, many feeling stupid for buying high, many feeling sad for not buying at all and many feeling sick for selling early.

Altcoins might be irrelevant if you believe having one single viable secure blockchain is a good idea.  
Bitpay indicated a while ago that if anything disastrous should ever happen to Bitcoin then it would simply shift to the next most secure chain.  
I would say that altcoins decrease the incentive to mount such an attack, sure it could happen but blockchain based currency would continue and kill Bitcoin you would then need to kill litecoin , dogecoin , peercoin etc. etc.  
5% placed in a suitable alt you think might work in a worst case scenario such as a hijacking of the main Bitcoin mining facilities might be all you need to protect your blockchain wealth.

I initially bought a few bitcoin back in 2011 for around £10 each only to see the price gradually drop and drop and drop to the £2.00-£2.50 mark.  
I also had a tiny 1 gram silver Bitcoin art round produced which I sold for btc, at the time I needed to convert back to fiat ASAP to buy more stock etc. but I was tempted to hold in the hope the price would go up and make more profit, alas the price just kept tumbling down and down and down relentlessly. 
In reality Bitcoin is operational and it works right now, going through the sinking lows should be a right of passage it's character building it makes you question the choice you made to invest in the first place and when the next move higher comes and it will it's all the sweeter for it.

. Why not increase Litecoin's blocksize now as a differentiator, altcoins are supposed to be the melting pot of experimentation this at least would give those who want bigger blocks an alternative instead of Bitcoin XT. Now it seems obvious Bitcoin will have it's blocksize stifled by dev disputes, indecision and 3rd party interference, litecoin could have a chance to shine maybe you should move up front into the drivers seat or at least be chief navigator in the passenger seat. The back seat is a little like being swept along like a VIP or royalty.

I wouldn't say Litecoin's first halving had no effect on price, speculation regarding the halving built up over several months, litecoin is 3X up from its low of just over $1 and it was 8X up shortly before the halving. Even if that was pure speculation or parties using the hype to manipulate the price long term holders saw a huge rise in value of their LTC.    
    
If Bitcoin sees a similar move from $250 to $2000 and back down to $750 over a several month period leading up to the halving few Bitcoiners will conclude the halving had no effect on price, and that price rise will almost certainly be due to the reasons above rather a surge in new user adoption.

The chinese are a society of savers, Bitcoin can be traded between individuals and on exchanges over there, clearly bobby identifies china as a minIng powerhouse who are primarily interested in Bitcoin as an investment, store of value. 
 Its really nothing unusual or odd in the fact the primary use of Bitcoin in china isn't going to be buying goods with it in the short term. I presume that doesn't stop them buying goods in btc outside china.
