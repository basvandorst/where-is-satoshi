yea i just realized, i couldnt find the export button and i click on a post that was wrongfully saying it doesnt show private keys for security reasons (but it meant it was hidden). thanks a lot.

so a wallet is creating several private keys and separate it?

yea i kinda got that. but it seems like some wallets create several keys as default.

yea but each version of my bitcoin wallet works for itself. 
For example, I ahve the seed words that I used to create a wallet on my tablet and when I download the wallet on my desktop, I try to import the seed word but it does not work. and right now whatever I do the app on my tablet wont work,
So ithink it is safer to store the private keys somewhere else.
However, if I save only 1 private keys of all, will I have the control of my full amount of my wallet ?

I have seen this before, I hate every minute of it because you can tell that the child is somewhat been brainwashed even if it is true. She is saying it as if she learned a poem or something.

my thoughts it will start going down rapidly. however, people should start using bitcoin as a currency rather than just an investment.
