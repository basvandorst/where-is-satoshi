No way... its at an all time high. Definitely wait until after the fork.

Bet you 1 BTC that men created this for them! I doubt they could make a crypo with a gender studies degree. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:43:20
Knew it!

No way... why buy something at an all time high? Wait until after the fork!

Long term yes... but after each fork it usually crashes once people got their free coins

Excellent, I’ve loaded up with alts and waiting for the pump. After that I’ll transfer the profit from the alts into bitcoin when it’s at a lower price. Always do the opposite of the herd and you’ll profit.

Agreed. Won’t be much longer before a huge correction similar to 2013. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:04:04
No way this can be sustainable. It is currently overvalued according to RSI. There is definitely going to be a correction soon, no doubt about it.

Ah yeah, I guess it does make a difference in how much your net worth is... I'm talking about people with a reasonable amount of wealth, perhaps someone established in their career, at least 30 years old. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:33:38
I'm guessing it was some time ago then when it was cheap?

Best exchange with lowest rates to buy bitcoin in Australia is independent reserve at 0.5% transaction fee. 
Best wallet to use is probably bread wallet or a hardware wallet for larger amounts. 
Anonymous? You mean when singing up to the exchange? No. They all require your details for verification. 
What do you mean by affecting Centrelink? As in earnings? If you sell bitcoin for cash then yes. However if you hodl and/or only spend bitcoin then no. There aren’t too many places that accept bitcoin payments yet but it’s growing. 
Also please don’t spend all your dole money on bitcoin - although I guess it’s better than blowing it on alcohol/cigarettes. Only spend what you can afford to lose.

History has a habit of repeating itself. What makes you think it can continue with exponential growth forever? There will always be corrections along the way, but the overall trend will be up. If you HODL long term then you won't be losing. Corrections just make it cheaper for newbies to get into the market. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:15:09
It is due for a major correction very soon and looks similar to the lead up to the crash in 2013. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:21:55
yeah true, just curious how much most are investing. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:24:58
5600... that was the last support line and since then you can see a clear spike. However it could go even lower if we see an even bigger correction. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:34:42
Are you all forgetting the crash that took place in 2013? It WILL happen again. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:46:32
Wow triggered much? Yes I do think it will take off long term. However short term there will be a crash which will then eventually recover. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:30:26
Well what percentage of it was it when you bought it? 
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:15:04
I've seen many guys here say they put their entire life savings into bitcoin! That risk is just too high for me. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:42:13
Wow, should be seeing a nice healthy correction very soon!

Once you've signed up to an exchange (eg independent reserve) you can either do instant payment with POLI ($3.30 fee), or bank transfer which is free but takes a few days. Once the money has arrived you can purchase bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:13:16
5600 now... looks like I was right.
