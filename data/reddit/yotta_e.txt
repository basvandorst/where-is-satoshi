We are very new in bitcoin world, but we do international wholesale business for quite a while. 
Even our company logo is not ready yet, but we can't help share our product with bitcoin community. 
We have warehouse in Delaware USA and Dubai Airport Freezone. We will post some photo when our logo design contest is concluded.

We pre-order lots of Nexus 6 from google. But we don't know how many devices google will ship to us, so we do not offer pre-order right now. As soon as google ships them, we will take orders. We have iPhone/blackberry passport available for order. Moreover, we welcome international orders! Please subscribe to our mailing list for more announcement. Thanks for your attention! 
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:10:13
We lose money on your order, the coupon code we give out can only be used for 10 times. Even without coupon code, we just break even on iTunes gift card business. We hope iTunes card can attract more customers to our store, so that we can sell other product with higher margin.
Yes, we are a micro self-funded startup, but we care about our customers more than the big guys do. Wish we could meet at Dubai Bitcoin Conference this year. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 12:53:20
With the coupon, you can buy a $25 gift card for $15. Why not give us a try?

Microsoft store just cancelled my surface pro 3 order paid by a credit card. I buy from them because they run a promotion. I need a windows because stupid chinese banking software require a hardware security key which needs a physical machine. Windows runs in virtualbox won't work. I buy surface pro because other laptop has too much bloatware. Microsoft is a trap. Even if they accept and support bitcoin, I wish they will go to the hell.

Chinese exchanges let you deposit Chinese yuan instantly. Most western exchanges don't have such capability. I am a Chinese. I have Chinese yuan, US dollars and AED in my accounts. When I try to catch a up trend. Chinese yuan is my only choice. USD takes too much time to deposit into my account let alone high remittance fees. Another reason is Chinese exchange has no fees and the price is lower than western competitors.  
Buy bitcoin is hard for Westerners, that's the reason why purse.io is still in business.

Wake up, Dubai is the most free country for foreign works. Come and visit Dubai, not just listen to the propaganda.
If you are a poor Asian/African, you won't be able to go to the land of free or any developed country. For Dubai, just pay $100 for the visa and a air ticket, you can come at any time. If you find a job during your 30 day tourist visa period, you can switch to a 2 year work visa. 
As a businessman, I can issue work visa for my friends/parents/relatives which is not possible in USA. You have to be the slaves of capitalist, or you have to be a capitalist yourself to maintain your "legal" status.
The healthcare here is really cheap, nobody file personal bankruptcy because of healthcare bills. Even without insurance, go to a hospital only cost you under $50. You pay money for the medicine, not the bureaucracy.
The community is very safe, I walk and carry lots of cash in the late night without fear of robbery. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 13:36:36
Yes, that's exactly why we start yotta-e.com which beat the price of mainstream retailers.
Consumers acceptance only happens when consumers find bitcoin can get them cheaper products.
So tell your friends, only bitcoin can get them 8% discount on iTunes Gift Card, 4% discount on Google Play Gift Card everyday.

The problem with bitcoin ecosystem is that even I am losing money on this sale, not many people want to buy from me. I think most of bitcoin business is operating at a loss right now. Many bitcoiners prefer spend 20% more on purse.io to buy bitcoin so that they don't have to give away their identity to companies like coinbase etc.
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:13:48
